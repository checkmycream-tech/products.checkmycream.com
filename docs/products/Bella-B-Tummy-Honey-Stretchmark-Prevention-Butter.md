      <li>I guess if you are not allergic to it, it&#x27;s a great cream.    </li>
      <li>This product works great and would recommend it to anyone who is expecting.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s why it stays on so great.</li>
      <li>It has a very pleasant, light scent that is perfect for pregnancy, even when I had morning sickness.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff!!  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>Love this product!!</li>

      <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
      <li>This product smells AMAZING!</li>
      <li>I bought this under recommendation of a friend and it has been amazing!</li>
      <li>It has the most wonderful honey scent and goes on just as it says - like butter.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice too!</li>
      <li>Love all the great ingredients too!</li>
      <li>And the smell is really pleasant- a mixture of honey and sugar cookie smell.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t overly oily or sticky, had a pleasant scent that wasn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m 33+ weeks along, so it&#x27;s really good for that.</li>
      <li>I loved the feel and absorption of that product but stopped using it because it contains Willowood extract.</li>
      <li>I plan to put it on before bed or a couple of hours before a shower so it doesn&#x27;t get on any good clothes.</li>
      <li>Which is surprising because the container states that it is hypoallergenic and has an Anti-itch Formula.  </li>
      <li>so once again I was thinking there would be a good chance I would end up with them</li>
      <li>so deserves my good review.</li>
      <li>I loved the smell.</li>
      <li>Because of my happiness with this product I have also ordered the breast feeding wipes and lotion.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smell love the thickness of the lotion. My top pick!</li>
    <li> Not to be the bearer of bad news but no amount of &amp;#34;tummy butter&amp;#34; can prevent stretch marks. If you get them, blame your mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT this cream is great to sooth stretching, itchy skin. It smells good and goes on smoothly. It&#x27;s greaser than a lotion but I actually liked the consistency of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times so far and it seems like an ok product. It smells good, but is a little greasy. I read some reviews before purchasing it so had an idea what it might be like. I&#x27;ve only used it at night before bed so the greasiness doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. If you&#x27;re looking for more of a cream, I wouldn&#x27;t get this product, but if you&#x27;re just looking for something that might help prevent stretch marks, I would give it a try. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to know if it will really help with the stretch marks though.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;butter\\&quot; is just like a thick vaseline and sticks to my clothes. I hate the feeling of it on my hands and would have to wash it off after applying to my stomach. I&#x27;m 6 months along, and it did keep the itch away; however, I had to wait 15 minutes in the morning for enough to absorb that I could put my clothes on and not have all of it rub off. Although the price is much less than other products I&#x27;ve read reviews on, I used up the whole tub (applying liberally once a day) in less than a month. I used the Burt&#x27;s Bees tummy butter originally, and that was cheaper and lasted a good 2 months. I loved the feel and absorption of that product but stopped using it because it contains Willowood extract. Not sure how serious of a concern that should be, but I don&#x27;t take any chances when it comes to pregnancy. I guess I&#x27;ll try the Mama Mio butter next.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only half way through my pregnancy, so I cant really say much about this product preventing stretch marks...but what I AM very impressed by is the fact that it barely has any smell (cocoa butter might be effective but the scent is SO overwhelming) I also like that its not greasy or too liquidy. Perfect smell (or non smell), perfect consistency.    Really hoping for a stretch mark success story. So far, so good but the real test happens when I hit my 8th and 9th months...wish me luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 4th month so I&#x27;m not big enough to get stretch marks yet, but I&#x27;ve been using the Tummy Honey Butter every night.  It smells delicious!  I was very sick with morning sickness and this still smelled good.  It is thick and greasy, so I only use it at night and use another product in the morning.  I hope it works like other people have said it does.</li>
    <li> I liked this product for the first 10 days or so.  After that it was no longer smooth even though I always put it on clean skin.  Now when I first put it on is is grainy.  After it is absorbed it is fine but the applying process is less than desireable.</li>
    <li> I started using Bella B Tummy Honey Butter in my first trimester and continued using it until I ran out of it 4 months after I delivered.  I am proud to say that it was helpful in preventing stretch marks on my hips, tummy, thighs and breasts.  I applied it once a day - after bathing- while my skin was damp, before I went to bed.  A little goes a long way.  I highly advise any mom-to-be to consider purchasing this. I was sick most of my pregnancy and found the smell to be very subtle and very pleasant!</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I was excited to use this product. I think it would be better described as a salve, it is thick and sticky, difficult to spread on, and just sits there, leaving your belly sticky, and your shirt then sticks to your belly. Its kind of really gross. I only put it on at bedtime, because it really soils your shirt, and the smell is just too strong and perfumey for this pregnant nose! Really dissapointed with this product, and will be going back to the cocoa butter which moisturizes well and doesnt leave such an oily and uncomfortable residue.</li>
    <li> I have tried several types of stretch mark prevention items during my pregnancy.  I am currently 35 weeks and this is my favorite product I&#x27;ve tried.  So far it has worked the way it should (I don&#x27;t want to jinx myself :))and I am going to order a 2nd one for the last 5 weeks of my pregnancy.  I use it twice a day, once in the morning after my shower and once at night before bed.  Some people complained about it being too greasy but I personally love the consistency of this.  It is moisturizing enough to keep my skin from feeling tight and the \\&quot;grease\\&quot; did not transfer to any of my clothing.  Plus it smells really good!  I had morning sickness and started out with a scented almond oil and now cannot stand the smell of it.  I think if I orginally had started with the Bella B tummy butter I would not have had the same problem because the scent is so light and clean smelling.  Also, I did not notice that it lightened my previous stretchmarks from my teenage years as some reviewers said but would still recommend this.  I will be buying this for all my friends when they find out they are pregnant!</li>
    <li> With my first pregnancy, I used a cocoa butter based cream on my belly for itching/stretch marks, but wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the results. It helped with the itching, but I still got stretch marks and I really didn&#x27;t care for the smell. So, with my second pregnancy, I decided to find something better. I researched and read reviews and decided on the Bella B Tummy Honey Butter. I love it. I have no new stretch marks to date and it&#x27;s fading the existing ones from my first pregnancy. The texture is definitely different than what you&#x27;ve used in the past - much drier and you have to work to rub it in. I really like the light floral smell too, and I&#x27;ve got a very sensitive pregnant nose. I will definitely recommend this product to anyone who asks</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd pregnancy and have used this Tummy Honey Butter for my first child and now using it for my second and it has worked very well for me. I have no stretch marks what so ever. Yes, it is greasy but if you wait 10 minutes before putting on your clothes you will be fine. You MUST put it on twice a day so that it works. Morning and Night and you are good to go...Texture is smooth and smells good. Good Luck!!</li>
    <li> I used this butter twice a day, everyday on my belly during pregnancy and it really worked. I thought avoiding stretch marks was impossible, but this belly butter was amazing. I have stretch marks on my hips from puberty so I know I am prone to get them, but this butter kept them away from my stomach! It is a little greasy (Kind of like vasaline) and will rub on your clothes but it doesnt stain and it is totally worth it. I just wore camis under my clothes so your shirt wont stick to your belly. Buy it and use it!</li>
    <li> Smells nice at first but my SCENT was so sensitive that I had to go wash my belly off!!  Too scented for preggos in my opinion.  I smelled it the other day and it smells okay.. Still a bit strong to be rubbed all over.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I used 3 jars during my pregnancy, now 38 weeks and no stretch marks even though my mom had some, I used it just on my stomach every morning and sometimes at night.  The product feels nice if the skin gets dry and itchy.  I&#x27;m very picky about the smell as I get allergies very easily, this product has a settled smell that didn&#x27;t bother me. The only thing, I suggest to wait until the product gets absorbed or wipe it off as it easily can get on your clothes and sheets, the stains washes off in the laundry, but still may want to consider this aspect.</li>
    <li> Two pregnancies not one stretchmark ! Seriously worth every penny : )</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for every pregnancy and i have 3 children. I love the smell and just how moisturizing it is. I have not gotten stretch marks and i swear its from using this product 2x a day faithfully. I would deffinitely recomend it !</li>
    <li> I started using Bella B Tummy Honey Butter when I was around 30 weeks pregnant (with twins).  I previously used Palmers Tummy Butter, but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  When looking for it online, I came across this and after reading all the positive reviews decided to give it a try.  I was having a lot of problems with itching.  I can honestly say it hasn&#x27;t offered relief for me personally from that standpoint.  I since have begun having problems with my entire body itching and can&#x27;t seem to get much relief.  I&#x27;ve tried many different topical products to no avail.  My OB says it is due to hormones and since I am allergic to benadryl there really isn&#x27;t anything that is safe for both me and the boys to try.  So, I won&#x27;t blame this product for not getting rid of the itch problem.  Anyway, I slather this on very liberally every night.  It is not \\&quot;non-greasy\\&quot;.  I wear a cotton camisole to bed each night so as not to make a mess of my sheets.  It does seem to soak into my hands rather quickly, though.  A tub will last me right at two weeks.  The first two tubs I bought (in my first shipment) the texture was a bit gritty, but not in a rough, scratchy, irritating way.  The third tub that I have begun using (different shipment) is not gritty, but rather very smooth.  At 35 weeks pregnant now with just over 11 lbs of babies in me, my belly has really blossomed.  I swear I&#x27;m bigger at lunchtime than I am when I get up in the morning. :-D  I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark, at all, anywhere!  I attribute it as much to this as anything.</li>
    <li> Bought this cream since it has strong ratings on amazon. Bought it, tried it, and LOVED it. And the most important thing is this stuff works WONDER! I&#x27;m on my second jar now, and currently on my second trimester going third trimester. I put this moisturizer liberally twice a day, morning and evening right after my daily shower. The smell is not too overpowering, slightly smell like honey, which is good for those who are still in their first trimester and struggling with nausea and vomiting. So far, I have no stretch marks whatsoever. And I will continue using this cream religiously even after I deliver my baby. Highly recommended for those who are still looking for belly rub during pregnancy. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This is my first pregnancy, I have been using this product since I was about 5 months pregnant.  I am not sure if I haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks because I am lucky and it is genetics or whether this product is to thank, but I am now in my 9th month and I only have a few tiny marks on my hips where I was not applying the product initially.  I love that it uses natural ingredients.  It also smells nice and you don&#x27;t need to use very much at a time.  It does not leave me feeling greasy either, which I like.  Great product, would buy again!</li>
    <li> After reading the &#x27;1 star&#x27; review of this product, I had to check my medicine cabinet to see what &#x27;formulation&#x27; of this product I had used during my last pregnancy.  I apparently never used the original formula version of this product, so I can&#x27;t make any comparison.  I will say, however, that I was very happy with using this product in my last pregnancy, and I have purchased more to use the second time around.  I have ZERO stretch marks from my first, and I attribute this at least in part to having used a daily moisturizer like the Tummy Honey Butter.  I understand that there are other factors at play, but results were great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it is notably a little &#x27;thick&#x27; or &#x27;sticky&#x27; as a product in general.  You shouldn&#x27;t have the expectation that this is like a normal lotion or creamy body butter.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it in terms of ruining clothes as someone suggested.  I use this each day right after a shower, and I&#x27;m always pleased that my skin is still moisturized and supple when I go to shower the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using this with both pregnancies at about 4 months.  It ended up taking about 2 of the 4-oz jars for a whole pregnancy, which seemed reasonable to me.  Seems to work great!</li>
    <li> I started using this product early in my pregnancy to prevent stretch marks. I was skeptical at first, because it was greasier than I expected. I kept using it, but only at night because I didn&#x27;t want my clothes to get greasy during the day. I am now 7.5 months pregnant and still slather it on my belly and hips every night, and I don&#x27;t have one stretch mark to speak of! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s genetics or this product, but I&#x27;m a believer. Plus I don&#x27;t have itchy skin like many pregnant women complain about. Hopefully the current jar will get me through all 9 months!</li>
    <li> I used this when I was pregnant with my son and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks!  Not sure if it was the belly butter or good genes, but I loved this stuff!</li>
    <li> Smells and feels great. Not greasy</li>
    <li> The only thing this product has going for it is the smell.  It is not offensive, smells nice, and does not trigger the morning-sickness gag-button.  However, it does not work. I used it several times a day, and really layered it on...stretch marks found a home anyway.  In the container the goop is solid, and becomes more vaseline-like as you apply it.  Also, I was not expecting the graininess.  It feels like there is sand in it.  Most importantly, it does not keep the \\&quot;moisturized\\&quot; feeling throughout the day.  It leaves a dry, shiny film.  I am very disappointed, especially since this was not the cheapest product on the market.  I recommend going with Lay It On Thick from B&amp;BWorks.  And increase your water intake.  Good Luck.</li>
    <li> It smells good, and so far, there are no stretch marks.  It costs a bit to buy, but it lasts long so it&#x27;s worth it.  Overall, pretty happy I bought this for my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I used Bella B Tummy Honey Butter through my entire pregnancy, starting early in my first trimester and I loved it.  No strech marks at all on my belly, and it helped sooth any itching. Not to mention compared to similare products on the mareket, Bella B is really reasonably priced.  I would reccomend this to any mommy-to-be, and I buy it for all of my friends who are expecting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m barely 20 weeks so, I don&#x27;t have stretch marks yet. I bought this as prevention so, only time will tell. It smells sooooo good and it warms up as you rub it in which I really like. It&#x27;s a bit too thick and greasy to wear during the day so, I only used it at night. Will rebuy.</li>
    <li> I used the original formula with my first 2 children, this pregnancy I purchased my tummy honey as usual but all of the ingredients have been changed, and it doesn&#x27;t work well at all. The company was bought out by giant LEARNING CURVE who then replaced all the quality ingredients with cheaper stuff that doesn&#x27;t work and added a bunch of perfume instead to mimic the herbal smell. I&#x27;m REALLY not happy with the new formula, it causes my skin to itch - most likely due to the high amount of undisclosed chemicals in the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; ingredient which is present in VERY large amounts of the new formula. VERY disappointed long time customer here.</li>
    <li> I am 36 weeks and 1 day pregnant and I&#x27;ve been using Bella B Tummy Honey Butter since about 15 weeks. I&#x27;m on amazon to buy another tub of it b/c I don&#x27;t want to risk running out before I deliver. I&#x27;m really paranoid about being able to wear a swim suit again (I&#x27;m only 25!) so I wanted something that WORKS. So far, the only stretch mark I&#x27;ve gotten this pregnancy is a tiny red mark on my belly button piercing, but like I read in another review--that skin was already compromised :)    I like this product because it keeps me moisturized all day long. It is greasy and it will stain your clothes, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t fully absorb into your skin. If you&#x27;re wearing maternity jeans that go almost up to your armpits, though, it doesn&#x27;t matter :) I originally bought a cocoa butter formula during my first trimester, but the smell was so offensive. Just last week I finally threw it away because all these months later, I still can&#x27;t stand to smell it! I would definitely recommend this product. It&#x27;s a little pricy, but so worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife, and not only did it feel like a tub of vaseline but it also made her itch all over. Because it&#x27;s \\&quot;hypo-allergenic\\&quot; and all natural (except for all the chemicals listed in the ingredients), we thought it couldn&#x27;t be the tummy butter. However, after going a couple days without using it then trying it again the wife broke out in itchy red splotches all over her belly.</li>
    <li> --Update--  I am now through my second pregnancy and I am happy to say that once again I have no stretch marks!  This time around my son was 10 days late, a pound heavier than my daughter and I carried him all in front so once again I was thinking there would be a good chance I would end up with them but I was pleasantly surprised.  I would still recommend this to anyone.  Also I only used two containers for the entire pregnancy starting in my second month.  -----------    I used this from the end of my first trimester on in my first pregnancy and I am happy to report that I am back for more (on my second pregnancy) because I had no stretch marks at all, and my daughter was 9 days late even!  I bought it because I was determined to at least TRY to avoid them.  I was certain I would get them during pregnancy because despite being thin I ended up with quite a few in high school growth spurts and seemed very prone to them.    PROS  1.  This was the only product I could stand the smell of when I was experiencing 1st tri nausea, it&#x27;s a very mild scent.  2.  Even at the end of the day my skin still feels like it is being protected... not dry or itchy.  3.  Of course the obvious one, I experienced no stretch marks.    CONS  1.  Yes it is a bit pricey but it&#x27;s well worth it.  I don&#x27;t think I had to buy more than 3 the first time around.  I have been using it now for all of Feb and it&#x27;s around 1/4 gone.    I have read other reviews regarding the consistency of this product and the fact that some people still got stretch marks and just wanted to add a couple of comments.    I use this very sparingly... I find that even a very light layer seems to do the trick and I let it sit for a few minutes before dressing.  I never had any stains on my clothes doing it this way and my skin never felt \\&quot;goopy\\&quot; or wet.    I tried very hard to stick to the recommended pregnancy weight gain (1 lb/week for most of the pregnancy.)  I had a few 2 pound weeks but I suspect that had I had a 5 poundweek near the end I may have ended up with marks... there is just only so much a body can handle.  So perhaps it was my diligence on weight gain that got me through but I won&#x27;t be taking any chances the second time around.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommened this prduct.  I am/was a person who was very prone to strech marks.  I have lots of them left over from being an overweight teen and though it was a sure thing when I got pregnant.  I though I would try the product since it got so many positive reviews and as it was paraben free, I didn&#x27;t need to worry about the effects it would have on me or the baby.  I started using it at around 3 months and went through two jars before the end of the pregnancy. I never had an ichy tummy, not a single strech mark and my tummy has never been so soft and smoothe.  It&#x27;s a great product that I will certainly use for my next pregnancy and recommened it to others.  It is no garentee, but it worked for me.</li>
    <li> Good product, but I like Momma Mio better, not as greasey, so you can wear it under clothes</li>
    <li> This stuff is so amazing I wish I could put it on my entire body, but that would start getting expensive!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely a must for pregnancy!!!</li>
    <li> This product alleviates itching and painful skin stretching but leaves your belly greasy. You defintely don&#x27;t want to put this product on without a tank or tee to absorb the greasy \\&quot;butter.\\&quot;  Otherwise you run the risk of ruining a shirt or sweater.  It is too early to tell if this really prevents stretch marks since I am only 5 1/2 months along. But so far so good.  We currently live in a very dry winter climate. While I am constantly applying lotions and creams to the rest of my body, I only need to apply the tummy honey butter once a day.  I would with the above reservation recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted something mostly natural but cannot stand the smell of cocoa butter.  This stuff is amazing!  It has the most wonderful honey scent and goes on just as it says - like butter.  Be warned - some people really dislike the feeling of it.  It is MUCH thicker than a lotion and is almost like a salve with a consistency close to that of Neosporin or Vasoline.  However, in the second and third trimesters of my pregnancy my belly was so stretched out and itchy that it felt like heaven when I put it on and kept my tummy moisturized all day long.  I only used it after a shower and only about once or twice a week as a cautionary step.  I would put on my maternity pants (the kind with the stretchy part that goes the whole way up - \\&quot;secret fit\\&quot;) and that helped to keep the moisture locked in.  By the end of the day my skin was sooo soft.  I would recommend letting it set on your belly for a few minutes before getting dressed, otherwise it can get kinda gross feeling.  I found it to be really beneficial on my hips and inner thighs as well.</li>
    <li> I used this cream starting at the begining of my second trimester.  I put it on right after showering.  If I ever forgot, I had itching within 3 hours!!  I didn&#x27;t get any stretchmarks!!  I also took some other peoples advice and applied it to my hips and bottom (besides my belly).  I recommend it to every prego woman!</li>
    <li> I am so in LOVE with this product and the Bella B line. My friend got some samples from her OBGYN and I used one. The smell was so amazing it was very light and not greasy or sticky at all. I am NOT a lotion person. I had some stretch marks from puberty and I am light skin mixed women so every scar is very noticeable. I bought it online from Amazon to try it out and noticed some results in about two weeks. My \\&quot;wormies\\&quot; had become lighter and more flat and smooth. I tried all three stretch mark products the cream, butter, and the stick and now you cant even tell I had any. I love how this product makes me feel and as a mixed woman, my skin is very sensitive. Now I use it faithfully daily. Its a little pricey but worth the money, just make sure you purchase about two of each, because trust me you WILL fall in love with it.</li>
    <li> sure didn&#x27;t prevent stretch marks for me! very oily, waste of time putting it on everyday and money for sure, sucks :(</li>
    <li> I bought Bella B Tummy Honey Butter for my pregnant wife (is our second baby girl) and she really likes it. Has no odor and feels good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, goes on smooth, fun for me to rub on her belly (and other parts). Doesn&#x27;t taste so good when I give my baby in her belly a goodnight kiss.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this product because I developed really itchy skin in early pregnancy. It helps, but the product leaves my legs feeling sort of oily. The smell is light, so it doesn&#x27;t set me off since my nose is really sensitive right now.    The butter is almost the consistency of Vasoline.</li>
    <li> I am six months pregnant with twins (going on 7 months) and not one stretch mark has appeared! I can not say enough good things about Bella B Tummy Honey Butter! Of course I am not to term yet, but I am very pleased, as you can imagine how big my tummy is right now!    Susies Twins</li>
    <li> I am in my 7th month, and I have no stretch marks (yet). It is said that their appearance is mostly determined by genetics, but I feel like I help mother nature if I use a cream.&lt;br /&gt;I only use this butter before going to bed. It is quite thick and sticky, and would not wear it during the day when I am at work.&lt;br /&gt;During the day, I use the much lighter [[ASIN:B002B46H6Y Mustela Stretch Marks Double Action - 5.07 oz.]]. This one is more expensive, but allows me to wear my daily clothes without staining or stickiness.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and isn&#x27;t too greasy, though watch out for your clothes. I got just a little bit on my shirt the first day I used it and it left a stain. Just make sure to let it soak in a bit before dressing! Otherwise, it&#x27;s doing the trick. I use a light layer under Palmers for stretch marks and it&#x27;s been a good combo.</li>
    <li> During my last pregnancy I used Burt Bees Belly Balm and really liked it but saw the Bella B while browsing Amazon and decided to give it a try. It goes on very easy unlike the Burt Bees that would sometimes clump and not spread. It is greasy when first applied but absorbs fairly quickly. I have not used one belly butter or balm that has not been greasy when first put on. I did not notice a gritty texture like some of the other reviews mentioned. I thought it was very smooth. I did not get stretch marks during my last pregnancy and am 23 weeks now and do not have any. Last pregnancy I did suffer itchy tummy and have not this pregnancy. So I believe this product does help with the dry itchy belly problem. I use the Bella B and vitamin E oil or Emu oil and it has worked very well so far and am hoping for another stretch mark free pregnancy!</li>
    <li> its thick. more like a dense petroleum jelly. it makes me feel like its preventing the stretch marks even though I&#x27;m not certain it does. it feels like you are rubbing hair gel that never dries on your skin. i just put a tank top on and try to soak it up. you defiantly feel sticky and a little icky for a day or two even after washing it off.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife who is pregnant and she has used this every day. It really does make a difference and I highly recommend this for anyone looking to keep stretch marks down while pregnant.</li>
    <li> With all the good reviews and hype about it you would think Bella B Tummy Honey Butter would work. Stretch mark prevention? More like a drunken challenge with stretch mark to a vicious battle and losing badly. It felt greasy on my skin, my clothes got greasy and even though I washed my hands it felt like the grease would never go away. For all I know I could have been rubbing lard on my tummy. My skin felt itchy from all the stretching and adding grease to the itchy tummy just made it difficult to scratch. I&#x27;ve used it since I was 3 months pregnant and still came out of the pregnancy with warrior scars. I know stretch marks are genetic but I was hoping this would at least soothe the itch away. It didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I liked about the Bella B Tummy Honey Butter was that it smelled nice. It reminded me of Anthropologie or Urban Outfitters candles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ll post up my embarrassing zebra patterned tummy later on.</li>
    <li> I did not mean rude, but I really do not like this product. It is very greasy and hard to obsorb. And it is funny, last night my tummy was not itchy before I put this product on, but after I had this product on my tummy, it started itchy for hours... So I had to wash it off and put on the other product that I have, and the itchy feeling went away. It is very greasy and sticky. It does have a pleasant smell and the ingrediants are mostly organic and vege-based.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 2 months. So far, I have no stretch marks(4 and half month pregnant and I was quite thin).&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit hard to rub in &#x27;cause it is quite greasy. but I do believe the heavy stuff should work better.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is Okay and I don&#x27;t find it stinky or unbearable the next morning. Like other reviewers said, it does&lt;br /&gt;make your clothes a little greasy, but come on, what is more important? no stretch marks or washing your jammies more often? And it is really not that bad!</li>
    <li> I love this tummy butter. Although I was sad to see the price increase recently (thank God I&#x27;m not pregnant any more), this is by far the best tummy butter for pregnancy. I didn&#x27;t get one stretch mark on my belly or breasts and I put on 35 pounds! I used this butter from my 5 month marker until my 9 month marker (they increased the price so I tried something different for a couple of week...didn&#x27;t like the other stuff). This butter is not oily and does not come off on clothes. I would strongly recommend this item to any of the others out there!!!</li>
    <li> I received this product the next day after I ordered it! I opened it up and dug in! it has a nice solid but smooth consistency. It does not smell bad like some of the other reviews say, it has a fresh natural smell unless you are extremely sensitive to scent I don&#x27;t know. It kind of looks like wax and feels a little waxy but buttery too its a super nice texture though and went on medium thick and smooth it felt a little grainy at first but it really soaked into my skin. Overall I like it already can&#x27;t wait to see the results. Love all the great ingredients too!</li>
    <li> I really loved Bella B Tummy Honey Butter. A little goes a long way and it is thick, so applications last a while unlike other products and it smells good too. The only thing that I did not like was the greasiness of the product.</li>
    <li> After being warned that stretch marks were inevitable, I searched the market for a miracle cream that would prevent it and I found it! I used Bella B tummy butter morning and night throughout my pregnancy and it totally worked at preventing stretch marks. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed with this belly butter...it is greasy and grainy and does not absorb into the skin. I bought it because of the great reviews, but am not sure how anyone can enjoy wearing this if they actually have to put clothing on after applying it.    After application, I could not get the oily film it left on my hands off with soap and water - I had to use a towel to scrub it off. After lying around without a shirt for an hour or so to hope it would absorb, I gave up and put an old shirt on before going to sleep. When I woke up, the oily residue had penetrated my shirt and left a film all over my good sheets.     I can&#x27;t imagine having to apply this mess of a belly butter in the morning before work...not a pretty side to have it absorb through my clothing as the day passes.    Even if this product did prevent stretch marks, I can&#x27;t see how anyone could actually use it unless they were able to walk around topless all day. I won&#x27;t wait around to find out - I&#x27;ll be looking for an alternative that&#x27;s actually usable and doesn&#x27;t make you feel like an oily, greasy, mess.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister&#x3D;in-law who is currently 14 weeks along in her first pregnancy.  I had read the reviews, and figured this had the best results for the price.  My sister-in-law said it is so greasy that she can only put in on at night with layered shirts.  I&#x27;m not sure if she&#x27;s even using it anymore.  It&#x27;s way to soon to  tell if it works, but if it does, the fact that it&#x27;s greasy won&#x27;t really matter.</li>
    <li> i bought this after the product i was using ran out.  i love the smell!!!  i use it only at night, b/c the skin does stay oily after applying, but i don&#x27;t mind getting a little residue on my night clothes - and it all washes out and does not stain.  i use a plain shea butter in the morinings b/c it rubs into the skin better.  but i love putting it on at night b/c it smells so good.  i have only been using it about 2 weeks so i can&#x27;t speak to its ability to prevent stretch marks at this point.  most of the other reviews were good so i can&#x27;t wait to see how it works for the next 8 weeks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and like other reviewers said, it&#x27;s a little greasy but it works well. I&#x27;m 24 weeks pregnant now and so far no stretch mark on my belly yet. I apply it in the morning and evening right after shower. Let&#x27;s see how it works down the road...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bella B Tummy Honey Butter through 2 pregnancies and now in the middle of my 3rd with zero stretch marks! I&#x27;d say the product works wonderfully! Even if it didn&#x27;t prevent the stretch marks it does wonders for a dry itchy belly! :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have used this tummy butter since I was 12 weeks pregnant and ended up with not a single stretch mark on my stomach! I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I got this product from a friend and I&#x27;ll tell you how it ranks with the 2 other stretch mark products that I use. One is the very expensive Clarins Stretch Mark Control lotion (which was not worth the price at all), and my favorite the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Oil. Let me first describe what you&#x27;ll experience when applying the Bella B product: imagine slathering Vaseline all over your belly, except the Vaseline feels like it has something weird and gritty/grainy in it. And it does not absorb well, even after hours later it still feels like you slathered Vaseline all over your belly. The plus side is if you get super dry in the winter, you can alternate this with other products to boost moisturization. The scent is not bad, either. I actually found that I liked to use it when I wore a pair of maternity jeans with a full belly panel that always slid down, but would not slide down if I had this stuff on my belly! (Yes it is sticky like that.) My favorite is the Mama Mio Tummy Rub oil. For being an oil, it absorbs remarkably well, smells divine, and is very easy and quick to apply. I use it the most of any of the others and I have not gotten any stretch marks, knock-on-wood, as I&#x27;m in my 37th week of pregnancy. The Clarins one felt like a normal lotion (no different for its $50 price tag), did not have a scent, and would not stop me from getting itchy like the other two. To sum up: don&#x27;t buy this product unless you have super dry skin, wear a lot of full belly panel pants, and don&#x27;t mind applying something that is the consistancy of Vaseline to a large area on your body. I would definately recommend going with the Mamma Mio Tummy Rub Oil instead.</li>
    <li> This product smells AMAZING! More like a balm than a butter, it&#x27;s soft and easy to scoop with the fingers, and melts quickly to a thick honey-oil consistency when warmed between the hands. Although it is very slightly greasy when first applied, it soaks in quickly and lasts for hours. Plus it smells sooo good! Very light and subtle, like fresh honey and flowers it smells better than any other stretch mark cream i have tried yet. I just purchased my second order and most likely will purchase again when that runs out. This honey butter costs a little more than some, but I definitely think it&#x27;s worth it for how great it makes my skin feel. I&#x27;m eight months pregnant and so far, no stretch marks! Although, I have also been using regular cocoa butter tummy butter cream as well as the bella bee honey butter so I can&#x27;t promise which one is responsible for keeping my skin stretch-mark free, but I credit them both for that. Bella B honey butter is so easy to apply, smells great, and lasts all day relieving my tight itchy skin I HIGHLY recommend all pregnant women to try it!</li>
    <li> I was not very happy with this product.  The butter is very thick and extremely greasy.  I would only put this on at night, because I didn&#x27;t mind so much if my pajamas stuck to it (it is very sticky).  I would never use it during the day under normal clothes for fear of staining.  The butter is also really gritty and grainy.  My tummy did not like it because as soon as I started to use the butter, my belly broke out with little bumps all over it.  The only pros are that it is thick and it stays on your skin for a long time, but the cons out way the pros.  I will not purchase this butter again.  I can&#x27;t say if it works at preventing stretch marks since I used it early on in my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was a little skeptical the first time I put this on, but after wearing it I can&#x27;t imagine life without it!  It is sticky-ish, but it feels soooo good on an itchy, stretching belly.  This is my fourth child, so unfortunately it&#x27;s too late for me to not get stretch marks, but I really love the way my skin feels after putting it on.</li>
    <li> I love this. Have been using it throughout my pregnancy and no stretch marks yet. It has a comfortable scent and keeps my belly smooth and itch free. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Loved this butter.  Goes on without a strong smell.  Feels greasy at first but absorbs quickly.  Helped with itching and stretch mark prevention.</li>
    <li> This is my second pregnancy and I just purchased 5 bottles because with my first pregnancy it really worked.  My mom has terrible stretch marks and I got them during puberty around my thighs and butt so when I became pregnant I thought that I was destined to get stretch marks all over my stomach like my mom but I was not willing to give up that easy I thought I am going to fight this.  So as soon as I found out I was pregnant I started using Bella B tummy butter twice a day at morning and night.  I would apply it all over breasts, tummy, and thighs and butt. I was very sensitive to odors but found this one to have a very light scent. I always wore an undershirt to prevent the oils from rubbing off on my clothes.  It never stained my undershirts but I felt more comfortable that way.  I did not begin to show till I was about 3-4 months pregnant and I think it really helped by preparing my body for what was to come. During my pregnancy I gained nearly 40 pounds and did not get one stretch mark.  I really believe in this product but you have to dedicate yourself to use it as often as you can.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Bella B Tummy Honey Butter since week 12 and I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks.  I am at week 30 now and I am hoping this magical stuff will keep working.  The butter has also really helped with my itchy skin- from everything getting bigger!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this when I was pregnant. I won&#x27;t say that it prevented stretch marks but I didn&#x27;t get very many and the smell is really nice.</li>
    <li> I am now 32 weeks pregnant and have been using this product for a while now. No itchy stomach and so far.......(fingers crossed)......no streatch marks. The product is a little greasy but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much. Would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:35019701]]This is a video review of Bella B Tummy Honey Butter. For more health &amp; beauty product reviews, please [...]</li>
    <li> I could not stand the smell of coco butter so, I searched for a product that would provide the same benefits w/o the stench. It is not a cream, but more of a firm ointment. The fragrance of this waxy-ointment is very pleasant. It is greasy...which is good for my dry skin. I love it! We shall see how it works at preventing crazy stretch marks.</li>
    <li> The product smells nice. It didn&#x27;t melt my skin off and cause me to go to the hospital. I did notice a slight reaction to it though and had to stop using it. It might just be sensitive skin due to pregnancy, but I&#x27;m not typically very sensitive to these types of products. The consistency was waxy and it took some rubbing in the palms to get it manageable. For the price, I would have liked a better consistency and absorption. I have found more similar products that cost less but have these qualities.</li>
    <li> This has a thick consistency, so it kind of looks like wax, but you can run your fingers over it in the container and get a thin coating on them to rub into your skin.  It&#x27;s slightly sticky.  The aroma is light and not too strong to upset my super-sensitive morning-sickness nose.  It smells a bit like honey and flowers. I will probably use a more lotion-textured product for easier, quicker, and less-sticky coverage more often (especially in the morning when I&#x27;m in a hurry to get dressed after the shower), but will still use this product occasionally or on particularly dry or itchy spots as it seems very luxurious and natural.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine if it will prevent stretch marks but it seems like it will keep the skin moist.  It has that emollient effect so it seems to sit in a shiny, thin layer on top of the skin.</li>
    <li> The product has a nice, light scent.  It&#x27;s a bit sticky, but it coats my tummy, which is what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I haven&#x27;t had a stretch mark yet and I&#x27;m just at 28 weeks.</li>
    <li> I felt like this product was way too greasy in feel and texture (feels just like vasaline). I have to wear a loose shirt or dress after I apply this butter because if not, my clothes are suctioned to my belly and later I have to wash out the oil stains to prevent permanent damage to my clothing. Other than that, I think it probably does work well; time will tell at the end of my pregnancy I suppose.</li>
    <li> I bought the original TUMMY HONEY BUTTER for my first pregnancy and it was really an answer to my prayers. This was in 2008, this time I purchased it again hoping that the product is the same as the original one but not! This new product has a different scent and the quality of the butter is more let&#x27;s say, less \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than the previous one who literally smells and feels like honey, I really loved the previous product, I still have some of it and still enjoy it. I wonder if they still sell the original product somewhere, I need to do the research now. I will use this one I bought, but sure there is a difference between both butters. What the heck with this new people, can&#x27;t they tell the previous formula is better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 11weeks into my pregnancy but so far so good. I like the texture and scent much more than the pregnancy lotion or butter you can buy at your general supermarket.</li>
    <li> I started using this every night at approximately 15wks. I&#x27;m not due for a few more months so only time will tell if it makes a difference in stretch marks or itching. I agree with the other reviewers who found it to be very thick, greasy and somewhat gritty. This is why I&#x27;m only using it at night. Although it probably rubs off onto my pajamas, it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems and seems to wash off fine. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it during the day or under anything you couldn&#x27;t throw in the washer. That being said, I do like that I still feel it on my stomach when I wake up in the morning and the smell is fine. Also, a little goes a long way and I expect this tub to last at least 3-4 months. Not sure yet if I&#x27;ll buy this again when it runs out or if I&#x27;ll try out a similar product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a couple of months back.  I purchased 2 containers, the first one was good just like how I remembered it to be when I used it with my daughter 3 years ago.  when I opened up the 2nd container a few days ago I noticed that its very grainy....seems like it was sitting for a while and is old or something.  I am still using it since I already paid for it, but I am not happy with this item at this time.....</li>
    <li> I used this product throughout my first two pregnancies. It helped prevent stretch marks. I am now pregnant with my third child and in my third trimester and still no stretch marks! This Tummy Honey is amazing! There are a lot of products on the market but I don&#x27;t believe any of them can compete with Bella B&#x27;s Tummy Honey! It also helps with an itchy belly and on days when I really feel my stomach stretching this helps to bring relief to my skin!</li>
    <li> I started using this stuff as soon as I found out I was pregnant. I know they say stretch marks are hereditary, so I was FULLY prepared to get them since every single mother on both sides of my family have gotten them. Well, I&#x27;m happy to report that I am 2 weeks away from having our first baby, and NOT ONE stretch mark! I fully believe it is because of this tummy butter. I put it on once every night and one tub lasts me about a month. It is vasoline like consistancy, but it does eventually soak in (overnight)....some people don&#x27;t like that, but to me it was a small price to pay if it worked! I will buy this stuff for all of my pregnancies from now on!</li>
    <li> Great product, no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for approx. 2-3 months. Great product. Has a nice smell, is light under clothing and eases scratching instantly. As compared to Bio-Oil, Tummy Butter is by far better.</li>
    <li> I have tried 4 different products; I like one of the other brand better only because it feels less greasy. However I continued to use this product because other than the greasy feel, it works wonders, smells soothing and costs 3times cheaper.  The texture, smell are great, once on, I can rub it into my skin gently spread it out with ease. I found this butter to be better than other stuff costing much more. And the packaging makes it easy to use without wasting compred to products in tubes.    Update 1/11/2011: I&#x27;m 13 days away from my due date, I started to have stretch marks along the lower left side of my belly. I use this product about 2~3 times a day, so I&#x27;m not sure if the product really works or not. I will continue using it even after birth to see if it will make those stretchmarks go away. I will take away another star as it currently did not prevent all my stretchmarks.    Update 1/15/2011: I recently received 2 bottles of of honey butter, one is the same as usual with smooth creamy texture, but the other have a less creamy and sandy rough texture. I returned that one easily thought Amazon, but I now understand what other reviewers said about the particle/sand/rough feeling of the product. Apparently the texture of this butter will be modifier depending on how it was handled or stored. So return it if you receive such a product.    Update 4/18/2011: I reduced the rating to 1 star, because after regular and persistant use from pregency and continues use for 3 month after pregency, I still end up with stretch marks all around my waist and belly. Therefore making me believe this product does not work as advertised. I advise you to try something else for strechmark prevension.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still currently using this one but I&#x27;m in love with it :) right now I don&#x27;t have any signs of stretch marks but I can&#x27;t tell I won&#x27;t have them until my baby is born and until I&#x27;m back with my original shape. But I love the smell of this it&#x27;s not strong and it&#x27;s not irritating to my nose unlike others ...it&#x27;s not that sticky as well so I can just put my clothes on. They said stretch marks are hereditary and my mom got some, but I always believe prevention is better than cure :))) i&#x27;ll be posting a review again next year once my baby is born and i&#x27;m back on my shape for an update :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My belly gets so itchy during pregnancy, and this body butter soothes the itching so well.  It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t make my nausea flare up.  I used it regularly during my last pregnancy and I think it prevented me from getting any stretchmarks at all.  They say stretchmarks are genetic, and both my mom and sister have horrific stretchmarks all over their abdomen and thighs.  Using this body butter, I seem to have cheated fate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked at a Health Foods Store for a year and got to sample many different Stretchmark Creams and this one was my favorite during pregnancy (the Bella B Fading Repair Cream was my favorite for postpartum).</li>
    <li> Thanks! This was a great item!</li>
    <li> Good product, love the smell becuase it&#x27;s not very strong.  A little on the greasy side, but not sticky like other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Not only does this cream help with the itchy belly, but it smells great! I put it on nightly and have yet to see stretch marks. I am 8 months and put it on religiously and the smell is relax and it really helps me from itching my belly. Love it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure if it was this tummy butter, good genes, or not gaining a ton of weight (likely it was a combo of all 3), but I made it through my first pregnancy with ZERO stretch marks.  ZERO!  My husband was neurotic about lubing up my belly at night.  He used a generous amount of butter to cover every inch of belly, lower back, and breasts. I will say, I felt like a buttered turkey but it was well worth it! I started using this about half way through the pregnancy when my belly started growing.  I didn&#x27;t have any itching as many women do as their stomach grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that some jars (I used 3 or 4 during pregnancy) had more grit than others but it was not enough to bother me.  Highly recommend this product to all of my expecting friends!</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I read rave reviews from a bunch of celebrity Moms. I had been using Dancing Dingo&#x27;s Tummy Butter. This product doesn&#x27;t compare at all... it&#x27;s super greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long. I think part of the problem is that since it&#x27;s greasy, it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin very fast and it ends up on your clothes.     I&#x27;ll stick with Dancing Dingo.</li>
    <li> Ok so the second I found out i was pregnant I did my research for the right cream/lotion to prevent stretch marks. Even after reading and hearing advice of doctors and experts stating that there is not a product available to prevent them, I still went ahead and purchase this product mainly because of the reviews. I truly believed what this product promised.     The results: I started using this product on my 2nd month of pregnancy, I applied it 3x a day everyday without a miss. I applied ample butter every time until the day I delivered. So I had my baby 2 weeks ago (3 weeks early) and I have to say the cream did not work. I got many stretch marks, if I had not delivered 3 weeks early, I most likely wold have ended with more. One thing it did do was keep my skin soft and itch free, but that&#x27;s it!     My conclusion: If you are meant to get stretch marks, you&#x27;re are going to get them. I agree with the experts, there is no prevention. Would I have listened to them, I would not have spend over $300 on this product. At least I can say I did what I thought was the best I would do to prevent them. Also, the second I say my baby, the last thing on my mind was stretch marks. Now when I do see my marks, I smile because it reminds me of my beautiful baby, every single mark was worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It is silky smooth and makes my skin so soft.  I&#x27;m 31 weeks pregnant and don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark!  I do still have some itchiness, but I can&#x27;t imagine how itchy I would be without using this.  I also love that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain lanolin or parabens. In terms of greasiness, it is thicker and greasier than a normal body lotion, and it doesn&#x27;t rub in completely, but this makes me feel like it&#x27;s staying on my skin and working.  My work around for this is simply to wear a light cami or undershirt under my normal top.</li>
    <li> I have used this product through 2 pregnancies and so far...no stretch marks! It is really thick and waxy, so it stays on and relieves an itchy belly. I put it on at night before I go to bed, because sometimes it is not comfortable to wear under regular clothes during the day (because it is so thick.) I like that the ingredients are mostly natural and doesn&#x27;t seems to have too many chemicals. It smells nice too!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It saved my belly!  I know that this creme actually was the reason for my lack of stretch marks because I did get marks in the places where I didn&#x27;t put it (my breasts and hips), which stretched far less and much slower than my belly. I put it on once a day beginning in my second trimester, then twice a day in my third trimester.&lt;br /&gt;It helps so much with the itching.  I ran out on day in my third trimester and went wild with itching until I got the next container. Over my 2nd and 3rd trimester I used up 4 of these things.&lt;br /&gt;Also,  this stuff smells wonderful.  The smell is kind of light and floral instead of that normal stretch mark creme coco butter scent. There are many herbs and extracts in this stuff that presumably make it smell so natrual and refreshing. It feels nice on (compared to other similiar products), and is soft and easy to apply. It does not stain clothing as one product I tried did.&lt;br /&gt;One thing buyers should be warned about, in case it is something bothersome for certain people is that this stuff is very hard to get off your hands after applying it.  Soap doesn&#x27;t do it, there is still a residue even after a vigorous washing.  I used dish soap and a rough sponge because the residue from my hands used to get on my hair and make it have a strange sticky texture.  I guess this texture and relative water-proofness is what is necessary to make a product that works so well!!</li>
    <li> it is great. light scent. alleviates itching. makes skin really soft. just bought my 4th tub. i wish they made it in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> I like this product overall, but it leaves my belly tacky to the touch. I find that it doesn&#x27;t absorb and remains &#x27;sticky&#x27; until I shower. I personally don&#x27;t mind it, although my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like my \\&quot;sticky belly\\&quot;. All in all, it&#x27;s probably what makes the product effective, however, I&#x27;m shopping for alternatives that leave my skin more supple and soft instead of feeling like it has a thin layer of glue stick that hasn&#x27;t dried.  I have to totally disagree with how \\&quot;strong\\&quot; the scent is. It says lightly scented, and it absolutely is. I would say this type of product comes down to personal preference - and although its not for me, I would still recommend it based on its effectiveness. I would just note the consistency, and the fact I feel like I have to wash my hands before I touch my face or anything else after I apply it.</li>
    <li> Alright ladies, I know its more expensive than the usual stretch mark cream you find at walmart, but who can put a price on beautiful skin after having a child?? this stuff saved my life, I have 7 stretch marks from before I started using the belly butter and havent gotten one since, and Im now 36 weeks!!! I love it most of all because its not greasy and wont ruin your clothes, it has a very light smell of honey which wouldnt bother any pregnant woman, and the best thing of all is it lasts all day! you can put it on in the morning and still feel it on your skin when you are getting ready for bed! That is probably why it works so well! Ive used the palmers, and that stuff is like rubbing elmers glue on you and then your stomach is dried out an hour later, with this product you will never have this problem. I wish I would have known about it before I started growing! I actually got samples of the product when I oredered pregnancy shirts from [...].... By the way they have awesome shirts that are worth the money! Light, long, and comfy! Hope this helps all you other pregnant woman! Buy this product! You wont regret it...</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few month ago and just recently bought my third order of it.  I am 7 month pregnant and have yet to see any stretch lines.  Iknow its still early but I feel this product is good.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smells which is good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this at the beginning of my 2nd trimester--before I really even needed it. My tummy was still relatively small and not itchy at all. So, at first, I wasn&#x27;t into it--it seemed very thick and sticky. I began to look around for other products and had some luck with Burt Bees&#x27;s Mama Bee Nourishing Body Oil--sometimes I&#x27;d even use Palmer&#x27;s pure cocoa butter stick. However.... when my stomach began to grow and itch at the end of the 2nd trimester-3rd trimester this was the ONLY product that worked. It alleviated the itchiness and kept my skin supple for much much much longer than anything else I tried. The only thing that I tried that really made my skin feel like it had a chance against warding off stretchmarks. Yes, it can be a bit sticky in the way vaseline could make your skin sticky when first applied (which, by the way, this product has no petroleum and is paraben free) it is WELL worth it and the initial \\&quot;stickiness\\&quot; really only lasts for a short bit of time and then your skin feels so so much better. The other thing I should comment on is the fragrance..it has a light natural honey/waxy/flower smell. I really can&#x27;t describe it. I don&#x27;t love it--but it&#x27;s completely bearable and not unpleasant. Bottom line: If you order it and don&#x27;t like it at first--break it out at the 3rd trimester--you may change your mind!! I really could not have lived without it--it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and I noticed that when I used it consistently (2x/day), I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I got pregnant and used it regularly for the past 9 + months. I gave birth last week @ 41 weeks + pregnant and gaining about 35 lbs and one week postpartum - not a stretch mark in sight. Further, the only stretch marks I have are from when I was a teenager and got hips, so I am prone to them. My family is prone to stretch marks, one of my sisters got major zebra stretch marks and so did my mom.   I liked the scent of this and I would use it when I got out of the shower. I would sometimes use it when I got itchy in the summer. I used about 3 jars throughout my pregnancy - with the last trimester being the most. My one issue with this is that it is greasy and frankly ruined a few maternity tops especially as I got bigger. It would not wash away. Definitely noticeable with a summer pregnancy. People thought I was sweating through my belly. And it was a hot summer so it was hard to layer. However, small price to pay as far as I am concerned. I would still recommend it however, because it works!</li>
    <li> Both my mother and my sister have stretch marks and I was told that most likely I would have them too. I am also an \\&quot;older\\&quot; mother. When a friend of mine who was very petite and had a large baby raved about this butter (she had no stretch marks), I had to try it. What did I have to lose. LOVED IT! It&#x27;s a little greasy but it stayed on all day and I wore a little stretchy undershirt/tank top (motherhood maternity)under all my clothes so nothing would get on them. It really didn&#x27;t bother me - I liked the feeling it was on my skin. The BEST part is after two pregnancies and using it religiously - NO STRETCH MARKS! I have defied genetics. So, thank you Tummy Honey Butter - I will recommend it to everyone - and I have!</li>
    <li> Great product. I used it every day from 12 weeks gestation til birth &amp; did not get a single stretch mark. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> 36 weeks pregnant, so far-so GOOD!!!! Great light scent, organic ingredients, great great great! I highly recommend this product to all you pregnant women out there!  It&#x27;s a great gift idea too, it&#x27;s always nice for the momma to get a little something along with baby! :)</li>
    <li> I used this throughout my whole pregnancy. I started using it around 8 weeks and used it morning and night, EVERY night. It does stay on you for many hours and I&#x27;ve heard that some people don&#x27;t like that, but honestly, that&#x27;s what makes it work and worth it as far as I&#x27;m concerned. My skin on my belly stayed extremely moisturized and it never itched. The smell is mild and now that my baby is here, the scent reminds me of pregnancy memories. :) I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks. I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s because of this, but this definitely helped and gave me a great regimen. Either way, it&#x27;s soothing and keeps the itches away. I will recommend this time and time again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month and I don&#x27;t think there are any new stretch marks, but I&#x27;m not sure if its helping my older ones like some of the other reviews have said.  I use it about twice a day.  Also its almost over, so I&#x27;m guessing its good for about 2</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, based on the multitude of nice reviews. She used it for a month, then developed a rash, which resolved with discontinuing the cream. Now using a calendula cream as thick, oily and very slowly to non-absorbable as the Bella B honey butter, and she has no problems. I guess it was a reaction not necessary related to the thickness of the cream as another reviewer suggested (heat rash), but rather to the ingredients (allergy?).    3 stars for nice smell, consistency, felt good until developed rash. I guess if you are not allergic to it, it&#x27;s a great cream.    Update: I didn&#x27;t even see that there is another review from today on the same subject :) I guess my wife is not the only one with an itchy belly due to this cream. They must be doing something wrong with the formula; I&#x27;ll use it on my cracked heels and see what happens.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would keep me from getting stretch marks but unfortunately I ended up with a few. I didn&#x27;t use this product everyday because it left my tummy feeling really greasy and I was worried it would ruin my clothes. It smells ok and who knows if I didn&#x27;t use it at all I might have ended up with a lot more stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. I&#x27;ve tried others that I didn&#x27;t like the consistency or smell, this has a light scent and rubs on very easy. Last pregnancy I used a Burt&#x27;s Bees balm which is now discontinued. I like the balms instead of creams. I&#x27;ll be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. At first I thought it was a bit greasy when you put it on, but it dries quickly and leaves my skin super smooth. I started using it when I was 14 weeks pregnant and now I&#x27;m 32 weeks without a single mark and super soft skin. I have no idea if it&#x27;s prevented the stretch marks (I&#x27;m a FTM), but I know it&#x27;s the reason why my skin feels so nice. I think consistency is key. Since 20 weeks I put it on every morning and every night. I&#x27;m planning on trying the other Bella B products to see if they&#x27;re just as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Just wanted to say that I&#x27;m pregnant again and plan on using this product once more. Hope it works just as great the second time around. I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark!</li>
    <li> Best butter for your belly!!!</li>
    <li> The texture and feel of this stuff drives me crazy.  I thought I could stand it enough to just wear it at bedtime.  I can&#x27;t! It&#x27;s the greasiest feeling stuff I&#x27;ve used yet and I hate that I can&#x27;t even use up what I have left.</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have tried!!  It smells very good and doesn&#x27;t have any nasty ingredients.  I got a sample with an order and fell in love.  I also tried the cream, which is fine, but if you really need moisture this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> Used from the time I had a positive pregnancy test; did not get a single stretch mark!! I also loved the smell. It is super greasy, so you&#x27;ll need to wear a tank to protect your clothes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going through my second pregnancy right now. With my first pregnancy, I was getting stretch marks starting at 5 months and I got them bad. I read that they are linked to your genes, so if you are supposed to get them, you pretty much can only minimize them, not totally avoid them. Well, this pregnancy, I decided that I was still going to fight them. I&#x27;ve been using the Honey Butter religiously since 4 months, and now, in my eighth month of my pregnancy, I am still stretch mark free. I have gained about the same amount of weight as with my first pregnancy, so I attribute my nice white belly completely to this product.    I still have a month to go, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin feels very soft and supple. This also helps tremendously with the itching that comes with your belly stretching. I can see how some people think it&#x27;s greasy. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily describe it as greasy, it&#x27;s more that it just isn&#x27;t going to completely soak into your skin and feel like you need to put more on. I put it on in the morning and when I get home, my skin still feels like I just put lotion on. I like this because I don&#x27;t want to feel like I have to reapply it constantly. I have only been putting it on in the morning, not twice a day. Also, at first I thought it was a little pricey, but I&#x27;m in my third trimester and just broke into my third jar of this. So, three jars for my whole pregnancy... totally worth it! I also love that it is made of all natural products.    The only thing you have to be careful for is that you might not want to use white undergarments with this. It will leave a slight yellowing. This is no big deal to me, as I&#x27;m hoping not to be wearing my granny panties after the pregnancy. I would completely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My mom had terrible stretch marks in both of her pregnancies. I have many, inside my legs, under my arms, knees, all from growing up, even in my back at the waist. So far I only spotted 2 light red lines on the sides of my belly, but I&#x27;m already 32 weeks pregnant, and I only got them now. I&#x27;ve been using this cream since I was about 15 weeks pregnant. I switched from the regular Cocoa butter that we find in grocery stores.&lt;br /&gt;I apply once a day religiously, and sometimes twice a day. The problem is that the texture it is very oily and sticky, and I live in FL, and we are in June, so it is hard to walk around during the day all sweaty and oily. But I do try. It is helping another problem that I have, a dry spot on the top of my belly, and my bra is leaving terrible red marks on my belly. So, when I use the cream under my bra it helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;After I give birth I&#x27;ll give another review and let you all know how it helped me.&lt;br /&gt;Crossing my fingers.</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizing and really helps with itching too!</li>
    <li> I use this butter religiously!!! It smells great and allows my tummy to be moisturized for the entire day. I&#x27;m crossing my fingers on NOT getting stretch marks by the end of my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> So far I love this product keeps my belly moist</li>
    <li> 8 months in to my pregnancy I ordered this, I had been using other products (other, much less expensive products).  About 4 days after using it, I got my first stretch mark.  I used it more!  After I had a whole striped pattern on my lower abdomen, I ordered my original product.  I kept using the Bella B until it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using my previous stuff, cocco butter with vitamin E (like 5 dollars for 8 ounces), I haven&#x27;t gotten any- not one more stretch mark- and don&#x27;t think my belly hasn&#x27;t grown in the last month.  I&#x27;m 9 1/2 months now and with the cocco butter, my current marks are already looking better.&lt;br /&gt;So, not only does it not work, but it was horrible to use.  It is like a tub of car wax.  It sets on the skin, doesn&#x27;t absorb, sticks to your clothes.  My husband wouldn&#x27;t rub it on me because he HATED how it was on his hands!  (he rubs the cocco butter on me gladly).&lt;br /&gt;I know that every body and pregnancy is different, but I can&#x27;t believe all the good reviews this product has.  I don&#x27;t understand it.  The only thing I can figure is people get mesmorized by the cute packaging and hype on the label.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, save your time, save your dermis!  If ANYTHING actually helps with stretch marks, this product is NOT it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good (like perfume) and feels pretty good on my skin, but it&#x27;s a little sticky (the consistency is kind of like soft chapstick). I don&#x27;t use it as much as I use other products because there are little bits of grittiness in the tub I got, which I&#x27;ve seen others complain about. I also do experience some light itchiness after I put it on and then put on my clothing.</li>
    <li> NEW:&lt;br /&gt;So I have completed my pregnancy. I topped out at 44 inches around my waist. I went from 142 pounds to 176 pounds. I used this product every single morning. And NO STRETCH MARKS! I could not be more satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD:&lt;br /&gt;I am 4 months pregnant and am experiencing an itchy tummy. I researched a number of sites on the internet to try to come up with the best solution. Most sites pointed to Bella B Tummy Honey Butter. So I bought the product. Received it in a VERY timely manner and started using it last week. My stomach is no longer itchy at all. It almost creates this tingly sensation when you apply it. Afterwards, my tummy is smoothe and moisturized. Loving the product so far. Hopefully it alleviates stretch marks too! We will see...</li>
    <li> Love it. Arrived fast!!  My husband rubs it on my belly every night!!  Would buy again.  The smell is pretty faint.</li>
    <li> This is really one of the best products that I own.  It&#x27;s fantastic for much more than stretch mark prevention.  In my home we use it whenever someone has dry or chapped skin.  It seal in moisture and works really well.  My daughter tends to get itchy when she&#x27;s hot so when she wears her footed fleece pj&#x27;s to bed I rub some of this on the back of her legs and hips and she doesn&#x27;t scratch at them.  Before she&#x27;d wake up in the morning looking like a cat got ahold of her.  It really is great for preventing stretch marks and helping out with that itchy pregnant belly thing we get.  My fav thing about it was how when my c-section scar would start to feel stretched from this pregnancy and itchy I would apply this stuff and it would instantly go away.  No more itch, no more pulling feeling.  Great product with many uses.  Smell is very light.  To me it almost smells like a very diluted Clinique Happy.</li>
    <li> I am 31 weeks pregnant and my belly is huge! I use this everyday and so far no stretch marks. Although, if I get a few it wont be the end of the world. It doesn&#x27;t make me itch and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation associated with it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the best things I bought myself for my pregnancy.  I first tried palmer&#x27;s coco-butter, but my sensitive skin broke out in a rash.  Then a nurse-friend of mine recommended this one.  I thought that $20 price tag for a jar was a bit steep (but of course I found it cheaper here on Amazon), but actually it turned out to be a great deal since the 4 oz jar lasts and lasts! You only need 1 jar to last you through the whole pregnancy (at least for me and for my friend).  Plus it feels  and smells great, and I love that all the ingredients are natural!  I use this everyday and it definitely helps to relieve the skin tightness as the belly grows.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping to prevent stretch marks or not, but so far, I think it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> This is the only brand/type of tummy butter my husband likes. It smells great and goes on easily! Love it!</li>
    <li> I REALLY REALLY REALLY like this product. With my first pregnancy, I used Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter---which I thought it worked in a way I expected. I thought it is not preventable to have itchy skin during pregnancy. Toward the end of pregnancy, I suffered with itchy skin and stretch marks.  With my second pregnancy, my friend gave me this product, and it went beyond my expectation!!! I did not have to deal with itchy skin!!! This was amazing!!! When the cream was all gone, I briefly used Burt Bee&#x27;s tummy cream too since it was something I could get from a local store----and---yes, I had itchy skin, and got stretch marks from just 1 week of the use. After this experience, I ordered Bella B Tummy Honey Butter by Amazon.com, and itchy skin was gone again!!!! If I become pregnant again,  I&#x27;ll use it for sure!!!!!!! Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> I am about 7 months pregnant and have been using this stuff religiously since about 9 weeks.  I followed the directions and applied it every night and every morning, especially after I showered.  I still, somehow, got stretchmarks.  They showed up at about week 27 and have been getting progressively worse.  The product claims to reduce the appearance of stretchmarks, but no such luck yet.    I also itch a LOT.  This is my first pregnancy; so, I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  However, I feel like scratching my stomach MANY times a day.  Even right after application sometimes.      I also had little red bumps show up, that itch, all over my stomach.  But, I&#x27;ve read that this could be a common pregnancy symptom and may not have anything to do with the product.    On the positive side, I am still using this product.  My mother and sister had horrible stretchmarks (which is why I was trying to prepare) and they claim that mine aren&#x27;t as bad.  So, perhaps the product helped a little.  I am not willing to take the chance of not using it and them getting even worse.</li>
    <li> I used this during my first pregnancy and when I first used it, I loved the aroma.  But as my pregnancy progressed, the smell was entirely too strong for me to handle.  Even my husband said it was strong, but he thought it was still pleasant smelling.  I didn&#x27;t care much for the texture of the butter, it was slightly tacky, but I never had any problems with it ruining my clothes.  And I don&#x27;t know if maybe I wasn&#x27;t using enough (I tried to continue using it even with the strong aroma), but I still got plenty of stretch marks.  It just felt as though it wasn&#x27;t absorbing enough to soften my skin for stretching.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. Too sticky and tacky. It stuck to everything I wore to bed. It also had a gritty texture to it. I do not plan on buying this product again. The Mama Mio Tummy butter is much better.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! Smells great…almost slightly lemony, but not at all overwhelming. Feels so much better than other creams out there for pregnant mamas. It takes a little while to really soak in though, so plan on not getting dressed RIGHT away after applying it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product in my 6th and 7th month.  So far I am loving it.  2 more months and I will know if it really stood the test of time.</li>
    <li> I used Bella B Tummy Honey Butter with my first pregnancy and had no stretch marks. I started using it early on in my second pregnancy and I&#x27;m hoping for the same results. I hate the smell of everything when I&#x27;m pregnant, but this Tummy Honey has a mild scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I&#x27;m glad to be using it again!</li>
    <li> I put it on at night only cuz I don&#x27;t like the way it feels under my clothing but other than that...I love it! My stretch marks are slowly disappearing.</li>
    <li> this butter really works, very very very very very very very very very very very good. Use is from the very beginning and use enough butter every time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa butter for 6 months, and never really liked the vanilla scent, so I thought about switching to Honey.  Bella B sounded like a good product and had good reviews.  So last night I tried it.  This morning I woke up with 3 big stretch marks spanning my entire stomach.  I was horrified.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything!  Then I went back to the reviews and noticed that the best reviews are basically from a long time ago, before the company was acquired, and apparently they changed the formula.  Buyer Beware!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation to prevent stretch marks after my first trimester of pregnancy. I&#x27;ve used it for the past 3 months almost every night and have not had any stretch marks yet. I have yet to hit the fast growing 3rd trimester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging says organic and promotes the cocoa, shea, and aloe vera ingredients. The top ingredient on the list is aloe vera followed by a long list of other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is buttery with a little bit of graininess which I&#x27;m not sure is intentional or not. The packaging claims to not feel greasy, but it feels pretty greasy. It will get on the inside of your clothes so beware of that. I just put it on before bed so it&#x27;s not a big deal. But you can definitely still feel a bit of residue on your skin even the next day. There is a bit of a scent but it&#x27;s pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the texture, so far I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks, whether it is because of the Bella B Tummy Honey Butter, I can&#x27;t say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full review with video and photos here:[...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since the very beginning of my pregnancy and I&#x27;m now 37 weeks along. I was worried that it might stain my clothes, but it hasn&#x27;t at all! Its very light, and keeps my skin moisturized literally all day long (unlike most other lotions/creams). I got some stretch marks during my first pregnancy but haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones this time around....of course you won&#x27;t really know until the skin isn&#x27;t stretched. It has a nice light scent. I used one container about every 2 months in the beginning and now that my belly is huge I use about 1 container per month. I love this product!</li>
    <li> So far it is working great, and it smells wonderful.  Much better alternative to the stinky cocoa butter that I have been using.</li>
    <li> I used this a couple of times during my pregnancy and fealt more itchey and ended up with a rash. I swithced to cocoa butter and had better results. I triend it again and ended up with a rash again. Now that I&#x27;m no longer pregnant I tried it again and it just made my skin dry and itchy. Don&#x27;t wast your money!!!</li>
    <li> I started using this with my first pregnancy at about 12 weeks and was so happy with the product I used it with my second pregnancy also. Some people say that getting stretch marks is genetic and that if you have the genes to get them there is nothing you can do to prevent it. This is not true. I have stretch marks from growing during adolescence and also got some small stretch marks during my first pregnancy in places I didn&#x27;t use the honey butter. My only complaint about the product is that it does leave your skin feeling kind of sticky but I&#x27;m sure there is no way to get around that since the product works by keeping all layers of your skin moist. I also believe the success of the product is dependent upon consistency in use. I applied it 2 times a day, every day and never got any stretch marks where I used it. I used about 4 tubs of tummy honey butter for each pregnancy and feel it was totally worth the investment. I plan on using it again for my 3rd.</li>
    <li> I used this with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.  I am 27 weeks pregnant with baby #2 and still no stretch marks.  We&#x27;ll see how I&#x27;m looking after the baby is born!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 years after my second baby and I have very very faint stretch marks in my lower tummy area. I still wear a bikini and I think they&#x27;re really only noticeable to me. I recommend this for every pregnant woman!! Don&#x27;t forget to apply to your breasts! That&#x27;s where I got most of my stretch marks, but that&#x27;s what happens when you go from a C to a DD in a matter of months.</li>
    <li> I am 5 months pregnant and I have been using this item for more than a month. Just before using it, my stretch marks began appearing although I was using some other moisturizer. After Bella B, I have never seen a new mark on my tummy. I am really happy with it. My most important concern is that it is very oily and makes me a little uncomfortable. Also, I need to apply it twice on some days to prevent itchiness and red marks.</li>
    <li> Absolute waste of money. It is soooo sticky that you will never want to put it again. It will spoil all your clothes. Please don&#x27;t buy this. Instead you can try Palmers.</li>
    <li> First things first a little background.. My mom and sisters did not get stretch marks during their pregnancies and did not use any special creams except good ole lotion while pregnant. Being a petite woman my mom gained around 50 pounds with all pregnancies and still no stretch marks!! I am petite at 100 pounds prepregnancy weight. I do not scratch my skin when it itches, I exercise everyday (modified Turbo Fire and occasional running with the hubby to be exact) and have only gained 22 pounds with my pregnancy thus far at 39 weeks. Now onto the review :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product from the time I started trying to get pregnant and am still using it at 39 weeks pregnant. I apply the product 2 sometimes 3 times a day RELIGIOUSLY and I started noticing stretch marks around 37 weeks.  They are not awful stretchmarks but alas still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I would not buy this product if you are looking for a cream to prevent stretchmarks. Although I must say it does wonders for the itching and makes my skin feel lovely after I put it on. I wish it would have prevented the stretch marks but I guess I will learn to embrass them for what they are. Hope this review helps!!</li>
    <li> I love this butter--it smells amazing, is smooth and thick, and has truly made my skin feel less tight while stretching through pregnancy. I use it 2x a day and really cannot get enough of it...I have used a few other brands of belly balms and creams...nothing compares to Bella B Tummy Honey Butter! Love it!</li>
    <li> I thought this product was great at first, it smelled great and used mostly natural ingredients compared to other creams, but upon continued use I just noticed it would make my skin really itchy and dry.  Which is surprising because the container states that it is hypoallergenic and has an Anti-itch Formula.  It wasn&#x27;t moisturizing or anti- itching at all!</li>
    <li> If your belly or skin gets rashes when it&#x27;s oily or overheat with clothes covered, I wouldn not recommend this product. This product, as it mentioned on the lable, would not absorb, so it stayed oily and sticky on my belly. After covered by clothes for a day or two, my belly broke out reashes all over.    It smells good though.</li>
    <li> Wife used this during her first pregnancy and it worked overall pretty well. The smell isn&#x27;t fantastic but it&#x27;s not bad either. I would suggest doing research and seeing what works for everyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this b/c I heard it would help prevent stretch marks during pregnancy.  It didn&#x27;t work for me - still got them :(</li>
    <li> I used the butter with both of my pregnancies and did&#x27;nt get any marks at all!! In fact, little white growth marks on my legs from high school disappeared!  I would recommend this to everyone who is pregnant!  Plus my husband loved the smell of it too!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks and I&#x27;m 33+ weeks along, so it&#x27;s really good for that. I give it 4 stars because of the itchiness.</li>
    <li> Smells good  however, leaves u with a dry chapped feeling does not leave you with a smooth silky feeling</li>
    <li> I got bella b tummy honey butter and lotion as gifts from my girl friends, since she has nice experience with using these products, so do I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start to use it from my first trimester, almost everyday. now is one month after my labor. my tummy looks so clear:) no stretch mark, even though, my tummy stretched from 24inches, to 42 inches! it is so&lt;br /&gt;impressive, i&#x27;d like to recommend to all my friend and families!</li>
    <li> My skin broke out in red blotches and itched like crazy after two weeks of using this product.  Had to discontinue use and switched to Eucerin.</li>
    <li> I swear this is the only reason I did not get one single stretch mark the entire pregnancy. I gained 38lbs (started at 113lbs), and I have old stretch marks from puberty. I used this product religiously twice a day all over my body, and I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks AT ALL - AND my baby was over a week late. It really does work. I will use this again in my next pregnancies as well.</li>
    <li> Thank you Nortech for you speedy services and great price. Bella B Tummy Honey Butter was packaged well and brand new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got the product today and have used it once. I can tell you this- I LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF! Also, even though I have just used the product once, my dry hands feel moisturized without that \\&quot;greasy, slippery\\&quot; feeling that other lotions or Vaseline stuff leave. Great job Nortech and Bella B Tummy Honey Butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave only 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t used the PRODUCT enough yet to give it 5.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since I my 2nd month of pregnancy.  It has a very pleasant, light scent that is perfect for pregnancy, even when I had morning sickness.  Its very moisturizing, and completely gets rid of my itchy tummy symptoms.  I especially like all the natural ingrediants in it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few months ago and have been using it atleast 2 to 3 times a day. My belly is soooo itchy that I&#x27;m online right now looking for something else to buy. The tummy butter says anti-itch on it but my belly is itchy! It looks like it will moisturize your skin because it goes on thick and greasy but it doesn&#x27;t even last a few hours. The smell and greasiness does not bother me - I just wanted it to work. I am 7.5 months along now and the itch has gotten progressively worse. I bought it because I am trying to use all natural products and was willing to spend more money. Now I see that it was not worth it since it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> It was a pleasure to use this everyday during my pregnancy.  It is a little thick and a little oily but in a good way.  Although some did occasionally transfer to my clothes, it never stained.  I never got a stretch mark either (not sure if it was the cream or just luck). I highly recommend this and plan to use it again if i needed it again.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that this product will leave grease stains on your clothing if you do not let it dry completely before putting anything on. It takes quite a long time to absorb since it is so thick (probably an hour or so), at least in my experience. I ruined a few cotton tops with this stuff before I figured it out, unfortunately.     I use other stretch mark prevention creams that are not greasy and will not stain in the morning before putting on my clothing. Before bed, I really grease myself up with the tummy honey butter, and I put on a night gown that I have already stained with it (so it doesn&#x27;t matter). I wake up with my skin still feeling soft and smelling wonderful!     I am 28 weeks and have really JUST popped, and I still have 0 stretch marks. I also use it on my breasts, which have grown 3 cup sizes, and I also have no stretch marks there. My mom has horrible stretch marks, and I do expect to get some towards the end. I guess we will see what happens!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I got a few samples of it at my OB&#x27;s office &amp; just had to buy it.  It&#x27;s thick &amp; non-absorbing, like it says.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now.  I&#x27;m 37 weeks &amp; so far no stretch marks.  I love the smell, too.  It&#x27;s hard to find &amp; I was happy to find it on Amazon.  The company I bought if from through Amazon offered free shipping &amp; it took much longer to receive than I&#x27;d imagined.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of amazing reviews of this product before I bought it.  It&#x27;s made by a California company and the ingredients are almost all natural/herbal.  So I thought \\&quot;great, this is the perfect product for me!\\&quot;  Unfortunately, as soon as I opened the jar, I was assaulted by the extremely strong fragrance.  This is a product made almost entirely of herbs of one kind or another, so it would probably be very smelly on its own (in a nice way!), but Bella B thought it would be a good idea to ADD fragrance (listed in the ingredients as \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; -- what does THAT mean?).  It&#x27;s extremely strong-smelling, and the one day I tried it I had a headache all day from the fumes.  Just awful.  I am so disappointed that a product made almost entirely of natural ingredients would have such a strong unnatural fragrance added.  I will never use this again.  $20 down the drain.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works well, and smells great!</li>
    <li> I LOVED this Tummy Butter when I was pregnant with my little baby, so I ordered it again when we got pregnant with our 2nd. But now when I put it on at night it seems to be extra grainy and won&#x27;t absorb. It also gave me a rash (I figured maybe skin was just irritated at first), and most of all has made me ITCHY. I couldn&#x27;t believe it was doing exactly what it is supposed to prevent, and couldn&#x27;t figure out why it doesn&#x27;t seem to be what I thought it was. When I just read the review that states Bella B was bought out and has different ingredients, it all makes sense. So disappointing. Will not re-order or purchase other products from this brand.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this butter going by reviews but I was very disappointed. The rub is oily, I felt like it never really got absobed into the skin. There is also a &#x27;grainy&#x27; consistency to it so hours later I would my tummy still covered in &#x27;bits&#x27; unlike exfoliation rubs where the beads usually absorb. There isn&#x27;t a scent which is great if you don&#x27;t want a scented item but I just felt like I was being lathered in lard!! I have since tried &#x27;Lamaze belly rub&#x27; and definitely recommend that one a hundred times over. It leaves a soft, silky feel to your skin, has a pleasant smell and best of all - no grainy bits!! I used this butter in my 4-5th month of pregnancy. I&#x27;m now in my 7th using the lamaze rub and I&#x27;ll never go back to this Bella B product!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a desperate attempt to prevent further stretch marks during my second pregnancy.  In addition to my stretch marks, my skin was extra dry and itchy so I was hoping this product would do the trick (as it says on the container it \\&quot;soothes itching\\&quot;).  The \\&quot;honey butter\\&quot; felt more like sand paper.  The consistency was petroleum jelly like but very grainy as well.  For that reason, I hated applying it onto my skin.  I would have at least endured through the pain of putting it on my skin if it somewhat helped my condition but it did NOTHING for me.  After a week, I ended up buying the Belli brand instead.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff so far.  I put it on at night because yes it&#x27;s kinda ........ ick under clothes.  I haven&#x27;t hit the end of my pregnancy so I can&#x27;t say about stretch marks.  I can say it sure helps me sleep because my belly isn&#x27;t itchy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an update, I recommend this to anyone pregnant. I have plenty of stretch marks so I&#x27;m not one who never gets them but after two pregnancies using this product I ended up with one two inch mark that showed up the night I was in the hospital in labor with my first. I will always wonder if I&#x27;d brought it with me to the hospital I would have avoided even that one (surely not).I know there are not magic creams that work for everyone but I really believe this helped me.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law had gotten a sample of and gave it to me to try, initially I thought it was way too greasy. (I think I used too much, a little goes a long way!) After the sample was gone my husband bought me some, I used it twice a day until it was gone. Not a huge fan of the $20 price tag, I decided to buy something cheaper at walmart. (Palmer&#x27;s tummy butter...) After 5 days of using that, my belly itches like crazy!! I didn&#x27;t realize how well the anti-itch stuff they put in this works! Now I will be making a special trip to the store to pick up more! Well worth the price, honestly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 18 weeks along and I don&#x27;t really know when stretch marks appear if someone&#x27;s going to get them but so far I don&#x27;t have any. Granted, there&#x27;s not a lot of stretching going on yet.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this product is like a thicker Vaseline but not slick if that makes sense. I feel like it really hydrates my skin and prevents the itchiness of pregnancy. I only give it 4 instead of 5 stars because I usually wash my hands after using it. But I do feel it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I notice a difference in stretch marks and certainly do not feel itchiness any longer. very soothing product. i&#x27;ve re-ordered as well as gifted to friends.</li>
    <li> I am very prone to getting stretch marks and have many already from puberty. I am 31 weeks pregnant and have been using this product since 12 months into my pregnancy. I have no stretch marks on my belly thanks to Bella B Tummy products! Some customers complaint that it is a bit gritty after application. This is indeed the case, so I mix it in a 1:1 ratio with my regular body lotion before application and it evens out fine. I love the gentle fragrance as well. This product really works!</li>
    <li> First pregnancy I used thee over advertised Palmer&#x27;s Butter and it didnt do anything but moisturize. I still got some stretch marks when my son turned head down at 33 weeks and they were ugly dark ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, we are pregnant again and I have been using this. I don&#x27;t have stretch marks, the older ones are gone they are just skin tone color and it moisturizes so well and doesn&#x27;t make the skin itch at all! I love it, it smells wonderful so soft of a smell that it doesn&#x27;t bother you. You dont need much to apply it so it last a while. I think I made the right choice in getting this tub versus the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply twice a day, all natural formula and it&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My daughter used this for two pregnancies (2008 &amp; 2014) and she has no stretch marks. NONE! I would scoff if I didn&#x27; see it for  myself.  Both babies were well over&lt;br /&gt; seven lbs, and she is only 5&#x27;, so she&lt;br /&gt;got pretty big.  She used this early and faithfully, and it worked. I&#x27;d&lt;br /&gt;recommend that approach since it seemed to prepare her skin.</li>
    <li> Really does relieve itching and takes the pain out of the stretching skin. It&#x27;s quite gooey and very thick so, don&#x27;t expect it to come off of your hands immediately. I use mine twice daily and have noticed very little stretch marks. I keep a back up ready to go in case I run out, totally worth the money and effort.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  My girlfriend sent me my first tub of this and I put it on every morning.  I&#x27;m currently 29 weeks pregnant and the only place I have stretch  marks are between my boobs...so ladies don&#x27;t forget to put this amazing stuff there!!  Every other place I have put it...no stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I didn&#x27;t get any strech marks until the last few weeks of my pregnancy and I chalk that up to good genes more than anything. Regardless though the product did keep me from itching my belly as much as my skin tightened and was mostorizing without being to greasy. I am still using the product three weeks after having my baby and the streach marks seem to be fading away. I am now buying the product for my best friend who is pregnant.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works at preventing stretch marks when used faithfully. If you are concerned about greasiness, use it at night then wear an old T-shirt. It will be worth it in the end! I</li>
    <li> I used this twice a day, everyday from about 12 weeks on, and got no stretch marks. The waxy ness of it didn&#x27;t bother me, but you can&#x27;t let it bother you that your shirts will stick to your belly.  This stuff is a must have if you care about stretch marks.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to avoid stretch marks during pregnancy.  It is a bit pricey though and I found that cocoa butter lotion works just as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased based on a recommendation from my SIL.  She indicated she used and she did not get stretch marks.  I can tell it&#x27;s already working well and has cut down on itching.</li>
    <li> Although I believe stretch marks are mostly hereditary, I swear by this stuff! I used it when pregnant the first time and made it through with zero stretch marks! I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for my second pregnancy! I like the natural ingredients and the scent is luxurious! Note to moms: I use this maybe every other night and make sure to wear a cotton t-shirt I don&#x27;t mind getting stained. It&#x27;s pretty thick and gooey, but lasts even through a shower so you don&#x27;t have to use it every night. Doesn&#x27;t get on work clothes the next morning after the shower though. It washes out of the t-shirt, but I just wear an old one to be safe! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Used it with my first pregnancy and prayed daily and had no stretch marks in the end.  Only wish it rubbed in a bit better.  It will get on whatever clothing you sleep in.  It is somewhat greasy and seems to stay on the top of your skin for a bit.</li>
    <li> I picked this up from Amazon because I finally ran out of my Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter.  I have nothing against Palmer&#x27;s except it just doesn&#x27;t smell very good and I was ready to try something new. This stuff smells great! Not surprisingly it smells like honey. Yes, it is a little greasy but it keeps your skin supple and thus allows for your skin to stretch without leaving any stretch marks. I&#x27;m not sure that this would be the ideal pick if you live in a hot, sticky climate but for me it&#x27;s winter right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently 30 weeks and so far no stretch marks at all (I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks). Sure, it could be good genetics but you should see the stretch marks on my sister!!! My waist has gone from 25 inches to 39 inches so I&#x27;m not tiny, I&#x27;ve also put on 25 pounds so far and will probably put on another 5 pounds before all this is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this and the Bella Bee Tummy Honey Cream. Pick the cream if you want something that isn&#x27;t so greasy (but what&#x27;s a little grease if it means no stretch marks?). There are no artificial preservatives and it&#x27;s loaded with natural ingredients. Use it twice a day for optimal results. I can&#x27;t stop raving about this stuff it&#x27;s absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** I am now 34 weeks along, tummy has grown another 2 inches (total inches added now 17) and I&#x27;ve put on another 5 pounds (30 in total so far). Guess what? Still no stretch marks. My fingers are crossed and I&#x27;m still using it twice a day. I&#x27;m also been supplimenting with Bio Oil every other day as my supply is running low of the tummy honey and I&#x27;m not sure where to purchase it in Canada.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I am pregnant with twin babies, and I started using this when I was about 5 months.  I use it for my belly, butt, and thighs.  Even before I got pregnant, I had a little bit of stretch marks around my thigh areas. And after starting to use this product, that even went away (not completely, but clearly thinner). I am about to give birth in the next 2 weeks, and I still don&#x27;t have any stretch marks on my belly.  I will definitely keep using this after the pregnancy too!</li>
    <li> I used the tummy honey butter starting at about 12 weeks, and continued throughout my pregnancy.  As others have said, it did not absorb completely, but that made it help with my second trimester itchiness throughout the day.  I still have the remnants of stretch marks on my breasts from puberty, so I was very worried about getting more from the pregnancy.  I am happy to report that I only ended up with one very small strech mark.  It originated from the small scar I had from an old belly button piercing, so the skin there was already compromised.  All in all, a great product.</li>
    <li> The tummy butter was awesome.  I used it religiously during pregnancy and post postpartum.  My belly remained smooth with no marks.  It also prevented itchiness due to the stretching.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells good, it feels good and it lasts for ever. I put it everywhere. Even my face.</li>
    <li> When I purchased the tummy honey butter, I wanted something to prevent stretch marks on my growing tummy and also to relieve the constant itching I was experiencing. Since using the tummy butter, I haven&#x27;t seen any stretch marks forming and it has helped minimize itching. I love this product!</li>
    <li> This product is very greasy. I only used a small amount and stood in front of a fan for ten minutes hoping it would dry but it did not. I then tried to wipe it off with no success. It got on my clothes making my shirt cling to me and eventual seeped through so you could see grease marks! It was on my hands for a good amount of time too even after I wiped them multiple times-soap &amp; water did nothing to get it off. It no stars were an option that is what I would have rated this product. I am very disappointed and should have listened to the reviews warning it was greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this! 38 weeks pregnant, no marks so far! Only draw back, it does goes fast, I started ordering more than one at a time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this belly butter. It just lathers your skin, goes on smoothly and at first seems a little greasy when you apply it but your skin absorbs it in minutes leaving your belly feeling soft and smelling good too! I used it for my face too (very gentle on skin &amp; no break outs!) and now I still buy it for me and my girls to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for every single time of my 3 pregnancies, and they&#x27;ve worked great! I haven&#x27;t had any stretch marks (and that&#x27;s my pregnancy pet peeve!) during and after pregnancy. But just apply generously! It might feel sticky to some, but to me it just feels like putting petroleum jelly on a dry rash. Stickiness and waxiness comes with the territory I guess. I&#x27;d rather feel waxed-on for a couple of months than have those not-so-pretty stretch marks on my body! Eek!</li>
    <li> I am 8 moths pregnant and so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;If anything will update with a different review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is good, a bit sticky but that is what helps the skin to be elastic.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy it :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I could not find the Burt&#x27;s Bees Belly Butter anywhere.  This product is so greasy...didn&#x27;t even want to get dresses after putting it on!  The Burt&#x27;s Bees product is soooo much better, but can&#x27;t be found anywhere!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the effectiveness of this product because I&#x27;ve been too distracted by its incredible greasiness. Even after letting the product dry for 20 minutes before dressing, the product will leave grease marks on your clothing and cause your skin to stick to the ointment. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> My expectant daughter in law loves this product. This was my second order and, as usual, shipping was ultra fast and the price is right.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Keeps me moisturized throughout the day but does feel pretty greasy when first putting it on.  Despite the oily feeling I haven&#x27;t noticed any stains showing up on my clothing so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice a day throughout my entire pregnancy. I did not get stretch marks until the last 4 weeks. If stretch marks run in your family you are probably going to get them anyway.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Amazon ~3 months ago, when I was 5ms pregnant, after I got my first stretch marks on my chest. I did leave a review shortly after saying something like &#x27;so far so good&#x27;. Well, here is my update. I am now 37.5 wks pregnant and this last weekend I got stretch marks all over my belly. My skin itches and hurts, but of course it is the look that upsets me the most.     So... when reading the reviews be sure to pay attention to those ppl who are in the final stages of their pregnancy, b/c this is when most of the stretch marks tend to appear. I have used the product for 3ms, twice a day, no skipping. It smells fine and it is greasy like every other belly butter that I came across (although all of them claim to be non-greasy). But all of this does not matter if it doesn&#x27;t work. So I guess you can buy and use it - it won&#x27;t hurt you. But it may not help as well.    To those who are interested, I am 5ft7\\&quot;, started out 115lb, and 150 now.. so yes, I did gain 35lb and like they say it is &#x27;all belly&#x27;. I eat very healthy and exercised regularly until 7.5ms pregnant (still do - just not as regularly :)    Anyways, good luck to everyone with this product. It did not work for me, but maybe it will be a better fit for your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I suggest it to all my pregnant friends! I used it faithfully during my 1st pregnancy morning and evening. I was SURE that I would get stretch marks as I had them terribly during those early teen growth spurts but...NONE! I made it through with no stretch marks, and it helped fade the ones on my hips as well. I&#x27;m @ 26wks with my 2nd pregnancy, no stretch marks yet. This stuff helps tremendously with the itching as well. If I forget to put it on in the morning I will be itching terribly by lunch. Buy it!</li>
    <li> While this product smells nice the texture is very grainy. It also does not provide any relief for itching at all. As far as stretch mark prevention I guess it works okay as so far I have not seen any stretch marks on my body and I&#x27;m 5 months along.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works wonders on the skin and it&#x27;s all natural, would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Love Tummy honey butter! Used it for both my pregnancys, smells great!</li>
    <li> I am currently 19 weeks pregnant and have been using this belly butter since about week 8.  I live in a dry climate (esp. in winter) so I need something really moisturizing.  It is thick and a more &#x27;oil based&#x27; consistency (rather than a lotion or creme) - which I like.  I can rub some on my stomach in the morning and it does not feel dry by the end of the day.      I have not had any itchy belly yet and hope not to by using this 2x a day.  I also have VERY sensitive skin and am very sensitive to smells and this product has not irritated either my skin or my nose.    I have tired a few other belly moisturizers but this one has by far been my favorite. I will keep using this for the next 20 weeks!</li>
    <li> I bought it because it had such good reviews. I used this cream diligently through my pregnancy and it didn&#x27;t help a thing. I ended up with nasty stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not pleasant to use either. It smells nicely but it leaves an oily film on your skin which then soaks into your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. Expensive mistake</li>
    <li> I went through three of these tubs and don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark. It&#x27;s either genes or this tummy butter does the trick!</li>
    <li> My niece used this through 2 pregancies gave this good reviews but I&#x27;ll need to let you know in 9 months:-)</li>
    <li> works great!!! so far i dont have any stretch marks, i have 2 more months to go so im hoping this product will do the trick. ive had friends whom used it and swears by it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product through two pregnancies. Three years later, I have zero stretch marks. I believe that is enough proof that it works. It leaves the skin nice and supple for hours. I love the thick formula - perfect for preventing stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing but make sure you don&#x27;t overuse in one application and rub in thoroughly otherwise it will feel greasy.  There is a gritty texture to the body butter as well that provides some exfoliation qualities.</li>
    <li> I have thin skin, prone to stretch marks. I use mama mio oil, add generous amount of bio oil, and after seal the moisture with this belly butter 2times a day. It really works...I have no stretch marks and I&#x27;m almost due.</li>
    <li> I swear by this Bella b brand! I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks from my first pregnancy and am using Bella b now again. However I only gave it 4 stars because I like the one that looks more like a fat glue stick for easy application. I also like the lotion. This is good but I rather not stick my fingers into this when I can use a rub on stick or lotion instead. That being said this product is great I just prefer the other application but this same Bella b brand!</li>
    <li> I used this all throughout my pregnancy and I have no stretch marks. It has a nice light scent. It&#x27;s a little difficult to put on and it helps if you warm it uo in your hands a little. I always put it on at hight for fear of it staining my clothes though I never noticed that happening. It also gives a greasy feeling that I didn&#x27;t want to deal with during the day. Overall a good product though.</li>
    <li> Prevents stretch marks. Fades old stretch marks. Absorbs after 15mins. Thick coating. Smells fresh. Keeps skin soft n supple. Good for hand and nipple cream too.</li>
    <li> I just started using this tummy butter so I cannot tell you wether it will prevent stretch marks or not, but, I can tell you how nice it feels to rub it on your tummy.  I used Palmers Cocoa Butter Stretch Mark Cream for my last pregnancy and it worked but it smelled awful. I went on a search this pregnancy to find something with natural ingredients that didn&#x27;t smell so bad and that wasn&#x27;t a lotion and found this product.  I like the smell of this one, it has a very light scent that is almost undescribable. It almost smells like a candle oil that you would burn or some kind of floral incense.   The formulation is simular to a lip balm and when you put it on it has tiny little beads that exfoliate the skin (which I enjoy).   I reccomend this product. It smells much better than some of the stretch creams that you typically see in drugstors.  It does leave a light greasy feeling to the tummy after application, but it&#x27;s nothing to worry about. Just put a tank top on and your good to go.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a month ago and there are some things I really like and some things not so much.  The texture is really nice: a little grainy to exfoliate (and it feels nice the rub on your itchy belly). Let me tell you though, it definetly does not soak in quickly. It leaves you greasy, and I would recomend wearing a tanktop under your shirt (although it never ruined or left marks on any of my clothes). Also, for me, it really soothed the burning and itching, which sometimes, is all I really care about in a pregnancy lotion. It warms up nicely in your hands like a massage oil.    The scent is a little overwhelming for pregnant women who are sensitve to smell . Very rich, floral and strong- at first I didnt know if I could stand it- but over time, I got used to it and even like it. Bottom line though, it IS strong smelling, and wont be for everybody.    As for preventing stretch marks: I still got some, but not many. They are pretty small and only under my belly. Also, it looks like the lotion has done a good job at fading them to light pink instead of red/purple. Im still pregnant and stretching, but Im sure once Im not, and my skin is going back to normal, this lotion is REALLY going to work at fading stretch marks.    All in all, Im glad I bought it, and will buy again!</li>
    <li> I am only 6 months right now, but have been using tummy butter for the last two months and no stretch marks as of yet! I have no itching, no dryness, and it is a little oily when you first put it on, but that&#x27;s because it is very thick and it soaks in and makes your tummy very soft after a couple of hours. I&#x27;ve even used it on other body parts and it works wonders for itchy, dry skin from the hormones.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like very strong flowery perfume. It also does not melt and dissolve like butter. It pulled my skin a bit and left a tacky like surface (like honey would) even after a few hours. Not soothing on already taunt skin at all. I plan on sending this back. I wish they would at the very least allow the cocoa, shea butter and aloe smells to come through. This stuff will drown out any perfume you&#x27;re wearing. I liked EArth Mama Stretch Oil and Bio Oil better mixed with a bit of raw Coconut Oil.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing, i had doubts about using it because its been 9 months since i had my baby and all the other products that i have tried have done nothing. i use this product twice a day, and after 2 weeks i have seen a shade difference in my marks.. they arent gone, but they are tolerable..</li>
    <li> I have used this product throughout a majority of my pregnancy, faithfully applying it twice a day (like the directions say).  The ingredients are great - it has the cocoa butter (which is a must if people want to attempt to avoid stretch marks) and is all-natural with no parabens or other icky, chemical ingredients.  What I feel to be the major flaw in this product, though, is that it is heavy enough that it doesn&#x27;t absorb very quickly so it ends up feeling like I have this layer of sticky, oily product on my belly/hips before getting dressed in the morning (or climbing into bed at night).  It may be that I am just extra picky - I don&#x27;t like the feel of heavy products on my skin. I have tried other belly balms that are lighter and absorb faster, and have also used several different body oils, and have never had the \\&quot;stickiness\\&quot; problem that I feel with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I want to point out is that, while the product makes the claim to help \\&quot;prevent stretch marks,\\&quot; this is largely a genetic thing and has to do with individual body types so I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in the ability of the product to ward off all stretch marks.  I used this product faithfully for the past four months, twice a day, and still have a few stretch marks showing up.  I&#x27;ll never know if the Tummy Honey Butter helped ward away some stretch marks, but it certainly didn&#x27;t prevent them all!  My doctor said that, while it is good to use the cocoa butter because it helps, ultimately, if you are prone to get stretch marks (genetics, body type, etc.) you will get them!</li>
    <li> I love this belly butter and the only problem I have with it is that it&#x27;s a little thick and sticky, but I easily rectify that by putting it on at the end of my shower so that it spreads more evenly and thinly.  That&#x27;s my only complaint, because it works well, it smells great and most importantly (to me anyway) it&#x27;s paraben- and phthalate-free!  &amp;lt;3  Out of all the brands I&#x27;ve used and smelled, this one is definitely my favorite as far as the scent.  It&#x27;s light and fresh.  I would recommend this to anyone with a baby bump.  They say only genetics can determine whether you get stretch marks or not, but this belly butter definitely stops the itchy uncomfortable feeling and is worth a try!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product because my belly was itching even at 14 weeks.  It did nicely moisturize my stomach, however, when it came, there was an ingredient in the product that was not listed on Amazon or its own website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE: This product contains artificial fragrance/parfum, and the chemical smell is incredibly concentrated; I got dizzy from the smell just from one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a company that claims to be &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and free of &amp;#34;harsh chemicals&amp;#34; on its website and elsewhere, I felt that I was misinformed about the nature of the product, and completely wasted my money on a product that I will never use again nor will recommend to other expectant and new mothers.  Too bad the I already opened the product and tried it; I would demand a return otherwise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 33 weeks pregnant and no stretch marks</li>
    <li> Used this product and never had stretch marks.  However, i think i should warn potential buyers that it doesn&#x27;t really absorb at all and has this greasy texture that you need to get used to and also since it doesn&#x27;t absorb it does get on your maternity clothes. These stains come off once washed and you just need to get used to the texture. You won&#x27;t regret getting this over those uber expensive stretch mark creams.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd pregnancy.  I used cocoa butter with the first two and wasn&#x27;t all that impressed.  This product really seems to be making a difference.  The stretch marks I already had seem to be minimized, and the itching is definitely improved.  This product is slightly greasy, but I just put it on several minutes before I get dressed and it seems to have been absorbed by then.  The smell is also very nice and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have used this stick as well as the original Bella B Tummy Honey Butter and highly recommend both! Yes it is a little gooey but this is my second pregnancy and I haven&#x27;t gotten one stretch mark and they are big babies! I recommend putting it on morning and night and then putting an old shirt on until you get dressed because over time it can build up on your shirts or pants, but just wear an old shirt while getting ready or going to bed and you will be fine. It prevents stretch marks (or it did in me) so I was ok with ruining a shirt for the cause!</li>
    <li> This all around is a no go for me. It doesn&#x27;t stink, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell good. Its more of a watery waxy salve (like pomade but waxy rather than gel like), definitely not i would call butter. Lastly it did not deter stretch marks, which I really wasnt expecting, but it really didn&#x27;t even help fight itchy winter skin. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mother of two, 9 years apart, and used this tummy butter during my second pregnancy.  The scent is fantastic.  It felt great on my skin. It&#x27;s oil based so I applied it each night after my shower to avoid it possibly sticking my clothing to my skin, which it didn&#x27;t do if I allowed time between applying and dressing for bed. The oil base is what makes this product so fantastic, I believe. Its much more rich than a lotion or cream, which would absorb faster, and its moisturizing affect lasted much longer than any other product I used during my 1st pregnancy. I&#x27;m a rather skinny woman and my stomach grew tremendously yet I have zero stretch marks. I may be wrong but I hold this product responsible! I absolutely love love LOVE it! Definitely worth the $.</li>
    <li> It was hard to tell if this was really effective. My wife still ended up with several stretch marks while using this daily with her first pregnancy. With her second pregnancy, she didn&#x27;t use it, and the got about the same number of stretch marks. Also, when she used it, it stained her light-colored shirts. I have heard that the best way to try to prevent stretch marks is just to drink lots of water.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stop the itching and doesn&#x27;t absorb like other options. Burt&#x27;s Bees Belly Butter is much better than this, as it is more moisturizing and isn&#x27;t as waxy. Bella B has other good products, but this one should be avoided.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work I just hated how greasy it was after you put it on. I ruined two shirts bc I wore them after applying. I could still rub it off my skin hours after applying, if you&#x27;re looking for bargain pricing it is cheaper than other options but in the end I have a nearly full tub and stick that I&#x27;m not using any longer because I bite the bullet and upgraded to a more expensive less greasy lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  No new stretchmarks on my stomach yet!  But I don&#x27;t want to jinx it :-)  I am also allergic to some things out on the market and I love that this product is hypoallergenic, smells good, and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I bought this product beacuse 2 of my close friends used it during pregnancy and both of them had no stretch marks. I recieved mine and it was cracked on the bottom. The product almost feels gritty. It sits on my skin and doesn&#x27;t really soak in. It just transferred to clothes and blankets.. I used the whole cantainer and was not impressed. I&#x27;m instead using coconut oil, the real stuff. Much cheaper and 100% natural. It soaks in.</li>
    <li> I give this product five stars because it really does work and it is affordable. Within day one, I noticed that my marks began to Soften, and within a week I noticed a significant difference. The key to this product is definitely consistency. I do recommend that you use this product atleast once every day to see results. However, for guarenteed significant results I recommend that you use this product twice a day. I love this product and I am happy that I finally found a product that is affordable, natural, and really works. No one paid me to write this review and I am not recieving anything in return for rating this product five stars. Give this a try TODAY!!! yOU WILL BE SATISFIED!</li>
    <li> I used this throughout my pregancy and waited to review this until after I gave birth to see if any stretch marks would pop up and I was pleasently suprised to not have any! I used this product everyday, don&#x27;t know if it was the product or genetics (mom doesnt have any stretch marks)...either way I am super happy with using this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 wks pregnant with twins and this is my second pregnancy, so I&#x27;m willing to try anything.  Didnt&#x27; have stretch marks with 1st pregnancy and I mainly used a Palmer&#x27;s and Mustela products, but wanted to try new things with this pregnancy to do everything possible to prevent stretch marks.  So far, so good, but this product is extremely thick!  It does smell good, so if you can handle the gooey, thickness of this, it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I bought it 5 years ago with my first baby and never had a single stretch mark, my stomach was never itchy and it is not greasy at all. As soon as I found out I was expecting baby #2 I bought this honey butter right away and started using it. I am currently 5 months and have no stretch marks, my skin is soft, and it is not itchy at all. I usually apply it at night after I shower and when I wake up in the morning my skin is so soft and moisturized. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is expecting. I realize that stretch marks can be hereditary but I am a firm believer that this tummy butter makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I am in my 36 week of pregnancy and so far I have not seen a single stretch mark. I apply it twice a day in the morning and before bed at night. It s very thick and does leave an oily residue so you will have to always wear an undershirt to protect your nicer clothes, but I guess it is worth it if you want to avoid stretch-marks.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the honey butter and it smells amazing.  I was expecting fragrance free, but the minimal scent is very appealing to me.  It feels really good, but is slightly greaser than slathering Chapstick on my stomach.  I plan to put it on before bed or a couple of hours before a shower so it doesn&#x27;t get on any good clothes.</li>
    <li> it stinks like lillies, if your sensitive to smells, I wouldnt get it, it does work, much better without any scent</li>
    <li> Works BETTER than advertised. My wife has been using it, and doesn&#x27;t have a SINGLE stretch mark at 9 months pregnant. Pretty fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice a day since 12 weeks of pregnancy, occasionally more often when my skin was really itchy. At 37 weeks, I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark. I expected them as all the other women in my family have them. I LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff will stick around, but be warned if you have anything against thick greasy textures, this stuff has that in spades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does all that matter if it works? Nope. So We will see in about a year.</li>
    <li> I bought two products from Amazon for stretch marks when I found out I was pregnant - Bella B Tummy Honey Butter and Earth Mama Angel Stretch Oil.  I really like the feel of my skin after using the Bella B product - it seems to keep my skin moisturized for hours (all day when using it twice a day).  I hadn&#x27;t thought about using it to minimize stretch marks from high school.  Other reviewers say it helps with that, too.  I&#x27;m near the end of the first 4 oz jar and am going to repurchase.  I have to say that the Earth Mama oil made my skin break out within days of using it.  Only soft, moisturized skin with Bella B!  I would recommend it!!</li>
    <li> To be fair, I have to say I didn&#x27;t stick with this product for the long haul. Given its thick, grainy, beeswax-like consistency, I&#x27;m not sure I could stand it. I started using this when I was 2 months pregnant and now, at 3 1/2 months, I&#x27;m already completely out. A little really doesn&#x27;t go a long way in this case, though I did use the product sparingly.  On a positive note, the smell is amazing. It&#x27;s sweet and not overpowering. However, scent alone is not enough to draw me back in for a new canister. For now, I plan on sticking to tried and true products like plain old cocoa butter which are less expensive and easily absorb into the skin, unlike Bella B&#x27;s sticky, grainy residue. As far as whether this stuff prevents stretch marks, guess I will never know! :)</li>
    <li> Used bio oil the first couple months of my pregnancy and it doesn&#x27;t stay on the skin long enough. This product is amazing. Hydrates the skin like 12 hours plus. I even use this on my face before bed and it is helping with my pregnancy acne. I could go on forever about this stuff. Get it and try it. Container lasts about a month since you have to use a good amount 2 times a day, but it&#x27;s worth it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the smell. I have only been using it for two weeks so whether it actually helps with stretch marks I don&#x27;t know. I keep getting emails to review the product. I don&#x27;t want to mislead anyone by giving it 5 stars in case it ends up not working.  UPDATE: I didn&#x27;t get one stretch mark (until after baby came and I stopped using this). I&#x27;ll definitely use this if I&#x27;m ever pregnant again.</li>
    <li> prefered regular lotion, this was hard to get out of container, and seemed sticky.</li>
    <li> Thick, creamy, yes a little greasy but that&#x27;s why it stays on so great. Sorry it can&#x27;t beat genetics or excess weight gain but works great for itching and does as much as any cream could to prevent stretch marks. Used daily for both babies.</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with this. She applied this during the entire pregnancy period 3 years ago, and there is not a single mark left.</li>
    <li> I am currently 33 weeks. I don&#x27;t want to jinx myself, but I have no stretch marks because of this product. I say that because first (1) i got stretch marks in my adolescence and those marks are exhibited on my hips and behind my knees; (2) I wasn&#x27;t exactly an athlete before i got pregnant. It&#x27;s not like i somehow managed to evade genetics; and (3) my sister, my aunt, and my mother all got stretch marks through their pregnancies. When I became pregnant, I knew it was only a matter of time before I too got stretch marks. My defense tactic was to attempt to minimize the marks, since I was convinced I could not avoid them. I did research online and read the amazon reviews and settled on this product. Beginning at 10 weeks I started putting on the Tummy Butter after every shower. I was 152 pounds and 5 feet 9 before I got pregnant. Last time I checked, around a week and a half ago, I am 181 pounds. I have not a single stretch mark. Nada. The drawbacks are that the butter didn&#x27;t stop the itching from week 15 or so to 25. It was a bit slimy too. But I considered that par for the course and frankly, I am still thrilled that I haven&#x27;t gotten a single stretch mark. My sister, who had stretch marks by now, is also impressed. That&#x27;s my story...and I&#x27;m sticking to it. I guess a lot could happen in the remaining 7 weeks, but i&#x27;m so thrilled that I couldn&#x27;t resist writing this review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of lotions, butters, etc during this pregnancy and this is definitely my favorite! I only have 7 weeks left, but am about out and am not hesitating to get more. Here&#x27;s what I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ingredients I can actually read and understand on the label in addition to a good reputation of the parent co that owns this brand. Don&#x27;t take anyone&#x27;s word for it if you really care that much...do your own research to develop your own opinion.&lt;br /&gt;- Grainy texture. Yes, true to the other reviews its grainy. Its supposed to be!! It rubs in right away for me and feels fantastic on my itchy belly. I loooove this and is even less so then a typical shower exfoliant. It does not stick around on skin later, it actually rubs right in. The itch relief is my favorite part.&lt;br /&gt;- Long lasting. Unlike most typical lotions that fades into skin right away this does stick around contributing to some thinking this is greasy. Yah, kind of true. Greasy isn&#x27;t really a term I&#x27;d use; imo its more like any other non-cheap quality butter so what I would expect (just like my La Natura). I have higher confidence this product is doing a better job than cheap lotions as such. That being said, I don&#x27;t have the patience to wait for it to soak in when getting ready in the morning so only use this at night. It goes on and I read a little or watch tv before bed. By the time I&#x27;m ready to sleep its soaked in good enough.&lt;br /&gt;- Light scent. Its very mild which my uber sensitive pregnancy nose highly appreciates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Helps with stretch marks? Maybe. I&#x27;ve heard all the hype is b.s. and genetics are genetics. I can tell you that I&#x27;m 33 weeks, have used this semi-consistently, and don&#x27;t have any yet. Perhaps luck or perhaps good bella b!  Doesn&#x27;t matter, I like this product for its other qualities so deserves my good review.</li>
    <li> Horrible - greasy and doesn&#x27;t even work. It is also very slow drying, I&#x27;m waiting for hours before I can put some cloth on. I would be fine with all these bad things, but it should at least work a little.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! My sister who had twins and no stretch marks recommended it to me. Used it on my first son and worked great. Felt moisturized all day long. Using it again for second baby. Great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when I found out I was pregnant, based on the recommendation of a good friend; she used it with both of her kids, and never got a single stretch mark, so I wanted to try it.  I absolutely hated the texture of this.  It&#x27;s sticky, it&#x27;s greasy, and it could most definitely have been my morning sickness, nausea and hormones in general, but the perfume-y sweet scent was so off putting to me that I didn&#x27;t use it more than a few times.  It didn&#x27;t matter how much or how little I applied, it felt gross and greasy on my belly, and stuck to my clothing.  Not a fan of this at all.  I didn&#x27;t bother returning out of sheer laziness, but it&#x27;s sitting under my sink collecting dust.  There are better belly butters out there.</li>
    <li> Really moisturizes well - it is kind of greasy and stays that way for quite a while, it got on my clothes, but didn&#x27;t stain or anything. Really helps with the itchy skin that comes with pregnancy!</li>
    <li> I used this product RELIGIOUSLY from about week 14 of my pregnancy until week 41 (yeah, late baby) and I did not get one stretch mark. I also drank TONS of water (about 100oz a day) and watched my weight gain I stuck to the 25-35lb range.  I do have stretch marks from earlier in my life, so I really do think this helped keep my skin super moist and elastic.  I never skipped one day, and I also never had an a single itch.  I really do recommend this product, but warn it is pretty greasy but that was worth it for me.  It will get on your clothes, and doesn&#x27;t always soak in - that is my friendly warning but to me it was completely worth it.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this on amazon, but bought it going by all the rave reviews. From all the reviews, it seemed like this is the best budget friendly anti stretchmark cream. I used it quite regularly, it smells ok, but is super greasy, grainy, heavy and extremely sticky. Your skin never absorbs it, sticks to your clothing like glue. It sits on your skin like wax and just stays there right on the surface. I used this in my first pregnancy and really regretted wasting money on this useless product. In fact, I still have some left from back then and I am not using it this time around. It made my belly very very itchy while it is supposed to moisturize it and make it supple and elastic.&lt;br /&gt;If you are meant to get stretch marks, you will get it no matter what. In this product&#x27;s defense, i also used a whole bunch of other creams, oils and lotions (mama bee oil, palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter, bio oil, etc) but NONE of them have worked for me (although using them was a much better experience than using this product) and I have the ugliest stretch marks in the entire world. Please save your money and dont expect miracles.</li>
    <li> First time mommy and I didn&#x27;t know what to help with stretch marks. This product works great and would recommend it to anyone who is expecting. Product came on time am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The product is great! I loved the smell. I already ordered a second one.</li>
    <li> Considering this is my first pregnancy I&#x27;ve been really worried about stretch marks, so my husband and I did some research on different belly butters to use in order to prevent them. Some of the other brands (especially the ones that smelled like chocolate) made me sick. Then we saw an ad for the Bella B starter kit in one of the parenting magazines we got from the hospital and my husband ordered it for me. We&#x27;ve been using it very early on, since I was about 4 months pregnant and I&#x27;m now in my 33 week and I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks. I absolutely love this product, not only for the intended results, but also because it&#x27;s natural and has no smell. Because of my happiness with this product I have also ordered the breast feeding wipes and lotion. I&#x27;ll let you know how they turn out very soon!</li>
    <li> So I have ordered many things from amazon before and have never felt the need to leave a comment.  This product however pretty much demanded it.  I&#x27;m only nine weeks pregnant and don&#x27;t have any stretch marks yet but decided that I would start early to prevent any from hopefully forming.  I couldn&#x27;t decide which brand of belly butter to buy so I bought this product and the mama mio tummy rub butter.  This product came in the mail first.  I was excited about it up until I opened it up and realized it was like a big jar of vaseline.  When I put it on the consistency was identical to vaseline except it was just a little bit thicker.  I had a difficult time even washing it off my hands!  The rest of the day I was sticky and itchy and felt disgusting!  My shirt was suctioned to my stomach.  The anti-itch formula is either a lie or the formula is mixed wrong because I couldn&#x27;t stop itching.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I received the mama mio tummy rub butter today in the mail and not only did it look like what I thought this product was but it rubbed on great, I didn&#x27;t even need to wash my hands because it was like a nice thick lotion and it smelled great.  OH... and I don&#x27;t ITCH!  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I wish all products would list there ingredients on amazon. I recently purchased this item under the impression it is organic but it does contain TBHQ which is a preservative to lengthen shelf life that can potentially lead to ADHD in children if consumed in high amount. The FDA allows a small percentage in products and packaged foods like cereal and crackers etc. but I feel it&#x27;s best to avoid it as much as possible. Just thought you should know if your one of those mommies that like all natural and wholesome products. I did try it a few times but for me it didn&#x27;t seem to reduce the itchiness I was having. I do recommend using Earth Mama*Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil- This product helps me with the itchiness and has only herbal and natural ingredients. My only issue is that its oil so of course you gotta air dry yourself a little after you apply it. I&#x27;m still searching for a lotion that is all natural and will relieve my itchiness, If any of you find one please let me know :)</li>
    <li> This belly butter is fantastic! It glides on smoothly, smells great (like a light honey scent) and doesn&#x27;t leave you very greasy. I did still get some stretch marks but not much, and it doesn&#x27;t matter anyways I don&#x27;t believe a lotion can prevent those. The price is a little steep for me due to how fast I went through it, but I would buy it again next pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I used this product from 12 weeks. At 34 weeks I started getting stretch marks. This product did not help with stretch marks. :(</li>
    <li> Sadly this product gave me allergies.</li>
    <li> I am pregnant with my 9th baby- so I have MANY MANY types of stretch mark cream. First let me say this after reading several other reviews- stretchmarks are not 100% preventable. There are some people who will be more prone to them than others. In addition to using ANY stretch mark balm/butter one must stay as hydrated as possible and even then, there is no guarantee you won&#x27;t get them. Genetics plays a role as well as amount of weight you gain and how quickly you gain it. It&#x27;s science, look it up- google it, research it, what have you- but don&#x27;t blame any product on the market if you wind up with stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will say I am surprised I had never come across this product before now considering all the other products I had tried. I was pleasantly surprised by the smell. To me, it was not overpowering at all. Aloe Vera, Sweet Almond oil and cocoa seed butter are the main ingredients. It has a beeswax base to it so it when you first look at it, it may look like lanolin or petroleum- but its not. The product is marked paraben free. So when I first put it on, it had a slightly greasy feel to it, (the oil, obviously) but within about 15 minutes of rubbing it all over my belly, it soaked in, leaving my skin feeling soft and somewhat silky. I had purchased the 1 oz jar initially and after seeing it&#x27;s performance decided to order the 4 oz.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest rubbing it into your belly either first thing in the morning when you get out of the shower or right before you go to sleep (or both.) That is when I do it. If you are looking for a more \\&quot;lotion-y\\&quot; or \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; feeling belly balm/butter, try a different product.&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints, I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was bound to make my own tummy cream using all natural ingredients: coconut oil, Shea butter, essential oils, etc. but I just wasn&#x27;t getting what I needed. My skin itched and I could feel it stretching and pulling. My mom had extreme stretch marks and I was scared. I bought this under recommendation of a friend and it has been amazing! It&#x27;s pretty greasy feeling, but the relief is instant and now with just a few weeks to go I have gone through 1.5 tubs and have 0 stretch marks! I&#x27;ve also been putting it on the sides of my breasts and my tush because I&#x27;m told those are prone to stretch marks too.</li>
    <li> I had the itchiest belly for such a long time, tried all the other big products - bio oil, coco butter, etc. - this was the only product that finally offered permanent relief!</li>
    <li> I have been using Bella B Tummy Honey Butter throughout most of my pregnancy.  During the first half of it, I used Bella B at night and Revitol during the day.  I also tried Palmer&#x27;s, but found the smell to be too much.  I liked the consistency of Revitol (it is more of a lotion than Bella B, which is more like petroleum jelly), but at double the price, I didn&#x27;t think it was worth it, so I have been using Bella B exclusively for the last half.  I am past 36 weeks and have zero stretch marks.  I use Bella B both at night and in the morning.  Although it is a bit greasy, it lasts all day or all night, which is great.  As long as I apply it in the morning and put a shirt on (and take care to wash my hands off!), I have not had trouble with getting greasiness on my clothes or other surfaces.  Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t say this product prevents stretch marks as it claims (which is why I only rated it four stars). No product can do that, and this one is no different. If you&#x27;re going to get stretch marks you&#x27;re just going to get them. I do still really love it. I&#x27;ve been using since I was about 24 weeks and now I&#x27;m 36 weeks pregnant. Before using this I was using Palmers Tummy Butter which I really didn&#x27;t like. I feel like it helps make the stretch marks fade. I&#x27;ve gotten a few, and using this they already pretty much match my skin complexion. Another review stated that a 4 oz jar lasted their entire pregnancy. I use a liberal amount every morning and night and a 4 oz jar only lasts me about two weeks. I don&#x27;t mind the greasiness of it. It eventually goes away and I feel like it keeps my skin feeling very soft. It does have a weird issue with consistency. Some jars are really gritty and cause my skin to itch. Others just go on smooth and keep the itching away. Nevertheless, I love this stuff and I plan to continue to use it even after I have my baby.</li>
    <li> This product was really great when I bought my first two jars. I recently just bought a third jar and there are little grains that are in it and it makes me feel like there is dirt on my stomach. These little grains also contribute to making my stomach itch rather than giving me relief. I also got stretch marks right after I started using the third jar.  Due to the lack in consistency with this product, I will not be buying it again. If I would&#x27;ve received the third jar first, I would&#x27;ve been really disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; for lack of a better word for the last 7 weeks at least once a day.  I slather a generous amount over all the parts of myself that are stretching with pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s obviously impossible to say whether it&#x27;s working.  I started using it after getting my first stretch mark at 24 weeks.  Since then (now at 31 weeks) I have gotten more stretch marks, but not many.  I can definitely believe I might be worse off if I wasn&#x27;t using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spoke to my dermatologist, and she recommended using some kind of moisturizing lotion.  She didn&#x27;t recommend any particular type or brand or even honey butter specifically.  However, I figure this is as good as any, and the doctor did indicate that moisturizing lotion does make a difference - contrary to people who think genetics is all that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is kind of gross, however.  I use a generous amount, and it&#x27;s annoying having it slathered all over me.  It gets on all my clothes, though it seems to come off reasonably well in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an affordable solution which probably helps on some level.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for stretch marks, though.</li>
    <li> I used this product and think it worked since I have very few stretch marks from my twins. I did not lie how greasy my hands felt after applying but as long as it worked that is a small inconvenience.</li>
    <li> fit perfectly and was a solid product for an outstanding price. I would definately purchase again. Anyone needing these will be happy with the quality/price. My wife used it every day during pregnancy and only had minimal stretch marks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My nose got super sensitive once I was pregnant, and I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of a lot of anti stretch mark ointments. Bella B tummy butter not only smells amazing, but it truly works! I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant, so I can&#x27;t say if the stretch marks will go away or not, but I haven&#x27;t seen any yet (except from my soon-to-be-outie belly button)! It also seems to be helping the scars from my appendectomy (I don&#x27;t recommend surgery at 22 months of pregnancy, so not fun). Either way, it stopped the crazy itching. In the winter nights I&#x27;ve been putting on Burt&#x27;s Bees body oil, then a layer of Bella B tummy butter to keep everything moisturized. The results have been fantastic! I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. Sure a tub is expensive, but mine has lasted 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> Good product although I wish it felt more like a cream or lotion.  It definitely helps with the chronic itchiness.</li>
    <li> This product feels nice, but the smell is a little too strong for me. I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of it, but then order something else.</li>
    <li> I used this starting in my 10th week of pregnancy.  Now I don&#x27;t know if stretch marks are genetic or from not moisturizing enough but I do have stretch marks from before so I fully expected to get them during my pregnancy.  I used this religiously every evening before bed.  It&#x27;s a little too sticky to put on in the morning and then get dressed for work.  The smell was pleasant and not overwhelming.  I managed to get through my pregnancy without any stretch marks even after gaining quite a bit of weight during my last few weeks due to water retention.  I was very impressed with the product and will definitely use it for future pregnancies. . . Two tubs got me through my entire pregnancy.  Definitely worth a try in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not terribly happy with the product. I had been using Palmer&#x27;s Tummy Butter (half the price at Walmart) and decided to try this instead and have been disappointed. It&#x27;s super greasy, I find the smell a bit chemically and unpleasantly floral, and more than anything, it really doesn&#x27;t have much staying power. Pros: less itching. I really do prefer Palmer&#x27;s for the price and the quality.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this stuff works or not but thats because I can&#x27;t stand the way it makes my skin feel.  Super greasy, doesn&#x27;t absorb well, and my clothes then want to stick to my skin.  YUK!  I will move on to a stretch cream lotion and see if that does any better.  On the plus side it smells fine.</li>
    <li> My wife didnt get any stretch marks after our first child. She used this religiously from when she was 4 months pregnant until a month after our daughter was born. It did its purpose.</li>
    <li> Light, great scent, no stretch marks (36 weeks)! I would highly recommend-&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second jar of it! Love!</li>
    <li> I started using this tummy butter when I was 8 weeks pregnant. I used it twice if not three times a day. I started getting stretch marks on my 30th week. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to try to \\&quot;prevent\\&quot; having stretch marks but I think if it&#x27;s in your genes, you really can not do anything to prevent them. I do love the smell of this tummy butter. It is a little greasy but that didn&#x27;t bother me. It did make my skin really soft and it helps with the itchiness. But I don&#x27;t think this is the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; tummy butter a lot of ladies are wishing for :).</li>
    <li> I know stretch marks are hereditary but I still wanted a good tummy butter that&#x27;s super moisturizing for my growing belly.  The smell doesn&#x27;t really bother me, and this honey butter was super oily and moisturizing.  The only that I don&#x27;t like about this product is that when it dries up, it tends to get flakey which was kind of annoying as it got on my shirts. The price is good but I think I&#x27;d just stick to raw coconut oil if I knew it&#x27;d get flakey...</li>
    <li> This is really, really greasy. If it were effective, I would have been fine with all the grease, but it isn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t waste your time on these. The only thing good about it is the smell.</li>
    <li> At 22 weeks pregnant my tummy started  itching terribly, along with my legs and feet. Every night I used the palmers coco butter in the tub and really liked it but it wasnt helping my itching. Tried pure coconut oil, that helped for about 5 minutes. A friend suggested this product. SOLD! I am now going on 33 weeks and have not had a case of the itches since. Can&#x27;t really say anything about preventing stretch marks-- I dont have any yet, dont know if it&#x27;s genetics or the fact that I lotion up with this after my morning shower and use palmer&#x27;s at night. But if you have issues with itching (&amp; its not a medical issue, just strictly from dry and/or stretching skin) this product is amazing! It&#x27;s not as greasy as the Palmer&#x27;s but still is a bit greasy. Doesnt soak right in like regular lotion, but again soaks in better than Palmers. However, that does not bother me one bit! I will take that any day over the itching I was experiencing. Has a nice light clean scent to it also.</li>
    <li> I went through 2 of these during my pregnancy. It wasn&#x27;t overly oily or sticky, had a pleasant scent that wasn&#x27;t overpowering. I&#x27;m giving this a 4 though because the first one I ordered was perfect but the second one was a little bit grainy which I wasn&#x27;t a fan of. But, I will buy this again for my future pregnancies.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I used this for my first pregnancy as directed and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks even though they run in my family.  I am on baby #2 and am buying this in bulk.  Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> It seemes like a waste of money in the end, it was great for the longest time up until the last few weeks I got ridiculous stretch marks.....not really sure there is any cream that can prevent stretch marks, it must be hereditary, unfortunately. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money. Just use normal lotion.</li>
    <li> I used this for my first pregnancy and now using it again. I used it religiously every night.  Its a thick and a bit sticky when you put your shirt back down, but it worked for me.</li>
    <li> Watch out.. The smell of this stuff is so strong I had to wash it off. Twice. Did not get this for stretch marks/baby belly, just looking for an inoffensive &amp; effective replacement for a different butter that no longer exists. Will never buy another Bella b product - yuck.</li>
    <li> Good product, but in my case it didn&#x27;t prevent the stretch marks. my jar was also a bit dry, not as moisterizing as I thought it would be. I have tried numerous stretch mark/tummy product and I have to say that I prefer Argan oil, I use the brand Vitaville, over the butter. I found the oil to be more moisterizing, organic and love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% pure, which I don&#x27;t know if this product is. The ingredients list seem to be kind of long, if you take a look at it.</li>
    <li> I started using this product at 10 weeks. And ended up with stretch marks starting at 35 weeks. The fact that it didn&#x27;t really work isn&#x27;t the issue. What I really didn&#x27;t like about this was its not at all a lotion... its VERY greasy! I ended up putting it on after showers then buying a tank top specifically for wearing after putting this on. It doesn&#x27;t really absorb into the skin very well and in the morning its still greasy... The only thing I did like about it was when I put it on it stopped the burning sensation I was having with the stretch marks (Oh and it smells decent). I seriously don&#x27;t recommend it if your looking for something that will absorb and not get all over EVERYTHING.</li>
    <li> So far I am almost in week 28 of pregnancy and have been using this product since week 8. I love it! I know that they say \\&quot;If you are prone to stretch marks, nothing can stop them\\&quot; well knowing that they run in my family and I have naturally very dry skin, I did not want to help them along. So far I have gained about 25 pounds and no marks with applying this once per day. I love it. If it is not preventing marks it is at least preventing all of the itching that I know comes with stretching skin. I haven&#x27;t been itchy at all, so I know the moisture is getting deep into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Just to give you an idea of how much you will need to order if you are planning to use this product I have applied it to my belly, butt, back and inner thighs since 8 weeks and have gone through almost 3 jars. I am planning to order 2 more and for that to last me to the end. So a total of 5 jars from 8 weeks to 40 weeks.  Obviously going through it faster now that my belly is bigger.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I read in some of the reviews that the product consistency was different in some jars. That some had thicker granules and not as smooth. This happened to me as well but once you rub it through your hands and warm it up it gets smooth and melty, it is an organic product, so this makes sense. Don&#x27;t let it stop you from ordering it totally wasnt a big deal AT ALL!&lt;br /&gt;And as far as it being greasy, yes it is a little greasy, vasaline like. But it does absorb into the skin very fast, I get dressed immediately after applying it and have never stained or ruined or left marks on ANY of my clothes. Yes, 16$ is a lot for a product but I would still recommend it to anyone because I know it works, it is a waste of money to buy lotions, you could apply multiple layers of lotion and not get the affects you get from this product! BUY it and see for yourself!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE****  I ended up carrying my baby girl to 41 weeks, gained a total of 40 lbs and she was over 9 lbs. I only got a couple not too visible stretch marks and I am pretty sure it is all thanks to this product! As I said before stretch marks run in my family so I would definitely attribute my lack of stretch marks to this productle stretch marks and I am pretty sure it is all thanks to this product! As I said before stretch marks run in my family so I would definitely attribute my lack of stretch marks to this product</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my daughter in law, which I bought for my daughter.  She loved it, and both of them swear by it!  I am sorry I forgot to buy it again for my second daughter who is about to give birth in a couple of weeks!</li>
    <li> too goopy, can&#x27;t wear clothes over top, gross.</li>
    <li> I bought this in Januaray for $15.90 and was about to order another one when I saw that the price has almost doubled.  It is much cheaper on other websites.  Does anyone know why Amazon has significantly increased its price for this product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product...give the product 5 stars...but rating it 1 star for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d gotten samples of this and absolutely loved it!  But then when I got the jar of it I was disappointed.  It&#x27;s REALLY gritty.  Like, to the point of almost hurting when you rub it in.  I&#x27;d recommend Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Mama Belly over this now.</li>
    <li> I have waited to write a review until I was &#x27;done&#x27; using it. Done, as in 3 pregnancies later. We happened upon this brand with our first pregnancy...and had no idea what we were doing...or exactly how BIG I was going get. I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 1&amp;#34; and have a rather short-torso....which means those precious bundles of joy do not hide one bit ie they sit totally out front. I faithfully applied this product on my belly my first pregnancy...and ultimately realized that I&#x27;d neglected two areas as these were the only places I got VERY MILD stretch marks (boobs and one flank area). I remedied this for the additional pregnancies and never found an additional stretch mark. Again, this speaks volumes as big as I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to be honest, I never did like the greasiness of this product much, and by third pregnancy I&#x27;d actually ruined a couple of blah shirts that I wore while getting ready for work. BUT I wasn&#x27;t about to give up what had really seemed to work for initial greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read some reviews prior to purchasing it AGAIN for my third pregnancy that the product ingredients had changed...it sure never worked any differently for me in the 4 years of back-to-back-to-back pregnancies. Oh yes, did I not mention that earlier? 3 pregnancies in 4 years, two of which I was considered advanced maternal age (ie old) AND have a strong family history of stretch marks (yes its pertinent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soooo, despite the fact I didn&#x27;t particularly like the &#x27;greasiness&#x27; of the product, I gave it 5 stars and Would use it again in heartbeat if I were ever to be pregger again.</li>
    <li> My wife was using Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil and wanted to try something new so i looked at this product with decent reviews i brought this product. Boy oh boy this product is horrible, it made her tummy itchy and has rashes on her tummy. I dint know how to post pictures, if you guys want proof i can send you guys some pictures . I should have read the reviews more carefully where some people did mentioned about buying this &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; formula &amp;#34;Itchy skin&amp;#34;. I hate it , I was not able to see my wife suffer with the itchy skin on her tummy with rashes during the final months of her pregnancy .</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. My nails had grown out real nice and as soon as I put this on tonight the whites of my nails had many clear spots. Makes me feel like it&#x27;s unsafe.</li>
    <li> the fragrance is overpowering for me. was looking for a product without artificial fragrance (phthalates), didn&#x27;t catch that this has them. if you put the product on at night, it still smells strongly in the morning. i had to wash my skin and clothes to stop smelling it. I didn&#x27;t like the texture either; it&#x27;s heavy and waxy and sticky and i just felt gross with it on. :-( a friend bought me some palmer&#x27;s cocoal butter skin oil from the drugstore, and i like that better. i thought i&#x27;d like this more because it costs more - was just a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I had a girlfriend recommend this tummy butter and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;m 38 weeks pregnant now and measure at 39 but no stretch marks!! I use it more like 3+ times a day now :-)</li>
    <li> The tummy butter is good in that it soothes and moisturizes the tummy but it didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING to prevent stretch marks...I got so many of them anyway! Also, I don&#x27;t like it that the butter has a greasy feel to it. I tried the mama mio tummy rub oil and it doesnt seem as greasy as Bella B. Overall, this product is not effective for its purpose but is a good natural moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used this religiously my entire pregnancy and voila I only have 2 teeny tiny stretch marks! And while I don&#x27;t know if the butter or genetics helped, it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> really don&#x27;t know if this product &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; but def don&#x27;t like the texture.  it is REALLY sticky, like kinda use it sparingly and probably most likely at night, not with your day clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are a lot of products out there, but i&#x27;m big on how it &amp;#34;sits&amp;#34; on your skin and smell, with that being said, i would not have bought this product.</li>
    <li> I discovered this shortly after learning I was pregnant. Bath and Body Works at our mall was consistently out of their cocoa butter stretch mark cream a friend had reccommended. So I was desperate to find a good affordable stretch mark preventative, because my sister developed the worst stretch marks I&#x27;ve ever seen during her pregnancy, and my mom has quite a lot of them too. I also have some leftover from puberty. I found this stuff online and it was very well reviewed and even used by some celebrities, so I decided to give it a go. I also liked the fact that it is all natural, sustainable, and contained all the ingredients I&#x27;d ever heard of using for stretch mark prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it every day during my pregnancy (starting at about 12 weeks), after showering and before bed until 3 weeks before my due date, and did not get a single mark. The ones on my hips from my teen years pretty much disappeared, too. And, in addition, I never had the slightest itchiness that most of my pregnant friends have complained about (another reviewer said it made her itch, so I can only conclude she must be allergic to one of the ingredients). Then I ran out. The store where I&#x27;ve been buying it locally was out of it too. Since I was already so huge, and hadn&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks, I decided to buy some of the Tummy Honey Cream, which they still had in stock. I immediately noticed my skin was kind of itchy and got worse as it dried out and the day wore on. Then, about a week after I stopped using the Tummy Honey Butter, I got a stretch mark. It is not a really dreadful dark red or purple one, but there it is, in all its pinkish brown unsightliness. So of course I went back to the store to see if they had any of the butter yet, if not to fix my new stretch mark, then at least to soothe this infernal itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t. Which is why I&#x27;ve turned to Amazon to find some, quick! Even if my due date is now only 4 days away, I suspect it will help, and may also fade the little stretch marks starting to show up on my breasts. This stuff is mandatory. I think I&#x27;ll buy a case next time I find out I&#x27;m pregnant, so I don&#x27;t run out. If I have extra, it&#x27;ll make a nice baby shower gift for someone.tretch marks starting to show up on my breasts. This stuff is mandatory. I think I&#x27;ll buy a case next time I find out I&#x27;m pregnant, so I don&#x27;t run out. If I have extra, it&#x27;ll make a nice baby shower gift for someone.</li>
    <li> I started using this product on my belly just before I started \\&quot;showing\\&quot; at approx. 5 months, and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks on my belly.  I should have been putting it on my derier because I did get stretch marks back there. :(  Highly recommend this product.  I used approx. 6oz of the product during a 4 month period.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this lotion because it stained my clothes. I absolutely love the basq Advanced Stretch Mark Butter, 4 oz</li>
    <li> Used this throughout my pregnancy on my belly morning and night and only ended up with like 2 stretch marks that popped up in the very last week of pregnancy. Love the smell, not overly greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Though it&#x27;s a high-quality natural product, like many body butters, it leaves you feeling greasy for a while. I recommend Jergens Unscented lotion instead. I switched on a whim mid-way through my pregnancy. It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy film, and I was 100% stretch mark free after 42 weeks of pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I started using this after I got a few stretch marks at 14 weeks pregnant, I am happy to report that at 37 weeks those marks have actually faded and no new ones have formed!  I love the smell but I have to agree it can be a little sticky.  I found that if you put the tummy honey on first and then layer the silk &amp; honey lotion on top it helps!  You can get both in the gift set with Mama Soak which is amazing and helps relax sore hips, legs, and ankles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 23 weeks pregnant,  I used Bella B Tummy Honey Butter for my belly and Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch oil for my breasts, so far so good and no stretch marks. I&#x27;m getting big fast, so i know my skin is stretching and i get itchy some times but both products have helped w my skin issues. The reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the butter is a little on the heavy side and it takes a while for it to be absorbed and it&#x27;s not very smooth, but again it&#x27;s butter not lotion. Overall is good, the main purpose of this product is so that you don;t get stretch marks, so far so good :)</li>
    <li> I originally bought this while shopping at Dillard&#x27;s in Chicago during my first pregnancy. I started applying it in my 2nd trimester and fell in love. I went through it quickly because I applied it twice a day and used a lot at a time. Not a single stretch mark after my son was born! I am now 8 months pregnant with my 2nd and have already gone through two 4oz containers. I love this stuff! I slather it all over my belly, sides, and butt. I have 4 weeks until my due date and have not seen a single stretch mark. I gained 45 lbs with my first and 28lbs so far with my second. My mom said she got stretch marks when she was pregnant and that there&#x27;s no way around it... but there is! It may be pricey for only 4oz but it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny for no stretch marks. I hear other moms complain that their bellies itched while pregnant, but I can say I have never had an itchy tummy. If you want to prevent stretch marks, get this stuff!</li>
    <li> I used this product 2x/day while pregnant and did not get a single stretch mark. I fully expected to get stretch marks during pregnancy because I&#x27;m prone to them but thankfully I escaped without a single one. I found that it also greatly helped with the itching associated with your skin stretching. It does leave a little sticky residue but nothing that&#x27;s too terrible and it doesn&#x27;t stain or goop up your clothes. Will definitely use again for the next pregnancy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 8 months pregnant, and I love this tummy butter--and finally, one that has a decent smell. It really helps with belly itching that come with the stretching.</li>
    <li> In my experience is too thick and difficult to massage into the skin. Didn&#x27;t mind the smell. I&#x27;m not big enough yet to tell if works for stretch marks. Also there is not much product into the container.</li>
    <li> Applied every night during my pregnancy and no stretch marks. I have to agree with other reviews about how sticky can be but it works.</li>
    <li> Yuck.  The texture is just horrible with pebble in it.  I thought eventually they would melt a bit into the skin.  They sure did not.  Also this made my belly itch.  I thought it was a natural part of the stretching belly.  However, I stopped using the product on my belly, and down graded it to the heels of my feet, and then my feet started itching because of the product.  I also have the lotion, which smells like chemicals.  However, the lotion doesn&#x27;t make me itch and it works aside from the unnatural smell.  I prefer L&#x27;Occitanes&#x27; Mama and Baby lotions, etc or just the pure Shea Butter.  They are much more pricey, but worth it.  Or the Mum and Bub from Aden and Anais which is a very thick lotion that smells like vanilla. That product is $10 for 3 oz, and can be purchased on Amazon.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product with my first pregnancy and got ZERO stretch marks! So with this 2nd pregnancy I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again. I believe you have to loyally put it on every single day for it to work. On my first pregnancy I didn&#x27;t start showing until later so I probably started using it around 6-7 months, but with this pregnancy I started showing much earlier so I started using it on month 4. Towards the end I will put it on morning and night just to keep the skin moist and not dry out. I feel it also helps with the itching of the skin while it stretches because it keeps you from getting too dry. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to avoid getting those awful stretch marks!! GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Baby Boutiques and hospitals are selling this stuff for at least 27 dollars a jar! Amazon is by far the cheapest! Stock up while you can! Amazing cream, I don&#x27;t use anything else while being pregnant.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product...it is the FIRST thing I purchase with each pregnancy. I had issues using cocoa butter - skin irritation, greasy feeling, hated the smell - but did not have ANY of those issues with this. There is a nice mild clean smell, and it absorbs into the skin well without leaving residue on my clothing. I have had multiple pregnancies and NOT A SINGLE STRETCH MARK. I love this stuff!! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It smells nice, and seems to work,plus it has an anti-itch ingredient as well. The only negative is it&#x27;s quite greasy.</li>
    <li> Though greasy, it worked great for me. I used it once a day at night from around 12 weeks till end of the the baby was born. I applied on my tummy and back and did not get any marks. I wish I had used it on my thighs too as I did get some marks there. :( I am recommending it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I read I decided to purchase this as soon as I found out I was pregnant.  I used it once a day in the beginning of my pregnancy and twice a day as my belly grew larger (around 7 months).  I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark and I was pretty much a belly with arms and legs. I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> For me the scent of this tummy butter is overpowering and it made my already itchy belly even itchier.  It definitely was not effective for me.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;100% Amazing,&amp;#34; according to my wife. Helps her itchy pregnant belly.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Used twice per day when pregnant throughout pregnancy to delivery day and got NO stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Product touts not being greasy but it definitely is. Also doesn&#x27;t fully soak in to your skin. Smells good though. Have just started using it so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness,</li>
    <li> Used it for my first and second pregnancies and stretch mark free. I have some from childhood and I am genetically inclined, but I didn&#x27;t get any. I loved this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! 2nd pregnancy using this product and not a single stretch mark!</li>
    <li> I used this during my pregnancy. It was a good moisturizer but I still got some stretch marks. I can&#x27;t say if it really works or not.</li>
    <li> It keeps the skin moisturized for almost 8-10 hrs even in winter and helps prevent stretch marks if applied regularly.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with a few others by Bella B for my sister-in-law who is pregnant.  She has told me more than once how much she loves using them and how well they work for her.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stop itching but keeps my skin soft and hydrated.  I&#x27;m 6 months and there are no  stretch marks in sight!</li>
    <li> Livin abroad has its challenges in finding good products. My wife asked me to buy more on this honey butter. Neiter of us find the smell repuslive but it does have a stickness to it. Some may consider it means it&#x27;ll last longer. We are on our 3rd container and not a single stretch mark at 23 weeks. I can&#x27;t claim its the product or her genetics but for the price, its worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m 9 months pregnant &amp; have been using since I found out I was pregnant and I do not have one stretch mark on my thighs or belly. Even my doc is impressed. It is a little greasy, so I recommend applying at night before bed. I love the smell, too.</li>
    <li> not sure how well this works, but im 24 weeks pregnant and no signs of any stretch marks yet. my main issue with this product is that its super sticky. I try to put on very little at a time because it takes FOREVER to soak into your skin. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. I think ill stick to cocobutter and mama mio products</li>
    <li> Used this for first pregnancy and no stretch marks on my stomach. Minor ones on other area but used it most frequently on stomach. My son was born 19 inches and almost 7 lbs. Using it now during second pregnancy. I hope to get the same results.</li>
    <li> I am currently 6.5 months pregnant and have really enjoyed using this product for the past 4 months to prevent stretch marks.  So far, no stretch marks and skin stays so soft without getting too oily. And the smell is really pleasant- a mixture of honey and sugar cookie smell.</li>
    <li> Used this my last two pregnancies and NO STRETCH MARKS....and that is after a total of 4 children.  I know they say it&#x27;s genetics but I think keeping your belly moist also helps.  I liked the smell of it and didn&#x27;t mind that it took a bit to soak in.  Also helped with the itching.  Is my favorite while pregnant.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing i used this during my pregnancy with twins., i still got strrtch marks but they really aren&#x27;t that bad i also used this with my first pregnancy and got no stretch marks</li>
    <li> I ordered this product twice from amazon and both times it did not show up.  The first time I was charged and to this day have not been reimbursed.  The second time, I was notified after a week (several days after it should have arrived) that there was a problem with my order and that if I wanted, I could cancel.  I did cancel and was reimbursed.</li>
    <li> Great product-- never got any stretch marks during either of my pregnancies. It&#x27;s a little greasy but works really great!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I didn&#x27;t get any strech marks until the last few weeks of my pregnancy and I chalk that up to good genes more than anything. Regardless though the product did keep me from itching my belly as much as my skin tightened and was mostorizing without being to greasy. I am still using the product three weeks after having my baby and the streach marks seem to be fading away. I am now buying the product for my best friend who is pregnant.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s friend in China wanted this product. This is the second time buying this product for them so I guess they are happy with it. Fast service and got what we wanted.</li>
    <li> AMAZING. Absolutely amazing. This cured my &amp;#34;itchiness&amp;#34; during pregnancy! Nothing else worked. Not even Palmers! I have suggested this to many expecting mother already!</li>
    <li> Have used before and will contiune to.  Would recomend to any one with a lanolin allergy or who is sensitve to lotions.</li>
    <li> This is a God Send. It helps with itching and keeps skin smooth. I thought I was doomed with my genetics and have used this 2-3X daily since 5 months. I even got stretch marks from puberty and  nothing from this pregnancy: this stuff really does the trick. Great ingredients, it is a little greasy but doesn&#x27;t transfer onto clothes and lasts a long time. I did not smell anything with the odor like other reviews say. The ONLY downfall is the tub is only 4oz ... I had to restock every 3 weeks so it can get pricey! They should know that pregnancy takes 9 months and increase the size!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product when I was about 14 weeks pregnant. It had a nice pleasant scent and was smooth and comforting.  I just wore a tight, long-length tank top over it because it does not absorb as some of the other users have posted. The tank top worked very well for preventing the grease from getting on my work clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of the product and ordered another jar 2 weeks ago (at 28 weeks pregnant) and it was grainy. When I apply it I get this insane itching like I am having an allergic reaction. Its a shame because there were only 14 weeks between the first and second order, yet the consistency was differnt.  I have a feeling the second one is a fake of some sort. It was so very differnt from the first one there is no way it could be the same ingredients. Another user mentioned it could have been how they were stored, but I still feel very suspicious of how the grains of sand manifest in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these should be tested in a lab, as we might be shocked to find out what the ingredients are in the \\&quot;grainy\\&quot; ones. At 30 weeks, I do not have any stretch marks, but from everything I have read if you are going to get them it is usually in the last 2 months of pregnancy anyway. I will post an update after having the baby. In the mean time I will be exchanging this grainy jarfor an ungrainy one and give it one more try.</li>
    <li> I used this a few times but it&#x27;s so gritty - feels like little bits of sand in this, so I really don&#x27;t like applying it.  Stays thick and sticky on the skin for quite a while and has a very strong scent.  Switched to Aveeno with oil lotion and it&#x27;s keeping me stretch mark free without the sticky, gritty, smelly part and I&#x27;m over 7mths along now...</li>
    <li> This product is overall good: smells nice but feels a bit like thick grease, but overall a nice substance for the belly. I do not know if it prevents stretch marks or not.. I am 22 weeks and don&#x27;t have any yet.</li>
    <li> sweet smell, rich texture, affordable price make me confortable.  Having it in my second trimester, will keep using it!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin moist all day. No stretch marks so far :)</li>
    <li> BEST. STRETCH MARK. CREAM. EVER. I would highly recommend. Does not smell and does not get all over your clothes. Goes on smoothly and is not greasy like most stretch mark cream. I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks and I used this once a day since the beginning of my second trimester. I have bought this for my friends for gifts as well!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I am currently at eighteen weeks. I was more looking for a moisturizing lotion to ease the itch from the skin stretching.    I had mistakenly purchased this product, thinking it was fragrance free. I am sometimes allergic and sensitive to fragrances. Sometimes I&#x27;m fine and sometimes I&#x27;m not but I decided to give this product a try and see what happened especially since the smell of this product was so pleasant. I did not have a reaction to the fragrance in this product (for whatever that&#x27;s worth), however I would not recommend this to anyone.    Even though I found that it eased the itch, it didn&#x27;t do so as much as I&#x27;d hoped. This product was extremely sticky. Applying it was difficult. Even rubbing it between my hands first didn&#x27;t help. It was difficult to apply and spread on my skin. By far the most negative aspect is the greasy/oily residue it left on my stomach that took hours to go away.    EDIT: I&#x27;ve changed this review from one star to two. I had applied the product in the late evening, after taking a shower. In the morning, the oily/greasy feeling had gone away but what it had left behind was even worse. My skin feeling dirty - like I&#x27;d done a whole day&#x27;s worth of hard work in the middle of summer. The residue had transferred to the sheets and the t-shirt I had slept in. I had to completely strip my bed and wash everything. The sheets hadn&#x27;t only been on the bed a day.</li>
    <li> 19 weeks along and no stretch marks so far.....it does feel waxy on, but seems to be working.  Hoping this keeps working through the end!</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff a while ago thinking it would help me with stretch marks.  Since then I&#x27;ve researched and found that there is NO scientific evidence whatsoever that any creams can help prevent stretch marks.  It&#x27;s mostly just genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, that doesn&#x27;t really have to do with the quality of the product (or lack thereof). This stuff is gooey, greasy, sticky, messy and horrible.  Seriously, I felt like I was trying to rub vaseline on my stomach and wait for it to soak in.  My skin never absorbed it and it was a disgusting layer of sticky slime under my clothes.  After applying I had to wash it off my hands because it is impossible to rub this stuff in like normal lotion. After a few minutes I would always end up washing it off my belly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried hard to like this stuff because I hate to waste money.  I used it at least 5 times before decided enough was enough and throwing it in the trash.  Definitely not worth the price when you can buy Palmer&#x27;s for much cheaper (and whaddayaknow, it actually gets absorbed by skin).  This tummy butter CRAP ended up in the trash can.</li>
    <li> I had great expectations from this item based on the reviews...after I tried it I was really disappointed. This product is GREASY like hell! After 20 minutes I still can&#x27;t put my shirt over my belly. My skin just never absorbs it. I always have this sweaty feeling. It smells good/ok though.</li>
    <li> Received the product without a seal. Butter was greasy and hard to absorb, doesnt have a pleasant smell either, will not purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this product, all oils, butters in one.. this is just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You so much! I love it</li>
    <li> Smells great! Not too greasy!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1AM7XWU7AB8F9]]The Video:&lt;br /&gt;I tried to do a quick video to explain the difference in the butter. I hope it assists someone in making a decision. I didn&#x27;t say it in the video but I used the Bella B product for most of the 1st pregnacy. I started my 2nd pregnancy with the Mama Bee product because I had some left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;At 6 weeks of my first pregnancy I began using this product. I really like it. My husband would rub it on me in the mornings. We placed it on my stomach and a little on my back because I usually needed a light massage as well.  I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks after birth. I cannot say for sure it was this product or not.  All I can say it that, \\&quot;Yes I used the product almost daily and No, I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ It did not have a strong odor. I liked the mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;+ Was not too greasy&lt;br /&gt;+ Good price&lt;br /&gt;+ I like the smell of the product&lt;br /&gt;+ I like the way this feels on my skin better than the Burt&#x27;s Bees product. That is just my preference.&lt;br /&gt;+ Great product. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I also used Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter along with this product for the last month or two of my first pregnacy. It is less greasy than this product. Therefore, it doesn&#x27;t stick to your clothes as much. Burt&#x27;s Bees is more of a creamy texture like lotion. This product is more of a Vaseline texture. I am on my 2nd pregnancy and I am using the Burt&#x27;s Bees product because I had some left over. I thought I re-ordered this but I guess I didn&#x27;t.</li>
</ol>
