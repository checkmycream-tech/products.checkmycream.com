      <li>This will not be effective if the microneedles do not penetrate your skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tremendous Customer Service ! I am really impressed with the results of the Derma Roller.</li>
    <li> Feels and looks great, made of high quality materials and functions as promised. I did not use any numbing cream and the process is uncomfortable but not painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am darker skin complexion (South East Asian) and have acne scars (ice pick and box car) and there are no good therapies to reduce scarring especially in people with my colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest edition of Fitzpatrick&#x27;s Dermatology outlines promising results by combining skin needling and chemical peels. At the moment I am combing 50% glyolic acid peels twice weekly and using 1.0 roller every 4 weeks (at this length do not use more often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one treatment of the dermaroller and 6 peels I am noticing a slight decrease in pitting, decrease wrinkles and overall healthier look to skin. Ideal results should be experiences within 4-6 months. Hope that helps others in my position</li>
    <li> Love this derma roller.</li>
    <li> I love this Derma Roller.  I tried other derma rollers in the past and i honestly wasn&#x27;t so sure ab them.  I really liked this one. the handle fits perfectly in my hand is very comfortable.  I thought this would really hurt my skin but it really wasn&#x27;t so bad.  I havent used this long enough to see long term results but for the time i have been using this i have noticed my skin is looking smoother and healthier.  I have very sensitive skin and it only left my skin pink for a little while and then it went away. I am excited to see the long term results of this! I am going to try this on my cellulite on my legs next and am excited to see the results!</li>
    <li> Love my derma roller absolutely the best beauty product I have purchased in my life, because it produces results naturally and aggressively...</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! Although its a little painful the end results were great couldn&#x27;t ask for more...</li>
    <li> As a licensed Esthetician and Makeup Artist, I am always trying different things to achieve glowing, beautiful skin. With the Beautonics Derma Roller I can achieve just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beautonics Derma Roller is a device that has 192 1.0mm Titanium Microneedles attached to a roller that you use on your face or body. The microneedles will pierce your skin and make tiny little needle pricks which will increase your product absorption by 1.000 percent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Derma Rolling and what will it do for my skin?&lt;br /&gt;Derma Rolling is the process of causing a controlled trauma to the skin to induce new collagen growth. Derma rolling creates micro channels into your skin causing the growth of new tissue, which can be great for achieving youthful looking skin. It will also greatly help the penetration of your skincare products, it is best to use your best serum and moisturizer immediately following a derma rolling session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma Rolling improves:&lt;br /&gt;Uneven pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;Scars&lt;br /&gt;Stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;Sun Spots&lt;br /&gt;Acne&lt;br /&gt;Fine Lines&lt;br /&gt;Deep wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;Loose Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I properly Derma Roll my skin?&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse your skin thoroughly using your normal cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Let your skin air dry&lt;br /&gt;Take the Derma Roller and choose an area to start with (I start on my chin)&lt;br /&gt;Roll the Derma Roller in a star pattern 6 times horizontally, 6 times vertically, 6 times vertically. This ensures that you are getting the maximum benefit and every area of your face is being derma rolled. A back and forth roll counts as two rolls.&lt;br /&gt;Repeat this step all the way over your entire area to be treated. Do not skip any areas, be careful when you get closer to your eyes and use slightly less pressure.&lt;br /&gt;Some notes from a professional:&lt;br /&gt;Use a medium pressure when derma rolling at all times. This will not be effective if the microneedles do not penetrate your skin. If you feel that you are unable to use a medium pressure on yourself, have it professionally done, or use a topical numbing agent like Lidocaine.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it will be uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you may have some pinprick bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;When you are done derma rolling your skin you will feel like you have a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;Use this time to apply your best products, your skin needs it!&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS apply a sunscreen when going out after derma rolling.&lt;br /&gt;The Beautonics Derma Roller is a very high quality Derma Roller. I appreciate the fact that the handle is curved, it makes the rolling a little bit easier and more comfortable for my hands. The needles are evenly spaced, and a 1.0mm is a great length needle for my skin. I have been using this every other week for about a month now, and I see that my skin is much brighter, it feels more firm, and some of my hyperpigmentation is going down.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Beautonics Derma Roller to anyone that has dull, saggy skin or wrinkles. This would greatly help with proper use! Please see my directions, or look up instructions online before using this on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free to evaluate, but these are my own opinions.professionally done, or use a topical numbing agent like Lidocaine.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it will be uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you may have some pinprick bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;When you are done derma rolling your skin you will feel like you have a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;Use this time to apply your best products, your skin needs it!&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS apply a sunscreen when going out after derma rolling.&lt;br /&gt;The Beautonics Derma Roller is a very high quality Derma Roller.

    <li> This is the third Derma Roller I purchased for my wife. She loves the results from using a Derma Roller (5 Stars). The 2 star rating is for the quality of this particular roller. The roller did not rotate freely compared to her other two Derma Rollers; both from two different manufacturers. Maybe it was just a manufacturing defect with this roller. My wife returned the roller for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I purchase many items through Amazon; this was the first time we returned an Item. Amazon made the return process so easy and painless. I love using Amazon.</li>
    <li> I found this tool easy to use and I can not see yet if it works...but I have confidence that it will...</li>
    <li> ***Disclaimer*** I received this for free,for review purposes,all thoughts and or opinions are my own and I was not compensated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a actually used a derma roller before,i received one prior to this for review and loved that one as well,although I cannot remember if they are from the same company I do believe this one is more towards the professional level.It is a pretty gold color which I love,and I know everyone is think needles oh no! ,not to worry these microscopic and they do not hurt.In fact they tickle it can take a few times for your skin to get used to it,i know it did for my,i used to get this all of the face tingly sensation which sort of made me itchy but it goes away after you use it a little.I got this ahead of schedule and it shipped out super fast.My most favorite thing is that after you use this everything absorbs into your face 100 times better,i literally apply blemish cleanser or use facial towelettes for acne a few times a week and I feel like when i don’t use a scrub I’m not getting my face clean but after using my new derma roller and then cleansing or using my wipes i felt super clean,no joke.I will be keeping this in my bathroom to use before I cleanse at least a few times a week.Now this will help you prevent acne,but you do not want to use it on your face if you already have active acne,thankfully mines cleared up if yours hasn’t just wait it out for a few days till it clears then go ahead and roll again.One thing it says it helps with is hair loss and promoting new growth,but really all it did was rip my hair out,i think if you have short hair it might work but for me it didn’t,at least not for that.My skin used to be super puffy under my eyes and since i started using this it has decreased somewhat I can’t wait to see how awesome they look in another week or so.You can purchase this derma roller or look at the others they offer at the link provided below,it costs $29.95 an amazing deal on amazon.Please note all pricing is subject to change per the discretion of the company.ricing is subject to change per the discretion of the company.</li>
    <li> Amazing Derma Roller.  Best at home Derma Roller I have ever used.  It has helped to shrink my pore size, tighten my skin, smooth fine lines, work on my sun damage and melasma.  I derma roll the correct way and then apply a mask with arbutin and hylauronic acid immediately after.  I have never received so many compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this roller to treat my acne scars. It seems as if people are using this product in one of two ways, it is either being used regulary, e.g.daily or periodically, e.g. 1/week. I decided to use it 1/week with the idea of being somewhat agressive then allowing one week for my skin to completely heal before my next treatment. I couldn&#x27;t be as agressive as I wanted to be during my first two uses since I did not purchase a numbing cream. I had my third use yesterday after first numbing my skin with Greencaine and achieved some bleeding. Today my face is still red like from a severe sunburn and dry and tight but will likely be completely healed in a couple of days. I will also add a vitamin-c serum next week.As for results after two weeks....I haven&#x27;t seen much difference, maybe slightly smoother/tighter. But I believe that it is too early to tell and will report back in a few weeks. I have paid thousands for professional peels and laser skin resurfacing with disappointing results. I&#x27;m cautiously optimisitic that a $30 product will deliver any better results but we&#x27;ll see.    ***Update*** 1/27/2015 - I have now had this roller for about 1 month and have used it five times (I paired it with the Amara Organics Vitamin C serum after my last use and will continue doing so). I have very large pores around my sinus area that I attribute to my very long struggle with acne and therefore focused on these areas when using the roller. My face completely healed today after my last use a few days ago and I used a magnifying mirror to check for results. I am very happy to say that there is remarkable improvement in pore size in these areas. I was not even able to see my pores in a couple places. This is very encouraging. However there does not seem to be any visible improvement to my acne scars at this point. I will continue using the roller and report back in another month hopefully with even better news.    **Update** 2/14/2015 - It took 4- 6 weeks for me to begin seeing improvement to my acne scars. And after reading more about micro-needling this time-frame seems to be typical. My scars are getting shallower and one has even disappeared completely. Awesome! However the greatest improvement has been to areas of hyperpigmentation. The hyperpigmentation is completely gone (likely attributed to the combination of the roller and the Vitamin-C serum)! I have now ordered an electric dermapen and will no longer use the roller. A dermapen is supposed to lessen the downtime because the needles penetrate at a 90 degree angle vs rolling over your skin. This damages the skin less allowing for faster healing. Another advantage is the depth of the needles can be set for different areas of your face. We&#x27;ll see how well it works. In any case, at this point I can conclude that microneedling is effective but requires a long-term committment in order to get results.</li>
    <li> Only used it once but I did like it and time will tell if there is any change in my skin</li>
    <li> I am noticing an improvement in my skin and I use this every morning before I apply my long and drawn out morning skin care routine. To be fair I did change a couple things at the same time. I drink a lot of water, changed some of my topical serums and moisturizers and began taking a collagen powder and I&#x27;m sure this little tool plays a part in the improvement I&#x27;ve been noticing.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift for someone who was looking to purchase one. The person I gave it to said that  it&#x27;s great but I really have no further information on it other than that.</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m really afraid of it, tried a few times to use it but I&#x27;m too afraid I am going to do damage on my skin, instead of helping it....</li>
    <li> what a difference on my neck. I&#x27;ll send photos soon</li>
    <li> Have used three times now. Too soon for results but am very happy with th product so far. Exactly as described and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Cant say enough good stuff - just love what it does and I have had many people notice</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a Derma Roller. The Derma Roller is high quality and I like that it came in a storage case. The first time I used it I used it after I cleansed my face. At first it hurt a bit but that was kind of expected since there are hundreds of needles rolling on your skin. The Derma Roller opened up my pores which increased the effects of my facial serums. My pores are shrinking and the overall tone and appearance of my skin has improved. I also use the Derma Roller on my stretch marks along with a stretch mark and cellulite cream. It also helps to increase the effectiveness of the stretch mark and cellulite cream. Other than the discomfort which seems to come with using any Derma Roller I’m pleased with the results. I would recommend this product to a friend who wants to improve the quality of their skin.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for me.  It might be because my skin is too sensitive.  It is extremely painful to use and couldn&#x27;t continue using it long enough to see results.</li>
    <li> Works realy good. Just be careful on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing a I don like is because the product need extra information.</li>
    <li> I purchased the derma roller about 3 weeks ago. I&#x27;m currently using it with the vitamin C serum as well as trilastin cream for stretch marks. I can see a little bit of a difference not to much, its to soon to tell. Normally to see results you have use it for months since the skin needs time to recover. I will check back in about 3-4 months and give an update.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my &amp;#34;derma-roller&amp;#34; product twice now. (30 days between each use.) So far, I followed the directions and have used the vitamin C products afterwards. It first felt  slightly uncomfortable at first, but after getting the hang of it, it was not as bad as some people claim. The pain is very minimal. My face glows a healthy pink after the use but in the following days I&#x27;ve experienced improved skin texture and enjoy wearing less makeup -- not to mention I feel less self-conscious about my skin. I look forward to greater improvement after repeated use. It is a great addition to your skin routine.</li>
    <li> Try the derma roller on my legs first because I was afraid of the needles. Didn&#x27;t find it painful at all. Have been using for about 2 weeks and I see the differences on the back of my legs. The skin feels tighter. I also apply cream after using it. Try not to apply too much pressure as you made hurt yourself.</li>
    <li> When I was a teenager, puberty did a number of things on me and I was constantly covered in acne. I have used dozens and dozens of different brands of creams and ointment, all advertised to get rid of my old acne scars, but none helped! I was desperate. A friend of mine had used this product and recommended it (her skin is so youthful and lovely, of course I had to check it out!). The needles made me a little nervous, but they were so much smaller than I expected, and didn&#x27;t hurt a bit! I&#x27;m so relieved to have finally found something that works! I&#x27;m definitely going to recommend the derma roller to all my friends, and maybe even my husband.</li>
    <li> I had some pretty great hopes for this product but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t deliver like I wanted it to. Yes I know they&#x27;re little needles and it hurts a bit but I just couldn&#x27;t handle it. I tested it on my hand first and it hurt (4 out of 10) and then on my face gently and it hurt even more. It could be my semi-sensitive skin but I really did want this product to work for me but it just didn&#x27;t. I think these are pretty &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; and therefore all the hype nowadays. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but hey as they say, beauty is pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in return for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I really love using this. It is not painful and it helps so much in taking care of my skin. It helps to exfoliate and retexture my skin. I&#x27;m so happy I can do this treatment at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I receive this product for free for consideration of a review. All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> This is better than the other expensive brand I&#x27;m always purchasing here in Amazon. It&#x27;s cheaper and it works! I highly recommend it. :-)</li>
    <li> This product works really well. It made my wrinkles go away.</li>
    <li> Amazing product 10/10 reccomend, product met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Fulfills all that id hope for.</li>
    <li> The derma roller is really effective. The first time I tried it, it was an awkward sensation but I saw some change right away. The blemishes on my face smoothed out and became flat. My face was a little red and I can feel the increase blood flow. After a few times, major blemishes were barely visible. I am still going through the treatment, will update with final results, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off because albeit the professional packaging and build of this particular derma roller, I would wish they would put thorough descriptions on how to use the roller effectively.</li>
    <li> This Beautonics Derma Roller is one that can help with age spots, scars, wrinkles, etc. The fact that it comes with a case is a huge bonus! The case is a great way to keep it clean but be sure to spray the derma roller with rubbing alcohol before storing it for the next use. I bough it for my wife. After using derma roller her face will turn a bit red, but the redness will go away in about 15 mins. She always does it before sleep to make it a non issue. She put on some vitamin C serum and Hyaluronic acid after using the roller and her skin looks better than ever.  This product was received for the purpose of testing and unbiased review</li>
    <li> love my new derma roller! i had a scar on my leg that i really didn&#x27;t like and started to use this dermaroller on. i have been using a little over a week now and i can see the difference! my scar is fading and i feel better about wearing shorts and skirts now! it looks a little scary but i promise its not! the first couple times you use it you get this kind of sunburn look but it goes away very quickly. so glad i got this free for testing and review.</li>
    <li> I really think the people that are giving this beauty tool a bad mark have never used a derma roller before. This one is AWESOME! It arrives in a sealed container, that right there deserves 10 stars! These are little needles you want them to be sent to you like any needle item!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does hurt. I do my treatment at night before bed. I don&#x27;t have have redness in the morning. I don&#x27;t have bleeding at anytime. This Derma Roller is 100% worth a little discomfort!! AND it&#x27;s guaranteed!! I promise you will see a difference in your skin!</li>
    <li> Whenever i used this roller, later my skin texture used to change. I got some small patches the place I used the roller.</li>
    <li> Very good, just what I was expecting! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am not a professional or any kind of skin expert. I just took a huge risk buying this product, not to expect it to work in my favor. I would say it&#x27;s simply a magic wand or maybe a time machine. It surely took some years off my facial appearance. It made my face look more vibrant and more radiant than ever before. I was tired of my dull appearance for a long time. I guess not anymore. 👍</li>
    <li> I have always been intrigued by these derma rollers but never gave them a chance until now. It is very easy to use and you can actually see results after only a short time. It is pretty sharp for a small tool, but if you use it correctly you&#x27;ll have great results. I think this would make a great gift for anyone (man or woman) and using it properly will give you smoother skin, less cellulite, and less visible scars.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with the results. I&#x27;ve noticed my face is plumper, softer, pores are getting smaller. The quality of product is very well made I would recommend this derma roller. I am 53 and have some scaring and I can&#x27;t wait to see what the out come will be. Thank you so much for keeping in touch</li>
    <li> Very high quality. It hurts but it works! Under eye area and forehead lines softened after first use. Use high quality skincare products after, this definitely increases absorption rate. I&#x27;m counting on seeing long term benefits and results in a few more months!</li>
    <li> use it a few times a month!</li>
    <li> I cannot rate this, as it came with no instructions, so I do not know how to use it!!!</li>
    <li> At first I didnt like the feel of it, but the product does work well.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I use,soon after I use vitamin c,after vitamin c dry I put my daily cream,I&#x27;m trying to use once a week. I&#x27;m already feeling difference my pores are well sealed. ;)</li>
    <li> This derma roller was a little scary at first and have to admit it did hurt the first couple times I used it. I have been using for 2 weeks for about 3 times he first week then again the second week. I am adjusting to it and it is working fine for me. My face is looking better and my pores seem to be getting smaller. The blackheads I&#x27;ve had forever seem to be going away also. I will continue to test this product for my unbias review and can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a month of use. I would recommend this derma roller to those who are not afraid of a little pain for great results. Thank you..</li>
    <li> This product comes securely packaged.  I was surprised to see it was sterile upon arrival.  This showed me how serious they are about making sure one keeps this product cleaned.  Use only on a clean area.  Do not share.  The needles are sharp, but I have never drawn blood.  I really feel this has made a difference in my skin care.  sample provided</li>
    <li> I have not seen results yet. I have only used it once. Thank you for the tips on using this device. My sister uses one and her skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this roller a try after my friend recommended it to me, after just a couple of days I could tell the difference on my skin, it looks a lot better now and feels softer. I would recommend this to anyone looking for better skin.</li>
    <li> Great product actually! Got it for my wife and it cleared up her skin after about 5-6 uses, she seemed pretty satisfied!</li>
    <li> When I first heard everyone talking about this product, I wondered what it was. When I first saw this product, I wondered why in the heck would anyone want to use that. I mean seriously, micro needles.....on a roller....are you kidding me? Is this for the guy on the movie Hellraiser? I didn&#x27;t want anything to do with it, but I kept hearing more and more so I did a little research and found my curiosity piqued. I have a lot of scars on my body, easily 75% of my body is scarred. I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists and have tried numerous treatments, even skin bleaching but nothing has ever really helped that much. This is truly why I wanted to try this derma roller, I have absolutely nothing left to lose, my skin is already damaged. I wasn&#x27;t to keen about the many needles but I&#x27;ve had worse, I have tattoos so this should be no biggie, right?? I first tried it on my arm, it doesn&#x27;t hurt. It&#x27;s actually kinda an odd sensation, not unpleasant but similar to when your hand or foot falls asleep. I then tried it on my leg, my calf and shin to be exact and again, doesn&#x27;t hurt. So I got brave, yep, I tried it on my face. It didn&#x27;t hurt but it didn&#x27;t feel great either at first, after several more rolls over different areas, I decided I would wash my face and do it again the next day. And I did, I used the roller for 5 consecutive days on my arm, leg, and one side of face. My scars have lightened and there&#x27;s actual pink skin coming back to where it used to be just brown. On my face I noticed how soft and fresh my skin felt. I definitely will continue to use this on a daily basis on all my other parts of my body now that I know it&#x27;s working. I did receive this to review but that has no bearing on my opinions, honesty, and statements. My review wouldn&#x27;t be posted if I didn&#x27;t like or actually believe in this product. You should really try this for yourself though, it may look scary but it works like magic.</li>
    <li> Ok - at first you might think ....&amp;#34; I am rolling this cylinder of small needles all over my face .....and loving it ? &amp;#34; Well, you would be right. Do your research, buy quality  equipment (like this one), go to youtube and watch someone braver than you and you will figure it all out. You will thank me later !</li>
    <li> This works great. I used it between my Acupuncture Face lift treatments!</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Derma Roller for about 2weeks now and am definitely seeing a improvement. I have gotten dark spots on my face and now I can see them breaking down and getting lighter. I love that the seller is periodically checking back with you for an update on your satisfaction. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Beautonics sent me this Derma Roller to review for my blog, GlamRiver.  This product is a Holy Grail, Must Have beauty tool!  I love this thing and I think everyone should own and use one.  I am not sure how I ever survived without one of these!  It has helped all of my products absorb better, keep my skin clear, helped reduce appearance of scars and even helped diminish fine lines!  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is well made and I really like the results. I have been derma rolling for about a month.  My skin is much smoother and looks healthier.</li>
    <li> Perfect derma roller. This is the best needle length for me. The wheel rolls easily and it&#x27;s not hard to handle. Helps my acne scars on my arms disappear! Definitely a high quality roller.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and I can see a difference in my skin.  I suffer from heavy under-eye bags due to sinuses and my bags have improved in appearance.  My face has exfoliated and I no longer have unsightly pores.  I have already recommended the derma roller to my mom and a co-worker.  I did buy a numbing cream to use with this derma roller but I haven&#x27;t even opened it as I haven&#x27;t found it to be painful at all.  I use mine twice a day, morning and evening and don&#x27;t see lasting irritation.  I will continue to use this derma roller faithfully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 46 I had spider veins I rolled it over 10 times 3 days ago and it broke it up. I love this derma roller I&#x27;m going to get 1 for my sister.</li>
    <li> Ouch, but it&#x27;s working on getting the lotion in.  I&#x27;m not sure about getting rid of cellulite, but I&#x27;m still giving it a go.</li>
    <li> I use now Derma Roll size 1 I did not recognize the size of this new roll Alderma I want a little larger than one size of the pores and remove scars</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that would make my skin smooth,while taking care of any scarring and derma roller did it! It&#x27;s worth it if you&#x27;re looking for a more natural way to make your skin healthy. I definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> Wow, this is new for me, stings a little, but I will continue to use it. Came as pictured and was packaged great.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I see a HUGE result in two weeks.  My lines are getting smaller.  My neck is smoother.  GREAT product and Awesome company</li>
    <li> I started Micro Needling since last week. I like how light this roller is and it is easy to roll around my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;When I first started rolling, I used numbing cream.  Today, I decided to do something different.  I skipped the numbing and went right to roll.  I just cleaned my face real well with my Clarisonic Mia brush, applied the Shiseido Bio-Performance Advanced super restoring cream.  And started using the roller all over my face and neck.  This time, I decided to go real aggressive.  I rolled over each area of my face for over 5 minutes.  My face got red like I had a sunburn but I did not bleed at all.  Some people describe the sensation as &amp;#34;severe pain&amp;#34; but to me, it is like sunburn.  It is really not painful.  The weird thing is I sneezed non-stop when I rolled the derma roller over my forehead.  That happened to me last time when I rolled my forehead as well.  It was like the needles were tickling my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I feel refresh after doing my own micro needling.  I will give you an update if I start seeing result.  By the way, I just realized this roller is 1mm.  I think my skin is way thick that is why I don&#x27;t feel anything? I don&#x27;t know.  I can&#x27;t wait to see my naso labial fold and the uneven skin tone all gone!</li>
    <li> great product.  after 2 weeks, nice smooth skin</li>
    <li> I hace used many derma rollers in the past year. I suffer from bad acne scars that really just stop me from feeling the best that I can about myself. After many years of searching for a treatment, I came across an article about derma rolling. I did alot of research and decided I wanted to try it. I knew it was not a quick fix but I had to start somewhere. This derma roller is very comfortable to use. The grip is nice and perfect size to use comfortably. The roller was also a great size as it reached in all the smaller areas as well. It&#x27;s very durable and the needles are nice and sharp. Dull needles can cause much more damage than good. I love the safety storage container. It keeps the needles from getting bent if it falls or gets knocked off of a counter, but the best part is it keeps it more sanitary between uses. I sanitize the roller and my face before and after each use. I use it about once every six weeks and follow up with a vitamin c serum. It has softened my scars and fine lines alot! I am so excited I recieved this product complimentary for my review, I can&#x27;t wait to see my results in a few more months!</li>
    <li> It seems like when you are a kid there is a race to look and be grown up and then once you get there it&#x27;s a race to slow down and look and be young. Well, I am on the later half of the race, but with joy. The Beautonics Clinicares Treatment Solution Derma Roller is a tool that you can use at home to do just that, help you join the race to slow down and look young. (Anyone can act young, right?) A Derma roller can help with age spots, wrinkles, stretch marks and scars, plus more. Sounded good to me and I figured it was worth a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the Beautonics Clinicares Treatment Solution Derma Roller comes in a sealed container. Once I opened my container I found that there were no instruction in my box or container. On the outside of the box it says do not reuse the head, do not share with another person, do not use more than the indicated time, always clean the roller and your face before and after each use and store in a safe place out of the reach of children. That was all good to know, but I wanted to know how to actually use it. I decided to look up the directions on the Internet because when I opened up the Derma roller and saw all the needles, I though I better learn how to use this correctly! It was easy to find the information on the Internet, I read everything I could find and felt comfortable enough to get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read to roll with a little bit of pressure about ten times up, down, back and forth and also diagonally. I also read it hurtst a little. Okay, so trying it the first time I was super cautious. It does hurt but not in a long term bad kind of way. It is not really that bad and I felt like I could handle it. I guess because it ended up being so simple to use it didn&#x27;t really need directions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few of those age problems that the Derma roller should be able to help with; I have age spots, wrinkles and scars. I got this Beautonics Clinicares Treatment Solution Derma Roller to use on my face, but ended up using it lots of places. I wax my legs so I feel I have a high pain tolerance for things like this and as I was rolling this Beautonics Clinicares Treatment Solution Derma Roller on my face, neck, chest, and stomach I realized this was easy and I could do this every day. The Beautonics Clinicares Treatment Solution Derma Roller is easy to use and I really hope I continue to use this!g it lots of places. I wax my legs so I feel I have a high pain tolerance for things like this and as I was rolling this Beautonics Clinicares Treatment Solution Derma Roller on my face, neck, chest, and stomach I realized this was easy and I could do this every day.

    <li> The product have a serious problem The handle painted silver tone paint. I use couple time even I didn&#x27;t realize painting removing and colored on my hand Probably into my face Omg. Seller have to Compensation for damages</li>
    <li> I have the 0.5 mm and see better results from that one on my face, probably will use this on my body instead.</li>
    <li> This Product is absolutely amazing, I received it a few days ago and it has already shown remarkable results. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This came in an awesome little case and had a nice little case just for the needle roller to. The needles are very sharp! I have only used this one a couple times but so far to me its pretty much pain free just the usual sun burn feel for few hours after using it. My skins complexion is looking better though. My scars less noticeable on my face. I think next i will try my stretch marks on my tummy from my 3 kids. I received this item in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Call me crazy, but I absolutely love the way this feels on my face. I find it extremely relaxing! This came shipped in a sterile and sealed container. It feels and looks of great quality. I The derma roller is really great when combined with serums. This will really allow your serums to work themselves into your skin deeper and get you maximum results. This is the next step up in your beautify routine. If you want to get the results of those expensive serums this Derma Roller is a must! I love that this also come with a snap case over just the roller part itself because it is easier to store as well.</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected and have since figured out that I need numbing cream and human growth hormones for it to be effective.  It comes with no instructions at al which from what i have researched can injure your skin if you don&#x27;t do it properly. I&#x27;m dissatisfied with this.</li>
    <li> truly cannot recommend this roller highly enough. The first few weeks after I received it, I was not seeing the results I had hoped and was feeling disappointed with this product. However, after reading more information about derma rollers and how they&#x27;re supposed to be used, I am amazed at the results!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had stretch marks on my inner thighs for as long as I can remember, so I decided that would be my testing spot. I would roll the derma roller over my inner thighs about 1-2x a week I recommend this product 100%. Just make sure you do your homework: read up on derma rollers and how they work and you will definitely see results! :)</li>
    <li> Thank you for speed you  good</li>
    <li> I like how the item came insulated in plastic for sanitation purposes. Very sleek looking and easy to handle. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is an effective beauty tool!  What I like best about it is that it&#x27;s not another lotion or serum.  I use this before I shower or wash my face.  I have found that if I use it afterwards then, I&#x27;m too sensitive.  It&#x27;s all about the pressure you apply to our own skin.  I don&#x27;t apply much pressure until my skin adjusts to it.  I also apply less pressure around the tender areas.  It says to not share it, but my 14 year old does use it on his forehead.  We sanitize it before and after each use.  It&#x27;s not pain free and at times it&#x27;s not comfortable, but it does the job it&#x27;s designed to do.  If you follow the directions and use your own good judgment, it will work for you too.</li>
