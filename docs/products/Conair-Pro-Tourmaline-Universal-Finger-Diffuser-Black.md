      <li>Yes, it will kind of do the job, but it does nothing to separate curls and causes frizziness.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t like the kind of curls I get with it.</li>
      <li>I have a shelf that I then put it onto, but just fair warning that the top is very hot.</li>

      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Bought after original diffuser cracked- fits perfectly over my old hair dryer.</li>
      <li>It works great once you really force it to fit, it kept sliding off at first but now fits good</li>
      <li>It has good air flow and works really well.</li>
      <li>This was my first experience with a diffuser, and I love it!</li>
      <li>It fits my Conair Infiniti Pro just fine.</li>
      <li>I use it with my BabyBliss, fits fine.</li>
      <li>I think it doesn&#x27;t fit all the models.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t fit mine.</li>
      <li>It fit my BabylissPro TT 3300.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to order this not knowing if it would fit my hairdryer.</li>
      <li>Amazon came up with an asinine plan to &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; me that was WAY more hassle than it was worth.</li>
      <li>Tried using this diffuser with BaByliss Pro BABP2800 Porcelain Ceramic 2000-Watt Dryer and it would initially fit, but would fall off while in use.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit my Conair hair dryer.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit the Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Dryer.</li>
      <li>I have a Conair 204P hair dryer and this \\&quot;universal\\&quot; diffuser, by Conair, didn&#x27;t fit on my dryer.</li>
      <li>It fit my mother&#x27;s Bed Head hair dryer which has a thinner nose, so I&#x27;m guessing that is the problem.</li>
      <li>The diffuser arrived yesterday, and although it does indeed fit on the dryer, it does not stay on when the dryer is on.  </li>
      <li>Nor will it fit on either of my housemates&#x27; dryers.</li>
      <li>Several months in &amp; still works great (and by this time I&#x27;m usally dealing with cracks in a difuser).</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t fit from the day it arrived and the hotter the dryer gets, the faster it falls off.  </li>
      <li>have a conair dryer which this product said it would fit on, so</li>
      <li>I received a prompt reply from a customer service rep that recommended this diffuser (model CPTMD3), along with another one that I could not find available to buy anywhere.  </li>
      <li>so of course I thought it would fit</li>
      <li>I have curly/wavy hair, frizz free</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my conair ionshine 1875.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my Conair Infiniti hair dryer.</li>
      <li>It has fit on my Babyliss and Conair 225NP hair dryers.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fit either of my dryers</li>
      <li>It fit over the barrel of my Andis 82005</li>
      <li>very frustration.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!!!</li>
      <li>would suggest that get this only if your really sure this will work for you !!</li>
      <li>Low air, high heat - gives me great waves!  </li>
      <li>i have a Babyliss Nano Titanium Pro and it fits very well, and has nice little rubber grippy bits inside to help make the hold more secure so it won&#x27;t fly off with use.</li>
      <li>Definitely WORTH the money!   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the &amp;#34;tourmaline&amp;#34; but the diffuser is great!</li>
      <li>It fits nicely over my dryer, as I&#x27;m guessing it will over most, and the red piece inside is made of metal which heats up to help the styling along.    </li>
      <li>however once it heated up it kept popping right off and flew across the room!  </li>
      <li>I was nervous about the fit--but the price was right!  </li>
      <li>I bought this from another vendor and thought it was a good deal, since it&#x27;s universal and was under $7.</li>
      <li>So I ordered it, fully expecting that it would work great and that I would not have the problems that other reviewers here have mentioned.  </li>
      <li>This shipped realitively quickly.</li>
      <li>While I can avoid touching it with my skin, I do not want this kind of heat on my wet hair.</li>
      <li>The diffuser melted both the hair dryer &amp; itself the very first time I used it.</li>
      <li>I tried to make the Diffuser fit as much as I could.</li>
      <li>I purchased this diffuser because it claimed to be a universal fit to most blow dryers.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews for this one and for several others on Amazon, and many of them mention that the diffuser didn&#x27;t fit whatever dryer the reviewers were using.  </li>
      <li>and it TOTALLY worth it.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, the cost it took to buy this (since I didn&#x27;t want to get the cheaper ones on the site, scared it may not work) made the cost of buying a universal one inefficient...</li>
      <li>I bought this 3 weeks ago and so far I am satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>This one is kind of bulky, but I don&#x27;t see how that would be avoidable given it is trying to fit on a variety of nozzles and is diffusing air over a wide surface area.</li>
      <li>To take it off the top part is VERY hot, but the part that is over the hairdryer is cool enough to touch.</li>
      <li>My curly hair drys quickly without frizz, a first for me.</li>
      <li>While this might be a great diffuser, it is NOT, as other reviews have mentioned, a universal fit.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it with my BabyBliss, fits fine. Several months in &amp; still works great (and by this time I&#x27;m usally dealing with cracks in a difuser). But this one is holding up great!</li>
    <li> makes beautiful curls for me :)</li>
    <li> This product says \\&quot;universal fit\\&quot; and it has a small degree of flexibility in the area where you push it on to your dryer. But a big WARNING -- even if it fits, it doesn&#x27;t stay on.  The parts that make contact with the dryer are hard plastic with only tiny nubs of hard rubber -- there&#x27;s not nearly enough friction to keep it on a dryer even if it does fit. Force it on, get a snug fit, and it pops right back off.    I used it on an Andis dryer and it is completely useless. Junk. I threw it away. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about the fit--but the price was right!  It fits my ceramix xtreme babyliss pro perfectly!  It hasn&#x27;t fallen off once, and I take it off all the time.  This was my first experience with a diffuser, and I love it! Makes perfect bouncy curls with no frizz :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this 3 weeks ago and so far I am satisfied with it. My thick wavy curly hair dries in 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I have very little frizz when I am done and my curls come out amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My diffuser has not popped off my dryer yet but I don&#x27;t detach it at all I just leave it on the dryer constantly.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that my hair does not come out looking like a lions mane with volume. It tones down the volume which is what I need.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend who has thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> I like the diffuser,  but it destroyed the end of my hairdryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this several times and it just doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as my old one does. I really wish it did so that I could throw my other hair dryer away.</li>
    <li> Really annoyed with this product. Especially because it&#x27;s the brand ConAir, the same exact brand as my hairdryer. I looked at the product description and I thought something is supposed to \\&quot;snap\\&quot; -- well, it doesn&#x27;t, unless it&#x27;s the side of the product splitting in two. The way this diffuser works is that is has stretchy rubber on the inside, in a cone like shape, that&#x27;s supposed to stretch out and grab onto the dryer. Except the rubber isn&#x27;t grippy enough, and actually has no grips to speak of. So the diffuser slides right back out, and often ended up dropping onto my toe or making a mess of my bathroom when it fell. I thought if I pushed it down far enough it would stay, but alas, when I was blowdrying my hair, it constantly fell off, no matter how hard I pushed it on. And this is when I ended up cracking the product.  Don&#x27;t buy this. Just get a diffuser that matches up with your hairdryer. Or try that sock diffuser.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this universal diffuser was not compatible with any of my hair dryers. I also had a Conair 1875 and it didn&#x27;t click/snap into place. I tried to shove it on so that the rubber elastic would \\&quot;snap\\&quot; into place, however the blow dryer ended up melting and snapping off the rubber band. I tried to re-wrap the rubber band however there was no fixing it. Honestly, the cost it took to buy this (since I didn&#x27;t want to get the cheaper ones on the site, scared it may not work) made the cost of buying a universal one inefficient... I ended up finding a 20% off coupon to Kohls and bought a new blow dryer with attachable diffuser and concentrator for $18. Definitely WORTH the money!   I do say I did get this in a short period! I did two day shipping and ended up getting it in one. Hopefully someone else has more luck than I did!</li>
    <li> I think this diffuser could work great if I could get it to stay on my Conair dryer.  I would not consider this diffuser \\&quot;universal\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this not knowing if it would fit my hairdryer. I took the chance and purchased it and it fits just fine on my Paul Mitchell hair dryer although I have to push it on tightly or it will loosen. My curly hair drys quickly without frizz, a first for me. I wanted the Curly Girl Diffuser but they are being redesigned for 2012 so I thought I would get this one and use until the new one came out. I think I&#x27;ll save my money and stick with this.</li>
    <li> I have a Conair 204P hair dryer and this \\&quot;universal\\&quot; diffuser, by Conair, didn&#x27;t fit on my dryer. It fit my mother&#x27;s Bed Head hair dryer which has a thinner nose, so I&#x27;m guessing that is the problem. You have to have a thin-nosed dryer for it to work. I&#x27;m so mad that it says \\&quot;universal\\&quot; and \\&quot;fits most dryers\\&quot; and it didn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer that is by the same maker.</li>
    <li> While this might be a great diffuser, it is NOT, as other reviews have mentioned, a universal fit. Even on my Conair 1875 hair dryer, which is the same brand as the diffuser, this diffuser would not stay on. Too bad, because I was looking forward to it.</li>
    <li> it does what it says. For the price and convenience and speed of drying my hair, I have zero complaints. for those who say it is too big and falls off their existing dryer, stuff some foam, a sock, or some paper towels in the gap that might exist. (on my dryer there is no gap)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several of these &amp; like them a lot. I have short, fine hair that is curly in places and wavy in others; I use product to enhance the curl, and after drying with a diffuser the curls usually hold up. The cup design of this diffuser controls airflow well to concentrate it on the area of your head that you&#x27;re working on - and the air then doesn&#x27;t blow around the curls outside that area. However the air is still a bit windy even on low flow settings (the holes that allow air to pass through are a bit large). I like the red tourmaline piece, seems to make it work better than similar diffusers I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it isn&#x27;t very durable. It fit my hairdryer pretty well, but the thick rubber band (that encircles the prongs inside that grip the dryer) weakens with age and in my case eventually broke completely. The first one lasted almost two years (with 2 people using it) but the second one lasted less than a year. At least it&#x27;s a small investment. I&#x27;m now in the market for a new dryer, and will likely buy one that has its own diffuser.</li>
    <li> Lots of people complaining about the fit and no one makes a comment on the actual size of the opening-break out a tape measure and include something helpful in your review.</li>
    <li> Love this. Made the natural waves of my hair come out</li>
    <li> Gave this to my girlfriend and it broke while she was using it for the first time.  Even though it is a ConAir universal diffuse...it can&#x27;t even grip the ConAir blow dryer that she was using.  Now it just falls off every time you put it on.  Its about to fall off into the trash.</li>
    <li> This product works rather well; my hair is awesomely curly afterward. However, it does have a tendency to pop off of my Conair hair dryer. Not to the point that it&#x27;s unusable and I want to throw it, but enough that it&#x27;s an annoyance.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser, it fits on my multiple blow dryers I have one that is a very small travel blow dryer and a large one at home. It works well on both of them. I&#x27;m not sure about the &amp;#34;tourmaline&amp;#34; but the diffuser is great!</li>
    <li> Product works great on my hairdryer I have at home. But, I purchased it for use at my gym M-F and it is too narrow to fit on my hairdryer there. Bummer.    So, aside from the not fitting issue, its a great diffuser, but be careful if you have a wider hairdryer nozzle.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, wavy hair. I bought this because when I blow-dry my hair without a diffuser, my hair gets straightened out and a bit frizzy. With this, it&#x27;s wavy, full of body, and much less frizzy. Does work best when you take the extra time needed to dry on low speed and low heat. But it will work at higher temp and speed.</li>
    <li> Great pricing. Awesome product quality. Fast shipping. Will do business again.</li>
    <li> I have several blow dryers.This Diffuser did not fit any of them.I tried to make the Diffuser fit as much as I could.I even tried to holld it with my hand.Did not work at all.I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> This was the first diffuser I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It lasted about a year. I had to stop using it because the plastic grippers inside became over headed over time and no longer provided any tension to hold it to the blow dryer. That didn&#x27;t stop me! ... at first. Being cheap, I continued to use it by just balancing it on my blow dryer, but I eventually got frustrated and gave it up. I&#x27;ve tried a few diffusers since then and none of them compare to this one.&lt;br /&gt;This left my hair soft and shiny and with very little frizz. I have curly/wavy hair, frizz free is an impossibility I&#x27;ve learned to accept. The tourmaline plate at the bottom is the best part. It REALLY helps dry my hair fast! I have hair down to the small of my back. With that much hair, speed is always a plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this only lasted a year the first time around I&#x27;m hoping my new blow dryer doesn&#x27;t melt it quite as fast this time. But because of the results after using it and how it helped speed up my hair drying time I will DEFINITELY be buying another one ASAP!</li>
    <li> I purchased this diffuser because it claimed to be a universal fit to most blow dryers.  It fit over the barrel of my Andis 82005 however once it heated up it kept popping right off and flew across the room!  I returned the product.....</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that without using this it would be an unruly mess.  This fits any hairdryer so it&#x27;s very convenient!</li>
    <li> It fits nicely over my dryer, as I&#x27;m guessing it will over most, and the red piece inside is made of metal which heats up to help the styling along.    I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Among other reasons, often people dry with a diffuser so they can wear their wavy/curly hair natural and avoid the damage that comes with flat ironing it daily. I feel like this product defeats the purpose of that. Knowing it has tourmaline technology sounds great, except when you consider that the red plate in the middle gets extremely hot. After a couple of minutes, it becomes scalding hot to the touch. While I can avoid touching it with my skin, I do not want this kind of heat on my wet hair. There is a reason it&#x27;s bad to flat iron when your hair is wet (it will fry it) and while the plate in this may not get up to 450 degrees like some flat irons, if I can&#x27;t touch it without scalding myself, I&#x27;m not putting my wet hair on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know anything on the end of a blowdryer is going to get heated up. But this gets way hotter than other diffusers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, this is *without* using it on high heat, which it says not to. This is using it on my low heat/low speed setting. And I have tried it with two completely different brands of hair dryers.</li>
    <li> Lager than I expected, but works well and is fine.</li>
    <li> when I bought Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Dryer, the website show can buy this Finger Diffuser together, therefore I bought it together, when we received both products, we find these two can not fit each other at all. I don&#x27;t understand why the website put them together to sell, since it not fit each other, or at time we purchase, they should let us know these two not fit each other, or suggest us which dryer can use/fit this Finger Diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;Now I really want know which hair dry can fit this finger diffuser? otherwise this is totally waste our money and time.</li>
    <li> I prefer this shape of diffuser to the ones with the longer fingers. I have another conair diffuser attachment with longer fingers and I don&#x27;t like the kind of curls I get with it. This one is kind of bulky, but I don&#x27;t see how that would be avoidable given it is trying to fit on a variety of nozzles and is diffusing air over a wide surface area. This diffuser gives me the best and most defined curls. It has fit on my Babyliss and Conair 225NP hair dryers. I would recommend it to a friend since I am happy with it. I have not tried a whole bunch of diffusers to have a great basis of comparison though.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is not a universal fit. I have a science tools blow dryer and this diffuser wouldn&#x27;t even stay on my dryer well enough for me to even attempt to use it.</li>
    <li> I have never used a finger diffuser before and this worked very well without drying my hair out however, for being universal I do struggle to fit it properly everytime I use it on the blow dryer i have.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my Conair Infiniti hair dryer. I was pretty bummed since I have been looking for a diffuser attachment.</li>
    <li> Great buy! I&#x27;m a curly girl and this diffuser is similar to the one my stylist used when giving me my Diva Cut!</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Didn&#x27;t fit my conair ionshine 1875. For $7 more you can buy a revlon dryer which comes with 2 attachments including a diffuser...that will be guaranteed to work.</li>
    <li> I hate to give things three stars, but the other reviewers got it right- solid three stars. This is because if you want a diffuser like I did, and you don&#x27;t want to buy a whole new blow dryer, you basically have to find a universal fit one. So, it fits, but it does fall off about five times per use. Not the end of the world, sort of annoying, but still does the job.</li>
    <li> Fit on my new conair blow dryer well and hasn&#x27;t popped off once yet. Just wished the conair dryer stated it came with a similar type attachment and I wouldn&#x27;t of needed this one, but this one is nicer.</li>
    <li> The delivery was on-time and everything was perfect, except that the diffuser dint work for me.&lt;br /&gt;It says universal, yet I think it doesn&#x27;t fit all the models.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that get this only if your really sure this will work for you !!</li>
    <li> This is nice tool when you want to minimize the amount of heat and stress you put on your locks and at a few bucks it wont set you back too much.</li>
    <li> I have a conair hairdryer so of course I thought it would fit but it didn&#x27;t.  I am returning it : (  I should have listened to the other reviews but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I will bring my dryer to a beauty supply store to e sure I purchase the correct one next time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my dryer!!!</li>
    <li> I have had this for a month or two now and while it works, i feel like it could break at anytime.  Also just something to note - this does not &#x27;click&#x27; onto the lip of the hair dryer as diffuses that have come with other hairdryers i bought have in the past.  You have to slide, really push, this onto the hairdryer where it then sits.  To take it off the top part is VERY hot, but the part that is over the hairdryer is cool enough to touch. I have a shelf that I then put it onto, but just fair warning that the top is very hot.</li>
    <li> It was much bigger than I had expected, but I kept it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, it was tight on my hair dryer, but then it started to fall-off. Curly hair are a bit &amp;#34;sturdier&amp;#34; than straight hair (which is a blessing when you want to stick hair clips etc), but then the diffuser will not glide through your hair. You have to dry a section, take it out of your hair, and insert it another part of your head. Even then, sometimes the diffuser will come off the dryer and you have to fit it back.</li>
    <li> Been using every day for years and it works perfectly at creating lots of curls and volume!  (It&#x27;s not MAGIC.... you have to have curly hair to get curls, but this really helps them to POP!)</li>
    <li> I have had the diffuser for two weeks and pretty much have burned my head a few times. There is no way that I can have my blow dryer on high due to the red center heating up too much.  I tried blow drying my hair on medium and with the thick curly hair that I have, it was taking forever and coming out frizzy.  I would go with one of the other Conair options.</li>
    <li> I bought this to be used with a Conair hair dryer, and it won&#x27;t stay on.  Nor will it fit on either of my housemates&#x27; dryers. Despite its claim to be universal, I have yet to find a hair dryer it actually works with, and after it fell onto my head multiple times during use, I gave up.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a basic diffuser that fits most stands rd hair dryers. Nothing fancy but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Do NOT think this is universal. I have a Conair dryer and when I attach, and use it on the lowest setting it blows off within 30 seconds!</li>
    <li> gentle on the curls if you have curly hair and are sick and tired of wet hair this is the dryer attachment you must have.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and fits my blow dryer perfectly.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOVE it, but for some reason i feel like it takes longer than my last diffuser at my salon? Oh well still love it. Works great, looks great, fits great.</li>
    <li> This is advertised as a universal fit for all Conair hair dryers.  Not true.  It doesn&#x27;t fit the Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Dryer.</li>
    <li> I like it and use it, but the only problem is it sometimes will konk you on the head when it decides to fall off during use.</li>
    <li> Please note that currently, the photo and the description do not match. Reviews and the picture indicate that it is Connair brand. Title descripton indicates Babyliss. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I loved it for about a week, and then it started falling off my hairdryer when I was drying my hair. (It&#x27;s an Ion.) Then the red metal piece fell out. I tried to rig the metal piece back on there and bend it with a screwdriver to make it stay, and so far it is. But after two days of taking forever to dry my hair due to the whole thing falling off repeatedly, here I am looking for a new diffuser on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The diffuser melted both the hair dryer &amp; itself the very first time I used it. Needless to say, I threw it away. I would not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I have a conair dryer and this still wouldn&#x27;t stay on. I tried to hold it on to at least try and get my hair dry but it go too hot and just kept falling off. This thing sucks!!</li>
    <li> Tried using this diffuser with BaByliss Pro BABP2800 Porcelain Ceramic 2000-Watt Dryer and it would initially fit, but would fall off while in use. This makes it a potential burn hazard since the red metal part gets hot while in use.</li>
    <li> They did send me the wrong one .. Thats why they have a 4 star rating , but the one they did send which was the babyliss pro Diffuser , WHICH FITS THE CONAIR 1875 blow dryer .. AMAZING ! They give my curls body without frizz and also gives it a dryer looking curl without the crunch-y ness (if you know what i mean) sadly it doesnt fit my conair 1875 quiet tone but still great diffuser !</li>
    <li> Does teh job as promised. Fits snuggly on hairdryer.</li>
    <li> It says it fits most hair dryers but it didn&#x27;t fit mine. I had to return it and now I&#x27;m looking for a new one.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer. Conair Infiniti Pro</li>
    <li> It fit my BabylissPro TT 3300. It was a shot in the dark because I couldn&#x27;t find specs on what diffuser to use ANYWHERE. Happy it worked out!</li>
    <li> This shipped realitively quickly. Diffuser is a lot larger than I thought it would be, and fits pretty snug on my hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Says &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; but did not fit my CONAIR blowdryer! Same brand!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Fits my hair dryer.  I use it just before my hair is totally air dried.  Low air, high heat - gives me great waves!  Don&#x27;t use any products other than moisturizing serum.</li>
    <li> First of all this seller did not describe the product correctly. It is not universal. It doesn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer because the nozzle is way too big for my Conair dryer. What a waste of money :(</li>
    <li> Not the same brand. It is not universal for all dryers.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent fit on my blow dryer and it never falls off!! It has good air flow and works really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to echo other reviewers here and say that although this says it is &amp;#34;universal fit,&amp;#34; it is definitely NOT. I (like other reviewers) thought, &amp;#34;well, I have a conair blow dryer so surely it has to fit!&amp;#34; I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t diffuse my hair every day, I don&#x27;t mind holding it on to the dryer while using it. It doesn&#x27;t get too hot to handle unless I turn my dryer up to the hottest setting.</li>
    <li> fit fine on blowdryer, however as i&#x27;ve read from other reviews. it does not stay on if you go above low speed; even then if you keep it on low an it meets any resistence as when you put it against your hair .........it pops off the end of the blowdryer!!! Making the product useless!! I ended up buying a whole new blowdryer that came with a diffuser.</li>
    <li> This works great. It fits my Conair Infiniti Pro just fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a new hair dryer because it popped up automatically as \\&quot;Frequently Brought Together\\&quot; (and the hair dryer didn&#x27;t come with one). It fits the dryer fine, but it is huge (and I&#x27;ve had other diffusers before). It practically doubles the size of the dryer and would be nearly impossible to occasionally travel with. I wish I had spent a bit more and bought the same brand as the dryer, which I assume would just snap onto the end and not take up so much extra space.</li>
    <li> This was a terrible product!  It broke the first time I used it; some of the parts that hold it onto the hair dryer broke, then I tried to at least get some use out of it, the parts of it melted.  I have a Conair hair dryer and this item wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34;...The seller refused to replace it even though it was only 3 months old; I didn&#x27;t use it the first 2 months.  I would NEVER buy from this seller again!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product comes nowhere near fitting my  new Babyliss hair dryer- \\&quot;BaByliss Pro BABP2800 Porcelain Ceramic 2000-Watt Dryer, Black\\&quot;. Nothing universal about it! plus it&#x27;s a Conaire product!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! Doesn&#x27;t blow my hair around and make it all frizzy. Locks my curls in and doesn&#x27;t get too hot either.</li>
    <li> After looking for a long time for a diffuser I purchased this one and I hate it. It said it was a &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; diffuser but it doesn&#x27;t fit my Conair hair dryer.</li>
    <li> My daughter has naturally curly hair that the curls always get tangled in themselves. With this diffuser it helps separate them, and gives her the softest fullest curls. Cuts down on dry time by half. It fits perfectly on my conair infiniti pro hair dryer. Best hair diffuser I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> This was in the middle between the other 2 diffusers i bought, but i kept this one becuase its the only one that sort of fit my dryer. It still pops off too often, so i have to hold it, but its the only one that would at least stay on for me to hold on to. I cant blame the maker since my dryer is a high end and small niche maker \\&quot;j&#x27;bere\\&quot; and has grooves that make it hard to find attachments for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffusers was very inexpensive and worth keeping for the price. The bowl was large enough to hold most of my hair. My hair is thick and long and goes to below my chest. It works as it should. I really need a diffuser so since its the only that sort of worked, I like it.</li>
    <li> Works well. Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> This is truly a universal fit. There are little prongs that can handle any sized blowdryer. I am truly satisfied.</li>
    <li> This diffuser was recommended for my  BaByliss Pro BABP2800 Porcelain Ceramic 2000-Watt Dryer. What a terrible recommendation! It stays on the dryer between 1-4 seconds. It hasn&#x27;t fit from the day it arrived and the hotter the dryer gets, the faster it falls off.  DO NOT BUY THIS DIFFUSER for the above mentioned dryer!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good but could be better!  It&#x27;s a little loose in my blow dryer.But I&#x27;ll get used to it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Where the diffuser connects to the dyer it has moveable pieces inside to fit different size dyers.&lt;br /&gt;So at first you will think it fits on your dyer but with in 15sec it pops off.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a few time with the dryer pointing up with the diffuser just balancing, not worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;I have a conair dryer which this product said it would fit on, so very frustration.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> I have a conair dryer, and the diffuser does pop off every once in a while, but if I stick on well enough, it works pretty well and it TOTALLY worth it.  I love this diffuser, it is big, easy and ACTUALLY works like a diffuser should rather than the ones I&#x27;ve gotten with hair dryers.  (I have shoulder-length, 3a curls.)</li>
    <li> Fits my Conair hair dryer I got a Costco, but it does not reduce the air flow well so I can only use it on low.</li>
    <li> It works great once you really force it to fit, it kept sliding off at first but now fits good and I just leave it on my dryer! Which is an older conair...</li>
    <li> Warped after 2 uses. Did not use high or hot settings. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> No complaints about theshiping got it when i should but it does not fit all hair dryer that are con air</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in beauty school now and needed this. Tip: Cosmo prof has them cheaper!</li>
    <li> The description provided online said it would fit on my current blowdryer.  NOT the case.  After running dryer less then 5 mins it kept falling off.  Instead of going through the hassle of returning and shipping it back, I used black duct type. :-/</li>
    <li> It was and is advertised as universal but it doesn&#x27;t fit either of my dryers</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Girl friend and she loves it and she say it works really good!! Def. a good gift!!</li>
    <li> I love it fits my turbo 1500 blower does a wonderful job .... It really defines the curls</li>
    <li> i have a Babyliss Nano Titanium Pro and it fits very well, and has nice little rubber grippy bits inside to help make the hold more secure so it won&#x27;t fly off with use.</li>
    <li> Is not universal fit, and came to me defective and u didn&#x27;t get a full refund. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This item did not fit my hair dryer. It isn&#x27;t worth anything, much less the price that it&#x27;s advertised for in the ad.</li>
    <li> Bought after original diffuser cracked- fits perfectly over my old hair dryer. Just need to push hard to engage a tight fit.</li>
    <li> I mean, it may be a good diffuser, but I wouldn&#x27;t know because it&#x27;s definitely not universal. They should add a little asterisk at the end that says &amp;#34;universal only for conair blow dryers.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works great to build volume.</li>
    <li> I bought this from another vendor and thought it was a good deal, since it&#x27;s universal and was under $7. First of all, it&#x27;s cheap plastic that doesn&#x27;t feel as sturdy as other diffuser attachments. Second, it constantly blows off the dryer in the middle of drying the hair, even on low. That&#x27;s really annoying. Yes, it will kind of do the job, but it does nothing to separate curls and causes frizziness. Third, it&#x27;s a bulky and awkward shape making it difficult to work with. I can&#x27;t wait to replace it.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the BaByliss Pro BABTTW5586 TT Tourmaline Titanium 5000 Dryer.  I have been happy with it, except that I think spending that much on a dryer ought to mean that it comes with a diffuser.  But no problem, there are lots of diffusers to be found.  I read the reviews for this one and for several others on Amazon, and many of them mention that the diffuser didn&#x27;t fit whatever dryer the reviewers were using.  So I went to the company site for my dryer, BaByliss Pro, and emailed customer service with the name/model # of my dryer and asked which diffuser I should buy.  I received a prompt reply from a customer service rep that recommended this diffuser (model CPTMD3), along with another one that I could not find available to buy anywhere.  So I ordered it, fully expecting that it would work great and that I would not have the problems that other reviewers here have mentioned.  Well, I was wrong.  The diffuser arrived yesterday, and although it does indeed fit on the dryer, it does not stay on when the dryer is on.  I am returning it, and I am pretty pissed off because I went out of my way to ask specifically for the model number of a diffuser that would work with my dryer, only to be steered wrong by the BaByliss/Conair (same company) people.  I am also going to find a new professional dryer and return this one, even though I like the dryer, because this is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Received the wrong product. Seller referred me to amazon, saying they couldn&#x27;t help since amazon fulfilled the order. Amazon came up with an asinine plan to &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; me that was WAY more hassle than it was worth. Decided to try this diffuser and it was AWFUL. Don&#x27;t buy! Save your money and buy a better one elsewhere!!</li>
