<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite Aftershave Balm. You only need a drop to cover your face. It smells great too.  I wish they made a shower gel.</li>
    <li> Great aftershave lotion. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Poppa, he loves PS. I loved the price.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Makes great gifts</li>
    <li> THE MOST FABULOUS SMELL ON EARTH.  I had a customer come in that had this one and immediately asked him what is was so I could get it for my husband.</li>
    <li> The scent was different, hardly any at all.  The consistency was not what it used to be.  Either the formula was changed or I received a counterfeit product.</li>
    <li> Ordered this as a gift. It was exactly what they wanted. Great price, fast delivery, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not a genuine Paul Sebstian product, I have been using the after shave balm since 1997 and never had a problem with the quality of the product or the pump. This defenetly a counterfeit product made by an unreliable source. I will try to return the bottle I just started and another one in the original package. The only reason I gave it one star is because they came in but what a disappointment. Pure trash from the producer. Attached are two pics; the one on the left is an original PJ with the right pump and color, the one on the right has a different pump shape and doesn&#x27;t work, and the color is much lighter and the smell is very soft not like the original and genuine PJ product.</li>
    <li> Not what I remember the scent to be. I used to get this for my husband years ago and now it smells cheap. I won&#x27;t reorder. I should have known by the price.</li>
    <li> I think i loss my money to buy something like this bad smell i dont no why i buy aftershaving frome amazon next time i will smell my after shaving and after that a i will spend my money</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and love it.</li>
    <li> A son deserves the best. I bought this for the recent birthday. The gift came promptly and he was thrilled.</li>
    <li> The after shave balm works just ok but the fragrance almost stinks. It smells really cheap for the price. [[ASIN:B000C1W2KS Paul Sebastian By Paul Sebastian For Men. Aftershave Lotion 4 Ounces]]. Oh well, I took a chance.</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding.  I prefer it to the lotion and have been unable to find it in department stores.  Most department stores only carry the lotion.</li>
    <li> Liquid hardens before fully used so plunger sticks.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff.  ONE  PROBLEM, however.  The spigot tube going into the bottle is not long enough to access more than 3/4 of the bottle.  If it was a little longer the pump would work much better and we wouldn&#x27;t be left with a quarter bottle potentially wasted.  I have taken the pump off and just shake the balm out.  I like the balm a lot and use it even on my head when I&#x27;m wearing a ball cap.  The cap doesn&#x27;t get that stale smell.</li>
    <li> Great product hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years and am happy with the product and the service provided by Amazon in supplying the product and price.    E.M.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the cologne- my husband loved it! Lotion is nice texture and not over powering. Great gift too!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product but it is very strongly scented.  I use just a dab and cut it with some water otherwise I feel like anyone within 50 feet can smell me.</li>
    <li> Great product, I would suggest it for&lt;br /&gt;any man who shaves. Really does smell great,&lt;br /&gt;and helps smooth the skin. I like it.</li>
    <li> Not so it is pleasant. Very strong smell of cologne. Not the beautiful kind of a bottle also costs much. In the future I will buy only brands known to me.</li>
    <li> At first smell, the cinnamon was nice but seemed a bit strong. Upon actually using the product, the smell was overwhelming. I do apply my after shave balm to my entire face and neck as a moisturizer, so it is possible that a lesser application would be fine. In my case the smell, combined with the thickness of the lotion was too much.</li>
    <li> fragrance is ok not what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I have used this shave Baum for years. Try it, you will like!  Wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I will certainly re-order from you. This is the only after shave that I use. I am extremely happy over my savings.</li>
    <li> Feels great and a lil&#x27; bit will do the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now and still love it. Not only does it smell great but the lotion is very soothing after shaving. You can buy it here for 1/4 to 1/3 the price in department stores which is a huge plus as well. -</li>
    <li> Comfortable, cooling going on, and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy.  Very pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> Ditto my above comment! Both products are upper crust quality in my opinion! This is the only product line that does not grow stronger after application. It is also light in scent all day!</li>
    <li> At he department store this sells for over $30 per bottle (If they have it at all)  This is all my husband and son-in-law will wear.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> Husband&#x27;s 1st choice  mine for him too</li>
    <li> This stuff is potent and smells like an old man&#x27;s barber shop.  I thought it was worth trying after reading the reviews, but my significant other can&#x27;t stand the smell of me when I wear this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a scent for the older crowd....nothing strong, just a gentlemen&#x27;s scent..great balm.</li>
    <li> I have been using PS for about 25 years.  It is southing, cool never burn, with a great fragrance!  My wife loves it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love when my husband wears this scent - it is very subtle and for me is so very sexy!  Does something to my insides!!  :)</li>
    <li> Smooth and a very nice viscosity for a pump.  Aroma is similar to Old Spice, at least to me.  After this had been consumed, I&#x27;ll try one more brand before I decide to stick with this one for good.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I got the aftershave quickly and was surprised by how good it smells. It&#x27;s a strong scent, catches people&#x27;s nose easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong, bold and confident with notes of ferns. Very nice pick up!</li>
    <li> This smells so good, my husband (and I!) both love it. So fresh and clean smelling. I would definately order again!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this balm. He likes the way if moisturizes he skin without leaving a heavy lotion feeling. It also smells great. I bought this along with several other Paul Sebastian products from Amazon. They were much less expensive than the in the department stores, smell great, &amp; were delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Best $10 you could ever spend on an aftershave.  This balm soothes and moisturizes. The scent is soft and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is a little musky and yet clean.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It was a better deal at $11.95 at the current price of $14.95 it&#x27;s not worth it.It smells ok but does contain alcohol.I could just as easily visit Walmart and buy a Nivea product that is more soothing,cheaper and is alcohol free.Smells like a clean scent,a little sweet but still masculine.</li>
    <li> I have used PS cologne for many years and love the fragrance. This aftershave has a very similar fragrance and for this reason I rate the product 5 stars. My skin is oily and this product is more of a balm or lotion and it make my face feel more oily; but this is just me. I like this product and expect purchase again when. And finally, I have not found this aftershave in local store and the price is excellent for a PS product.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance. A great soothing way to apply a post shave lotion, without the sting of a traditional aftershave lotion.</li>
    <li> A very good product for a very reasonable price. The quality was good and it was as it appeared. Would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I rate this aftershave balm(prefer balms to just aftershaves-no sting after shaving) a 5 star because after using it for approximately 10 years it&#x27;s still the same(and it smells so good especially to the opposite sex). It&#x27;s a winner in my book,</li>
    <li> As always a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this scent!  My husband gets compliments every time he wears it.</li>
    <li> B using PS for 20 plus years and still get compliments almost weekly.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  Great lotion.</li>
    <li> Has a great smell, and several ladies have mentioned they enjoy the smell when I wear it.  It also feels so cooling and comforting after a good shave!</li>
    <li> Almost impossible to find Aftershave balm in any type stores--my husband is very greatful I found it on line.  They carry everything but the balm.</li>
    <li> Never use anything else, clean fresh smell</li>
    <li> I have been using PS aftershave Balm probably 15 years. I obviously like it. I get lots of compliments on the scent, from the ladies.</li>
    <li> I have been using PS cologne for years but recently decided to try the balm. Its very soothing to the skin after shaving and what i really like is that its not greasy at all. Seems to absorb and settle in quickly and the only thing left behind is smooth skin and a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The best aftershave balm I know.  Remarkable aroma...so everyone tells me.</li>
    <li> I have been using the PS after shave balm for many years and it is my favorite to say the least.</li>
    <li> My spouse really loves this product he likes how it feels on his skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find after shave balms which I think are 10 times better than regular alcohol based aftershaves.  I tried this one based on the reviews and am glad I did. It&#x27;s also the le least expensive balm per once I found and my wife loves the way it smells on me.</li>
    <li> Glad to be able to find this product again.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> The product is equivalent to the original purchased from the local department store. I would buy this aftershave product again.</li>
    <li> been a paul sebastian person for many , many years . an excellent product ..will use till not produced any more,&lt;br /&gt;use deoderant also ..wish they bring back tacl</li>
    <li> Great smell for men and great on your face.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fabulous. It smells fantastic, and it feels great. As a balm it is fantastic, soothing and smoothing with the best of them. It is my #1 choice after trying more than 20. So why only four stars? The bottle is *terrible*!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the pump tube only reaches down about 2/3 of the way into the bottle, so for the last 1/3, the pump is useless. Given how little you need with each use, that bottom 1/3 might result in months of frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the bottle is square, so when you inevitably turn the bottle over to shake the rest out, you&#x27;ll have to work very hard to get the final bits out because it will be stuck in the corners. Meanwhile the useless pump will have slick balm all over it, and that will now be on the counter making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, because the bottle is square and the product is *just* thick enough, simply turning the bottle upside down on top of another bottle (think ketchup bottles in restaurants) won&#x27;t work because the product will be stuck in the corners of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a resounding 10. The bottle and pump are about a zero. If P&amp;S fixes even just the length of the tube on the pump, this would be a grand-slam. Hell, just delivering it in a tube instead of a pump would solve the problem!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this after shave balm and was so glad to find it for him online. It has become scarce in department stores.</li>
    <li> Received the paul sebastian balm on july 13 2012 didnt get to use it till aug 10 when opened it was just lotion no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called Tuccini co talked to very rude lady that said it was past 30 days ( which it wasnt ) said that i either put it in the sun light or cold and changed the makeup of the balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this same balm 4 times I know what  the right one is like. This representive for the company must have thought i was stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not satisfied with the company the reps that answer the phones or the products.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s new favorite aftershave lotion!  He prefers lotions to liquids as they&#x27;re so much easier to apply. No dripping.</li>
    <li> my husbands favorite after shave</li>
    <li> Fast service and good product as always.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this on my husband and the softness it adds to his face.He always ask me to order more he is hooked on it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and have always enjoyed using it.  Feels good and smells great without the overwhelming aroma many after shaves have.  I use it along with the PS moisturizer and cologne.  Great products.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product in the past for my husband from Amazon and its far cheaper than the the department stores prices.  I just bought two more bottles to give as gifts, that is how much I love this after shave. Amazon as always was the best place to buy it from they were fast and no problems with the order.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the feel of my complexion.  Compared to other I purchad this was the best for the price</li>
    <li> If it&#x27;s PS it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND HAS USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS. I WAS SADDENED WHEN MACYS NO LONGER CARRIED THIS. HOWEVER I FOUND A SITE THAT I CAN ORDER IT FROM.  I SURE HOPE IT WILL ALWAYS BE AROUND.</li>
    <li> This is a stronger aroma than other balms I have purchased in the past.  It smells good and I&#x27;ve received compliments</li>
    <li> This is my hubby&#x27;s favorite fragrance - he especially likes the way they&#x27;ve balanced the sandalwood.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> PS balm is an excellent product. Soothing going on with a pleasant aroma. Arrived on time and in excellent condition. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> excellent!  very happy</li>
    <li> I use the balm in the winter when I don&#x27;t enjoy splashing my face with a cold liquid.  The balm is not as effective in soothing the skin as the after shave liquid.  Product was delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the balm. He hadn&#x27;t tried this PS product before.</li>
    <li> At  very pleasant aroma that is good for sesitive skin. I have used it for several&lt;br /&gt;years and it has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> Scent didn&#x27; match what i bought in the store.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my husband and he loves it too.  Came in so quickly  and always makes it so easy to order.  Thank you.....</li>
    <li> Has been my favorite for many years. Don&#x27;t use any other after shave balm. Use to pay at least 3 times more than I pay now.</li>
    <li> I have always preferred balm to aftershave for its soothing feel on the skin.  The PS has that soothing feel.  Like other reviewers have noted, the musk scent is fairly pronounced, but if you wet your hands before you pump the balm into them, that extra bit of water dilutes the balm enough to soften the scent and to make application more even.  When you consider that the Amazon price is just slightly more than 1/3 of what the department store price is, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> IT WAS WHAT I EXPECTED.  COULD NOT FIND IT IN DEPARTMENT STORES AND WHEN I USED TO PURCHASE IT THERE IT WAS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE</li>
    <li> A nice size at a very fair price.  Love the fragrance on my man!  Don&#x27;t be afraid of this one!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Receive Many Good Comments. I like the balm because it conditions the face and doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol sting when applying. I don&#x27;t often rate products as high as this one leaving some room for improvement but this is a perfect 5 star. I trust this product as well as Amazon. Keep up the good work. Boomer</li>
    <li> My father loves this scent, and so reminds me of him  It made a great &#x27;good day&#x27; gift.</li>
    <li> Results: 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels better after this than any aftershave I have used recently. I think it is on about on par with the caswell Massey 1752 almond, which beats the pants off anything else I have tried. Seriously, smoother, softer skin - and no irritation at all on the neck. This is becoming a go to before court or important meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;For $10-$12 for four ounces, it&#x27;s unbeatable. Twice the product for the same money as anything I&#x27;ve used that is comparable in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell..... 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;If you like woodsy, manly smells - you will like this. This might be how Hemingway smelled if he used mouthwash and lived in a pine forest. It reminds me of my grandfather. The smell is clean, green-ish, a touch smoky, and somewhat strong. I don&#x27;t mind it one bit, but I like the smells of scotch and soap and cedar (and cordite and motor oil, etc). My girlfriend does not like it and it seems to last a bit longer than others, so I&#x27;m docking a star for potentially offending your mate... Though if I had to choose between a mate and a scratched up neck, I can&#x27;t get another neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have irritation issues, this is a great balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used today with: EJ-de89 razor, feather blade, the blades grim &amp;#34;smolder&amp;#34; shave soap (I&#x27;m surprised at how good that turned out to be, buy that too), proraso pre shave cream, and a small block of barbers alum.</li>
    <li> So much better than after shave</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff so do other women.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most manly fragrances I have ever come across.  Got this for Christmas two years ago, and didn&#x27;t realize he was running low.  Ordered on line from this seller and will certainly do so in the future!!!</li>
