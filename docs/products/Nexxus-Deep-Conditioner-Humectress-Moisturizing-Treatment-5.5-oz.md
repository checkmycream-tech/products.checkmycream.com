<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it. It is so very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> To echo the sentiments of many here who use this conditioner on chemically processed hair, Nexxus Humectess works for me every time.  I have relaxed AA hair that dries out easily, and the Humectess helps me maintain that delicate balance of moisture and softness without feeling heavy or greasy.  I also like to mix the Humectress with my bi-weekly protein treatments to counteract any potential protein overload.</li>
    <li> Leaves the hair feeling great and soft and moisturized.I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews.. But this thing is seriously hair crack! My hair is addictive and I swear it has withdrawals if I don&#x27;t use it. It makes your hair baby soft and keeps it nicely moisturized throughout the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this along with nexxus split end repair thing (sorry, I don&#x27;t remember the name, but it was the one for binding split ends... anyway it left my hair really dry), the humectress leaves my hair feeling sooooo nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, damaged, weak hair (sad, I know) but I&#x27;m sure this will help my hair repair especially with keeping it moist during the cold (the cold dries out my hair and makes it break a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, BUY IT!!! I&#x27;m only writing a review because I&#x27;m about to order another one and try the leave-in too! :)</li>
    <li> My hair was done-fried, damaged, overprocessed and breaking off like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I bought this conditioner and left it covered with a shower cap for 45 minutes-voila! My hair is soft, silky, and on its way back to health (as long as I don&#x27;t decide to highlight yet AGAIN.LOL).&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner has been around for years because it works. If you had a major hair oops like I did, be sure to get Humectress. You will be happy you did!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading all the glowing reviews, thinking, \\&quot;Wow, maybe I truly have found the answer for my hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE your money!! I have bleached my hair, just the front and had funky colors in it, till recently, I have decided to go back to a natural hair color. Well, I have been waiting to make an appointment with my hair dresser. (My schedule is insane at the moment) So I just needed a quick fix to make my hair look not so dry in the front. Now while my hair is dry, it&#x27;s not wirey dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product simply did not work, period. I tried it several ways. 10 minutes with a shower cap on, no difference. 2 hours with a shower cap on, still no difference, OVERNIGHT with a shower cap, feels a little better, but I think I may have not rinsed it out all the way. For the price I have paid for this product, it should work the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe this was due to my hair being so dry that maybe it may have needed a couple of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, this may not work, since my hair is severely dry. But even on the back section of my hair, that has not been bleached, did not make that part feel any different either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Moroccan Oil Treatment from the salon, in the past, and I have had WONDERFUL results with that. (Do NOT pick up the cheap imitations at the store, I have and they are a complete and utter waste of money!)</li>
    <li> love this deep conditioner, I will never be without it!,&lt;br /&gt;It the very best ive tried ....and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!  Buy it, you&#x27;ll never regret it!</li>
    <li> I have tried tons of products for my hair.  This is the BEST stuff around for my color-treated, fine hair.  Keeps my hair soft and shiny!!  I used to purchase at my local Target - but - they stopped selling it!!  I am SO glad I found it here!!  I would be at a loss without it!!</li>
    <li> I was experiencing breakage due to a protein over treatment so i decided to try something new and got the nexxus hydrating treatment deep conditioner at walmart....it stopped my breakage with just after one use. would definitely recommend this product for anyone battling with dry hair due to lack of moisture.</li>
    <li> Almost $15 for a tiny jar of butter that doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair. Last time I&#x27;m purchasing this. I get similar if not better results with Garnier Fructis. This is a total rip-off.</li>
    <li> If you have dry hair you will love this deep conditioning treatment! It REALLY DOES work great. I shampoo my hair first &amp; towel dry it &amp; comb the product through my hair &amp; then put a disposable plastic beauty cap like this one: [[ASIN:B0001M3K5E Elastic Plastic Processing Caps - Unit Of 100 Caps]] on &amp; then I kick back &amp; relax for 30-40 min. before washing it out (it states to leave it on for 10 min. but longer is better). I do this at least once a week &amp; my hair is like silk afterwards! Fantastic deep conditioning treatment.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair that tends to be dry and frizzy. I use it once a week. The first time I used it, I got immediate results. My hair is softer and shinier. I had several people comment on the shine and texture, after only two uses. Even though the container seems small, 5.5 oz, I predict I will have at least 6 treatments out of it (my hair goes to mid-back). A palmful went a long way. So well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**March 2014: I had to update my review and lower the star rating because this product contains Dimethicone, which I have stopped using in any of my products because of it&#x27;s long term effects on hair and skin (drying). Dimethicone is a liquid silicone that coats your hair and prevents moisture from getting it. The beauty industry uses it because it makes your hair look shiny and silky, since you are coating your hair with a shiny substance that doesn&#x27;t absorb. It acts as a plastic barrier on your hair -- great for frizz and shine, but bad for letting moisture in.</li>
    <li> I got mine from local drugstore. Since everyone here rated it so high i checked to make sure that contents inside looked the same as the other containers to make sure i didn&#x27;t get some odd thing but i did not. It left my hair just as wiry but duller and as tho i put lotion into it (which i have in the past because it&#x27;s so thick, course and unruly). Actually about a year ago i had a bright idea of using deep conditioner for Afros and it was as tho i put car wax on my hair, this Nexxus product is reminiscent of that. Not nearly as heavy but a bit like it. It&#x27;s not as frizzy as regular conditioners and the next day it looks ok so it&#x27;s not so bad. I&#x27;m not impressed tho.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that I am black with relaxed, dry, resistant, coarse hair. I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners but this conditioner by far surpasses it&#x27;s duties.  My hair was manageable and conditioned fully...the smell was inviting too!  I wish this came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Terrific. Just rinse well.</li>
    <li> This is my first Amazon review-I buy so much here, and the reviews help me so much, that I thought I should reciprocate. So-I bought the Nexxus conditioner because my hair was fried from highlighting. I have been using it for three days now and my hair definitely feels better. It has been a little oily but I&#x27;ve been using a lot of it. Once my hair starts to feel better then I will probably use less and fewer times per week. I&#x27;m very happy with it overall and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> 3 stars due to price to quantity/volume ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is kinda &amp;#34;Meh&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly works great as a substitute conditioner, but for anyone with hair to their shoulders or longer, they will use up the product really fast. Using it post shower in damp hair as a leave in conditioner can easily cause hair to be too stiff. But at the same time, you don&#x27;t want to wash it all out. So it is a very tough balancing act. And if you let your hair air dry, it can be a very lengthy process. I tend to use this product more as a skin lotion/cream after I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have hair down to my butt, I fear if I use this product to its&#x27; best potential, I would eat through it in just a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is genuinely a 5 star quality product, but not when I factor in price and quantity. I hope they consider a bulk option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the container is short and fat and commands a lot of latteral space. A taller more narrower bottle/jar would be better suited for a bathroom product. This thing is as wide as the 33.8 oz (1 litre) bottles, and only 3 inches tall.</li>
    <li> Left my hair oily and didn&#x27;t repair anything.  I do not recommend this.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked wonders on my fine dry curly (frizzy) hair!  I will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s so my hair is not as smooth and shiny as it was 30 years ago.  This product gave me a lot of the &amp;#34;luster&amp;#34; back.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I just used this last night for the first time after a protein treatment with Avocado,egg, mayo, and coconut oil. For the record, i have relaxed hair which tends to be very dry. After I washed out the protein treatment, i applied the Nexxus to my hair, starting with my ends working my way up, and sat for 30 minutes under a hooded dryer. After my roller set, i wrapped my hair. in the morning, my hair was amazing! It was soft and looked great. I would have to use it without the protein treatment to see if it was really worth it but so far, it was worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> High quality conditioner!  I&#x27;ve tried many and this is top rated!</li>
    <li> It made my hair oily after wash, and made me feel like I need to wash it again. I am not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, has never let me down!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing (kind of like Aussie, which also has coconut oil in it) and works really really well. Its also one of those conditioners that even if you leave it too long, it doesnt make your hair feel unhydrated after. As in, when I leave deep conditioners like Pantene in my hair too long, my hair somehow ends up dryer than before I conditioned it. In a word, Pantene sucks. But this product can be left in for a really long time and gives you amazing results.</li>
    <li> This is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve found!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B008YTZ3OC Nexxus Ultimate Moisture Gift Kit]]The best. I Big Chop my hair 7 months ago after wearing locs for 8 years. Let me tell you I was a product junkie until I met Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisture deep conditioning treatment. This is and I will say again this is my staple product and I also use a Nexxus Leave in. Just with these two products my hair does not need as much oil as it use to.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth every penny. I also bought a kit that had Nexxus conditioner and shampoo in it at the same price with this conditioning treatment. Have not use those yet but once I do I will do a review on those too.&lt;br /&gt;I will just say this change my hair or should I say it made it what it was suppose to be....I am so happy....</li>
    <li> Amazing treatment. I used this after I used Nexxus Emergencee Restorative Strength Conditioning Treatment and it really gave my hair the moisturizing it needed. I have very dry course hair and as soon as I used this it made my hair feel moisturized and when I straightened it, it&#x27;s silky smooth. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this deep conditioner based on the glowing reviews off Amazon, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I loved the results of this product so much that it inspired me to write my very first review after years of ordering from Amazon, and I&#x27;ve already placed an order for a second batch. I&#x27;m African American and my hair is DRY. I constantly have to load my hair with creams and oils to keep it from drying out, especially before I blow dry it after a wash/condition. However, after using Nexxus Humectress, my hair is soft and silky smooth, with nothing else needed. My only complaint is that I wish it was available in greater amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated on 8/13/12: The packaging on this product is completely different from the way it was packaged when I first started purchasing it. I&#x27;ve been buying the offer for two at once for better pricing, found here: [[ASIN:B004FOCWBC Nexxus Humectress Moisturizing Treatment Deep Conditioner, 5.5 oz, 2 Pack]] And as you can see they&#x27;re both labeled the same, but they look different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually saw this Nexxus conditioning treatment pictured here in a drug store and bought it thinking I&#x27;d save money while still getting the same product. However, it doesn&#x27;t work as well. Also it&#x27;s not as thick in consistency as the original. My suggestion is to go to the link I&#x27;ve posted, and purchase from there since it seems that Nexxus has changed the ingredients on this particular buy.</li>
    <li> I am part Caribbean Indian and European and my hair is thick and soft but I didn&#x27;t have the time to take care of it properly and it used to come out when i combed it. I used this product for the first time last week two days before using wen shampoo and my hair felt stronger and very little hair came out when I combed it. It really does work very well.</li>
    <li> Read that this was good but for me it is just ok. I have long curly hair &amp; I don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair. Thought it would be a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> The deep conditioner I received today is not the same stuff I&#x27;ve been getting through previous amazon orders and in salons. The packaging and ingredients are different...I am planning on returning.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this product even though I read great results. After years of relaxing my hair it became thin and lifeless. I must say after the first use of this product in conjunction with Nexxus Humectress ultimate moisture conditioner, my hair looks remarkably different. Co-workers and friends noticed instantly. My hair is bouncy, full and soft. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It truly does a wonderful job of conditioning your hair.  I use it about once a week and it keeps my hair nourished, shiny, and manageable.</li>
    <li> My hair appears thicker and healther.  I will be repurchasing, in fact, I am purchasing more from the product line.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair very easy to handle while wet and keeps is smooth and soft when dry.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight,  layered hair.  This hair masque is not heavy.  Since I have fine hair I know better than to apply a large amount of any conditioning product.  I used a small amount on the lower portion of my hair, not scalp, and the results were great.  It left my hair soft and healthy feeling.  I have always prided myself on the fact that I had extremely healthy hair. (per my hair stylist of 20 years)  I never had split ends, but, I never used any heat applicators, ie, dryer, curling wand, etc.  Now that I have layered hair and apply heat to my hair a couple of times a week, I was looking for a non-greasy, not heavy, hair masque to use once a week.  I am pleased with this product, but only use it once a week.  Given my fine, straight, hair.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This worked well. It made my relaxed hair manageable and soft. I wish the size was much bigger. It finished quickly.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I tried Nexxus Deep Conditioner. It leaves my difficult hair soft but manageable.  I have fine gray hair that is difficult to style.  Ive been a fan of Nexxus products for a long time so I wasn&#x27;t surprised that I liked this conditioner.  I like too use it on a day when I&#x27;m going to be home most of the day.  I shampoo and towel dry my hair before putting about a tablespoon of it in my hair.  I like to leave it for several hours even though it&#x27;s probably not necessary.  After a warm water rinse out I blow dry and style my hair.  It&#x27;s wonderful to have found this great product.</li>
    <li> This product really works well.  The only problem I have with it, is that it really makes my head itch.  I have a very sensitive scalp and this just sets it off.  It really cuts down the frizz and split end look.  I wish I could use it!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful deep conditioner !!! my only warning is to those who have hair types that don&#x27;t do well with protein masks and such.  My hair isn&#x27;t and I use this DC, weekly.</li>
    <li> Does the hair good!  Lots of moisture and very manageable.  Great results for my natural hair!</li>
    <li> Amazing product I really love the smell and texture, mixing it once in two weeks with babyface pure protein keratin treatment just makes your hair feel like silk and look so amazingly healthy!!</li>
    <li> nothing fancy about this conditioner or the nexus line for me, except that it is over priced&lt;br /&gt;recently tried out biolage and it is a much better conditioner balm</li>
    <li> This stuff is something I do on Saturday mornings with my daughters as  mommy-me treat. A little goes a long way, and my hair is smooth afterwards and feels nice. I think I&#x27;d suggest this in lieu of more expensive products in that it does basically the same thing.</li>
    <li> My hair has become dry due to coloring and this conditioner has been a great help in keeping my hair looking healthy.  I would recommend this to anyone with dry or frizzy hair.  But if you are looking for a conditioner that won&#x27;t weigh your hair down, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> This reveals immediate results.  I use it once a week.  Seller service was excellent and I plan to re-order as needed.</li>
    <li> best deep conditioner I have ever used, leaves your hair soft and silky. I will never used anything else but Nexxus</li>
    <li> I love the smell but even when you use very little of the product, my hair just felt oily for days. It was ok but wont buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of deep conditioners in the past year, and I have to say that this jar is definitely at the top of the list! I tried the Nexxus Humectress regular conditioner last month and I wasn&#x27;t a big fan, but I happened to catch this jar during a sale and thought, &amp;#34;Oh, why not?&amp;#34; I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deep conditioning treatment left my relaxed hair soft and smooth, and boy, is it creamy! I&#x27;ve used this conditioner twice on its own, and the results were wonderful. I can&#x27;t wait to try it in my pre-shampoo conditioner mix.</li>
    <li> I now understand why it is in the top products for damaged hair. Great value for price as well! :)</li>
    <li> I use this for when my coarse, wavy hair is being a jerk. A little goes a long way, and you definitely need to give it a few minutes to soak in for it to really work. It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re going to home-dye your hair and want the color to soak in better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have super coarse hair, especially if it&#x27;s curly, this won&#x27;t get you the softness you need and you&#x27;ll need something stronger. This barely cuts it for me and my hair is medium coarseness. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, if that matters to you. This will beat any grocery store/drug store hair conditioner, but salon grade is much better at moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner almost every time I wash my hair and I love the way it makes my somewhat processed hair feel + look. I get compliments every time it is freshly done (ok, from my husband, but that counts in my universe).</li>
    <li> This conditioner really sucked for me, and I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews.  It made my hair dry, rough, and horribly tangled, not very conditioned at all.  I also lost a lot more hair in the shower after I used it a few times.  I read the ingredients and found that it&#x27;s full of proteins, which are supposed to strengthen hair.  That definitely wasn&#x27;t the case for me.  It wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all, I think the name is really misleading.  I thought that maybe since I bought it on amazon it&#x27;s not the original product? Bottom line, I will not buy again, I&#x27;ll probably throw the rest out.</li>
    <li> I have used better ones- supermarket of shelf type. In my case waist of money-does not do the job :(</li>
    <li> I both color and perm my hair and nothing helped moisturize my hair. This product keeps my hair shiny and healthy looking. I tried other products before finding this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for over a year and it is the best my hair has ever been. It is healthy and so silky and soft. I am African American and I have processed hair and I have no problems with breakage anymore. It is a bit pricy but I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I leave the conditioner in for 10 minutes. My hair is not only silky, smooth and manageable, but it is also stronger.  I like this product so much. that I won&#x27;t use anything else.  Recently, the store where I had been purchasing it stopped stocking the  conditioner.  I immediately checked Amazon, and was so thankful I was able to purchase it online.  Thank you Amazon.  I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m black with 4a/b relaxed, thick, bra strap length hair. I wanted to shop around for a deep conditioner and this came recommended. I tried, used the whole jar, and for the money it doesn&#x27;t do everything I want. It&#x27;s very thick and easy to apply but it wasn&#x27;t very detangling overall and there&#x27;s little to no slip. This was especially annoying when I&#x27;m trying to get through new growth-this neither softened nor made my new growth easier to manage. That&#x27;s very important to me so at ~$3/oz for 5oz, this isn&#x27;t worth that high price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, it works well for my natural hair the only thing is it is a little expensive for my current budget so i&#x27;ll have to find ways to stretch it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this (along with a protein conditioner) because of reviews I&#x27;ve read...and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. Nexxus always makes a good product. I did find it a little cheaper at one of the hair stores...and I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat dry, very curly, frizzy hair. I switched from B&amp;B Deeep Conditioner, which I really liked, to to Nexxus Humectress product and find that it actually does a better job at moisturizing (and I need a lot less of it), not to mention it&#x27;s a lot less expensive. I use it once a week for deep conditioning and plan to continue doing so because I really do find it works for me.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST deep conditioner that I have ever used. I have to use 2-3 thick applications in the shower, and even after that, I can still hear my hair ripping when I try to brush it. Neutrogena&#x27;s deep conditioner that comes in a jar works a million times better and is probably 1/3 of the price. I will never buy Nexxus hair products ever again. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just like the title of my review, this product just worked wonders for my hair! After using it, my hair was so easy to comb, silky smooth, no tangles.  It also smells so good!  This is from now on my fave conditioner!</li>
    <li> Its the best product ever, my hair feels stronger and longer since I started to use this product I recommended</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I put in in my hair and then sat under the steamer.  My hair was softer and felt divine.  Smells good too</li>
    <li> I really like this it keeps your hair mositurize and soft.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really say it gave me much improvement, but it smelled good and felt like it was a good consistency for good quality.</li>
    <li> I love all nexxus products. I don&#x27;t use this conditioner as recommended to sit on the hair (I&#x27;m too impatient). I leave it in for about 3 minutes while still in the shower, then rinse &amp; follow up with normal conditioner. I always get out of the shower with my hair feeling soft and fluffy; I can tell it&#x27;s helping to heal the damage of all the dying, hair-drying, and flat ironing I do. I repeat once a week, and by the end of the week I can tell my hair is ready for a new application again.</li>
    <li> This is not the real Humectress by Nexxus, just the presentation is similar. I used to buy this product in the sal&amp;oacute;n and i know very well how it smells and the results you notice in your hair is inmediatly. What i received was bad packaged and the cream was spilling out of tha pot, and i had the bad idea of to give it a chance and try it,my hair was horrible, i couldn&#x27;t even dentangle. This product is not the original!! Threw it to the trash can. Very dissapointed and afraid to buy anything thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> My hair feels dirty after I use it. I experimented with different amount but my hair never looked good. It would be good for really coarse and dry hair.</li>
    <li> Its doing what it said it would do.</li>
    <li> omg best product ever!! I first use this repair conditioner at my sisters, it left my hair soft and silky!!! I have very dry freezy hair and this works wonders on my hair!! I purchased it right away!! No regrets what so ever!! Price is great!</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair and relaxers tend to dry your hair out. I&#x27;ve tried other conditioners and deep conditioners w/o any results. After using Nexxus Humectress deep conditioner, I was in love! My hair was so soft and shiny (no exaggeration). The price might seem a little high to some people, but believe me, it&#x27;s worth it! The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because I&#x27;ve only used it once. But can you imagine w/ subsequent uses?! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for my daughters hair, she has been doing swimming classes once a week for 2 years and it has definitely taken a toll on her hair. I have her leave it on for 10- 15 minutes and her hair comes out really soft and more her normal brown hair color, since the chlorine was turning her a bit blonde.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed after reading good reviews. I&#x27;d try Moroccon deep conditioning next. This did NOTHING. I have chemically &amp; color treated hair that feel rough and dry. So I bought this. I kept it on for 20 mins with a shower cap, then washed with warm water. My hair felt a lot light, as if they would fly away, I lost the luxurious weight of my hair and felt no added softness. Did not feel like deep conditioning at all. What&#x27;s rather great is the Nexxus anti frizz shampoo that comes with moroccon and coconut oil in it. Now, that&#x27;s a fabulous product, almost felt like I had deep conditioned my hair with that shampoo. Seriously!!</li>
    <li> I love it! Its really help my hair to look moisture and shine.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed, 4a hair that tends to be a bit on the dry side. Nexxus products were my staple before I really learned how to properly take care of my hair, and for the most part, I still like them. This product is decent - not great, not terrible, just decent. It left my hair pretty moisturized and soft, but it didn&#x27;t perform as well as other, cheaper deep conditioners I have used. Moreover, I didn&#x27;t really notice a significant difference between this deep conditioner and the Nexxus humectress moisturizing conditioner. The ingredients are very similar so I&#x27;m guessing the only difference is in the formulation and thickness of the conditioners. If you have to choose between the two, choose the regular moisturizing conditioner. You get more of it and it works just as well (if not better).</li>
    <li> With really curly hair this is a life savior.  Use it also as a leave in.</li>
    <li> I used this on my overbleached hair after I rinsed out Nexxus Emergencee. I put it all over my hair, let it air dry a little bit, then alternated between blow drying and air drying for awhile before rinsing it out. The Emergencee adds the protein and gives hair life back but it really needs a good moisturizer like this afterwards. I&#x27;m not totally sure that this is worth the price but it is very good.</li>
    <li> I had my hair bleached and it got fried really bad. I read reviews for this conditioner and I decided to buy it. I put it on for 30 minutes, put a plastic cap on and sit under the dryer and my hair comes out like silk every time and it stays like silk for quite a few days before I do it again. I deep condition twice a week and it has made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I over process my hair, with highlights, blow dryer, curling iron. Nexxus is awesome, it brings back the moisture leaving my hair soft and beautiful again. It has a pleasant scent too! I tell everyone about this deep conditioner. I got my 22 year old son using Nexxus products. The girls love his hair!</li>
    <li> This product has left my hair feeling so soft. I love it and i can see a difference in my hair. just hopes the price goes down so i can buy another  jar.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best deep conditioners I have. It truly helped repair my hair and it get back into shape. I colored my hair so much and this product made it stronger.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars because although its a good product, it&#x27;s not comparable to a deep conditioning at a salon. With that said, this is my 3rd purchase of this product and I will continue using it between in salon treatments.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing conditioner a little pricey but it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I loved loved loved this! First try and my hairs amazing already</li>
    <li> Ever since getting my hair permed, my hair and scalp has been extremely dry. This Nexxus Humectress Conditioner has greatly improved the texture of my hair and even given moisture to my scalp. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be too heavy for my fine hair, but it is fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or greasy. Now when I comb my hair I don&#x27;t loose a load of hair on my comb. Instead the comb glides right through my hair day after day. I treat my hair for 30 minutes after every wash 2 to 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> It worked pretty well for my 4b African american hair. but I brought it a while ago so I&#x27;m not sure if the formula has changed at all.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Nexxus product . ..  . . . .I have been using this for years and still lives up to its name. I have very dry color treated hair, and I use this once a week. I leave it in about 15 minutes and then I rinse it out and does wonders to my very dry hair. Leaves it shiny, smelling wonderful and full of body!</li>
    <li> The ingredients are amazing, and something I&#x27;d assume my hair would love. But there was no slip, and it left my hair feeling worse than it did before. Now it&#x27;s just a tub of never used conditioner laying around with all my other never used products,</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my sister suggested it, so I bought it to give it a try, and it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I am using this in combination with the moisture therappee shampoo, humectress conditioner, and emergencee treatment. I received a very bad perm that fried my thin, fine hair and required cutting off more then 12 inches. What I had left was super dry and brittle and completely unmanageable. Within 10 days these products have changed everything. I condition my hair ever day, and shampoo ever 2nd day. I follow shampoos with this deep conditioner, leaving it on for 10-20 minutes, and use the regular humectress conditioner on alternating day. The result is that I can comb my hair without a shower of broken ends falling down. My hair is soft and much more manageable. It is of course still very damaged as no product can completely repair hair, but I no longer cry when I look in the mirror.</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt better.</li>
    <li> IM African-American with 4a/4b relaxed hair. I put this in my hair mixed with JBCO and EVCO and this stuff is on the money. My hair came out shiny and moisturized for days. My new growth loved this stuff. I only wish it would come in bulk or a bigger size but its worth your money. I took about three scoops out using a spoon to cover my entire head</li>
    <li> this products takes a couple of uses but eventually it leaves your hair shiner and it feels flowy and healthier too</li>
    <li> This is a really good, effective conditioner at a very good price. It&#x27;s as effective as the higher priced conditioners in salons. It has really made a difference in my hair. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Because I have dry, brittle, blonde hair that I blow dry and flat iron every day, I use this conditioner daily.  I have noticed a TREMENDOUS difference in the texture, shine, and softness of my hair!  It also helps tame my frizzy ends and makes my hair feel heavier, if that makes any sense.  I would recommend this product to anyone with dry hair!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t help frizzy hair it made it greasy and that is not a good look. Hair looked like I didn&#x27;t wash it for a week. disappointed</li>
    <li> I should say first that I am a Nexxus junkie. About 3 years ago my hairdresser (whom I used to see infrequently) washed my hair with Nexxus once and I fell in love with the smell, so I decided to buy some shampoo and conditioner. You can read my other reviews on the other products I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in conjuction with so many other Nexxus products and I&#x27;ll give you a run down of everything I do below. I will warn all you readers, though about each product. Be prepared; this is a long review, but informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Therappe Shampoo - It smells great and I really have no complaints. I havent used any other Nexxus Shampoo, so I dont have much to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment - This is awesome! I have tried other Nexxus conditioners (Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisturizing Conditioner, Nexxus Keraphix Restorative Strengthening Conditioner, and Nexxus Hyrda Sleek Silken Smoothing Conditioner) But none compare to the moisturizing power this stuff has.&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Pro Mend Overnight Treatment Cr&amp;egrave;me - At first this seemed like the answer to my split-end prayers. It truly, truly does repair split ends. However, it took my curly/wavy hair (think Halle Berry in Their Eyes Were Watching God movie) to BONE STRAIGHT hair. Seriously, you cannot find half a curl in my hair. Obviously, it changes the structure of your hair when it binds the split ends, so be warned if you have curly hair this may very well change your hair&#x27;s structure. Since it worked so well for me, I continue to use it only on my ends while I allow my curls to grow back. For my African American readers: It looks like a perm is growing out of my head; curly/wavy at the roots and straight on the ends. I press my roots and flat iron my hair for work anyway so I dont look too funny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the reason why you are here: Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor - Having used Nexxus Emergencee reconstructor I am familiar with Protein Treatments and the effects on my hair. Let me be frank, this blows other Reconstructors clear out of the water. I&#x27;ve used (stinky) Aphogee Keratin Reconstructor and it doesnt even compare. I learned the hard way that too much protein (as this product is super strength and can easily deliver) will cause your hair to break. After just 2 applications of this product on my entire head - it caused my edges to break off! That is how strong this is. Like I said previously, I had been using Emergencee for 2 years and had never had any breakage, but just 2 applications of this stuff and my hair was looking very rough around my edges. I should mention also, that during my first 2 applications of this product I left it on for 30 minutes at a time, once a week. The directions recommend just 10 minutes every 2 weeks. I stopped applying it to my edges and they recovered in just 2 weeks or so. All in all, as long as you dont overdo it you will see great results. If you&#x27;re not asleep yet, keep reading to learn about the steps I take every week to acheive really healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash my hair with Nexxus Therappe Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;2. Allow my hair to air dry until it is only slightly damp and apply Nexxus Pro Mend Overnight Treatment Cr&amp;egrave;me and leave it in overnight.&lt;br /&gt;3. Wash out the Promend and apply Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor on my entire head (except my edges). Cover with a shower cap and leave on for 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Wash out the reconstructor and apply Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment to slightly damp hair. Cover with a shower cap for about an hour (while I clean my bathroom or do laundry or something domestic)&lt;br /&gt;5. Rinse out the conditioner and allow my hair to air dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;6. Heat Style my hair: Press the roots and edges and use an electric flat iron to straighen my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The results:&lt;br /&gt;After a day and a half (EVERY WEEKEND!!!) of repeating this process, my hair is probably the shiniestand bounciest hair you will ever see. It is so soft and healthy, you could run your fingers through it and not hit a snag at all. As a black woman it feels great when non-black people compliment me on my hair. Not any of those well-meaning, yet, condesceding remarks such as, \\&quot;Your hair is so cool\\&quot; or \\&quot;Wow, I wish my hair could be like that\\&quot; I get, \\&quot;Wow, your hair is so pretty\\&quot; and \\&quot;How do you get your hair so soft?\\&quot; Seriously, I have shared my procedure with all my friends and family.

    <li> I love this. It makes my hair look and feel so good. I have been using this for about 3 months. I love it. I would recommend this for over treated hair</li>
    <li> I love the silky smooth feel of my hair now, thanks to this conditioner.  This Nexxux Conditioner for hair growth with Biotin is a wonder for those with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Great treatment for Dry hair. This product will put life back into stale dry hair and give it life. I use about 3 times a week to keep my hair looking great!</li>
    <li> This is like the original Humectress from the salons.  It lasts a long time even though it&#x27;s a smaller container.</li>
    <li> My favorite deep/conditioner! I use it regularly on my dry ends.</li>
    <li> I love Nexxus humectress conditioner. I have compared the deep conditioner&#x27;s ingredients to the Nexxus humectress conditioner. I honestly didn&#x27;t see a lot if difference. That being said, this deep conditioner is awesome. My hair was soft, manageable and it smelled great. I hardly recognized my hair. Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t take more than five minutes with this deep conditioner. So if you are pressed for time, you can still get a good deep conditioner. For me, I leave it on longer than five minutes and I sit under a hooded dryer. The results are even better then. I have afro textured relaxed hair. The only less than positive is that the jar is small; but you don&#x27;t need much product. This product has no parabens.</li>
    <li> I used this with the promend line. My Hair was buttery smooth after the first use. I combed it out in the shower and the comb ran through it seemlessly. The next morning my hair felt like silk. I have FINALLY found my go to deep conditioner! Nexxus is my favorite line of hair products. My hair is nearly bra strap length. My goal is for it to be BSL by summer. Between this, promend and emergencee it&#x27;ll get there!</li>
    <li> This deep conditioner does nothing at all for my hair, It leaves my hair feeling just wet. I can&#x27;t tell the difference after I shampoo and I after deep conditioner. I will go back to biolage, I thought this was a little cheaper so I bought it. I will come out of my pocket to get better results.</li>
    <li> I have natural African-American hair and I use this conditioner almost every week. It really helps to keep my curly hair manageable.</li>
    <li> Nope. Loaded with silicone. Nothing is worse for your hair, it coats it with an impermeable layer and no moisture can get in. Yes, initially it seems great, or at least OK, but over time it will ruin your hair. I used Kerastase by the bucket full for years and my hair just would not get soft anymore. I couldn&#x27;t even get a wide tooth comb through it in the shower, loaded with conditioner.  I finally learned to use a clarifying shampoo and after several washes with that, and NO more silicone ridden products, my hair felt like hair again - soft, styleable and able to accept conditioning with actual conditioning effects. I have since eliminated all silicone products and my hair, which is thick, long and beautiful when cared for properly, is in great shape again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything ending in -cone, is a silicate, and it is the fourth ingredient in this product.  Don&#x27;t put it on your hair!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this all the time, but when I do use it it is because I need a product that will revitalize my dry sun bleached hair.&lt;br /&gt;Under normal circumstances, I use this weekly or more often during extremes in weather such as brutal winter weather or hot summers when I spend a lot of time outdoors, in chlorinated pools, and salt water. The manufacturer&#x27;s instructions tell you to distribute this treatment in damp towl dried hair, leave it on for 10 minutes, and rinse thoroughly in lukewarm water. I leave this in my hair for at least 30 to 45 minutes and cover it with one of those cheapo plastic shower caps you get at hotels. You know, cheap and easily disposable stuff. I rinse as directed. The results are incredible. My hair is silky clean without any residue. It&#x27;s not greasy or weighed down, but it looks shiny and nice and doesn&#x27;t belie the constant abuse that my hair is exposed to.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this deep conditioner. It is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.</li>
    <li> my hair has a lot of damage from bleaching it but this works wonders. I love how soft and silky my hair looks after I use it. I use it 2ce a week.</li>
    <li> I just bought this and let me just say &amp;#34; OMG&amp;#34; this really is by far the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used and I use Paul Mitchell, phyto, Wen hair products I leave this in my hair for like 15-20 min and BAM my hair is fuller and this conditioner will not weigh your hair down I have long highlighted hair so my hair needs this and it definitely makes my hair fuller w body! Highly recommend this product for all you females out there.Especially if you get your hair colored or highlighted every 2 to 3 months :)</li>
    <li> I live up in a ski resort at 7300 feet. DRY DRY DRY.Like other users of this product, I leave it in for a while longer than the label says and there really is a terrific difference in my hair. I also alternate this with Nexxus Emergence and with Amazon&#x27;s great prices, I will continue to use it. My hair was thin and broke easily when I brushed it, but now it&#x27;s thicker and looks and feels luxurious.</li>
    <li> This is not good. It doesn&#x27;t work like a conditioner, in fact it made my hair more tangled, coarse, and hard to brush. SO disappointing.... :( usually I love everything Nexxus - what&#x27;s up with this stuff? Wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - it leaves hair super soft, less brittle (ends don&#x27;t look as dry) and great shine to it.</li>
    <li> I really like Nexxus products. I am using the shampoo therappe ultimate moisture and the promend split end binding conditioner and I really love them! Especially the conditioner! It leaves a very nice not cheap smell and of course leaves your hair shiny and almost virgin ! But this mask ... Ugh! It is made of some cheap consistency ... Meaning it&#x27;s not greasy enough I guess, because it should nourish your hair. Also I didn&#x27;t receive the one that is on the picture of the amazon site but another packaging with a black lid which makes me thing that this is not authentic at all! Maybe I am just overreacting but overall I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair. I use this stuff mixed with my other stuff every other day. It keeps my fine hair from tangling and I have found I don&#x27;t have to brush my hair as often and it stays looking full and thick. Great product!!! :)</li>
    <li> heard that this product worked very well from cosmeotologist, ordered and received many compliments.  have referred others to this product</li>
    <li> My daughter and I were doing some shopping at our local grocery store, one of our fave things to do is look for the \\&quot;Close Out Pricing\\&quot; signs, It usually means its expiring or being discontinued. As we were walking down the beauty aisle, out of the corner of my eye I see a $2.49 shelf tag in the higher end price section. All the Bed head, Paul Mitchell, Nexxus, etc... It was the Nexxus Deep Conditioner, usually for close to $20 I figured Why Not?! The 1st time I used it I fell in love. My hair for the 1st time in years had NO frizzies, it laid so beautifully and the comb went through my wet hair like silk. I went back a couple days later thinking i&#x27;ll buy every jar on the shelf but it must&#x27;ve been a mistake because the same jars were now marked for $13.59. Guess what, I still bought it!! I use to buy Wen as a treat for myself, never ever again. This is perfection in a jar and still cheaper. My hair is thick and heavy and now I am proud of it. I get compliments on it daily. Give it a try, if its not for you send it my way, lol!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use less expensive products that work better!  However it smells really good! Perhaps it works best on Caucasian hair...I&#x27;m aa with thick natural hair!</li>
    <li> The purchase came on time and was just what we had expected it would be thanx. I would order it again</li>
    <li> I enjoy the fragrance and it did end up making my hair soft. Even though I liked it, I probably would not purchase it again because Suave Keratin works just as well, if not a little bit better for a lot less money.</li>
