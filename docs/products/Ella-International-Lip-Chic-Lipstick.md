      <li>and it&#x27;s the best product.  </li>

      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>Lip Chic is a wonderful product!  </li>
      <li>This is great!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This one works best for me.</li>
      <li>Amazon seems to have the best price.  </li>
      <li>Instead of three layers, I tried one and it was perfect then.</li>
      <li>It works wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>AMAZING is the best way to describe it.</li>
      <li>now it works great</li>
      <li>I was happy with the results.</li>
      <li>This lip sealer works great until you eat.</li>
      <li>I have experienced tingling lip products before-</li>
      <li>It is as good as any product of its kind I have used with an excellent value.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it&#x27;s amazing for matte shades!</li>
      <li>nothing removes it but warm water and a washcloth!  </li>
      <li>The price offered was good and delivered in timely order.</li>
      <li>Very good instructions which is the important part to evaluating how good the product works.  </li>
      <li>I just love this product!</li>
      <li>:) I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t give an honest review since I haven&#x27;t used the product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like to think of myself as a hippy, but the chemicals in this kind of scare me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;ve found the product really isn&#x27;t effective with glossier colors.</li>
      <li>You kind of have to experiment with what works with whatever lipsticks and glosses you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Using a lip liner pencil combined with a lip primer works best for me - not this stuff that&#x27;s mostly alcohol and very drying.</li>
      <li>Love love it!</li>
      <li>This is the best sealer I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
      <li>if you need to reapply, its easy!</li>
      <li>Works very well and lips are GORGEOUS!</li>
      <li>Buy it and look great much longer!</li>
      <li>It works and I love it.</li>
      <li>I will try it again during the summer in more humid conditions.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite Lipstick Sealers.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, this is</li>
      <li>I also love the burn and smudge proof science.</li>
      <li>Lasts forever :)</li>
      <li>Works perfectly when used properly.</li>
      <li>I would say that my lipsticks lasts maybe 2 more hours then it would without this on.</li>
      <li>It works OK.  </li>
      <li>I used it over a creamy formula, but still, I think it should have held up better than it did.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for many years.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better on your skin than in it.</li>
      <li>I love it....</li>
      <li>Lastly, as a theater teacher, I think this product would be especially good for situations like a stage performance, wedding, etc...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lipchic for close to 20 years and love it the way I use it.</li>
      <li>Even though this product had better reviews than some of the others, it was sticky and peeled.</li>
      <li>this is such a great product!</li>
      <li>i would bring it with me if i were going to something where pictures are being taken just to make sure.  </li>
      <li>Is this even safe to use?  </li>
      <li>Nonetheless, until I find something better, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
      <li>I am looking forward to using it on the big day, and I know my lipstick will now look flawless!</li>
      <li>It made my lips all crusty,  I even made sure to stretch my lips</li>
      <li>I came across this Lip Chic and thought that if it is safe on lips and works to seal lipstick color, why not on brow color, too.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff and have been using it for years -- this, coming from someone who cannot seem to get lipstick to stay on for longer than five minutes.  </li>
      <li>Received this for Christmas to use with my red lipstick and I love it!!!</li>
      <li>it really makes your lipstick last i&amp;#34;m very impressed with this purchase will be ordering more</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I use this with super-liquidy Lip Tar (kind of like how you&#x27;re not supposed to use this on lip gloss), but it doesn&#x27;t really work well on it.</li>
      <li>I am happy to know that I can now order on line and not have to go to my local store.  </li>
      <li>The BEST WAY to use this product is to apply it to your lips and then keep a wide smile or grin on your face for a minute or two while the liquid &#x27;sets up&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Amazing that we ladies can eat, drink, talk, etc., and this sealer keeps our lipstick \\&quot;sealed.\\&quot; I highly recommend it to all.</li>
      <li>DO clean the brush every time before returning it to the bottle</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it for my wedding and special occasions though.  </li>
      <li>I still like certain of those, too, but I have so much more range now.</li>
      <li>But it comes right off if you use your lips for anything but speaking!  </li>
      <li>I used it with bright red lipstick and had no problems.</li>
      <li>I used it with bright red lipstick and there was no transfer.  </li>
      <li>very good seal lip color, the initial tingling is tolerable for the benefit offered, it is best to apply a thin layer of lipstick and then the sealant and ready does not run and does not stay in cups or silverware or persons</li>
      <li>I HAVE USED FOR 15 YRS, AND IT REALLY WORKS TO KEEP MY LIPSTICK FRESH FOR MANY HOURS EVEN AFTER EATING</li>
      <li>any discomfort goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>I use great quality lipsticks that stay on pretty long</li>
      <li>again, my lipstick wore off fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>Regarding durability, you may have to reapply after drinking very hot liquids.    </li>
      <li>new bottle does seem to have more staying power, so perhaps the formula was improved.  </li>
      <li>Love this product - can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
      <li>this has worked pretty well!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work fantastic with more conventional lipstick, though!</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous product and it really seals the lipstick for the day!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Certainly worth using.  </li>
      <li>This product makes lipstick stay in place for hours...can&#x27;t honestly say it would stay on through a meal unless you had several coats in place.  </li>
      <li>Only thing is it stings a bit and really can&#x27;t be that good for you.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be worth the cost if it worked.  </li>
      <li>I really love this product and recommend it to anyone, especially women like myself who have special needs because of our aging skin.</li>
      <li>My first time using Lip Chic was a success.  </li>
      <li>I am 58 years old and have certain favorite brands and shades that I wear.  </li>
      <li>It does have an initial tingle and you need to make sure you extend your lips (almost a batman&#x27;s joker type smile) between coats (allowing 15-20 seconds before coats).  </li>
      <li>Delivered very fast.</li>
      <li>This product really works!  </li>
      <li>Fill in your favorite lip color and it will last all day.</li>
      <li>Lasted pretty well all day through meals and kissing.</li>
      <li>This stuff does exactly what it says it does</li>
      <li>What can I say, I just tried this out for the first time today and IT WORKS.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This really didn&#x27;t seem to do anything but make my lips dry. It didn&#x27;t seal any color on it. I&#x27;ll have to try it with different lipsticks, but for the 3 times I&#x27;ve tried using it, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> My lipstick stayed on longer.</li>
    <li> This product really works!  If you are willing to take the time to follow all the steps and not rush them this product really does seal in your lipstick.  I used it with bright red lipstick and there was no transfer.  It doesn&#x27;t quite last all day but much longer than lipstick alone.</li>
    <li> I just always wanted to say that about a product.  My first time using Lip Chic was a success.  My MAC magenta-colored Rebel lipstick stayed on all night (6 hour-evening) until I washed it off with soap and water.  I still had a bit of a pink stain the following morning.  Breakfast and a second scrubbing got rid of that.    I bought the product because I was browsing an online makeup supplies store&#x27;s FAQ and someone asked, \\&quot;Does Lip Chic really work?\\&quot;  I had never heard of it before, but the store&#x27;s in-depth affirmation made me curious. I wish I had this for my wedding-- I think it would have made one less thing to worry about that day.      About the tingle - it&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t handle, and the package instructions say with continued use you won&#x27;t notice it.  It warns you not to use it on cracked lips, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the safety of the ingredients (currently it does not have a rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep site: [...] .  Like anything made for the makeup industry it&#x27;s better on your skin than in it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Been using it for about 5 years now.</li>
    <li> Does not work as expected</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I bought this for my wedding to preserve my red lipstick and keep my new husband&#x27;s face clean. Not only did this product make my lipstick totally kiss proof, it lasted through appetizers, dinner, dessert and champagne. Though it began to fade near the very end of the night, it didn&#x27;t flake at all, which is my complaint of many long-wear products. What I really like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t dry into some thick layer of icing on your lips. Instead it makes your lipstick dry in such a way that you don&#x27;t feel like you have anything on your lips at all. This stuff does exactly what it says it does and well. My only issue is that for some reason it just doesn&#x27;t jive with one or two of my lipsticks--instead of drying it can get sticky. But it does work for a majority of my lipsticks, so I really can&#x27;t complain much. Lastly, as a theater teacher, I think this product would be especially good for situations like a stage performance, wedding, etc...I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this on an everyday basis. I did learn that if you blot your lips before applying it, it will stay on longer. Delivered very fast.</li>
    <li> it kept my lipstick on all day. Even eating a meal, only a minor touch up was needed. It kept lipstick off my fake front teeth and my water bottle. The only thing it didn&#x27;t do was prevent feathering. It definitely had some noxious fumes and a mild to moderate burning sensation upon application,  though that faded soon. The downside to the product was that it made my lips feel intolerably dry. By the end of the day I felt miserable from how dry they were. It is the dead of winter. I will try it again during the summer in more humid conditions.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Lipstick Sealers. It burns the lip upon initial application however less so than other sealers I have tried.  I find that my lipstick will stay for about one hour and then I need to reapply.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery as always, so can&#x27;t complain about that.  I was excited to try this product, but when I did it ended up drying my lips horribly and taking a whole layer of skin with it!!! Guess it&#x27;s not for me :(</li>
    <li> I have been using LIPCHIC Lipstick Sealer for quite a number of years. After trying other products on the market on occasion, I am 100% convinced no other product comes close to this one. Amazing that we ladies can eat, drink, talk, etc., and this sealer keeps our lipstick \\&quot;sealed.\\&quot; I highly recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> I did not find this item to work for me.  I saw it on TV and purchased it the same day.  My lipstick still comes off.</li>
    <li> it really makes your lipstick last i&amp;#34;m very impressed with this purchase will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Just horrible! As though my skin is peeling off my lips!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom and this is her rating: She said it doesn&#x27;t last and makes her lipstick crack. Worst sealant she&#x27;s ever used and would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I use this with super-liquidy Lip Tar (kind of like how you&#x27;re not supposed to use this on lip gloss), but it doesn&#x27;t really work well on it. I&#x27;m sure it would work fantastic with more conventional lipstick, though!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time, and feel it is worth the price and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> If I could give it minus stars, I would. Even if you follow the directions carefully and completely. This is terrible. It balls up your lipstick. Dries your lips. It smells like straight alcohol.</li>
    <li> Sorry I bought it!  Very drying, didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Like putting a clear coat of nail polish on my lips. Set for 2-3 hours then peels away the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> It hurts my lip and stinks!!!! I need to remove it immediately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, purchasing it from another vendor that discontinued it, so I knew it was somewhat irritating.  I&#x27;ve learned to ignore the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new bottle does seem to have more staying power, so perhaps the formula was improved.  Overall, I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> It stings like heck.  There are other, better, products made now that I buy instead with total satisfaction.  Using a lip liner pencil combined with a lip primer works best for me - not this stuff that&#x27;s mostly alcohol and very drying.</li>
    <li> Lip Chic is a wonderful product!  I have used it for years.  My life is quite busy and I don&#x27;t like to redo my make-up after putting it on in the morning.  Lipstick was the only big problem...it wore off.  I also did not like to see lip prints on glasses, cups, silverware, or anywhere except lips!  I discovered it years ago when my daughter was getting married...I gave a bottle to each of her bridesmaids to use on the Wedding Day...they did, I did, and I have been using it almost daily since then!  There are no harmful additives that would be injested after years of use. There are no \\&quot;lip prints\\&quot; on anything but LIPS!</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when Benefit discontinued their She Laq sealant.  I search all over the internet and did not want to risk trying to buy on ebay.  I came across this Lip Chic and thought that if it is safe on lips and works to seal lipstick color, why not on brow color, too.  I was happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I saw it on The Today Show.  Unfortunately, my lipstick did not last any longer than normal with this product.  In fact, my lipstick flaked off after about 10 minutes. I do not recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> This kept my lipstick on for a while but then made my lips peel.</li>
    <li> I was looking for She lac by Benefit, but since it&#x27;s been discontinued I thought I&#x27;d try another product.  This one SUCKED!!  You put it on and it does the tingle thing... and shortly after that you find that your lipstick has mostly melted off.  What hasn&#x27;t melted off will come off with a couple of touches to the lips.  Furthermore, if you have sensitive lips, DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT, I&#x27;m currently suffering with multiple burn bumps as a reaction to this product.  My lips are sensitive to heat and sun exposure normally, so I&#x27;m thinking whatever it is in the product that makes it &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; also caused a reaction on my lips.  Not sure if this happens to everyone, or just people with sensitive lips. Anyway, I do NOT recommend this product even in the slightest.  If I could give a lower score I would.  Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> This really does lock in my lip color and doesn&#x27;t make it transfer at all if I cover my entire mouth in 1 or 2 coats. The only problem I have with it, is if I want really long-lasting lip color, I have to put on at least 3 coats. By then, it starts to make your lips feel really dry and fake, though. If you want to put a lipgloss over it to combat that, it has to be a very thin, clear gloss. Otherwise, the lip chic and your lip color will start peeling off in little chunks. You kind of have to experiment with what works with whatever lipsticks and glosses you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I do really like this product and I can&#x27;t wait to see how kiss-proof it is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lip Chick Lipstick Sealer for over 10 years now and it is the best on the market! I&#x27;m in my mid-50&#x27;s now and have wrinkle lines above my lips and this sealer stops any lipstick &#x27;bleeding&#x27; into the wrinkles. It also preserves the lipstick to last all day! The BEST WAY to use this product is to apply it to your lips and then keep a wide smile or grin on your face for a minute or two while the liquid &#x27;sets up&#x27;. Once it&#x27;s set, I can keep my lipstick on all day without any bleeding whatsoever. I really love this product and recommend it to anyone, especially women like myself who have special needs because of our aging skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for years -- this, coming from someone who cannot seem to get lipstick to stay on for longer than five minutes.  Only one complaint: the gold paint rubs off the handle of the bottle.  Why don&#x27;t you just leave it unpainted?  I get tired of pulling something so ratty looking out of my purse to use on my lips.  Otherwise...terrific.</li>
    <li> very good seal lip color, the initial tingling is tolerable for the benefit offered, it is best to apply a thin layer of lipstick and then the sealant and ready does not run and does not stay in cups or silverware or persons face</li>
    <li> It is as good as any product of its kind I have used with an excellent value.  Very good instructions which is the important part to evaluating how good the product works.  We have to use it as directed for all the benefits. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Works perfectly when used properly. Negative comments clearly from newbies. Apply two layers, keep lips apart for a minute or two, and voila. I also love the burn and smudge proof science. No more stains on my girlfriend&#x27;s vagina!</li>
    <li> It stings for a little while after you put it on. It seemed to work but I obviously missed a spot as I got a stain from my lipstick while putting on my favorite slip. Try two coats.</li>
    <li> Reading the directions included with this little beauty is a MUST, but after than smooth sailing and happy long lasting lips :3</li>
    <li> This lip sealer works great until you eat. Then it cracks and breaks off in little pieces.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  This feels icky on your lips and rolls off in unsightly little clumps.  Skip this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 15 years....I love it....it works when applied correctly!!!  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> What can I say, I just tried this out for the first time today and IT WORKS. It definitely does the job. Also, my lips only felt dry for maybe the first ten minutes and then they felt normal the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing that sucks about this stuff is that it does BURN in the first few seconds of application. It feels alot like if you were to get alcohol into a split on your lip, except it feels that way all over. However, it wasn&#x27;t unbearable or anything and it passed within a few seconds. That was the only unpleasant part (other than having to smile constantly for the first minute to let it set) and otherwise it&#x27;s been no muss, no fuss, does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to! I wear very dark purple lipsticks and this stuff is keeping them from coming off on beer bottles or on kissed cheeks. :) I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
    <li> Love this product - can&#x27;t live without it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a lipstick sealer - your lipstick will last far longer if you use this on top of it.  It stings a bit when you first put it on.  Try to resist using a lot, it just takes a thin coat.  If you use too much it feels funky!  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> This products works but doesn&#x27;t keep my lipstick on for much longer than without it. It&#x27;s drying, which I expected. I would say that my lipsticks lasts maybe 2 more hours then it would without this on.</li>
    <li> This product is difficult to find in my area. The product works well and I like my lipstick to last all day if possible. This performs well-I usually touch up in late afternoon if I need too! The price offered was good and delivered in timely order.</li>
    <li> So far this has done a nice job of allowing my lipstick to last longer and it has stopped feathering.</li>
    <li> This is the best sealer I&#x27;ve found so far.  It seals my lipstick all day with matte shades - no lipstick on my coffee mug or constant reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve found the product really isn&#x27;t effective with glossier colors. I&#x27;m guessing the sealer can&#x27;t dry properly.  Hence, 4 stars and not 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s amazing for matte shades!</li>
    <li> Even though this product had better reviews than some of the others, it was sticky and peeled. I used as directed and it was just awful.</li>
    <li> best and least messy blow job experience ever.</li>
    <li> This product did not work as expected or advertised.  My lipstick seemed to wear off pretty much like it always does.  I used it over a creamy formula, but still, I think it should have held up better than it did.  I would not waste my money on this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before.  I am happy to know that I can now order on line and not have to go to my local store.  The store had discontinued carrying it and so I was so relieved to know I could still purchase Lip Chic Lipstick Sealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product--does what it is meant to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dana&lt;br /&gt;Louisville, KY.</li>
    <li> If you follow the instructions, it works.  I used it with bright red lipstick and had no problems. Only thing is it stings a bit and really can&#x27;t be that good for you.  I don&#x27;t like to think of myself as a hippy, but the chemicals in this kind of scare me.  I&#x27;m using it for my wedding and special occasions though.  Maybe it will actually help me build up a tolerance for poison in case my new husband gets any ideas, like locaine powder in The Princess Bride.</li>
    <li> Works very well and lips are GORGEOUS!</li>
    <li> This stuff sucked. It gave me a slight uncomfortable burning sensation every time I applied it to my lips and that would be OK if it actually worked and made my color last longer but it doesn&#x27;t work on iota. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I had never heard of it until the friend who did my makeup for my wedding used it on me. Having never worn lipstick before, Lip Chic made it stay on all 5-6 hours of the wedding with no noticeable loss of color. I was shocked, and so was everyone else. I bought some for myself in a decision to start wearing lipstick since I could now prevent it from rubbing off. It makes my lips a little dry, but I can still lick them or put lip gloss on top without ruining the look. It took me a little while to place the smell of it, but when it&#x27;s wet, it smells like liquid wart remover. The smell goes away quickly (since it dries quickly), but it&#x27;s a little disconcerting at first.</li>
    <li> It is somewhat helpful for a relatively short period.  I had used this a long time ago.  It cakes up a bit on your lips after a few hours.</li>
    <li> been using this for a few years now it works great</li>
    <li> I just love this product! I am 58 years old and have certain favorite brands and shades that I wear.  With my busy work schedule i don&#x27;t have time to stop and re-apply all day long. I put this stuff over my lipstick in the a.m. and color stays until i eat something oily. I don&#x27;t feel any stickiness or anything when it&#x27;s on.  Buy it and look great much longer!</li>
    <li> This works just like it should.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;&#x27;m a 70+ woman who has always been fussy about the appearance of her lipstick.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things and Lip Chic is absolutely the very best product I have found to deal with those nasty little creases that form around the lips and into which the lipstick finds its way, producing a messy appearance.  I gently line the outside of the lips with a waterproof kohl skin-colored crayon. Then I use a lip pencil to line the outer edge of the lips.  I fill in the center using a lip brush.  The last step is applying the Lip Chic to the edge where the lip liner is--just to set the liner in place.  Neither the smell nor the &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; bothers me--both pretty insignificant.</li>
    <li> It burns my lips, so don&#x27;t like to use it anymore and didn&#x27;t even do what it suppose to.</li>
    <li> You brush this product over lipstick.  It keeps lipstick from bleeding into wrinkles.  Makes lipstick stay on lips longer.  I&#x27;ve tried different brands.  This one works best for me.</li>
    <li> Love it! Used it before and it doesn&#x27;t rub off the lipstick on my lips! Lasts forever :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll likely order more in the future :)</li>
    <li> Works so far.  This mattes out your lipstick and really does extend there wear</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipchic for years.  It works wonderfully.  I put my lipstick on in the morning and it lasts all day at work, even through eating and drinking.</li>
    <li> Does not work AT ALL. Followed directions exactly</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED FOR 15 YRS, AND IT REALLY WORKS TO KEEP MY LIPSTICK FRESH FOR MANY HOURS EVEN AFTER EATING</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting married in October and will be wearing red lipstick, which during trial sessions with the lipstick...proved to be quite difficult. Red is just the worst for staying in place and lasting longer than an hour. When I ordered this, I was doubtful, but it works. I am looking forward to using it on the big day, and I know my lipstick will now look flawless!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product and it really seals the lipstick for the day!&lt;br /&gt;I use Lip Chic every time I&#x27;m going out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipchic for close to 20 years and love it the way I use it. Prime lips, apply a coat of Lipchic on outline of lips, line lips with a lip pencil, then another coat of Lipchic. Fill in your favorite lip color and it will last all day. Try it- you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> If I could choose ZERO stars I would have.  This product had no effect whatsoever on sealing my lipstick.  I tried it on several different varieties and colors, followed the directions for drying time, etc.  and Nothing.</li>
    <li> Yuck!  It made my lips all crusty,  I even made sure to stretch my lips so the stuff would dry in the groves of my lips.  It didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Received this for Christmas to use with my red lipstick and I love it!!! Apply one coat let dry 1 minute then apply 2nd coat and your lipstick is going nowhere! Eating, drinking, talking...nothing removes it but warm water and a washcloth!  Does tingle a little at first, nothing painful though!  If on the fence just buy it, you will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> This product makes lipstick stay in place for hours...can&#x27;t honestly say it would stay on through a meal unless you had several coats in place.  Certainly worth using.  Amazon seems to have the best price.  Saw it on other sites for almost twice as much.</li>
    <li> tho&#x27;t this would solve my problem with keeping lipstick on but it doesn&#x27;t. again, my lipstick wore off fairly quickly. i keep trying it but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. also, makes your lips very dry.</li>
    <li> i wanted something to make my lipstick last more then a few mins! this has worked pretty well!  i would bring it with me if i were going to something where pictures are being taken just to make sure.  if you need to reapply, its easy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using lip chic for years!  I actually use it on my lip pencil and not over my lipstick.  I use great quality lipsticks that stay on pretty long but when they do wear off my lip liner which I put all over my lip is always there.  I don&#x27;t mind reapplying the lipstick.  Whatever your use...I love this product and have been using it for almost ten years.  My system works for me.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, this is my 2nd order andit helps my liptick stay on longer! I keep re-ordering it! Love love it!</li>
    <li> I have not found anything equal to a discontinued product from Estee Lauder for lipstick bleeding.  I&#x27;m 54 and all lipsticks bleed on me.  This said to apply a thin line around the lips, which I did, and it did ok but not great.  I get a smudged look effect.  Nonetheless, until I find something better, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the product from the mixed reviews, but tried it and it&#x27;s the best product.  I use to only wear lip gloss because I hated that my lipstick would constantly have to be reapplied and the color would bleed.  This stopped that and I now wear it daily.  The trick is to use a base moisturizer, then apply your lipstick, blot then apply 2 to 3 coats of the lip chic and it will last all day with no need to reapply.  I eat and drink with the product on.  I will caution that if you are eating heavily oiled foods such as pasta with olive oil it will remove the seal and you will need to reapply.  Otherwise, no problem.  It does have an initial tingle and you need to make sure you extend your lips (almost a batman&#x27;s joker type smile) between coats (allowing 15-20 seconds before coats).  I have recommended this product to friends, family, make-up artists and stylists since I started using it.  AMAZING is the best way to describe it.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money.  I thought it would be worth the cost if it worked.  It did nothing at all.  I was never so disappointed with a purchase in my life. It sounds petty since it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $22.00 but I don&#x27;t like to waste money no matter what the amount is and I certainly wasted it on this product.</li>
    <li> this is such a great product! it&#x27;s non-aggressive and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips too much, yet it really WORKS!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical from reading some of the reviews of this product since some found it to be &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;. After using it once without reading the directions, it was definitely was. After reading the directions, I realized why. This product should be applied after lipstick has been blotted. Applying without blotting will leave lips sticky. I tried it again, and applied two coats to well blotted lips. AMAZING. My lipstick didn&#x27;t come off on anything for the entire day. I had no need to reapply and no lip-marks on any glasses (or faces!). I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone with the same love-hate relationship I&#x27;ve always had with lipstick. It lets you have the color without the worry that it&#x27;ll get everywhere and wear off.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  Lasts a long time and works.</li>
    <li> didnt work. i returned it.</li>
    <li> This really works well.  I haven&#x27;t had any problem with stinging or dry lips, however, I do apply Vaseline on my lips at bedtime.  Note:  DO clean the brush every time before returning it to the bottle so you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;contaminate&amp;#34; the sealer with color residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lip sealers for years.  Trying this for the first time and found it to do what is says.</li>
    <li> Burns. Smells horrible. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Keeps lipstick firmly in place, no bleeding. Leaves wine glass crystal clear.</li>
    <li> Before going to out into bone chilling weather, I apply this over product my chap stick or lipstick.  It really helps alleviate/avoid chapped lips.  Regarding durability, you may have to reapply after drinking very hot liquids.    I also apply it over chap stick before going to bed.    P.S.  My dentist says, \\&quot;To avoid chapping, NEVER lick your lips in cold weather!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I followed the directions exactly and did not receive any improvement in keeping lipstick on.  The bottle is very small and with the required number of coats did not last more than a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will definitely use at my wedding. I have experienced tingling lip products before- any discomfort goes away quickly. My first two attempts with this were frustrating because it would crack apart when I smiled and peel off, but I was putting too much on! Instead of three layers, I tried one and it was perfect then. Lasted pretty well all day through meals and kissing. I will probably touch up once a day in the future just because.&lt;br /&gt;Thorough and helpful instructions in box. It advises to moisturize the night before use and I think this would help with any drying effect people have issues with. This will be a staple in my makeup kit!</li>
    <li> My wife hated it and it went in the garbage. She said it had a horrible chemical taste and felt weird on her lips.</li>
    <li> this is a horrible product!  I makes my lips a flaky, chunky, dried-up mess. I&#x27;ve been using 18hr lipsticks that work well, but the color choices are limited. So I thought I&#x27;d try several different Lipstick Sealers so I could use them with any colors.  What a bust!  Each one I&#x27;ve tried have produced similar results. Yuck!!!  I&#x27;ll stick with long-wearing lipsticks like Revlon Colorstay &amp; Loreal Infallable.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t give an honest review since I haven&#x27;t used the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been more interested in determining whether Red Roses Lip Rouge by Beeswork&lt;br /&gt;would work - didn&#x27;t want to complicate the trial by adding another product to it.</li>
    <li> it worked when was first applied, however does not last as long as expected. wanted it to last longer.</li>
    <li> As others have already said, this product is not the miracle it purports to be.  It does keep your lipstick on pretty well if you don&#x27;t drink or eat.  But it comes right off if you use your lips for anything but speaking!  The directions suggest applying several coats, but I found that it is drying and cracks if I do this.  So use it if you are not going to ingest anything, but don&#x27;t expect it to protect against marks on your water glass.  This product is quite a bit better than other sealers I&#x27;ve tried, but the only real solution for long-lasting lip color seems to be cosmetic surgery.</li>
    <li> I got this so I could kiss my boyfriend without leaving marks on him. It worked like it was supposed to. Takes a little longer than the directions say for it to dry completely. You should definitely figure out a way to keep your lips stretched while this is drying, because if you just hold your lips still in a neutral expression, it&#x27;ll crack a little when you smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this is that it came off while I was eating a food with lots of olive oil. I might not wear this (or lipstick for that matter) if I&#x27;m going to dinner...</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product.  It is very much like just putting clear nail polish on your lips.  Is this even safe to use?  Had to return it because I couldn&#x27;t bear to use it.</li>
    <li> Overall this product does the job. It burns a little bit, and the smell is very strong however if you can tolerate that it should work well.</li>
    <li> It takes time to learn how to apply this.  It requires a lot of experimentation.  It works OK.  Could be better especially after the TV review I saw on the Today Show.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years.  It works and I love it.</li>
    <li> This is great! No more having to buy expensive liquid 24 hour lipcolor. I still like certain of those, too, but I have so much more range now. Thank you, thank you!</li>
    <li> Oh boy, I made a mistake buying this item.  It is SO drying that I could only try it once.  It arrived quickly--no complaint there.</li>
</ol>
