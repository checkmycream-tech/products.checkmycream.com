<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I wear for running.</li>
    <li> My favorite engineer would bring this wonderful Kinesys sunscreen with Parasol 1789 home as a gift from a Canadian co-worker, as Parasol 1789 had not yet been approved for the US. Some years ago, the sunscreen  was  available in the US, but only from dermatologists. Avobenzone is Parasol 1789.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather be outdoors than indoors, except for making many of my favorite meals for all my favorite men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, four of the 1 oz.gift  bottles have survived my meticulous household management. Therefore, the cumbersome 4 oz. bottle was quickly \\&quot;div-ied up\\&quot; into the smaller bottles. The smaller 1 oz. bottles are a better delivery system: especially for us Southern ladies. Sweet tea, anyone?</li>
    <li> Every other sunscreen on the planet makes me break out in hives. This sunscreen is great.  It&#x27;s easy to apply.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like coconuts.  And, I&#x27;ve never gotten a  sunburn while wearing this.  I mostly use it for hiking, biking, and running.</li>
    <li> A little goes A long way-Only prob is bottle is hard to hold while applying .fingers slip off spray top when oily.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  No smell - it is a little greasy.  You need to wait a couple of minutes before you get dressed.  Otherwise, it goes on easy.</li>
    <li> This worked okay. I liked it because it is easy to apply. Most of my vacation was cloudy or stormy so I did not really have a good opportunity to test it, but I did not burn.</li>
    <li> Pluses: Easy to apply. Smooth. Invisible. Non-greasy    Minuses: I burned and developed a load of freckles!    My complexion is fair thus sunscreen that works is very important for me. I picked this up at Whole Foods before leaving for Hawaii in April after reading all the positive reviews here at Amazon. I used the product a great deal during those two weeks. I felt as though I had no protection on since I could keenly feel the burning on my skin as if I&#x27;d gone outside unprotected. I truly wanted to be a champion for a product so light and easy to apply but the results weren&#x27;t good for me. My husband was amazed &amp; surprised at how much freckles had surfaced on my skin. My face had barely a freckle on it when I left and when I returned my whole face was freckles like I&#x27;ve never seen in my life! I&#x27;ve always been careful in the sun. Even in Hawaii I would wear a hat and some sort of wrap or light sweater on my shoulders &amp; arms. Of course, when I was in the ocean my skin was exposed but otherwise I was careful even though I was wearing sunscreen.  My recommendation for the especially fair-complected is to bring a back up sunscreen of another brand in case this does not work for you so you are not stuck. I was re-applying this like you wouldn&#x27;t believe when I felt the burning and saw the redness but to no avail. While at the farmer&#x27;s market I felt the burning heat of the sun right through my light sweater and yes I had this sunscreen on underneath. I ended up bumming sunscreen off from others as the journey progressed. While the concept is nice, this product did not deliver. I&#x27;ll be looking for a lotion sunscreen in the future.</li>
    <li> i was excited to use this product then when i got to my vacation and tryed it the bottle wouldnt spray!!very upset and had to use a toxic sunscreen!!</li>
    <li> Used this sunscreen on Spring Break in Belize and Mexico. Believe me, we were very pale and vulnerable to burn, but even after hours in the sun, there was no burn whatsoever. I love this sunscreen because it is so sweat-resistant, and doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes at all. The fragrance is very, very minimal (a big plus for me) and finally, it is so easy to apply--not at all goopy. It is expensive per bottle, but pretty economical to use because of how little is needed per application.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about halfway through the summer, and it worked very well.  I am super pale and I burn if I look at the sun the wrong way, so it did it&#x27;s job.  I only had a few complaints about it, though...first off was the price.  It wouldn&#x27;t bother me so much, but the bottle didn&#x27;t last me too long.  It barely lasted me 1 1/2 months, and I used it maybe once or twice a week.  Also, the bottle doesn&#x27;t like to be sprayed upside-down, so getting my legs and back was a little annoying.  But it does not feel like sunblock at all, which was the reason why I purchased it in the first place.  It is a little greasy when it first goes on, but that feeling doesn&#x27;t last too long.  I will probably get some next summer if the price doesn&#x27;t go up too much.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect sunscreen to use for the entire family.  I use it everyday on my three-year old, and it sprays on very evenly.  It&#x27;s not sticky, nor does it smell like sunscreen.  We haven&#x27;t burned once this summer, using it for hours at a time.  I do recommend re-spraying if you go in the water for an extended amount of time.  Very easy to throw in our bag or keep in the car.  I love it!!  Plus, the environmental working group reported that it&#x27;s low in toxic chemicals.  That&#x27;s why I initially bought it.</li>
    <li> One of the few sunscreens regarded as near completely safe at the cosmetics DB, and in no way sticky.    The only downside is the price.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is highly rated by the EWG (Environmental working group) as being one of the safer sunscreens on the market. Plus, it&#x27;s an easy pump spray and it isn&#x27;t greasy or oily like other brands I&#x27;ve tried. It absorbs easily, and is a good sunscreen overall. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Bottles small enough to fit in the car door, diaper bag or purse.  This product really works with no offensive smell.</li>
    <li> I loved this sunscreen. I researched sunscreens and the ingredients in sunscreens for a couple months as I have a photo - allergic reaction to all of the mainstream sunscreens sold in drugstores. After wearing this for 6 days on the beach in NC with sunny 95 degree days, I did not get burned at all and even better I did not get an allergic reaction. One annoying thing was that the spray function did not always work.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen may work well, but I can&#x27;t verify that, as the sprayer stopped working half way through my application for a trip to the beach. Also, the whole container got very slippery. I ended up pouring it onto my hands to finish applying it where I could reach. For the amount this costs, there should be no problems. I would not recommend this sunscreen at all.</li>
    <li> Makes it easy to spray on your self, back especially.  No stinky smell and love the idea that this is better for you than some other sprays on the market</li>
    <li> KINeSYS sunscreen has been a favorite of mine for 7 years.  I&#x27;m a runner, and have found it very easy to apply and very effective as a sunscreen.  It also stays on, doesn&#x27;t smell, and protects even after prolonged sweating.  The fact that it&#x27;s very easy to apply also makes it very useful now that I have children.  KINeSYS makes a children&#x27;s formula, but even the regular formula works great for my kids and is easy to apply quickly and thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Clear liquid, no fragrance. No oily residue to damage climbing ropes, fiberglass etc. I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it.</li>
    <li> Beware that this is not an odorless product.  It has the standard sunscreen smell but less strong smelling than banana boat or other department store products.  The spray feature is nice and it is not greasy.  Outrageously expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> This was suggested to me by my dermatologist and it is the best sunscreen I have ever used. A quick spray and it&#x27;s done. Non greasy and so easy to apply..I prefer the unscented  If you need to choose a sunscreen your search has ended..</li>
    <li> 2 hours on the beach and in the water and we got a little bit of a sunburn.  Not as waterproof as I would&#x27;ve liked.  I have very fair skin and I was only a little pink which tells me it did work. Just not as good as I thought it would for the price. Pay attention to your skin and reapply often. It goes on greasy but absorbs nicely and no scent.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product! Easy to apply, it dries very fast and you don&#x27;t fell the skin oily or smelling like sunscreen. I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
    <li> I was recommended this sunscreen by a friend who had chemical peels done to her face.  It is important to use sunscreen without alcohol.  This is great!  You can wear it over your make-up or before you apply it.  Spray it into your hands and then apply it to your face.  It dries fairly quickly and I don&#x27;t notice a scent.  This is perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t like a lotion.    As far as the cost is concerned, this is more expensive than something you get at the drugstore, but loads cheaper than sunscreens sold at department stores or at dermatologist&#x27;s offices.  So I find it to be a happy medium.</li>
    <li> Our family has been using the Kinesys spray for years.&lt;br /&gt;1)  Super easy to use pump spray (comes out like a mist and sprays sideways too to get around the body)&lt;br /&gt;2)  No fragrance, no odor&lt;br /&gt;3)  Does not sting or run in the eyes (love!!!)&lt;br /&gt;4)  Sprays on like clear oil but dries in minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!  I&#x27;m happy to pay more for the benefits of all the above PLUS paraben-free.  Keep making these Kinesys!!!</li>
    <li> Very expensive and contains Avobenzone, so it is not organic or safe. I am returning it and buying an organic sunblock.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have ran 42 marathons and this is the only sunscreen that I have found that I don&#x27;t have to re-apply during a run.  It also doesn&#x27;t mix with my sweat and burn my eyes.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and used the ENTIRE bottle for 3 hour beach day.  Resulted in my child being extremely sunburned.</li>
    <li> As many have said this goes on like water. Other spray sunscreens leave my skin feeling tight like I just got out of saltwater. This stuff also has no smell, if you really get down and sniff it there is a mild pleasant odor, but from a foot away no smell at all. IT WORKS, I don&#x27;t tan at all and went shirtless all day on a rafting trip with no burn. I will be buying more of this product again, too bad local stores don&#x27;t carry it</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no other sunscreen like this one.  It&#x27;s perfect for the whole family.  Best yet, it&#x27;s safe and effective, as it doesn&#x27;t contain the dangerous ingredients in most common sunscreens.  It&#x27;s light, goes on smooth, dries quickly.  It wears great, even under makeup!</li>
    <li> I have one kid.  This kid does not like sunscreen.  Doesn&#x27;t like the feel of it, doesn&#x27;t like the smell, etc. etc.  Of course, since we live in coastal California, I make my kid wear it, even when it&#x27;s overcast.  But it was always with the rolling of the eyes, and the exasperated \\&quot;Mom, uch...\\&quot;  KINeSYS changed all that.  Now she actually puts it on without me even having to ask.  Great for big people, too!  Goes on like a light moisturizer, but protects like a heavy-duty sunscreen.  Add to that the fact that it is alcohol-free, fragrance-free, PABA-free and they don&#x27;t test it on animals; count my family in as a lifelong fan!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product that feels like you&#x27;re not wearing sunscreen. I&#x27;ve been a long time supporter of this sunscreen. I have yet to find anything comparable.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every sunscreen out there and Kinesys is by far the best.  The spray makes it quick and easy to apply, it isn&#x27;t greasy (a must for my husband and kids) and is unscented so you don&#x27;t stink.  It absorbs quickly and is good on your face.  I use it every day, year round and it&#x27;s much easier to apply on squirmy kids than the stinky, greasy lotions most people use.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I got this because I wanted something that would be easy to apply so I would use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it used to be on a list of sunscreens with very safe ingredients, though it is no longer on that list because the ingredients may not be so safe if you accidentally breathe it.  I spray my legs and lower arms first, then hold my breath while spraying my upper arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turn the nozzle so that it works in one hand and spray the other hand to apply it to the same arm so I don&#x27;t have to re-adjust it to use it with the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this works because I developed a Vitamin D deficiency (easily fixed with Vitamin D-3 pills).</li>
    <li> This goes on easily, and stays put. But, the key is that it also comes off when you want it to. I tried another type and it was great...except that it was nearly impossible to scrub off in the shower and I&#x27;d end up breaking out.</li>
    <li> If you are gonna spend time in the sun, I would say ignore the price and get this.  Super easy to put on, you don&#x27;t have to rub it in, it is not greasy or sticky, it works great for the kids (should cover eyes as always), and really all that matters is I don&#x27;t get burnt when I wear it.  Surfing, hiking, playing with the kids at the beach, it doesn&#x27;t matter I have never gotten burnt when I put it on.      My bro in law had some of the super nice bullfrog spray the other day before surfing, i tried it.  Not the same, felt like I was putting on a sticky film that dried up strangely.  Not bad though, just not the same.  Kinesys, like I said, is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever used.      It is a really great product...really glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen, especially for my face when biking around town. Goes on light and with the spray you don&#x27;t have to get it on your hands.</li>
    <li> This is the best sun screen I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s greaseless and easy to apply and very effective because it goes subdermal and does not rub off. I had my Dr. check this product and she had no problem with it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a few years.  It works well and even though it seems oily when you first spray it on just give it a few moments and it absorbs and is not greasy at all.  I particularly like it for when I am wearing makeup, but need to reapply Sun screen.  It does not mess up my makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  It is gentle on the skin, and a little goes a long way. On direct areas like face and nose bridge, I spray some on my hands and rub it on to save losing so much to the air by spraying. On dry days that I&#x27;m going outside, I mix a spray or two with my after-shower lotion so that I get both moisturizing and sun block.&lt;br /&gt;This larger size makes it more economical to buy.</li>
    <li> My husband often works outside and hates gooey sticky sunscreen. He loves thus stuff. It goes on like water and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, so he&#x27;s willing to where it whenever he&#x27;s at risk for burns.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes when I purchased KINeSYS spray sunscreen.  In fact, the product is great.  Light and dries to an almost completely non-greasy feel.  That said, the spray bottle is deplorable.  The pump sprayer is cheaply made and you have to hold the bottle in a vertical position, while you pump the sprayer, for it to work at all. Try to manage that while you attempt to apply solution to your ankles!  Unless you have a \\&quot;spray partner\\&quot; to help you out, it isn&#x27;t happening.  If KINeSYS improves the spray pump, I would buy nothing else for sunscreen.  Hence, my two star rating.  But, as is, I would not recommend your purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and it is my favorite sunscreen. No scent so it does not attract the African bees that love to pursue citrus,flowery, and coconut scents.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  It&#x27;s easy to put on.  Fast to apply compare to sunscreen lotion.  It has less toxins compare to other sunscreens too. It doesn&#x27;t leave white residue on the skin.  It&#x27;s oil free so I don&#x27;t have to worry about breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitivity to fragrance used in most sunscreens. I was excited when I read about fragrance free KINeSYS Sunscreen. To me fragrance free mean it is odor free.  Despite the high cost I ordered a bottle.  After spraying a small amount on one hand I immediately noticed a strong fragrance.  It smelled no different then any other sunscreen.  If you don&#x27;t like the fragrance in most suncreen you won&#x27;t like KINeSYS fragrance free Suncreen.</li>
    <li> KINeSYS sunscreens are an absolute godsend for me--I&#x27;ve been allergic to almost every sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried, and the Kinesys sunscreens don&#x27;t provoke me too badly. They seem to do a good job preventing sunburn, although I also try to be careful about spending too much time in direct sunlight. I&#x27;ve used their sunscreens for years, in a lot of different contexts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- winter mountaineering&lt;br /&gt;- kayaking&lt;br /&gt;- camping&lt;br /&gt;- music festivals&lt;br /&gt;- swimming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sticks pretty well, even though I sweat a lot. It has a strange texture at first (sort of slippery/greasy/soapy) that&#x27;s very hard to describe, but once it absorbs, it stays. It doesn&#x27;t leave a pronounced scent once it absorbs, and although my skin feels a little different (in terms of texture), it doesn&#x27;t feel obtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 4oz bottle will hold me through at least a full summer of frequent outdoor activities, so it lasts a long time. For backpacking and travel, I bought the smaller (1 oz) bottle, which I refill at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled that this product exists, and plan to keep using it for as long as they make it. I&#x27;ve used both the regular KINeSYS (white bottle) and the sport/kids version (orange bottle), and I can&#x27;t tell any difference between them in either scent or function.</li>
    <li> pricy but you won&#x27;t regret it. I have a sensitive skin and I used this product comfortably. definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen as my all over, every day sunscreen.  It feels almost like water going on, and once it&#x27;s dry I can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing it.  Since it is pleasant enough to wear all the time, I know I get better protection than if I only put on sunscreen when I knew I&#x27;d be outside for a while.</li>
    <li> We put this in the car, our bike backpacks, every where! you can even use it on your face (don&#x27;t spray it tho) and it doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes. Special bonus? The fave of bald AND hairy guys every where! (you know how you hate to rub that thick stuff on cause it just sits there, right? This doesn&#x27;t.) Avoid that sunburn. A little pricier than some, but worth every penny, year round. Try it at least once.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen.  Previously bought this product at my doctor&#x27;s office.  It does not feel greasy - bought some for extended family, they always borrow mine.</li>
    <li> This is the second Summer we use this sunblock and we have had no burns! It drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this sunscreen because of the great reviews on here, and the Environmental Working Group gave it a very good safety rating. However, I used this on my 2 year old yesterday afternoon before we went out in our yard to play, and this morning, she woke up with a HORRIBLE angry red rash everywhere I had applied it. I had to give her some benadryl to help it go away. She has never had an allergic reaction to anything else so I wouldn&#x27;t consider her to have sensitive skin or anything. I&#x27;m not quite sure what she may be allergic to in this sunscreen, but I will obviously never use it again. I guess I will switch back to the Babyganics brand we used last summer.</li>
    <li> Started using it during an Ironman race.  Didn&#x27;t have to reapply and survived without a burn.  Worked better for my wife than her high end SPF 70 makeup.  Did not hurt the kid&#x27;s eyes or face.</li>
    <li> The spray on feature is great,quick, easy, not messy - perfect for the whole family.</li>
    <li> Like it - not heavy and oily - but still does the job.</li>
    <li> Best out there. Is worth the price. I&#x27;m outdoors all day and have tried many types and names of sunscreen and have had multiple skin cancer. This does not cause any skin reactions and seems to protect alot better than most. very easy to apply, goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> I bought this last summer, along with 5-6 other brands of sunscreen. My 2 year old broke out on her face from most of them (including several very expensive low on the cosmetic database ones) BUt KINeSYS has been great for her. We have used the fragrance free and the mango scent and she has not had any problems with them. I have another friend who also had the same problem and her daughter can use this sunscreen also.    I also LOVE it. It feels very light on my skin and is very easy to reapply. My older kids like it as well, since it takes less time to apply, there is not a lot of rubbing in, and the smell is VERY mild.</li>
    <li> I only buy this sunscreen for my active sailor, wakeboarding, snorkling, swimming son.&lt;br /&gt;He doesn&#x27;t have time for sunscreen and is terrible about re-applying.  I know if I can get him first thing with KineSys before he hits the water, I can relax and know he is not going to come back sunburned.  And it is light weight, doesn&#x27;t smell funny and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Have used this every year for a while. Provides better protection than pretty much any other &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; lotion we&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenient and reliable. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my aesthetician.  It goes on lightly, not greasy. It is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that has a relatively low number of ingredients of concern in the EWG database.</li>
    <li> 10 days on Maui, lots of sun (including a marathon run, lots of pool and ocean time), hypo-allergenic,no sunburn. It just works great in every situation.</li>
    <li> This product works great at protecting the skin from the sun! We have not had a burn or any problems while using it. It sprays on very easily, which is great for squirmy children who do not like being slathered with lotion sunscreen. The spray is light and a little bit oily at first, but it dries onto the skin within a minute or so. It works great in the water too! It has barely any smell which my husband loves, because he has a sensitivity to fragrances.    I&#x27;ve read up on the ingredients and have found it to have a low moderate rating of \\&quot;3\\&quot; on the chemical hazard list (see the EWG&#x27;s website rating -[....]). There are lower hazard sunscreens, but they are the zinc lotion types which require a longer, \\&quot;rubbing in\\&quot; application which my son refuses to put up with.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pricy, but awesome!  It works really well and I love the small spray bottle it comes in.  It sure doesn&#x27;t last long, though!</li>
    <li> Great product. Recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Nice feel, easy to apply. I wish it said broad spectrum on the bottle and not just the write up.</li>
    <li> A perfect combination of sun protection with a good EWG rating. I have been using this sunscreen on my children for about 6 years and they&#x27;ve never had a burn while wearing it. Its easy to apply, and it goes on clear. It is expensive (my husband and I relegate ourselves to cheaper grocery store brands) but it doesn&#x27;t take much to get good coverage. Because it isn&#x27;t an aerosol it&#x27;s easy to aim it where you want it and then just spread any extra around.</li>
    <li> Works great and helped prevent sunburns.</li>
    <li> have used in the past and  like the light feeling an no greasy while look</li>
    <li> This  product is the best for your face as it does not sting your eyes nor cause  breakouts.  A little spray  goes  a long way! Excellent  product!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sunblock that would work for multisport activities and the most important thing I was looking for was breathablity.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for sensitive oily skin, bought specifically to use on my face. I am happy to say that this sunscreen is amazing and the only one that works for me. There&#x27;s very little to no scent, oil free, parabeen free, fragrance free and SPF 30. Its oily at first when applied but dries semi matte on my face (makeup terms Lol) I apply it underneath my makeup and it performs wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t see any oil come through until 5 hours into my day but blotting will take care of that problem. I only gave it 4 stars because of the price.</li>
    <li> I have become more wrinkle conscious lately since hitting 30 and bought this stuff to protect my face. I&#x27;ve used this while running and sweating a lot. It doesn&#x27;t sweat off my face at all. Also, use in Pheonix AZ for a week during August in the pool and I didn&#x27;t get hardly any sun on my face.I did notice that a had a soft glow from the sunscreen layer though. It dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a smell.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or weird on my face. The best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. I even use it on my toddler&#x27;s face and he didn&#x27;t cry at all while using it in the pool. He hates the water babies because it always runs and stings his eyes. So I used water babies on his body and kinysis on his face. It worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a sunscreen that is truly fragrance free, this is the one. It&#x27;s the only sunscreen we use on a daily basis in the humid environment in Florida that doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;sunscreen&#x27; odor. No sunburns when wearing this and it&#x27;s so light once it&#x27;s dry I don&#x27;t even know I have it on. It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth the money for covering exposed areas when going to work, classes, or in and out of stores when shopping. I use a generic at the beach or pool and save the more expensive Kinesys for outings when I just can&#x27;t smell like sunscreen or have to re-apply every hour or so.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  I was looking for an organic sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t make me look like a ghost after I put it on.  I&#x27;m aware that this is not organic and has some iffy ingredients, but it&#x27;s 100 steps ahead anything bought at a box store that has 90 different horrible sounding ingredients.  I feel like this is my happy medium between organic and regular sunscreen.  I like the feel of it and I like that it is a spray.  I even use it on my face, just put it on my hands first.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen every day. A light spray is all you need because it disperses evenly. It is truly unscented and drys without tacky finish. The perfect sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I put it on after every shower, all over any skin that&#x27;s exposed to the sun. Also use it on my face, neck, and chest every morning. It&#x27;s a little oily-feeling at first even though it&#x27;s actually oil-free, then it dries in a few minutes to be almost un-detectable. My eyes are very sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t cause any problems.</li>
    <li> This is one of the highest rated sunscreens on guide guide in terms of it&#x27;s impact on the environment and people. I love using it because it&#x27;s fragrance free (won&#x27;t interfere with my hormones) and alcohol free so it won&#x27;t dry out my skin. I live in AZ so I use this all the time when I&#x27;m doing outdoor activities and it works like a charm. It&#x27;s also vegan and not tested on animals which I love.</li>
    <li> I sometimes work outdoors as a hvac tech. My doc said, \\&quot;no more sun\\&quot;, pre cancer skin...blah blah blah, skin bumps, etc,\\&quot;. So I used standard sunscreens but everyone said to me, \\&quot;are you wearing suntan lotion?\\&quot;  Very embarresing in December.  This product has no odor. Very pricey.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this sunscreen for several years.  I like it because it doesn&#x27;t spray out cold like other spray sunscreens as it&#x27;s not in an aerosol/pressurized bottle.    It&#x27;s the only sunscreen that my kids will use.  Even though the highest SPF seems to be 30,  none of us have got sunburn.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin either.  The only negative is the price.  Costco used to sell it for much cheaper and I used to buy it there but they no long have it.  So now I have to buy it on Amazon.  Even though it&#x27;s expensive, the bottle seems to last a long time.</li>
    <li> I went on the hunt for a sunscreen that would not aggravate my heat rash after having a horrible episode and this works great. I&#x27;ve had issues with other brands that claim to be hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic. I do have to reapply once-twice during the day but that is fine with me. You do have to rub it in after spraying it on and it feels a bit greasy at first (even though I know it&#x27;s oil free). It is expensive but not having to deal with heat rash makes it totally worth the price for me. I will be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> Works well. No weird scent. Low toxicity. Easy to apply. I even bought some small spray bottles and filled them with it and stashed them in my backpack, my car, my travel toiletry kit, so I alway have it handy.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST sunscreen!  A friend recommended this brand to me.  Her dr. suggested it to her.  It doesn&#x27;t break you out...spray it on over make-up or before you apply make-up.  It dries pretty quickly.  This is my go-to EVERY day sunscreen!  Worth every penny.  I buy 3 bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> Best body sunscreen ever! Discovered this from a friend who has an outdoor sporting shop. Used it over a weekend and was hooked. It&#x27;s night and day difference than any other sunscreen. I like it too that it rates pretty decently from an ingredient  standpoint. It&#x27;s better than a lot of expensive sunscreens and for the price it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> this was recommended by Paula Begoun (cosmetics cop) and Its great. Easy application and great coverage.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, I like it because it is not sticky at all, once it drys I can&#x27;t tell that I am wearing it, but it is very effective.  This was the best price I could find, at least $4 under retail.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for a sunscreen of SPF 30 or more that I could use on the thin spot on the top of my head, but found all the ones I tried (mostly aerosol spray products) to be greasy and/or leave the hair in that area looking weird.  Also the ones I tried all had a fragrance to them and I would prefer no odor.  The KINeSYS product is non-greasy, odorless, and is easy to apply.  I spray a little on my fingers and rub it into the scalp.  The hair in that spot looks pretty close to normal when I am done.  It only takes a little bit, so a bottle lasts for  a long time.  I recently spent 4 days in Las Vegas in 107 degree sunny weather all day and did not get a sunburn on my scalp.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever us used. It drys clean and oil free and lasts for a day at the beach or while mountain biking and hiking.</li>
    <li> This stuff work pretty good. Goes on wet/oily but dries fairly quick.Good sun protection.</li>
    <li> Only use this product once but worked great. No greasy residue, no overwhelming smell, great product for runners.</li>
    <li> I searched for a spray sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t full of harmful chemicals (see the safecosmetics database for info on harmful chemicals in sunscreen), and decided to try this product.  My son has very sensitive skin and regular sunscreen burns his skin when it gets wet.  Both of my children like the product and don&#x27;t complain and squirm when they have to put it on.  It goes on very easily without spraying half the product into the air like other sprays do.  It feels light and not \\&quot;goopy.\\&quot;  We spent a week at the beach with no sunburns thanks to this product.  I love it and just re-ordered.  It is well worth the money.  I see it as an investment in my kids&#x27; health - and mine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunblock for the last 5+ years and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use- it&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes when I exercise and lasts for a long time.  Also, the unscented really is unscented, so I don&#x27;t have that terrible beach smell when I go to work!  REI stopped carrying the big bottles, and Amazon has a great price, so I&#x27;ll be buying from here now!</li>
    <li> My husband started breaking out from lotions and sunscreens 3 years ago. This is the only thing we have found that does not bother him. It is expensive but it works well, is not greasy and does not cause breakouts. I have only found it on Amazon but that is fine. Can&#x27;t beat the service!</li>
    <li> great sunscreen.  it does not irritate or make you smell like a coconut.  I prefer the spray.  It allows for a more complete coverage in hard to reach shoulders/back areas.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen hands down.</li>
    <li> have been using it for a long time on all my rides and races - no sunburns, no irritations on my eyes</li>
    <li> Non-toxic and works great!</li>
    <li> I  sprayed product everywhere with no issues with burning or sensitivity, &amp; it sprays on real light even on my face, picky kids loved this sunscreen</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended that I use this product 3 years ago, and it works better than any others that I have tried. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a sunscreen that is truly unscented for a very long time. Even the claimed \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; sunscreens still have that sunscreen smell. I have tried many non-chemical body sunscreens only to be disappointed with application, white residue, hard to wash off because the zinc or titanium particles get in between skin natural wrinkles, etc. This search for a new sunscreen has lead me to Kinesys Sport SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start with the good stuff. This product DOES what it claims. I love the way it makes my skin feel after the product dries. There is literally no sunscreen smell. I have used this spray for all day pool/BBQ parties and never got burnt once with just one application. I found the product to be very water resistant too. For men who have military haircuts or no hair at all, this stuff is awesome for protecting the scalp. Minimal ingredients is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with the somewhat bad stuff that I found. Maybe I spray too much on but it did not take 2-3 minutes to completely dry. I found the time frame to be closer to 8-10 minutes. I also found the spray to originally go on somewhat oily but the oily feel goes away after it dries. Be careful not to spray inside your house because the spray that does not make it on the skin will make it to your floors causing an oily residue. The bottle is only a 4 oz and with the application being a spray, some of the product gets wasted, re-read the floor comment. At the suggested retail price of $18.99, it makes it really hard to recommend to the average consumer. I estimate  6-8 full body applications (dependent on how much you spray for full coverage) for the average size person. BUT Amazon (or 3rd parties) usually sell this product at a discount. Therefore, I highly recommend at the discounted price between $10-15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Will sting your eyes if you sweat. Otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice sunscreen, not too oily and no real smell, this was used for my husband&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> I buy this because it&#x27;s one of the few sunscreens I could find that was scored overall well (3 on a scale of 10, with lower being better) on EWG&#x27;s sunscreen guide and still has most of the things I&#x27;m looking for: it&#x27;s non-comedogenic, it doesn&#x27;t have any micronized zinc or titanium dioxide, it doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of white film (I have olive-tan skin so whiteness doesn&#x27;t blend in well on me), it&#x27;s light and easy to spread, and it has a nice sheen to it that makes my skin look really nice :). it could be less expensive, more effective (according to EWG, only provides \\&quot;good\\&quot; uvb and \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; uva protection, rather than \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; for both - and i can tell that i tan more easily than i have with other sunscreens i&#x27;ve used) and have a lower rated health concern by EWG (currently \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;low\\&quot;), but i&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other sunscreens and based on the things I&#x27;m looking for, this is the best i&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  helpful hint: in order to avoid wasting the amount of product that sprays out to the sides a bit, spray on a cupped hand and spread from there rather than spraying directly onto ur body</li>
    <li> This sunblock is super easy to apply , it has no unpleasant smell and it&#x27;s one of the healthiest spray sunblocks that i found. I have two little girls and their skin  was fine after applying it all summer. It leaves no residue on the skin and dries in seconds. And your child does not look white like a ghost. My only recommendation is that you should  reapply it after long contact with water, since it is not as waterproof as some other sunblocks that i&#x27;ve tested. It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth it. Overall, best sunblock out there, especially for kids and busy moms !!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product....great for sensitive skin.  Hard to find this product in stores.  Will be buying it again</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite sunscreen! It spreads easily, has no smell, and protects my pale freckly skin for hours at the pool. My children prefer it because it doesn&#x27;t feel cold when it goes on and since it isn&#x27;t aerosol, I don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re breathing a bunch in like with other sprays.</li>
    <li> We have used KINeSYS sunscreen spray for years without a complaint, especially because it is one of the few spray sunscreens that gets a decent rating from EWG.org. For some reason, though, this year, I&#x27;ve been disappointed. I live in the Southeastern USA, so the sun is hot and direct in the summer. I went to the pool with my daughter and adult cousin about a month ago. I used a different, more expensive zinc-based sunscreen on my daughter (because it gets an even better rating from EWG) and my cousin and I both used KINeSYS. After an hour in the pool, we all reapplied our sunscreen, stayed for another hour, then went home. My cousin and I both burned on our shoulders and arms - not badly, but enough to experience some pain. My daughter did not burn anywhere, but she tans easily so it may not have been a fair test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of weeks after, my family went to Florida. I had some extra KINeSYS which I loaned to some extended family members, and once again, those who used it burned slightly, while those of us using the zinc-based spray did not. For the price, this is good stuff without a ton of toxic chemicals, but I&#x27;m going to spend the money for a bit more protection in the future.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve never used another sunscreen after finding this one. Not oily, lasts forever, works great.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a superior sunscreen minus the toxic chemicals.  And I needed it to be easy to apply - preferably a spray.  I thought this would be it.  But it did not work for me.  I gave it several tries.  Maybe I got a bad batch.</li>
    <li> Like all of us, we&#x27;re all on a quest for a sunscreen that&#x27;s not too heavy; not too thick; not too smelly, and doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes. For me, KINesys is the one I put on every day, right after shaving. There may be \\&quot;Better\\&quot; sunscreens out there, but if you&#x27;re not willing to wear them every day, they won&#x27;t protect you while still in the tube.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen.  Very light weight, not greasy, but moisturizing. All natural so no worries about chemicals.  Waterproof.  I&#x27;ve worn this on many trips to tropical locations and it works the best.  Buy this!</li>
    <li> Awesome product .... my dermatologist reccommends this and it really works!!&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to keep applying every few hours either .... just twice a day!!</li>
    <li> This product does not dry your skin</li>
    <li> This product worked (as far as I can tell), and I found the pump dispenser to be easy to use. The sunscreen dried to a slightly shiny surface on my 60-year-old pale skin. The biggest drawback I found, and why I dumped an ounce of it down the drain, was the way it helped create clogs in my pores. I developed multiple acne-type lesions. They are healing nicely since I stopped using the product a couple of days ago.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen.  The best!!!  It goes on easy.  Its clear so no white mess.  Lasts at least half a day even when it gets wet.  I never sunburn.  It lasts a long time.  High quality and safe.  Get this - no question.</li>
    <li> Kinesys is the best sunscreen I have used. Coverage is fairly easy with the pump sprayer and after it sets, you don&#x27;t get the greasy sheen you get with some products. It also rates very highly on ewg.org/2013sunscreen for quality of protection on UVA, UVB and balance protection, and low health risk.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it is a bit expensive. But the low health risk score makes it workwhile.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. Well, as much as anyone can love sunscreen. It is the only spray on sunscreen that I have found that does not leave my skin feeling greasy. Even when I am out all day and apply layers on top of each other, I do not notice a sticky or greasy feeling. Another bonus with the Kinesys brand is it is available fragrance free. The only problem I have with this product is finding it in stores. I am so glad Amazon carries this product.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend 5 years ago.  Now it is all we use. No smell,  covers well and does the job!</li>
    <li> This is a good sunscreen, goes on a little oily but quickly soaks in and dries up pretty well.  Was very highly rated on one sunscreen review I saw on the net a year ago.  It seems expensive, but a little goes a long way, so I think it&#x27;s pretty competitive, if not cheaper than most good sunscreens.  The fragrance-free version really is fragrance-free.  Seems to work well, I use it for everyday, biking, and kayaking.  It does NOT stain clothing!  As noted in a few other reviews, the pump sprayer does malfunction at times.  Since I use it every day, I buy 4 at a time, and if one sprayer malfunctions, I just use a different one and pour the remaining product into that bottle.  This has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful sunscreen.  It is clear and a fast absorbed liquid that really protects.  Quality ingredients and broad spectrum.</li>
    <li> Great product! I thought it was rather expensive but, once I tried it, I understood what the positive reviewers were talking about. It&#x27;s not oily at all. No perfume. No alcohol. No lotion mess. And it absorbs almost instantly. It&#x27;s true: you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I live in Hawaii and I&#x27;ve discovered this is my favorite sunscreen. No scent, feels like silk. I Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Glad I can get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It was first recommended to me by my skin dr.  We live in Arizona, sun most every day.  I use this every day, and routinely see my dermatoligst every six months. Prior to using this product I had some facial skin operations and removal of basical and squamish cells. Since using KineSys spf 30, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I am a active 75 year old who golfs, walks, bikes, and flies RC sailplanes, all outside activities.  I have recommended this to my friends, and told them to buy it on line,  It is hard to find sometimes.</li>
    <li> Its really work and didn&#x27;t burn my eyes&lt;br /&gt;i wish if they make it more stronger SPF 50 or more</li>
    <li> Recommended by Australian institute as the best in spray. Great for runners: won´t feel sticky or anything else. Seems like having nothing at all and you´re protected from the sun.I do everyday runs, many in southern Europe where I live.</li>
    <li> my dermatologist recommended this as a skin conditioner ss well as sun blocker.  expensive at drugstore but worth every penny at Amazon prices.  another amazing product from our Canadian neighbors.</li>
    <li> goes on easy: very little smell, love that it&#x27;s not oily</li>
    <li> VERY effective, without being greasy or smelly.  Easy to spray onto my balding scalp, where I need it most.  For my nose and under my eyes, I spray it onto a finger and apply it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sunscreen! It&#x27;s light, not oily or tacky, no breakouts from using it and it is a safer sunscreen (in terms of being low in chemicals) than most. A little goes a long way. I spray it in my hands and apply. One spray usually provides plenty of coverage for my face. I have very sensitive skin and this never bothers me. Great for kids too - never a complaint when we use this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a reasonably hairy guy, so most sunscreens just don&#x27;t penetrate and are hard and messy to put on.  Kinesys gets in there easy.  Now, you may not be hairy, but you should be screening around your hairline on your head and this makes it easy.  The squirt bottle also helps me get the middle of my back if I&#x27;m alone.  So, convenience is high.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found Kinesys to be good at resisting sweat (my marathon running friends swear by it) and it is easy to re-apply.  Additionally, it&#x27;s easy to put on my baby son and doesn&#x27;t irritate him.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a little pricey, but if I have a different sunscreen, I won&#x27;t use it, and not getting burnt is worth $20 to me anytime.  Thumbs up for Kinesys.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best sunscreen for my skin type. It also works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shared it with friends that are also sold on this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best sunscreen protectant on the market.  Sure it costs a little more, but it goes on well and you can&#x27;t even feel it!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite sunscreen. It is light and doesn&#x27;t make you hot and sticky in warm, humid conditions. Yes it costs more than the national brands at the drug store but you get it back in comfort while laying back and reading or going for a long distance bike ride in hot humid conditions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this sunscreen, and I plan to continue using it.  I use it on my face and body and have had no reaction and no sunburn.  And I do burn easily.  I recommend that you spray it outside or be very careful spraying it into your hand so that the spray does not  end up on your floor where it can leave slippery spots.</li>
    <li> All is good here.No issues.Fast shipping.Packs really well.What more can I ask more.AAAAAAAAAA</li>
    <li> Great stuff that is not greasy and goes on well.</li>
    <li> I work outside and use sunscreen every day.  This product is far and away the best sunscreen product I have ever bought, no exaggeration.  In the hot desert sun, 95+ every day and I&#x27;m a white white guy and this has protected me from burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price seems high, but a little goes a long way.  Maybe 3 pumps to cover my whole face and neck, and 3 more for each arm.  This will last a good while.  I have already ordered a second bottle because I don&#x27;t want to be caught without, but I have used my current bottle daily for the whole summer and still have quite a bit left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not oily or greasy, it does feel a little silky right when you first apply it but that goes away within a minute.  It in no way greases your hands or affects your grip for the short time that it&#x27;s on there.  When used on the face, it stays in place and there are no alcohol or fragrance fumes to make your eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels a little odd to get passionate about something like a sunscreen, but after trying literally dozens of other products, when I find something so completely effective and satisfying, I feel like I should shout it from the mountaintops.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best active/water sunscreen that I have found.  I&#x27;m not into putting a ton of nasty chemicals onto my skin or that of my kids.  We&#x27;ve tried just about every low toxicity including most of the top EWG picks.  Kinesys may not be the top of EWGs list (it received a 3 rating) but it is the easiest to put on.  It goes on smooth and absorbs fast. It won&#x27;t leave you looking like a ghost or feeling like you&#x27;ve bathed in oil.</li>
    <li> I am very active and outdoors a lot, and I had already decided that this is the best sunblock to use for biking, hiking, etc. it is easy to apply, love that it&#x27;s fragrance free and has fairly benign ingredients, as far as sunblocks go. Buying it on Amazon saved me a good amount of money, because it&#x27;s not cheap. But a little bit goes along way, so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  I work outside for my job and this makes my job much easier in dealing with the bugs and the sun.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been buying KINeSYS sunscreen for a few years, ever since my husband used some that a friend of his had at an all-day outdoor music festival. My husband hates anything that is greasy or sticky on his skin, and he absolutely raved about this product. We&#x27;ve been buying it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance-free version is great since it&#x27;s more gender-neutral than the mango scent.  The bottle is small, but the spray distributes it well, so it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem we&#x27;ve had is that my husband sweats a lot, and he&#x27;s gotten burned before when playing beach volleyball and using this (even though it&#x27;s designed for performance).  For regular use, though, it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, but is a really excellent product!</li>
    <li> It works. It is very slippery to put on and if you get any on the bottle, the bottle will be difficult to hold. It absorbs into the skin after a few minutes and becomes unnoticeable. I have fair skin and I don&#x27;t get sunburned with it, so it is effective. It just a bit expensive for 4 ounces. It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my acne worse.</li>
    <li> Does not clog pores. It feels light and breathable.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this sunscreen at a golf pro shop, where they are serious about protection. I find KINeSYS is great for my face, light but effective. I use it every day before I put on any make-up and have been reordering&lt;br /&gt;It as I finish a bottle.</li>
    <li> Never have any issues with this including burns. Been using it for years, and will never go elsewhere. Thank you</li>
    <li> I wore this on a 40 mile bike ride in full sun and didn&#x27;t even get so much as a tan line. It was 92 out and I was sweating like a hog. Stayed put like a champ, no blindness from running into my face.</li>
    <li> works great, not sticky or stinky. I love the spray application- non-aerosol but goes on evenly and doesn&#x27;t clog in the bottle</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me this was a great sunscreen for long distance biking because he can apply it while he is riding. I tried it one day when I was outside with my kids. Were were in the direct sun for hours. My 1 year old is very fair and will not wear a hat. I was really worried she was going to burn. Even though we only applied the sunscreen once and were sweating all day, no one got burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen works really well, and you can barely feel it on your skin after it evaporates. The skin absorbs it quickly and it does not feel greasy. Finally, I found a sunscreen that does not get into kids eyes when they sweat. Just remember to spray on to your own hands and then rub a small bit on kiddo&#x27;s face, so it does not get near eyes during the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw negative comments about the spray mechanism. It is normal when a sprayer is not an aerosol for it to be a bit harder to spray. You have it keep the bottle upright while spraying, but at least the sprayer is environmentally friendly. Just spray sunscreen on you hands first, then rub on skin to apply to ankles, back of neck or other hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works better than any sunscreen I have ever bought, I am very impressed!</li>
