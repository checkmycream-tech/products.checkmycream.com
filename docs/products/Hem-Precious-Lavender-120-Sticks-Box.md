<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this fragrance- it smells like a nice heady lavender.  It&#x27;s not too overpowering and great for relaxation</li>
    <li> this is the largest box of incense I have ever held in my hand and it smells magnificent.  yum</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this brand of incense. Has poor fragrance. Myself and friends agree.</li>
    <li> This has become my night time favorite in the bedroom. Very relaxing and sleep inducing.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon...&lt;br /&gt;Jo-Ann</li>
    <li> This has a clean and present smell. Got a lot for the the order. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Like the smell -- but incense pieces tend to be irregular; break easily &amp; do not burn evenly!</li>
    <li> really great aroma, best I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
    <li> I have used Hem lavender for years I&#x27;m think this batch did not get dipped long enough there was hardly a scent to them.&lt;br /&gt;Sucks because I have 120 non scented sticks.</li>
    <li> Good Quality...but I don&#x27;t like lavender...so it&#x27;s my fault for buying it</li>
    <li> These are so earthy, and comforting. I love to light them at night, when I am winding down. They&#x27;re not that fake-ish lavender smell, like some other companies offer, these are the real deal, but not too overpowering. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> What can you say about stick incense except that it smells good and it does not go out until it reaches the end of the incense. And, it leaves relatively little ash. This product does all these things. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use around children or newborns.</li>
    <li> What a great buy. Makes a great gift as well. Smells terrific and lasting.</li>
    <li> I thought it might be more of a smell of Lavender.</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised.  However, I have since found a product of equal quality at a MUCH BETTER PRICE.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and exquisite fragrance and packaging.  I love that a lovely, delicate fragrance lingers long after the incense stick has been consumed.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different incense over the past few years and by far, this is my very favorite.  When I am done with a stressful day, I turn to this incense to take the edge off.  It is also a very nice to burn while taking a hot bath.  It is my go to incense now, knocking super hit into the second place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are hand rolled and will have imperfections and some very minimal inconsistencies.  This can easily be overlooked because it is the best smelling stuff around.  The only issue I really have is that the slight inconsistency with the stick size sometimes makes it a challenge to install it in my incense burner.  Who cares, I just get creative with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how long one stick will burn, forty-five minutes to an hour per my estimate.  Give or take a few minutes.  I suppose this is not an exact science due to the hand rolling, as some sticks are thicker than others.  Mine certainly does not burn for hours, as stated by another reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy lavender essential oil, you will surely enjoy this incense.  The scent is true and real and reminiscent of my bottle of essential oil housed in my cabinet.  It is a wonderful relaxing scent that instantly calms me and brings me a very serene feeling.</li>
    <li> It lights up good burns good but the lavender its a little to intense almost like a spray can intense, I was looking for an aroma that sneaks up on you and it lingers softly in your nose, It might be better for outdoors use. Even the Nag Champa that has a strong aroma is more smooth than this one. Not a bad product but just not for me.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed upon first opening the package of sticks.  They smelled like medicine, not Lavender.  HOWEVER, upon lighting, the wonderful aroma of Lavender filled the room and the stick burns slowly for several minutes.  Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good, definately not overpowering. Burn 20+ mins.</li>
    <li> This is high quality incense and love the lavender scent.  We use it by the pool to keep mosquitoes away.  It is effective and smells better than citronella.</li>
    <li> Use every day in my office</li>
    <li> Smells and burns great. So many sticks for the price! I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
    <li> have ordered before I think the price as reduce because they were old</li>
    <li> Great smells. Love the lavender.</li>
    <li> great incense, great smell</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent and great to use after cooking!</li>
    <li> This particular brand has cured me of the desire to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought other scents from HEM and liked them. Sadly I bought a box full of this one and while loath to toss them out, I really can&#x27;t handle it.</li>
    <li> Nothing particularly special about this. Maybe I&#x27;m just not a floral incense person. I think the scent is very strong so you definitely can get away with using only half of a stick if it&#x27;s in a small space.</li>
    <li> I Love the precious Lavender Sticks they are easy to light and smell very nice.  I use them for my prayers.  One stick is enough to make the whole house smell so nice. They can also be use after you have cooked a meal with a strong smell, once in a while I do&lt;br /&gt;light one stick in my kitchen.</li>
    <li> Using these for bedtime. Timely delivery. No damage. No problems.</li>
    <li> HEM has another great incense with its lavender scent -- truly a joy (as are the other HEM incense aromas I have tried)! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> All of the above was bought by me. I will tell you once again make sure the package say HEM wrapped. MOst of the incense comes from India if it comes from some place in the US it might not be genuine.</li>
    <li> I leave one burning while I leave in the morning and when I come back, it invites me to meditate. Excellent product, recommended.</li>
    <li> These are utterly fantastic.</li>
    <li> Was awesom as extra hand out gifts as well as stocking stuffers. Thanks Santa.</li>
    <li> Use it regularly--very nice scent.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> This rose incense smells SO bad I threw it away. It&#x27;s almost as bad as burning hair... I walked outside, then back inside (hoping I was over reacting at first), and it still smelled bad... it was like walking in to a hair salon.  I think i&#x27;m just going to stay away from HEM incense.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell but it&#x27;s overwhelming too strong for my liking</li>
    <li> these are best used when you have roomates and one of those roomates have pets. one or two lite and ready in two different sections burning throughout the house,the scent is nice and relaxing not over powering and the sheer ammount they give in this large box set is enough to last a month and a half maybe two. i&#x27;m half way through my first box and i got this a little while back, i plan to buy more, i kinda wish more flavors were primed and ready in a deal like this.</li>
    <li> great product! smell is pungent but very nice!</li>
    <li> Such a good deal, but the scent is terrible to me. I like the smell of lavender, but this has a pungent synthetic floral smell that gives me a raging headache. Reminds me of bad women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell as I&#x27;d hoped. Not terrible but not great either. Might just be a personal preference thing.</li>
    <li> A great value!  Love these!</li>
    <li> good product, nice lavender smell. very very strong, so recommendation don&#x27;t use in a small room! pleased with it though</li>
    <li> I like Hem over all the other affordable brands. You get a good amount for the price and the scents they offer always have a good aroma. I like the Lavender and it is one of many favorites.</li>
    <li> The scent provides a relaxing environment/</li>
    <li> These guys are strong. I only need to burn one stick in my 2100 sq house once a week or even once every other week and it makes it smell great.</li>
    <li> My son loves it to cover up room smells!</li>
    <li> love the smell. will be getting more</li>
    <li> The very best you will not run out the amount was great for the money I will not run out</li>
    <li> The Smell last and last and last :) it&#x27;s awesome !!!! Love it  !!!! Came in the mail sooner than expected  !!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent I love it can&#x27;t beat price or quality. !!!!! lightning speed delivery will order again</li>
    <li> Wow man I came home from vacation and like the incense look beat up by an angry gorilla.  Like man if you care, you treat my incenses like you care for cool breeze on a hot day.  Karma is not good, wake up man and see the sun for the moon and you will understand that you can never escape your crimes of pretending to be a machine when you are really a person!  I look at myself in the ice and see my breath and I forgive you.  Can you forgive yourself from the shame, man?</li>
    <li> really need a holder to burn at least 3 joss sticks at a time as well.</li>
    <li> As usual with all the incense I&#x27;ve ordered, a lot of the sticks came to small to where it didn&#x27;t stay in the hole, I have three different incensed holders and none of them will hold the tiny width without using another stick to keep it in the hole....</li>
    <li> It burns really fast but better than the other kind of incense I bought from Amazon site.  The aroma lingers around for days where it was burned.  The aroma is pungent and nice.  It soothes me and calm me down a bit especially when you walk around the area after a day or two it was burned, you can still sort of smelling the nice aroma in the air.</li>
    <li> Bought as a quick add-on to get the free shipping. Love the smell. My roommate wanted to swap as soon as she smelled them.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like lavender. Junk.</li>
    <li> Just great and I love it</li>
    <li> I have bought incense before on Amazon and was really disappointed with the smell(not Amazons fault) its the chance you take when ordering something you need to try out first. These were rated very high and deserve it. The smell is pleasant and perfect lavender incense. I grew up in Berzerkly (Berkeley, Ca) and have been around incense most of my life and this is one the best I have had. Its perfect for my prayer station and great for even just having a mellow scent surround the house. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> great product wonderful company to deal with</li>
    <li> Love the smell and came quickly.</li>
    <li> Did not smell like LAVENDER. Smelled like smoke. First time purchase. Maybe I got a bad batch. Would purchase again to be sure  but not LAVENDER.</li>
    <li> They smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> If want a smell that is REAL lavender and nothing else, this is NOT for you. They have some great ones, this is not one of them.</li>
    <li> Cheap incense to have on hand in the bathroom</li>
    <li> Burns a long time and out out a good amount. Great price. I like the individual containers</li>
    <li> With the caveat that fragrance is to the nose what beauty is to the eye of the beholder, my nose loves the mélange of intensity and delicacy of the scent of this lavender incense. It not only smells divine, it also burns with a minimum of smoke and the little smoke it does produce doesn&#x27;t seem to trigger my asthma the way most incense does. The fragrance lingers a long time after burning too. And to top it off, the current price of just under $6.00 for 120 sticks is a such a steal I&#x27;m ordering another box as soon as I finish typing.</li>
    <li> They smell great! SO many sticks for the low price!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that there are 120 to a box but they burn very quickly and don&#x27;t have a very strong aroma. I use them in my bedroom and exercise room when doing yoga.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. I love the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> I looked long and hard for a good lavender incense to buy.  When I tried out this lavender incense, I was pleasantly surprised.  It smells wonderful.  The smell is deep, strong, and rich.  It makes the atmosphere of the house more relaxed and pleasant.  It is very calming and a joy to smell.  HEM makes some very good incense.</li>
    <li> AND AT A BARGAIN SINCE I HAVE THIS ELSEWHERE  AND IT HAS COST MUCH MUCH MORE THAN THIS. THIS MERCHANT WILL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN AND I HIGHLY RECOMEND HIM</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already rated these items.&lt;br /&gt;The have better a fragrance then the Lavender cone I  just bought.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given a friend a few sticks to use in their homes, they really enjoy them.</li>
    <li> O.K. weird smell... But my students seem to enjoy it and my roommates do as well. It&#x27;s not horrible. but Not lavender.</li>
    <li> I know prefer these over the air freshen products I buy. These burn for a little less than an hour and have a very pleasant, potent scent that will spread all over your house within seconds of lighting these beauties. For the price and how long these will last I find them a much better deal than your typical air freshening product</li>
    <li> Nothing make your house smell better</li>
    <li> very nice, sort of iffy sometimes about almost getting rejects, might have to relight, several times, could be worth the money</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling incense ever. However, I don&#x27;t believe it actually smells like lavender. But it does have a wonderful scent. I buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> The lavender scent is fairly strong, which I like, and is accurate to what real lavender smells like. The scent will linger in the room long after they have burned. The sticks burn slow and came packaged nicely.  Really can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> Smells like cheap soap.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these incenses. They smell really good to me. The scent is not too overpowering and I&#x27;ve noticed that the scent lingers for quite some time after burning which I like.</li>
    <li> They smell amazing,  til you burn them. It smells like burnt plastic. It&#x27;s awful. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite incense scent. I ordered a huge box of it hoping it will last me a while. :)</li>
    <li> We love the scent of Nag Champa, and wanted to change things up a little, so we tried this one out...  The verdict is in: We love it! Our family loves lavender scent... It is perfect.. well made, lasts long, great price for high quality incense.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. Fills the whole room and lingers well after it&#x27;s been burned. Just wish they would last a little longer. They burn fairly quickly but for the price and quantity/quality, can&#x27;t complain. All in all, a good buy. Will likely buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Its aroma is really good but its not that lasting. Apart from that other things are really good and  I like it.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to how many there was when I added to my cart, but this is an insane amount of lavender incense. Luckily, I absolutely love the way these smell. They are super subtle and not terribly smoky smelling. I burn them with palo santo sticks, and it&#x27;s very relaxing.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like lavender</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of incense but use it occasionally. I was hesitant to purchase this since I couldn&#x27;t smell it before buying. I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a chance. It is truly the best smelling incense I&#x27;ve ever had. My husband (who actually hates incense) loves it also. The only complaint I have is that some of the boxes must have been smashed at some point because when I opened the package, the incense itself had come apart from the stick part and the bottom of some of the sticks were separated, no matter it is still a great deal considering you get 120 sticks which breaks down to very little$ per stick.</li>
    <li> Great incense but burns fast. So I use body oils to prolong.</li>
    <li> I am a frequent purchaser of incense and am always looking for less expensive ways to feed my addiction to the fragrance and atmosphere that incense adds to a room This one is a decent quality and at a good price. Product was delivered as promised. Though it is not a heavy lavender and I have to burn 2 sticks at a time to get a good fragrance, it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> They burn a little quicker than the gourmet burning sticks.</li>
    <li> Burned one stick and had a TOXIC Experience.  Became extremely ill with headache.  I&#x27;m an avid incense burner, but this product was unsafe for me.</li>
    <li> I love this smell and just love all the hem incense, i have tried so many of there&#x27;s and they offer great quality and would order these again for sure !!! Love there dragons blood and also the moon , both are alos super great scents !!!</li>
    <li> OK, not as great a smell as the Sandal wood.</li>
    <li> Nice, but very perfumey. I prefer the patchouli!</li>
    <li> I like the sweet smell of these incense sticks. I thought it would smell a bit more like lavendar but it&#x27;s more of a scented sweet scent. I do enjoy them and I think the price is great for the amount you get!!</li>
    <li> smells awesome, burns as what expected for incense. Packing is unique to the smell of incense, just love it, can&#x27;t say anything else about it. Came when promised and I have no complaints</li>
    <li> This item has a perfume like scent not a traditional lavender scent.  It reminds me of the old perfume soap my grandmother would use.  I use lavender essential oils and grow lavender plants so I know what fresh lavender smells like.  This item does not smell like the other lavender items I use.  The smell was so strong that I could smell it before I even opened the box.  If you like the perfume scented lavender then this item is for you.  If you like the traditional scent of fresh lavender then look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Boy I went thru this stuff fast.  I was afraid scent would be too strong for me but Husband suggested it.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of their lavender incense.  The price is great.  The shipping is very fast.  I use their incense just about every day and leaves a great aroma.</li>
    <li> this is very disappointed.  It smell nothing like lavender at all, and even produce a burn smell.</li>
    <li> Loved this purchase more then what I expected. You can not go wrong buying incense. Very very pleased. Highly recommended to all.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the smell of this incense. I had hoped that I made a good purchase and I did. Yay!</li>
    <li> The quality was amazing, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this incense is quite mild but it burns fast. I would recommend but just know it burns much faster than other incense I use.</li>
    <li> i took a chance on this incense and this brand and it smells so good, you definately smell the Lavender even before you burn it and it fills the entire room, this isnt the first time i bought this brand and will continue to do so :)</li>
    <li> This is a VERY strong smell! If you don&#x27;t like lavender, don&#x27;t even think about ordering this product. It burns great and is very fragrant!</li>
    <li> Too floral and does not stay lit, looks like it is but then it punks out. would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I first started to burn incense when I took a trip to Spain, I bought some at the local market, but I didn&#x27;t start burning it until i came back to the USA. The incense I bought there was lavender, and it smelled great. After that I always burned incense in my house, and when I saw that amazon sold the same incense I had to get some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This incense is my favorite out of any I have tried, The sent is not to strong, and burns nice and slowly.(about 30-45 min). Plus i only paid $4.76 for the box of 6, 20 stick boxes, that a great deal compared to some of the other incenses that can go for $12+ for 120 sticks. It has a nice floral sent, not exactly like Lavender, but still smells great. I use this incense when I am reading or just relaxing. You just have to be  careful when you are taking the incense out of the box, because the actual incense stick will get all over your hands and stains your cloths. I would highly recommend this product, or any of Hems incense.</li>
    <li> Smells like lavander but it has a hint of musk in it. Very masculine smelling. Doesn&#x27;t put out too much smoke but gives out a good scent.</li>
    <li> repeat customer so that says it all</li>
    <li> Yum!  Love the relaxing scent.  Has a great scent before you burn them and during.  I will definitly buy again</li>
    <li> Not great, not bad, just mediocre.  I could not rate this incense higher because the scent is not very strong, it is very smoky, and while it does smell of Lavender, the scent is not as &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;detailed&amp;#34; as I had hoped for; however, the price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if one were curious, I&#x27;d say buy it for use or as a gift, it&#x27;s not a bad product, but it could be better.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell. It is extremely potent and remains on the furniture, window treatments, rugs for weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it was a good deal. I ordered several scents and they all smell fine. It&#x27;s a lot of incense sticks for the money but they burn very dark.  Like, I bought some other stuff off of here and the smoke is very clean, the smoke from these sticks is black.  The kind that leaves ash and soot on stuff...  It&#x27;s almost like burning plastic type smoke?  I think this would be a good purchase for a store that wants to sell incense. It&#x27;s packaged for resale.</li>
    <li> These are ok but not great.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I purchased too much of a good thing! Although it is great, the next time I order, I think I would order Jasmine, and Gardenia. I will probably  be good for a while though!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again, for being my favorite store. Always prompt, always patient w/me!&lt;br /&gt;Janet L Dickens</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened my mailbox I knew this was a STRONG scented one. I love HEM incense and one of the reasons is because it&#x27;s so strong, but this is doubly so. I recently gotten the big box of rose and loved it, and since I also love lavender I got this expecting it to be similar. Unlike the rose this isn&#x27;t very flowery smelling, and smells mostly like good generic incense. It would be great for covering up orders, but HEM makes much more enjoyable scents that smell more like what they are going for.</li>
    <li> I love it, my fiance loves it, everyone who has smelled it loves it, took it to the Temple and the Zen Master even liked it. Buy it and love it yourself! It does indeed smell like lavender, and not like artificial chemical junk.</li>
    <li> Ok smell; there were a lot here, but the smell was just ok.</li>
    <li> So awesome, at such a good price</li>
    <li> Nice smell but potent stuff! Just putting the package in my closet released the aroma. Not as subtle or refined as the Japanese stick incense I&#x27;m used to. Just a different sensibility.</li>
    <li> Prime shipping, so received it quickly. Everyone in the house loves this scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering- it&#x27;s light and lovely.</li>
    <li> Long-lasting and you get 120 of them!!  You can&#x27;t beat this offer.  These are not imitation and are just like the ones I buy when I get the single packages of 20 at the store.  I love these</li>
    <li> Great value and prompt shipping</li>
    <li> Very soft and pleasant aroma. Helps me relax after a long day at work!</li>
    <li> ships fast Smells Great will order again</li>
    <li> A lot of it for less. Will last a long time. Very good scent. Great as a gift for who loves incense.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t hate this, I actually didn&#x27;t mean to order it so I had no expectations, I just saw it in my box of incenses and used it. It does not resemble lavender to me, it has a floral scent that is not offensive but it isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d expect if you are looking for lavender fields. I think lavender inherently does not lend itself to incense because of incense&#x27;s smoky nature, something that doesn&#x27;t really describe lavender. It&#x27;s definitely a great price, you get a ton of incense. Maybe another scent of theirs would be better.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my home. it really smells great and for the price, you get a good amount. I would recommend to anyone looking for this type of product.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve used moderate quality incense and have experienced the pure natural smells of them, you will dislike these as much as I do. If incense were beer, these would be keystone; not really enjoyable, but serve their purpose. These smell like burning perfume, nauseating and headache inducing. Don&#x27;t buy these, please, for the love of God.</li>
    <li> I love the calmness the great smell of incense inspires. I need to relax, and use incense to help me. Of course, my neighbor cooks food from a country that is very poor. Even though she is here in the US, she cooks as if she is still in that poor country. So the food smells terrible to me. The scent gets into the hall and my apartment. The incense eradicates this smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and got a package a week later. The receipt matched what I had ordered. Though, inside my package was a completely different order. Now I am an unsatisfied customer and I have to re-mail the unwanted product. This is a huge inconvenience. I have to wait even longer for my product. My whole situation seems a little sketchy.</li>
    <li> Excellent and prontly service</li>
    <li> The fragrance is nice but the ash spread all over quite messy even though I put it in the large glass container .</li>
    <li> Love the lavender smell.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell. It relaxes me before going to bed.</li>
    <li> These smell really good and I don&#x27;t even like lavender like that. So many for such a good price. I will be ordering from here again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll use it, but the sticks are so incredibly thin they will barely stand. I&#x27;ve bought HEM many times, but all of those had adequate stick size. I won&#x27;t buy this again. Aroma is weak too.</li>
    <li> Hem products seem to be very high quality with most pleasant smells</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell and they last a fairly long time.  Plus, the ash doesn&#x27;t migrate a lot so there is little to no &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; other than dumping the incense burner.</li>
    <li> Smells super yummy. I love burning incense and there is a LOT of incense in the one box, I haven&#x27;t even gotten through one tube after burning incense every day for a month.</li>
    <li> Love lavender. This is nice not perfummy.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of lavender. It&#x27;s always been my favorite. I would recommend this to anyone who&lt;br /&gt;was a wanna be hippy like I am.</li>
    <li> Nice slow burn with a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lavender incense..it smells really great and has enough to last me a long time.  I will definitely be making more purchase of this!</li>
    <li> I love how these smell. Very authentic!</li>
    <li> Will buy again after supply runs out, price good, delivery free, fragrance is nice</li>
    <li> they smelled fabulous</li>
    <li> This incense burns nicely and fills the house up with a soothing lavender scent. Good price too, will order again.</li>
    <li> Inconsistent. Some stick have stronger Fragrances than others; some are smokey while others aren&#x27;t. They have a clean smell which is nice.</li>
    <li> This is and amazing scent, actually one of my favorites and its hard to find, so glad I found it on amazing! It was ship FAST! I was very happy and pleased. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender to me... If you want the smell of lavender flowers or pure lavender essential oil, this isn&#x27;t the incense for you. It&#x27;s very powdery... almost like a floral-scented baby powder. Not what I was looking for. It is not true to real lavender.</li>
    <li> my favorite by hem so far</li>
    <li> Smells really good.  This is my first time purchasing Lavender incense.  It is in my regular rotation.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, while these sticks smelled pretty good in the package, once out the lavender aroma disappeared.  When lit, my wife had the same reaction I had, saying they smelled like an electrical fire.  When I told here they were supposed to be lavender, she laughed.  Worse yet, they are quite smokey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I cannot recommend these.</li>
    <li> Very strong smell, but it is also very calming incense.  My son loves the smell. I am so glad I pick the Lavender incense.</li>
    <li> not a strong lavender aroma, and a lot like bathwater rather than lavender. sticks hard to light and quite slender. ok for the price but not to be bought again</li>
    <li> Pleasant enough but not very strong or authentic lavender smell...so so</li>
    <li> I have been using this product...same manufacturer. It is about 1/2 the price when I buy in person.  This was I save on gas and get quick delivery to my home!  LAVENDER is a claming scent and I also use lavender oil. Will always order this from Amazon, it&#x27;s a win win situation!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of lavender....these sticks have a pretty good aroma....nor the best that I have purchased, but pretty darned good...</li>
    <li> The perfume was overwhelming and not at all the smell of lavendar.</li>
    <li> I love these lavender incense sticks. They are great for lifting your mood.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing negative about them is some of the ends are very thin and they don&#x27;t sit well in incense holders.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let this stop you from buying, most of them will fit well in your incense holder.</li>
    <li> The package of incense is well made and burns for a long time.  The aroma is pure and not overwhelming.  I love keeping a few burning most of the day!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of lavender and find that it is soothing and healing. I have tried different types of lavender I cense and this is the only one that I really like. I burn it every day in my home and office and find that it really does help me to let go of stress and just enjoy the scent. I use it when I practice yoga and at the end of yoga for relaxation. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Good scent and not over powering.</li>
    <li> They are not to strong and I enjoy burning them though out my home and office. They will do well in any setting</li>
    <li> Very nice smell, burns for 30 minutes, but is very, very thin.  the incense on the stick is just barely there on the stick.  In my opinion it should be thicker, more incense to cover the wooden stick.  The packaging is very fancy and nice, they should not waste money on such fancy packaging but make the incense thicker so that it would burn more smoke.  The way it is it is thin and small amount of smoke comes out.  I use them in my garden, I personally feel it should be thicker to emit more smoke.  The smell is great.  Seller is prompt and reliable.</li>
    <li> These are great! Very long lasting scent even after hours of burning out. I&#x27;ll def buy more very, very soon.</li>
    <li> Hit and mix with this box, some may smell the lavender and others in the box you can barley smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure the scent is Lavender but whatever it is, it&#x27;s WONDERFUL, strong and lasting and a delight every time I smell it. I&#x27;m very happy with this incense and add it on every order that qualifies (over $25).</li>
    <li> Love to use this Lavender incense which has a true smell of lavender, won&#x27;t need anymore for years.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like Lavender to me, of course I&#x27;m new to burning incenses...I thought it would smell like reg lavender does in air freshers and candles..</li>
    <li> Totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> I am not a major fan of HEM. This has such a wonderful, relaxing scent. Not cheap! I actually don&#x27;t burn them all. I stick them in my houseplants all around and the wonderful scent wafts as I walk by.</li>
    <li> it accually has a lavander smell i have been trying to find a good lavander incense and none had the accual smell of lavander this one does</li>
    <li> I forgot to review this product but better late than never.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the incense sticks - the odor is wonderful and they burn fairly clean.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a box and so I expect they will last a long time. I do not burn every day but at least a few times per week.  All in all, nice product.</li>
    <li> I have grown many types of Lavender for the last few years, from English to French because I like flowers that have a  scent or what&#x27;s  the use? Anywho, this is the most legit scent I&#x27;ve ever found and people who think it isn&#x27;t have had their noses damaged by the gladey fake stuff. Lavender is easy to grow, preference is only full sun everything else is negotiable for this hardy plant, and yes, harvesting for dried bouquets which retain their scent is possible. Be prepared to fight the bees off for them!</li>
    <li> While the incense burns well, the lavender scent is too sweet -- so much so that it&#x27;s almost bitter!  Sounds paradoxical but that&#x27;s its effect.  Lavender is known to be calming and relaxing, this version makes me want to leave the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;The box of incense contains 6 \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; of 20 incense sticks each.  My previous comments pertained to the first tube.  I decided to try another tube and the scent was milder (and I no longer wanted to leave the room;-)  I&#x27;ve been using them since and have added another star, but will still try a different scent next time.</li>
    <li> Great price for something I love...so worth it. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the relaxing smell of these Lavender incense - great buy.</li>
    <li> Yesterday evening we lit 2 sticks. We have an 1800sq ft home and you could smell the lavender all the way in the basement. It was great. The best part i woke up this morning and went upstairs and you could still smell the lavender!</li>
    <li> smell is not very good. It is also very strong. Would not recommend this product to someone else. . .</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says it is. This is the standard smell that one would experience walking into a shop with incense. Good price for the number of sticks.</li>
    <li> I used them in the bathroom, in the rest of the house whenever I need a cleansing and calming scent.  Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the incense. It smells great and burns slow. It does burn dark so don&#x27;t light it next to light walls or curtains</li>
    <li> my only complaint is the incense sticks weren’t all uniform thickness so it is harder to get them to fit in my incense holder</li>
    <li> This was just as good and better than other one. Burn time is from 30 to 45 minutes exceptional</li>
    <li> I used to have to visit the local new age store to purchase these wonderful smelling incense sticks.  I love the fragrance and the quality of the burn to the stick.  For the same price of buying one of the little boxes, I was able to purchase three times the amount!  I will definitely be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> It does give the house a nice, fresh powdery scent.  Stick to oils if you want a more potent lavender smell.</li>
    <li> Smells great..highly scented. This is my.fave scent yet!</li>
    <li> The lavender smell is really soothing.  It is easy to light up and one will last 20 minutes.  Good incense quality.</li>
    <li> Really great product! The box contains a large quantity of high quality incense. The smell is really light and clean. I was nervous buying it without trying it first, but it has been such a delight! We will definitely buy this wonderful item again. Plus, it is such a better price than if you buy it from a store.</li>
    <li> Love the Lavender smell. Real nice</li>
    <li> Potent but they do burn quickly.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a bit of a &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; lavender scent and I found it!  Not too sweet.  As soon as this arrived I was hooked.  My new favorite!  I burn this to relax and at bedtime.  Nice strong smell fills the entire upstairs.</li>
    <li> Not bad. Good scent throw and great price. Just a little heavy on the thickness of the smoke. Still not bad.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance of this precious lavender sticks.  I&#x27;ve put some in the linen closets.  Oh, I love this.  Prompt shipping.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Strong as all heck, but very nice.</li>
    <li> Love them!  Very nice scent</li>
    <li> I have a favorite and this is it</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender to me</li>
    <li> The scent is moderately strong and will fill a room nicely. So A+ for effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents are very long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a lavender incense, but for a cheap price, these are those. I like em &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Great incense. I can&#x27;t find lavender easily here local, this was a great find. Will order more when I run out.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is very soothing and relaxing. Sticks burn slowly, and scent is pleasantly fresh. I will purchase more in the future. Best incense that I&#x27;ve used in years.</li>
    <li> lavender helps me sleep at night and I&#x27;ve been knocked out before half is even burned. Such a nice relaxing aroma.</li>
    <li> man! can smell this outside the bag, its really strong, i&#x27;ve never smelt lavender (as far as i knew at least) before i got this, its got a strong scent, it smells kinda good, i&#x27;m sure someone who thoroughly enjoys that smell would enjoy it much more. the shipping was ok, but the box was a bit wet, but the incense was in plastic and packaged very well, so no problem there at all.</li>
    <li> My first review was a one star because the smell was awful. For whatever reason, after burning it twice, I decided to give it another try. Wow! So glad I did. All I can say is there must have been a few bad sticks because the aroma is so pleasant! I am delighted that I gave it another try. I only gave 4 stars because it does not smell like lavender to me , but it is pleasantly soft, not over powerful and lasts a good while. I really do love this fragrance! Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Lavender Incense is my favorite!. Great price and it smells nice. What a deal. I Highly Recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Been trying quite a few different types of incense and this one hits the mark. A gentle soothing smell in my opinion and its close to lavender</li>
    <li> Expected the incense to smell like Lavendar.  Instead it smells like smoking wood.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with 120 sticks.  Thanks</li>
    <li> The incense are very strong, but once you light them they don&#x27;t give off the smell of lavender. Smells like regular incense- sort of woodsy.  There are tons of them in the box though.  I gave them to my yoga studio.</li>
    <li> Purchased &amp;#34;Precious Lavender&amp;#34; in the past because I like the smell, it burns slowley and as in the past the rich smell is good for me. I would recommend this product to anyone who cares for the smell of Lavendar</li>
    <li> DELIGHTFUL SCENT. LONG LASTING. BURNS SLOW AND EVEN. ONCE OPENED, I RETAIN THE INNER WRAP OF EACH NEXT TUBE OF STICKS, TO ENSURE LONG-LASTING SCENT, THEN I STORE THEM VERTICALLY WITH WOODEN ENDS UP. MIGHT BE MY IMAGINATION, BUT, THE LAST ONE SMELLS LIKE THE FIRST ONE BURNED.  TRY THIS IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH SCENTS &#x27;LASTING&#x27;... MY FAVORITES ARE THIS, LAVENDER, AND LILAC. I WAS BURNING BLOOD DRAGON, BUT THESE ARE NOT SO HEAVY. I HAVE SEEN MY LAST BLOOD DRAGON, IN FAVOR OF THIS AND THE LILAC. THANKS FOR THE FORUM.... HEM RULES!</li>
    <li> Just wish the scent of lavender was a bit stronger.  I found myself burning 2 sticks at once to get the level of scent I wanted.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Lovely fragrance and almost no smokiness.</li>
    <li> The scent is a soothing one. I enjoy the smell.</li>
    <li> great smelling incense! so much in the boxes i dont think ill need to buy incense for a while. worth it</li>
    <li> At first, I thought I was insane to order 120 incense sticks, however, I burn 3-6 a day.  I, also, gave one of the boxes to my yoga teacher, who absolutely loved it and gave the gift bag a wonderful aroma.  Another GREAT concept is the way it is packaged.&lt;br /&gt;There are 6 individual boxes each containing 20 sticks making it perfect to stuff into a gift bag. If you are into incense, this&lt;br /&gt;product will not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Absolutely does not smell like lavender.  Just smells like incense, which is exactly what I did not want.</li>
    <li> This Lavender incense smells like Lavender...REALLY!  A soft pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I use incense alot and like most of the HEM scents but this one is a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;m getting another box.</li>
    <li> IF YOU LOVE LAVENDER,  YOU WILL LOVE THESE. I OPENED ON BOX &amp; PUT IT WITH MY OTHER INCENSE &amp; I COULD STILL SMELL THEM WITHOUT BEING LIT</li>
    <li> Very nice. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance but it doesn&#x27;t last long.  Some incense will smell for hours after the stick has burned out, but not this one.  I have to continuously light a new one to keep the scent in the air.</li>
    <li> Most incense smell the same if they&#x27;re cheap or are too harsh but these are perfect.~ On another note if you used them modestly they last quite some time, i use them here and there and i still have a few boxes left. Had for about 8 months or more. Great buy/ Recommend 5/5</li>
    <li> Amazing aroma.  Feelings of warmth, peace, and joy. Great for meditation, yoga, relaxation. Quiet hints of lavender.  I love to light 3-4 for more mediation power.</li>
    <li> Found these to burn faster than regular incense but has great scent. However, it doesn&#x27;t last long tho.but somewhat soothing.</li>
    <li> Fantastic - Love the tubes - great for gifts!  Aroma is very pleasant and fills the room very nicely.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> After trying a few different brands of incense, I have come to the conclusion that Hem is definitely the best.  The incense burns well and has a deep, rich fragrance.  Some of the incense I have purchased had some flaws like 1) staying lit  2) fragrance quality, or 3) incense powder falling off the stick.  None of these are issues with Hem.  I&#x27;m going to stick with this brand.  Oh, and by the way, the Lavender scent is wonderful.</li>
    <li> We burn insense regularly. Was happy with this purchase, especially the price.  Plan the buy again in the future. Good buy</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quality of this incense. I put a stick in my car and didn&#x27;t even need to light it and the car smells great. It burns clean and the smoke smells wonderful too. I didn&#x27;t realize how many were in the order. This is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Box was a little crushed, but burns and smells GREAT !!</li>
    <li> This smelled horrible. returned as soon as it got to my house. Smells like dirty old men.</li>
    <li> These stick seem to burn longer and have a longer lasting scent then many I have tried. I will be ordering this product again and I have no problem recommending it to others.</li>
    <li> As an avid incense user, this has to be one of the best brands and quality of incense I have ever used.  The sticks are double wrapped in the box for extra freshness and quality. Some sticks are thicker than others, but nonetheless, top quality.  The scent is quite nice as it smells exactly as it advertises.  The lavender is a nice unisex scent as I was worried that the scent may be too feminine, but it has been a nice balance. I would highly recommend this scent and brand to anyone!</li>
    <li> If you like incense these are great. One stick burns 30 minutes. I like the lavender smell, very relaxing. My be strong for some but it covers up the smell of my herb, so it works for me.</li>
    <li> Nice!  Burns well and smells good.  Great price.</li>
    <li> This is a surprising amount of decent incense. Good smell that doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; like many other incenses do.</li>
    <li> Very good smelll, long life in burning, great!!!</li>
    <li> this incense smells amazing.  it doesn&#x27;t have that overpowering lavender smell alot of lavender incense has.  it smells real and not fake.  leaves a wonderful scent hours after burning it, even with windows open.  i was reluctant to buy it, but it got lots of good reviews from people who said it wasn&#x27;t a strong scent.  really glad i tried it.</li>
    <li> Lavender invaded my house with great lasting scent.</li>
    <li> very good amount of scent-burns well</li>
    <li> The scent may not be for all, but I love it. Smells and burns very clean, and one stick goes for about 45 min -- not bad.  Not sure I&#x27;d say lavender is the primary scent, but it&#x27;s there along with a very slight perfume and something fruity.  It kind of reminds me of an ethnic grandmothers house, in my case, Greek, and I mean that in a good way.  It&#x27;s a very unique scent that I definitely like.  The scent also lingers long after a stick is done burning.  Excellent incense, especially at 120 sticks for $5.</li>
    <li> The quality of these incense sticks is good. . . I like lavender a lot, just don&#x27;t like the incense lavender - or at least not this one. It reminded me of an old lady&#x27;s house. I gave away a few boxes and threw the rest in the trash.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brand and this scent, it instantly relaxes me, has great quality, burns steady, not too quick, fills the room with a calm, soothing scent.</li>
    <li> Ok this stuff is not the most pleasant smell but light 2 up and fire up a cig of whatever u like (haven&#x27;t tried tobacco because can&#x27;t have that smell ) but other smells I know for sure just straight eliminates. So buy this and a &amp;#34;Very Very Rich Vanilla incense and burn that same time</li>
    <li> The smell of incense is great in any home its fast....very relaxin smell</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t own up to the reviews, a big disappointment. Will never buy this again . . .</li>
    <li> Good product though I prefer frankincense/myrrh; serves the purpose of making a cozy, clean and calm environment. A good partner for studying and reading.</li>
    <li> Has a very nice scent to it, not really overbearing as some tend to be.  Overall, I&#x27;d say a nice incense.</li>
    <li> Half the sticks are not complete and they don&#x27;t stay lit</li>
    <li> this is really the best incense  even  being usure of the scents,they all smell great  fast delivery great price even better quantity  very happy</li>
    <li> This brand--and this particular seller--have extremely high quality incense for the price. I bought this item on sale for 240 sticks for $12. The incense was wet when I received it and continues to smell wonderful with each light. Ever stick stays lit - never goes out. They burn for a while and have a lot of smell to them. The smell is wonderful as well. All in all - - have purchased this product twice and loved it both times. Would continue to do so when I need more.</li>
    <li> These arrived today as I was on my way out to run errands, so brought the box in the car with me.  I could smell the wonderful lavender scent through the shipping box - it was fantastic!  When I picked up my kids from school, they both commented that &amp;#34;It smells really good in here --- what is it?&amp;#34;  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and burn a stick or two.  Which is exactly what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good quality sticks.  The aroma is fantastic, they burn very clean and I got about 40 minutes burn time.  Nice packaging, too - I like the slim individual boxes, so I can keep out one box and keep the rest in a ziploc to preserve the scent.  Except I did toss one box under the seat in my car!  2 boys who are active in sports bring there own &#x27;incense&#x27;, so this will be a nice change!</li>
    <li> Smells terrific. Scent fills a large space easily. Very pleased. (Ten more words required? Really. I can space some digital ink. Here you go then.)</li>
    <li> I am new to incense so my aroma skills are not as seasoned as the other reviewers on Amazon. But bottom line I had guest over and everyone thought it stinked.  And I thought lavender was supposed to smell nice.  It smells like sweet smelling musk and the sad part is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long. Which in my case was a good thing in regards to my guest. I sent it back.  Wouldnt recommend it for someone that wants a nice sweet smell in there house.  But I would say buy it, burn a few sticks and see if you like it.  You can return it like i did and get the refund.</li>
    <li> Awesome lavender scent!  I was never much into incense until a friend convinced me to try these.  Now I find myself burning incense more and more love this strong lavender scent... very relaxing!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  They burn VERY quickly and not a quality scent.</li>
    <li> Like the use of incense and this works well and stays lit.  Would recommend to anyone.  I also ordered other scents and they are all great.</li>
    <li> The scent is absolutely heavenly and perfumes the air wonderfully.  I&#x27;m going to try other HEM incense.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like incense!</li>
    <li> This is great smelling incense at a great price, that really smells like lavender. I have used HEM products before and have been consistently happy with their incense sticks. My only slight complaint is that I wish their sticks burned longer. They do burn up rather quickly, especially when compared with other incense sticks from India (Satya, for example). However, the great price helps to offset this issue, somewhat. I highly recommend that people who like lavender try this incense.</li>
    <li> The scent of the precious lavender sticks if just wonderful!  When I burn the sticks, it leaves a lovely scent... I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> These smell stronger and burn cleaner than the same exact product I bought from the local store.  These are good incense.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Lovely lavender smell throughout the house using just one of these. Calming effect is  great.</li>
    <li> The scent is nice.  They burn for about 30 mins. they&#x27;re not overly smoky.  The scent last awhile so you don&#x27;t have to burn a ton of them.  The smell is pleasant.</li>
    <li> long lasting, wonderful fragrance to use. very calming effect. this is the perfect lavender incense. i&#x27;m so glad i found these.</li>
    <li> The scent on these is terrific they don&#x27;t seem to burn the whole way down but maybe I am just having issues. I loved the product strong scent filled a large room</li>
    <li> Fabulous and wonderful scent</li>
    <li> Product has a nice smell.  Disappointed with how thin and unevenly coated each stick was.</li>
    <li> it was everything you promised.  couldn&#x27;t ask for more</li>
    <li> This incense has a strong lavender aroma and makes me feel good. I have to be careful about how I scent my surroundings because I get headaches from a lot of synthetic smells - since this is so pleasant I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a natural lavender (as opposed to chemicals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It burns easily and well.&lt;br /&gt;It is packaged in very pretty boxes - each group of 20 has its own hexagonal box.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m storing the separate little boxes in various drawers because it is strong enough to double as a lavender \\&quot;sachet\\&quot; - I love catching a whiff as I go through the day even when I&#x27;m not actively burning a stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I want to give a balanced review but I really can&#x27;t think of a con. I wish the separate boxes had a tab to re-close them but that&#x27;s not really a true con.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell through-out the home.  Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I Love the smell of the lavender scent! I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Great smell. Burns long. Would recommend and buy again when i run out</li>
    <li> Smells great. Well packaged. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Good quality, reasonable price &amp; fast shipping. No complaints!</li>
    <li> Works good and as advertised</li>
    <li> I like the lavender scent a lot, but these incense sticks won&#x27;t burn properly. They seem to burn for about 5 minutes before going out. I find myself re-lighting the same stick about 3 or 4 times. Kind of irritating, but they give off a lot of scent when they do burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 6-8-13: After using these a little more, I think the first few may have burned inconsistently, but all the ones I&#x27;ve burned since posting the original review have burned fine. Not sure if the problem was me or the incense, but no problems now. Very happy with these.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like I thought it would. Just ok.</li>
