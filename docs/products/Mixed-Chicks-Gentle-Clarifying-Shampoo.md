      <li>Well i do say the shampoo worked better than the leave in conditioner</li>
      <li>I think that the products are just meant to be used together, and I just don&#x27;t notice how wonderful my hair feels until the deep conditioner.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;they are not being 100% truthful about their formulas&#x27; benefits.</li>
      <li>Many products either bothered my scalp or it ruined my hair.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I will not change my star rating because it is still one of the best non-CG products I&#x27;ve used, and it totally changed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>My hair has never felt so soft and healthy, and people keep complimenting me on how great my hair looks.  </li>
      <li>Must have some strong chemicals in there.</li>
      <li>The shampoo works good, makes my hair feel clean but not stripped, but it doesn&#x27;t really lather.  </li>
      <li>But the leave in conditioner is chemical free and thus will use continue to use that for now.</li>
      <li>This is yet another great product from Mixed Chicks.  </li>
      <li>Very much enjoy the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Considering trying the sulfate free version or the children&#x27;s version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mixed chicks is perfect, it really seems to be made just for her hair.</li>
      <li>I first purchased at Target and thought it was pricey, however, your price is even better.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo smells great and it gently washes and moisturizes without stripping the natural oils from my hair which keep frizz at bay.  </li>
      <li>For me this shampoo gets my hair really clean after a week</li>
      <li>It clean your scalp and get rid of build up dirt.</li>
      <li>While it does a great job cleaning my hair, it leaves my hair feeling dry and matted.</li>
      <li>Their conditioner on the other hand worked really good :)</li>
      <li>Nothing special.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s perfect and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and leaves it very soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>, it leaves her hair nice and soft</li>
      <li>it is full of chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>People with curly hair will really benefit the most from this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I liked how it made my hair still stay curly and &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; but soft.  </li>
      <li>her curls really do look and feels healthy.</li>
      <li>The Mixed Chicks hair care products are simply the best...</li>

      <li>I love that my curls move naturally when the wind blows ...</li>
      <li>Really not that big of a deal since this is when it looks its best anyway...</li>

      <li>Mixed Chicks offers me a shampoo that is not drying but still gives me that great curl definition.  </li>
      <li>I loved the deep conditioner in this product line so much I decided to try the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product is as described.  The best product we have used for course ethnic hair.  We would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> For years I have struggled with my hair.  I have naturally wavy/curly hair.  It is blonde so the hair itself is thin, but I have a LOT of it.  I have a tender head so not having tangles is a really big concern, but I also have terrible allergies.  Many products either bothered my scalp or it ruined my hair.  This product is the best!  After the first few times of using this product, my hair was amazing.  At this point, I only use the shampoo!  I have never in my life been able to wash my hair and not use a conditioner.  I do use a little detangler to pick out my hair, but other than that I rarely use a conditioner!!  This product is wonderful.  I have never been happier with my hair in general.  Now I have to find someone to give all my other products.  Try this, you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> We use this and the leave in conditioner on our kids hair. Particularly gentle and smells great. We use as much as four or five times a week during the summer after they&#x27;ve been swimming.</li>
    <li> I have 2 girls ages 7 &amp; 9 who are bi-racial black/white. They both have naturally curly hair...I really love the mixed chicks leave in conditioner for them. Works absolutely great. However, I will not use the shampoo or regular conditioner because of the harsh chemicals in it. You can read a list of ingrediants on drugstore dot com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly wish there was a product that was chemical free for ladies with natural curls..I will keep researching myself. But the leave in conditioner is chemical free and thus will use continue to use that for now.</li>
    <li> I always wore my hair flat-ironed because I could never find any products for this thick curly (3c) hair of mines lol.but recently I just started wearing it natural and im loving it! I would recommend to anybody with any type of curly hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo wasn&#x27;t bad, but it wasn&#x27;t great either. Their conditioner on the other hand worked really good :)</li>
    <li> it is full of chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;those natural ingredients don&#x27;t help because they are being stripped out of the hair simultaneously by the sulfate(s) in this shampoo formula!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the conditioner even though it is not totally natural. I just like the scent and how it detangles my hair in the shower with my shower comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, I have totally turned my business to [...] because Mixed Chicks, as well as several other \\&quot;ethnic friendly\\&quot; products, claims to use hydrating botanicals when really it is just giving us poisoned food for our hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are not being 100% truthful about their formulas&#x27; benefits. If you&#x27;re going to provide natural ingredients, make them ALL natural. Don&#x27;t include toxic chemicals that strip my curls of what they need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Mixed Chicks changes its formula then fine.  Until then, I&#x27;m sticking with the one company I know won&#x27;t compromise my hair&#x27;s health, and that&#x27;s Brendita&#x27;s Body Works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s Cre0le with a zero, not an O.</li>
    <li> this product is expensive and has very bad ingredients. i am half black and half white with 3c hair. its very drying and takes the moisture out of my hair.i rather try a no sulfate or paraben zone such as traders joes curls jealous. its not what i expected. to each its own i will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I love mixed chicks products and ordered this by accident as we normally use the leave in conditioner which is amazing. But The shampoo I found to be very drying for my daughters VERY curly hair. But with the leave conditioner as well it seems to work.</li>
    <li> Well i do say the shampoo worked better than the leave in conditioner but i still have frizz. I had to buy each product separately because the shampoo where i&#x27;m at cost $16, the leave in conditioner $22 &amp; the deep conditioner $25. Maybe that&#x27;s why it isn&#x27;t working for me i probably need all steps. So this whole day i gotta figure out what the heck i&#x27;m gonna do with my hair. I wish i could post a pic but my hair looks so bad that i&#x27;m thinking about wearing a wig or a giant hat. It looks absolutely terrible. Does anybody know any products that are much cheaper but actually work?... because i&#x27;m having a bad hair week not just day, lol.</li>
    <li> I am East Indian and Black (Caribbean) mixture. Stopped relaxing my hair 2 years ago. After following up every recommendation and spending tons of money I tried this line of products with the usual skepticism. OMG.....I have been liberated. Shampoo, leave in conditioner and the serum are absolutely amazing! My curls look the way I have always wanted them to and my highlights are now awesome. Strangers compliment me on the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixed up hair is different and very individual and it may not work for everyone but MY search is over!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is yet another great product from Mixed Chicks.  I bought all three of their products and I&#x27;ve been using them together for several months.  My hair has never felt so soft and healthy, and people keep complimenting me on how great my hair looks.  It even smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m half black/half white (3C hair), so finding hair products has been such a pain for me!  It&#x27;s either specifically for white hair, or specifically for black hair.  I think that many mixed people will find that mixed hair is not one or the other, but both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product for any biracial person, but I think that all people with curly hair will love this.  Out of the three products from Mixed Chicks, I like the shampoo the least, but it still beats every other shampoo that I&#x27;ve used.  I think that the products are just meant to be used together, and I just don&#x27;t notice how wonderful my hair feels until the deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re like me and are looking for a hair product that will bring out the best of your curls, Mixed Chicks really does offer great products.  These aren&#x27;t miracle cures, so don&#x27;t expect extremely damaged hair to be perfect overnight, but after repeated use, I think that anyone will notice a great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;About 9 months ago I quit using Mixed Chicks products because I decided to try the Curly Girl method, which involves eliminating certain ingredients that this contains.  I will not change my star rating because it is still one of the best non-CG products I&#x27;ve used, and it totally changed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I would like to mention that after hanging around the naturallycurly.com message boards, I have found that you either love this product or hate it.  I am saddened that several people have tried this with poor results, and it just goes to show that people with similar looking hair can still require different types of products for their hair.  If that is you, I&#x27;ve heard good things about Blended Beauty products, so maybe that is the product for you.  You also might want to consider the Curly Girl/Guy (CG) method as explained on the NC message boards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to post this update on my reviews of Mixed Chick&#x27;s products as well.so maybe that is the product for you.  You also might want to consider the Curly Girl/Guy (CG) method as explained on the NC message boards.      I am going to post this update on my reviews of Mixed Chick&#x27;s products as well.</li>
    <li> II&#x27;m Mexican and Puerto Rican .... I&#x27;ve tried many hair products that left my hair dry, frizzy, stiffed and didn&#x27;t give the loose natural looking curls ... I&#x27;m so happy with this product!!!  I love that my curls move naturally when the wind blows ... Wooooo Hooooo No more sticky and stiffly locks!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, leave-in conditioner that gave me soft looking, full curls. No goo, no stiffness, no clumping. I am Caucasian, with \\&quot;older woman\\&quot; curly, fine hair, often frizzy.  The frizz-ease products have left an oily feel that weighed my hair down.  Mixed Chicks conditioner gave me full-looking, soft, non-frizzy hair.  You may have to experiment with the proper amount - I don&#x27;t need a lot.  But I can throw away my closet-full of other products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, its like magic to my ears. I have realy curly hair its like 4a in the back and 3c in the front and my hair looks so cute. I will definitely be buying some more</li>
    <li> Mixed chicks is amazing. i used to always straighten my hair because i could not find any products that could tame my naturally curly biracial hair. i came across the mixed chicks website and have been wearing my hair curly ever since. I use the shampoo, deep conditioner, and leave in condition..which is my favorite. They have a great smell, and make my curls looks amazing all day without the frizz. i dont know how i lived without this! Anyone with curly, or biracial hair needs to try this...you wont be dissapointed!! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> My stylist used mixed chicks products on my hair one day. They are amazing products. They take so-so unattractive wave/curls and turn them into something amazing.Highly recommended you give them a try!</li>
    <li> I bought these products for my daughter who is a mixed child and it has actually made her hair more coarse. The website gives false advertising. The product, more the leave in conditioner leaves white flakes in her hair. I bought all 3 products and I&#x27;m sad to say I wasn&#x27;t satisfied in the least.</li>
    <li> The Mixed Chicks hair care products are simply the best...nothing else has come close.  I am 48 years old, 50% gray (use to have blue black hair), and caucasian (as far as I know).  The \\&quot;white\\&quot; person curly hair products left my hair brittle dry and \\&quot;black\\&quot; person hair products left it too oily.  I now use the entire line of Mixed Chick hair care products, exclusively.  Please note, to date, I have personally tried 27 different brands from expensive salon to bargain brands (over two years).  Only Mixed Chick products gave me daily hair success, summer, winter, every time.</li>
    <li> I heard of this product from some biracial friends of mine. I am Caucasian and my hair is not curly, however it is very frizzy. So I thought I would just give it a try. I really liked it. It really helped smooth my air, and made it feel silky. I think I could have gotten similar results with Redkens \\&quot;all soft\\&quot; shampoo. However this one was very helpful for my unruly hair. People with curly hair will really benefit the most from this shampoo. I will continue to use this Mixed Chicks.</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars!  I am half Puerto Rican and half Lithuanian.  My curl is a 3b and I absolutely love this shampoo.  I have searched so long for hair products for my thick, 3b, corkscrew naturally curly and naturally dry hair.  This shampoo smells great and it gently washes and moisturizes without stripping the natural oils from my hair which keep frizz at bay.  I find this works best when you use the shampoo, the deep conditioner and the leave-in conditioner together.  Bravo Mixed Chicks!  You got it right.  I hope this stuff is around FOR-EVAH!</li>
    <li> My 2 year old daughter is biracial (half black, half white) and finding a shampoo and conditioner for her hair has been some serious work. She has soft, beautiful, curly hair that looks like it would be no problem to deal with. But the wrong products make it super dry and brittle to the point of breaking. Everything else we&#x27;ve tried is either for white people which is too drying - no good. Or it&#x27;s for black people which is too moisturizing and leaves her hair a bit greasy. Mixed chicks is perfect, it really seems to be made just for her hair. We are using this shampoo with the leave in conditioner and her hair is left in soft, luscious curls. It smells really nice too. I can&#x27;t imagine I will ever buy another shampoo and conditioner for her. This is truly the best.</li>
    <li> We were given a bottle of this after hurricane Sandy. I  was pleased because it was a brand we had wanted to try but didn&#x27;t care for the price. I have three daughters who are mixed white (Irish, German, French Canadian, English, Pollish, mostly just downright western American) and black Jamaican. Mixed feelings at first. I found it made the girls hair coarse and seemed to knot quicker. Then I changed my approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair gets brushed before washing. We use a small amount of this and pull it through head instead of rubbing it into scalp, this prevents knots. We use our regular conditioner as usual. The end result is a stronger definition and softer curl in the girls hear then with a different shampoo but same conditioner. Also. With four people using the shampoo it has lasted a year for this small bottle. Well worth the money. I am switching to a different shampoo for one or two of our three shampoos a week (that&#x27;s what works best with my girls hair), mostly for ease and because I consider this more a deep cleaner then a daily cleaner. Very much enjoy the shampoo. Considering trying the sulfate free version or the children&#x27;s version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did buy this when we ran out of what was given to us.</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed (half white, half black). She has loose curls on top &amp; tighter curls in back. When she was younger (around 3 years old) &amp; had much shorter hair this shampoo/leave-in conditioner was amazing. It worked so well. It was supposed to enhance her curls &amp; it did just that.&lt;br /&gt;However, the older she gets, the longer her hair gets &amp; it just doesn&#x27;t work very well anymore. It no longer enhances her curls &amp; it makes her hair very tangley &amp; hard to work with. It&#x27;s almost impossible to get it soft, no matter what kind of oil or conditioner I put in it.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that it&#x27;s better to just use Herbal Essence for curly hair &amp; a good finishing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, this is not a bad product. BUT in my experience it does not work for long hair. Shorter hair is best for this.</li>
    <li> So I have been searching for a great shampoo for my long, curly and tangled hair for forever now (I am 31 years old!).  So this is it.  It is great.  It&#x27;s a shame the leave-in conditioner doesn&#x27;t work as well as the shampoo and the deep conditioner</li>
    <li> I used to use this stuff when I had a digital perm.  I liked how it made my hair still stay curly and &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; but soft.  It still gave it that tight curl wet look.  I also use this on my daughter who is mixed with filipino, black and mexican.  She has hair like me but with a curly wave.  And I love how it holds her hair too and all day!  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years on her. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I received samples of the Mixed Chicks shampoo and deep conditioner, which I liked so much that I went and bought the liter sizes of the products. After some time of regular use, I have found this shampoo is extremely drying, and it doesn&#x27;t just feel that way, it really damaged my hair. Usually stylists compliment me on how nice my hair is, but after using this product for about a month, I was told my hair is damaged on the ends for the first time ever. I have straight white hair, so maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I am not \\&quot;mixed\\&quot; and my hair is not coarse and curly. I would not recommend purchasing this just because at first it seems good, but then your hair will get damaged from it in the long term. I&#x27;ve seen my reviews stating this and other customer&#x27;s reviews deleted off of a major retailer&#x27;s of this brand&#x27;s website, so I would be careful if you see all rave reviews for it. Definitely scroll through the reviews on here where people pick apart the ingredients as being damaging to hair, I wish I had seen it before I purchased.</li>
    <li> Works wonders, makes my hair very curly and I love it.  Get many compliments about my hair when I use it as I usually wear it up living in the Southwest. So on the times when I use this product I look good and it makes me feel good also.</li>
    <li> I loved the deep conditioner in this product line so much I decided to try the shampoo. This shampoo is gentle, but it leaves my hair a little bit more limp at the roots and frizzy on the ends than my standby shampoo (Bedhead moisture maniac).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad, and I will use it up, but it&#x27;s not the miracle the deep conditioner is.</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff.</li>
    <li> I am white but have very coarse, very curly hair.  I bought and used together the shampoo, deep conditioning, and leave in conditioner.  I LOVE the leave in conditioner.  I previously used alot of product in my hair to keep it together, and now I use just the leave in conditioner and it&#x27;s amazing.  The shampoo works good, makes my hair feel clean but not stripped, but it doesn&#x27;t really lather.  I like a good lather sometimes so would occasionally use my husband&#x27;s shampoo when I had that need.  The deep conditioner was also terrific, thick and creamy and only a small amount needed.  I am not sure I will purchase the shampoo again but the two conditioners are definite must haves for me.</li>
    <li> this product makes my hair feel gross, heavy, full of grit and i am upset i spent so much money on a problem that plagues me and yet now still have the same problem and a product that just takes up space on my shelf that was expensive</li>
    <li> I bought this product on my sister&#x27;s recommendation.  We both have what can only be described as Irish/Sicilian afros -- our hair has tight curl and gets very brittle.  When I used shampoo in the past, I thought that the drying effects of the shampoo helped my curl bounce into shape once it air dried.  Mixed Chicks offers me a shampoo that is not drying but still gives me that great curl definition.  This shampoo gives me the hair that I had always admired on other curly girls -- every curl is defined AND has movement.  I LOVE this formula.  My daughter also has unruly hair and Mixed Chicks shampoo and conditioner have helped make her morning dreadlocks a breeze to get through.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Love this wonderful hair product. It makes my hair feel shine and thick. It clean your scalp and get rid of build up dirt.</li>

    <li> I needed a new clarifying shampoo since my hair gets oily fast. While it does a great job cleaning my hair, it leaves my hair feeling dry and matted. I always follow up with a deep conditioner. I was kind of sad that it did not leave my hair soft like other people. And it smells like washing detergent. Must have some strong chemicals in there. I will use the rest of the bottle but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo I have been looking for the right shampoo for my Daughter&#x27;s and little sister&#x27;s hair type for a while now and I think I found it, it leaves her hair nice and soft no frizz or dryness her curls really do look and feels healthy. She has had many comments and compliments. now the best part Very little on your palm goes a long way on your hair. This is almost a concentrated texture shampoo, it rinses out all impurities in her hair. it&#x27;s hard to rate this product on its own because I&#x27;ve never used it alone in my daughter&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;ve always used the Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner with it. I would recommend always using the Deep. Conditioner when using this product because the shampoo cleans so thouroughly that you will need to condition it afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;  Cleans Thoroughly without drying her hair out&lt;br /&gt;  Great Smell&lt;br /&gt;  Lathers Well&lt;br /&gt;  Adds Shine&lt;br /&gt;  Adds Volume&lt;br /&gt;  Gentle&lt;br /&gt;  Improves Hair Health&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Uses&lt;br /&gt;  Curly Hair (natural)&lt;br /&gt;  Oily Hair&lt;br /&gt;  Thicker Hair&lt;br /&gt;  Thinner Hair&lt;br /&gt;  Dry scalp</li>
    <li> Smells great, detangles, promotes shine and leaves hair calm and healthy! I love the way it prepares hair for conditioner and does not leave it in shock.</li>
    <li> This really does work on all types of hair! I just used this leave-in condictioner and my hair looks like I got a perm without the frizz! I really recomend this product. I just wash use my leave in and let my hair dry natural and I use the Hair silk after and WALLA!!![[ASIN:B000G1MT2U Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner]][[ASIN:B001HK54D0 Mixed Chicks Hair Silk, 1.7 oz.]]</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo for any kind of hair. And it smells so good if you have lots of tangles in your hair this will get them out.</li>
    <li> Really love this shampoo.  Leaves hair very soft, curls look vibrant without frizz.  Highly recommend for anyone with naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect shampoo for my bi-racial daughter&#x27;s hair.  It is not too heavy and it lasts a long time.  She does not need to use a lot and she has long thick hair.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> My daughter is biracial and this is the one of the few products that works well on her hair.  Her hair looks healthy and feels great.  In combination with the Mixed Chicks deep conditioner it creates beautiful curls without the frizz.</li>
    <li> I first purchased at Target and thought it was pricey, however, your price is even better.  And I can now buy on line where as before Target was the only place I could find it.  It is really good stuff.  I love it.  And thank you for asking.</li>
    <li> Have used mixed chicks products now for three years.  When used along with both the  rinsed out and the leave in conditioner, makes for a healthy great looking head of hair that receives lots of compliments.  My mixed hair is African American, Indian and German.  The product really does what it says and the fact that all I have to do is wet my hair is an added plus.  Only down side for me is that because my hair is so thick, when the curl pattern is &amp;#34;locked&amp;#34;, I cannot get a comb through it without loosing a lot of hair unless I wet it again.  Really not that big of a deal since this is when it looks its best anyway...</li>
    <li> This is perfect for curly hair. I have soft ringlets that can get frizzy if too dry. This shampoo keeps my hair soft and tame without any weight. It also doesn&#x27;t strip away hair color.</li>
    <li> It is nice shamoo because it is very smooth;soft ; no tangle.it smell good.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo alot. How many times a week you wash your hair must be taken into consideration because if you wash your hair everyday with shampoo(which is terrible for your hair) then your hair will be dried further by shampoos with sulfate. As recommended by my hair dresser, I wash my hair once a week. For me this shampoo gets my hair really clean after a week so it&#x27;s perfect and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and leaves it very soft and manageable. Now it&#x27;s not five star because any little bit that gets in your eyes burns like hell(somehow it just manages to mix with the shower water and get into my eyes. This eye burning is worse than other shampoos I&#x27;ve used that have chemicals. I already have a staple shampoo but I found it after I had bought mixed chicks. Despite that this would still be my second choice in shampoos. I just wish it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes so much.</li>
    <li> I have mildly curly hair, which was losing some curl. I didn&#x27;t like this one. It seemed to weigh my hair down, dragging the curls with it.  I&#x27;m Caucasian, so don&#x27;t know if this was designed with gals like me in mind, but this isn&#x27;t for me. Definitely worth a try though.</li>
    <li> The best product for my granddaughters hair!</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  Like any other shampoo.</li>
