      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s true what others a re saying about the colors not blending vertically</li>

      <li>have fun with pretty nails!</li>
      <li>I wore them on the beach, in and out of the ocean, for 10 days and they looked freshly applied.</li>
      <li>They take a bit of time to apply (about an hour) but once they are on, I top them with a clear coat</li>

      <li>It just depends on how fast your nails grow.</li>
      <li>The product got here fast and on time.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t really see that rainbow effect from nail to nail.</li>
      <li>stretch these out before you apply, and that helps soo much, and you wont have chips or peeling if you do all this.</li>
      <li>i really like this pattern too</li>
      <li>I do use a clear coat on top for extra staying power.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>they aren&#x27;t to expensive, so at least give them I try, I love nails, makeup, hair products, ect, and buy way way way to much, so I do recommend this, which is a good thing!</li>
      <li>I really love these, I have many different styles, and you can get 2 uses out of every box, or at least I can, I do have short nails though, and</li>
      <li>use the buffer file to smooth down the edges at the end of the nail, and smooth out, and push down with the orange stick.</li>
      <li>Super easy to put on and last for at least 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care other than to give her props for this being really cutie on me.</li>
      <li>I can only see the top one in each package and they are one color with a small amount of color change along the edge, not the end.  </li>

<li> I use the remaining of one of the stips for the same nail on the same finger on the other hand, just put it on backwards, and it is the same thing, by backwards</li>
<li> I mean with the ripped end facing out, after ripping it off the first nail.</li>
<li> Avril is unbelievably ugly as a broken chipped reject mug, but these are beyond beautiful!!!</li>
<li> it takes me a little bit to file and shape my nails and cuticles, but as far as applying these stips it just takes about five mins tops.</li>
<li> a little more complicated, but can be done!</li>
<li> The only thing I was disappointed by was that you don&#x27;t know what colors there are until you open the individual package, AND OF COURSE, you can&#x27;t do that until you&#x27;re ready to use them or they harden up</li>
<li> dishes and other cleaning</li>
<li> I get 4 to five, but I&#x27;m very active and use my hands a lot.</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> it does not take but a few mins to apply these!</li>
<li> This is the first time I have been disappointed in a shade of the Sally Hansen Salon Effects.  </li>
<li> the longest I have worn them is 3 weeks and usually as an accent (one finger, just the tips, corners).</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why she chose boring skater little high schooler girl to endorse her products, a lot of them are the typical lame skulls and \\&quot;punk rock\\&quot; designs, it is an annoyance since it is a unneeded reminder of high school, which I&#x27;m so over already.  </li>
<li> Ugh she needs to move on with her stupid Hollywood life already, or go back to Canada!</li>
<li> they could have lasted longer, but the polish on the rest of my nails was wearing thin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not happy with this one.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been asked if I was wearing fake nails.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is 99% the ONLY brand I use for basic nail cover. You can get more time than they say even. It just depends on how fast your nails grow. I use a good base and then cover it with a nice top coat to get more out of the look. I bought several boxes of this. The only thing I was disappointed by was that you don&#x27;t know what colors there are until you open the individual package, AND OF COURSE, you can&#x27;t do that until you&#x27;re ready to use them or they harden up and then they&#x27;re garbage. Too many in the one box I&#x27;ve used so far were of the same color so I didn&#x27;t really see that rainbow effect from nail to nail.</li>
    <li> easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;withstands dishes and other cleaning&lt;br /&gt;lasts for weeks! the longest I have worn them is 3 weeks and usually as an accent (one finger, just the tips, corners). they could have lasted longer, but the polish on the rest of my nails was wearing thin. actually had difficulty with removal, but no damage to my natural nail which is a huge plus for me!</li>
    <li> This product looks very pretty. Yes, it&#x27;s true what others a re saying about the colors not blending vertically but I still think it looks great. If you choose the right colors for each nail it looks like they are blending into the next finger&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> The Sally Hansen Salon Effects nail stickers are FANTASTIC!!!  They last well over a week, are easy to apply, and come in so many cool designs!  I get complements on my nails all the time!!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect way to get cute nails when you don&#x27;t feel like or aren&#x27;t great at painting them. Super easy to put on and last for at least 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> The Sally Hansen polish strips are great. They take a bit of time to apply (about an hour) but once they are on, I top them with a clear coat and they last for two weeks. I wore them on the beach, in and out of the ocean, for 10 days and they looked freshly applied.</li>
    <li> i love the colors on this one. very bright and good detail. lasts about 2 weeks and love this better than nail polish.</li>
    <li> Thought this was a holographic design but it ended up a transition of rainbow colour. Was ok but not my favourite.</li>
    <li> i love these nail strips, they are easier than nail polish and last a while if you don&#x27;t have to do dishes too often :/ i really like this pattern too, it&#x27;s very cute, will buy again</li>
    <li> I love Sally Henson Salon Effects but this one was just a disaster. The colors were hideous and just looked tacky.</li>
    <li> peel off when you wash your hands</li>
    <li> this is just great!!!... i want to buy more of that. It stays long like 15 days and it remains flawless...</li>
    <li> I really love these, I have many different styles, and you can get 2 uses out of every box, or at least I can, I do have short nails though, and I use the remaining of one of the stips for the same nail on the same finger on the other hand, just put it on backwards, and it is the same thing, by backwards I mean with the ripped end facing out, after ripping it off the first nail. use the buffer file to smooth down the edges at the end of the nail, and smooth out, and push down with the orange stick. stretch these out before you apply, and that helps soo much, and you wont have chips or peeling if you do all this. it does not take but a few mins to apply these! it takes me a little bit to file and shape my nails and cuticles, but as far as applying these stips it just takes about five mins tops. I did try these out on my toes, and it worked! a little more complicated, but can be done! any questions about these just ask, I use them a lot, and LOVE them. don&#x27;t listen to all the neg reviews, but everything is not for everybody, so some people wont like stuff, ect, for me, I love these, and I think a lot of other people will as well, you just have to try them out! they aren&#x27;t to expensive, so at least give them I try, I love nails, makeup, hair products, ect, and buy way way way to much, so I do recommend this, which is a good thing! have fun with pretty nails!</li>
    <li> Avril is unbelievably ugly as a broken chipped reject mug, but these are beyond beautiful!!! Sally Hansen designs never seem to disappoint along with her whole beauty line which is amazing.  I don&#x27;t know why she chose boring skater little high schooler girl to endorse her products, a lot of them are the typical lame skulls and \\&quot;punk rock\\&quot; designs, it is an annoyance since it is a unneeded reminder of high school, which I&#x27;m so over already.  Ugh she needs to move on with her stupid Hollywood life already, or go back to Canada!</li>
    <li> Its a silver metallic background with colored metallic leopard.&lt;br /&gt;The color of the leopard spots are not multiple colors fading either.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and easy to apply (if this isn&#x27;t your first time). Love the colors and how the design is different from what you&#x27;d normally see. Had a metallic sheen so it made the design even more pretty. Love to use as an accent nail with bright summer colors. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about these press on nail polish tabs, but they work easily and look terrific.  I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> This one is not as pictured. Each finger will be a different color. It also felt thinner and bubbled up after one day. I&#x27;m not happy with this one. I&#x27;m happy that this was not my first time trying these. I would never purchase another one. The lust-rious is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Great price, good quality. Not for everyone. Takes practice to use and apply correctly, Designs awesome for someone who likes &amp;#34;art&amp;#34; on the nails without having to have major skills to accomplish the look. I&#x27;ve been asked if I was wearing fake nails. Nice to get salon quality results and since I change my look often, these are great for me.  Box states about 10 days wear- I get 4 to five, but I&#x27;m very active and use my hands a lot. Lasts better than polish on me and gives results I could never accomplish with polish alone. I do use a clear coat on top for extra staying power. Price better here than in stores if you are considering trying.</li>
    <li> When i received the stickers the rainbow effect goes from side to side instead of top to bottom so it wasnt what i was expecting. There still cute just not as cute as they should have been. I Also didnt know that each nail was a different color.</li>
    <li> Great, fast and perfect. They came as described. The product got here fast and on time. Everything went well. Cool.</li>
    <li> I love Salon Effects anyways...but this color rocks!  I guess it&#x27;s by \\&quot;Avril Lavine (sp??)\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t really care other than to give her props for this being really cutie on me.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have been disappointed in a shade of the Sally Hansen Salon Effects.  The picture shows multicolors.  I can only see the top one in each package and they are one color with a small amount of color change along the edge, not the end.  I won&#x27;t know until I open them if all are the same, but this one has no variation in color.  I even paid more for these than any others I have ordered because of the color shown.  Definitely will not order more of this shade. The color design on the side of the box shows the variation of color but the picture on the back of the box is one color.</li>
