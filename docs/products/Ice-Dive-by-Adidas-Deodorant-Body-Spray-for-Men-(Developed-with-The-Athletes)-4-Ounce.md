    <li> Very good. Thanks a lot. Regards</li>
    <li> Smells good. Long lasting without being over powering. Kind of a citrus smell.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant&lt;br /&gt;Great smell&lt;br /&gt; long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Overall great&lt;br /&gt;If u r looking for Adidas deoderant this is great much better than Axe&lt;br /&gt;Just very expensive</li>
    <li> I needed a body spray and did not want anything feminine or fussy.  This works.  Its cold and correct, spray works fine for me.  After the shower it completes me before the day&#x27;s challenges.</li>
    <li> Not to great smelling.</li>
    <li> Looks like the picture shows and smells really good not as strong as some mens body spray and that is a good thing</li>
    <li> Smells great! The container works i.e. I can actually spray without twisting and turning and hoping some spray would come out.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly on the costlier side but I think it&#x27;s a decent buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this just to spray when I&#x27;m leaving the gym after a hard workout so I don&#x27;t stink my car up.  Smells good and does the job.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is awesome. I got the package quickly and product was as expected. I will buy more in the near future.</li>
    <li> I love this deordorant. Very pleasant smelling body spray. Will purchase again soon. Once I run out.</li>
    <li> bought for my grandson and he&#x27;s very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> works good for the hard working man</li>
    <li> This has a very strong frangnance and lasts really longer. I prefer to use it when I expect a longer and tough day.</li>
    <li> Delivers on time, good product</li>

    <li> Axe is so much cheaper and smells better. Also, you only get like 5 sprays out of this thing. There is so much compressed air you literally don&#x27;t get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Been searching for a scent like Irish Spring Soap but until now no&lt;br /&gt;luck of finding one, anyway found this Ice Dive by Adidas not the&lt;br /&gt;one I look for but I like the scent is more aqua its more closed to&lt;br /&gt;the scent from Nautica Aqua/Blue perfume, for me I like it not so&lt;br /&gt;strong,smell fresh, I like also like the container with the rubber&lt;br /&gt;felt spray button is a plus, overall all recommend this product but&lt;br /&gt;not all like aqua, first try it in your local store to physically smell the scent.</li>
    <li> Got this and others for my son he loves them and the smell is not so overpowering they come in handy after gym.</li>
