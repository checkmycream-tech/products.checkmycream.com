### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Every color is amazing!!!</li>
      <li>The colors are truly great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really good to use.</li>
      <li>The product itself is really good.</li>
      <li>The colors are really amazing and very trendy colors in Korea.</li>
      <li>Excellent, very fast!</li>
      <li>This was a gift, but my friend mus have liked it, because three more friends asked me to order one for them.</li>
      <li>but it does leave a lovely tint.</li>
      <li>On the up-side, it shipped fast and arrived in great condition.</li>
      <li>this product is much better</li>
      <li>This lip product is okay</li>
      <li>The color is okay but is not as strong as some people say but the smell of it is overwhelming.</li>
      <li>, it is so light that you can see the color on your lip, even i put twice on, it does&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I really enjoy using them.</li>
      <li>The reason I was attracted to this product was because it was so unique.</li>
      <li>You kind of look ridiculous when you put the color on your lips but the color after that tint is beautiful.</li>
      <li>It looks like a deceiving amount of fun and the idea of having a lip color that won&#x27;t smudge and can last up to 12 hours IS too good to be true.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I don&#x27;t believe this material is authentic and the amount I paid for the set is not a small amount of money.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>I love putting these on as they last me a full day.</li>
      <li>the only thing good is the colors looks natural and it can be on your lips for a while.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my sister and I underestimated it at first.</li>
      <li>Glad to try different lip stikes</li>
      <li>The color is really pretty</li>
      <li>but I found that if I use a small amount on the middle of the top and bottom of my lips and spread it out it works best and for the inner portion of my lips, I smack my lips together</li>
      <li>I colors are really pretty.</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to repurchase from Wishtrend and this packet would be a better deal with different colors but found I was very unsatisfied with this set.</li>
      <li>you are looking for lipsticks which can stay a long time, better buy REVLON COLORSTAY LIQUID LIPSTICK</li>
      <li>ok, it just the waitting time is long, so</li>
      <li>dark colors can be like 5 hours, light ones are too light to see and disappear in 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;better</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping</li>
      <li>i really don&#x27;t like the peach one</li>
      <li>and it really works.</li>
      <li>and sometimes you can&#x27;t control how much you squeeze out of the tube.</li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t stay on for whole day.</li>
      <li>Just Ate A Whole Bag Of Cheese Puffs&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I like this product a lot more than lipsticks and glosses and other stains.</li>
      <li>came in a cute black box that said Berrisom and</li>
      <li>I love how it stays on for the whole day, the only thing i dislike about it is that you have to apply a lot to get a good color; if you only do one thin layer, the color doesn&#x27;t come out as well.</li>
      <li>kind of tricky and inner lips won&#x27;t let it dry completely</li>
      <li>; I keep my lips very hydrated, but this stuff will suck any moisture right out of your pout and make lips painfully dry.</li>
      <li>I really like the color of this lip tints but it doesn&#x27;t last for 12 hours.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty long lasting if you do not eat greasy food or apply too much lip balm before eating</li>
      <li>so it won&#x27;t completely come out when you peel it off.</li>
      <li>bronze - tan skin and my lip is darker not pink</li>
      <li>It stays for a long time only if you didn&#x27;t wash it very often or apply any cream or simply drink water regularly.</li>
      <li>And it is true that hard to apply on.&lt;br /&gt;if</li>
      <li>The colours are vivid and last longer tab expected.</li>

<li> The colours are vivid and last longer tab expected.</li>
<li> Otherwise, the color stays for longer than other lip stains I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
<li> I prefer the red colors to the pink colors, but even the pink colors look very natural.</li>
<li> They ca be a bit hard to apply the first time</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t really last a long time</li>
<li> u can not really reapply outside, i will suggest to take a tint lip balm for going out</li>
<li> I takes a long time like 15 mins before you can remove it</li>
<li> One application of these colors lasts all day long.</li>
<li> As long as yoh dont take a shower or scrub your lips, the color lasts really long.</li>
<li> When I did it this way instead of applying a whole mess to my lips, It dried faster and lasted a bit longer and was easier to peel off in one shot.</li>
<li> The lip stains are a little thick but we&#x27;ll worth the 10 min wait to dry.</li>
<li> Made my lips dry and crack.</li>
<li> too dry for the lips</li>
<li> It only last few hours (3-4 hours).</li>
<li> Only few of the colors worked for me.</li>
<li> I will give it to my sis because she is wait and her lips is pink .</li>
<li> show the color, other color works</li>
<li> This product does dry the lips a little bit, but I never ended up peeling off my skin or having my lips crack.</li>
<li> After leaving the tint on for the suggested 10-15 minutes, you peel off the dried goo (which will often tear pieces of lip skin, so be careful!)</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy this again, I find other lip tints easier to use.</li>
<li> The application process is really messy</li>
<li> and It doesn&#x27;t come off when you wipe it with tissue after you take the dried tint off.</li>
<li> It is very uneven unlike Wishtrend.</li>
<li> You have about 5 seconds to apply before it starts to congeal; it becomes a gluey, sticky mess.</li>
<li> it was hard to peel off and it also stains fingers when i were to peel it off</li>
<li> and I couldnt get the refund back even if my skin was hurting so bad.</li>
<li> I think it is not good for non-white color skin.</li>
<li> It is not good for me</li>
<li> Sadly it didn&#x27;t work on my lips .</li>
<li> Leaving the product on your lips for ten minutes is a difficult task when it tastes so awful.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very sad I was expecting alot.</li>
<li> Although I wasn&#x27;t expecting a high-quality cosmetic, this product was very disappointing.</li>
<li> I have always been a fan of lip color but hate having to reapply throughout the day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast Shipping and it really works.</li>
    <li> I colors are really pretty. I love how it stays on for the whole day, the only thing i dislike about it is that you have to apply a lot to get a good color; if you only do one thin layer, the color doesn&#x27;t come out as well.</li>
    <li> The reason I was attracted to this product was because it was so unique. The colors are really amazing and very trendy colors in Korea. As long as yoh dont take a shower or scrub your lips, the color lasts really long. It makes gradient lips easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came in a cute black box that said Berrisom and Oops My Lip Tint Pack on it.</li>
    <li> the only thing good is the colors looks natural and it can be on your lips for a while. dark colors can be like 5 hours, light ones are too light to see and disappear in 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;better put lotion before apply them on, and unless you want to remove your skin with the mask, dont buy them.&lt;br /&gt;whenever you open the product, it is not allowed to return. I use one of the sets and I couldnt get the refund back even if my skin was hurting so bad. And it is true that hard to apply on.&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for lipsticks which can stay a long time, better buy REVLON COLORSTAY LIQUID LIPSTICK, I brush my teeth and the lipstick color was still there. this product is much better then this Korean one.&lt;br /&gt;Never trust the Korean brand again.</li>
    <li> Only few of the colors worked for me. Made my lips dry and crack.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really last a long time but it does leave a lovely tint.</li>
    <li> This lip product is okay it&#x27;s pretty long lasting if you do not eat greasy food or apply too much lip balm before eating</li>
    <li> The application process is really messy and sometimes you can&#x27;t control how much you squeeze out of the tube. It doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of product so if you use it on a daily basis you will run out of it. The color is okay but is not as strong as some people say but the smell of it is overwhelming. I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy this again, I find other lip tints easier to use.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, but my friend mus have liked it, because three more friends asked me to order one for them.</li>
    <li> I was so exicted to try it. Sadly it didn&#x27;t work on my lips . I think it is not good for non-white color skin. I will give it to my sis because she is wait and her lips is pink . It is not good for me I am bronze - tan skin and my lip is darker not pink</li>
    <li> Excellent, very fast!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good to use. I takes a long time like 15 mins before you can remove it but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. The color stays on for the entire day even after you eat. You kind of look ridiculous when you put the color on your lips but the color after that tint is beautiful. Every color is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister and I underestimated it at first. Now, I use it on a daily basis. The colors are truly great. It stays for a long time only if you didn&#x27;t wash it very often or apply any cream or simply drink water regularly. It stays for maximum 30 min with me. But if I added it before sleeping the color stays till I wake up.  It also arrived 1 week earlier.</li>
    <li> I really like the color of this lip tints but it doesn&#x27;t last for 12 hours. It only last few hours (3-4 hours). The color is really pretty and It doesn&#x27;t come off when you wipe it with tissue after you take the dried tint off. But it doesn&#x27;t stay on for whole day.</li>
    <li> i really don&#x27;t like the peach one, it is so light that you can see the color on your lip, even i put twice on, it does&#x27;t show the color, other color works ok, it just the waitting time is long, so u can not really reapply outside, i will suggest to take a tint lip balm for going out</li>
    <li> it was hard to peel off and it also stains fingers when i were to peel it off</li>
    <li> Glad to try different lip stikes</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long. I used 14 times but every time they just work around 3-4 hours. I dont like them</li>
    <li> The lip stains are a little thick but we&#x27;ll worth the 10 min wait to dry. I love putting these on as they last me a full day. I even bought some for my mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this packet and bought just one &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; from Wishtrend and found a big difference. I was hoping they&#x27;d be the same so I wouldn&#x27;t have to repurchase from Wishtrend and this packet would be a better deal with different colors but found I was very unsatisfied with this set. It is very uneven unlike Wishtrend. Therefore, I don&#x27;t believe this material is authentic and the amount I paid for the set is not a small amount of money. I&#x27;m very sad I was expecting alot.</li>
    <li> The product itself is really good. The colours are vivid and last longer tab expected. The problem is the flavour. Leaving the product on your lips for ten minutes is a difficult task when it tastes so awful.</li>
    <li> Although I wasn&#x27;t expecting a high-quality cosmetic, this product was very disappointing. You have about 5 seconds to apply before it starts to congeal; it becomes a gluey, sticky mess. After leaving the tint on for the suggested 10-15 minutes, you peel off the dried goo (which will often tear pieces of lip skin, so be careful!) and are left looking like you just ate a popsicle. Because I purchased the pack as an experiment, I tried out every color and the only one that left a lasting color was the &amp;#34;Lovely Peach&amp;#34; -- the name of the color is misleading. It should be called &amp;#34;I Just Ate A Whole Bag Of Cheese Puffs&amp;#34; I keep my lips very hydrated, but this stuff will suck any moisture right out of your pout and make lips painfully dry. It looks like a deceiving amount of fun and the idea of having a lip color that won&#x27;t smudge and can last up to 12 hours IS too good to be true. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this to anyone unless you have the money to burn. On the up-side, it shipped fast and arrived in great condition. Can&#x27;t complain about the store/seller one bit.</li>
    <li> too dry for the lips and it actually split the day afterwards.</li>
    <li> Applying them evenly on your lips is kind of tricky and inner lips won&#x27;t let it dry completely so it won&#x27;t completely come out when you peel it off. Otherwise, the color stays for longer than other lip stains I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of lip color but hate having to reapply throughout the day. One application of these colors lasts all day long. I will def. be buying again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using them. I prefer the red colors to the pink colors, but even the pink colors look very natural. They ca be a bit hard to apply the first time but I found that if I use a small amount on the middle of the top and bottom of my lips and spread it out it works best and for the inner portion of my lips, I smack my lips together and I can coat the inside as well. When I did it this way instead of applying a whole mess to my lips, It dried faster and lasted a bit longer and was easier to peel off in one shot. I like this product a lot more than lipsticks and glosses and other stains. This, for me, lasted 8-10 hours and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off when I ate something or drank anything. This product does dry the lips a little bit, but I never ended up peeling off my skin or having my lips crack. After I take off the product from my lips I apply Burts Bees chap stick and go out the door. .</li>
