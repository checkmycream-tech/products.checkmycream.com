      <li>The shampoo is an excellent product and I can&#x27;t stand to use a different shampoo on my hair these days.  </li>
      <li>However because these misleading advertising issues are endemic in cosmetics anyway, and because the ingredients are significantly safer than in more mainstream conditioners, I give it four stars based on the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of NaturOli shampoo, so I thought I&#x27;d try the conditioner as well.</li>

      <li>Besides using NO chemicals in my hair, I love the way it makes my hair feel soft and smooth.</li>

      <li>I get many comments on my hair,  and I&#x27;m nearly 60 now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will continue to use even though price is steep,  as peace of mind about what&#x27;s being absorbed into my body is of importance to me.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the NaturOli Shampoo for dry hair now for several years and hoping that they would come out with an accompanying conditioner that&#x27;s free of all the harmful chemicals most conditioners these days contain.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going through it too fast for the price.</li>
      <li>but I was ready to ring my husbands neck for pumping the conditioner onto the shower floor until I realized it is drip drip dripping all on</li>
      <li>The conditioner is very oily but very watery.  </li>
      <li>I suspect that as a truly natural botanical soap, soapberry works better in shampoo than conditioner, hence the apparently only trace amount of it in this product</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is difficult to make a good hair conditioner without using a chemical quat because of their unique cationic properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a background in chemistry and it makes me laugh when other products claim to be free of this or that, yet they use a precursor or derivitave.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t appear to leave a build up on my hair as with many other conditioners.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo with get your hair squeeky clean and this product will put all the moisture back into your hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Although not the most gentle quat, it seems relatively harmless compared to its relative, benzalkonium chloride, which is often used in conditioners as well.</li>
      <li>More than half the bottle is gone.</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients, it&#x27;s one of the few products on the markets that doesn&#x27;t lie.  </li>

      <li>Really does not detangle my hair - also not soft.</li>
      <li>I really recommend the contidioner if you have even slightly dry hair.  </li>
      <li>; when it contains a chemical that it seems to me must be more than 0.1% (with the excuse that this chemical is found naturally in plants in small amounts), and to headline soapberry powder which seems to me to be only a trace ingredient.</li>
      <li>the soap nut powder is the last ingredient, after grapeseed extract (a natural preservative).</li>
      <li>My hair was extremely damaged from certain medications and health problems I have, but when I switched to NaturOil products my hair transformed before my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It contains sodium benzoate, a chemical preservative often found in soft drinks, that has a moderate hazard rating on the Skin Deep website.</li>

<li> What a waste.</li>
<li> Another example of a substance found naturally in small amounts in food that can be artificially produced in large, unsafe amounts is arsenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I just have trouble pressing purchase every time I remember how small it is for the price.</li>
<li> My hair seems a little shinier, lighter weight and softer!</li>
<li> What a waste!</li>
<li> but not sure I like how it feels in my hair.  </li>
<li> Not sure if there was a problem with my bottle</li>
<li> every time  I have to unscrew the whole thing and pour :(</li>
<li> Does this mean that it is extracted from plants, or that it is made by chemical processing of plant materials?  </li>
<li> Works like a dream very quickly, no more tangles!</li>
<li> Unfortunately I have to use a handful and that doesn&#x27;t even de-tangle my hair.</li>
<li> Very expensive for a conditioner that didn&#x27;t even work.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the ingredients, and the conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but when you want to avoid chemicals, it&#x27;s the norm.</li>
    <li> I found exactly what my hair needs. I use this with the NaturOli Soap Nut / Soapberry Shampoo 16oz Organic Natural Hair Care for my thick, course and usually frizzy unruly hair. NOT anymore :-)). I no longer need to continue searching to tame my mess. I don&#x27;t fuss with my hair, but I have tried a lot of products to tame the frizz, especially in the humid weather. I found my answer. Thank You</li>
    <li> This conditioner is not work for my hair. My hair is dry so it make again dry too.</li>
    <li> I use this with the NaturOli shampoo and they work well together. My hair seems a little shinier, lighter weight and softer! It doesn&#x27;t tangle as much throughout the day (it is long) and I&#x27;m not seeing as much hair in the brush! I will be a repeat customer. : )</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because I love the shampoo ( I am on my second bottle).  The conditioner is very oily but very watery.  Well I could live with that, the problem is after a month of using, I noticed black mold growing inside, I am not using it again, wish I did not buy it.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of NaturOli shampoo, so I thought I&#x27;d try the conditioner as well. It smells horrible--like Windex window cleaner. I wonder if the product has spoiled. I love the smell of the shampoo, but the smell of the conditioner has made it unusable in my book. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Very expensive for a conditioner that didn&#x27;t even work.  Natural products usually disappoint, but this barely passed as conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the NaturOli Shampoo for dry hair now for several years and hoping that they would come out with an accompanying conditioner that&#x27;s free of all the harmful chemicals most conditioners these days contain.  The shampoo is an excellent product and I can&#x27;t stand to use a different shampoo on my hair these days.  I get many comments on my hair,  and I&#x27;m nearly 60 now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this conditioner.  It does feel a bit different than most conditioners to me,...maybe  not as slippery and the tangles take a bit longer to disappear.  (I have long thick hair)  That&#x27;s ok with me just as long as there are no harmful chemicals.  The scent is not that noticeable which I prefer. (no heavy perfumes please)&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t appear to leave a build up on my hair as with many other conditioners.  Thumbs up on that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will complain about the price however.  It does seem you don&#x27;t get a very big bottle for what you pay for.  With the NaturOli shampoo one gets quite a substantial, larger bottle,  so I hope they will lower the price before too long if they can. A larger bottle for that price would be even better!&lt;br /&gt;- I will continue to use even though price is steep,  as peace of mind about what&#x27;s being absorbed into my body is of importance to me.</li>
    <li> This review is based solely on the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the company website: &amp;#34;100% Complete and Full Ingredient List:&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Aloe Vera Extract, Botanical Glycerin, Jojoba Oil, Organic Olive Oil, Behenalkonium Chloride (plant derived fatty acid), Hops Extract, Rice Bran Extract, Calendula Extract, Organic Rosemary Extract, Aspen Bark, Hydrolized Silk Protein, dl-Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Guar Gum, Sodium Benzoate (food grade preservative), Grapeseed Extract, Organic Soap Nut Powder&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the soap nut powder is the last ingredient, after grapeseed extract (a natural preservative). There must be only the tiniest amount. Yet it is promoted in the product&#x27;s title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The 5th ingredient, excluding water, is Behenalkonium Chloride, which is a quaternary ammonium salt (quat). It is a chemical, synonym BENZYLDOCOSYLDIMETHYL-CHLORIDE.  Quarternary ammonium salts are a common chemical used in many hair conditioners. Dove Hair Therapy Daily Moisture conditioner also uses Behenalkonium Chloride. According to the Skin Deep website it is not considered to be toxic to humans but potentially toxic to the environment, although related quaternary ammonium compounds are toxic to humans (see Wikipedia).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company website says this ingredient is plant derived. Does this mean that it is extracted from plants, or that it is made by chemical processing of plant materials?  It&#x27;s still a chemical made in a factory even if is chemically processed from botanical sources.  Some jet fuel is made from plant materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The justification for saying that Behenalkonium Chloride is a natural, non-chemical botanical may be that it is found in small amounts in plants. The same thing is true of trans-fats which are found in small amounts in natural animal products,  yet the trans-fats in our foods are chemically produced and a serious health risk.  The presence of a substance in small amounts in natural plants and animals does not mean that the substance is safe, especially when it is chemically produced and in much higher levels. Another example of a substance found naturally in small amounts in food that can be artificially produced in large, unsafe amounts is arsenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whole Foods Premium Body Care Standards does not allow Behenalkonium Chloride in products, although it does allow some gentler quats like guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride (WFM-Premium-Unacceptable-List-Dec5-2013_0.pdf).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to make a good hair conditioner without using a chemical quat because of their unique cationic properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not the most gentle quat, it seems relatively harmless compared to its relative, benzalkonium chloride, which is often used in conditioners as well. However it seems to me to be somewhat deceptive to advertise the product as &amp;#34;99.9 % botanical (contains silk), chemical-free conditioner.&amp;#34; when it contains a chemical that it seems to me must be more than 0.1% (with the excuse that this chemical is found naturally in plants in small amounts), and to headline soapberry powder which seems to me to be only a trace ingredient. (Their soapberry shampoo does contain Sapindus Mukorossi Aqueous Extract as its first ingredient.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It contains sodium benzoate, a chemical preservative often found in soft drinks, that has a moderate hazard rating on the Skin Deep website. A preservative is something that harms living cells- the bacteria and fungi that cause food spoilage. Many of us are looking to avoid artifical preservatives in our food, and some of us also in cosmetics we apply to our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a truly botanical, natural, soapberry conditioner but this doesn&#x27;t appear to be it. I suspect that as a truly natural botanical soap, soapberry works better in shampoo than conditioner, hence the apparently only trace amount of it in this product (perhaps so the product name can match the shampoo?). However because these misleading advertising issues are endemic in cosmetics anyway, and because the ingredients are significantly safer than in more mainstream conditioners, I give it four stars based on the ingredients. Not for those looking for the very safest, most natural cosmetic products that meet Whole Foods&#x27; premium body care standards or better, but more natural than most conditioners. (Dr. Bronners  IMO makes a more natural, safer hair conditioner.)cantly safer than in more mainstream conditioners, I give it four stars based on the ingredients.

    <li> My daughter introduced this brand of &amp;#34;soap nuts&amp;#34; hair care products. I absolutely LOVE everything this brand has to offer with soap nuts hair care. Besides using NO chemicals in my hair, I love the way it makes my hair feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This product  cleans my hair leaving it feeling like silk.</li>
    <li> I tried just the NaturOli shampoo by itself and found I need a light conditioner. This product worked perfectly. I bring my own hair products to my hairdresser. He likes these products too. My hair looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> Not sure if there was a problem with my bottle but I was ready to ring my husbands neck for pumping the conditioner onto the shower floor until I realized it is drip drip dripping all on it&#x27;s own.  More than half the bottle is gone. What a waste!</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and found the conditioner to be just as good. I only needed to use it every other shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good bc it doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals. I feel good about that. Unfortunately I have to use a handful and that doesn&#x27;t even de-tangle my hair. I&#x27;m going through it too fast for the price. I&#x27;ll look for alternatives.</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients, it&#x27;s one of the few products on the markets that doesn&#x27;t lie.  I have a background in chemistry and it makes me laugh when other products claim to be free of this or that, yet they use a precursor or derivitave.  The aloe IMHO is a great touch and I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t used more in natural products.  I just have trouble pressing purchase every time I remember how small it is for the price.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t make the pump work properly, so every time  I have to unscrew the whole thing and pour :( probably manufacturing problem.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t notice anything too exceptional about moisturizer, no difference whether I use it or not (except the obvious thing of making hair weigh down). Shampoo is really good though.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this conditioner (with the shampoo)  my hair is shinier and healthier than ever before.  My hair was extremely damaged from certain medications and health problems I have, but when I switched to NaturOil products my hair transformed before my eyes.  My hair looks great.  I really recommend the contidioner if you have even slightly dry hair.  The shampoo with get your hair squeeky clean and this product will put all the moisture back into your hair.  And it does it with any harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I like that there are no preservatives in it but not sure I like how it feels in my hair.  Only been using for awhile.</li>
    <li> Too oily left hair stringy looking</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t love it as much as shampoo.  Really does not detangle my hair - also not soft.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream very quickly, no more tangles!</li>
