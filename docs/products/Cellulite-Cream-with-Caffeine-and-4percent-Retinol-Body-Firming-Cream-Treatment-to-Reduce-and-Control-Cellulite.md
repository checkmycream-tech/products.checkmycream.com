<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little skeptical when it comes to creams and beauty product that make big claims. But I&#x27;ve got to say, this stuff is great! It&#x27;s not going to help you drop a few dress sizes or anything, but the dimples on my thighs are a lot less noticeable and the skin seems smoother and tighter, and more youthful. I&#x27;ll keep using it for sure - summer is right around the corner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, which I appreciate. I have chemical sensitivities and heavily fragrances products are a no-go for me, I&#x27;m very bothered by them. After I put this on I don&#x27;t notice a scent at all and it doesn&#x27;t react with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working. No smell. Recommend Use with exercise and healthy nutrition. Happy cudtomer</li>
    <li> I just started using this cream 4 days ago. I lobe how it hydrates my skin and I swear its smoothing out the ripples I have on my thighs. I wish I could press fast forward 30 days to see the results. Totally excited!</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this product. It applies smooth just like a lotion and absorbs quickly. I can really tell a difference in my thighs and my butt since I have been using it as they appear tighter and firmer than before. It does have a strong menthol smell to it but that is a small price to pay for the results that it gives. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I just started using this cream so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it&#x27;s untill I use it long enough. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like with the odor. I was hoping it would be a bit perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;Pleasantly surprised with this cream! First off I was happy with the free shipping and the fact that it arrived on time. The cream is odorless and non greasy. I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long but so far I can tell a difference as my skin is both softer and tighter than before. Very happy with my results!I would DEFINATELY recommend this cellulite cream</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks I haven&#x27;t noticed any crazy differences. But I have noticed a change in my thighs. The only thing about this cream is the smell, it&#x27;s terrible!  I put a scent lotion over this cream, and it does help!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream is very light and easy to blend into the skin, is not greasy and you can wash it off easily if you want to clean any excess residue.&lt;br /&gt;I hate cellulite and in a few days I have notice a big change, I already feel my skin tighter and it look much less clumpy, obviously it is not completely gone but al least I see results and that is what I like about this cream. It is a great product because due to its light weight you do not care about applying it every day  which is a annoyance with other creams</li>
    <li> Really like this product went on smooth witha cooling effect and slight menthol smell! My dimples on my theigh looked smoother and more even after 1 week! It has retinal which is good for your skin and caffeine which awakens and opens blood vessels! will be using in my daily routine!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best cellulite creams I&#x27;ve tried. It works wonders. Started seeing results pretty quickly. And the smell is nice. I would recommend this</li>
    <li> It does work well.. and I love how it moisturizes my skin. But I have to be honest. It has a very nasty smell to me. I don&#x27;t know if it is just my nose or what.  I am looking forward to seeing how well it works the longer I use it. I did recieve it as a sample to try, and give my honest opinion. I was not paid for this opinion.</li>
    <li> I am giving this to my mom as a Christmas present for her cellulite problems.</li>
    <li> It is truly amazing what 9 days can do. That&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ve been using this cellulite cream, 9 days. If you use the Caffeine Cream from Alluxe Naturals, in 9 days you can begin to feel a difference in the looks of your Cellulite. In 9 days, you can begin to see a slight tightening of your sagging skin. In 9 days, starting out with just a small amount of the cream, you can begin to feel the cellulite humps lessening. In 9 days you can begin to feel more confident in wearing shorts or even shorter sleeves. In 9 days, making sure you rub the cream in VIGOROUSLY and in an UPWARD MOTION NOT CIRCULAR, you will know for sure that you want to continue to use the Alluxe Naturals cream. As for me, I can&#x27;t wait until day 10, day 11, day 12... and so on. Who knows? I just might wear shorts this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate to receive this product at a promotional cost in exchange for my HONEST &amp; UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true story and my honest opinion</li>
    <li> My skin especially my arms, legs and belly after three kids is stretched out. I have stretch marks on my stretch marks.  The loose skin that seems to be bothering me the most as of late is that on my arms. After only a few days I feel like my arms are starting to tighten.  I know this will come off as too much information, but I used to be able to hold up my arm and shake and see the stretched out fat shake. It was not a pleasant sight. And honestly it bothered me significantly.  You know CVS sells lots of these types of creams and they are lauded as plastic surgery in a can. And they make you pay for it too.  The Alluxe Naturals brand is super affordable by comparison, and I am mom of three boys. I love affordable and I love anything that I can squeeze into my budget that helps my self image.  I like that my arms are starting to slowly feel human again.  The rough texture from the stretch marks is almost not noticeable.  A little more time and I should be free of them.  I can hardly wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer I have received this item free or at a discount in exchange my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Smells waiting to determine results</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Bought 2 jars so I could use consistently day and night. Absolutely NO RESULTS!</li>
    <li> Horrible smell.  It might be a good cream but I can&#x27;t get passed the smell to use it.</li>
    <li> I really do not like the way this product smells, at all! However, I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and see how it works in respect to what it is suppose to do. Thus, I have been using it regularly, mainly on my thighs and mid-section. While I have not noticed a difference yet, I feel like everything takes time and you cannot notice a difference in just a week even. I will update this review once I have used the product longer. I do recommend, to block the smell, wrapping the body part in syran wrap and doing it when you are not leaving the house because of the smell.</li>
    <li> this seems to smooth out my legs where I need it!! I love this product!!</li>
    <li> Sooo in love with the way this makes my upper thighs look!!</li>
    <li> Just started using not to long ago, but it seems to have made a difference . I like the results so I want to keep using to see what happens</li>
    <li> I got 2 jars of this. Used it consistently as directed.  No change.  It smells awful too.  Would have been worth the smell if it actually worked.</li>
    <li> I received this product for a good deal for testing and reviewing purposes. I am giving it a four star due to the smell; it just smells like &#x27;medication&#x27; to me and it reminds me of being in the hospital back home. Sorry guys, the smell is not so pleasant and I am just glad this product does not go on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Well let&#x27;s talk about the product. The product is very easy to apply. After a good exfoliation, I apply this bad boy and let it dry before getting dressed. I use it twice a day (as recommended) and I have also been drinking a lot of water to help with detox or releasing the toxins out of my body. Well it&#x27;s been a little over a week and I am not expecting my cellulite to disappear just like that, BUT it has really soften the appearance of my cellulite as well as smoothing and hydrating my skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a couple of months. Also remember to eat a healthy diet as well as exercising as it helps speed up your results. This is a recommended product if you&#x27;re okay with the smell (i guess i have a sensitive nose lol).</li>
    <li> OK this product actually works!  Seriously In one week I can see a difference!  The backs of my legs are smoother and feel tighter!  I received a discount on this item in return for a fair review.  I can promise you, I will be buying this product again.  Would be worth it at double the price!  I wish I had taken before pictures but trust me, it does work :)  Thank you Alluxe!</li>
    <li> used this product for a few days and is already working. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my thighs along with working out and have seen a noticeable difference I&#x27;ll spare you pictures lets just say the hail dAmage is more like marble size instead of goofball size. My only qualm is the smell is off putting for me and my hubby even notices and comments that I&#x27;ve applied the dent repair cream.</li>
    <li> The smell was extremely smelly, it smelled like rotten yeast. I tried it anyways thinking the smell would go away and it didn&#x27;t it made me sick. Even after showering a couple times I could still smell it. I couldn&#x27;t tell if it worked or not because the smell was so bad.</li>
    <li> Worked good but has a horrible smell.</li>
    <li> I just started to use this , but I LOVE the way this product makes my skin feel. I have tried other cellulite creams in the past, and this one works much better.</li>
    <li> I have two different cellulite aids that I&#x27;ve been using. One of them is a mitt and the other is a cupping set.  Until I was given the opportunity to review the Cellulite Cream I had been using oils or lotions. I hadn&#x27;t been using anything that was specific to the need which seemed like a waste! I&#x27;ve provided my review on this product in part because I was provided a reduced price point and mostly because of the great benefits! I watched a few youtube videos on best practices for reducing cellulite and feel very confident that I&#x27;ve not only seen great results but that I&#x27;ve also done so in a safe way. The Cellulite Cream will become a beauty staple for me!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed anything different since using</li>
    <li> Great product. Three weeks and those ugly back thigh cellulite areas are diminishing. Headed south next month and hoping I can wear my bathing suit with confidence. Well, some confidence lol. This company has a great cream that does the job. With free shipping, great proce and the results so far, it is my pleasure to give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful! I can see a light smoothing and evening out in my skin around my thigh areas where I have been paying thr cream. I can&#x27;t wait to post the full results in a few weeks!</li>
    <li> Guys aren&#x27;t plagued with the cellulite problem the way women are, but that doesn&#x27;t mean this Cellulite Cream isn&#x27;t meant for men, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream absorbs rapidly into the skin to deliver caffeine to  burn fat and retinol to stimulate collagen production, the result is a tightening of sagging skin. I use it on those embarrassing crepe paper looking areas (like under the arms )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream does attack the cellulite problem, but for guys it really does improve the areas mentioned in addition to tightening that belly fat that tends to hangs over the belt.. Does it all go miraculously away? No, but with in a couple of weeks of using this soothing cream there is a definite improvement. I found it to be a great supplement to my diet and exercise routine.</li>
    <li> Using it on my arms and legs my butt and yes I&#x27;m starting to notice a difference I like how it feels on my skin. Im trying to lose weight and will be using this daily to help all the cellulite go away make my body tighter!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it. We all get older like it or not. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed when I was in my early 20&#x27;s all those things you hear middle aged people talk about would happen to me. Well, here I am, middle-aged. So I decided to give this cellulite cream a try. The shipping was great and came very fast. I do have to say the first day I tried the cream I was impressed. It absorbed into my skin immediately and did not leave a greasy feeling at all. It also has a very faint pleasant scent. The scent is probably from the camphor that is in the cream. After just a couple days of using this cream my skin already feels softer and slightly firmer. The best part I liked about this Allure cellulite cream is that it is made in the USA! I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I really loved this cream.  I have had four surgeries to my abdomen area and it is now no longer soft or firm.  I wanted to try this cream to see if it could help with either problem.  The product arrived very quickly which is always a plus.  I have been using this product for about a week and it is working really well.  My skin is very smooth and I can feel it is slightly firmer. It does not have a strong odor, which is great for my family that have a lot of allergies.  The cellulite cream is very smooth.  Another plus for this product is it is made in the USA which I look for in the products I buy.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a smoothing and firming cream.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cellulite cream. I really like the way it goes on and absorbs in the skin so fast. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or greasy feeling on your skin is such a bonus. The smell is nice and not to powerful which makes it pleasant to use. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tightening and becoming firmer whish means this cream does as it claims. I would recommend this cellulite cream to anyone looking for a cream with a good price, large jar, and really works.</li>
    <li> This creme came in a nice size container with fast shipping.  It is also made in USA.  It uses retinol and caffeine to smooth out your skin.  The creme is light and not greasy at all.  Very easy to apply.  I followed directions and used a teaspoon on my upper thighs.  I applied it in a upward motion not circular per instructons too.  It was absorbed in my skin quickly.  I noticed right away it made the area tighter, firmer and noticeably smoother.  My thighs are looking better in only a few days.  I will definitely continue using.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on smooth without stickiness or strong ordor. My skin is starting to have smaller cellulite bumps. It&#x27;s been almost a month and I love what I see. This cream is perfect for anyone with skin sensitivity. I&#x27;m very picky what cream or lotion I put on as most cream is too oily or makes me itchy or have a rash.  This product feels great and it&#x27;s safe on my skin. I am still using it and LOVE IT!!!  To all the ladies....\\&quot;there&#x27;s a price for beauty&#x27;, but this product is one of the least costly. It&#x27;s effective. IT WORKS!!! IT WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> It definitely makes the skin look firm and smooth but I dont see my cellulite disappearing or fading.  :(</li>
    <li> The first thing i noticed was the smell! IT IS HORRIBLE! i didn&#x27;t even want to use it but i did. I did not notice much of a difference and while the creams texture was nice and moisturized somewhat.. I just could not get past the smell, even with nice lotion over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
    <li> I got this cream to get rid of cellulite on my thighs. Like some other reviewers reported, this does have a smell, but if it works I don&#x27;t mind the smell. I have been using it for a short time but it seems to have a tightening effect. I&#x27;ll keep using it to get full benefits. The size of jar is quite big so it will last for some time. It has caffeine in it which is said to give skin a tightening effect. I&#x27;ll see how my thighs look after I have used the full jar.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this cream. It is creamy and nourishing for a cellulite cream. There is no overly strong scent in my opinion. There is also no burning or excessively cooling sensation for those who may be sensitive to that. It is a bit more liquid-like consistency than others.  I am adding this to my love handles too. The retinol and caffeine are the main ingredients. I keep this right in my bathroom so I don&#x27;t forget to apply it. When ever I go to my bathroom I can apply it since I have it right on the back of my toilet. It won&#x27;t be an occasion of out of site out of mind for me. I am determined to see the best result and am using it consistently.I have only been using it for a few days and while my cellulite is not gone I can feel my skin smoother and can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> i was pleasantly surprised with this product i have a $300 cellulite machine that doesnt work this good.  i wanted to try it because i had heard great things about it and its true!!!  this product is awesome its not greasy and my skins is noticeably tighter and softer.  i am in heaven and working my way up to being ready to wear a bathing suit comfortably!!!  so thank you so much for this awesome product i recommend it to everyone looking for something that will actually work on them at a great price!!!</li>
    <li> This seems to work.  I don&#x27;t know about the smell.  Perhaps adding a little essential oil will help with the aroma.</li>
    <li> The smell is quite awful and also, this product does not produce the promised results. I had no reduction in cellulite after one month of use. I did not notice any firming or smoothing of my skin either. I would say, save yourself the money and try something else.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend use to this product and she loves how smooth and soothing it went on her thigh. She said it brighten her skin as well as clean the pores.</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and I can feel my skin smoother, Good quality product</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good cream - it doesn&#x27;t really remove my cellulite, but it looks a little less like cellulite.  I actually like using it under my neck better.  As a neck-firming cream, this stuff is really good.  Try it for that, as well as body cellulite.  I think you will be happily surprised.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a great smelling and great working cellulite cream the one from Alluxe Naturals is one worth giving a shot. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering. I have been using it 2 times a day for the last few weeks and have noticed smoother skin and better looking skin. I have noticed a slight difference to my stretch mark and that is a HUGE plus! The cellulite cream does not leave a greasy feeling which is also good. I hate feeling greasy and oil. This has been a godsend!</li>
    <li> Really good cream, left skin silky and smooth. Only tried for a week but skin feels better already! Fast and free delivery too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week and I&#x27;m amazed at the results. My skin already feels softer and marks are disappearing!</li>
    <li> happily surprised! I&#x27;ve been using this cream a few days now and loving the results already! my skin is smoother and looks healthier, even my stitch marks seems to be looking less and less noticeable! very pleased and will be looking forward to purchasing again when this tub is gone!</li>
    <li> I got this stuff and I love it I am in a routine that I get my bath at night time and then I put this on afterward. I put it especially on my butt and stomach that is where most of my cellulite is at. Since I started using this I have seen the cellulite disappear I am not so upset about how I look any more because of this great stuff.</li>
    <li> A product that does what it says! I have been using this on my thighs, which is probably a problem area for a lot of women. In a week I have noticed less dimpling and my skin is so soft. I am currently trying to lose weight and plan on using this on my stomach to help firm up the skin on my belly as the weight comes off!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream and I saw results on the first two weeks. I honestly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wish i can give this zero stars. Smells terrible and does NOT work at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and have started to see real results and it has even made my skin feel smoother and tighter as I see the dimples vanish away. Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t tell you how to use it except to apply. I applied it once a day, although I maybe should have did it more frequently however I could tell a difference. I used this on my tummy as I have stretch marks and cellulite. I still have them but this product did make my skin more toned. I hope with continued use and maybe more applications this will be a miracle product. I will try this on other areas as well.</li>
    <li> I dislike the smell! Will not buy it again...</li>
    <li> This cream is great...it has a bit of a smell...but it works really well!</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised with this cream! First off I was happy with the free shipping and the fact that it arrived on time. The cream is odorless and non greasy. I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long but so far I can tell a difference as my skin is both softer and tighter than before. Very happy with my results!</li>
    <li> This cream really works, my second jar is on the way! Perfect when paired with exercise, lots of water &amp; diet!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this cream, its been 3 weeks so far and even I can see the difference, skin looks smoother and what she likes the most about it is that is not greasy and the smell its great. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> i was so excited to get this cream at an amazing price. it has a light smell and goes on great. it doesnt leave a greasy feeling after putting it on. i have noticed that my stretch marks are starting to fade and my cellulite problem areas are slowly making improvements. this is the first time i have attempted to use cellulite cream but i am very impressed. i recommend giving this stuff a try.</li>
    <li> I received this Alluxe cellulite cream for a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I have been using this cellulite cream for a week now and I have noticed a difference on my legs. I want to point out that the only reason that this product is not receiving five stars is because of the smell. I&#x27;ve tried to pinpoint the smell and the closest I can come up with is stale coffee. The smell lingers all day so if you&#x27;re someone with a sensitive nose or you just don&#x27;t want to smell like stale coffee, this might not be the product for you. With that being said, the cellulite cream works. I have lost 40 pounds over the past year and my legs look kind of bad at this point since I wasn&#x27;t consistently toning my legs to keep the skin tight. Within a few days of using this product I have been able to say that the cellulite is not visible. Not visible from far away or close up :) As much as I don&#x27;t like the scent, I like the fact that my cellulite is gone even more. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Goes on easy, not greasy, not oily.  I have noticed decreased cellulite in my thighs and buttocks where I put it on.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this and received at a lower price.  I would recommend anyone to try this even men as some have cellulite.</li>
    <li> i am totally impressed with Alluxe  , I have been using it for 2 weeks and I see a definite difference in the dimpling in my butt. Alluxe is light cream and has an amazing absorption .</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend (per her request). She has been using it for several weeks now and has enjoyed it very much. The cream is smooth and goes on easily. Also, she reports it has definitely helped tighten and tone her thighs. Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with cellulite. This stuff minimizes the look of it!! I would recommend to anyone :)</li>
    <li> This is an anti-cellulite cream that increases your skins smoothness and fights to reduce the presence of fat cells using retinol &amp; caffeine as its main ingredients. It has a slight minty scent and is so silky smooth.  I could feel my skin tighten after my first application. It smoothes and firms any area including thighs, abdomen, love handles, buttocks, even that embarrassing saggy arm area. A must-have in every women’s medicine chest!</li>
    <li> Becareful if u have sensitive skin. Try on a small area before fully applying it on the targeted zone. Great scent and easy to apply. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> This cream feels wonderful as it goes onto the skin! It absorbs quickly and really leaves my skin feeling moisturized. I&#x27;ve put it on my stomach, and, while I can&#x27;t say my problem is GONE, I do see some improvement. I&#x27;m excited to have received this for review and definitely will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> One of the first things I want to address is the smell of this product. I have to admit it is not the most pleasant of scents, which is really a shame. With that being said, once you actually apply the cream to the skin the smell will dissipate and barely be noticeable.i have been using this in the evening and I bun a soothing wax melt of essential oil to cover the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and can work wonders for the skin. I have been using this and loving it every single night. I have been fortunate enough to have a husband who is willing to slowly rub this in. So yes I have snookered a massage out of him every night of the week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a miracle cure! Do not expect results the first night of use. However, after a little over a week my skin is so much softer! There does seem to be a noticeable firmness as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep updating as I continue to use it. I dropped one star off simply because of the scent. However, don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying it, it is a really incredible skin product.</li>
    <li> I just started used&lt;br /&gt;But a see different. ..</li>
    <li> I like everything about this cream ! It has a great texture , the scent is light and comforting , I love it comes in a tub v.&#x27;s a tube or pump and You can feel it working when you apply it !! I find it&#x27;s best to apply it right after the shower . Put it on your problem area and rub it in well you will feel your skin absorbing this wonderful lotion ! I also love the nice mild scent it&#x27;s nice . I am so happy I received a chance to review this product . It truly is great !</li>
    <li> This lightly scented, non-greasy cream works great. I have been applying daily to my hands, elbows and thighs and have noticed a smooth, firming effect. I feel like I&#x27;m gaining some long lost elasticity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family has severe eczema and food allergies that result in rashes. We are always looking for lotions/creams that are non-irritating and add back moisture and softness. We&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by this product. We purchased this product at a discount in order to test and review, and I&#x27;m glad I did. Cellulite or not, it&#x27;s a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to continued use of the cream and expect the benefits to continue.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a friend and she loves it! She said she&#x27;s already noticing her skin getting softer, which has made it better looking, more healthy, and it seems to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; her skin. Not sure if it&#x27;s doing any permanent benefits, but she loves it to de puff her eyes!</li>
    <li> Great product! If you are looking for a great smelling and great working cellulite cream the one from Alluxe Naturals is one worth giving a shot. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering. I recently lost over 108 lbs so I really want to keep using a cellulite cream because they are great. And this one is already showing signs of working, skin appears more hydrated &amp; the overall tone is changing for the better. Nothing has totally disappeared yet but I can see the reactions starting to happen. It is not greasy so that is another plus &amp; it absorbs in fast leaving skin feeling softer right away.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about a cream actually helping cellulite but when I was offered a chance to try this product for review I figured &amp;#34;Why not&amp;#34;.  Whats the worst that could happen. I got it super cheap so I gave it a try.  I have always carried the bulk of my weight in my thighs and as I age the cellulite is becoming more obvious.  I am not over weight and I exercise regularly but still have lots of cellulite on my thighs which is increasing as I age.  When I first opened this cream I noticed there was no heavy fragrance.  Virtually no scent at all other than what comes naturally from the ingredients. That is a big bonus for me because I have sensitivities to artificial fragrances.  When I applied the cream I noticed it is quite heavy and requires a bit of rubbing to spread.  I used way too much at first and had to try to spread it from one leg to another.  It absorbs nicely and after a few days of use I dare say I can see a subtle difference in my legs.  They seem tighter and less jiggly.  I am hoping that with continued use I will get even better results but any improvement is awesome in my book.</li>
