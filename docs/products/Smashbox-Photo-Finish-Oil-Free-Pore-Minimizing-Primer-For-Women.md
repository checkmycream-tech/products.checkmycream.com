      <li>but when I went for this big purchase of the full size, it came with a tint, and did not go on flawlessly like the clear samples.  </li>

      <li>it&#x27;s really fill my pores</li>
      <li>This goes along with #2 above, but the end texture is smooth and matte and not at all oily.  </li>
      <li>, I really had high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the clear Smashbox photo finish foundation primer, so when I found this specific one I purchased it since I do have large visible pores.  </li>
      <li>would highly recommend this</li>
      <li>used the new makeup for ever skin equalizer in</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what to do with the left over stuff, but I&#x27;m definitely going back to my favorite clear Smashbox photo finish.  </li>
      <li>It makes the skin smooth and the foundation application less patchy</li>
      <li>and you do have to apply foundation on top because it can leave cakey looking streaks (at least on my skin).  </li>
      <li>Make your skin feel so soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a different consistency than the clear one</li>
      <li>I was really disappointed and was glad I still had a clear sample to use for my son&#x27;s wedding, as this full size was not up to par.</li>
      <li>and I have tried other oil absorbing products.  </li>

    <li> this product is great. really smooths my skin and balances my complexion. add foundation on top and it is a nice finished look. would highly recommend this</li>
    <li> This is a God send for anyone with particularly oily skin!</li>
    <li> Loving this primer so far</li>
    <li> Very good product that makes your skin look great. I use this over my moisturizer and after I apply it I use my foundation. I really like the look I get and it does hold up well for me throughout the day.</li>
    <li> The best primer out there at a cheaper price here on Amazon. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I had gotten tiny samples of this product (exact same name on label) and I REALLY liked them!! It was colorless and made my 60+ year old skin look amazing... but when I went for this big purchase of the full size, it came with a tint, and did not go on flawlessly like the clear samples.  I would not purchase this again as the tint was not mentioned in the description and does not go on in the same way. It was a bit streaky and the more I tried to blend it, the more it dried and pilled. I was really disappointed and was glad I still had a clear sample to use for my son&#x27;s wedding, as this full size was not up to par.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I often wear it alone as foundation.</li>
    <li> Favorite primer. It makes the skin smooth and the foundation application less patchy&lt;br /&gt;I used the new makeup for ever skin equalizer in</li>
    <li> Love the way it goes on and looks great. Make your skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> I love this primer out of all primers. It leaves it smooth and matte but not dry matte. It&#x27;s just my absolute favorite and I would recommend it to all my friends and family and even my mom started using it. So it works wonders</li>
    <li> Its ok...I will stick with porefessional from Benefit...</li>
    <li> It is an amazing primer.  It just glides on and provides the perfect background for any king of makeup you use.  I absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have the most oily skin and I have tried other oil absorbing products.  Smashbox had other product for oil absorbing, but it has been discontinued.  This is really great!!  it looks like a foundation, but it goes on smooth, feels like a powder, but soft.  And the best part is, I did not see any oil break through during the day!!  I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the clear Smashbox photo finish foundation primer, so when I found this specific one I purchased it since I do have large visible pores.  It&#x27;s a different consistency than the clear one and you do have to apply foundation on top because it can leave cakey looking streaks (at least on my skin).  I wore it yesterday and this morning  (i washed all of my make up off yesterday before bed) I noticed clusters of small pimples on my face.  They weren&#x27;t huge, but I could definitely see them developing under the skin.  I don&#x27;t have an acne problem, but it looked like I was about to get some.  So all in all, for me, this did blur the pores for that photo finish during makeup application, but clogged them up as well.  I don&#x27;t know what to do with the left over stuff, but I&#x27;m definitely going back to my favorite clear Smashbox photo finish.  Makes me sad though, I really had high hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> This works great for filling in my pores!</li>
    <li> This hits all the highlights of a foundation primer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Doesn&#x27;t break my skin out or irritate me in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Doesn&#x27;t interfere with makeup application.  (This sounds almost silly to have to say, but I have used primers in the past that were far too oily for me and prevented my makeup from setting right.)  For the record, I have combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry cheeks.  This seems to be doing the trick in both areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Texture.  This goes along with #2 above, but the end texture is smooth and matte and not at all oily.  Just exactly what i want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) Tint.  This has a nice tint that has a bit of coverage of its own.  It&#x27;s not too dark for my (pale) skin.  May want to obtain a sample and do a spot test if you have darker skin, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5) Lack of shine.  Even after 9 hours, my nose and forehead and chin aren&#x27;t shiny (I&#x27;m using some Neutrogena liquid foundation and powder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, I can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about this product.  It is one of my top primers ever.</li>
    <li> The primer is easy to apply and feels ok on the skin. It evens the texture out some, but it definately requires a foundation to go over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this product cause me to get little red pimples, so I don&#x27;t want to use it</li>
    <li> Love the feeling of it, very light and makes make up go on so smooth.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and your skin feels very smooth.</li>
    <li> Best primer I have used for my oily skin.  Covers pores and reduces oil production.</li>
    <li> no different than the rest. poor result.</li>
    <li> Fills my pore lovely!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, love this item</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shock that it&#x27;s now 32$ and i bought it for 43$ ! just few days ago , it arrived late but i love it , this is by far the best primer i used it&#x27;s really fill my pores and it&#x27;s so silky .</li>
    <li> I bought this product and I hate it!!! I thought it would be great and all I am is greatly disappointed! I have oily but it made me break out like I was a teenager and I am 42...I look terrible ..don&#x27;t waste your money. .</li>
