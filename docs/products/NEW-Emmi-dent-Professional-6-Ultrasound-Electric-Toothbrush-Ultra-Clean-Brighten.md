### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent toorhbrush!</li>
      <li>I used the product for three days and was very happy with it, actually I loved it until it stopped working, The on/ off button no longer turns the unit on.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still getting great results.  </li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>It may be a good product, but did not meet my hopes.</li>
      <li>Hope his results are as good as mine.    </li>
      <li>While cleaning and examining my teeth, the Dentist ask me if I had been flossing a lot because my teeth and gums looks so good.  </li>
      <li>The best clean I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this system!  </li>
      <li>From my first use of the Emmi-Dent, I could tell that this was doing an excellent job of cleaning my teeth and improving my gums.  </li>
      <li>It is nice to let the brush do all the work while I admire the potted plant on the window sill.</li>
      <li>and I actually liked it, when it worked.  </li>
      <li>The results honestly floored me.  </li>
      <li>If it kills bacteria like the company claims, I beleive everyone should own one.  </li>
      <li>I never have had so many comments from the dentist or the hygienist about how great my gums looked and what a fantastic job I had done preventing tartar build up.</li>
      <li>Just beware, it&#x27;s a good toothbrush and does a fine job</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big Sonic Care toothbrush user and this is a wonderful addition to my routine.  </li>
      <li>Somebody make a better NANO toothpaste.    </li>
      <li>My dentist was impressed enough to start carrying ultrasonic systems in his office.      </li>
      <li>I have flossed, used a WaterPik, and a SoniCare toothbrush twice a day for many many years.</li>
      <li>Keeping my gums healthy with so many crowns has always been quite a struggle.</li>
      <li>i love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for over a month now, and my teeth are whiter and my gums are looking healthy again.  </li>
      <li>The Emmi-Dent is the best defense I have against increasing medical costs.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s already better than any toothbrush I have owned.</li>
      <li>It does not matter how much I love the product if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I am NOT an Emmident employee or associated with them in any way, just a really satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it&#x27;s the best cleaning either of them has ever had outside of a dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
      <li>Also it uses a special kind of polish/paste.  </li>
      <li>It seemed to perform great at first then didn&#x27;t seem to clean as well, replaced the head  twice</li>
      <li>and he said there was great improvement and infection was almost completely cleared up.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s that easy.  </li>
      <li>My primary reason for getting this item was to minimize my need for follow-up periodontal care.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It leaves my teeth feeling and looking clean.  </li>
      <li>I have read reviews about people complaining about the cost of the toothpaste, but with a clean like this - who cares?</li>
      <li>It gets 5 stars because it makes teeth feel clean</li>
      <li>This toothbrush makes your teeth feel clean.  </li>
      <li>The professional treatment was amazing but didn&#x27;t last.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I am super anal about my teeth and when I found the Emmi-dent 6 100% Ultrasonic Toothbrush I had to have it.</li>
      <li>On the kids, I&#x27;m going to let them continue normal brushing in the morning, &amp; we&#x27;ll use the Emmi-Dent at night when we have more time.  </li>
      <li>The first couple of days I did exactly as described above - just sitting the toothbrush on two to three teeth at a time and my teeth still felt wonderful and had that just professionally cleaned feeling.  </li>
      <li>It might even be useful beyond confirming that the brush is working.</li>
      <li>The manual in the box which you can download from their official site, http://www.emag-germany.de/userFiles/de/downloads/Emmi-dent-EN-Web.pdf tells you the contents of either Pro version should contain the tarter removal tool &amp; pills which let you view cleaning success or lack there of.    </li>
      <li>it a true try, do exactly as described for a couple of days</li>
      <li>The vibration is not anything more than a regular sound of a electric toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>it a true try, do exactly as described for a couple of days</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth always look worse than my husband&#x27;s and my best friend&#x27;s, even though neither of them floss.  </li>
      <li>When I wake up in the morning my mouth still feels just as fresh as it did right after I cleaned my teeth before retiring the night before.</li>
      <li>When I use the Emmi-dent toothbrush with the accompanying toothpaste for 5 or more minutes, my teeth still don&#x27;t feel clean, and don&#x27;t seem to look as white as with my Oral B.  </li>
      <li>I will right another review after that dental visit.</li>
      <li>First, you have to really want to spend the time to clean your teeth every time.  </li>
      <li>My dentist confirmed that they are a healthy pink color now and do not bleed like before.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m confident they&#x27;ll get the hang of it after a few more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, even when I really tried to stick to the 15 seconds for each section, my teeth didn&#x27;t really feel clean.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, I just had my first dental check since using Emmi-dent, and I&#x27;m now a believer.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think this is worth the money.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel smooth like they do after a professional cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel professionally cleaned and the clean feeling lasts and lasts.</li>
      <li>I looked for reviews on the internet and every one that I found was positive.</li>
      <li>toothbrush is extremely easy to use - just turn it on to kill any bacteria, then turn it off, apply toothpaste and turn it back on.  </li>
      <li>What I&#x27;m positive of after a few uses is that, if I were starting with freshly cleaned, tartar free teeth, this toothbrush would keep them that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my husband to order the child-sized toothbrush attachments, too, so I was able to try the Emmi-Dent out with my 12 and 9-year-old sons.  </li>
      <li>I have always had to brush and floss a ton to keep the plaque deposits at bay, and even that doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
      <li>Before my first brushing, my teeth were in their normal condition.  </li>
      <li>I can see where the Emmi-Dent would be really helpful in combination and for preserving the effects of any whitening treatment.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I was much more careful inserting and removing the brush heads after that, and they seem to have straightened</li>
      <li>I own several different \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; tooth brushes -</li>
      <li>This tooth brush would be better value for money if it also worked with completely natural teeth and gum products which contain organic essential oils that kill bacteria, etc.</li>
      <li>Using this item it seems like how can this actually clean my teeth with we all are used to doing the regular brushing.  </li>
      <li>They claim it is not necessary to make the ultrasonic heads clean the teeth</li>
      <li>price tag is high, I cringed when I made that purchase, but one filling is almost that much</li>
      <li>The ultrasonic head makes no noise or vibration as it operates; they added a slight vibration and a bit of noise, just because that it what most people expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It will be interesting to see how my next cleaning goes especially with my gums.</li>
      <li>I think my expectations were set too high based on all the hype seen in the videos.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The reason for this is its has hydrated silica which is listed high in the ingredient list on the emident toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Like I mentioned above, I am extremely anal about my teeth and love the super clean feeling so much that I am probably going a little overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better results than I could get by holding them down and using a floss pick on them!</li>
      <li>I know that the pocketing that was forming near one tooth is much improved as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit strange at first as the brushes really don&#x27;t move much at all, and you just hold the brushes against your teeth, no brushing involved.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say if there&#x27;s some kind of extra sterilization going on -- but based on feel and looks only, I&#x27;ve gone back to using my Oral B one-half of the time.  </li>
      <li>You get the listed parts and depicted BUT your item arrives in a new sealed shrink wrapped box</li>
      <li>far as whitening effects, it&#x27;s a bit too early to give a verdict, but I think it&#x27;s going to be very helpful.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had plaque and gum problems from a very young age, in spite of diligent brushing and flossing.  </li>
      <li>No cavities, very little tartar, gums healthy.      </li>
      <li>This is the same review that I wrote for this same toothbrush except that this actual order of mine included the TheraSol rinse option, which is refreshing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband said \\&quot;wow\\&quot; &amp; started joking that the toothbrush must operate on alien technology. :)</li>
      <li>first I had a little bit of an issue that the toothbrush did not shut off after a certain amount of time, like two minutes, but now I really like that feature.</li>
      <li>During my first Emmi-Dent cleaning, I was careful NOT to brush or floss, just to use the toothbrush as designed, holding it against the teeth gently.</li>
      <li>My gums have red (vs. pink) areas, and a couple of my teeth bleed easily.  </li>
      <li>I buy whitening strips, use a whitening rinse, and have had a professional whitening treatment.  </li>
      <li>If you are still using an old fashioned tooth brush, what are you waiting for?</li>
      <li>That is, the gentle physical vibration may help dislodge plaque from the teeth after it has been loosened by the ultrasound which is not detectable.</li>
      <li>It looked and felt as if I had just had a professional cleaning.  </li>
      <li>So far, I would not buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Entitled Emmi-Dent 6 Professional.  </li>
      <li>If something goes wrong, good luck.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Although I like this tooth brush, it&#x27;s not worth the money.  It does not completely remove all plaque like stated.  Just beware, it&#x27;s a good toothbrush and does a fine job but I feel it&#x27;s NOT worth this much money.</li>
    <li> I think my expectations were set too high based on all the hype seen in the videos. It may be a good product, but did not meet my hopes.</li>
    <li> I used this toothbrush about once a month,  preferring my other electric toothbrushes.  I have had it 2 years, and now it will not charge so is an expensive item that is completely useless. Is that planned obsolescence or what?</li>
    <li> I like the concept behind this brush, but I will know better after I revisit my dentist to compare before and after.  My primary reason for getting this item was to minimize my need for follow-up periodontal care.</li>
    <li> Poor quality!  DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this 3 months ago and both pins have come out so now it is useless!!  $200 bucks and it lasts 3 months.</li>
    <li> This item arrived within the time period specified.  Using this item it seems like how can this actually clean my teeth with we all are used to doing the regular brushing.  You just leave the toothbrush on a couple of teeth at a time and just let the toothbrush sit on the teeth; then move to next couple teeth.  when I ordered my toothbrush I gotten a rinse that came with the brush and I just use the rinse after I use the emmi dent.  The vibration is not anything more than a regular sound of a electric toothbrush.  It just takes time to not brush.  It will be interesting to see how my next cleaning goes especially with my gums.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush makes your teeth feel clean.  If it kills bacteria like the company claims, I beleive everyone should own one.  One thing the company should offer is one without the noisy motor.  They claim it is not necessary to make the ultrasonic heads clean the teeth so they shold just replace it with just a light, the motor is highly annoying.  It gets 5 stars because it makes teeth feel clean and you do not have to brush.  A must for kids and anyone with teeth.  Another downside is the toothpaste.  It has chemicals in it that I avoid, and tastes bad.  I bought silica gel and for my daughter I bought Xyli White toothpaste made by Now Solutions -Strawberry Splash flavour.  The reason for this is its has hydrated silica which is listed high in the ingredient list on the emident toothpaste.  It appears to foam as well as the emmi-dent toothpaste.</li>
    <li> It seemed to perform great at first then didn&#x27;t seem to clean as well, replaced the head  twice and then it stopped working. After all that, my dental cleaning was just average. So I don&#x27;t know if the ultrasonic portion broke at some point before the motor or battery broke. Either way I&#x27;ve only had it for 7 months... Pretty expensive and I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, maybe if got a defective unit. I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Not happy AT ALL.  The battery would not re-charge after a month.  Emailed the company and had NO RESPONSE.  EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuck with a non-working $400 toothbrush.  I&#x27;m furious.  They have CRAP service, and don&#x27;t give a da** about their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son and I actually liked it, when it worked.  Buy at your peril.  If something goes wrong, good luck.</li>
    <li> A little strange to get use to.  You do not brush.  You hold it to your teeth.  Also it uses a special kind of polish/paste.  So I switch back and forth.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this toothbrush.  What I like is that the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have an aftertaste, but I have several issues with the toothbrush.  First, you have to really want to spend the time to clean your teeth every time.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like a long time, but five minutes adds up.  I got to the point, where I wouldn&#x27;t spend the entire time.  However, even when I really tried to stick to the 15 seconds for each section, my teeth didn&#x27;t really feel clean.  I had been using oral B and my teeth always felt cleaner after just two minutes.  My toothbrush never lasted 7 days after being fully charged.  I really don&#x27;t think this is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I brought this expensive unit to help manage my gum disease. Only time will tell if the actual tooth brush does what it says it will do. My biggest concern and disappointment was to discover the tooth paste is made of chemicals, including parabens and fluoride which are known to aggravate gum disease. I contacted the company and their solution was to purchase their &amp;#34;nature&amp;#34; version, but it too is not &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. This tooth brush would be better value for money if it also worked with completely natural teeth and gum products which contain organic essential oils that kill bacteria, etc.</li>
    <li> Although I was skeptical at first about this toothbrush, after using it for a month, I am confident that it will make the need for periodontal visits unnecessary.  I&#x27;ve had plaque and gum problems from a very young age, in spite of diligent brushing and flossing.  From my first use of the Emmi-Dent, I could tell that this was doing an excellent job of cleaning my teeth and improving my gums.  I have been using it for over a month now, and my teeth are whiter and my gums are looking healthy again.  I know that the pocketing that was forming near one tooth is much improved as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know several people that have a gag reflex when brushing with a conventional toothbrush.  Switching to an electric model has helped them.  However, the Emmi-Dent makes so little vibration and intrusion, that I will be recommending it to them.  The ultrasonic head makes no noise or vibration as it operates; they added a slight vibration and a bit of noise, just because that it what most people expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I still floss.  The Emmi-Dent is the best defense I have against increasing medical costs.  It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Love this system!  My mouth feels cleaner than with Oral B.  I believe I could have avoided gum issues had I used Emmi-dent years ago.  Even now, I&#x27;m convinced I will see some improvement using these products consciencously.</li>
    <li> I was using this toothbrush and the Emmi dent NanoPaste for a few weeks before going to a regularly scheduled dentist appointment.  While cleaning and examining my teeth, the Dentist ask me if I had been flossing a lot because my teeth and gums looks so good.  I told him what I had been using - he never heard of the toothbrush  --  but you can&#x27;t mess with results.</li>
    <li> Use it every day. The best clean I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big Sonic Care toothbrush user and this is a wonderful addition to my routine.  If you are still using an old fashioned tooth brush, what are you waiting for?</li>
    <li> I watched for a couple of years to see if this was just a gimmick and noticed price never fell so wanting healthier teeth I jumped in.    I LIKE IT.  It does work.  My teeth were immediately cleaner and whiter.  I floss and what I floss off isn&#x27;t even malodorous.    Yes NOT MOVING your hand is hard to do and I miss brushing so I still brush the regular way with my other electric occasionally.  What can I say, I miss the feeling.    What I can&#x27;t stand is their nano toothpaste.  eeeeeeeeuuuuuuyick!    The mint version contains fluoride, saccharin and probably synthetic mint.  All of which make me gag.  The NATURE version doesn&#x27;t have any of those three ingredients thankfully but its like a flour water paste and it too is dreadful tasting.    Somebody make a better NANO toothpaste.    The Therasol mouthwash not as bad as the toothpastes.    The seller did get on my nerves and yes I&#x27;ve posted this in their feedback like I&#x27;m supposed to.    You get the listed parts and depicted BUT your item arrives in a new sealed shrink wrapped box Entitled Emmi-Dent 6 Professional.  The manual in the box which you can download from their official site, http://www.emag-germany.de/userFiles/de/downloads/Emmi-dent-EN-Web.pdf tells you the contents of either Pro version should contain the tarter removal tool &amp; pills which let you view cleaning success or lack there of.    Neither are in the box you will get from this seller!    Oratec&#x27;s response was, \\&quot;Well the Manual must have been the Wrong one.\\&quot;  If that&#x27;s the case then the BOX was the wrong one as well.  Buy on ebay 4 less if you wish a seller who leaves out parts.    I don&#x27;t like seller shenanigans.</li>
    <li> Great product.  No need for other expensive brush and tossed my WaterPik.  Buyinng my daughter one for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;JSB Raleigh, NC</li>
    <li> I have an Oral B toothbrush that I use for 3 minutes at night.  It leaves my teeth feeling and looking clean.  When I use the Emmi-dent toothbrush with the accompanying toothpaste for 5 or more minutes, my teeth still don&#x27;t feel clean, and don&#x27;t seem to look as white as with my Oral B.  I can&#x27;t say if there&#x27;s some kind of extra sterilization going on -- but based on feel and looks only, I&#x27;ve gone back to using my Oral B one-half of the time.  So far, I would not buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 8/28/2013  After continued use, I definitely do see that my teeth are whiter.  I still feel that the product is a bit expensive (along with the toothpaste which you must buy to use with the toothbrush) but it does seem to deliver.  I would probably give it five stars now based on performance, but take it down to three stars when figuring in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  8/1/2014  Have only used this a few times a week, but it died on me.  Will not charge, will not run.  Definitely consider this a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> I asked my husband to get the Emmi-Dent for me as a Christmas gift after reading an article about it in the L.A. Times online.  We were both a little skeptical, but I&#x27;m glad he took the leap and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First a little about my teeth.  I am 40 years old and have decay-resistant teeth (only one cavity), but I am a \\&quot;plaquer\\&quot; and I have gingivitis. I have always had to brush and floss a ton to keep the plaque deposits at bay, and even that doesn&#x27;t really work.  Even after a professional cleaning, within a few days I always seem to get sticky plaque deposits around the margins where my teeth meet my gums.  My gums have red (vs. pink) areas, and a couple of my teeth bleed easily.  My dentist&#x27;s visits always involve a lot of scraping.  Eventually tartar builds up, especially on my lower teeth.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth always look worse than my husband&#x27;s and my best friend&#x27;s, even though neither of them floss.  So unfair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I have Celiac Disease (autoimmune gluten intolerance).  Dental and enamel defects are common in people with Celiac Disease.  In my case, I seem to have enamel that is thinner than usual and prone to staining.  As a result, my teeth look yellow despite the fact that I brush twice a day.  I buy whitening strips, use a whitening rinse, and have had a professional whitening treatment.  The strips and rinse help a bit.  The professional treatment was amazing but didn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve only used the Emmi-Dent for three days now.  I intend to update my review after I&#x27;ve used it longer.  Before my first brushing, my teeth were in their normal condition.  I had brushed them 12 hours before, but they were \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot; feeling, and I had some visible plaque obscuring the lines between teeth.  During my first Emmi-Dent cleaning, I was careful NOT to brush or floss, just to use the toothbrush as designed, holding it against the teeth gently. I wanted to see what it could do.  I&#x27;ll admit I spent about5 minutes carefully moving it from tooth to tooth, but that was it for effort.  I was careful to overlap with the gum line just as I would if brushing.  The results honestly floored me.  It looked and felt as if I had just had a professional cleaning.  Slick teeth with clean margins, sharp lines between each tooth.  My husband said \\&quot;wow\\&quot; &amp; started joking that the toothbrush must operate on alien technology. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as whitening effects, it&#x27;s a bit too early to give a verdict, but I think it&#x27;s going to be very helpful.  The first brushing alone was helpful cosmetically, because plaque color and tooth color can be different, leaving a contrast that is ugly.  That&#x27;s gone. I&#x27;m going to continue using a whitening rinse &amp; strips. I can see where the Emmi-Dent would be really helpful in combination and for preserving the effects of any whitening treatment. I am optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it doesn&#x27;t do (or didn&#x27;t do for me): I have some hardened calculus deposits on the back sides of my lower front teeth.  It didn&#x27;t remove these, or at least not enough for me to tell for sure.  I&#x27;ll have to see if repeated use will make a difference, or if I&#x27;ll just have to wait until my next professional cleaning to get rid of these.  What I&#x27;m positive of after a few uses is that, if I were starting with freshly cleaned, tartar free teeth, this toothbrush would keep them that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my husband to order the child-sized toothbrush attachments, too, so I was able to try the Emmi-Dent out with my 12 and 9-year-old sons.  Both of them have the same sticky plaque problem that I have, and my oldest has really yellow teeth and lots of enamel issues (he also has Celiac Disease - we were diagnosed the same week five years ago).  I had to supervise both of them to keep them from brushing, rinsing and spitting, etc. Both boys also said \\&quot;wow\\&quot; when they saw and felt the results.  Both said their teeth felt slick.  It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it&#x27;s the best cleaning either of them has ever had outside of a dentist&#x27;s office.  Better results than I could get by holding them down and using a floss pick on them! XD  So, despite the fact that it takes a little extra time, both boys are willing to use the new toothbrush if it means I won&#x27;t be coming after them with a floss pick.  On the kids, I&#x27;m going to let them continue normal brushing in the morning, &amp; we&#x27;ll use the Emmi-Dent at night when we have more time.  I&#x27;m confident they&#x27;ll get the hang of it after a few more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the device construction goes, be careful when removing the brush heads from the device.  There are a couple of small metal prongs that have to plug in to the brush.  After a few removals to change brush heads between family members, I noticed the prongs on my brush were \\&quot;leaning\\&quot; to the left.  I was much more careful inserting and removing the brush heads after that, and they seem to have straightened out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, that&#x27;s it for now.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how this performs over time.  It&#x27;s already better than any toothbrush I have owned.</li>
    <li> I am super anal about my teeth and when I found the Emmi-dent 6 100% Ultrasonic Toothbrush I had to have it. I have now been using the toothbrush for a little over a week and I am sold and will never go back to a manual or sonic style toothbrush.  My teeth feel professionally cleaned and the clean feeling lasts and lasts. I have read reviews about people complaining about the cost of the toothpaste, but with a clean like this - who cares? If you don&#x27;t want the cleanest teeth around, buy a cheaper toothbrush and regular toothpaste - if you want the brightest and cleanest teeth, then get this toothbrush and get the toothpaste that goes with it.  I also rinse with Hydrogen Peroxide before and after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I had a little bit of an issue that the toothbrush did not shut off after a certain amount of time, like two minutes, but now I really like that feature. When I used one of the Sonic toothbrushes I would often fire it up again after the initial two minutes - so now I go for as long as I want and don&#x27;t have to start the toothbrush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is extremely easy to use - just turn it on to kill any bacteria, then turn it off, apply toothpaste and turn it back on.  Gently apply the toothbrush to your teeth, covering approximately two to three teeth at a time, and let sit for 5-10 seconds and then move onto the next set of teeth...it&#x27;s that easy.  Now that I have the hang of it I will typically then come back, after I have completed my entire mouth as described above, and go over them again - this time gently brushing in a slight circular motion - very gently and just touching the surface of the teeth; however, this is not necessary. The first couple of days I did exactly as described above - just sitting the toothbrush on two to three teeth at a time and my teeth still felt wonderful and had that just professionally cleaned feeling.  Like I mentioned above, I am extremely anal about my teeth and love the super clean feeling so much that I am probably going a little overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a true try, do exactly as described for a couple of days and I guarantee you will never want to go back to a manual toothbrush or a Sonic version of a toothbrush again.uch that I am probably going a little overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a true try, do exactly as described for a couple of days and I guarantee you will never want to go back to a manual toothbrush or a Sonic version of a toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  My last dental checkup was not good and I&#x27;m hoping this product helps change my next dental visit.  I will right another review after that dental visit. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I own several different \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; tooth brushes - but thought I would give this a try after reading quite a bit about it on line.  It&#x27;s a bit strange at first as the brushes really don&#x27;t move much at all, and you just hold the brushes against your teeth, no brushing involved.  But it really does work, my teeth are whiter, stains are fading, and I have very little morning breath.  My teeth are sort of long and get some darker stains from coffee on the side areas, I do work the brush back and forth some vertically in those areas.  A bit of extra work does the trick there.  Overall my teeth are whiter, brighter and have a smoother feel to them.</li>
    <li> I was not originally blown away by this toothbrush. I did not achieve the whitening that others reported after using the Emmi-dent. HOWEVER, I just had my first dental check since using Emmi-dent, and I&#x27;m now a believer. I never have had so many comments from the dentist or the hygienist about how great my gums looked and what a fantastic job I had done preventing tartar build up. My gums no longer bleed either. The only difference is the Emmi-dent (and the Emmi-dent toothpaste). I will try to update after my husband goes for his check-up next month. Hope his results are as good as mine.    Update:  I have now been using the Emmident for about a year and a half.   I have purchased a second handset, not because mine stopped working, but because my husband took mine.  He saw the results I was getting and we were trying to save him from gum surgery.  We succeeded.  His gums are no longer bleeding or receding.     I just had my fourth dentist visit with glowing reviews.  I am no longer use emmident toothpaste which was expensive and hard to find and I&#x27;m still getting great results.  I did buy the smaller brushes (child sized) because my teeth are small.  Yes, I do brush longer than the two minutes I was doing previously with Sonicare and I do still floss once a day.  For these results???   You bet!    I no longer want a Valium before I go to the dentist.   My dentist was impressed enough to start carrying ultrasonic systems in his office.      I know the almost $200. price tag is high, I cringed when I made that purchase, but one filling is almost that much so I took the chance.  For me and for hubby it paid off big time.    No cavities, very little tartar, gums healthy.      I am NOT an Emmident employee or associated with them in any way, just a really satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I inherited gum disease from my mother.  I have some loose teeth and nothing the dentist has done has helped.  I read about this in Readers Digest and decided to see if it helps.</li>
    <li> Excellent toorhbrush! Has made a difference in dental checkups...reduces deth of pockets in gumline.</li>
    <li> I never do reviews, I ordered two emmi dent ultrasonic brushes on December 16, 2014. I gave one for a Christmas gift and kept one for myself which I did not open until after Christmas as not to spoil the gift I had for my husband.I used the product for three days and was very happy with it, actually I loved it until it stopped working, The on/ off button no longer turns the unit on. Of course I was disappointed but was confident that Ora tec would send me a new unit. I contacted Amazon and was told by them I would be contacted by Ora tec with in two days, that did not happen even with multiple emails and phone calls I have had absolutely no response. Bottom line, customer service sucks! It does not matter how much I love the product if it doesn&#x27;t work. Sooooo frustrating!</li>
    <li> noticing a deeper cleaning already</li>
    <li> I do not like toothpaste but with this product you use so very little I don&#x27;t mind it.  Also, even though I don&#x27;t have to brush,  my teeth feel just like I came from the Dentists office...everyday!</li>
    <li> This is the same review that I wrote for this same toothbrush except that this actual order of mine included the TheraSol rinse option, which is refreshing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Emmi-dent ultrasonic toothbrush for several weeks has definitely improved my gum health. My dentist confirmed that they are a healthy pink color now and do not bleed like before. My teeth also seem to be whiter. However one thing the ultrasonic brush cannot do is heal 6-mm pockets (in only three weeks, anyway); root scaling may be needed for that. I found that the small vibration of the handle is not a problem or a tickling annoyance as I feared it might be. It might even be useful beyond confirming that the brush is working. That is, the gentle physical vibration may help dislodge plaque from the teeth after it has been loosened by the ultrasound which is not detectable. It is nice to let the brush do all the work while I admire the potted plant on the window sill. The cost of the special nanobubble toothpaste is not a problem either since the amount necessary to work up a foam is extremely small, less than the size of a pea, more like the size of a BB. I trust German or Swiss engineering to be correct about the need for the nanobubble toothpaste. I like the convenience of the charger stand which does not require any switches to be flipped; simply set the toothbrush handle on the inductive charger post; a red led turns on to show that the toothbrush is charging, that is all there is to it.</li>
    <li> i had severe gum infection and after using this product for two weeks i went back to the dentist and he said there was great improvement and infection was almost completely cleared up.  i love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have flossed, used a WaterPik, and a SoniCare toothbrush twice a day for many many years. Then my daughter read about this ultrasound toothbrush in the Reader&#x27;s Digest. I looked for reviews on the internet and every one that I found was positive. I unfortunately had to have many of my teeth capped as a teenager due to damage to my tooth enamel. Keeping my gums healthy with so many crowns has always been quite a struggle. I have only used the Emmi-Dent for two days, but already I feel a dramatic improvement. My teeth feel smooth like they do after a professional cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office. When I wake up in the morning my mouth still feels just as fresh as it did right after I cleaned my teeth before retiring the night before. I am using the NanoPaste and the Therasol. I highly recommend this product. I hope it lasts a long time because I will be using it at least twice a day.</li>
