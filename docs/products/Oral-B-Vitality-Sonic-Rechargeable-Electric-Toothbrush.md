### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is the best.</li>
      <li>My hygienist recommended it s the best</li>
      <li>Fair product rates 2+ @ best.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still happy.</li>
      <li>The price was great.  </li>
      <li>Great price, shipped</li>
      <li>The timer is also a great feature.</li>
      <li>It seems to work great to me.</li>
      <li>The battery life is great, and this brush helps me to not brush my teeth so vigorously (which I am prone to do with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; brush).  </li>
      <li>However, battery and everything else is working great</li>
      <li>The oral-B Vitality Sonic toothbrush works great and is an improvement on the rotating head technology.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has one of those in her dorm, but when she comes home from college - this is a great toothbrush to utilize.</li>
      <li>Couple that with a very nice design, rechargeable battery, two year warranty, and a one year \\&quot;satisfaction\\&quot; guarantee, and you see that this is a great buy.</li>
      <li>HUGE DIFFERENCE!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure my dentist is happy about this.!!!</li>
      <li>Most of my family have been using this toothbrush (the sonic variety of the oral-b vitality) for about a year, &amp; we&#x27;re very happy w/ it.  </li>
      <li>Good product, great service.</li>
      <li>It is good quality for the price, and he was happy with it.</li>
      <li>I had good luck with a precision toothbrush from Oral B</li>
      <li>This sonic is not so forceful, so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
      <li>Perfect amount of power and the built in timer helps to keep me brushing for the full two minutes.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t dispute that, but for a person trying out an electric toothbrush or just wanting something better than their manual, this one works great.</li>
      <li>Excellent service, very fast response.</li>
      <li>I love the way this toothbrush vibrates!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Its priced nice but, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it..</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s not as good as the 5500, it&#x27;s EXPONENTIALLY better than this vibrating stick.</li>
      <li>Good product, don&#x27;t expect magic, just a tooth brush that vibrate so it helps messaging your gum, that&#x27;s all.</li>
      <li>and i have to say i am pretty happy with the result.</li>
      <li>All it does it vibrate...and a very light vibration at that.</li>
      <li>The Vitality does a very good job for the money, and it gets your teeth far cleaner than manual brushing ever could.</li>
      <li>I have had it for more than one year now</li>
      <li>But, for the under $20 price tag, I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied with this product, maybe if I had a thicker wallet I could buy something more pricey...</li>
      <li>:)       </li>
      <li>Chose the Sonicare Xtreme and satisfied with that.</li>
      <li>I also use the Rotadent, which is better than any Sonic in my opinion.</li>
      <li>if you want a sonic technology you are better off getting $100 SONIC toothbrush.</li>
      <li>My husband and I love it.</li>
      <li>you want a sonic brush, spend more money than this.</li>
      <li>We have a Sonic Brand one that we like better though.</li>
      <li>HOW MUCH BETTER SONICARE IS.</li>
      <li>I simply love it.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, I will be able to return this product.</li>
      <li>Okay is that 20 words??</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t doubt that it works better.  </li>
      <li>This does nothing more than vibrate.  </li>
      <li>I have a battery operated cheaper one that has much more power.  </li>
      <li>so I am pleased with the brush.</li>
      <li>The two minute silent sensor is great, because it counts my brushing time for me!  </li>
      <li>This is not \\&quot;ultra sonic\\&quot; more like \\&quot;ultra weak\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>The 1/3 speed difference evidently is very significant in the ability of the brush to get the ol chompers</li>
      <li>It does take a full two minutes for my teeth to feel really clean, but once you get used to that fact, it does a good job.</li>
      <li>I found it did an excellent job of keeping my teeth clean and white between dentist office visits.      </li>
      <li>I went out and bought a higher priced Oral B and am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with this product and my first try at electronic toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>I have had this toothbrush for 4 years now, and I just purchased a replacement because my original isn&#x27;t holding a charge for more than maybe 2 days now.</li>
      <li>I have used other electric tooth brushes and like the Oral-B brushes the best.  </li>
      <li>It massages the gums and teeth  nicely as I brush, giving my mouth a nice tingly clean vibrant feeling afterwards.  </li>
      <li>But the main reason I wanted this is good sonic power.  </li>
      <li>This process is gentle, effective, and leaves the teeth feeling and looking very clean.</li>
      <li>Make sure you charge it a full 24 hours before using.   </li>
      <li>The product was fine.</li>
      <li>Never again will I buy another $100 tooth brush when this is available.</li>
      <li>only quibble is that I&#x27;ll need to replace the head more often than my manual toothbrush, but given the more effective brushing it probably balances out.</li>
      <li>The brush has a comfortable grip and is lightweight, but so is a $2.10 OralB manual toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I enjoy brushing my teeth and look forward to it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Curious about the Oral-B&#x27;s non-effectiveness, I held the bristles lightly against my tongue, and could feel no motion</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used all of the sonic toothbrushs on the market and Braun Sonic Complete is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>Price for refills of the head is pretty pricey not to be completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>It has been my first sonic toothbrush, so I might not be the most knowledgeable person in this area, but here we go.    </li>
      <li>and I am happy to use this because it leaves my teeth feeling clean and far much better than my old one.</li>
      <li>i brush around 3-4 mins and it feels clean</li>
      <li>Gave it to my 7y dtr, and she DOESN&#x27;T get her teeth clean either, so bought a manual tooth brush to get them clean.</li>
      <li>and oh yes, clean teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t as good as a SonicCare, or one of the other brands that cost upwards of $100.  </li>
      <li>The brush itself isn&#x27;t all that special.</li>
      <li>and she was right!</li>
      <li>since i own other oral-b oscillating toothbrushes and there were pretty good the scrubbing teeth.</li>
      <li>works fine and gives you a bright white smile.</li>
      <li>Even on a full charge, this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t manage the side-to-side sweeping motion shown on the package.</li>
      <li>Its power is outstanding and it recharges in a fairly reasonable time.</li>
      <li>I bought this brush at my CVS a while back, and it seemed like a good deal...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the dual head Oral-B Vitality toothbrush and was very happy with it because the bristles actually move and your mouth feels extra clean.</li>
      <li>It is also interesting how many people expect to get the same level of cleaning out of this item as ones costing three or four times as much.</li>
      <li>I completely disagree with the reviewers who say that it doesn&#x27;t perform better than the non-sonic brushes.    </li>
      <li>Still, it is worth every penny, since now</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is by far better than a toothbrush powered by batteries.</li>
      <li>It really vibrates amazingly well compared to the old one?</li>
      <li>It buzzed but never seemed to clean better than a regular toothbrush and then broke after 3 months.</li>
      <li>Oral B has their own latecomer Sonic Complete model (which costs about $100) and a number of lower cost designs that use a more conventional oscillating mechanical head to clean</li>
      <li>And it really works to clean your teeth.  </li>
      <li>the sonic toothbrush does not seem to move much, i think, how could it clean my teeth.</li>
      <li>Your mouth and your teeth really feel clean after using this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend thought that the old version is so strong and powerful that there&#x27;s a chance it could loosen fillings,</li>
      <li>My teeth are cleaner, my gums don&#x27;t bleed, and it&#x27;s much easier to brush for the full 2 minutes each time.  </li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t afford a good sonicare, the xtreme3000 sells for less than 30 bucks at Wal*mart, and it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>I have to say that this such a great improvement over using a regular toothbrush.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product was what I expected but I had to return it within 30 days timeframe due to it being a gift which wasn&#x27;t wanted. Still waiting for the credit to be applied to my credit card and it&#x27;s been 7 weeks since I returned the items.  Don&#x27;t plan on getting your money back if you have to return the item.</li>
    <li> After using a normal 2-speed electric toothbrush I tried this one and at first I could not understand what was wrong with it. I thought that it was defective. But soon I realized that its vibrating speed is simply not enough to be of any practical use. It&#x27;s a mystery to me why to design and make a product that is useless. Unfortunately, as far as electric toothbrushes are concerned, price does matter.</li>
    <li> Although the package of the Toothbrush was sealed, the brush head looked so much like it&#x27;s been used for period of time. Due to the price of the the brush $13-$14, I didn&#x27;t bother to return it. It&#x27;s still sitting there for getting dust.</li>
    <li> This does nothing more than vibrate.  I wanted to try a different electric brush and this is not the one I would recommend.  It was just like using a manuel</li>
    <li> I bought one entirely because it was significantly less expensive than a Sonicare.  I have had it three years and have yet to be able to run the battery down, which I find remarkable ... leaving it off the charger for a week results in very little if any loss of power.    I completely disagree with the reviewers who say that it doesn&#x27;t perform better than the non-sonic brushes.    The first time I went to my dentist after having used it for six months, he sat back in his chair and asked me what I was doing differently.  I told him nothing but changing to a sonic toothbrush ... when he asked me what brand it was, I told him and he said \\&quot;Well, don&#x27;t change a thing, because this is the first time you&#x27;ve had zero placque.\\&quot;    Its not supposed to be a substitute for flossing.  Flossing once a week (which is considerably less than what the dentist wants) and using this brush have improved my dental health measurably enough that my dentist remarked on it, and I doubt you can do better than that for the money.</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst electric toothbrush I have ever had. All it does it vibrate...and a very light vibration at that. I purchased this product because I thought it would do what my old brand would do; unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t even close. Horrible product. Spend the extra 5 bucks to buy one that actually works. Trying to save $5 bucks has cost me almost $60 to get exactly what I wanted out of an electric toothbrush. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> It seems to work great to me. Some people say that that you can tell the difference when you buy a $100 brush...but who would pay that much for a toothbrush?  Main point....it works.</li>
    <li> The product was fine. But the shipper was sooooo slow that it did not come in time for Christmas. It came the day after Christmas when it was ordered on the 17th. I was assured it would arrive on time. I had no gift for that Family member. On top of that, Amazon being the good Company they are felt so bad. Sent me another one within two business days and now I am stuck with two and had to pay for two when I only wanted one!!!!!!! Definetly not happy.</li>
    <li> I bought these toothbrushes for my kids at Christmas and since I ordered them early and I didn&#x27;t see the brushes until the other day - it was too late to return them.  I am totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last 2 years, I found it better than brushing by hand.  And, brush is very long lasting(over a year for me).</li>
    <li> This is a very good alternative for those expensive toothbrushes that on a market. My daughter has one of those in her dorm, but when she comes home from college - this is a great toothbrush to utilize.</li>
    <li> The oral-B Vitality Sonic toothbrush works great and is an improvement on the rotating head technology.  My kids abuse this toothbrush daily and it holds up very well.  The water tight design is especially useful for enduring the abuse of a small child.  The two minutes timer keeps my kids from quitting early.  I recommend it.  :)       [[ASIN:B000GBID20 Oral-B Vitality Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected but it works fine this vibrates instead of spinning around but it does the job</li>
    <li> Even on a full charge, this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t manage the side-to-side sweeping motion shown on the package. Rather, it vibrates. And the vibrations would be nearly imperceptible were it not for the accompanying buzzing sound. The only upside is I get to use a word that I seldom find use for: effete - describes it quite well. Spend your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This brush has a brain. It tells you by vibration when you&#x27;ve brushed for 2 minutes. My husband and I love it.</li>
    <li> It works great....never used a sonic b4.  I&#x27;m sure my dentist is happy about this.!!!</li>
    <li> Fair product rates 2+ @ best.  Its priced nice but, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it..its too soft to get teeth properly clean from experience w/ it.  Normally a fan of &#x27;soft toothbrushes&#x27; but not this one. Guess &#x27;I got what I paid for with this one&#x27;.  Gave it to my 7y dtr, and she DOESN&#x27;T get her teeth clean either, so bought a manual tooth brush to get them clean. Brush is soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt her mouth though.  Sorry, wish I could have left a better review, suggest another brand.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush pretty much just vibrates.  You still have to do all the \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; yourself.  But, I think the vibration does help to loosen whatever is on my teeth, so it&#x27;s still better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great price, shipped fast.&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping it would replace my old oral-b rechargeable, but the company does not make that brush head type any more.&lt;br /&gt;Got this because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Is ok, but definitely not great like the old one.&lt;br /&gt;I actually think the manual, old fashion toothbrush from Oral-B is better.&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes it though, as he has sensitive teeth and the very gently action does not bother him.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is low powered (no sonic power here.)  I have a battery operated cheaper one that has much more power.  Oh well, I learned not to try something like this through mail order.</li>
    <li> Most of my family have been using this toothbrush (the sonic variety of the oral-b vitality) for about a year, &amp; we&#x27;re very happy w/ it.  &amp; so is my dental hygienist...I missed my last appointment, so it&#x27;s been 18 months between cleanings, &amp; there was very little build-up.  the replacement heads are a bit hard to find &amp; a bit pricey, but I found some on Amazon for about $16 for a 3-pk, which is about 2/3 the price elsewhere.  So I purchased this one at Amazon for my son.</li>
    <li> I have used sonic type-tooth brushes for nearly 20 years.  Every couple years my expensive Oral B&#x27;s have died and I&#x27;ve paid another $100 or more for a replacement.  This tooth brush does an amazing job and works as well as the expensive brands.  I like it&#x27;s lighter weight and smaller head size.  I&#x27;ll continue buying this brush, if and whenever it dies.  Never again will I buy another $100 tooth brush when this is available.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something less abrasive than a regular manual toothbrush as I tend to be an agressive brusher.  I was very pleased with this product and my first try at electronic toothbrushes.  It is compact and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it holding a charge.  Refills are a bit expensive but the same is the case for all sonic refills across the board.</li>
    <li> Good product, don&#x27;t expect magic, just a tooth brush that vibrate so it helps messaging your gum, that&#x27;s all. for the price, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the smallest sonic/electric brush I could find.  Compared to a manual brush, it does much better, and compared to a typical Sonic, it is much smaller.    I need it for travel. I also use the Rotadent, which is better than any Sonic in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M GIVING IT AS A CHRISTMJAS PRESENT, BUT I&#x27;VE HAD ONE BEFORE, THAT&#x27;S WHY I BOUGHT IT FOR MY FIANCE.</li>
    <li> I complete disagree with the previous review on that Sonicare is superior.  I&#x27;ve used all of the sonic toothbrushs on the market and Braun Sonic Complete is by far the best.  However, this unit is NOTHING like Sonic Complete, the sonic energy is completely in the handle, it&#x27;s like holding a vibrator.  The real Sonic Complete channels the energy to the brush head...  You are probably better off with one of the other two models of Vitality that uses rotational brush heads.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The price was great.  I&#x27;ve had others that have cost much more and have not liked as well.</li>
    <li> Go to your local CVS or another drug store and look at the  other electric toothbrushes. They are under $8, $7, and this   includes a charger. A new type of charger. That&#x27;s it.  I was looking for the metal contacts from the charger to the   bottom of the Oral B.   But the main reason I wanted this is good sonic power.  Didn&#x27;t get it here. Chose the Sonicare Xtreme and satisfied with that.</li>
    <li> You use this like your normal brush, did not see much difference.  It just vibtates and does not seem to be of much use.  I will probably go for a better model next time.</li>
    <li> My expectation were low for this inexpensive sonic toothbrush, they should have been lower.  Not much sonic or movement of any kind. The brush has a comfortable grip and is lightweight, but so is a $2.10 OralB manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> i agree with the above reviewer. if you want a sonic technology you are better off getting $100 SONIC toothbrush. i have used couple of oral b toothbrushes. that include the double spinning one and cross action, the problem i always had was the battery they would not last long. now i don&#x27;t seem to have problem with this one because i just brush and it goes right back to my charger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i have been using oral b vitality for a month and i have to say i am pretty happy with the result. i brush around 3-4 mins and it feels clean and i could tell the difference b/w the ordinary toothbrushes and the alkaline battery powered onces. even though it will obviously not give you the same sonic technology for $20, i think for me it is worth to spend couple of extra dollars and get better cleaning than ordinary toothbrushes.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> What can you say about a new toothbrush? It really vibrates amazingly well compared to the old one? It&#x27;s a nice blue and white? It works if you use it regularly? Okay is that 20 words?? Buy it, use it you won&#x27;t be disappointed and oh yes, clean teeth.</li>
    <li> Excellent service, very fast response. I am still getting used to the Sonic part, but all in all I like it. Good product, great service.</li>
    <li> My dentist said I should switch from the elec toothbrush I was using b/c it was too forceful and was pushing the gums back from the teeth.  This sonic is not so forceful, so that&#x27;s good.  It does take a full two minutes for my teeth to feel really clean, but once you get used to that fact, it does a good job.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers have said that the $100 one is better.  I won&#x27;t dispute that, but for a person trying out an electric toothbrush or just wanting something better than their manual, this one works great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As background, I have had problems with my teeth for years; if the plaque builds up, my gums bleed when I brush my teeth.  So I got this electric toothbrush.  It works.  My teeth are cleaner, my gums don&#x27;t bleed, and it&#x27;s much easier to brush for the full 2 minutes each time.  (I also like the way the bristles change color to tell you when the head needs to be replaced.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only quibble is that I&#x27;ll need to replace the head more often than my manual toothbrush, but given the more effective brushing it probably balances out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sure, I could buy the expensive one.  I don&#x27;t doubt that it works better.  But for people who *don&#x27;t* have $100+ to throw on a new toothbrush, this is a very viable alternative.</li>
    <li> I can not compare this one to a more expensive model or different model because I have not used them.  I have used other electric tooth brushes and like the Oral-B brushes the best.  I am confident the results of this sonic brush is at least as good as the regular electric brushes.  My dental hygenist compliments the condition of my teeth so I am pleased with the brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 220 Volt model overseas and like that one very well.  This led me to purchase the 110 Volt model for use in the USA.  The action of the 110V model is very sluggish compared to the overseas purchase.  I would not re-purchase this one again, but I won&#x27;t quit using it either.  Price for refills of the head is pretty pricey not to be completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband, who will only use a sonic toothbrush.  It is good quality for the price, and he was happy with it.</li>
    <li> It has been my first sonic toothbrush, so I might not be the most knowledgeable person in this area, but here we go.    For me it doesn´t seem to do much, just vibrates with moderate power.  However, battery and everything else is working great</li>
    <li> When I try out a new electric toothbrush, I test it by using disclosing tablets. Using them, you can see the plaque on your teeth, and measure how much your brush leaves behind. This brush removed absolutely nothing. It&#x27;s exactly like a standard manual toothbrush that buzzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on sonic toothbrushes vibrate in an up and down motion at high speed. They don&#x27;t move far, but the speed they&#x27;re traveling at allows them to scrub the surfaces of your teeth very efficiently. My old Sonicare (purchased before Philips bought them out) left NO plaque film behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curious about the Oral-B&#x27;s non-effectiveness, I held the bristles lightly against my tongue, and could feel no motion whatever. It&#x27;s as though the handle vibrates, but the bristles remain stationary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the brush is inexpensive, so I won&#x27;t feel too bad about throwing it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Your mouth and your teeth really feel clean after using this toothbrush.  And it really works to clean your teeth.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> I used to use the standard Oral B electric toothbrush.  I found it did an excellent job of keeping my teeth clean and white between dentist office visits.      When I first used the Sonic, I was quite surprised that the bristles did not rotate like they did on my old toothbrush.  They simply vibrate.  My initial impression was that this toothbrush wasn&#x27;t going to &#x27;power-wash&#x27; my teeth like the last one, but perhaps this is a good thing?  My boyfriend thought that the old version is so strong and powerful that there&#x27;s a chance it could loosen fillings, etc.  That&#x27;s not so much a concern for me because as of yet, I don&#x27;t have fillings, but for people who do, you might want to get the Sonic version as opposed to the regular Vitality or other non-sonic brushes.</li>
    <li> I have had the Oral-B sonic complete toothbrush for the last two years. I saw this and decided to try it, looking for a smaller, more portable alternative for travel. I was extremely disappointed. This toothbrush is only slightly better than old-school manual toothbrushes. No better than the disposable electric toothbrushes. This is not \\&quot;ultra sonic\\&quot; more like \\&quot;ultra weak\\&quot;. If anyone with the sonic complete is thinking of this, it feels as if you&#x27;re using the low or \\&quot;massage\\&quot; setting.Seriously though, i know it is probably not fair to compare it to the Sonic Complete which is 3-4x more expensive. But this brush is 1/3-1/4 the strength. The reason i bought it even though i had reservations about \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; is that since the Sonic complete is 2-3 years old, and Oral-B had come out with several other high end toothbrushes, that maybe the cost of technology had come down.    I&#x27;d pass on this if i were to do it over.</li>
    <li> I am surprised by the number of negative reviews for the Vitality Sonic. It seems a large number of people do not get the concept. Sonic toothbrushes are not the same thing as mechanical brushes where you just hold the handle and your teeth get brushed by some sort of wiggling/rotating mechanism. With a sonic brush you have to move your hands just like with a regular brush, only your teeth get a lot cleaner because of the ultrasonic vibrations. It is also interesting how many people expect to get the same level of cleaning out of this item as ones costing three or four times as much. That is clearly unreasonable. The Vitality does a very good job for the money, and it gets your teeth far cleaner than manual brushing ever could. Couple that with a very nice design, rechargeable battery, two year warranty, and a one year \\&quot;satisfaction\\&quot; guarantee, and you see that this is a great buy. Not to mention that this brush is a high quality item made in Germany, not China.</li>
    <li> i picked this sonic toothbrush from local brooks. just for the curiosity. it is very cheap compare to other sonic toothbrush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;it felt strange at first. since i own other oral-b oscillating toothbrushes and there were pretty good the scrubbing teeth. the sonic toothbrush does not seem to move much, i think, how could it clean my teeth. after a couple days, it start to think of it as a manual toothbrush, i used it scrubbing back and forth at my teeth... and it felt very c l e a n afterward.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the trick is to think of it as regular toothbrush. move it back at forth, gently and lightly. i use this in conjunction with waterpik and my teeth felt like i just saw a dental hygienist getting my teeth cleaned. it is far superior than the oscillating type, even the expensive ones. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the battery does not last very long. so you have to travel with the charger. but you can&#x27;t beat the price at this quality. - 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This product attempts to bring sonic toothbrush technology to the sub-$20 price bracket. It does not entirely suceed, and though nicely designed, it is not very effective at its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonic toothbrush as invented by Philips uses a high speed pulsing (&gt; 30,000 rpm) to use fluid below the gumline to help vibrate dirt and plack off the teeth. This process is gentle, effective, and leaves the teeth feeling and looking very clean. I&#x27;ve used these brushes and they are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this marvel is that Philips charges roughly $80-$130 for their Sonicare brushes. Oral B has their own latecomer Sonic Complete model (which costs about $100) and a number of lower cost designs that use a more conventional oscillating mechanical head to clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem here is the corners Oral B cut to bring you a $20 sonic brush. The brush vibrates at a much lower speed (20,000 rpm) and though it uses the same brush head as the more expensive Sonic Complete, it does not clean teeth anywhere near as well as a faster sonic brush. The 1/3 speed difference evidently is very significant in the ability of the brush to get the ol chompers clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a sonic brush, spend more money than this. If you want a cheaper brush that is fairly effective at cleaning your teeth, try the Oral B Vitality Dual Action ($18) or the Oral B Cross Action Power Max ($12).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dual power head action of these designs, though not sonic, is a reasonable compromise in getting teeth clean while also keeping price low. The Vitality Sonic just spins its wheels without doing much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design and function of the Vitality Sonic is ergonomic and reasonably high quality, but for a low cost cleaning solution, buy something else, and if you want the high-tech sonic experience, then spend more.</li>
    <li> For a fairly inexpensive battery operated tooth brush, it isn&#x27;t bad.  We have a Sonic Brand one that we like better though.</li>
    <li> I have used the regular oral B vitality toothbrush with the smaller round head for a couple of years now.  I had to replace it and decided on the sonic version.  I like the bigger head but had to get use to it again.  works fine and gives you a bright white smile.</li>
    <li> I can pretty much never find brush heads for this model. I know I can get them online but having to wait for stuff to be delivered is not always convenient. The brush itself isn&#x27;t all that special. I&#x27;ve owned this for 2 years and the vibration is starting to spazz out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the dual head Oral-B Vitality toothbrush and was very happy with it because the bristles actually move and your mouth feels extra clean. THIS \\&quot;Sonic\\&quot; toothbrush is a sham!  The bristle don&#x27;t move!! The entire toothbrush merely vibrates which is probably what causes the 20,000 \\&quot;movements\\&quot; per minute.  Very very disappointed...don&#x27;t waste your money on this, I recommend the Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush instead.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is by far better than a toothbrush powered by batteries. Its power is outstanding and it recharges in a fairly reasonable time. I have had it for more than one year now and it is operating as new.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is the best. My hygienist recommended it s the best and she was right! I&#x27;ve been using it for couple of years and I&#x27;m still happy. Perfect amount of power and the built in timer helps to keep me brushing for the full two minutes. My kids and wife also like this model. My only complaint is that the replacement heads are expensive.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is not effective in cleaning your teeth unless you use it like a regular toothbrush and do all the work.&lt;br /&gt;The brush doesn&#x27;t rotate it only vibrates.  I found it worthless and not worth the money.  Don&#x27;t be fooled into buying it!</li>
    <li> I had good luck with a precision toothbrush from Oral B so I got the vitality sonic. It buzzed but never seemed to clean better than a regular toothbrush and then broke after 3 months. Stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I plugged it in and let it fully charge.  It didn&#x27;t work at all  :(  Hopefully, I will be able to return this product.</li>
    <li> Item not working correctly out of the Box.  Hard to find out how to warranty it.  Totally unhappy, Just looking around Amazon on how to warranty to difficult.  Would not buy this way again.</li>
    <li> This is hardly just a vibrating manual toothbrush. After using it my gums sting and tingle for a minute, so it must be doing something.  The rotating brush toothbrushes don&#x27;t create that effect. The timer is also a great feature. The charger does not make a direct connection with the brush; it must be capacitively coupled AC that is converted to DC inside the brush. I haven&#x27;t used the more expensive models, but this is heads above anything I have used before; and I guess that&#x27;s the point. I would never have considered spending $100 on a toothbrush, and I&#x27;m sure there are many other consumers who feel the same way.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this such a great improvement over using a regular toothbrush.  I love the way this toothbrush vibrates!  It massages the gums and teeth  nicely as I brush, giving my mouth a nice tingly clean vibrant feeling afterwards.  The two minute silent sensor is great, because it counts my brushing time for me!  This unit is cordless, which is a big plus. Make sure you charge it a full 24 hours before using.   Replacement brushheads are a bit expensive, but I guess that&#x27;s why this toothbrush is nicely priced -- they make money off the replacement brusheads which last at least 3 months.  Still, it is worth every penny, since now I enjoy brushing my teeth and look forward to it.  I have bought a few for family and friends as well.</li>
    <li> It vibrates like a massage mode of Sonic Complete. You&#x27;ll get less than what you pay. You should brush hard even while it is vibrating.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my Mother and I already had been using for about a month.  Product arrived on time and she loves it.  Brush gets all the way to back molars and cleans them well.  Pulse interruption lets you no when you have brushed enough.  I try to use morning and evening.  No problems and would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for 4 years now, and I just purchased a replacement because my original isn&#x27;t holding a charge for more than maybe 2 days now. This is the only sonic toothbrush I have owned, and I see where there are more powerful/costly products out there....I figured I would stick with what works for me and I have no regrets. It fits my hand comfortably, it cleans my teeth very well with using the usual up-down motion as manual brushing---old habits die hard. It is quieter than some electronic brushes, and my teeth aren&#x27;t being rattled out of my head. I also like that the head is a smaller size, the larger heads don&#x27;t work well for me. The only problem is looking for replacement heads, they can be hard to find. I am satisfied with this product, maybe if I had a thicker wallet I could buy something more pricey...this beats manual brushing by a mile!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush at my CVS a while back, and it seemed like a good deal...16 bucks for a \\&quot;sonic toothbrush.\\&quot; I figured the bristles didn&#x27;t move too much because it WAS sonic, and it didn&#x27;t seem too bad. I just kind of settled for it since I&#x27;d never really used a sonic toothbrush before. However, i just recently picked up 2 new Sonicares. A 5500 for my mom as a gift, and an xtreme3000 for myself. HUGE DIFFERENCE!!! This is the feeling eveyone has been talking about! A real sonic toothbrush. I went back to check out my old Vitality and it felt like someone taped a toothbrush to a vibrating pager. THATS HOW MUCH BETTER SONICARE IS. If you can&#x27;t afford a good sonicare, the xtreme3000 sells for less than 30 bucks at Wal*mart, and it gets the job done. Even though it&#x27;s not as good as the 5500, it&#x27;s EXPONENTIALLY better than this vibrating stick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t as good as a SonicCare, or one of the other brands that cost upwards of $100.  But, for the under $20 price tag, I love it.  The battery life is great, and this brush helps me to not brush my teeth so vigorously (which I am prone to do with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; brush).  I love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace my old electric toothbrush which had served me long and well.  I found this to be very disappointing.  All it did was vibrate.  There was no other movement.  It was like a manual toothbrush with a nervous condition.  I should have known from the price that I would be disappointed.  I went out and bought a higher priced Oral B and am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This brush hurts my gums and does not do a very good job of cleaning in tight places between round shaped teeth.  I use a water-pik, which helps a lot, but always have to check again for plaque that the brush misses.  It is very hard, and I worry that it is damaging enamel.  Will replace it very soon.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to the regular toothbrush and I was not disappointed. I simply love it. This is my first electric toothbrush and I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to normal brushing now. I am very protective of my teeth and I am happy to use this because it leaves my teeth feeling clean and far much better than my old one. I would recommend this.</li>
