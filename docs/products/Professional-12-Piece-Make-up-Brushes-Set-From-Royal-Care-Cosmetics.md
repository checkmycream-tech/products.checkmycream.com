<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the brushes, they are cheap and nice quality. The shipment was fast. When I opened the package the brushes smell like plastic but after i washed them the smell went away. If you are a beginner at make up the brushes are great to start.one if then only shed at first but not any more.am really happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I know, I know, you get what you pay for but these were not even worth the $14 I paid for them. I don&#x27;t know that the smell is that bad- you&#x27;re supposed to wash them before using anyway. My biggest issue is the shedding. And they started shedding right away. When I washed them it got worse. I was hopeful that after the wash they would stop shedding....no such luck.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes to anyone. I&#x27;ve bought other inexpensive brushes from relatively unknown brands and have been satisfied but these are simply a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;The stippling brush and white contour/blush brush attracted me to this set but I think you&#x27;re better off investing a little more and buying something else.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped :)</li>
    <li> Good brushes work well very sturdy sheds a little wich is expected of any brushes they r a little long but I like that I wish the smsll white blending brush hsd more bristles yet its s good set I would recamend these brushes 2 u guys and shipping was super fast I recieved them in two days</li>
    <li> these are my first set of brushes so i cant compare them to any other. however i like them alot, they work just fine</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first about buying makeup brushes online but i am love with my make up brushes from royal care cosmetics!!!! wonderful brushes</li>
    <li> This was shipped incredibly fast and yes the marker scent was noticeable but it goes away after a good washing. The eye brushes aren&#x27;t as great as I wish they were. I only use one the angled somewhat fluffy one. But the biggest face brush is the perfect blush brush for my face as I have a large cheek area. I also really like the white angled brush for contouring. I use the larger concealer brush for my paint pots and its really awesome for washes of color. The rest of the eye brushes don&#x27;t hold any pigment and are scratchy to use. I have this 4 starts because the brushes I do use I use them everyday and will continue to use them! And the sipping was so so so fast!!!</li>
    <li> My dad purchased these brushes for me and I was so happy to receive them. The overall quality of the brushes is ok. Shedding is minimal to none. in fact the only shedding is from the large powder brush, the blending brush and the white hair angled brush. the other brushes are good. The handle of the large powder brush and the stipling brush broke off after washing them a few times. The stippling brush I still use though because it works well even without the handle. the brush i hate the most is the angled blush brush. To be frank it stinks and it is very scratchy! I guess its because it was made of some kinda goat hair. I tried getting rid of the scent by bleaching the brush and my oh my the hairs literally melted away! DO NOT PUT BLEACH ON THE BRUSHES WITH WHITE HAIR! Other than those issues the brushes are fine. I love the eyeshadow brushes and the double ended foundation n concealer brush is very very durable.</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price! I love the powder one. The eyeliner one is too soft for my taste but works great with eyeshadow! And it ships very fast</li>
    <li> I had the sigma essentials kit and I was absolutely not happy about it, especially for $140.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are definitely comparable. however, i am going to throw out the powder and the contour brush because they smell very strongly like formaldehyde and shed like crazy. Also, i washed them once and they both lost their shape. i am also going to throw out the small blending brush because it has no shape as well.&lt;br /&gt;the eyeshadow brushes are great, though, especially for the price, they are softer than the eyeshadow brushes that came in the sigma set. however, the types of brushes are not unique, the angled eyeliner brush is way too big (at least to use it as an eyeliner brush)and the blending brush is just ok. overall, i got 10 brushes for $16 which a great deal. The stippling brush is great. I also ordered the cup holder case which is great, it&#x27;s the same as the sigma one just half the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my kit &amp; I am in love, so I had to order myself some! They are sooo soft, probably some of the softest brushes I&#x27;ve owned. Shipping was fast so that&#x27;s always a plus. Only thing I wasn&#x27;t happy with was packaging, they were wrapped in bubble wrap and shoved in an envelope. Other than that I love these brushes!!</li>
    <li> i like my brushes... the white brush and the large blending brush sheds but besides that ... i love them... I added glitter to the bottom to make them fancy but overall I&#x27;m happy with them</li>
    <li> The best are pretty good for the price. I did notice some shedding from the angled face brush which why I only gave 3 stars. I must say I love my real techniques brushes a little better.</li>
    <li> love the different kinds of brushes and what all you can do with it.  I just started doing my makeup and i love it</li>
    <li> I was very happy to see such a good price and okay reviews on a full brush set. I am happy I purchased the set, but I am very disappointed in the all white synthetic brushes and the big black powder brush because if dramatic shedding and a strong odor. Otherwise I have nothing to complain about, the other brushes do what their supposed to do. If looking for a affordable set to get you through then its perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI if I were to purchase this set, I would also recommend buying the kambuki set as well if you want great face brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madi, mua xx</li>
    <li> very satisfied brushes where good condition only thing as usual u have the wash brand new brushes  and they where soft enough</li>
    <li> Not as soft as other low priced brushes..blending brush is huge and pokey I could do with out this brush set</li>
    <li> http://youtu.be/65xse6FXEE8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for watching my review of the Royal Care Cosmetics 12 Piece Makeup Brush Set! Here are my honest thoughts about this product, the price, the quality/quantity, utility and overall performance. Hope it helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/65xse6FXEE8</li>
    <li> My daughter (17) loves these brushes...the are great quality for the price</li>
    <li> i am so flabbergasted, with these brushes there amazing. They are almost the same as MAC brushes but cheaper. the only brush i didn&#x27;t like was the power brush it was not the best. but other then that i loved them and for the price I paid them for, they were worth it. :)</li>
    <li> one brush was kind of damage, but I love them all</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes is truly amazing considering the price. All of the brushes are able to pick up and apply product just as good as high end brushes. The only problem I had with these brushes was that some (particularly the larger brushes) hairs would easily fall off while applying a product to my face. This wouldn&#x27;t be that big of a problem if it weren&#x27;t so difficult to get the hairs off afterward, since most liquid products tend to be somewhat sticky. They do a wonderful job of transferring cosmetics on to the skin but once you&#x27;re finished, you might end up with a few noticable hairs that fall out of the brush.</li>
    <li> Nice brush set. None of the brushes shed and they are still intact. I&#x27;m a little concerned because everytime I wash the large face brush it bleeds black dye so I try not to use too often but the other brushes are fine. I would recommend this set.</li>
    <li> When I received brushes I was very excited to use them. As routine I wash all new brushes before use. OMG why did I do that, the brushes texture changed. They also began to shed. I tried to use to apply makeup but I would have the hairs from brushes all over face. This purchase was&lt;br /&gt;A bust! And ... I used Macs professional brush cleaner just in case your wondering what Not to use! I&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars Bc it does ship really fast!</li>
    <li> Delivery was very quick. Looking forward to using the brushes as they were highly recommended.  Yes, there is an odor when you first open the package, so wash before using.  Otherwise i am really happy with these brushes, good value.</li>
    <li> This product in short was fine but after having used natural hair cosmetic brushes for over 30 years, I prefer natural hair over synthetic for its blendablity in application of facial makeup.  See my reviews for other synthetic brushes I have bought Gold Premium Royal Care Cosmetic Brushes in my reviews that wil provide you with more details.</li>
    <li> Love these - will definitely buy them again for family and friends.  It would be a bonus to have a case included, but it doesn&#x27;t stop me from purchasing them again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these, not only do they blend beautifully  I got them in like 3 days tops no long waits I would seriously recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I never have purchased a set of brushes before.  However, UTube suggested this brand and I&#x27;m glad I listened.  I have been using and cleansing them daily absolutely no shedding.  It&#x27;s really a good deal for the price.  Try it!</li>
    <li> The softness and quality is great I want. to buy more for friends and family for Christmas presents I will recommend you to all my friend to come to your site and buy high quality professional cosmetic brushes</li>
    <li> Nice brushes but after only having them for a week the brushes started falling apart.</li>
    <li> Love Love the set!!! I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better set and the brushes are soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> AS A MAKEUP ARTIST I LIKE TO USE HIGH QUALITY BRUSHES TONGET THE BEST RESULTS WHEN APPLYING MAKEUP. THESE BRUSHED ARE SOFT, DURABLE AND WELL CRAFTED. YOURE REALLY GETTING YOUR MONEYS WORTH. I SHOPPED AROUND OTHER WEBSITES SUCH AS SIGMA ABD ITS WAAY OVER PRICED!!!!! I WILL DEFINITELY BE PURCHASING MORE BRUSHES!  IVE ALSO READ COMPLAINS ABOUT THE SMELL. YES THERE IS A SMELL BUT ITS NOTHING SOME SOAP AND WATER CANT FIX. I ACTUALLY ENJOY THE SMELL OF NEE BRUSHES!</li>
    <li> Use them everyday, good quality, and diverse enough to do anything: smoky eyes, everyday, fun... would recommend for a beginner starting out and wanting quality brushes to try new styles.... im a beginner</li>
    <li> I got these because of reviews on YouTube. I&#x27;m someone who uses Mac, Tom Ford, Chanel, Dior, Sigma and a lot of other higher brushes so I was scared to try these. They are actually pretty good. I love the blush brush and the synthetic concealer/shader brush for glitter! I would repurchase!</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars just because the brush hairs fall once in a while I been using them for a month now but not to much all out. When they arrived they were in a bunch of bubble wrape which kept them together and not getting damaged. The brushes smell like perfume, I washed mine because even thought they smelled good the smell annoyed me. Over all I like them they are good quality. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the strong smell of perfume on them but that was easyly fixed. I would buy them again and would recommend them.</li>
    <li> The set is a mixed bag, but if you are in a need of a set of decent brushes for a really great price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.  Quality is above-average, and you have everything you need in this set to do your full face makeup.  Can I mention the price again....like what, a dollar fifty per brush?  Definitely worth the money when you look at it that way!</li>
    <li> I tried this brush set for about a week everyday~Some are not that great. For the price, good buy. I&#x27;d recommend for the larger brushes, like the duo fiber, face brush and blush.</li>
    <li> They came pretty fast, I believe in less than a week.Love em!! All though the large powder brush does shed quiet a bit</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this set...I ordered the kabuki set instead! Much better...</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. I now used them more than my MAC brushes,</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! I would personally pay for one brush with the money that I paid for the whole set. The quality was brilliant and they are all sooo soft. I would definitely reccommend purchasing this makeup brush set!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all for budget beauty, but as a Pro makeup Artist, I can&#x27;t say these brushes are of the best quality. I just received mine today and unfortunately, I&#x27;m sending them back for a refund. Once I pulled them from the envelope, they started to shed, and the hairs on some of them are rather skimpy.The customer service rep was very nice, though.</li>
    <li> The brushes were horrible. Will never order from them again</li>
    <li> Honestly worth the price! They got here in 3 days. I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent and I&#x27;m happy to have found a true deal! I will continue to buy! THESE ARE EASILY SIGMA BRUSHES TWINS! I own several sets of Sigma&#x27;s and this is exactly the same! Thank THE MAKEUP GODS!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very very nice for the price.  I have using them now for two weeks and I haven&#x27;t found anything that I didn&#x27;t like about these.  The price is great. If you need make up brushes these are wonderful.</li>
    <li> they are just AMAZING brushes for an AMAZING price! I love them so much! i highly suggest yhem to anybodu in need of good quality makeup brushes for a low price!</li>
    <li> I am completely in love with these brushes! They are so dense and soft! They apply my makeup flawlessly! I am a total makeup junky, but refuse to over pay. These brushes are very similar to Sigma brushes, but at a fraction of the price. I also ordered the 4pc set of synthetic kabuki brushes, and am so glad I did. I placed my order on a Friday with standard shipping. I live in MA, and the brushes were shipped from CA. I received them on Monday!&lt;br /&gt;I will agree that they do have a sharpie like smell when you take them out of the packaging, but I always wash my brushes with baby shampoo, which took care of that.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set..  Well except the angled contour brush which sheds like a beast..</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing, and for the price? more amazing! minimal shedding and no harsh or scratchy hairs. Nice!</li>
    <li> I have had the brushes for about 2 months so I at least gave them a try.  I love all of them but the powder brush. It constantly has fall out I won&#x27;t even use it on my face at all.  I loved the shipping and everything that goes with that but next time I&#x27;ll spend a little bit more for brushes to have better quality.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be comparable to the kabuki brushes I purchased...but no dice...I wanted to upgrade to Sigma but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price...well...I got what I paid for...zilch!</li>
    <li> Just received this set today. Shipping was fast. Just as others mentioned in reviews the brush all have a odd fragrant to them. The brushes look of nice quality but I found that four out of the twelve brushes in this set were oddly shaped and shedding. I will say this set is decently worth the amount it&#x27;s going for. If your looking for a decent beginners brush set get this one but don&#x27;t expect high end quality.</li>
    <li> These are by FAR the best brushes I have used to date! They hardly shed and have such a great application of makeup giving a flawless effect! LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> I was really worried when getting these brushes, i heard good reviews about this bran. RC (royal care) cosmetics, but wasn&#x27;t sure how this set would turn out. But to my surprise its fantastic. Its actually 13 brushes, if you count the 1 double sided brush. When i got the brushes, they DID NOT smell weird, they just smelled like any regular brushes. They each came in their own wrapper wrapped in bubble wrap. The brushes are extremely soft, and didn&#x27;t even shed once. I just want to keep touching them, because they are so soft. They design is super sleek and so far none have broken, or even seemed like they would. These brushes are amazing. Stop your search, you&#x27;ve found the perfect brushes. I had checked every brush available on amazon trying to find the perfect set and im glad i chose this! The brushes not only feel professional, but look it as well. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best I have ever owned! I wanted something that was cheap but would not fall apart or shed. They feel very sturdy and do not shed when you apply makeup whatsoever! They are the exact same thing as the Sigma brush set but $121 cheaper! Overall, these brushes are the greatest and I recommend them to anyone that wants good makeup brushes that are not very expensive! The shipping was also great! I ordered them on Thursday (day before Valentine&#x27;s Day) and they arrived on Tuesday the 18th, even with no mail running on Sunday or Monday!</li>
    <li> good variety, not the best quality. nice long handles on all brushes. ok considering the sets price. would reccomend to beginners</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but I really like these brushes when I do apply my makeup.  The texture of the brushes is really soft. This is my first full set of brushes that I ever bought and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a must buy! Yes they will have a scent but you should wash your brushes anyway. I also got the kabuki set. My last few applications have come out flawless! I didn&#x27;t have to spent a fortune either. Wonderful substitute for sigma. I couldnt bring myself to spent another $100 for a brand. Girls do youself a favor a get this! I am happy I did.</li>
    <li> OMG the best Brushes set ever, u guys have in diffrents Colors????? I wanna one more set but in Pink...</li>
    <li> So I had bought these brushes thinking they would be the most amazing brushes I would buy online I was WRONG when I first received the brushes I was excited to open them to start feeling them but right when I pulled them out of the packaging I start to pull the hair to see how strong they are but not even the hardest pull ALL the hair that was taken off from the PINCH I pulled from the brush hair CAME OFF then I start pulling More and More and half of the hair from the Powder brush was GONE. but then the white contour brush, fluffy eye shadow brush, foundation brush shed bad also and these brushes have a very uncomfortable smell I had washes these bushes more than 3 times when I received them and the smell wouldn&#x27;t go away. their are more dupes that are the same price as these. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just received these brushes in the mail the other day (which only took 5 business days) and I absolutely love these brushes. For the price, they are of great quality. People have been comparing these brushes to the Sigma and Sedona Lace brushes which is actually pretty accurate. Don&#x27;t be shied away because reviews have said that the brushes smelled strong and had shedding. It is perfectly normal for new brushes to shed, but this will go away with the first wash, as well as the smell. I&#x27;m guessing the smell comes from outsourced factories, which is what makes these brushes so affordable. Sigma and Sedona Lace hand check their brushes as well, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there were a few hiccups here and there... Also, the eye brushes are very dense and comparable to the Sigma E65 and E10. The powder brushes are not as dense as the big name brushes, but do their job well. Overall, I recommend these brushes if your looking for the quality and not wanting to spend over $100 on brushes that will do the same job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at the quality of these brushes,  I recommend it definitely&lt;br /&gt;they have a softness that i love. are a good investment</li>
    <li> So Im just beginning to get into makeup and decided to just find some brushes on amazon to use for my first time. I was a little skeptical at first because I kept hearing about bad brushes, and shedding and just poor quality. But to me, these brushes are great. They were very soft. Yes I have been inside Sephora and Drugstores to feel brushes just to see the quality and I was very pleased with the bristles. I also washed my brushes and noticed only a little bit of shedding in the angled powder brush and in the foundation brush. And when I say a little, I mean 2 strands the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was not satisfied with the packaging. Each of the brushes came individually wrapped in plastic which was a good thing, but there was no case at all. I know it says it does not come with it, but I would&#x27;ve gave it a 5 if I had a case being as though these are my first set and now they are just sitting on my dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great brushes to begin with. I am satisfied &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Loved most of my brushes&lt;br /&gt;The angled blush brush smells like a dirty dog&lt;br /&gt;The small blending whitish brush is not so good .. But very satisfied with the rest</li>
    <li> Working perfectly, as opposed to other professional make-up brushes, that cost a fortune. They r inexpensive and do the job.</li>
    <li> I surely recommend buying this product. Great variety and smooth set.  I had a prompt and courteous service, the item arrived on time and in perfect conditions. I think we (costumers) should be completely honest about our purchases so we can select the companies which provide a good service avoiding us of having trouble in the future.</li>
    <li> When I received these products it was was 2 days before the estimated arrival date. Jsut 2 days after it was ordered with no special shipping. I cleaned the brushes and since these didnt come in a plastic case they didnt have that &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; everyone talks about. I really like them used them for the first time this morning and had little to no shedding.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would say that these are quality brushes for little $$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccommend to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets and one of the brushes included was a contour brush. One set had a decent one and the other didn&#x27;t look recognizable. It didn&#x27;t have that slant in it, looked like a powder brush. The eyeshadow brushes were too dense too. The shedding wasn&#x27;t bad at all for a 1st time use I can say. Get what you payed for.</li>
    <li> This product was overall pretty good considering the really good price. The Brushes all do the job pretty well. The only problem I encountered was the Fall out from the synthetic hair. But it&#x27;s not that big of a problem. Good beginner brush set.</li>
    <li> I purchased the brushes with the expectation to only utilize the eye brushes. I&#x27;m glad that was my intentions as the face brushes are rather cheap in quality... I understand the price was inexpensive however I have purchased some inexpensive brushes with a much better pay off...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my package and two of the brushes had bent and dented felts the handels are rather large and bulky, the brushes them selves are not the size of normal brushes they are super large... in comparison to other brushes. I&#x27;m sure I will make use of these brushes one way or another but I wont invest in the product anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you own quality brushes than these wouldn&#x27;t be something your looking for but you can make use of the eye brushes..</li>
    <li> muy bueno, de excelente calidad</li>
    <li> I just received these brushes, and I like them. I don&#x27;t love them; but they are good quality for the price. They do seem rather big, but that&#x27;s not really an issue for me. The brushes are soft, and well put together. They do have a strong scent to them once you get them, so you have to wash them and let them air out before use. I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding yet; but I haven&#x27;t used them yet. Bottom line, these are great if you aren&#x27;t super picky and don&#x27;t compare them to MAC brushes or anything like that. They are great for beginners and for people who don&#x27;t wear makeup every single day. They will do exactly what I need them to do. Don&#x27;t expect these brushed to be magic brushes or change the way your makeup looks. Just remember, most of the time, its not the brushes that doesn&#x27;t apply the makeup correctly...its the person. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> i love the brushes. i have so many i do not know what to do with them.  My make up glidees on effortlessly now.  thanks!</li>
    <li> Makeup brushes were processed and shipped same day of purchase. Makeup brushes arrived in 3 days of purchase. Brushes smelled well upon opening package. I experience little to no shedding. Makeup brushes are soft and most important they work very well. Ladies and gents if you love sigma brushes you will love these brushes, with out the sigma price.</li>
    <li> Very soft and nice, a must have for the make up artist just starting out or for personal use. This is worth every penny and more.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes on a friday and recieved them on a monday. The brushes are soft.  The only problem you&#x27;ll probably have is a loud perfume sent just wash the brushes and they will be fine. But overall i love them</li>
    <li> you can tell from the material, very cheap material, tried one time and never used it anymore, sorry i guess money can talk if you buy the expensive than you got the high quality, thanks</li>
    <li> My girlfriend asked me to buy these and ship them to her cousin in the Philippines. She said they were better condition than some of her higher end brushes that&#x27;s she&#x27;s bought at the mall boutiques. Now she&#x27;s having me order another set for her.</li>
    <li> the foundation brush and the concealer brush are very VERY soft and smooth, and work very very well. i love them!&lt;br /&gt;but all of the brushes that are white, smell like wet, dirty dog for some reason...&lt;br /&gt;the flat top stippling brush is very soft and works fairly well, not my favorite though.&lt;br /&gt;as for the black-brissled brushes, i find them to be slightly hard, and blending in a certain eyeshadow can be painful after a while of just swiping it across my eyelid/:</li>
    <li> Exactly what was promised. Good quality brushes at an affordable price. I will be ordering more sets around the holidays to give to my female friends!</li>
