<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Handled excellent......</li>
    <li> I read some reviews that it smells foul, but the block I got smells wonderfully like honey. I am using it for mascara and other home made / diy needs.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Have used in multiple recipes and found it worked really nicely.</li>
    <li> This product will be great for my lip balm products. Smells nice and the price is definitely fair compared to other places I have looked in to.</li>
    <li> MAMA HAS MADE CANDLES &amp; ALSO IS USING THIS FOR HOME REMEDIES WHEN YOU BECOME ILL.&lt;br /&gt;SHE THINKS IT&#x27;S GREAT.</li>
    <li> Clean, good smell, as advertised</li>
    <li> This beeswax smells absolutely wonderful. I ordered it to make sunscreen and for homemade body creams and am super satisfied. I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> One part this plus 4 parts mineral oil makes a great finish for butcher block counter tops.  Melt the mixture in a hot water bath, cool, wipe on a small amount with a sponge.</li>
    <li> Seemed good but was not 16 ozs but 13.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a big hunk of wax of good quality - uniform, no impurities, smells and feels good in hand.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Bear Makers:  Melts quickly, stays smooth... very high quality.  Perfect for waxing bear noses, re-melts nicely after applying to the cotton floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from crafting, I&#x27;d love to try making something more day-to-day with this... like lip balm.  It just has such a nice light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back for more of this when I burn through this 1 pound block.  It&#x27;s definitely replacing the blocks I had been buying prior to trying this supplier.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for that for a long time nd a. Friend said something about Amazon. Worked great for me. Also received excellent quality product. Thank you. Michel Blais</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for your organic, homemade lotions, creams, etc.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bees wax what else can be said</li>
    <li> High quality.  Melts smooth and pure.</li>
    <li> The beeswax block that arrived was sealed in a thin plastic. As many others have mentioned, the block is different from the picture. My beeswax is a trapezoidal prism, pale yellow in color with a sweet honey smell. The block is fairly brittle, but I do not have any other beeswax to compare it to. So far I&#x27;ve used the beeswax primarily to condition wood with mineral oil. The wax blends well when heated and the resulting mixture keeps the sweet smell of the original block. I&#x27;ve had great results so far. The mixture will darken cutting boards slightly, leaving a nice smooth finish. I also used the mixture on an old navy sea chest (family heirloom). The chest has been used extensively and the wood was very dry so it absorbed quite a bit of the beeswax mixture. The result was a much darker, healthier looking wood. Before applying any conditioners to wood, don&#x27;t forget to wipe the dirt off with a clean cloth--wet or dry depending on preference.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in making their own beeswax based products. I&#x27;m exploring it for wood conditioning, leather water proofing, and lip balm. The organic factor comes in most importantly with the lip balm. I did not think to weigh the block when I received it, but the size is more than enough to provide for all the uses I mentioned.  Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. A+</li>
    <li> This block wasn&#x27;t square or imprinted with \\&quot;beeswax\\&quot; like the picture suggests, but I don&#x27;t care about that at all!  It smells absolutely divine, and I love that it is purely organic.  Some beeswax that you buy from the store barely has any scent, this smells like you are sticking your nose in a hive or something; it&#x27;s rich and smells like honey.  It also works very well in all of the lotion/body butter/lip product applications I&#x27;ve used it in, I highly suggest it.</li>
    <li> this is just a simple block of fresh beeswax.  That is all, smells fresh, like honey exactly one pound! thanks</li>
    <li> Got this for doing beeswax collage ATCs. Good product and a great price as I found out yesterday when I looked at some in the craft store.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as expected.  (formed a wax mouthpiece for my didgeridoo)</li>
    <li> I have ordered beeswax from a few different sellers, but this one so far has smelled the best. It came in a big block, so you will have to chop it up yourself. Nice item for making solid lotion bars. Just melt over a double boiler with your oils and butters.</li>
    <li> It is pure, natural and also has this quaint honey smell.</li>
    <li> This arrived as one pound of beeswax. It was not dark yellow, nor did it say \\&quot;BEESWAX\\&quot; on it. But it is. Very nice!</li>
    <li> What I received is not the pictured item. The block is pale yellow (not bleached white) - not the rich gold pictured. Very faint beeswax smell, that turns into an unpleasant processed smell while grating or melting. Very dry sticky crumbly wax. I chose this item because it said it was organic and the color in the photo is what I normally associate with a rich beeswax smell and creamy texture. Based on the processed color, smell, and texture - it might have come from an organic source but their processing is far more industrial than the naturalness associated with an organic product. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> So many possibilities with this! Beeswax is pure and we are having a blast making homemade lip balms and beard waxes out of it.</li>
    <li> Very pure, very clean, very uniform.  Not much else to say about it, its a lot of high quality beeswax for not a lot of money.</li>
    <li> The only reason I took off a star is because it was hard for me to cut. I wanted to melt down part of the bar, but it was so hard to slice I think I&#x27;m gonna end up melting the whole thing at once.</li>
    <li> So i have been searching HARD for organic beeswax. Came across this item and another similar item from a different seller. Heres where the confusion happens. The product reviews are identical. HOW CAN TWO SEPERATE PRODUCTS FROM SEPERATE SELLERS HAVE THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT REVIEWS? Is Amazon using reviews twice? Is this dubious seeming to anyone else? Unfortunately this is actually the second time i have seen this on Amazon, first time i commented on it though as i assumed it was a fluke the first time. I research and plan my purchases very carfully as i have very specific needs from the items i buy usually, and i kind of feel like Amazon is trying to smoke screen me here. I dont appreciate it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for homemade deoderants and for the body. Simply meltbthe desired portion into a pot and use as needed. I LOVE beeswax. Enjoy</li>
    <li> But I&#x27;ll tell you anyway.    So I bought this beeswax in order to make my own mustache wax blend.   Having no control to compare this to, this beeswax is more organic than any other I&#x27;ve used.  It melts well.  Combines with petroleum jelly well.  Hardens as expected.  The best part is that I&#x27;m smelling a faint honey aroma all day rather than the chemically glue like smell of the mass fabricated wax I used prior.      The picture is somewhat misleading.  Sadly, the melted in \\&quot;BEESWAX\\&quot; is not melted in.  I&#x27;m sure with a little patience and wherewithal, a person could melt their own labeling on it, so as to avoid confusing it with a block of cheddar (for those without a sense of taste, smell, and touch).     Anyway, make this your beeswax, poindexter.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy for beeswax if you need a large amount. It works well for my homemade skin care bars. You can use beeswax for many things and it keeps very well.</li>
    <li> I use it to wax my threads....it&#x27;s excellent</li>
    <li> This beeswax was excellent quality. I used it to make candles and it melted and smelled absolutely perfect. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Love the nature scent of beeswax. I used it to make a body cream, it is so rich and smooth.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awful. Currently in process of receiving a return.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, will be ordering again. I purchased this because I made lip balm for x-mas presents. As other have said it doesn&#x27;t have anything melted into it (such as the name shown in the photo), rather it look like a chunk of fresh Parmesan cheese (as another reviewer said). I personally just grated off what I needed instead of buying the pearls.</li>
    <li> When I received the package I was excited!  I purchased the organic beeswax for my lip balm and lotions that I wanted to make.  When I took the beeswax out of the box, it smelled soooo delicious, I mean it smelled just like honey!,(of course). Since then I&#x27;ve used it for making lip balm and it works nicely!  It blends well with all the other ingredients that I use with it.  I love it and I will  most definitely look to purchasing this product when I run out and need more. I found this beeswax was much cheaper than the brand in the craft stores here.  Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Beeswax, just like it says.  Organic block of beeswax for whatever you may need it for.  Good for arts and crafts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have a way to rate the quality of beeswax but it does appear to be a lighter color than the picture. It is also missing the word beeswax.</li>
    <li> This beeswax is terrific. It smells great and looks natural (that&#x27;s because it IS natural, it&#x27;s ORGANIC). This is probably the best deal on the internet for organic beeswax. I made lip balm out of it. It is the BEST! Some other reviewers said that it didn&#x27;t look like the right color. Well, the one I got looked fine. It didn&#x27;t say beeswax on it, but WHO CARES? I would definitely order this again, I have no regrets.</li>
    <li> The product looked different from what&#x27;s being shown in the picture, but however, it still is of good quality and I recommend it. I can smell the aroma of fresh honey on it.</li>
    <li> This beeswax is divine. It smells so good. The neat cutesy little bar shown in the product picture is ridiculous. Mine did not look like that and I&#x27;m very glad it didn&#x27;t. My beeswax looked like a chunk that was chopped from a larger block. Looked like something you would buy from a farmer&#x27;s market. It has a wonderful texture and I really wanted to eat it, but that&#x27;s not what I bought it for. I had no problem melting it and used it in a homemade facial moisturizer. This 1 lb block is going to last FOREVER. Great product!</li>
    <li> I excitedly anticipated the arrival of my order to make my first batch of beeswax candles, I went with an organic beeswax expecting it to have a nice pleasant honey smell.  When my order arrived I hurriedly opened the package and was disappointed to find it smelt like melted plastic.  I took 1lb and thought &amp;#34;well maybe it will smell better after it is re-melted&amp;#34;... it did not.  Unfortunately, I now have a candle that smells like melted crayons.  I will be returning the other pound and searching for a place to get beeswax locally so I can smell it before I buy it.</li>
    <li> This beeswax smells wonderful, but if you don&#x27;t want a strong smell I would recommend unscented beeswax. I love the smell, and use it in my creams. It works well.</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is.  I have not done anything with it yet so I can&#x27;t tell you anything about how great the product is. But it looks good and had no issues with shipping or receiving</li>
    <li> I bought this to wax sticky wood drawers on an old dresser that did not have glides.  This wax did the trick and smells nice, like honey.  It came in a big non-descript \\&quot;hunk\\&quot; like someone broke it off a huge bar with a sledge hammer.  Obviously, I got way too much wax for what I needed it for, but can&#x27;t beat the price for all that wax!</li>
    <li> A very cool block of Beeswax! Try including this ingredient in your DIY lotion efforts and you will see some unique benefits. Everyone needs a block of beeswax like this!</li>
    <li> I received the beeswax and it smells like smoke. I tried putting lavender oil in it and it helps a little but it still smells smokey. My daughter-in-law raised bees and she said it is from commercial smoking to get the wax.&lt;br /&gt;would not buy again.</li>
    <li> PROs:&lt;br /&gt;1.  One pound of organic beeswax for $14.50 delivered?  Best price I could find.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Actual weight of beeswax is 17.5 ounces--just over a pound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;1.  While not a problem for me, the beeswax block simply is a cut from a bigger block of wax, so it doesn&#x27;t look like a tidy bar as in the photo.  However, I think this would only be an issue if you were buying this as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of the beeswax is a rich, golden yellow, just as depicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this beeswax.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to get a pound of beeswax.  Some things cannot be bought at a local store.  However, I wish that it was marked someway to allow me to follow a recipe for some wood paste wax more accurately.  I winged it and it turned out okay.</li>
    <li> I use this to cap Shitake plugs. This is an economical way to buy.</li>
    <li> Nice but next time I&#x27;ll buy more than 1lb, even though 1lb go&#x27;s a long........way.</li>
    <li> I received the beeswax in a timely matter, however, immediatly upon opening the package and smelling the octagonal shaped beeswax with the name saaqin stamped in them I realized the wax was no good.  The beeswax smelled burnt and had a chemical smell to it.  Also, I live in Los Angeles area and wonder why this was shipped from the east coast when supposedly it was made locally in Southern California.  I requested a return through the seller and received this: \\&quot;Greetings, the smell of the beeswax no one has control on it, it depends on the time of the yaar on how the beeswax was collected and the geographical location. our beeswax is of the highest quality. thank you, imed.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend people not purchase from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you read the better reviews on their other products you&#x27;ll notice the are identical to the better reviews for beeswax.  I will be reporting this to amazon.</li>
    <li> Worked well for candles.</li>
    <li> Bought this item to make some lips balm and chapstick with coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;works great</li>
    <li> I love the soft honey like smell that this wax has.</li>
    <li> As advertised, it is unbleached beeswax that still has that faint honeybee smell to it.  It should work well!</li>
    <li> purchased this instead of the usual 1-2 oz amount required to seal the seams and screw holes on my slate pool table.  Came just as described but the picture indicates a block when the actual item is a hexagon.</li>
    <li> Guess I am adding to the mixed review of this product.  My bar of beeswax looks much like the photo only a lot darker and it has an unpleasant odor.  I have completed one cycle of filtering the wax and found a great deal of something dark left from the filtering.  Once filtered I think it will make nice looking candles but I am not certain what to do about the smell</li>
    <li> this is the real thing and works well for the lotion my wife makes out of it........no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous because I saw some pretty stinky reviews on this. But the block I got was pretty much exactly what you see in the picture, only bigger and better! It has a nice color, nice texture and a nice smell. Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> From the mixed reviews, I knew that it was a gamble ordering this. And I mostly just wanted to practice making things with it so I decided that quality wasn&#x27;t priority.&lt;br /&gt;But it arrived very fast and when I opened it up, it was a yellow brick with beeswax stamped right on it. It actually looked nicer than in the photo!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my allergies had been acting up so I couldn&#x27;t smell it but my family said it smelled nice. I figured it would still smell kind of unnatural or something, but when my allergies cleared up, it smells great! Raw and fresh and perfect for all of the products that I&#x27;m making with it. I already ordered another brick from the same fantastic seller, and I&#x27;m eager to work with it.</li>
    <li> Very high quality and well refined.  Used to soak 100% cotton balls in and use to start camp fires during outings.  Burns long and hot and even dries damp wood for more efficient fires.  Excellent quality for candles or any other applications.  Will definitely order from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I make my own lip balm and this is one of the ingredients for my balm. The ground shipping was free because my order was over a minimum amount and I received this in under one business week. I would recommend this product to friends and family and will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Arrived quickly. Nicely packaged. Looks and smells great, nice and fresh. Looks just like the block at our local natural foods store but it&#x27;s $7 less on Amazon. I chopped a hunk off (carefully because it&#x27;s not easy to cut) and made a lovely salve. This will last a long time for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, I bought it to use a sealer for my aquaponic system. And, it works great! High quality, and I believe you could use this product for many different uses!</li>
    <li> Perfect for home crafts! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I used this product to make a food safe finish for some decorative wooden cutting boards I made as Christmas presents.  It arrived when promised by Priority Mail, consisted of a 1 3/8&amp;#34; block of wax packed in a thick ziplock bag and worked great. I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My order came quickly and packaged fine. Upon opening my package I pulled out two heavy plastic ziplock bags labeled &amp;#34;Saaqin&amp;#34; with hexagon shaped beeswax blocks. They have the name Saaqin melted into them. The color looked normal. They do not smell like beeswax (sweet, honey). They smelled like a plastic bag. It&#x27;s a very hard product. Harder then candle wax. It was difficult to grate. It melted and mixed with coconut oil just fine. It seems from the mixed reviews that this distributer has a few different suppliers which has caused inconsistency with orders. Based on the product alone I would not purchase from them again. Delivery and packaging was good.</li>
    <li> Great product pure beewax works great on all my leather items. Makes them shine and seals leather from water.Great seller!</li>
    <li> This states it&#x27;s organic yet does not smell fragrent, like sweet honey wax, at all. When it arrived there was also no description of which company it came from. I&#x27;m questioning whether it&#x27;s advertisements for &amp;#34;raw beeswax&amp;#34; is accurate or if I even got what I ordered. It seems processed and unfragrent.</li>
    <li> The beeswax smells so good I want to eat it.  It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  It works well for making homemade salves and lotions.</li>
    <li> I ordered this stuff to make Gunny&#x27;s Paste for my wooden stocked military rifles and to make Tincloth, The stuff was 100% organic Bees wax and beats the prices charged in my local area. The Smell is incredible as well, I really enjoyed cooking this stuff up. Be warned that this stuff comes in an octagon shaped brick but that shouldn&#x27;t matter because a block of bees wax is still a block of bees wax. ALSO NOTE if you are using this stuff for something other than cosmetics or food you could just settle with Plumbers gaskets for toilets. They are way cheaper and are made of beeswax as well.</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with Beeswax as it was my first time purchasing it, but it was SO difficult to cut!!! I ruined 2 knives in doing so. And it took SO long to melt. The quality is great but the functionality of only wanting some (I was making my own lotions) is little.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems other reviewers have posted. It&#x27;s a a one pound block of beeswax, with raised &amp;#34;Beeswax&amp;#34; lettering on the side. Yellow, smells just like beeswax should. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I was worried because I never ordered beeswax before so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. This was excellent. Organic, packed in bead form in a medium size bag, works great, has a light smell of beeswax but very nice. Can&#x27;t wait to use for all my projects. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> The stuff smells great.  It was one solid block and was easily made into candles.  I also made a beard balm and lip balm with it.  Good stuff, great price.</li>
    <li> Used this for making homemade hand cream this winter.  My hands were soft and smooth while every one else&#x27;s were dry and cracking.  Also made a couple extra batches to give away.  One friend&#x27;s dry cracked hands healed up in no time!  The way to go.  All natural and no unneccesary ingredients</li>
    <li> Beeswax was really good...wuld recommend getting this</li>
    <li> After extensive reading about beekeeping, I realized how important &#x27;organic&#x27; is if you are going to use their wax for any cosmetic product, around food, or near your own healthy bees.  The majority of beekeepers are heavily medicating honeybees for various diseases and these antibiotics and other drugs are then transmitted by the  honeybees into their own honey , wax, propolis, etc.  Well worth buying &#x27;organic&#x27;.  This product was well sealed, packed, and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> The beeswax came fast and was as expected.  I did not realize how it smells which was a downside.  This was more my fault than the product.  I would suggest knowing what it smells like before you buy.</li>
    <li> Is not natural. It smelled extremely burnt. Its suppose to be sweet smelling just like honey</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically to make wood butter (a mix of mineral oil &amp; beeswax to treat wooden kitchen utensils) and it worked beautifully.</li>
    <li> Smells like petroleum combined with honey....  ewww!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and has a sweet honey smell. This product was shipped quickly and I am very pleased with the candles I have made with it.</li>
    <li> very hard to cut up.  will buy the beads next time. couldn&#x27;t slice grate or even peel with a veg. peeler</li>
    <li> The product I received didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture, it maybe what it says, but don&#x27;t expect it to look like it. It looks like a broken off chunk of wax.</li>
    <li> I use this to make creams.  It was exactly what was described.  Arrived quickly. The price is better than any  have seen any where.</li>
    <li> Performed as expected.</li>
    <li> Have pleasant smell of honey, not to strong. Very good in melting, and than easy can be combine with other substance. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make up a batch of lip balm for the first time and it worked great. I liked it so much, that I have made more lip balm and shared it with others. It is a good quality bees wax. And I am very pleased that I have it.</li>
    <li> I use this wax when I reload ammo. This is natures great lube. It has more uses than just bullet lube. I applied some to a sticky door knob, worked great.</li>
    <li> Fabulous for herbal recipe&#x27;s. lipbalms, creams, etc.</li>
    <li> Good stuff great price, just what I needed for hobby work</li>
    <li> I like the consitency of the Bee&#x27;s wax when I use it to stabilize salve mixtures. It gives me the texture that I prefer.</li>
    <li> Came in a 1lb block, was a good quality and consistency; it was really all I wanted and more. Thanks!</li>
    <li> 100% great beeswax for all my prepare needs makes great candles , great waterproof  good bow string wax  Melts  down clean incubuswarlock@G.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 pounds.  The delivery was timely but when I opened the packages to smell them- they were disgusting. They smelled like chemicals and toxins. When I emailed them asking for a refund for the one block I had not used the response was: &amp;#34;Greetings,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is utterly non sense, if you not unsealed the bag yet, you may send it back for a refund to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;343 W JOHN ST&lt;br /&gt;HICKSVILLE NY 11801&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not appreciate being told my complaint &amp;#34;is utterly non sense&amp;#34;.  And I fail to understand why they won&#x27;t take the wax back since THEY WOULD KNOW IF I HAD USED ANY OF IT!!!  It is still EXACTLY the SAME as it was when it was sent to me except the bag is open.  Other products can get away with this and I would understand, but this is WAX poured, branded and designed by SaaQin- I DON&#x27;T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT TO MAKE AN EXACT REPRODUCTION OF THEIR WAX! Who does?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition- NO WHERE on the amazon seller&#x27;s page does it say ANYTHING about the product being produced by SaaQin. They credit local farms as being the source for their wax.</li>
    <li> I was slightly disappointed with this purchase because I was hoping for the block of beeswax that is pictured that is a deep amber/honey color (with jagged edges). The first block I ordered (can&#x27;t remember who I ordered from!) looked just like that picture so I was hoping that this was the same seller. That first block also smelled AMAZING and had such a strong scent of honey to it! I LOVED it and wanted more of that! However, the bars that I got were like the one in that other picture... they were a very light yellow color and had a VERY faint scent of honey. These are organic unrefined beeswax... I expected them to be the NATURAL honey color with honey scent. However, because it is still beeswax and it works for what I need it for, I am giving this 4 stars. It was a good price too.... just with is was more natural and less refined and smelled like honey! :)</li>
    <li> This block of beeswax does not come in the bar that was shown as the picture. Instead, it comes in a block. Nevertheless, it is still sweet smelling just like the honey itself.</li>
    <li> I make mesquite cutting boards and I use this melted and mixed with mineral oil for the finish of my boards.  This works wonderfully.  It is easy to work with and this one pound block will probably last me quite a while.  Terrific value for my application.</li>
    <li> Great stuff....Have used it in lotion bars. Worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting into woodturning after being a machinist for over 20yrs and having to retire from a blown disc. I&#x27;ve used a few different mixed wax sticks for polishing the wood before taking it out of the lathe and most of them use Bees Wax as a base. Those sticks are very expensive so I bought this and some Carnauba Wax to mix my own. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with the wax. The piece I got isn&#x27;t like what is in the picture. Mine looks like it was poured in a mold shaped like a hexagon and about an inch thick or a little less. It has good consistent color to it and looks to be nice and pure. For my uses its working out very well and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Well it is what it is. Just a big ole block of bees wax. I made lotion bars with it and they turned out well.</li>
    <li> When this beeswax showed up I was very sad. I had to return it. It was a little off in color, too yellow and it had a strange smell. It actually smelled quite bad. When I read through some of the other reviews on Amazon after I received it in the mail, I noticed that many said that the smell was chemical or smokey. I would say mine did smell like smoke. Cigarette smoke in fact. I compared this beeswax to the beeswax I purchased from a local apiary and the apiary beeswax smells like very strong honey, sweet and wonderful. The beeswax I purchased off of Amazon made me a little sick to my stomach to smell. After that I did some research on beeswax and found out that many places sell impure or beeswax cut with other substances like parafin and call it raw beeswax. I would not recommend buying this product because based off of my experience with my purchase, this listing for beeswax is not actually pure beeswax. Pure beeswax should never smell like smoke, or chemicals or anything other than honey.</li>
    <li> This is good.  Not as pictured, but it&#x27;s exactly what was described, an unbleached 1lb block of beeswax.</li>
    <li> Too processed. Has strange texture and smell.</li>
    <li> Very hard to grate; I found the pellets much easier to work with.  Once grated, though, it makes great balms &amp; soaps.</li>
    <li> Like the title suggests, the color and smell are off.  I have seen and smelled real beeswax candles before and the color and smell are completely different.  It smells somewhat like beeswax, but it also smells like commercial candles.  And the color is nothing like what is pictured.  It is more like the second picture.  A very pale block.  I don&#x27;t care about the engraving, but it also does not include it.  I am a little disappointed, but the wax still works.  I will buy another type of wax next time.</li>
    <li> The beeswax was very good quality and worked very well for what I was using it for. It was somewhat difficult to grate for my product but it had a good smell, it melted well in the oil I was using and works great in my baby butt salve that I made. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> There is no such thing as Organic beeswax...or Organic honey for that matter. There is no way for the beekeeper to insure the bees visited only Organic flowers (if there is such a thing) in their travels. If this use of Organic influences your buying decision, then I have some Organic Paraffin oil for your cosmetic use.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using beeswax in my homemade projects, and I really loved using it.  The block of beeswax has a slight honey scent to it which is very pleasant, and it was not too difficult to cut (which I did to melt it faster). I found it kind of strange, but not necessarily a bad thing that when I cut into the center of the block that the center was made up of the little beeswax pellets (it looks like the block was formed from the melted pellets and so when it was cut the pellets crumbled out of the middle of the block), mine just didn&#x27;t melt in the middle when it was formed I suppose; since I melt my beeswax, it didn&#x27;t matter what form it was in, but that might be of use to someone looking to use it for other purposes. I personally used my beeswax in my homemade deodorant recipe to keep it more of a solid and help it glide smoother which it worked great in doing. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I used this to make lip balm in the tubes, like chapstic.  Anyway it is really a pure wax and worked great for that purpose</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was searching for. Look no further for a quality beeswax at an affordable price. I&#x27;ve bought other brands and this is far superior.</li>
    <li> I got one of the bad batches. Here are some things I learned after poking around online and asking for advice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You should not be able to smell the beeswax outside the package, and it really shouldn&#x27;t smell like petroleum, smoke, chemicals, or mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If your package does not have a label or seal other than an Amazon barcode sticker, chances are it&#x27;s the super cheap stuff. Mine had none and I didn&#x27;t think about it until later. The description claims it comes from an organic farm, but from everything I&#x27;ve learned (and the real organic beeswax I&#x27;ve since been able to get a hold of) this is a false claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Unfortunately, spend the extra money for something with a USDA seal or find a local food market or beekeeper to purchase from instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, if you&#x27;re using this to make lotion, for the love of kittens please think twice before using a food processor. I used beeswax pellets and it took me literally hours to get it out of every tiny little plastic crevice the food processor had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure most buyers use this product for candle-making, but I bought it to treat sticky wood drawers--it works very well for this!</li>
    <li> I use it to make waterproof sunscreen, lip balm and diaper cream.  It is a good and very useful product.</li>
    <li> The item I received is not a single block as shown. Instead it was crumbled into lots of very dry little pieces .  It had a faint scent that didn&#x27;t resemble the sweet and honey beeswax smell.</li>
    <li> I bought for my son.  He says its okay.</li>
    <li> This was a good product, it shipped fast and I am happy with it. I used it to make lotion bars for my sons severe eczema. It melted well with a  double boiler and was the perfect addition to my sons lotion bars.</li>
    <li> i plan on using this beeswax for candles and possibly lotions, soap, deodorant. the only reason i didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because i&#x27;ve ordered pure beeswax candles and the smell was really nice/natural. the smell of this isn&#x27;t what i expected, so i&#x27;ll definitely have to mix some kind of essential oil in for candles, instead of just using pure beeswax. BUT, i don&#x27;t regret this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;brick&amp;#34; of beeswax came all in one piece. I&#x27;ve already used it in a lip balm recipe and it worked as well as beeswax I&#x27;ve previously used. I would definately buy again!</li>
    <li> I used this beeswax in a homemade salve recipe as well as to make some homemade beeswax candles.  It has a faint pleasant smell and was really easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion I have for the seller/supplier is to include an official organic certification in the package.  The block of beeswax (which mine didn&#x27;t have the BEESWAX stamp in it) just comes in a plastic ziplock bag with no information about it&#x27;s organic certification or where it comes from.  I am giving them the benefit of the doubt that it is organic, but it would be nice to see some actual documentation beyond the written Amazon description.</li>
    <li> What can you say, it is beeswax.  I was shipped and delivered quickly.  It was not is a single block as shown but was in two or three pieces that appeared to be broken off of a larger chunck.  For my purpose it doesn&#x27;t matter as I am going to melt it into some raw linseed oil and paint my beehives with it.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than a good solid block of beeswax. I have used it for everything froom wood butter for my wooden utensils to keeping drawers in good sliding condition to a homemade hand balm.</li>
    <li> Quite pleased with product.Understand Im no expert on beeswax but this does what we want it to do,so IMO a good product at a good price,use it with our archery keeping strings waxed.Will be a lifetime supply for that use.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on the zippers of my Jeep. It works great! Unlike petroleum based products that &#x27;catch&#x27; dirt and grime and do damage to your zippers, the beeswax just allows the zippers to glide smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller blocks of wax are easier to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two beeswax so far.  I preferred the other one, but it was much more money  I know you get what you pay for and this stuff is still good, which is why I rated it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good value.  Still organic.  It was brittle than the other product which seemed more waxy.  Some of the pictures show it well, it is a light yellow, not a dark rich yellow that other pictures show.  No beeswax text imprint either.  Also, in a weird shape and not square so sort of angled polygon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;ll probably order again because I am melting it so who cares what it looks like raw.  But it is not quite as nice as some other products out there.</li>
    <li> It was better than I expected based on some of the other reviews.  &amp;#34;Beeswax&amp;#34; was imprinted on the bar and it has a pleasant color and odor.  I used it to lay a follower bead of wax on the bars in my top bar hive.</li>
    <li> I only buy from prime sellers. Other sellers are almost always ripoffs, thus thew negative reviews. The bar came as described: RAW. There were still bee&#x27;s legs and everything in the wax. That&#x27;s good! Anyways, the bar did indeed has &amp;#34;Bees Wax&amp;#34; etched into it as others are describing. Mine was a square bar, not rectangular. I should&#x27;ve weighed the bar to make sure it&#x27;s a pound...oh well. Learn from this review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and came sooner than expected. I am still to use it for what we need it for (that&#x27;s exactly what people want to read, right? lol) but I can tell that it&#x27;ll work great for some candles I want to make.</li>
    <li> Extremely dirty! Completely unacceptable for making personal care products. You wouldn&#x27;t want to melt this to put it on creams for your skin.</li>
    <li> This block of beeswax was hard for me to work with at first, until I realized I could use a cheese grater on it to be able to put it into workable portions for what I needed it for.  It has a very light sweet scent and it is nice :) Great product.</li>
    <li> Wen it comes to quality I always try to get the best. This organic beeswax is really unique, I use it to make homemade Chapstick. I save a lot of money and keep my lips soft without chemicals.</li>
    <li> the wax appears pure and uniform. Some want to make homemade electrolytic capacitors with this stuff&lt;br /&gt;because of it&#x27;s electret properties ( as did Tesla).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems I saw listed after the fact after I had already purchased. It looks exactly as pictured, smells very nice and lightly of honey. It&#x27;s really hard to cut, but I should have known that lol. It is beeswax after all. But I am very happy with this product, I hope that others that purchase have the same good experience as I have.</li>
    <li> Its raw and its a great price, perfect for the homemade lotions I made. Nice and tacky, keeps the moisture in my hands and really does repair them. It arrived in heat sealed clear plastic bag, the wax was in a hexagonal brick, looked raw and unbleached, smelled like honey. Exactly what I expected and wanted to see.</li>
    <li> I bought this brick of wax because I needed to coat the handle of my Wetterling&#x27;s axe. That doesn&#x27;t take much at all. In retrospect, I wish I had bought a small block at Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s, they are only a few bucks. The good thing is that I found a bunch of new uses for beeswax, such as:&lt;br /&gt;1. Great for lubricating zippers&lt;br /&gt;2. prevents doors from sticking at points of contact&lt;br /&gt;3. They make awesome scented candles&lt;br /&gt;4. paperweight</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with the beeswax I received. Yes, it does not say \\&quot;beeswax\\&quot; nor does it appear to be straight from a mold (it is broken, maybe in half?) but it is STILL beeswax. I will surely be a repeat customer since I make my own lotions and will be expanding my business.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It serves its purpose. However, next time, I will probably purchase the pellets. This product is hard to grate up .</li>
    <li> I got this large cake of beeswax mainly for waxing the strings of my hunting bows, but it would also be very good for making a high quality buffing wax for furniture.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was a fast shipper which adds greatly to the value of the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet and will update once I do. But, I had to put it out there that it didn&#x27;t have a terrible smell as I have read by other reviewers for different sellers.</li>
    <li> The block of this I purchased was yellow gray and has a musty odor. It should smell sweet and honey like. I wanted to use organic wax to make my own personal care products but this was completely unacceptable for any such use. The musty smell says anything except organic! It does not look like the photo either. I kept the block anyway as I use it for other purposes. I can&#x27;t wait to get rid of it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in order to wax the old-fashioned wooden drawers in my house. They stick unbelievably bad and after using this product it really seemed to loosen them up quite a bit. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s going to be a lot of other uses that I can find for this. The reason I gave this a five star is because you get an entire pound of this wax for a very low price. I only needed about a quarter of the entire pound to wax up all the drawers in my house and I have about 25 of them. I would definitely recommend this to anybody that is looking for a good wax. It&#x27;s a very very hard wax so I&#x27;m sure that it will stay for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been making a lot of homemade lotions this bees wax fits my need perfectly. I like that it comes in a 1lb bar.</li>
    <li> Seems like great wax. I used this on Pierco plastic foundation to coat it so that the bees would be less resistant to drawing on it. Rather than melt the wax, I just held the whole bar and scraped it onto the foundation and it worked perfectly. The bees started tracing immediately along the lines when using this wax to coat the outlines.</li>
    <li> I used this to make lotion bars and they turned out fantastic! I already have this added to my cart to purchase again!</li>
    <li> Good wax I used to melt and coat over a Meerschaum Tobacco Pipe. no problems and ship ok. Will repeat.</li>
    <li> Thank very much. It was perfect. It was Exactly the same as advertised. We used it.&lt;br /&gt;Best regards. Thank you</li>
    <li> The wax didn&#x27;t come in small blocks but rather one big chunk but that&#x27;s fine since I have to grate it anyway. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I used this to make solid perfume.  I found some small black particles in it which were easily picked out. It is fresh and smells great and easy to cut and grate.</li>
    <li> Product will work as I need I&#x27;m sure. It&#x27;s just going to be used with linseed oil and turpentine to treat some axe heads. However the smell is just horrible! Will not be purchasing anymore of these. Item was purchased from two different vendors, both have the same aweful scent.</li>
    <li> Beeswax has so many uses purchasing by the pound makes more sense.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to make homemade lotion bars and could not be more pleased! The quality and the price are perfect for my needs. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I use quite a bit of beeswax in lotions and creams, I like the size, and its a good product, hard to cut for small amounts</li>
    <li> Came as expected, and we use it for making our own lip balm, and body ointment</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the smell of the beeswax and it was hard to color. The final product was satisfactory</li>
    <li> Like that it is unbleached!</li>
    <li> No complaints here, this is some high quality beeswax. Smells fantastic and works great on my didgeridoos. This brick&#x27;s gonna last a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 13 mo. ago.  I use it for making my own salves, and lip balms, lotion.  It goes a long way. I have felt the quality has been really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the \\&quot;block\\&quot; wax over \\&quot;pellets\\&quot; to save money.  After using the product - I can see why buying pellets is easier.  Grating the wax for small recipes is a REAL PAIN.  But I make big batches &#x3D; sooo why was I grating it, when it&#x27;s just melting anyway???  I learned I could just cut the block in half - and let it melt on low - it took a little bit longer - but during that time, I was preping my area etc. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color in the picture does look more gold - my wax is more a light yellow - thank goodness.  I want it more light - so I can tint it pink, and not have to worry about the gold color.  I could care less if it says the word beeswax on it - it&#x27;s being melted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my math equations - but this is what I use for my recipes.  Because I am going to still use the blocks, because it&#x27;s cheaper.  I use a big knife, and cut in half, then cut those in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 lb. brick of wax &#x3D; 16 oz. &#x3D; 32 Tablespoon&lt;br /&gt;¼ of block is 8 Tablespoons // ½ block 16 Tablespoons&lt;br /&gt;{1 oz. &#x3D; 2 Tablespoon}</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with beeswax so I can&#x27;t compare it to another company&#x27;s quality, but I can say that I am very happy with my purchase.  My beeswax smells much like honey, a nice natural smell.  The gold color is lighter than pictured but after looking at many postings, I expected that.  Shipping was super fast - it arrived the next day.  I used it to make lotion for my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  I love the lotion so much I&#x27;m making more as Christmas gifts.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> good amount for the money. Quality appears good. Used for many home products, shave cream, skin cream ect. would buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this for making chapstick and I initially thought it would be bigger. No matter though, a pound is a pound! The beeswax isn&#x27;t as dark yellow as the picture, mine was a light yellow and it didn&#x27;t say beeswax on the block. Also, this is SOOOO hard to try to break up. I actually had to take a screwdriver and hammer to break up the beeswax into chunks. DO NOT USE A CHEESE GRATER. It clogs up your grater and renders it useless. You might as well throw the grater away if you do that, which I actually did. But otherwise it&#x27;s a great product, it&#x27;s just a pain to break it apart.</li>
    <li> A very good price ... i love the smell (smells like honey) ... i have used it for making lotions and creams and it&#x27;s amazing (the best hand cream ever)</li>
    <li> Liked working with this beeswax, to make lotion bars, that turned out great. One pound of beeswax is a lot!</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews and knew the item pictured wasn&#x27;t what I was getting. Didn&#x27;t care about it looking pretty since I was melting it down for lotion. There were some dark flecks in the wax but I expect that from a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;The wax melted nicely, smelled great and gave my lotion the thickness it needed. Would recommend this product to others looking to make natural, organic items.</li>
    <li> This beeswax shipped very quickly.  I was really happy when I opened the package and could smell it through the plastic bag. It smells absolutely amazing. My dad and I kept bee hives when I was a girl and the smell of the wax took me back to fond memories! I cannot wait to make my own lip balm from it!</li>
    <li> Came as a rectangular block weighing in at one pound. Nice golden color with rich aroma. Planning to mix one part beeswax and 3 parts mineral oil for a furniture polish. I have heard about great results but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. More to come after I test it out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this beeswax because the company states that it is organic, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is certified organic. I didn&#x27;t see any kind of certification label on the plastic bag it arrived in. I am using it to make beeswax candles, but I am concerned that it is not true pure beeswax. I recently received beeswax from a local hive at a farmer&#x27;s market and there are huge differences. The color is a much deeper gold than this one which (and the photo is misleading). This beeswax is more like a light cream color. This beeswax smells more waxy and feels stickier than the farmer&#x27;s market one. I am wanting to make beeswax candles so that they burn non-toxic but this will not be helpful if there are added fillers in this wax that are toxic. I am disappointed and will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I used this bees wax to make homemade lotion. It melted great in the crock pot and made wonderful lotion bars.</li>
    <li> I was expecting multiple bars as pictured, but received a large chunk.  I was pleasantly surprised by the nice honey smell.  Other bees wax that I have been around didn&#x27;t really have any noticeable odor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very clean, no impurities or inclusions as far as I can see. Has a nice fragrance to it. I&#x27;m using it for a waterproofing project. Melting it down with turpentine and boiled linseed oil. Should work great!</li>
    <li> This wax is very dark, a light caramel brown. It was probably harvested from the brood frame. it is very good wax, but most people do not want wax this dark for cosmetics, or candles. I found anther company here on Amazon, Larkin Supply, and got the same wax in a very light honey color, for half what this cost me.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff it melts easily in a sauce pan or double boiler. It arrived quickly and in good condition.  I bought it because it is so much cheaper this way than getting pellets.  However, it takes a very long time to grate this up.  You will need a very sturdy grater and it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to get a special one just for the wax.  If you do chose to clean the grater off the only thing I found that worked really well was orange essential oil.</li>
    <li> The beeswax they sent me looks nothing like the beeswax pictured, nor like any beeswax I have ever seen in my life. It has hardly any color to it, it&#x27;s completely anemic. I use it to make my cosmetics, and I&#x27;ve now made two batches, and this stuff has rendered them almost useless. There is no body to it at all, and is clearly cut with some other cheap product - maybe paraffin. It&#x27;s like Minute Rice compared to brown rice.&lt;br /&gt;I am returning my unused portion (which is most of it).</li>
    <li> This beeswax works perfectly for making candles.  So happy that you offered it, as it was alittle hard to find the correct stuff.</li>
    <li> Thought I was re-ordering and ended up with a useless one pound block.  Argh.  Loved this product for ease of use.</li>
    <li> I will be using this beeswax to make lotion, lip balm and candles.  It smells so good and is a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> As described and was perfect for what I was using it for: Covering my bee-frames.  The bees like it too. : )&lt;br /&gt;Will do it again.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> works good for string wax of a bow and I hope to be able to use it for lip balm. i mixed the wax with organic extra virgin olive oil so that it was a bit softer. 2 to 1 ratio.</li>
    <li> I used for lotion bars and it worked great.  In the future I will buy already shaved but I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing at first.</li>
    <li> Hey. Honestly just what can you say about a block of beeswax? It is what it is. I chunk of pure beeswax that I use to lubricate my MasterCracker nut cracker and to wax thread that I use to sew leather with. It does the job that I bought it for, was delivered on time as promised, and is as was described. I&#x27;m happy with it and it will last me until I&#x27;m physically unable to use the things I use it on.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve made lotion and lip gloss from it so far, which smell amazing! It is a big block, much bigger than it looks in the picture. It arrived quickly and was packaged appropriately.</li>
    <li> Perfect product and timely shipping 😊</li>
    <li> it is just as it was listed</li>
    <li> Very clean, we&#x27;ve used it in soap and lip balm, so far, great.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what it said it was. Looks just like the picture. Smells like honey. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for beading.One applies it to the thread.I also used it to protect the edges of handbags.</li>
    <li> nervous to purchase, first timer for beeswax but i think it&#x27;s pretty good. smells like honey and works good in lotion bars i made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will buy the pastilles next time though, thought i would save money buying the big block but i find i dont use it as much because i dont want to deal with the hassle of grating it.</li>
    <li> My husband is very glad he got it.  It is helping him a great deal with his ship</li>
    <li> Arrived as a complete cake minus the embossing.  Appears to be excellent quality.  Will use again.  I use a mini crock pot to make a hand barrier with vitamin E oil about 2:1, just enough oil to make the wax soft enough to apply.</li>
    <li> Very good service on my request of Beeswax. Found it to be of very good quality, very clean and suitable for my project of making Spoon Oil.</li>
    <li> I will recommend this product to everyone, it is top of the line. If any seamstress or taylor need a good beeswax, this is it.</li>
    <li> I really wish it had come in a bar shape. I will have to melt the blob it came as and pour into manageable shapes.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot and for the price it is very good. But if you have ever worked with beeswax like I have it generally has a slight honey sent to it.  This however did not.  It really didn&#x27;t even smell like beeswax.  I am not sure if it had to do with the quality or the flowers the bees were going to I be checking other sources when I need more.</li>
    <li> Well. It&#x27;s cheep bees wax. As advertised. But it has a funky smell. I guess it&#x27;s normal. But I&#x27;ve used other wax that did not have this smell</li>
    <li> Halaleveryday ship the wax and I do not think it came from california valley of pure flowers as stated.  this is deceptive ad.</li>
    <li> Reeked of cigarette smoke! Definitely processed by a heavy cigarette smoker. And don&#x27;t say&lt;br /&gt;that this is the smoke to pacify bees. I came from a smoker family and this is inundated with it.&lt;br /&gt;Nasty!</li>
