      <li>LOVE that</li>
      <li>This stuff is MAGIC.</li>
      <li>Seemed like a better deal than at Walgreens.</li>
      <li>but they stay fresh for a good two weeks that way.  </li>
      <li>think it was Polident that was better.</li>
      <li>When opening the packets most are crumbled.</li>
      <li>It makes a retainer (and I&#x27;m sure everything else</li>
      <li>use this brand for more than five years</li>
      <li>so im pleased.</li>
      <li>And using toothpaste isn&#x27;t any better b/c toothpaste has abrasives in</li>
      <li>And as someone else said, if you don&#x27;t fully rinse, the &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; flavor is an OK side effect.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Efferdent was the most successful, but certainly nothing to praise.</li>
      <li>Plus, they leave my retainer tasting very fresh and minty!  </li>
      <li>These work well and leave a nice, clean fragrance to the bottle.</li>
      <li>and they are nice and clean when I go to sleep.</li>
      <li>About 2 hours of warm water and Efferdent followed by a quick cycle through the wash gets most of the funk out, until I wear them again anyway.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super convenient to just throw them in a cup with warm water and a tablet for cleaning.</li>
      <li>Just as described;very quick nice packaging /no damage.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product to use when you want to clean your water bottle but don&#x27;t have the time to give it a good deep clean!</li>
      <li>Bought this to clean out stank water bottles!</li>
      <li>but it does the job i use it to clean my retainers!</li>
      <li>Clean and disinfected!</li>
      <li>Leaves them nice and fresh.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good quality product.</li>
      <li>As anyone knows, these plastic braces/retainers get easily stained.</li>
      <li>I love being able to head out on a hot-weather motorcycle journey with a sparkling fresh CamelBak.</li>
      <li>My dad turned me on to Efferdent; he uses it on his partials, and when I saw on the box that it can be used to clean retainers, I decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>It cleans up the mineral deposits caked on and makes me feel better about being clean again.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
      <li>this is great, it works great on my retainers and lasts a suuuuper long time since it only needs to be used liked once or twice a month</li>
      <li>Efferdent works great to clean and refresh my clear plastic retainer (like Invisalign).  </li>
      <li>just pop it in a small container &amp; fill with warm water adding product &amp; set for 15 minutes then rense denchers or mouth guard even retainers &amp; its sanitized &amp; good to go!</li>
      <li>The Clean Guard product I liked the best, no soapy feel, no bad taste, retainers stayed clear during entire two week period &amp; was in a convenient tear package.</li>
      <li>I use the tablets as an easy way to clean items that benefit from the soaking / rinse ease.</li>
      <li>Plus these tabs are so cheap you can use them all the time.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than the tablets sold for that purpose, and just as effective.</li>
      <li>Fantastic solution for cleaning water bottles and camelbacks.</li>
      <li>I mainly use these to clean and sanitize my Camelbak, but they are also handy for cleaning teeth bleaching trays, metal water bottles, cleaning jewelry, etc.  </li>
      <li>make sure you use hot water</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> good price. works. very good for mouth guards, etc. use one every day instead of reusing when it comes in bulk at this price</li>
    <li> DONT BUY THE EXPENSIVE TABLETS MADE FOR YOUR BOTTLE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are exactly the same but 1/10th the cost. They work fantastically in the metal bottle I bought the for and in combination with an OXO brush (again, as opposed to the branded, &amp;#34;proprietary&amp;#34; brush for my bottle at triple the cost). For the price I paid for these, one could purchase only 4 tablets &amp;#34;made&amp;#34; for my bottle and these were a 120-count box!!! Do yourself a favor and use these. You won&#x27;t regret it at all.</li>
    <li> good price and product</li>
    <li> Value deal for night guard cleaning. Seemed like a better deal than at Walgreens.</li>
    <li> I heard from other reviews and friends that using these tabs to refresh Sig bottles is a cheap alternative to the Sig tablets.  They were right.</li>
    <li> i guess it doenst do miracles but it does the job i use it to clean my retainers! it does the job</li>
    <li> I got these to clean our large SIGG water bottles and they work great! I drop one tablet in the bottle, fill it with hot water, wait 30 minutes and then rinse it out.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use in my toilet due to hard water build up that was preventing the toilet from flushing at all.  One of these every 3-4 weeks or so and things have been great.  Highly recommended for this purpose!</li>
    <li> I recently started Invisalign and searched the internet for a remedy to help with the odor of the plastic braces. One tip was to put the braces in efferdent and I&#x27;m so glad I tried.  Amazon offers a great price for 120 which will last a while.  Odor problem cured!</li>
    <li> I use these to clean out my work thermos. I make a fresh pot of coffee every single morning with my Chemex and in my Thermos it stays hot and awesome all day long. I needed something that maintained the freshness of my Thermos though without it ruining the awesome flavor of my coffee. These things are perfect along with a long horsehair brush I can easily and effortlessly keep my Thermos perfectly clean without any kind of weird smelly build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a thermos and you haven&#x27;t already bought these to clean it, buy these and make your life easier.</li>
    <li> The tablets seem to be old. When opening the packets most are crumbled.</li>
    <li> Phew! Foams away the musty taste in stainless water bottles. Not just for dentures! Minty freshness can be minimized by leaving cold water in the bottle after cleaning, then dumping minty water after an hour.</li>
    <li> my husband uses this all the time so while I was ordering I ordered it also.</li>
    <li> this is great, it works great on my retainers and lasts a suuuuper long time since it only needs to be used liked once or twice a month</li>
    <li> I use these to clean my Invisalign retainers every morning. I&#x27;ve been through the whole series of move-your-teeth retainers (really, they do what braces do) and am now on the nighttime only retainers that keep my teeth where they were moved to. Invisalign sells you these crystals that are apparently nonabrasive and perfect for Invisalign - but it seems like no matter how much I rinse, I can taste the cleaning crystals when I put the retainers back in my mouth. And they taste terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went looking for something else that wouldn&#x27;t scratch my plastic retainers, but that would taste nice. And this is what I found! Efferdent is minty, doesn&#x27;t harm the clear braces (too-abrasive cleaners make your clear braces turn cloudy, and some flavors/dyes make them turn an ugly yellow or even, god forbid, red!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using the Efferdent, especially as I have the Invisalign crystals to compare it to! They both appear to do a fine job of soaking/cleaning the retainers without causing damage, but the Efferdent leaves the retainer minty and fresh tasting, while the Invisalign crystals...just don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Get this for cleaning your aluminum bottles. The SIGG cleaners are way too expensive, if these are anti-bacterial, these are just as good if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they&#x27;re good enough to clean nasty dentures, then good enough for my bottle. Wash thoroughly though or else you will taste the mint.</li>
    <li> Cleans cups stained with tea or coffee - perfect for bubbling away the grime and softening it so it wipes away.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Works well as a toilet cleaner</li>
    <li> This product works great, but it&#x27;s cheaper to get at Wal Mart. Works great for retainers. It makes a retainer (and I&#x27;m sure everything else it works for) smell good and cleaned, however, you have to soak it for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Works good for retainers.  I&#x27;ve used this for years. I&#x27;m too lazy to brush my mouth retainer from braces as a kid so I just soak them in this and they are nice and clean when I go to sleep.</li>
    <li> I have my own teeth. I had read by another reviewer that she used this for sanitizing things. I took the ball and ran with that one.  LOVE that idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st I used it to clean my make up brushes.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I clean my toothbrush and tongue cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;3.  To clean my electric tea kettle.  If water sits in it bacteria grows and it seems to always have some water left in it.  It cleans up the mineral deposits caked on and makes me feel better about being clean again.&lt;br /&gt;4.  I clean our vaporizer with it.&lt;br /&gt;5. I have polished up jewelry unharmed and does it shine!  Earrings need to be cleaned!&lt;br /&gt;6. I clean my flower vases.  I get fresh flowers often from the farmers market. I love that!! It is bacteria in the water (mostly from rotting leaves) that make the flowers go bad quickly. Tip....add about an inch or even two of bleach to the water!! Sounds like it would kill the flowers quickly but they stay fresh for a good two weeks that way.  I clean the vase after with Efferdent.  I use to just swish water around and call it good but standing water....grows bacteria, as we all know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the list is endless.  I love that is Anti-bacterial!</li>
    <li> So funny story.  My husband wears vibram 5 finer shoes.  And they get stinky.  The best way to clean them is with denture cleaner.  (I know crazy right?)  These tablets work great.  Soak the shoes in a 5 gallon bucket with a couple of these tabs and no more stinky shoes.</li>
    <li> Bought this to clean out stank water bottles! Works super well.</li>
    <li> This is what I use to clean my retainers every day. My dad turned me on to Efferdent; he uses it on his partials, and when I saw on the box that it can be used to clean retainers, I decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It sure beats brushing my retainers b/c believe it or not, cleaning your retainers/dentures/partials with a toothbrush can leave microscopic scratches that are invisible to the naked eye, and those scratches can become breeding grounds for odor-causing bacteria. And using toothpaste isn&#x27;t any better b/c toothpaste has abrasives in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m definitely sticking with Efferdent. I just wish I&#x27;d found out about it when I first got my retainers.</li>
    <li> I just use vinegar now. Its cheaper and works great.</li>
    <li> Got my braces off and needed a retainer cleaner. Tried this out and it seems to clean the retainers well. But I would suggest leaving them in longer than suggested.</li>
    <li> its a white pill you pop pop fizz fizz and look at it bubble and walk away.</li>
    <li> Works great for cleaning my retainers and keeping them fresh.</li>
    <li> Works for its purpose</li>
    <li> I am so glad I read the reviews of this product when I was looking for help in dealing with mineral water stains in my toilets! One tablet tossed into the bowl to dissolve, cleans below the water line completely after 20 - 30 minutes. Wonderful use for this product! Saves me so much time and energy, scrubbing etc. Thanks to all who wrote the information in their reviews of this item. So happy now.</li>
    <li> use this brand for more than five years</li>
    <li> Efferdent works great to clean and refresh my clear plastic retainer (like Invisalign).  These tablets are convenient to use, and each tablet is individually wrapped, so if you are traveling, you can just take a few without having to take the whole box.  Plus, they leave my retainer tasting very fresh and minty!  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Easy- fast and does the job. No fuss or mess.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dentures, but I do have Camelbak water bottles that need cleaning. I&#x27;m not going to spend a fortune on water bottle cleaning tablets when this does the trick! I used to only clean my bottles with soap and water, but they always developed a funky smell after a while. Now I use a tablet 1-2 times a week and my water bottle is so fresh and so clean. This is a great product to use when you want to clean your water bottle but don&#x27;t have the time to give it a good deep clean!</li>
    <li> My husband uses these tablets and they are very effecttive.</li>
    <li> I use these to clean out my reusable water bottles. Leaves them nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> There is another denture cleaner pill  that gives a pleasant odor. This i]s odorless. I purchased it from SghopRite in NJ</li>
    <li> I use the tablets as an easy way to clean items that benefit from the soaking / rinse ease. Toothbrushes, dish brushes..combs an occasional tea or coffee cup....does the trick for me, no mess or fuss. YMMV, but I&#x27;ve used this technique for years with good results and will re-order.</li>
    <li> OKAY - this is a new use. When I see toilet ring developing, I throw in two tablets and it dissolves without scrubbing. New use for these.</li>
    <li> After seeing a bit on the web about their many uses besides dentures, picked up one of these boxes the other day. Coffee pot, break up a tablet &amp; drop it down the Kitchen &amp; Bathroom sink drains, cleaning out a thermos, &amp; it&#x27;s a darn good toilet bowl freshener/cleaner.</li>
    <li> I used the tablets to clean my jewelry, nothing better works on my mini chains and rings than this product !! fantastic, especially for silver jewelry that looks like new after 15 min ..  make sure you use hot water</li>
    <li> No one in my family has dentures, but I buy these tablets to clean out Sigg water bottles and other bottles that aren&#x27;t dishwasher safe. These work well and leave a nice, clean fragrance to the bottle. They do not impart any flavor to your beverage as long as you rinse the bottle well.</li>
    <li> I use it to clean water bottle. Just drop a tablet in the bottle overnight, and it get the job done.</li>
    <li> These are great for cleaning retainers and night guards!</li>
    <li> This Efferdent denture cleaner producr, I have been using for several months and I like it very much.  It works well.</li>
    <li> Perfect and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great product sold exactly as said by seller. i personally use it for my mouth guard. just pop it in a small container &amp; fill with warm water adding product &amp; set for 15 minutes then rense denchers or mouth guard even retainers &amp; its sanitized &amp; good to go!</li>
    <li> Use for refreshing retainers! It really cleaned mine up!</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do</li>
    <li> This stuff is MAGIC. How did it take me so long to hear about this trick?!?!?  I think about the graveyard of old spaghetti-stained Tupperware and drink bottles with some kind of gradoo inside that bit the dust because I could never get it to smell right again, or look right again. That&#x27;s all history, now!!! Fill it up with hot water, drop in a tablet, come back when the water is clear (no longer blue). MAGIC!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dentures but I do have stuff that needs cleaning!</li>
    <li> I have mouth piece for sleep and these do good job cleaning each night  package is a bit hard to open but its fine</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear dentures, but I do use this to clean my Invisalign liners. It&#x27;s super convenient to just throw them in a cup with warm water and a tablet for cleaning. Leaves them fresh and sanitized. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Good stuff, it is what it is and does what it does,  Try it for yourself</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m re-ordering today (only one prtial thus far :).....]</li>
    <li> What can I say about Efferdent? It does the job to clean your retainer.  Just more money to throw down the drain...</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good quality product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cleaning my Osprey hydration pack reservoir. Much cheaper than the tablets sold for that purpose, and just as effective.</li>
    <li> Soaks my dentures every night and they are kept so clean and I highly recommend this product. Well worth the price for it.</li>
    <li> no more store brand for me</li>
    <li> Use this for my invisalign braces to keep them clean and fresh. Very effective.</li>
    <li> Nothing like it for dentures</li>
    <li> It is easy to use especially for seniors like my father just tear off one packet at a time and drop it in the container to soak his dentures</li>
    <li> So, no, I don&#x27;t use them for my teeth.  I use them to clean my SIGG bottles and red wine glasses.  Cleans the bottles nicely.  And as someone else said, if you don&#x27;t fully rinse, the &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; flavor is an OK side effect.  Red wine glasses the next morning are a pain.  I get some hot water, throw a couple of these in each, fill and walk away.  Come back later and rinse and dry and I am done.  Clean and disinfected!</li>
    <li> I still have my teeth, but when I don&#x27;t, I am going to use this product.  Right now I use it for something else, and it performs beautifully. It&#x27;s a good product!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I recently had a partial plate made.  It sure is handy to use.  One of those necessities of life.</li>
    <li> I am 41 years old and don&#x27;t wear dentures. I do, however, avoid harsh chemicals whenever possible around the house, and denture cleaner is amazing to: clean toilets, clean coffee and tea stains out of coffee mugs, freshen up a stainless steel kitchen sink without a ton of elbow grease, clean hard water stains off or out of drinking glasses, clean Sigg bottles and flower vases without bottle brushes, and clean fine jewelry, including sterling silver, gold, platinum, and diamonds without that horrible stinky jewelry cleaner (the last jar I bought from the jewelry store had a warning on it that the state of CA had identified one or more of the ingredients &amp;#34;carcinogenic&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;....OY!). I also wear invisalign invisible braces, and efferdent does make a special gentle formula called &amp;#34;fresh guard&amp;#34; for Invisalign which I also love. Here here for Efferdent - it&#x27;s not just for dentures!</li>
    <li> Although they look and kind of smell like candy, these little tabs are NOT candy. Trust me. But if you use them for their intended purpose they work very well. I use them to clean my night mouth guard and sports guard. Brushing and soaking in mouth wash just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years to clean a retainer. Most recent box was bought at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. I have not purchased through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE: THESE HAVE CHANGED drastically in many ways. The box now has a little picture on it called &amp;#34;Actual Size&amp;#34; - helpful I suppose because they are now slightly smaller in every dimension (the tablets still weigh 2 grams, but you can see and feel that they are thinner and have a slightly smaller circumference). They are also a slightly different shade of blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They now come in white, not dark blue, packets, and most of the time when you separate a packet, it will tear open an adjacent packet, leaving the adjacent tablet exposed to air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tablet itself will usually crumble into 2 to 4 pieces while you tear open its own packet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you drop it in water, the foam that develops has a slightly different bubbly appearance, and after a very few minutes the water will fade to clear rather than only very slowly fading to light blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foam does remain at the top - and, that foam always includes a few dark blue bits of undissolved tablet floating in the foam. These bits will never dissolve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are these as effective as before? Who knows? It&#x27;s a brand new product as far as I can tell, so any history about this product is irrelevant. There is no brand here to be loyal to. Might as well start evaluating all competitive brands, because this has become a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think Bed Bath &amp; Beyond sells &amp;#34;bootleg&amp;#34; products, nor customized versions of OTC brand-name products. So, will the makers of Efferdent step up and respond to my review with an explanation?</li>
    <li> Efferdent cleans my partials really good and I like the idea that I can leave them soak overnite if need be</li>
    <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll order the brand that cleans in 3 minutes.  It seemed to give cleaner, brighter and whiter results.&lt;br /&gt;I think it was Polident that was better.</li>
    <li> works well on partial dentures. It was great for the time I used them and was waiting for my implant process to finish.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my colleague, she likes it, said it&#x27;s good for teeth.And it&#x27;s used very comfortabal.it&#x27;s really helpful.</li>
    <li> Efferdent has been around a long time and you can&#x27;t go wrong buying a proven product. Always works well, every time.</li>
    <li> I have Invisilign retainers. As anyone knows, these plastic braces/retainers get easily stained. I&#x27;ve tried Invisilign&#x27;s own cleaner, Efferdent and Retainer Brite. I&#x27;ve tried each of them at least 5 times. Retainers are the most difficult. They are worn much longer than the 2-week braces, which are constantly replaced until retainers are given. Efferdent was the most successful in cleaning my retainers. Although retainers will eventually discolor due to drink stains and food embedding itself into the plastic. Nothing you can do about that. Replacement Invisilign retainers are expensive. Invisilign&#x27;s own cleaner is worthless and way too expensive. Retainer Brite didn&#x27;t do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Efferdent was the most successful, but certainly nothing to praise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried four cleansers for my clear retainers. 1. Efferdent Fresh Guard which I didn&#x27;t care for at all. It comes loose in little packs that you need sissors to open and it made me cough every time I used it. My clear retainers were noticeably stained after 3 weeks use and it was too expensive at $5.38 for 24. I also didn&#x27;t like that it was soapy (slimey) and tasted bad if not thoroughly rinsed after removing from solution and the blue color stained my towel if I got any on it. 2. Efferdent tablets did a much better job for less money. My retainers were much cleaner, although a little yellow at the end of 3 weeks. I still don&#x27;t like the soapy feel of the solution but there was no bad taste. The small tear packages were easy to use. 3. The Retainer Brite did a good job for less money still. No bad taste, no blue color, just a little foaming but no slimey feel. 4. The Clean Guard product I liked the best, no soapy feel, no bad taste, retainers stayed clear during entire two week period &amp; was in a convenient tear package. Cons: I bought on the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; introductory price and wouldn&#x27;t pay the extra money for their product at the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; price. The packaging is too difficult to get to the product. You need to get a tool to open the vial it comes it and then the stopper mechanism is difficult to open each day when using. I&#x27;d rather have an old fashion screw on lid that I could easily handle.&lt;br /&gt;Of the four, I prefer the Clean Guard, but at their regular price I would opt for the Retainer Brite.</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t have dentures and really can&#x27;t speak on their ability to clean your artificial chompers, but I have a pair of Vibram Five Fingers and have fallen victim of the VFF Funk. I use 2 tablets of Efferdent to soak my VFFs to get the stink out. About 2 hours of warm water and Efferdent followed by a quick cycle through the wash gets most of the funk out, until I wear them again anyway. I would buy Efferdent again if I had a need in the future, seems to work well killing bacteria; last time I&#x27;ll buy a pair of VFFs though.</li>
    <li> I like the tablets, but they came in bad condition.  They were broken, most of them.  Not packed in the box well at all.</li>
    <li> Fantastic solution for cleaning water bottles and camelbacks.</li>
    <li> I use this for Invisalign and it does a good job cleaning. Doesn&#x27;t get everything all the time but a good job and way cheaper than the stuff invisalign sells.</li>
    <li> Using this to clean a SIGG bottle, as others have noted doing.  Seems to work well, get the fizz, rinse, leaves a clean taste in the bottle when i use it.  I trust its doing a good enough job if people trust their fakes and retainers in it...so im pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the Sigg water bottle cleaning pucks were extremely expensive and after some research I found that they were pretty much these tabs but repackaged. I have used these on multiple bottles from BPA free plastic bottles to coated steel bottles and they clean and freshen them up in about 15 mins. Super simple just put in some warm or hot water, drop in a tab and walk away, after about 15 mins or so empty, rinse and then your bottle is fresh, clean and ready to use. Plus these tabs are so cheap you can use them all the time.</li>
    <li> have used for a year and no problem</li>
    <li> After seeing an ad for an expensive bottle cleaner, I was inspired to buy this to clean our stainless steel water bottles. Genius!</li>
    <li> I said how I feel about Efferdent earlier.  I like all of their different tablets I have used except the one containing Listorine.</li>
    <li> good price. works. very good for mouth guards, etc. use one every day instead of reusing when it comes in bulk at this price</li>
    <li> Effective, does a great job</li>
    <li> Easy to use and completely efficient.</li>
    <li> Got it to clean Night Guard, works great.</li>
    <li> These are great to keep around the house.  I mainly use these to clean and sanitize my Camelbak, but they are also handy for cleaning teeth bleaching trays, metal water bottles, cleaning jewelry, etc.  I have even used them to loosen up caked on gunk on my BBQ grill basket.  I read some reviews stating that the expiration date on their boxes had passed, however mine is good until next year.</li>
    <li> would not use any thing else</li>
    <li> Good quality tablets much cheaper in price at Amazon than the regular stores.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for sanitizing my CamelBak hydration system that sits idle in the closet for weeks at a time. I love being able to head out on a hot-weather motorcycle journey with a sparkling fresh CamelBak.</li>
    <li> Efficient cleaning. Good product. It really does the job. Prompt shipment. I do recommend.</li>
    <li> I have my own teeth but I got this when another helpful reviewer responded to my derma roller review by suggesting Efferdent to help dislodge the debris on the skin roller after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found out this versatile product also works for all these other tasks! Who knew! It&#x27;s exciting to discover something inexpensive and easily available is so helpful for cleaning other devices, especially if you don&#x27;t have an autoclave or UV disinfecting device.</li>
    <li> Good product. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Just as described;very quick nice packaging /no damage.  Was exactly what I was looking for to clean my dental appliance.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cleaning my Stainless steel bottles</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for years. They have made the tablet wrapers thinner. They come open in the box now sometimes and the tablet gets broken. I am not pleased.</li>
