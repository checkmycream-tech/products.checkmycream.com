### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I use my electric toothbrush in the morning and this toothbrush at night - works perfect with Colgate toothpaste whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very happy with is brush!</li>
      <li>As a Registered Dental Hygienist (RDH) with 32 years of clinical of experience treating patients with every stage of periodontal issues - I can tell you this is the best &amp;#34;soft bristled toothbrush&amp;#34; I have ever found.</li>
      <li>i am thrilled to have found them!</li>
      <li>This toothbrush has a “ PROTIP” with “17x slimmer bristles” that feel like they do a good job in getting between my teeth and gums.  </li>
      <li>The best toothbrush, good size, gets between your teeth like no other but does not replace flossing.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>but I really love this</li>
      <li>This product is a favorite toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find them in the stores, so ordered them through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like handles in the 80&#x27;s when I was growing up (but more contoured than those were).  </li>
      <li>My favorite brush for years has been the [[ASIN:B003UZTF9E</li>
      <li>With its slender head and flexible handle I can maneuver better.</li>
      <li>Better for your gums.</li>
      <li>This is a great soft, toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>So far it is holding up very nicely and the bristles are till in tact.</li>
      <li>The head is compact, so it is easy to get all the places in your mouth.  </li>
      <li>This gets allllll the plaque off easily.</li>
      <li>I like that the bristles are soft and comfortable, and that the handle has a nice feel in my hand without being so large that I have to shift around for a good place to store it.  </li>
      <li>&#x27;s got a light, flexible handle.  </li>
      <li>toothbrush is alright, but I honestly don&#x27;t like it much.  </li>
      <li>Colgate Slim Soft Pro Tip Toothbrush]] is an excellent choice - easy on the gums and tooth enamel with a handle that fits smaller hands</li>
      <li>because I like the thicker handle, the comfortable bristles, and the clean feeling that I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a nice handle that is easy to grip and soft bristles that clean my teeth and gums but do not hurt my gums.  </li>
      <li>Warming the working end of this with hot water helps soften it even more.</li>
      <li>I love the size and feel I am able to into the back if mouth and teeth in a much better way.</li>
      <li>I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  </li>
      <li>The bristles do a good job getting between my teeth and reaching my back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find these brushes to be much easier on the gums and work better to get between teeth.</li>
      <li>Just go with it and enjoy getting your teeth very tidy between flossing in the hard to reach areas your electric toothbrush might not get as easily.  </li>
      <li>I love this brush, because it is soft, yet effective enough to thoroughly clean your teeth.  </li>
      <li>I agree with other reviewers that these give excellent results, better than the variety of other brushes I have used over the years.  </li>
      <li>They both have Very Soft bristles ideal sensitive teeth and gums - if you brush with force you defeat the purpose of the soft bristle.</li>
      <li>I definitely am glad to replace my old toothbrush with this one.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no nubs on the back of the head, but the head is nice and compact.</li>
      <li>On rare occasions I&#x27;ve found them @ Walmart for $3.69, CVS &amp; Walgreens for $5.49 -</li>
      <li>I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice sleek and slim toothbrush that really gets in between the crevices of your teeth for deep cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll know for sure though if my dentist agrees with me at my next cleaning.</li>
      <li>At first it was one or two, then all the bristles in that hole fell out - and there are a lot in each hole on this model of toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this has happened to me with other soft brushes too, but I did expect a top name brand toothbrush to hold up longer and better than that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The head of the toothbrush is raised, in part, allowing for better access to back teeth which is important to me since I had a root canal on a back tooth.  </li>
      <li>Good product but not soft enough.</li>
      <li>bristles cover a large area</li>
      <li>My first one was provided by my dentist - he highly recommended it.  </li>
      <li>you use it, I think you need to use a gentle touch too, because after using it for one week, the bristles came out in a bunch in my mouth.</li>
      <li>It really gets in between the teeth without tearing up the gums.  </li>
      <li>I love soft bristles, as I had gum grafting done last year to repair receding gums.  </li>
      <li>Colgate does sell other toothbrushes that I do like, with larger handles and more comfortable bristles, but I don&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
      <li>When I ordered the Colgate Slim Soft Pro Tip Toothbrush, I didn’t expect any issues, so when my teeth didn’t feel as clean or fresh as normal after the first use, I thought maybe I did something odd.</li>
      <li>I used this toothbrush for a few weeks before reviewing, because I wanted to make sure I had a real grasp on how it felt after using it day after day.</li>
      <li>This is my second favorite toothbrush next to the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>both have high density number of bristles</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is a soft and gentle toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>bristles are really soft and gentle on your gums as well.</li>
      <li>unique part of this tooth brush is the slimmer bristles and partially raised bristles.  </li>
      <li>I really like that the bristles are soft but not too soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;ONLY the PRO TIP has the raised tip (in blue) for easier access to back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;They both have Floss-Tip bristles for a closer deeper clean at the gum line and between the teeth</li>
      <li>After a week of use, however, I realized that this toothbrush just doesn’t clean as well as other toothbrushes</li>
      <li>Otherwise, this toothbrush feels cheap relative to other modern brushes.</li>
      <li>Very soft bristles - softer than toothbrushes marked &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>If you are heavy handed with toothpaste like I am then most of the toothpaste will fall off because the head of the toothbrush is not very wide.</li>
      <li>It clearly states that this does not replace flossing so continue to do so after brushing.</li>
      <li>I tried both the &amp;#34;Slim Soft Pro Tip&amp;#34; Toothbrush and the &amp;#34;Slim Soft Gliding Tips&amp;#34; Toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Seemed like a big gimmick to me, but to my surprise, it really did work.  </li>
      <li>The Colgate Slim Soft toothbrush may have solved this problem.</li>
      <li>Slim is the best darn toothbrush on Planet Earth in 2015!&amp;#34; Only one problem - they are difficult for the average consumer to find for purchase -</li>
      <li>B000OLE7PO Colgate 360 Degree Sensitive Toothbrush, Extra Soft, Compact 34, 1 Toothbrush, (Case of 6)]].  </li>
      <li>If you want a soft brush, I would recommend instead the Colgate 360 Extra Soft.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what these bristles are 17x slimmer than, but they feel exactly the same as every other soft toothbrush I have every used.</li>
      <li>Very durable and long lasting.</li>
      <li>I was already using a compact, soft bristle brush but still had problems reaching a troublesome area in the back of my mouth.</li>
      <li>They seems to poke into the gum line and were kind of uncomfortable.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d only use a brush like this if I had a problem and needed a very soft brush and was willing to use a very slow, gentle touch when brushing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are thin, yet strong, and they work well at getting between teeth.  </li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t like other toothbrushes.</li>

    <li> Experts say that you should change out your toothbrush every three months whether it appears to need it or not - and also after you&#x27;ve had a cold, the flu or a strep infection.  Germs can hide in those bristles.  The [[ASIN:B00E9PPGTM Colgate Slim Soft Pro Tip Toothbrush]] is an excellent choice - easy on the gums and tooth enamel with a handle that fits smaller hands well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended</li>

    <li> The bristles on this toothbrush are extra-slim to get between teeth the way floss does.  Seemed like a big gimmick to me, but to my surprise, it really did work.  No, it doesn&#x27;t replace actually flossing (I&#x27;m a flossing queen!), but it will help some if you&#x27;re lazy in your flossing habits.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes were recommended to me by our dental hygienist.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find them in the stores, so ordered them through Amazon.

    <li> I love the size and feel I am able to into the back if mouth and teeth in a much better way. I am very happy with is brush!</li>
    <li> They seem to work as well as my previous brushes.  I like that the bristles are soft and comfortable, and that the handle has a nice feel in my hand without being so large that I have to shift around for a good place to store it.  On the other hand, I had hoped that the surface area would be larger.  In my view, the head is unreasonable slender.</li>

    <li> The best toothbrush, good size, gets between your teeth like no other but does not replace flossing.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I used this toothbrush for a few weeks before reviewing, because I wanted to make sure I had a real grasp on how it felt after using it day after day. I have a smaller mouth, so this toothbrush scared me a bit to start with - it&#x27;s more of a medium surface brush than a small (and my dentist always gives me a small) but I really love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles cover a large area but I don&#x27;t feel overwhelmed while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth. I really like that the bristles are soft but not too soft. I definitely am glad to replace my old toothbrush with this one.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is a soft and gentle toothbrush.  The bristles are very thin and it is very soft.  It has a lot of bristles, and it has a tilted head.&lt;br /&gt;When you use it, I think you need to use a gentle touch too, because after using it for one week, the bristles came out in a bunch in my mouth. At first it was one or two, then all the bristles in that hole fell out - and there are a lot in each hole on this model of toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not a gentle brusher- I go at it with a vengeance-  and this has happened to me with other soft brushes too, but I did expect a top name brand toothbrush to hold up longer and better than that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d only use a brush like this if I had a problem and needed a very soft brush and was willing to use a very slow, gentle touch when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a light, flexible handle.  There&#x27;s no nubs on the back of the head, but the head is nice and compact.</li>
    <li> I was already using a compact, soft bristle brush but still had problems reaching a troublesome area in the back of my mouth. The Colgate Slim Soft toothbrush may have solved this problem. With its slender head and flexible handle I can maneuver better. I know it is working because in the past I needed to floss the problem tooth several times to get it clean, but now there is little trapped debris left to remove. The slimmer bristles make the difference. I&#x27;ll know for sure though if my dentist agrees with me at my next cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is a great soft, toothbrush.  It really gets in between the teeth without tearing up the gums.  I will be buying this toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> Good product but not soft enough.</li>
    <li> This product is a favorite toothbrush. The slimness of the tip allows reaching into the deepest crevices for deep cleaning while the softness of the bristles guards against enamel removal.</li>
    <li> This gets allllll the plaque off easily. After brushing, my teeth feels as if I just flossed them, but without all the effort. Every now and then I would floss after brushing and there&#x27;s nothing left for the floss to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did feel a bit weird the first week or two, because the bristles got into places where my gums weren&#x27;t used to. I&#x27;ve been using these for close to a year now and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love soft bristles, as I had gum grafting done last year to repair receding gums.  Brushing with bristles that are too hard, damage your gums.  I love this brush, because it is soft, yet effective enough to thoroughly clean your teeth.  The head is compact, so it is easy to get all the places in your mouth.  These bristles remind me a little of paintbrush bristles.  They are thin, yet strong, and they work well at getting between teeth.  This is my second favorite toothbrush next to the [[ASIN:B000OLE7PO Colgate 360 Degree Sensitive Toothbrush, Extra Soft, Compact 34, 1 Toothbrush, (Case of 6)]].  Give it a try, you might be switching permanently!</li>
    <li> I use an electric toothbrush in the mornings, but I use a manual brush at work after lunch and in the evenings at home.  My favorite brush for years has been the [[ASIN:B003UZTF9E Oral-B Pro-Health All-In-One Toothbrush]] because I like the thicker handle, the comfortable bristles, and the clean feeling that I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is alright, but I honestly don&#x27;t like it much.  The handle is quite thin by today&#x27;s standards.  It&#x27;s like handles in the 80&#x27;s when I was growing up (but more contoured than those were).  I find it uncomfortable to hold.  Also, the slimmer bristles that are the selling point of this toothbrush bothered my gums.  They seems to poke into the gum line and were kind of uncomfortable.  My teeth didn&#x27;t feel especially cleaner after using this compared to my Oral B manual brush, either.  Colgate does sell other toothbrushes that I do like, with larger handles and more comfortable bristles, but I don&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
    <li> When I ordered the Colgate Slim Soft Pro Tip Toothbrush, I didn’t expect any issues, so when my teeth didn’t feel as clean or fresh as normal after the first use, I thought maybe I did something odd. After a week of use, however, I realized that this toothbrush just doesn’t clean as well as other toothbrushes I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing with the same toothpaste using either my plain Oral B toothbrush or my sonic toothbrush produces vastly improved results over the Colgate toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush has been relegated to the household cleaning supplies. I won’t use it to brush my teeth again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice sleek and slim toothbrush that really gets in between the crevices of your teeth for deep cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are really soft and gentle on your gums as well. If you are heavy handed with toothpaste like I am then most of the toothpaste will fall off because the head of the toothbrush is not very wide. So far it is holding up very nicely and the bristles are till in tact. Very durable and long lasting. It clearly states that this does not replace flossing so continue to do so after brushing.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t like other toothbrushes. I find these brushes to be much easier on the gums and work better to get between teeth. Warming the working end of this with hot water helps soften it even more.</li>
    <li> As a Registered Dental Hygienist (RDH) with 32 years of clinical of experience treating patients with every stage of periodontal issues - I can tell you this is the best &amp;#34;soft bristled toothbrush&amp;#34; I have ever found. Colgate sent me a dozen samples to try over a year ago and they sat on my desk at home unopened for about 3 months -  I finally opened one and tossed the box into the trash can... as soon as I felt the bristles wiggle between my teeth into the &amp;#34;sulcus&amp;#34; where germs breed in the human mouth I totally flipped out! I retrieved the box to read about the &amp;#34;floss tip technology&amp;#34; and folks - I can tell you with supreme confidence, &amp;#34;The Colgate 17x Slim is the best darn toothbrush on Planet Earth in 2015!&amp;#34; Only one problem - they are difficult for the average consumer to find for purchase - On rare occasions I&#x27;ve found them @ Walmart for $3.69, CVS &amp; Walgreens for $5.49 -</li>
