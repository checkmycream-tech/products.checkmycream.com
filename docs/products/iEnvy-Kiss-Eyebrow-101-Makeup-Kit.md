<li> You really have to apply it carefully.</li>
<li> I finally threw my old one out.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
<li> There was an error in my packaging, as the kit should come with 4 stencils including: Delicate, Sexy, Natural, and Dramatic.</li>
<li> stencils are reusable and the material is durable once you take your time and store them flat carefully, they should last a very long</li>
<li> My kit was missing the Natural stencil, and came with 2 Delicates instead.</li>
<li> For some reason other stencils are too long.</li>
<li> you have to use sparingly or its to dark</li>
<li> I have dark brown hair and brown eyebrows but both colors are way too dark.</li>
<li> Only problem is the angled brush that it comes with is a bit thick for my liking.</li>
<li> Also, colors are very dark, if you are a blond on lighter color hair - you will want to purchase a lighter brow color to add to what is included in this order.</li>
<li> I use it everyday.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not easy.</li>
<li> The stencils are a bit hard to use, but that could just be because of my lacking skills.</li>
<li> The powder had broken up and was all gone.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult to use with one hand</li>

    <li> it works great but color way to dark</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast. I was satisfied with the product. No problems. Love it</li>
    <li> I !iked them very much</li>
    <li> This product is NOT for AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN.  It looks like i put cigarette ashes on my eyebrows...and yes, I was using the darkest shade</li>

    <li> Very good product. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;The stencils are reusable and the material is durable once you take your time and store them flat carefully, they should last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;The stencils can even be used a makeup teaching tool.</li>
    <li> wish one of the stencils was thinner - they are all very large.  Also, colors are very dark, if you are a blond on lighter color hair - you will want to purchase a lighter brow color to add to what is included in this order.</li>
    <li> Bought these, the elf stencils and some other ones and I like these the best. For some reason other stencils are too long. These are just right! Love them and the highlight and shades are nice too. Perfect for my dark eyebrows.</li>
    <li> If your a dark-skinned person here&#x27;s the eyebrow kit for you. I use it everyday. Lots of different stencils to chose from. If done properly, you will not get that drawn on look like I see from most people that use just a pencil. Only problem is the angled brush that it comes with is a bit thick for my liking. But not a problem, I just use my own.</li>
    <li> Yes, It work. Practice makes perfect</li>
    <li> I just loved it, it&#x27;s just applying my eyebrow is getting more easier and easier. I used the delicate or sexy and it&#x27;s really fun and I&#x27;m getting compliments.</li>
    <li> I had an eyebrow kit from Avon that I bought about 17 years ago. The powder had broken up and was all gone. I could not throw it away, but this has been a great replacement. I finally threw my old one out.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is perfect for my brows.</li>
    <li> The colors are quite dark, so if you&#x27;re blonde or light brunette you might want to go with another kit.

    <li> Easy to use, but would prefer having a stencil that sticks to your face though, but overall I&#x27;d recommend it :)</li>
