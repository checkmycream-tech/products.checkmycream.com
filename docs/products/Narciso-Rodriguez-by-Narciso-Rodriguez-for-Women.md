      <li>It smells a little more masculine then feminine.</li>

    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but the smaller bottle doesn&#x27;t really smell the same. This is my favorite fragrance and I bought this smaller one to take to the gym each day but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go with the smaller again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and always get complements on it.  The scent in this botttle is very weak.  Could it be old?</li>

    <li> I had fell in love with this fragrance from a neighbor having wore it. When I put it on me it did smell the same sexy,seductive way in which it smelled on her. It smells a little more masculine then feminine. I use it to spray my bedsheets.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the fragrance on me.  I received several compliments on this perfume. My only issue is it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on long.</li>
    <li> When Arsenio Hall said Tarji P Henson smelled good, and she said it was Narciso Rodriguez For Her....I knew I had to try it!! It was ridiculously priced at Macy&#x27;s so I went the Amazon route. My product arrived in 3 days and it smelled fantastic!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance right now, it&#x27;s sophisticated and soft. It&#x27;s an understated fragrance that you have to get up close to smell so it&#x27;s a special treat for anyone allowed to get that close :-)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume. I&#x27;m a perfume junkie. I own Flowerbomb, Acqua di Gioia, Gucci Envy Me, Burberry Brit, etc. but this is my FAVORITE. It truly is a your-skin-but-better scent. VERY sexy, my boyfriend cannot get enough of it! It&#x27;s perfect for the holidays too. If you&#x27;re looking for a warm yet sexy scent, this your go-to. Also the price is better on Amazon so kudos!</li>

And this makes me love it even more. It is UNIQUE where I am from....not like the burberry that everybody knows. etc Just yesterday I was at the airport and the guy at security was like what is it you&#x27;re wearing...and when I told him he had a big smile....so I know.</li>
    <li> This is a sophisticated and mysterious perfume.  The eau de toilette is a concentrated fragrance that lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and unbroken.  Love the scent, love the feel.  Also convenient to get it this way, as I didn&#x27;t recall where I got the free samples that made me want more.</li>
