      <li>That might have caused it to not adhere good enough.</li>

      <li>If you are looking for a true, deep blue then this is it.  </li>
      <li>In most light, you can clearly see that it is a blue color, but from far away it can appear black (like when I wear it on my toes, it sometimes looks like a black polish).</li>

    <li> This polish was really pretty.  I bought it as a gift for a girl who had been looking for a dark blue color -- she loved it.  It has a nice shimmer to it.  It was very well packaged -- I bought another OPI polish that looked like it might have been used before, but this one was perfect.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheap, new nail polish to try and decided on this color. I did not expect to be this pleased with the result.  Yoga-ta Get This Blue is a deep, navy blue.  I was expecting a regular navy, but when I saw this polish in the sunlight, it has a certain shimmer to it which was unexpected and very attractive.  It also stays put.  My job is very hard on nail polish, but this stuff has remained almost chip free.  I will definitely be buying from OPI again soon.</li>
    <li> &#x27;Yoga-ta Get This Blue!&#x27; is a very deep cobalt blue. The image shows it much lighter than it actually is. It dries to a very shiny creme consistency. It applied very smoothly and only took two coats for full opacity. I love it!</li>
    <li> The color is accurate, appearing just like the picture.  It went on very smoothly, even without a lot on the brush.  It is also durable, holding up well.  We&#x27;re on day 5 now with only a slight chip.  I&#x27;m rather rough on my nails and I often have to retouch them, so I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have dark asian skin. This color didn&#x27;t really pop that much on my skin tone. Looks great on the fair skinned model though!</li>
    <li> I love the color of this nail polish. I tried it and it chipped very easily. I treated my cuticles with oil just before I put it on. That might have caused it to not adhere good enough. I will try again. I love the color soooo much.</li>
    <li> Looking for a dark nail polish but don&#x27;t like black? Try Yoga-ta Get This Blue; it&#x27;s a navy blue colour with a slight shimmer from OPI&#x27;s India collection. I love black nail polish on SOME people but if you&#x27;re even slightly pale (like me) then you risk looking like a goth or an EMO (or whatever they&#x27;re called these days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yoga-ta Get This Blue is flattering with any skin colour, nail style and length and is SUPER easy to apply.  One coat would be enough but out of habit I always apply two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my review of Yoga-ta Get This Blue here: [...]&lt;br /&gt;Visit Lipstick &amp; Cake for more OPI reviews [...]</li>
    <li> Once I saw this color, knew I had to have it. Absolutely great navy blue. Very powerful looking. The photo ad shows the color very well. It is a must have for year round color choice. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this nail polish. I painted my fingernails the day I got it and a week later; took the red paint off my toenails to paint it this color. It&#x27;s an excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone. OPI is excellent; they don&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous deep navy color, beautifully saturated, easy to apply and lasts the longest for me without chipping.  I&#x27;m an OPI junkie.</li>
    <li> this product arrived on time and is a high quality brand, opi, which i highly recommend.  you can&#x27;t beat opi.  it won&#x27;t chip on the next day of application.  i swear by it.  skip china glaze.  useless.</li>
    <li> Anyone who has used OPI nail lacquer in the past is most likely still using their product faithfully. Rich colors, great coverage, superior strength, and amazing durability are the reasons that OPI is the only way to go when you want to polish your nails! Additionally, this is the BEST deep, dark blue color! It&#x27;s the only color I wear now on my nails, and I always get compliments on it as well. If you can stomach the silly name, &#x27;Yoga-Ta Get This Blue&#x27; is the finest not-too-wacky yet not-too-tame color out there!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish. O.P.I. is my favorite brand, it&#x27;s stays on for so long before chipping it&#x27;s great! I don&#x27;t wear any other brand. This color is the perfect blue. I&#x27;ve had many compliments.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a true, deep blue then this is it.  No hit of purple, not indigo, not greenish or greyish.  It is BLUE, a perfect jewel tone.  I absolutely love it and it&#x27;s one of my favorite shades.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color. It&#x27;s a little darker than I was expecting it to be. In most light, you can clearly see that it is a blue color, but from far away it can appear black (like when I wear it on my toes, it sometimes looks like a black polish). But still a very good color. I like putting a glitter polish over it.</li>
    <li> Polish arrived on time as expected, in great quality and the colour&#x27;s so beautiful! The dark colour is great for going out at night and looks exactly as pictured! Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> 5 stars, for as I said that this is the only nail polish&lt;br /&gt;that I purchase.&lt;br /&gt;yes, i would tell you to buy</li>
    <li> I got this color in hope that I would FINALLY find a good dark blue that was just straight one color. Yoga-ta get this blue is FANTASTIC. it has great coverate, awesoeme durability, and it looks great. no \\&quot;hints\\&quot; of other colors. I am just so pleased with it. After I wore it for the first time, 5 of my friends have gone and purchased it as well.</li>
    <li> They should of named this dodger blue so one night we were going to a dodger game and I wanted to do my nails so I boufht this color worjs great and when I recieved it, it was not old or anything.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a family member who loves color!  Fingernail polish from OPI is always a pleasure to receive.  The color selection, quality and glow they have are BIG a big plus with this product.  It is a product you can rely on!</li>
