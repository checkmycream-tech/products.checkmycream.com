    <li> You can actually feel it working on your scalp. I have notice a noticeable difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> MUST HAVE...If you have been looking for the cure to growing longer, healthier, thicker hair this product is it!!!  In just one month, my hair is thicker than it&#x27;s ever been, and has grown at least 2 inches long.  The smell is not as bad as described by others.  It def wears off within a few hours.  The tingling sensation feels absolurtely wonderful as it stimulates the scalp.  I applied daily which is whay I beleive my results came faster.  The tube cracked in several places once I started using, causing the cream to spill out all over the place.  I ended up squeezing the cream into a empty jar that I had to avoid the tube and that solves my problem.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this wonder in a tube!  I recently ordered two more tubes, and will not be found without this staple for my hair.</li>

    <li> Not a fan of the smell but it may help I need more time to see a real difference</li>
    <li> This is good grease been using it for 14 years it grows your very fast .</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the one I wanted then when I try getting the one I wanted and paid more money for one instead of getting two, they send me this one again,  this works good but the other one works better... In other words, it was my fault for buyi</li>
    <li> The package that I recieved had a different look same colors but was not the same as what I recieved and instead of 150g that was showed on the ordered I recieved 125g.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, after washing my hair, and only on my scalp, but it do use my detangling brush to help stimulate my scalp. I really like this product, it really moisturizes my scalp and my hair is softer since using it. This is a must have for my hair care arsenal.</li>
    <li> The package came in damaged, so there&#x27;s quite a few places the ointment seeps out of. The smell is very strong due to the sulphur. It does make my hair considerably softer and there is less breakage. As far as helping it grow, the jury is still out. Also, there has been some confusion on how it should be used. It says on the label everyday, but other reviews have said every other day, or only after washing hair.</li>
