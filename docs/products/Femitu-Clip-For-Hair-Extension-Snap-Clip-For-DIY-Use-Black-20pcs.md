      <li>These are great!</li>
      <li>These are just perfect for sewing on to weaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>CLIPS ARE JUST AS ADVERTISED, LOVED THEM!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Great clips for some diy projects,</li>
      <li>These are good clips, but not for everyone...</li>
      <li>The clips are great for making clip ins.they do not snag my hair and arent made cheap,you know how cheap clips snap or snag</li>
      <li>They work perfectly and came fast.</li>
      <li>Good for use,my friend love to use it</li>
      <li>Yes they was wonderful came before two weeks early</li>
      <li>I have very fine, curly hair, and the clips didn&#x27;t stay no matter what I did.</li>
      <li>Nice clips that work well and stay securely in the hair.  </li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>they work ok</li>
      <li>but besides that great product, really sturdy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great for caps, and for weaving, but make sure that you have the hair for it.  </li>
      <li>Overall, the best deal I&#x27;ve ever got on clips &amp; they seem pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>I like the clips they seem to be secure.</li>
      <li>They came early an are a good size.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s why I made it 4stars, as I prefer my combs teeth to be more straight.</li>
      <li>These are good , the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I used these to make some clip ins</li>
      <li>Not the same as pictured here - kinda deceiving, very dispappointed - seller shipped have shorter and connected combs, unlike this one where combs are longer and separated for better grab or attachment to own hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth buying for hair extensions and hair pieces.</li>
      <li>however, they seem to be fairly good clips, just not what I expected.</li>
      <li>but they seem pretty good like any other hair clip.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i suggest sewing two sets of hair together first before attaching clips.  </li>
      <li>Good ones but hard to clip it to your hair</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>and I had to toss one snap clip due to rust, but there are better that the ones u can buy from sallys</li>
      <li>there are so many types of clips, why post a photo of clips that are not exactly like the ones we will be receiving.</li>
      <li>The only thing that is challenging is that the smaller clip you go remember that you have to have a needle that fits through the holes.</li>

    <li> does what it supposed to</li>
    <li> I like these. Your standard hair extension clip. If you have tried these at Sally&#x27;s then they are literally the same.I made some clip in&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been wearing for almost half a year and have seen nothing wrong with these. As expected. The only thing that is challenging is that the smaller clip you go remember that you have to have a needle that fits through the holes. I purchased a needle and it was too big. I ended up buying a variety pack of sewing needles for like $1.99 at my local beauty supply. Problem solved.</li>
    <li> Nice clips that work well and stay securely in the hair.  It&#x27;s worth buying for hair extensions and hair pieces.</li>
    <li> the clip did their job as I sew it on the extentions I wore. the hold to should be bigger</li>
    <li> Good for use,my friend love to use it</li>
    <li> I was expecting to receive clips that look like the clips in the photo. there are so many types of clips, why post a photo of clips that are not exactly like the ones we will be receiving. I ordered the hair clips in a size large but they seem to be quite small and I cannot get the needle through any of the holes.. I can only imagine what the medium and small size clips look like.. they will probably only hold about 28 strands of hair.jk . anywho, I actually read today where the large size clips was supposed to be 3 ounces in the medium and small size clips were  4 ounces.. Kinda confused. however, they seem to be fairly good clips, just not what I expected. ps. don&#x27;t be in a rush to get them.</li>
    <li> Too small and does not hold.  What a waste.</li>
    <li> they work if u have thin hair, not natural hair. they work ok but it&#x27;s hard for me to clip them in. Wouldn&#x27;t order them again</li>
    <li> Some were a bit bent out of shape...so that&#x27;s why I made it 4stars, as I prefer my combs teeth to be more straight. Overall, the best deal I&#x27;ve ever got on clips &amp; they seem pretty sturdy. Thanks.</li>
    <li> These are good , the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I used these to make some clip ins and I dyed the hair and the snap clips rusted when the hair color got on them Iittle and I had to toss one snap clip due to rust, but there are better that the ones u can buy from sallys</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! I ordered the same item from someone else and I never received it. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works like I expected.</li>
    <li> CLIPS ARE JUST AS ADVERTISED, LOVED THEM!</li>
    <li> I like the clips they seem to be secure. But smaller than I thought. Did take quiet a long time for shipping.</li>
    <li> These are good clips, but not for everyone...unfortunately I&#x27;m one of those people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for caps, and for weaving, but make sure that you have the hair for it.  I have very fine, curly hair, and the clips didn&#x27;t stay no matter what I did.</li>
    <li> These are just perfect for sewing on to weaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i suggest sewing two sets of hair together first before attaching clips.  Makes them fuller!</li>
    <li> Slipped out of hair numerous times.</li>
    <li> Good ones but hard to clip it to your hair</li>
    <li> Yes they was wonderful came before two weeks early</li>
    <li> The clips are great for making clip ins.they do not snag my hair and arent made cheap,you know how cheap clips snap or snag</li>
    <li> Some of the holes were a bit hard to get the needle through but besides that great product, really sturdy.</li>
    <li> Too entirely too long to get to me. Havent used them yet but they seem pretty good like any other hair clip. I do like there is room for a triple track</li>
    <li> Great clips for some diy projects,</li>
    <li> These are great! They work perfectly and came fast. They are so much more expensive at the beauty store. Save yourself some dough and go with these.</li>
    <li> Not the same as pictured here - kinda deceiving, very dispappointed - seller shipped have shorter and connected combs, unlike this one where combs are longer and separated for better grab or attachment to own hair.</li>
    <li> Love them. They came early an are a good size.</li>
