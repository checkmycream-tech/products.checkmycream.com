      <li>and I have built many of my own over the years.</li>

      <li>but it seems very smooth.  </li>
      <li>I am in absolute love with this gun it is lightweight, easy to use, easy to set ,so quite and best of all the price</li>
      <li>Perfect for lining and used it last night for shading.</li>
      <li>I have a suitcase that is lined with padding on the top, bottom, and sides, and when my machines are in this case they do not move around.</li>
      <li>so I could get a better feel for it.</li>
      <li>I am a scratcher but from all the different machines i have used, this rotary geys the ink in the best</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve still yet to make it run more than 5 seconds.</li>
      <li>Pretty Impressed with this rotary being the first one I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
      <li>I like the plug and play part most about this machine.  </li>
      <li>Works good for the first rotary I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t to sure on this gun purchase, for its my first rotary always used coil machines but machine is amazing its quit super smooth.</li>
      <li>I can buy 50 of these versus another company selling basically the same machine for 675$. Very Light weight and runs good.</li>
      <li>it is light</li>
      <li>CHEAPLY MADE DO NOT BUY</li>
      <li>so cheap you could just throw it away..</li>
      <li>They run fantastic.</li>
      <li>Order: tattoo gun for my cousin he loves it and says it is light weight</li>
      <li>Delivered on time, runs great, quiet and lightweight machine.</li>
      <li>and the cheap price for the market right now ok.</li>
      <li>So I think for a beginner it might be a good idea to run a Rotary machine till you can get a steady hand and get your depth right.</li>
      <li>Works great super quiet</li>
      <li>It only looks nice and is very light</li>
      <li>Its sweet.</li>
      <li>This little Machine is super light and runs great.</li>
      <li>the vice threads were super glued onto the knob</li>
      <li>used it on practice skin, works well, very powerful and most of all light and silent.</li>
      <li>overall it is a good starter machine for my first rotary</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great little machine, and</li>
      <li>i thought it would be better but its made kinda cheap like the adjuster on tyhe back doesnt adjust anything</li>
      <li>Its light and easy to work with more control much better for tattooing neat and not as heavy as the normal tattoo gun</li>
      <li>Got it out of the box, and used it right away without having to adjust anything.</li>
      <li>only i think it didnt go through, but this machine is very light weight just like a prison tat machine...</li>
      <li>Cuz, that&#x27;s exactly where this thing belongs.</li>
      <li>I love how the machine runs, how lightweight it is, and how quiet it is.</li>
      <li>i had to run it at a higher rate then im used to  </li>
      <li>BURNED MOTOR DURING FIRST EVER USE.  </li>
      <li>spring clip terminals are solid and easy to work on and change out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>is nice as you do not need a rubber band to hold the needle in place, however if you tighten too much it will bog the gun down</li>
      <li>Your money would be better spent by throwing the cost of this machine straight in the trash.</li>
      <li>Once tuned it was ready.</li>
      <li>I am buying a real bearing swivel for the drive shaft.</li>
      <li>but i really like the style</li>
      <li>As I was getting ready to do another tattoo on somebody, I pulled this machine out</li>
      <li>Good machine, I been using it for almost a year, but ordered a blue one and got a black one</li>
      <li>SUPER LOW VOLTAGE.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend  this product</li>
      <li>Its no cheyenne but pretty much the same idea.</li>
      <li>any real use.&lt;br /&gt;The tensioner on top is for looks only and serves no real purpose on the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its completely different from coil machines, but for the price its worth buying to see what the rotary fuzz is all about.</li>
      <li>After this it will be an entirely new machine.</li>
      <li>I just knew that its going to be a new sheriff in town,</li>
      <li>/&gt; The tube clamp is solid and holds very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this product was complete garbage do not waste your money</li>
      <li>Complete turd.</li>
      <li>What I was not satisfied about was that I was only able to use the machine once before it broke.</li>
      <li>frame is solid, one piece and decently made.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>it works really well.. not loud at all</li>
      <li>O.o</li>
      <li>Manufacturing connecting rod and slide block out of hardwood or possibly some natural water buffalo horn.</li>

<li> Manufacturing connecting rod and slide block out of hardwood or possibly some natural water buffalo horn.</li>
<li> &gt; The motor and slide come out easily with just a few small counter sunk</li>
<li> Have only done a few tats with it so far</li>
<li> Only downside is the plastic tension set up, but it is a knock off, so expect less quality in parts.&lt;br</li>
<li> it is a metal pin rotating with as little friction as possible with this setup.&lt;br</li>
<li> Thought I would get my feet wet with rotary with this machine.</li>
<li> They came in the mail sooner than expected too  </li>
<li> the bad thing bout it all is I was working on a customer when this thing had a mine of its own and just didnt wanted to go no more.</li>
<li> EXTREME KNOCKOFF</li>
<li> the are down for gun to work</li>
<li> not what I expected!!</li>
<li> I just started Tattooing and found that the other guns are a bit heavy and they vibrate like hell...</li>
<li> the heal time less trauma and</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve literally insulated every electrical component and the body with black electrical tape and it still shorts out my power supply every time I plug it in.</li>
<li> It is a little hoppy compared to a coil machine.</li>
<li> Takes a little practice just as any thing to tweak it to your specs....</li>
<li> trouble with motor or anything else as of yet.</li>
<li> After examining the machine, I noticed that the plastic nipple that you put your gromlet and opposite side of the needle, had broken off.</li>
<li> very cheap materials, hard to adjust, and just a horrible piece of equipment.</li>
<li> I feel that this is not a very good tattoo machine it was broken does not hold a tube</li>
<li> Total piece of crap.</li>
<li> NOT GOOD..!</li>
<li> but unfortunately it wasnt going to be me</li>

    <li> very cheap materials, hard to adjust, and just a horrible piece of equipment. It only looks nice and is very light but I will not recommend it for its looks!</li>
    <li> used it on practice skin, works well, very powerful and most of all light and silent. Its completely different from coil machines, but for the price its worth buying to see what the rotary fuzz is all about. Its no cheyenne but pretty much the same idea.</li>
    <li> Order: tattoo gun for my cousin he loves it and says it is light weight he has no problem with it and been doing tattoo ever since he got it he recommends to all tattoo artist out there</li>
    <li> overall it is a good starter machine for my first rotary it gets the job done and it still runs after about 15 tattoos or so, I don&#x27;t like the flimsiness of the turn adjustment in the back it feels like it is gonna break every time I stick the alan wrench in there.</li>
    <li> Excelent! Fully recomended</li>
    <li> this machine is good looking and works good. I had already wrote a review about this one only i think it didnt go through, but this machine is very light weight just like a prison tat machine... You do have to know how to use a homemade machine in order to use this machine...</li>
    <li> not what I expected!!</li>
    <li> I do not like this one and will never use it on anyone again.  This will just be used for show</li>
    <li> Its light and easy to work with more control much better for tattooing neat and not as heavy as the normal tattoo gun</li>
    <li> I love these! They run fantastic. They came in the mail sooner than expected too  I highly recommend  this product</li>
    <li> When I frist seen this machine I just knew that its going to be a new sheriff in town, but unfortunately it wasnt going to be me cause after bout a couple of days of using this machine, it just stop on me.and the bad thing bout it all is I was working on a customer when this thing had a mine of its own and just didnt wanted to go no more. I lost with this. NOT GOOD..! LOL</li>
    <li> Zero stars this product was complete garbage do not waste your money couldnt even use it once.. the vice threads were super glued onto the knob it wouldnt even come close to snugging the tube ..DO NOT BUT !! amazon said they would call in two business days I&#x27;ve sent multiple emails not one peep its been two weeks ..I almost lost a client when he saw this piece of sh!+ fall apart in front of him ...GARBAGE ...AND HORRIBLE SELLER......this blows I have to put one star O.o</li>
    <li> Pretty Impressed with this rotary being the first one I&#x27;ve owned.  I like the plug and play part most about this machine.  Have only done a few tats with it so far but it seems very smooth.  Great product, manufactured well.  For a knock off, and the price difference, it is a nice machine.</li>

    <li> This machine runs well. It is a little hoppy compared to a coil machine. I would recommend, but remember: you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> theses knock off machines are trash if the price sounds to good its not a dragon fly , now there some good co&#x27;s out ther make a good rotary but they run around 250.00 and up., but I dought you find it on amazon</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, runs great, quiet and lightweight machine.</li>
    <li> easy to use, light weight but great for lining, dont use for shading</li>
    <li> Good machine, I been using it for almost a year, but ordered a blue one and got a black one</li>
    <li> Got it out of the box, and used it right away without having to adjust anything. It works perfect every time.</li>
    <li> These rotory machines deliver quality workmanship. A must have!!!</li>
    <li> its a great gun cause it is light but it sticks sometimes and u have to push the are down for gun to work</li>
    <li> estubo exelente complente la compra de este producto entrega responsable y a tiempo sin ningun detalle buena recomendable a cual compra</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this machine as is. It will be great with a full rebuild and WAY cheaper than a comparable pro model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The motor is OK at best (with a good power source and switch it changes speeds)&lt;br /&gt;The slide is plastic as well as connecting rod.&lt;br /&gt; Instead of a bearing on the swivel it is a metal pin rotating with as little friction as possible with this setup.&lt;br /&gt;The needle tensioner is flimsy plastic, it lines up and works but I am afraid it will break with any real use.&lt;br /&gt;The tensioner on top is for looks only and serves no real purpose on the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The frame is solid, one piece and decently made.&lt;br /&gt;The spring clip terminals are solid and easy to work on and change out.&lt;br /&gt; The motor and slide come out easily with just a few small counter sunk allen bolts.&lt;br /&gt; The tube clamp is solid and holds very well.&lt;br /&gt;The motor can be set at different depths to assure proper alignment with the slide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this list I will be trying a 12mm maxon motor (probably model 110044) I am buying a real bearing swivel for the drive shaft. Manufacturing connecting rod and slide block out of hardwood or possibly some natural water buffalo horn. The same for the needle tensioner. After this it will be an entirely new machine. All for under $90 with the functionality of a three to four hundred dollar model.</li>
    <li> motor broke after 2 tattoos</li>
    <li> BURNED MOTOR DURING FIRST EVER USE.  WAS USING 5.0 VOLTS.  SUPER LOW VOLTAGE.  EXTREME KNOCKOFF CHEAPLY MADE DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Throw Away Machine....it&#x27;s a great little machine, and if it breaks throw it away. As a master artist, I can use any machine. I have over 30 machines and I have built many of my own over the years. Takes a little practice just as any thing to tweak it to your specs....I can buy 50 of these versus another company selling basically the same machine for 675$. Very Light weight and runs good.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t to sure on this gun purchase, for its my first rotary always used coil machines but machine is amazing its quit super smooth. Perfect for lining and used it last night for shading. Its sweet. A must have.</li>
    <li> this is just an amazing deal..the heal time less trauma and so cheap you could just throw it away..no complaints here</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied as to how well the machine ran. What I was not satisfied about was that I was only able to use the machine once before it broke. I know it was nothing that I did because I take very good care of every machine that I have. I have a suitcase that is lined with padding on the top, bottom, and sides, and when my machines are in this case they do not move around. As I was getting ready to do another tattoo on somebody, I pulled this machine out so I could get a better feel for it. After examining the machine, I noticed that the plastic nipple that you put your gromlet and opposite side of the needle, had broken off. I love how the machine runs, how lightweight it is, and how quiet it is. I would have given a 5 star rating if it weren&#x27;t so fragile.</li>
    <li> Once tuned it was ready. Only downside is the plastic tension set up, but it is a knock off, so expect less quality in parts.&lt;br /&gt;No trouble with motor or anything else as of yet.</li>
    <li> is nice as you do not need a rubber band to hold the needle in place, however if you tighten too much it will bog the gun down and yes you will fry the motor</li>
    <li> Fell apart second use. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I am a scratcher but from all the different machines i have used, this rotary geys the ink in the best</li>
    <li> Works good for the first rotary I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> excelent product and faster shiping !!! and the cheap price for the market right now ok. I recomend it good</li>
    <li> i ordered this with another gun i had in mind when i set this gun up i had to run it at a higher rate then im used to  but i really like the style and it could have come with a booklet to help with setting it up so you do not burn it up</li>
    <li> it works really well.. not loud at all</li>
    <li> I feel that this is not a very good tattoo machine it was broken does not hold a tube and it is plastic. It also does not come with spare parts  it is very poorly made. I will not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i thought it would be better but its made kinda cheap like the adjuster on tyhe back doesnt adjust anything n when u touvh it it throws the gun outta wack n when u try to turn the knob back it doest do anything</li>
    <li> Total piece of crap. Complete turd. I&#x27;ve literally insulated every electrical component and the body with black electrical tape and it still shorts out my power supply every time I plug it in. Not to mention all the parts are flimsy as S***. Thought I would get my feet wet with rotary with this machine. I&#x27;ve still yet to make it run more than 5 seconds. Save your money and buy something nicer. Your money would be better spent by throwing the cost of this machine straight in the trash. Cuz, that&#x27;s exactly where this thing belongs.</li>
    <li> Works great super quiet</li>
    <li> The machine came and it was extremely cheap and broken out of the box I do not recommend this item to anyone</li>
</ol>
