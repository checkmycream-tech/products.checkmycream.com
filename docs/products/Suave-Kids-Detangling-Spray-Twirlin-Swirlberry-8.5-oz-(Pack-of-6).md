      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>The good thing is it works great, and gets her tangles out with no fuss.</li>
      <li>Great scent even better price!</li>
      <li>it for your kids or buy it for yourself, Suave Kids Twirling&#x27; Swirlberry Detangling Spray is a good product at a good price.</li>
      <li>Yes, I believe it is that good.</li>
      <li>It didnt smooth my frizzies, but I use a coconut oil balm to set my hair which does the trick(the strawberry and coconut smelled suprisingly wonderful together).</li>
      <li>My kids love it!</li>
      <li>Use this eveyday will order again for sure!</li>
      <li>Brush goes thru fairly easy, it&#x27;s pain free  &amp; smells great!</li>
      <li>It is good, but I found better the apple scent, it is hast set with knots.</li>
      <li>I think would have been better off rubbing glue into her hair for all the good that stuff did to detangle.</li>
      <li>Both are nice, but this is the one</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used both on my children&#x27;s hair, and my own hair, and</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>And they smell okay, but not as good as this.</li>
      <li>use this on my own hair, as well.</li>
      <li>It leaves no flaky residue of any kind on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the Awesome Apple is SO MUCH BETTER for really detangling.  </li>
      <li>I was so surprised at how what was a impulse purchase, ended up being one of the best beauty</li>
      <li>Wow we love this product works great, plus it came with a ton of bottles!!</li>
      <li>Great product - great price - my twin girls love how it smells and that it actually does detangle their curly hair!!!</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t justify giving it more than 3-Stars because, at best, it&#x27;s barely gets the job</li>
      <li>This smells pretty nice and detangles fairly well.  </li>
      <li>Works great, great smell, takes the tangles away, leave product in long hair at bedtime and wake up without tangles!!!</li>
      <li>+ it smells better</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re mostly tear-free.</li>
      <li>Just ok...</li>
      <li>spray does nothing for her hair, giving her a bath with conditioner sitting in the hair is still much better.</li>
      <li>Her places got better once I quit using the product.  </li>
      <li>Smells Great, Highly Recommend!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>but I love the smell and it does in fact detangle.  </li>
      <li>We started with the apple scent, but she likes the strawberry scent much better.</li>
      <li>your hair is the more you will will need to use, top &amp; underneath.</li>
      <li>I love this detangler spray for both my daughter and myself.</li>
      <li>Definitely better than not using anything though.</li>
      <li>They cost more.</li>
      <li>This soft &amp; smooth twirlin swirlberry does not do a very good job detangling her hair.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong strawberry scent, which my daughter likes better than apple.  </li>
      <li>Yes, this detangler has a strong berry smell, and I love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got this product for a grand niece with fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
      <li>But, if you need a sweet smelling refresher that leaves your hair soft this is a great choice and a better buy at about $2 at Target.</li>
      <li>This fine spray comes out smelling very sweet.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just too strong for kids going to school.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t think that they have to be so strong that they take your breath away.</li>
      <li>When I used this product I was very pleased it made combing their hair much easier</li>
      <li>With this I noticed no residue and it smells pretty nice.</li>
      <li>she has fine curly hair.  </li>
      <li>softens har &amp; smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>As the raspberry scent  is light and dissipates as it dries.</li>
      <li>It has a light fruity scent that you smell when you spray on but doesn&#x27;t leave you in a cloud.</li>
      <li>I usually buy the Suave Awesome Apple detangler.  </li>
      <li>, now i have a nice ponytail pulled up in the back of my head because this detangler made my hair so soft and silky and it just smells great too.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of magic potion this is, or what they put in it (angel tears?), but I can say that after my friends saw me brush my girl&#x27;s hair, they stole the other bottles in the pack! :)</li>
      <li>and it weighs down your hair, especially if it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I also like how it makes my hair smell nice and not dry.</li>
      <li>and it was no more tangles which is wonderful because i woke up this morning and had to not brush my hair much at all</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not often you get a grooming product that is useful for kids, dogs, and grown-ups.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve had success with [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s useful stuff around here, to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The best thing is this doesn&#x27;t leave behind residue.  </li>
      <li>Sweet scent and really helps to get the tangles out!  </li>
      <li>so i decided i need a detangler of some sort and bought this because it is much more affordable than adult varieties.</li>
      <li>The kids love the smell and their hair is soft and not sticky and brittle after you use it.</li>
      <li>but I have tried some other products that cost a bit more that work better.  </li>
      <li>the purple is a lot less successful in taming snarls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the plus side, it smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my 7 years old daughter from shedding tears and makes brushing out easy.</li>
      <li>A definite purchase for families with more than one head of hair to comb.</li>
      <li>Instead it&#x27;s back to either Magic 10 and/or Suave&#x27;s apple scented</li>
      <li>, so I decided to try Soft and Smooth Detangler.  </li>
      <li>We bought this having to use the manufactures shampoo with positive results untangling our daughters hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nowadays, my hair is still long but curlier, and it gets even more knotted.</li>
      <li>only objection is the strong scent.</li>
      <li>Likewise, it really does work ...</li>
      <li>My daughters have very curly hair</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Have been using this for a few years now on my growing 8 yr olds hair and sometimes my own, and this particular one leaves no sticky residue.  </li>
      <li>But in the end, I had two long smooth corkscrew ponytails.</li>
      <li>I mix in tea tree oil, so far we are lice free even though the school had several outbreaks.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to adults and children.</li>
      <li>highly recommend for both kids and adults.</li>
      <li>This junk smells like that old cherry cough syrup and does absolutely nothing to detangle.  </li>
      <li>It works wonderfully in adult hair too, making it so much easier to take care of my  waist length curly hair.  </li>
      <li>This spray made short work of the grooming as the comb slid right through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once it&#x27;s dry the sweet smell is gone.  </li>
      <li>Made my daughter&#x27;s curly  hair super dry and frizzy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this crap got so many good reviews.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not as good as the expensive stuff, but for the price it does the trick</li>
    <li> This smells pretty nice and detangles fairly well.  It is definitely a lot easier to comb my kids&#x27; hair using this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this crap got so many good reviews.  This junk smells like that old cherry cough syrup and does absolutely nothing to detangle.  I tried it a few times on my daughter&#x27;s hair and each time I just kept spraying and spraying and couldn&#x27;t even begin to get the comb through her tangles.  She ended up screaming and crying.  I think would have been better off rubbing glue into her hair for all the good that stuff did to detangle.</li>
    <li> Made my daughter&#x27;s curly  hair super dry and frizzy.</li>
    <li> For the price the detangler works well but I have tried some other products that cost a bit more that work better.  Definitely better than not using anything though.</li>
    <li> Works great, great smell, takes the tangles away, leave product in long hair at bedtime and wake up without tangles!!!</li>
    <li> I have curly/wavy hair with a mind of it&#x27;s own. I swear I can never make my hair do anything, I&#x27;ve learned to just go with the flow. My main problem was skipping washes because my hair looks kinda crazy when I wake up. But because my hair can get dry, I like letting my hair go 2-4 days without washing so the natural oils can do their job. Before I purchased this I was using a spray bottle with water and a bit of leave in conditioner or regular conditioner to refresh my hair. Problem with that is you get residue left over and it weighs down your hair, especially if it&#x27;s fine. With this I noticed no residue and it smells pretty nice. One thing I noticed was my hair had a strange texture/feel untill it dried then it was extremely soft. It didnt smooth my frizzies, but I use a coconut oil balm to set my hair which does the trick(the strawberry and coconut smelled suprisingly wonderful together). I tried using this to detangle and comb through my curls but I wont be doing that again,at least not with this spray, so if your looking for a detangler spray this is not for you. But, if you need a sweet smelling refresher that leaves your hair soft this is a great choice and a better buy at about $2 at Target.</li>
    <li> I love this detangler spray for both my daughter and myself. It has a light fruity scent that you smell when you spray on but doesn&#x27;t leave you in a cloud. I use it on my daughter who has very long (past her bottom), very curly hair. Her hair is soft, but thick, and gets tangles particularly at the end. We use the detangler spray after we wash her hair to keep some moisture in it. We also use it on her dry hair because otherwise, there&#x27;d be no way to get a comb through it without breaking it off. We&#x27;ve used both this swirlberry scent and the apple scent. Both are nice, but this is the one both she and I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my own hair, as well. My hair is thick and very curly and generally a huge mess in the mornings. This detangler makes it a lot easier to get a comb through it. It&#x27;s way cheaper than the adult products that are out there, and I prefer the scent. I like to use it when I wear my hair down--it gives my hair some control without any heaviness.</li>
    <li> My daughter has the thinnest hair and gets the worst knots, this is the only thing we can use that makes hair brushing less traumatic and she loves the smell.</li>
    <li> We bought this having to use the manufactures shampoo with positive results untangling our daughters hair. She&#x27;s got hair down to her butt, and when it tangles, it&#x27;s a royal pain.&lt;br /&gt;This spray does nothing for her hair, giving her a bath with conditioner sitting in the hair is still much better.</li>
    <li> my wife got it for our daughter and she has been using it for while and its great. softens har &amp; smells fantastic. definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> This item did a bit of double duty.&lt;br /&gt;Not only was it tangle tested on human hair, but it faced the ultimate challange...a Maltese dog with a long, full coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humans first:&lt;br /&gt;An all-over spray on wet hair and the comb glides through all of the regular tangles. With big knots, I sprayed close to the problem area and worked it in with my fingers before using the end of a rat tail comb to loosen the knot. Then combing out the matted bit was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dog:&lt;br /&gt;Like Yorkies, poodles, and a number of other breeds, Maltese dogs have silky hair that can grow long, as opposed to the fur of most other dogs. Even with the required daily brushing and combing, keeping the long white hair soft and flowing is a challange.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of spraying the entire coat I sprayed the brush and comb. This spray made short work of the grooming as the comb slid right through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only objection is the strong scent. A super sweet and cloying artificial berry scent that does not dissipate readily. It&#x27;s just too strong for kids going to school.</li>
    <li> Works great and does what it needs to.  All my girls shower at night and often wake up in the morning with crazy tangles in their hair.  A few minutes with this product and the hair brush is all that&#x27;s needed to get their hair in shape for the day.  Makes the brushing out process easier and relatively painless.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it, and so do I. It helps to detangle her hair and makes her life easier, which in turn makes mine easier!</li>
    <li> This fine spray comes out smelling very sweet.  Yet the product works at detangling hair.  Once it&#x27;s dry the sweet smell is gone.  It leaves no flaky residue of any kind on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nozzle rotates, however, so one has to be careful spraying with this so you don&#x27;t accidentally spray into the eyes.  The nozzle needs a self-locking mechanism so that it doesn&#x27;t move around at all during use.</li>
    <li> Foremost, the smell is DELICIOUS!! It&#x27;s a big berry fragrance that makes this extra step less of a chore. Likewise, it really does work ... in fact, we have purchased a wide variety of detanglers and this works as well as the expensive ones. And, it does provide hair with a softness and shine that I couldn&#x27;t have expected! So, we are now Suave converts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The generous size of the bottle means that you should get plenty of use out of it. (I would say, for us, about three months using it every day on one child with long hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It is good, but I found better the apple scent, it is hast set with knots. My daugther felt the difference.</li>
    <li> Just ok...but I love the smell and it does in fact detangle.  I prefer Pantene&#x27;s detangler but for the value this is OK&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> After  4 days using Suave Kids Twirlin&#x27; Swirlberry I knew these things. 1 It works wonderfully in adult hair too, making it so much easier to take care of my  waist length curly hair.  2 I never want to be without it in my daily routine. So I bought 6more bottles.(the thicker your hair is the more you will will need to use, top &amp; underneath. 3 since using this product I have found the following. My hair is softer, holds less static electricity, and falls out less. 4 I can use it with my herbal essence hello hydration with no problem, the same with perfumes. As the raspberry scent  is light and dissipates as it dries. I was so surprised at how what was a impulse purchase, ended up being one of the best beauty finds I have discovered to date!! Yes, I believe it is that good. I would highly recommend this product to adults and children.</li>
    <li> This is a great value and it works great.  The kids love the smell and their hair is soft and not sticky and brittle after you use it.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 6-pack of this detangler. We go through 2 bottles of the Apple detangler a month, and we&#x27;ve used it for years. I find that this detangler works equally well, but the shape of the bottle is drastically different and therefore almost always requires two hands in order to spray it--and I have larger hands than the average woman. Very irritating!</li>
    <li> My young daughters are 6 and 8, and they both have long hair that often tangles, so brushing their hair is often a painful experience.  With this spray, they love the smell, and coupled with an anti-tangle brush, no more pain!  My kids love it!</li>
    <li> I used this for my 4 year old daughter and myself.  After a couple days use, I noticed she was scratching her head alot.  I looked in her head, and she had little sores all on her scalp.  I started using it on myself and the same thing happened.  Her places got better once I quit using the product.  The good thing is it works great, and gets her tangles out with no fuss.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My hair has not been this soft and manageable in a long time. I also like how it makes my hair smell nice and not dry. Thumbs up from my family.</li>
    <li> Wow we love this product works great, plus it came with a ton of bottles!! Best deal around beats Target</li>
    <li> I hesitate to try new detanglers because some of them leave residue behind, gumming up the hair.  We&#x27;ve had success with [[ASIN:B0002FCDHQ Suave For Kids Awesome Apple Detangler Spray Conditioner 10.5Ounces.]], so I decided to try Soft and Smooth Detangler.  It has a strong strawberry scent, which my daughter likes better than apple.  It does help get some of the tangles out.  I also use it on my son to tame his hair when he wakes up in the morning.  He doesn&#x27;t mind the scent.  The best thing is this doesn&#x27;t leave behind residue.  I can spray it every day and not have to wash her hair but once a week.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my daughter&#x27;s hair for over a year. We started with the apple scent, but she likes the strawberry scent much better. I also use this on my hair. The only real complaint I can say about this product is that the nozzle doesn&#x27;t always work right, but the product works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I usually buy the Suave Awesome Apple detangler.  I picked this up recently for my 3 year old daughter.  she has fine curly hair.  This soft &amp; smooth twirlin swirlberry does not do a very good job detangling her hair.  it stays snarly and difficult to comb.  the Awesome Apple is SO MUCH BETTER for really detangling.  Buy it instead to save your baby some tears!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not often you get a grooming product that is useful for kids, dogs, and grown-ups.  But this one is.  It helps get knots out of kid hair and long snarly grown-up hair, and it makes it possible to brush out the dreadlocks behind the dog&#x27;s ears rather than having to cut them off.  That&#x27;s useful stuff around here, to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is the smell.  I understand that scents for children&#x27;s products are and generally need to be less subtle than scents for adults&#x27; products.  But I don&#x27;t think that they have to be so strong that they take your breath away.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks!! Detangles, smooths &amp; makes hair feel fab in general. I am a former Pantene user and this detangler works every bit as well + it smells better + it costs less!&lt;br /&gt;My sister uses this as well and says that when she does, she almost doesn&#x27;t need hair serum.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for both kids and adults. This stuff is WIN - try it!</li>
    <li> Great scent even better price! Use this eveyday will order again for sure! A definite purchase for families with more than one head of hair to comb.</li>
    <li> Great product - great price - my twin girls love how it smells and that it actually does detangle their curly hair!!!</li>
    <li> This is a life saver. Of course my child doesn&#x27;t sit still to condition her hair after the trauma of rinsing out shampoo. My 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair gets dry and tangled so fast that I cut it to shoulder length. Even so, her hair would start to develop little dred locks in the morning from her turning in bed. Brushing them out gently with a bristle brush took half an hour, with her screaming in rage the entire time. After buying this, I was trepidacious about spraying her hair, but she turned to me laughing and said, &amp;#34;smells good!&amp;#34; Once I got her whole head of hair wet with the detangler, the brush went straight through! Even the pre-dred-locks would disappear with three or four swipes of the brush. I don&#x27;t know what kind of magic potion this is, or what they put in it (angel tears?), but I can say that after my friends saw me brush my girl&#x27;s hair, they stole the other bottles in the pack! :)</li>
    <li> Great on curly hair to control tangles! Keeps my 7 years old daughter from shedding tears and makes brushing out easy. Brush goes thru fairly easy, it&#x27;s pain free  &amp; smells great!</li>
    <li> It does the job, and makes it easier to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> My daughters have very curly hair and they give me a very hard time when combing their hair every morning... When I used this product I was very pleased it made combing their hair much easier and they were very happy with the great smell.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it but this Swirlberry (purple bottle) detangler doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the stuff in the green bottle (apple scented).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always assumed the two products were identical, except for the scent and the bottle.  But they aren&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve used both on my children&#x27;s hair, and my own hair, and the purple is a lot less successful in taming snarls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.  But I can&#x27;t justify giving it more than 3-Stars because, at best, it&#x27;s barely gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy it again.  Instead it&#x27;s back to either Magic 10 and/or Suave&#x27;s apple scented detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~&lt;br /&gt;mom/official family hair washer</li>
    <li> My boys have long hair and they insist on this stuff. I mix in tea tree oil, so far we are lice free even though the school had several outbreaks. This helps get through the tangles and the fruity scent masks some of the oil.</li>
    <li> My kids are all grown up, but I still buy Suave haircare products. I like them for four reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They&#x27;re hypoallergenic (and I&#x27;m allergic to some soaps).&lt;br /&gt;2. They&#x27;re cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;3. They&#x27;re mostly tear-free. (They might sting a little, but not nearly as much as products for adults.)&lt;br /&gt;4. I like the way they smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had long hair, and when I was little, spray-on detangler was my friend. I remember my mom brushing the knots out of my long ponytails. Ow, owie, ow! But the spray-on stuff always helped. To me, it always seemed my mom used it too late and didn&#x27;t spray on enough. But in the end, I had two long smooth corkscrew ponytails. Yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays, my hair is still long but curlier, and it gets even more knotted. Of course, I could buy spray-on conditioner for adults, but why would I? They cost more. They aren&#x27;t necessarily hypoallergenic. They sting like crazy if you get them in your eyes. And they smell okay, but not as good as this. Yes, this detangler has a strong berry smell, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it for your kids or buy it for yourself, Suave Kids Twirling&#x27; Swirlberry Detangling Spray is a good product at a good price. Recommended.</li>
    <li> 2 girls + long hair &#x3D; tangled mess UNLESS you have this product. (I mean seriously, I buy this 6 at a time!)</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!!  Sweet scent and really helps to get the tangles out!  We love using this in the mornings and there is no more screaming!</li>
    <li> Great price, great product to prevent the combing the hair tears!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a few years now on my growing 8 yr olds hair and sometimes my own, and this particular one leaves no sticky residue.  Smells Great, Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> I got this product for a grand niece with fine, easily tangled hair. She needs something that conditions and can be left on the hair. This does the job.</li>
    <li> ok so i have very long very thick hair and i hate brushing my hair because of so many tangles all the time and it hurts to brush my hair so i decided i need a detangler of some sort and bought this because it is much more affordable than adult varieties. Just got home with the bottle, sprayed it all over my hair and grabbed my brush and WOW! thats all i got to say. I was brushing my hair as if it wasnt thick at all and it was no more tangles which is wonderful because i woke up this morning and had to not brush my hair much at all cause was just too tangled so i put it back in a ponytail holder, now i have a nice ponytail pulled up in the back of my head because this detangler made my hair so soft and silky and it just smells great too.</li>
