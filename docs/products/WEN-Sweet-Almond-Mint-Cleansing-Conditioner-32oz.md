<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Look,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be blunt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when my wife asked me to buy shampoo for what I considered to be an outrageous price, it took her at least 3-4 beers to convince me to let her try it.  She&#x27;s usually not high maintenance with hoity toity hair and makeup product, so I guess I cut her a little slack and gave in. She complains that her hair is flat and always has split ends and whether or not this panacea actually works really is moot to me.  I think her hair is always great.  But as they say- &amp;#34;happy wife, happy life&amp;#34;, so I am pleased to report that she has told me that after 3 weeks of use her hair has better volume and feels cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks the same to me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but I smile and lie right through my pearly teeth and tell her hair looks better than ever and I get to smack her butt and have a little fun while she&#x27;s in a good mood&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and one more thing- I also think I overreacted about the price, it turns out she doesn&#x27;t have to shampoo every day now and she doesn&#x27;t have to use huge globs like with the VO5 shampoo and also no extra conditioner.  So in reality I may actually be spending less in shampoo/conditioner costs than I have previously as it may take 6 months to get through the first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so good game WEN, helping husbands get nooky may not have been something you market, but you should consider it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I bought it at the request of my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Five stars for a great product that is all in one for hair care. A product that works and eliminates buying more hair products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best!</li>
    <li> This sweet almond mint smells so good! I really enjoy how my hair feels and looks after using it, its a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Was surprised at how silky my hair became after each shampoo. Really gentle and soothing. I really Love it!</li>
    <li> I buy Wen products for myself and for my elderly mother.  My Mom is allergic to an ingredient in most commercials shampoos so I was happy when I found WEN.  She is able to use WEN without a problem and loves the way it makes her hair feel and look.  I love it too.  I love the Sweet Almond Mint but I&#x27;m going to try the others too!</li>
    <li> The scent of Sweet Almond Mint is invigorating, but that&#x27;s where it ends.  Due to long hair 12 pumps of product must be used.  The expense is evident versus a quarter size of shampoo and conditioner it takes for one wash.  The first three times using Wen left my hair looking greasy at the roots.  The fourth time I rinsed extra long, blew my hair dry and styled it.  That&#x27;s when it did best.  Even now the second day is still better than the first day after washing.  All in all, Wen is okay, but not as stellar as I thought.</li>
    <li> Love my hair with this product. Saves time as well!  No need to do extra conditioning step and combs through wet hair so easy!  No more bird nest tangles!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! You&#x27;ll never go back to regular shampoo and conditioner once you&#x27;ve tried this!</li>
    <li> Great product love the way it makes my hair look and feel</li>
    <li> I tried Wen after watching the informercial on tv. My hair was dry, knotty, and uncooperative from repeated flat ironing. I ordered the sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner. Just with the first wash I could tell a difference in the smoothness in my hair. It also was less tangly. I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now and when I went to my hair dresser she commented on how silky smooth it was. I am a Wen user for life! I recommend this product to everyone. It does take some getting used to when you are used to having lather and bubbles, but I won&#x27;t ever go back to regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner for over 3 years. I LOVE this stuff. The smell is amazing. I have fine, thinnish hair and my daughter has fine, thick hair - works great for both of us. I use less than the recommended amount though. A few pumps (I have short hair) does it for me. I also use it as a shaving cream and body wash. It is so nice to pack only one product when I travel. I buy the big one which lasts a few months. The only down-side to Wen is that the pump stops working when the product starts to run out. I just add some water to the bottle, shake, shake, shake and we are good to go. We use it for our standard poodle too!</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed anything online until now.  I received my first bottle of WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner about 2 weeks ago.  I watched the infomercial about 3 times before trying it. I have baby fine hair, and very little of it.  It&#x27;s also color-treated and gets dry and split ends. I live in a desert climate. I was concerned it would be too oily and weigh my fine hair down.  However, it&#x27;s great!  I use 16-18 pumps for my shoulder length hair. After the first use (yes, the first use), my hair was soft and shiny and not limp/oily at all.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks, and my hair really does seem to get better and better.  I have noticed way more elasticity and shine, and it holds a curl a lot better. It&#x27;s also a great detangler!~  It&#x27;s a small thing in life, but it&#x27;s nice to get a product that actually does what it claims to do!! I&#x27;m on the auto shipments now, so I never run out!  I can&#x27;t wait to try the Re-moist, too.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about the WEN cleansing conditioner.  I love, love, love it and will never go back to regular shampoo and conditioner again.  First of all, it smells amazing.  I use the sweet almond mint and I am totally addicted to the scent.  Second of all, it makes my hair ridiculously soft and silky, but not in a bad way.  I have really thick, not exactly fine-textured but not exactly medium-textured hair cut in sort of a longish pixie cut.  I have used other products which made my hair so soft that it was virtually lifeless, with no body, no bounce, no nothing buy laying flat on my head.  WEN makes my hair the softest it&#x27;s ever been, but it has body and manageability and movement now, and that&#x27;s something I always thought I had to sacrifice in order to have soft, smooth hair.  Imagine my delight when I discovered I didn&#x27;t have to sacrifice that, I just had to switch to WEN!  With regular shampoos and conditioners I was always fighting some battle of the extremes, either my hair was so soft and flat it wouldn&#x27;t do anything, or it was so dry and stripped out that it felt like straw.  And I have always taken really good care of my hair!!  It was frustrating!!  Discovering WEN was like a dream come true for me.  I saw the ad on an infomercial and I thought surely it was too good to be true.  After seeing the infomercial several times, I finally broke down and said okay, I&#x27;ll give it a try.  I was skeptical at first, but now I&#x27;m a WEN girl for life.  I get so many compliments on how shiny and healthy looking my hair is.  My guy loves to bury his hands and face in it.  It leaves no residue, and my hair doesn&#x27;t ever feel or smell dirty or oily.  My hair basically looks like those girls in the shampoo commercials now.  Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with WEN!  I have very thin hair and was starting to loose a little every week or so.  It has stopped falling out and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> Love it, just wish it was CHEAPER!</li>
    <li> First of all, the Amazon seller TERIS CORNER gives terrible customer service, so buyer beware. My item broke in shipping because he ships bottles in PADDED ENVELOPES (?!?!) He didn&#x27;t respond to my problem for almost a week. Then he gave me crap for wanting a $3 refund on my shipping and wanted me to send photos of the damage as proof.    I never blow-dry my hair, always air-dry. My shoulder-length hair is normal and fine with a little body. I was using [[ASIN:B0036QQWAC Pureology Hydrate Shampoo and Conditioner]] and [[ASIN:B001RQI512 Moroccan Oil]] every other day. With regular shampoo my hair is always \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; right after I wash it, then it settles into a nice body-full style by the end of the day and into the following day. I, too, was taken by the infomercial; specifically the ladies who were saying,\\&quot;I just let my hair air-dry and it looks great!\\&quot; I have been using my Wen for 2 weeks which is long enough for my hair to be used to it. It smells nice, it cleanses well, but it definitely coats my hair with \\&quot;something.\\&quot; I like that it allows my hair to look settled and non-poofy after it air dries.     The major downside with using Wen is that my hair is super oily by the next day, therefore I have to shower/wash my hair daily which then means the product is going twice as fast as regular shampoo. My 6oz bottle is 3/4 gone after 2 weeks of everyday use. To me that is not a value and is why I probably won&#x27;t invest again. I also feel like I am wasting water because I do not normally shower everyday. I think I am going to go back to my regular Purology &amp; Moroccan Oil regimine and use Wen as a once-in-a-while conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Leave your hair with body and shine. Easy to use, make sure to thoroughly rinse. Nice fragrance, not overpowering.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001800I44 Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, 32oz]]Absolutely love this product. I was using it from Guthy Renker but it was taking to long between purchasing to receive. I will never go back to regular shampoo. I am a blonde and blondes usually tend to be frizzy and no shine well that is taken care of using this product. My hair is now shiny, soft and smooth. LOVE IT!!!I place my order from Amazon and have it in 3 days. They carry all the products too. Love Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Was given as a gift.  I can&#x27;t use any conditioners, as they make my hair fall out.  The recipients use this all the time with no problems.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent on women of color hair and is so easy and convenient for use.Being a cleanser and conditioner in one is even a time saver.I use it once a week and have seen an increase in my hair length and most importantly,it does not discolor my gray hair.  Oh yes,the price is economical for the size of the product.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Wash my hair everyday and now I don&#x27;t feel guilty because it heals the hair the more you use it.</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my daughter. She gets terribly dry hair and scalp during the cold weather, and Wen is the best product for her hair in winter.  However, I was unpleasantly surprised when I saw that this particular size of Wen had gone up almost $10 from the previous year! I was also able to source it from QVC, and even with the shipping cost, it was still cheaper than on Amazon.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine let me use the last of her Wen, and I liked the results enough to order it.  After a few washes I was disappointed to see that it did not produce the same results as it did with the initial use.  Unfortunately I purchased the big bottle, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions exactly (including using an obscene amount of product per usage) each time I used it.  It left my hair dull and pretty oily (there is no way I could get away with washing my hair every other day).  I asked my friend and she told me that she had to switch it up with other shampoos to avoid build up.  I wish she had told me that when she gave me enough to try it once.  For the price tag on this it should work every time.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and what it does for my hair.  I have very fine naturally curly hair and this product really helps to control frizz.  I wish I didn&#x27;t have to mail order it.  It would be great if I could buy it in stores.</li>
    <li> love this product but too expensive to use on a regular basis.  if price goes down i would buy it again till then i will check for sales or specials.</li>
    <li> I am very glad amazon offers Wen, like many other customers, since I HATE to be stuck in automatic reorders.     About 15 years ago I used to go to a natural hairdresser, who promoted not washing your hair everyday - and if really necessary, only wash it with actual shampoo every once in a while, other than that, there was a natural \\&quot;wash gel\\&quot; that was less harsh to your hair - and brush your hair every day with a natural bristle brush. This philosophy really worked well for my hair but unfortunately, we had to move and I had no more access to the fabulous products. I have to say that there is a transformation phase, when you are used to washing your hair every day, since your scalp is used to produce oil to protect your hair from drying out, every time you wash it, which means that you might end up with oily hair for while until your body realizes that it doesn&#x27;t have to keep up the production anymore.     This really promoted healthy hair growth for me and I actually had new hair growing in that I didn&#x27;t realize I lost before.     Now I finally found a product in Wen, that I can use just like the \\&quot;wash gel\\&quot; and only sometimes, when my hair gets \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; I wash with Aubrey&#x27;s organics shampoo. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday (my hair is curly but not to extreme - more like a very light perm-, medium thick, down to my bra line), I wash it 2 - 3 times a week with Wen and maybe 2 - 3 times a month with the shampoo. I brush my hair every day with the brush I mentioned and I have to say, it works for me. The shine is beautiful and the frizz at the ends is almost gone. I even think it grows faster. I only was at the hairdresser 3 times this year so far and it still looks very beautiful without too much damage. People notice the change in my hair - especially women.     I use about 5 - 6 pumps for each area (top, nape, both sides) and rub it into my scalp and hair really well until it feels \\&quot;slippery\\&quot;. Then I leave it in until I am done showering and rinse it REALLY WELL. Like somebody else said: \\&quot;When you feel you are done keep rinsing for another minute.\\&quot;     I started using the 16 oz bottle at the end of August and still have half the bottle left.</li>
    <li> So I didn&#x27;t see that they had this product through Amazon and I bought it direct from the Infomercial website after seeing the ad several times.  I waited WEEKS to receive my products and had completely forgotten about them until the day they arrived.  After using it for the first time I was skeptical.  Turns out, I was not using enough product.  (Plus you really cant skip the step of rinsing with cool water in the beginning and end of the process) So after the first time of doing this properly, I was THRILLED with my results. I am not one who ever gets compliments on my hair.  I get complements now.  So needless to say I was hooked, and because you really do have to use a lot of product, that 12 oz bottle they send you in the intro kit doesn&#x27;t go far.  I was in a panic that I would not have any Wen left when I go out of town next week (I have been using it for 2 weeks and am about 2/3rds of the way through it (Just to give you an indication of how much you use, I have shoulder length fine hair) and I am RELIEVED that I can order this through Amazon and get expedited shipping.  Its like Hair Crack.  Dont order this if you are thinking you can just use it sometimes; or are thinking that a 32 oz bottle can last 4 months or something, IMHO the 12 oz bottle is NOT a months supply, but rather 2-3 weeks worth if you cleanse your hair every day as I do.  Hope this helps anyone that is on the fence</li>
    <li> I tried Wen on a whim based on some comments from a hairdresser on How Do I Look.  I truly love the way it makes my hair feel.  I&#x27;m gray and don&#x27;t want to color my hair.  My hair now has more life. It doesn&#x27;t feel dry and wild like it used to. I don&#x27;t feel the need to wash it every day to keep it looking nice.  I use the recommended few squirts of Wen in water in a spritz bottle to restyle my hair in the morning.  A few squirts and a quick blow dry and I&#x27;m ready to go.  So while the product is more expensive than traditional shampoo,  I use it less often.  My hair is easier to style without using a lot of sticky, gooey products!  I WON&#x27;T be going back to shampoo.</li>
    <li> Thank you to Chaz Dean for creating an amazing product, the best shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used! It makes my fine curly hair come alive and look great ALL the time.  Thank you to Amazon for making it easy for me to purchase it from Australia.</li>
    <li> Not sure if the product I got is fake, but definitely not as good as the first one I bought.</li>
    <li> Would not be without this product.  It may be expensive, but it is worth every single penny.  My hair is super curly and tends to get very frizzy.  Using this product has turned my hair into large ringlets and very little frizz.  Love it!  You have to try.</li>
    <li> Hey, let me just say that if you love greasy, filmy, lifeless hair, this is THE product for you!  I&#x27;m not the type of person that uses something once and then posts an irate review slamming it.  I give things a fair shot.  I give them many shots, to be honest.  I used the sweet almond mint cleanser for an entire week, following EXACT instructions and my hair came out flatter, greasier, more limp than ever before!  :)  It smells fabulous, I&#x27;ll give it that.  I think it would work really great if you have super dry, dehydrated, over processed hair, overly bleached-out hair but for most people this stuff is way too rich!  I have found a wonderful place in my wastebasket for it and have gone back to my Pantene for curls line.  All is well with the world again!  :)</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. i heard about this through my hair dresser, who swears by it. i notice a difference in the softness and overall health of my hair. plus, it&#x27;s nice to not have to shampoo then condition. it&#x27;s all in one :)</li>
    <li> I was up late one night and ran into the infomercial for this from Chaz Dean and I was sucked in!  I ended up ordering it from their website and got the \\&quot;kit\\&quot; and the membership like the other reviewer mentioned.  WATCH OUT for that!!  They send it to you every three months unless you cancel and it&#x27;s rather spendy.  They don&#x27;t just send you the cleansing conidtioner either, they send you the mask too, which I have yet to use.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the comb that the kit came with and the styling creme.  I think it&#x27;s best to order the kit, then cancel the membership right away and just reorder from Amazon or HSN what you like best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But onto the product and the results.  My hair has NEVER been more beautiful!  I LOVE this stuff!!!  My hair is naturally a little oily at times, flat, and lacks volume.  It can look frizzy sometimes too.  The Wen makes is so smooth and silky and not oily at all.  I have longer hair, past my shoulders and I don&#x27;t use the amount as directed because I found it was a little too much for me, as my hair is pretty fine.  You just have to try and find out what amount of product works best for you.  Once you get that down, you&#x27;ll LOVE IT!!  I got my sister hooked on this product after she came and stayed w/ me for a couple weeks.  She now uses it too.  I asked my hairdresser about it and she said she personally hadn&#x27;t used it but had several other clients who raved about it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair with it like directed as far as it&#x27;s the first thing I put on and the last thing I rinse off.  I also use a pump or two of it as a leave in conditioner.  It smells HEAVENLY!!  So does the stlying creme.  I love that stuff too!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It gives my hair body that lasts all day. The terrible frizz I used to have is gone!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is it leaves a slight film next to my scalp that makes it feel a little oily.</li>
    <li> I have spent a small fortune trying various salon products.  While Wen is a little expensive, I&#x27;m no longer wasting money trying hit or miss products so I feel it is worth the price, and the space saved in my cabinets! I doubt I will ever go back to a traditional shampoo after using this product.  It has been 6 months now and I&#x27;m satisfied with my hair every day.  It took a little while to get used to and 30 days is really about what it takes.  I use the entire line of the Sweet Almond Mint and I&#x27;m completely satisfied with all of the products. I have relatively thick, wavy, color-treated hair.  Using Wen, I can wear my hair curly and it looks great or I can straighten it without a problem.  I was definitely a little skeptical when I first started using this but I&#x27;m happy with the good hair days!  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I live in the desert and my waist length semi-fine hair gets very dry and breaks. I love this stuff. My hair now has life and luster, body and shine. I get compliments everywhere. No split ends! My hair is no longer like straw! The conditioner is deep but doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down at all. It&#x27;s the best. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, though. I&#x27;m waiting for some company to make a knock-off.     But beware if purchasing this from sites other than Amazon. You could be signing up for a monthly product ship contract! I buy one item at a time from Amazon as I need it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner for over two years. In the past, I was always switching shampoos and conditioners. Not anymore. This is the best product I have ever used. I have naturally curly hair and Wen keeps my hair soft and frizz free. I use it as a shampoo and then comb through a small amount as a leave-in conditioner. As a result, I get lots of compliments on my hair. More importantly, my hair looks and feels the way I have always wanted it to!</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous!  I&#x27;ve been using the Wen Haircare Cleansing Creme for two years now and my hair is in the best condition it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
    <li> Did not like! Hair felt greasy</li>
    <li> I actually used this product over a year ago, used it for 2 weeks and decided I didnt like it, then one day I decided I might as well use the product since I had spend alot of money on it. I wanted to see if it really did hold in color in colored hair, so I started using it the day after I colored my hair and kept using it for the next month, I was truely hooked, it kept my color from fading, and in time I grew to love it and did notice my hair looked fuller and healthier, I will never using regular shampoo on my hair.</li>
    <li> The best hair products I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I am unfortunately often hypersensitive to beauty products so was estatic to be able to try this without the downside of being enrolled in one of those promotions where they will continue to send you future shipments on a regular basis.  Even though it costs a little more this way, I&#x27;m not buying more product than I can use and was able to try it out- perfect solution.  I did find that if I used it 3 times in a row I developed a rash but I am overly sensitive.  By using it intermittantly I can enjoy it&#x27;s qualities without reaction.  It really is amazing for the hair.  I have passed on trying out a lot of products because of the &#x27;auto-enrollment&#x27; so thank you Amazon for making this one available.  Easy to order, came in just a very few days, love the stuff.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when a package came for me that day. I instantly rushed to open it, and grabbed the bottles from the box. Ran to the shower and pumped a handful of white goop onto my scalp and began massaging. I love the sweet almond mint and fell instantly in love with the product on my fine textured short platinum blonde &#x27;do.I had purchased the set of three for fine-to medium textured hair. Until, i tried the cucumber aloe! if anyone hasnt done there homework on this product, the cucumber aloe is designed for non colored treated hair. It did NOT work wonders on my over-processed blonde. It ended up leaving me with breakage. :( So, on to the next, Lavender! i was excited about this one because i heard this one was the most \\&quot;voluminous\\&quot; one to make the hair fuller. Tried, and my boyfriend told me my hair smelled like a FOrest!!!! Haha. Overall, on your scalp the products are so invigorating and the overwhelming smell is to much for me. Unless you want your hair to smell like a cedar tree?! I would recommend the sweet almond mint from the set of three and that one ONLY. it seems to be the most universal for every hair type to.</li>
    <li> I know everyone would like to think after going bald that something out there may help in the possibility that hair will regrow! If only this could happen. Well I have had no hair on the top of my head for months heck years and when it did grow there wasn&#x27;t much but after using wen almond mint cleansing conditioner for 4 months it has started to grow.   Little spouts at first like stubble then fuller and longer.  Now I&#x27;m by no means running around with a full head of hair but as my family and friends will attest my hair is growing every day, I love this product and the man who had the brains to formulate it! THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN for over a year now, and I love it. It&#x27;s great for my straight, thin, color-damaged hair.  It leaves it soo soft.</li>
    <li> Anyone who knows me, knows that I am extremely particular about my hair and how it looks.  I received my first trial of Wen as a present from a friend - after the 2nd cleansing, I was hooked!  What do I love about it???  For one thing - no more handful of hair while in the shower!!!  I used to feel that I would be bald before I turned 40 at the rate of hairloss that I&#x27;d end up with while shampooing - not once has this happened with this product.  My husband is ecstatic because I&#x27;m no longer clogging the shower drain! :)  Also - I straighten my hair, first with a blowdryer, then with a straightening iron.  Since I&#x27;ve switched to Wen, I no longer need to use the straightening iron on it!  I figure that not only am I conditioning and keeping more moisture in my hair, but I&#x27;m not frying it on a daily basis like I did before and I&#x27;m saving time getting ready.  Third aspect - I used to have to wash my hair daily - it was uncontrollable, now my hair remains shiny, straight and looks awesome when I wake up on the 2nd day. It&#x27;s just a quick brush through. I never thought that would be possible. In fact, I really think, it starts to look even better as the day progresses.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I used to have bad hair day, upon bad hair day - I&#x27;d fight with my hair to make it do what I wanted it to do.  In all sincerity - that hasn&#x27;t happened once since I started using this product.  I feel like I fell into a miracle here.      I&#x27;m pretty skeptical with a lot of different things, have read the negative comments on the product,and agree, it IS a little bit pricey and the bottle doesn&#x27;t last as long as you may hope it would,but I really do think that if you follow the instructions like it mentions, you get the results they promise.  As if the above wasn&#x27;t enough to convince me, what solidified my decision to go soley with Wen, despite it&#x27;s cost, is when my husband noticed the difference in my hair - how it looks, how it feels and that says A LOT.  My sister mentioned it to me as well- and is now looking into the product herself.   I truly am in love with this product - have raved to all my friends about it - raved on facebook about it.  I&#x27;m usually pretty reserved - but this product deserves a shout out.  It&#x27;s magnificent!  I&#x27;m a lifer.</li>
    <li> When I used this product for the first time I noticed right away the shine my hair had, something I never noticed before with regular shampoo. It also helped with hydrating my scalp, because of a med I am on my oily skin and scalp became very dry and itchy.  My scalp was to the point of bad dandruff, but the cleansing conditioner moisturized my scalp really well and after a few uses my dandruff was significantly reduced, a little longer and I hope it will disappear. Another thing I noticed was much less hair breakage.  Before I was combing and brushing out so much hair on a daily basis that I was beginning to panic (another side effect of the med), but after several uses I have notice much less hair in my comb, brush and tub drain.    I wash my hair every 2 or 3 days and my hair length was half way down my back. While following the direction I used the recommended amount and I noticed that after 4 or 5 uses half of the 16 oz. bottle was gone. YIKES!  My last time using the cleansing conditioner I tried using two fewer pumps for each section and I left out the 2 pumps I was using as a leave in conditioner.  My hair was just as soft and shiny as it was the previous times and I saved 10 pumps.  I do try to leave it in for as long as I can to take advantage of the hydration.  I am looking forward to trying out the lavender cleansing conditioner next and now that I got my hair cut short I am also looking forward to using much less of the product so it will last longer.</li>
    <li> Gave me terrible dandruff. It didn&#x27;t use to...</li>
    <li> Product is great...delivery was excellent other than the bottle was broken because it wasn&#x27;t packed all that good</li>
    <li> WEN is amazing! It cleanses your hair and leaves it perfectly balanced, not dry or oily. Your hair will look and feel like you always wished it would. WEN has ruined regular shampoo and conditioner for me forever. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for several years now and my hair has never been in such good shape. My hair is very fine and 0 body and all I do is lightly blow dry and it stays straight and smooth all day (2-3 days) and it is thicker. No more products for taming frizz and no more flat iron and curling iron. I know it doesn&#x27;t work as well for everyone but my hair loves wen.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was a bit sceptical, but I couldn&#x27;t resist any longer.  After watching the infomerial numerous times, I had to give it a try.  I have very dry (due to color-treating) and thick hair, however because of my oily skin I had to shampoo everyday.  I&#x27;ve been using Wen for almost a month both as a cleanser and as a leave-in conditioner.  My hair has never been softer or more managable.  Even my hair sylist commented how healthy my hair felt and looked.  Also, I have noticed that my scalp is not as oily as before.  I am very pleased with the product and just ordered a larger bottle.  At first, I thought that it was a bit expensive, but it has replaced my shampoo, conditioner and leave-in conditioner so I guess it works out to be about the same.  Lastly, it smells great.    I also purchased the syling cream, and like that as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I didn&#x27;t reveal to my hairdresser the last time I went for a hi-lite that I was no longer using the salon products and she raved about the health of my hair. One other perk is that I don&#x27;t need to cleanse my hair every day anymore. The style holds and it smells great too for days. I&#x27;m satisfied and will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would change my dry, frizzy hair.  Didn&#x27;t work.  I went back to using Pantene (much cheaper and better).  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love the way this males my hair feel and look.</li>
    <li> I never buy infomercial products but I thought I would this one. It&#x27;s terrible! It makes your hair soooo greasy that it looks like it&#x27;s never washed. I tried it for weeks hoping it would work. Yes, it makes your hair less dry, but that is basically never washed. When I went home to visit my family they asked me what was wrong with my hair because it looked so flat and greasy.   I know that big companies like this pay people to write positive reviews on their product to get people to buy it. Don&#x27;t believe these reviews. If you really want to stop using shampoo, just use normal conditioner and don&#x27;t waste your money on this garbage. They also lock you into a lifetime supply. I now have $100 worth of unused terrible product that is going in the trash!</li>
    <li> I have short thining hair, but since I have been using this, my hair is not as unrully and not losing it as much.</li>
    <li> This is great for your hair and it&#x27;s so much easier than using shampoo and conditioner.  I loved the smell!</li>
    <li> I use this daily on my long hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years.  I will not go back to basic shampoo ever again.  I also use this as a weekly conditioner.  I leave it in my hair for an hour and then rinse through,y as I normally would and my hair looks and feels fantastic.  If you haven&#x27;t tried WEN,  you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing.</li>
    <li> Four months after surgery my hair began to fall out big time!  My hairdresser told me it was common and I should try the Wen product to help manage the new growth coming in.  My hair was incredibly curly and short and completely unmanageable.... until I started using the Wen product which restored moisture and gave me the ability to style it.  I am so thankful that I found out about this product when I did but I continue to use it even now that my hair has mostly grown back.  It leaves my hair feeling soft &amp; clean.</li>
    <li> I process by hair by foiling it blonde and Wen after one use repairs any existing damage and coats each strand providing instant moisture and repair. It also protects your color from fade and provides some thermal heat protection. Wen is worth every penny you spend on it!</li>
    <li> I hesitated buying this product because of the mixed reviews and the price. I am worried that you use so much product that I will go broke using it. But it does say your hair will look better and no other products necessary so I am trying it.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, day one, put a little product in my dry hair. WOW is all I can say. Rainy day in Northern California and I have wavy hair/frizzy hair if I don&#x27;t blow it dry straight with product and at least the use of a large barrel iron. But when it rains the hair still poofs out during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I put this product in dry hair just to see and my hair looked beautiful at the end of the day - no frizz like normal. Did I say it was raining today?&lt;br /&gt;Day two, because of the reviews (takes time to get used to) I did not use in shower because if my hair did not turn out the way I liked I would not have time to re-do it. So I put product in wet hair today and blew dry with round brush just like the suggestion. WOW again is all I can say. I did not use the iron today and love my hair - this is not normal!  Did I say it is raining?&lt;br /&gt;I am 51 with graying and highlighted hair. I get my hair cut every 8 weeks because of the use of the curling iron and chemical damage to my hair. I do not like the texture of my hair with most leave in product, and that is why I smooth out the end with a curling iron. (more damage)&lt;br /&gt;If this product alone becomes my finish product and no damage from curling iron and no frizzy I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY!&lt;br /&gt;I will be back in a week or two with update about the use as shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;June 2012&lt;br /&gt;Well I used this product off and on and finally decided to commit to use it for one month. (Dec 11) And haves not stopped now for over 6 month - I love it. If you use a round brush the entire time you blow dry you will like the results more. It did not get rid of my greasy roots the second day but have to admit I love the look of my hair on day two.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like the price or if you buy from Wen I don&#x27;t likethe auto ship option. They send several other products and I don&#x27;t use those products every day.&lt;br /&gt;By the way I never use my curling iron anymore and for that reason alone I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This review is for the 32 oz. Sweet Almond Mint.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week and I have to admit, I LOVE this product.  I&#x27;m not someone that typically spends a lot of time or money on her hair...I&#x27;ve occasionally splurged on a Bumble to Bumble product, but most of the time the ritziest I get is Garnier Nutrisse.  I&#x27;m also one of those people that not only HATES, but lacks the talent/will to style my hair every morning or use tons of product.  The concept for WEN intrigued me and after reading some of the reviews on this site, I decided to give it a try.    First off, let me state that I have shoulder length, very fine, thinnish hair.  And it&#x27;s stick straight.  My hair is the type that typically makes hairdressers weep, curse, and force shampoo girls to run to the store for more bobby pins.  It has very little body and resists all attempts to \\&quot;stay\\&quot; in updos, etc. (at least not without 75 bobby pins and a stiff lacquer of hair spray).  And, when it stays down, it looks dull and limp and lifeless.  All the things hair product marketing typically preys on.  So, most mornings it goes back in a ponytail or up in one of those claw clips.   About the only thing I HAVE done with my hair is slightly over-process it and damage it with repeated hair colorings in a desperate attempt to make it more interesting.    That being said, I ordered this product as a last ditch attempt.  I followed the directions another reviewer posted:  Add five pumps to top and sides of head, five more pumps to middle-ish section, and five pumps to ends.  NOTE: Again, I have shoulder length hair and based on other feedback its best to glob it on there (more is more), so use that as your guide.  After applying, I cupped both hands under the shower water until about half-full, splashed over top of my head, and massaged conditioner in for a count of 60-75 seconds.  After that, I used a shower comb (not the WEN variety, a cheaper CVS plastic version) to comb through working from top of head back and down (making sure to pay attention to right above the ears--one of the potentially dryer spots for me).  After combing through a couple times, I used a plastic clip (The Crane Clip--also available on Amazon) to gently hold the hair up.  I do the hair first (to allow the product to sit on my hair as long as possible--probably between 10 and 15 minutes) and then do the rest of my shower routine.  After finishing up everything else, I unclip my hair and rinse.  I tend to lean towards over-rinsing because I want to make sure I&#x27;ve gotten all the product out.      I now LOVE my hair!!!  The first day or two I had a little bit of difficulty with it feeling dry and with a little bit of static (not enough to be super distracting, more of just a hint).  I adjusted the amount of the product I was using as a leave-in and that solved the problem.  Either that or my hair just needed to adjust.  My dull, limp, lifeless, ugh hair is now shiny, has a naturally full amount of body, feels soft and light and makes me literally want to do the shampoo commercial head toss!  And it&#x27;s not just me, I&#x27;ve gotten tons of comments (from my fiancee--who NEVER notices those kinds of things, to co-workers--who almost don&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t get some expensive salon treatment, to my sisters--who have similar hair types and will be receiving their first bottle for xmas).      I haven&#x27;t had ANY of the problems that previous reviewers have described.  That being said, this review is based on just a week&#x27;s worth of use.  Additionally, I have hair that&#x27;s both thin and fine (which the product seems to have the most success with).  One of the aforementioned co-workers has a different hair type then mine and she&#x27;s going to try the Fig variety.  I&#x27;ve encouraged her to post a review on her experiences too.    Unfortunately, it&#x27;s freaking expensive.  Several other reviewers have commented that the Sally&#x27;s Beauty generic brand works just as well, so I may give that a try and will update my review based on that experience.  If it doesn&#x27;t work as well, I&#x27;m coming back to WEN.  It&#x27;s just works too darn well!</li>
    <li> Wen is seriously the greatest hair product in the world. I use it usually three times a week, and it makes my hair look and feel super clean and revitalized. The product doesn&#x27;t weigh you hair down if you use it properly. Your hair is instantly full of body after the first use, and if you allow your hair to air dry - NO FRIZZ. It really is a phenomenon. My husband even started using the product, and his hair looked thicker and fuller within the first week. Great product.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t believe the hype when watching infomercials.  My hair had become so dry and unmanageable from cheap products and styling.  I decided to give Wen a try.  Best decision of my life!  I could see the difference after the first use...seriously!  My hair was hydrated, soft, and shiny!    There are a few drawbacks to this product.  I have super-thick, long hair so I use a lot of this product.  A 12oz bottle lasted me only two weeks.  It doesn&#x27;t gets sudsy like normal shampoo so it takes a little to get used to.  Also, be prepared to be in the shower a while.  It&#x27;s not just a suds, scrub and rinse deal.  You need to section off hair, apply, massage, comb through and leave for 5 mins, then rinse.  However, IT IS SOOOOO WORTH THE MONEY AND EFFORT!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been a dedicated Wen user for two years. When I forget to pack (3 oz. or less) when I travel, and I&#x27;m forced to use regular shampoo... my hair suffers for it. So, I buy the big bottle and it lasts me a long time!    My husband, who has severe psoriasis on his scalp, loves Wen!    So we both use it and nothing else on our hair.    Just make sure you rinse it thoroughly and your hair will shine like a youngsters!</li>
    <li> There is not doubt I love this product.  But $80.00????...two yrs. ago I could purchase it for $50.00.  I guess it is now only for the rich!</li>
    <li> I bought this product with high hopes. I have thick/corse, curly/wavy, dyed blonde hair that is always in need of some tlc. After reading other reviews and seeing the info-merrcial, I thought it might be the product for me. Unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t. I loved the smell but it wasn&#x27;t enough conditioning for me and my hair felt gunky and weighed down for some reason. It felt kind of greasy. So not what I was hoping for considering the price.</li>
    <li> Love all the Wen products - Wen saved my hair.</li>
    <li> Best Hair product ever!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I will never use anything else for my hair. I even use it on my dog.</li>
    <li> Have been using wen for 3 years and I love it the best shampoo and great in hard water and lasts a long time</li>
    <li> My wife loved it, other than the price it is perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I normally buy Purology for twice the price (not including the shampoo that I would have to buy with it) so I thought I would give it a try.  I was very skeptical of it because it seems from the reviews that it only works really well on thick dry hair, and I have very thin and oily hair.  It left my hair very soft, no fly aways or frizziness (which is usaully a bi problem for me) and allowed me to dry my hair naturally, which I havn&#x27;t been able to do since I was young. It left my hair feeling shiney and so soft that my husband and my friend could not stop touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I would only give it 4 stars is because you have to use a lot of product and it is a pretty lengthy process.  Also the next day my hair was pretty oily so I would have to wash my hair every day (I usaully only wash twice per week).  Jury is still out on whether I will continue using this as it may end up being more expensive than my other shampoo, since I have to use more of it and more often.  Overall it really is a good product and would recomend to anyone who has the time and money.  Make sure to follow the directions to a T though.  I think some of the other bad reviews were because they didn&#x27;t rinse their hair long enough before and after applying the product.</li>
    <li> I just started my 4th bottle of WEN and noticed right away that it&#x27;s different. It&#x27;s not as thick and it looks and smells different. Ingredients listed are the same. I like the original stuff - will have to see what this formulation does for my hair.</li>
    <li> We originally received a small bottle as a gift a year ago. My husband likes the way his short hair feels and behaves when he uses this product as a conditioner after he shampoos with an actual shampoo first. He can not use it alone as his hair is quite greasy if he does. I tried it and did not feel that it made any difference in how my long dry hair turned out.  The WEN product is so expensive that he uses the least amount possible.  I won&#x27;t use it due to the cost as it is approximately 10 times the cost of other quality products.</li>
    <li> Love this cleansing conditioner, no more bad hair days.  Received in perfect condition, this item was well packed to prevent damage and quickly.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and how it makes my hair feel, but when I use it my hair falls out!</li>
    <li> I am a Wen user for life!  O.k. at first I was sceptical and thought i&#x27;d just give it a try. I have baby fine hair but a ton of it.  After the first use, I was hooked!  My hair has never been the same and I wouldn&#x27;t ever dream of using a shampoo/conditioner again!  I can cleanse my hair and let it air dry without fighting to blow dry or style it into submission.  My hair has even gotten back it&#x27;s natural wave that I haven&#x27;t seen since I was a kid!  Don&#x27;t wait to try it, once you do you will LOVE it!</li>
    <li> my hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. She says that her hair looks with more life, straight and very soft. She loves it and I love it too.</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of all oils and color. Just right! Feels clean, tingly mint and not dry.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  When I washed and conditioned my hair with Wen Sweet Almond Cleansing Conditioner, it left my hair shiny and healthier looking than it was before.  The longer you leave it on, the more your hair will improve in its condition.  I left it on overnight and it was sooo.... shiny and great looking.</li>
    <li> I have average hair, shoulder length. I justify the cost of this shampoo because I don&#x27;t dye my hair at ALL. Its expensive, but works great. Its a lot less thick than the winter mint, and I can get away with 5-6 pumps for my thin shoulder length hair. I love it. I do a pea size amount of leave in, and i&#x27;m good to go. I can smell my hair all day and its a very subtle lavander. My hair is soft and silky. I&#x27;ve tried other scents and this is my favorite. I like the thinner consistincy and feel that it spreads better. I comb through it in the shower and clip my hair up for the remainder of my shower routine. highly reccomend this scent to anyone wanting to try Wen and see what it does for their hair.</li>
    <li> This is good at reducing hair that sticks out but it removes too much of the fullness of my hair.</li>
    <li> Saw the commercial and was not to sure about the product. I was tired of my hair feeling so dry specially after I dye my hair at the salon. So I went on a quest to see how true this product works. I got the three bottles of Wen Cleansing Conditioner and the price was good for the bundle. The first day I tried it and blow dried my hair I notice how soft and vibrate the color looked. After one week my family and friends also commented on how nice my hair looked and asked about the products I was using. I then started to notice that my dry scalp was starting to go away, which made me believe this shampoo had a lot to do with that. As a person who doesn&#x27;t give in to the infomercials on t.v. I must say this product made me a believer. Thank you Chad for such a great product.</li>
    <li> Use daily, cleans moisturizes!</li>
    <li> I like Sweet honey peach best.</li>
    <li> This may be more expensive than a regular shampoo, but you don&#x27;t have to buy shampoo and conditioner and you use less.  So I think you are spending about the same as you would with regular shampoo and you are getting a great product.  No build up and soft clean hair. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> This is the only cleaner I use on my hair. My boyfriend even tells people I use WEN when people say I have great hair.</li>
    <li> It took me 6 months before I liked this product because I have to wash my thin, fine, blonde hair every day if I want to style it. So I don&#x27;t wash when I don&#x27;t have to but if I am going out I wash it. Even if that means several days in a row.  My hair is thick, full and I can do a lot more with it!!! I Love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product off of the TV commercial and liked it so much I came onto Amazon and purchased it. Be careful if you have bought the product off TV first because what they don&#x27;t tell you is that it is a \\&quot;membership\\&quot; therefore you get three monthy deliveries of the product and they charge your card three seperate times. I had used up my frst batch and decided to ordered more on Amazon; then all of a sudden I am receiving two packages of Wen Hair Care. One from Amazon and a \\&quot;surprise\\&quot; on from Chaz Dean.</li>
    <li> I feel for those that fall for the advertising of this product. You can do better by just using something like Pert and adding conditioner to it! This Wen is junk and is not worth 20% of the price payed. If you wash every day with long hair than trust me.. Try buying a large bottle of Pert shampoo/conditioner and a regular bottle of Pantene conditioner and mix the two and use like you shampoo regularly once a day. Works great for less than half the price!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a WEN woman for at least 4 years but I came into it thru the infomercial and that product is different in composition from THIS, you want to look for a bottle with the smaller label that does NOT have the words &amp;#34;by Chaz Dean&amp;#34; under the word WEN on the lable.  It says just WEN.  (If you&#x27;re looking at a bottle with a label that wraps around the whole bottle stay away from it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuz after about 3 years or so I noticed that my usually outrageously silky straight tresses were drying out at the ends a little.  I also didn&#x27;t want to get into the infomercial racket again, I don&#x27;t use NEARLY that much product in 3 months not do I have the $100 a month it costs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking OF how much to use, I do NOT use as much as it recommends, I&#x27;m just sure to have my hair good and wet and simply apply as much as I need to make it slippery.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so it you use that as a guide you should be happier with the whole process and the results! :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, given the dryness, I came to my trusty Amazon to see if I could find a different cleansing conditioner...I&#x27;ll never return to shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read till my eyes crossed and couldn&#x27;t understand how so many people had had such poor experiences with WEN!  Then I found one other reviewer who had discovered this business with the two different formulations and it began to make more sense...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already learned that there are adjustments you need to make, like adding lots of water while you are working this in so you can rinse it out rather easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I learned that the first 4 ingredients in the infomercial and sadly the Prime versions here on Amazon, are water, glycerin and two kinds of alcohol with Aloe Vera buried down in the middle somewhere, but THIS version starts with water, Aloe Vera gel, glycerin and goes straight to chamomile extract and other botanicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so I was nervous waiting for this since the lowerquality WEN HAD served me so well for years...But I was getting a spot on my scalp that was itchy and flaky plus the dry ends so I knew I needed a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also REALLY curious to see if the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; initial formula Chaz Dean had come up with would fix the problems I was having and be as good as I knew it COULD be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it is wonderful!! :-D  My hair stays cleaner than ever but the ends aren&#x27;t dry anymore and the scaly patch is gone after just one washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that surprised me tho, that deserves mentioning, is that this version is even thicker and more concentrated than the other!  So your hair has to be REALLY drenched when you begin application and if it loses its feeling of wet slipperyness and starts to feel unmanageable or heavy you&#x27;ve got to add even MORE water to it!  So this huge bottle (cheapest per ounce) will last me probably a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re really having trouble try mixing some of the WEN with water beforehand till it&#x27;s lighter and use it more like a normal shampoo.  I&#x27;m using one of my old WEN pump bottles to dilute it in, just be sure and use hot water if you do it this way and shake it very vigorously to get a smooth result. I say use it like regular shampoo, but that&#x27;s not really right... of course it won&#x27;t lather and you&#x27;ll still use more product than a normal stripping drying shampoo, BUT oh it&#x27;s so gentle and thorough! :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that time of life for me so I generally have to tie my long hair up cuz it&#x27;s so hot, which means my hair is rarely loose and catching dirt and oils and I only wash it when my roots get oily, and with WEN, this takes a LOOONG time, like over a week!  So I&#x27;m not kidding when I say this bottle will likely last me a year as concentrated as it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m finally a GENUINE WEN girl and loving it!</li>
    <li> I have really coarse thick hair. I was hoping this would be my one miracle.. But honestly this has left my hair drier than what it was before. I had to stop using it. I couldn&#x27;t manage my hair like normal I don&#x27;t know if others loved it but everyone has different hair and this just wasn&#x27;t for me. Sadly enough I use Aussie from over the counter and it really is the one miracle for my hair. who would of thought!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, about to my waist...  and I was having trouble finding a shampoo and conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t dry out the ends...  I used all high end products but all of them fell short.  I decided to try this shampoo/conditioner to see if it would work for my hair, and help my very dry ends.  To my surprise, it works amazingly well.  My hair is soft from root to tip, and the frizzyness has gone away completely.  I am very happy with the product, and this is my second order of it... I just love washing my hair in one step without the need for both shampoo and conditioner.  Considering what I spent on both shampoo and conditioner in the past this product is just about the same price (maybe a couple of dollars more but it is worth it)    It takes some getting used to, but once I learned how to use the Wen properly I have had no problems... no buildup... no dryness.  I really like the fact that you can use it also as a leave in conditioner too.. so I guess if you add that cost in then it is a real bargain!  Every two weeks I do use the mask, and I leave it in all night for the full effect.    My hair is rather fine, very long, and color treated.  I find that it cleans very well, and as I said it makes my hair shiny and very silky and soft from root to tip.</li>
    <li> I did love this product but the ammount you have to use to achieve the results makes it cost prohibitive...too bad!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy Chaz Dean&#x27;s Wen conditioner because it works as he claims it does. It keeps my hair really clean without drying it out or making it greasy. I much prefer this product to all others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Good product, leaves hair very soft with a noticable decrease in the frizz factor.  I am still waiting for my hair to look like the models in the informercial.</li>
    <li> Love it.  But can&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> What an incredible sales pitch for this product.  I was so convinced I bought the 32 oz., thinking I would need this amount to see a difference in my hair.  After all, the directions call for alot of product with each use.  Well, the bottle is all gone and my hair is unchanged.  No miracles here.  I thought that since I had been using Head &amp; Shoulders since I was young to maintain my scalp, it would be okay to switch since Wen is such a healthy product.  After one week I started getting sensitive spots on my scalp.  I still stuck to using tons of Wen product to no avail, and yes, I followed the instructions. I am a 46 year old white female, with medium length, fine hair that has been permed and colored.  The Garnier Fructis products I had been using did a better job, so I have gone back to them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about five years now. I absolutely love it! I have very fine, thin hair, and Wen adds body and volume. It took a little while to get used to &amp;#34; no bubbles&amp;#34; when shampooing, but now that I use it almost every day, it is no longer an issue.</li>
    <li> I have tried the lavender and the sweet almond mint, I followed the directions and had really good results  My hair is very happy.  I am normally a cheapskate, but am telling myself that the state of my hair matters every day, and that I will in fact save something on not needing to buy serums, fancy conditioners and other products like to try to calm and/or restore my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen products for at least 2 years and I love them very much.  I would encourage everyone to use them at least once.  When you go back to shampoo there will be no doubt what shampoo does to your hair.  Try it and see what I saw.</li>
    <li> I bought this one as a combination with the tea tree.  The tea tree offers great scalp care and the sweet almond mint helps with the volume. I love this stuff, never go back to shampoo :)  oh and yes it really does clean your hair, with out suds.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, especially for &amp;#34; middle-aged&amp;#34; hair. In just 4 weeks my hairdresser noticed a significant improvement in the health of my hair. Plus, it&#x27;s more manageable. Just be sure to use a good salon quality shampoo and conditioner once a week to get out the residue. Ordering from Amazon also keeps you from having to deal directly with Wen, which doesn&#x27;t have the best customer satisfaction when it comes to shipments.</li>
    <li> This cleansing conditioner is AWESOME! Makes my hair so soft and manageable. I thought it might weigh my hair down but no! LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner since April of 2008, and will never, EVER use anything else.  My hair was in AWFUL condition...after 25 years of unrelenting abuse, I had weak, limp, dry, damaged, falling out hair.  Within 3 months of using WEN, my hair looked like it did when I was a teenager, before I started treating it so badly.  I regularly color my hair (gray cover once a month, highlights, 4ish times per year) and find that color lasts a LOT longer since I began using WEN.  My hair is incredibly healthy and has grown longer in the last 2 years than it ever has before.  My hair went from being extremely dry to being shiny and bouncy, and I can easily go 2-3 days without \\&quot;washing\\&quot; it.  Like an earlier reviewer said, it is extremely important that you read and follow the instructions.  I don&#x27;t use quite as much as is suggested, but my hair is reasonably fine.  During the winter, I will use it as a \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot;, since the cold, dry air in Wisconsin is so hard on skin and hair.  I love this stuff!  The ONE time I had to use shampoo (was separated from my luggage on the way to a spa weekend and had to use the high end stuff they supplied) I couldn&#x27;t believe how frizzy and dry my hair was!  NEVER again!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, fine color treated hair and have used Fredrick Fekkai (was sold at Sephoria and Now its at Target) for over eight years. Fekkai is very expensive so over the years I would try something new but it never produced the results so I would return to FF.     After watching the  infomercial for WEN 100 times I decided to give it a try and I love it and will never go back to FF again. The results are exactly as described and I recommend this product. Less expensive overall than FF and better results! I&#x27;m a WEN girl for sure!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous! The ends of my hair aren&#x27;t brittle and crunchy anymore and my hair is always clean and soft. It&#x27;s not weighed down or greasy and smells pretty good. Try it. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you something....THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK.  So, for years and years (pretty much my whole life) I&#x27;ve just used \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; shampoo....Suave, Pantene Pro-V, whatever my Mom bought from Target etc.  My hair has never looked beautiful and voluminous and shiny like some girls I know.  I almost always wear my hair up, so it never really made a difference to me.  Well, I saw the infomercial for Wen and it was extremely convincing.  The girls&#x27; hair in the commercials looked AMAZING.  It said if you used Wen, you would have shiny, frizz-free, voluminous hair.  I bought it, was really excited to use it, and.....NO DIFFERENCE whatsoever.  My hair is normally SHINE-FREE, matte, boring, ugly, FRIZZY, THICK, and DRY.  Wen made me believe there sulfate-free shampoo would make my hair beautiful and that my problem all along was the sulfates in regular shampoo.  I used Wen on multiple occasions, and there was NO difference, and I mean NONE.  I even tried to help out the product- I completely stopped using a blow-dryer (for weeks I didn&#x27;t touch a blow dryer) and would just let it air dry as I drove to school/work, I completely stopped using a hair straightener for weeks and weeks.  Just using the product and letting it air dry I thought would at least help it do what is claimed it would do.  It DID NOT, \\&quot;make my hair bounce back to life,\\&quot; it did not give it more volume, it DID NOT make it shiny and beautiful in the sun.  And the worst part?  When I used it and would smell my hair, it smelled METALLIC..... (!?!?!  At least make my hair smell as amazing as it smells when they use the expensive stuff from the salon.  It smelled weird.  I used the product just as it said to, with 4-6 pumps per. 4 dif sections of my hair.  This product is a major bummer.  Maybe they&#x27;re onto something about shampoo not having sulfates in it that \\&quot;strip\\&quot; the hair (they compare it to using laundry detergent in your hair), and that shampoo should be sulfate free, but I just didn&#x27;t see any results that were different than using Garnier Fructis (or similarly affordable shampoo products  on my hair.  :  i even tried, like I said, to NOT use a blow dryer AT ALL, NOT use a hair straightener, wash my hair EVERY OTHER DAY (instead of every day to).  Then I would look at my hair in the sun to see if it was as beautiful and bouncy and shiny as some other girls whos hair I envy.  But, nope.  Still the matte boring shine-less hair I have and have always had.  Let me also say I rarely color my hair, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s \\&quot;damaged\\&quot; from color because I rarely even color my hair!!  And while I&#x27;m talking about color, I have gotten red color before in my brown hair and after I came home from the salon, and was washing it with shampoo in the shower, I would just see TONS Of red color just washing down the drain.  It was depressing, so maybe Wen (being sulfate-free), helps with maintaining color vs. a cheaper shampoo, but I wouldn&#x27;t know because I don&#x27;t have color in my hair.  They did say on the commercial it helps maintain color).    Overall, I was really sad I spent money on this product because it did not give me any beautiful shine whatsoever.  I seriously can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s getting any good reviews at all because my hair still looked matte and shine-less when I used it, (AND STILL FRIZZY!!!).  I don&#x27;t care how expensive a hair product is, if it HAD made me look like the girls in the commercial, I would spend whatever on it, no matter how expensive, but it didn&#x27;t take away the frizz, didn&#x27;t make it shiny, and made it smell metallic and weird.    :  Major sad face for being born with the hair I&#x27;m born with and Wen not working like it said it would.  By the way, as a side note, I just wanted to say it&#x27;s not just Wen that doesn&#x27;t work.  I just bought ANOTHER expensive \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot; shampoo called S Factor, about $30 for a regular sized bottle, and I see no difference after using THAT product EITHER.  All these stupid expensive shampoo companies, I just don&#x27;t know, you know?I just see no difference, so I&#x27;m going to save my money and just use (see following):   All that&#x27;s worked for me is to literally just spray on a \\&quot;shine-product\\&quot; after using regular ol&#x27; shampoo and conditioner (I use something from Fantastic Sams called Spray Shine Finish.  I used something a long time ago from Garnier or some cheap company similar to that where you basically just spray a shine onto you hair after you&#x27;re done blow-drying and straightening it (or however you style it), then you get immediate shine in the sun and it just looks great.  That&#x27;s really the only time my hair has looked shiny and pretty.</li>
    <li> Large bottle of Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner without an auto ship. Thank you WEN by Chaz Dean for this option. BTW, this stuff works.</li>
    <li> was the worst hair product I have ever used. I&#x27;ve seen the infomercials for a couple of years now and thought it was too good to be true. Then I saw it on QVC one afternoon, and this far I&#x27;ve loved the things I have bought off there. Except for this. First off, I have thick medium length hair, and according to the bottle I needed 16-24 pumps of product. Are you kidding me?? That was more then I could even fit into my hand. If I need that much product to clean my hair you need to rethink your formula and make it more concentrated or something. Then it &amp;#34;recommends&amp;#34; to cleanse again with half the amount of pumps used the first time. So let&#x27;s lowball and say I used 16 the first time and 8 the second. That&#x27;s 24 pumps of cleanser that I needed for one shower. No wonder they sell a jumbo size bottle, because if it was a normal size you&#x27;d blow through it in a week. Now, let&#x27;s go on to the actual cleansing. Well, more like lack there of. My hair was greasy the next day and I can usually get away with washing my hair every 2-3 days. But I wanted to give it a fair shot and try again, so I used it for about a week with the same results. The smell was nice, that&#x27;s about the only good thing I have to say about it. I&#x27;ll be sticking with my sulfate free shampoo and conditioner from now on. P.S.if you actually watch and read the commercials with the before and after pictures, they&#x27;re only using shampoo on the testers. Yeah, their hair isn&#x27;t going to look nice with just shampoo, duh. That&#x27;s why you condition after. Never again, so disappointed I really wanted go like it.</li>
    <li> 65 y/o colored hair gets dry and fly-away.  Wen cleansing conditioner has revitalized my hair and keeps it soft and DOES NOT strip the color.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell my hair feels great.</li>
    <li> ...so first I saw the infomercial.  I was intrigued but having been majorly dissapointed by infomercial haircare products before, I chose not to order.  Then I overheard a woman in my yoga class say she has been using Wen and what a difference it has made with her hair.  We do a form of hot yoga and it completely fries your hair.  Her hair was so thick, smooth, and shiny!  Once I heard that she was using Wen, I couldn&#x27;t wait to order.      I ordered directly from the Chaz Dean website, so I can order when necessary and it arrived in about 7 days.  I ordered the comb too, but if you have one already it&#x27;ll probably do the job.  The first time I used it, it took me awhile to get a hang of because it seems like there is a lot of steps.  It&#x27;s actually very simple and I was a pro after the 3rd time.      All I can say is wow!  My hair is soft, shiny, bouncy, and full!  The color even looks better.  The craziest thing is my husband even commented on how healthy it looks and thought I had gone to have it done at the salon.  I have nothing but positive things to say.      I read all the reviews and saw some about it making peoples hair oily and flat.  To each their own, but I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.  While my hair is straight, below shoulder length, and dry (color treated), my scalp is incredibly oily and I didn&#x27;t have that problem at all. I also read some comments that people didn&#x27;t like the way it smells.  I chose the almond mint and I think the smell is very subtle and I can&#x27;t smell it at all once my hair is dry.    I&#x27;ll be buying by the gallon next time.  I&#x27;ve never been so excited to wash my hair because it looks so good afterwards!</li>
    <li> I really like the wen product line itself.  I have used many of the varieties of the cleansing conditioning. Not having to use a cleanser and conditioner daily is nice.  There are not many brands of high quality 2 in ones out there.  I prefer the almond mint for my chemically abused, oily at the end of the day hair.  I really don&#x27;t care for the delivery system.  I wish they had a choice of a pump or a squeeze type lid.  After you have used the pumps for awhile you can judge how much to use and the pump just becomes cumbersome.  Please just provide us with a pop lid.  I can use a ping pong ball size for my entire head - instead of pumping forever.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The commercials for Wen lead one to believe that the shampoo makes an immediate difference in your hair.  This could not be further from the truth.  There is NO difference in the three weeks of use.  I fell for another \\&quot;infomercial\\&quot;  Shame on me.</li>
    <li> I have thinning long highlighted blonde hair and the Wen Almond Mint conditioner brought it back to life. I don&#x27;t use styling products in my hair so I am not scrubbing the scalp, rinsing and trying to make this stuff \\&quot;lather\\&quot; like the other reviews said. I start my shower with the Wen conditioning cleanser applying it scalp to ends, then comb through with a wide toothed comb then apply a little more concentrating on the ends.  I really didn&#x27;t think this stuff would \\&quot;clean\\&quot; my hair but it does with a minimal scalp massage. Even with my thin hair I use a pump of it and leave it in to blow dry easier.  I wish it came in a tube form as once the product gets down to the bottom of the bottle, like 20% of it doesn&#x27;t come out.  So don&#x27;t throw the cap away. Once the pump stops pumping stuff out, put the cap back on it and invert the bottle for your next wash.  But yea, I love this stuff...</li>
    <li> Love the product amazing</li>
    <li> I was sceptical at first, the ratings were good but my hairdresser wasn&#x27;t impressed. I tried it anyway, and WOW. The first time I noticed my hair was unbelievably shiny, soft, and I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it. I now use it a couple times a week and have been for over a year. I love this product! I am thrilled with the results. Just make sure and follow the directions. Those directions make a difference, even if I skimp a little on how much product I use, I always make sure to rinse my hair well beforehand, take the 1-3 minutes to massage it in, and then let it sit for a while, before rinsing really well before I get out of the shower.  Good Luck</li>
    <li> Love the WEN. It always arrives promptly, and is well packed. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love the Wen products, so gentle on your hair.  Not snarls after washing, easy comb through.  Would recommend it</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Changed my hair for the better!</li>
    <li> First off let me say that I left a review for the Fig WEN that wasn&#x27;t so shinning. The intense smell of the fig was too much and I didn&#x27;t see much improvement of my hair after using that entire bottle. BUT I thought- maybe it wasn&#x27;t for me. Even though I fit the profile for that product- color treated, dry, frizzy, etc.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to go w/the classic Sweet Almond Mint and see if it was any different. This one was much milder in scent which I was very happy about. I started to notice that my hair was changing after about the 3rd wash. I think the month I spent on the Fig and the 3 washes with the Sweet Almond Mint was starting to finally work. Now I&#x27;m totally converted. I love WEN! It&#x27;s very expensive for me, but I&#x27;m going to try and make this work somehow. I&#x27;ve never had my hair feel this soft and look this shiny. I live in West Texas where the water is HARD and brutal to your skin and hair, and honestly it took a longer time for WEN to work on my hair than say if I was living/around the Austin area where the water is much softer (or even in Southern California where the water is really soft and nice), SO if you live in an area w/hard water- give it time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my conclusion- if after 3 bottles you don&#x27;t see a difference: then find something else, but just give it time! 3 bottles- 3 months. I know everyone wants a &#x27;right now&#x27; sort of results but it does take time. Your hair is new to this just as you are, so be patient and let it work for you.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, and only use 3-4 pumps. You do NOT need to use the recommended 10-15, if you use to much, yes, your hair will look greasy</li>
    <li> I read many reviews. I tried several different kinds of the product. The infomercial indicated this would help with dry frizzy hair and extend the life of your hair color. My hair is very thick, coarse, dry and flyaway. I used the products according to the directions. I used their extra conditioner. I tried the products for well over six months. I loved the smell of the produts. I never received the results that I wanted and needed. Now - I am looking for something else. I wish that I could have receive the great results that so many others received.</li>
    <li> I  am enjoying the way this makes my hair feel.  I have dry hair - put regular shampoo and conditioner on it and it gets worse.  I will continue to use this product.  Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I had a friend with long thick hair recommend this product to me, and I was a little hesitant.  I have thin but very curly hair.  I first tried the Almond Mint Cleanser and fell in love.  I&#x27;ve recently tried the fig and have seen different (not as great results).  I sometimes go back to my regular shampoo just to keep from overusing the product, but I really do like it.  My hair was softer and I could actually run my fingers through it.  And those with curly hair know that that may be a challenge.  I haven&#x27;t tried the other cleansers but definitely recommend the almond mint!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the when products and this size bottle out while this me to order less often. I really love it because it makes my hair shine and feel soft and makes it much more manageable.</li>
    <li> Love the product, hate the price</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
    <li> Love the big bottle and pump-I&#x27;m a WEN girl now and get lots of compliments on my shiny hair.  I find I have to wash less and my hair is easier to style since I don&#x27;t have to use smoothing serums or concentrated blow-out techniques to straighten and smooth.</li>
    <li> great but i like the smaller bottles</li>
    <li> Wen is great for problem hair.  I have been using it for 3 yrs.</li>
    <li> This does not smell good. But I don&#x27;t like mint, and it smells like a piece of gum.... Guess I didn&#x27;t know it would be so strong.&lt;br /&gt;I notice zero difference with my hair, even after half the bottle was gone. And the amount it suggests I use for my hair, is rediculous. If i went by the instructions, this would be gone in 2 weeks.....  Did not work at all..... total waste of money</li>
    <li> Love the wen products...I just get it from Amazon because it comes too frequently when ordered directly from the company and can be a big expense.  makes you hair as smooth and silky as can be.</li>
    <li> I went sulfate free with WEN hair care and my hair has never been better, I just wish I could buy it in my local salon and not have to pay for S &amp; H.  But one thing I don&#x27;t understand.  The WEN sold on QVC is the same product, with the same ingredients, as is sold in Chaz Dean&#x27;s California salon.  But the product sold on the infomercial has different ingredients.  Not a big difference, but they are not the same.  If you look carefully at the label, the salon/QVC products will simply say WEN, and the (different) infomercial products say WEN by Chaz Dean.  I can&#x27;t imagine why there is a difference since Chaz is all over the infomercial so he is behind that product 100%.  I did try the infomercial product as a way to sample WEN, and I did love my hair, it wasn&#x27;t until I found it on QVC and purchased from them that I discovered the ingredient mismatch.  Also, cancelling the auto ship from the infomercial was a bit of an issue.  Buying from QVC, when Chaz Dean is on is the best time to stock up with good deals.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair dry</li>
    <li> The product its great but the pump has never worked. I would have sent the entire purchase back to Amazon but I had thrown away the packaging.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing since vinegar for jellyfish stings.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter &#x27;s hair is a mess: dry, frail, thin and frizzy. This product turned her hair into full shiny springy curls worthy of envy.</li>
    <li> I had been a Wen girl for several years and Wen was helping me with thinning hair on the top of my head.  I truly don&#x27;t know why, but I listened to the infomercial for another product involving a shampoo and a leave-in product containing low doses of Minoxidil and purchased their product.  I know, I know - I should have had better sense, particularly after having USED Wen, but I thought the grass might be greener...... But of course it wasn&#x27;t.  This other product warned that there would be initial hair loss, but this was to be expected because it was just &#x27;weak&#x27; hair. I could expect the new, replacement growth to begin in 2-3 months.  I tried for 6 (yes, 6 - I&#x27;m a glutton for punishment), but all that happened was my hair kept falling out. I&#x27;m back to Wen now and my hair is coming back already, after just a couple of weeks. I&#x27;ll NOT be leaving again  :-D</li>
    <li> I only use Wen for my hair.  I absolutely love the Sweet Almond Mint scent.  I use it every day.  My hair is long and oily, but have damage mid-shaft and ends because of coloring.  Wen saved my hair.  One thing, watch the videos for in-depth instructions and you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Just Google Chaz Dean and go to his studio and there you&#x27;ll find what hair type you are, ie. fine to normal, normal to course, and so on.  It shows you how to use the shampoo and the styling creme and so on.  It&#x27;s true that you must use more than conventional shampoo, but the results are stunning!  I watched the videos and still goofed.  Even though I goofed at first, my hair still came out great.  Actually, people that have hair (especially young people) that is not damaged and normal, can still use conventional shampoo, but for me, \\&quot;baby boomer\\&quot; I need help.  The other Wen products are amazing.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of the styling creme and the re moist intense mask last a decent amount of time.  It&#x27;s the old adage \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot;  I use nothing else.  Good luck all.</li>
    <li> Shared with family and friends. Major complaint was more hair loss than usual, so many of us cannot continue use of product.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my wife. Very poor product, seems nice at first but then she started to notice a drastic abnormal  increase in hair falling out .Would not recommend for my dog after that.</li>
    <li> This product is OVER PRICED. One bottle is not a 30 day supply.&lt;br /&gt; you need to use much more than they state on the instructions&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY disappointed with this product line&lt;br /&gt; and just like most infomercials, it&#x27;s just crap....  A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for 26 months and absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that the pumps don&#x27;t seem to work when the container is down to about 1/3 full.&lt;br /&gt;This happens on every bottle I get. Have heard that you can add a little water to the bottle and it will work however for the price I don&#x27;t feel we should have to dilute the product to get the pump to work. Maybe someone could check into the problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months now. It is definitely the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I have fine, wavy, incredibly frizzy hair. This shampoo did not completely eliminate the frizz, but almost. Nothing else has come close to the results I&#x27;ve gotten from WEN. There&#x27;s only one drawback that I can think of: I used to be able to get away with washing my hair every third day, but I have to wash every other day with this stuff because my hair starts to look oily. Not surprising considering this shampoo&#x27;s claim to fame is that it does not overstrip oil from hair. But this might be a caution to those with oily hair/scalps. (My hair and scalp are on the drier side.)I think it&#x27;s a very small price to pay for better-behaving hair.</li>
    <li> Great product great price 😀</li>
    <li> I always, always use this brand.  This is my first almond mint.  Wonderful.  As other reviews, mine included, you must follow instructions for use.  Use enough product, hair must be totally wet and rinse rinse rinse.  I would never use any other product.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of this product, and before I declare it a stinker I will say that the Fig all in one may be a better fit for me. This almond mint cleanser hydrates satisfactorily but not to the extent I would have expected. I have shoulder length corkscrew curls that are color treated.     If you have dry hair, I&#x27;m going to say try another version of this, while the product will not dissapoint...I&#x27;m willing to bet...like me, the Almond Mint will not WOW ya.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my granddaughter and myself.  Her hair is problematic and this product has brought shine and manageability to her otherwise drab lifeless hair.  It has also helped bring the natural shine and body to my thin and fine graying hair with so little care.  Though the cost seems high, the products I don&#x27;t have to buy have made it a bargain and afforded us both with beautiful results as well as ease of care.</li>
    <li> When I washed my hair everyday with shampoo (no matter what brand and even when advertized as \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot;) it left my hair dry and frizzy.  And if I didn&#x27;t wash every day I could only go maybe two-three days at most-just rinsing and conditioning before it was too dirty and limp to stand.  WEN cleansing conditioner does what its name says.  It does clean the hair down to the scalp (I&#x27;m not sure how?!) and leaves it with lift and body, and smoothes down the frizzies.  I was skeptical that it would leave the hair oily and limp, but it doesn&#x27;t.       Unfortunately it is much more expensive than an equal amount of shampoo - which I would call its only major drawback.</li>
    <li> Again I love the product. My hair feels very healthy after using it.</li>
    <li> Once I get over no suds, I loved it!  Feels great on my hair and I love clean the smell!</li>
    <li> WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner works a miracle on my (Caucasian) frizzy/kinky hair!  It nourishes my hair and makes it soft and manageable. I love this product.  Thank you, Chaz Dean!</li>
    <li> Never had dry scalp/dandruff before using Wen. Major problems now. Very unsatisfactory. Hair and scalp not really clean and very dry. My set of products are going in the trash. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I love the way Wen makes my hair feel. My hair was hard to control and never soft before Wen. I have tried several of the different Wen types, but I love this one the most. My hair is silky, soft, and manageable. Wen is expensive but so worth it. I know longer have to use any other products to manage my hair so that is a factor in the cost. Thank you Chaz Dean!</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this product. I wash my hair everyday and was looking for a product that would be less drying and that would smooth my medium-thick asian hair.    I actually tried the sample pack with the three different varieties (cucumber, lavendar and sweet almond mint) hoping that I would find one formulation that I liked.  The verdict - my hair never felt clean and it was no softer/shinier than if I had used Pantene (my normal shampoo and conditioner).  I tried to follow the instructions properly  - you have to use alot of product - but my hair always felt like it had a thick residue on it.  For the price, this product should be life-altering and it&#x27;s far from it. Actually I would not even recommend it as a leave-in conditioner because it is quite heavy.  I do realize everyone has different hair types so this product may work differently for you. This has just been my experience and I hope it helps!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very expensive. It feels weird at first. And now, I won&#x27;t use anything else. I color and highlight my coarse hair and this is the first time my hair feels soft, &amp;#34;moves&amp;#34;, and doesn&#x27;t loose its color or shine as quickly. I tried all the product options suggested by others that were &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; Wen. None of them were like Wen- and I wanted them to be!  One note however, after I cleanse my hair and let it sit on my head for three minutes while finishing my shower, I add a small dollop of regular conditioner to just the ends of my hair and then rinse. I found if I didn&#x27;t do this, the ends of my hair would get kind of fly-away. I also don&#x27;t use as much as they suggest. I have shoulder length hair and I found if I let the product sit  longer and combed it through, my hair was just as smooth and silky. My husband uses Wen now, too, for his fine, &amp;#34;baby duck-like&amp;#34; hair. It gives his hair some style now- much better than when he uses regular shampoo. He also uses less product than recommended. Overall, I like it a lot, but would LOVE it if the price weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  The price was right, too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> My wife uses Suave shampoo and her hair always looks GREAT!! Those side by side comparisons on the info-mercial are hilarious! The non-using Wen girls look like they haven&#x27;t shampooed in a month! If they were to use my wife in the side by side, they would not sell any product.....O&#x27;wait, now I get it.</li>
    <li> I had a friend with long thick hair recommend this product to me, and I was a little hesitant. I have thin but very curly hair. I first tried the Almond Mint Cleanser and fell in love. I&#x27;ve recently tried the fig and have seen different (not as great results). I sometimes go back to my regular shampoo just to keep from overusing the product, but I really do like it. My hair was softer and I could actually run my fingers through it. And those with curly hair know that that may be a challenge. I haven&#x27;t tried the other cleansers but definitely recommend the almond mint!</li>
    <li> We have puschased this product for a number of years. Both directly from WEN and various local outlets. The convience of subscribing matches the WEN program and the additional price reduction from AMAZON makes them equal values.  What is the kicker is the service.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I have naturally curly and highlighted hair, which means that it also tends to be quite dry.  I have used it for a month now and have decided to let my hair grow out a little because it is so much easier to work with.  So the last time I went to my hairdresser for highlights, I said just to trim off the ends because I am letting it grow. She said I could skip a trim this month, because there weren&#x27;t any split ends.  This is a first.       I also use the \\&quot;sweet almond mint body, bath and hair oil\\&quot; after towel drying.  Probably about 12 small drops.  It makes my hair so soft.  Just don&#x27;t put too much on.  Experiment, but I guarantee if you have dry hair, using the oil, mainly on the ends will cure it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  I was worried at first that my hair wouldn&#x27;t feel clean, but it does and my way over-processed hair has come back to life!!  This product smells great, it cleans and conditions and my hair isn&#x27;t as dry and frizzy as it used to be!  I&#x27;ve actually gotten more compliments on my hair then ever.  I definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I saw this product one evening on an infomercial.  It intrigued me, but like any infomercial I was skeptical so I read many many reviews to see how well a cleansing conditioner worked.  I found mixed reviews.  I hate buying straight from infomercial sites, because 9/10 times there is usually an automatic renewal shipping which I hate (and WEN does).  So I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon, like everything else I can find on amazon.  I am a die hard amazon fan and devoted customer.  :)    Now on to the actual product review.  It took a little getting used to and I did see improved results after about a good month of use.  Meaning it took that long to adjust to how much I should use, technique, etc.  I was a die hard Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo / conditioner fan before I switched over.  I have finer hair that never really could get enough moisture from conditioners.  The ends would always feel dry, no matter how often I go for trims.  My hair would also snag and tangle easily also, as well as being really really frizzy.  This cleansing conditioner calmed my hair and really moisturized it.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, doesn&#x27;t look greasy, and I have no more fly away hairs.    My routine.  To give an idea of how much I use.  This is according to the 32 oz tall bottle (I found one pump from the tall bottle is about equal to 2 pumps from the small bottle - if you are pumping slow).  It is true, more is better.  I have medium to fine hair that comes to the bottom of my bra strap in the middle of my back.  I will wet down my hair thoroughly and apply 5-7 full slow pumps to the top of my head to start out.  I will then apply 3-5 slow pumps to the sides of my head by my temples, concentrating by my ear (which tends to be a grease spot for me if I do not clean there well enough).  I then apply about 10 slow pumps to the ends of the hair, working up to my scalp.  I will then pile my hair on top of my head and message while adding 2-3 pumps to the pile and work to theback of my head and nape of my neck.  I will then cup my hands to catch some water and splash it to the top of my head.  It may sound a bit ridiculous, but it does really help with promoting the lather (it doesn&#x27;t foam though).  I then let my hair down and take a fine tooth comb and comb through my hair once to remove tangles and dead loose hair (starting at the ends and working my way up).  I will then apply 2-3 more pumps, quickly message, and wind my hair up and clip it.  I leave my hair soak while I wash my body, face, shave, etc.  I then rinse my hair thoroughly.  This is so important - rinsing thoroughly.    The directions do recommend to give a 1-2 pump and message into the ends after showering as a leave in conditioner.  I do not leave any in.  I found that did make my hair look a bit greasy afterwords.  I would probably do that before swimming though, haven&#x27;t tried it yet though.    Once I exit the shower with thoroughly rinsed hair.  I will blot my hair dry with a towel, wet my hands, then apply two pumps of the WEN Sweet almond mint styling creme, concentrating at the ends and length of the hair.  I stay away from my temples, but what ever is left on my hands I will then run through the top of my head.  I do not blow dry my hair, I leave it dry naturally.    I think the most important thing that helps eliminate my fly aways is I do not comb or brush my hair when it is wet anymore (except while showering with the cleansing conditioner in it).  I just use my fingers until my hair is completely air dried, for my hair does not tangle anymore after using this cleansing conditioner.  I have noticed my hair is slowly becoming more wavy with body and I am finding less and less hair left in the drain of the shower.    I hope this reviewed helped and is a bit insightful.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used it for years</li>
    <li> From the first use, my hair was so soft and I could actually &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; my very thick hair with my fingers, while the  product was in my hair.  Before Wen,  my fingers would tangle in my hair and then just be hard to comb out .  Thanks Chaz, love the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I know the price seems high but I&#x27;ve checked around and this is about the best you can get.  I&#x27;ve been using WEN for about 5 years and I&#x27;ll  never go back to regular shampoo.  You will notice the difference after the first wash.  I know that sounds like an advertisement, but it&#x27;s true.  There are not harsh chemicals in this product that harm your hair.  You don&#x27;t need conditioner.  After shampooing, just put a small amount (about the size of a nickel) in your hand and work it through your hair.  Don&#x27;t rinse it out.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to regular shampoo. My hair is the healthiest it has ever been. I dye my hair and this product helps keep the color longer than ever before. I have sold my family, friends, co workers on this. The only thing I tell people is make sure you are patient and rinse it out completely!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wen has made my hair soft and shiny again, I absolutely love using it and think&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s worth every penny. I would never go back to regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have really dry hair and every since my gray really started coming in it&#x27;s very frizzy!  I&#x27;ve never had frizzy hair in my life!  Wen helps manage the friz and keeps it from drying out so much.  An added bonus I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day!</li>
    <li> She&#x27;s crazy about, next order will be the larger bottle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not much of a bargain buying the bigger bottle, but you don&#x27;t have to order as often is all.  I love this product.  I have seen such improvement in my curly/frizzy/dry looking hair since using Wen.</li>
    <li> Ok, this product takes patience &amp; an open mind! I&#x27;ve battled, suddenly, with dry scalp &amp; previously tried this product but didn&#x27;t take time to FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! I just bought it again &amp; I can officially say it is the best &amp; I&#x27;ll NEVER go back to regular &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;. Fist wet hair well put in alot of product, I start @ the front of my hair &amp; add product as I move to the nape of my neck, when I have enough Wen in I start to use the same scrub motion as I would w/ reg shampoo you have to scrub &amp; massage, then I&#x27;ll run fingers through to detangle &amp; ensure product is dispersed evenly, leave it on shave, wash up etc then rinse well, colder water works best &amp; just when you think it&#x27;s all out rinse some more! When I&#x27;m done I use 1 pump as leave in &amp; remember don&#x27;t be rough when drying your hair just wrap hair up &amp; let it dry no rubbing! It&#x27;s so good I just ordered a gallon size in Sweet Almond Mint! Try it!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is oily on top and dry on the ends,  I thought this was going to make my hair greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t.  It is actually helping it be healthier, especially the ends.  It feels great and smells great while using it.  Just be sure to thoroughly wet and rinse.</li>
    <li> My favorite. Haven&#x27;t used shampoo in 6 months - my hair is thicker (naturally) and shines.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff,  One shot, no need for conditioning.</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick, wavy hair which used to be really dry and frizzy and on the bushy side. After using Wen once my hair was completely transformed; the bushiness was cut in half instantly, the frizziness pretty much gone - for probably the first time ever I can let my hair air dry and it actually looks good! It extends my color so I dye much less frequently, my hair is healthier and shinier and has a natural bounce and movement to it, and it smells great. I love these big bottles so I never run out. I feel anyone who complains about a greasy feel isn&#x27;t following directions, I used hot water instead of cooler like they recommend and I did have greasy hair so I never did it again. The only downside is your hair get addicted to it, I ran out once and had to use regular shampoo and it turned my hair to straw, so now I get these big bottles so I am always prepared. Worth the extra money, I no longer buy conditioner or leave in conditioner and don&#x27;t have to dye as often, so the reality is your savings there almost cover the extra cost of the pricier product.</li>
    <li> I had thin limp hair - now it has life.  I bought some for my niece also.  She has curly, extra thick hair and she likes it too.</li>
    <li> I love WEN, it had done wonders for my hair.  Quick shipping and great packaging</li>
    <li> I am allergic to this product.  I got itchy on my head. I could not use it so I gave it to my friend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, I was sceptical but this really works, I am hooked.  Wish it was not so expensive as I am going to have to buy more!!!  My hair is soft, full and healthy after using this product, and believe me, my hair was stringy and dry beforehand, and I was having problems with breakage.  No more!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to love this product. It&#x27;s true. But with claims of a complete hair transformation after only one use, I had to break the infomercial barrier and purchase the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon the first use, I found the &amp;#34;cleansing process&amp;#34; uniquely odd. There indeed was no lather to speak of just as the product claims. I used my previous shampoo philsophy of less is more because 24 pumps seemed like far too much product. I left it on for the duration of my shower and rinsed it out as recommended. Hair transformation was partially achieved. My hair was fuller and shiny and not fly-away. (it&#x27;s dead of winter &#x27;round these parts killer on a gal&#x27;s hair) But, because i didn&#x27;t use enough product as recommended, I didn&#x27;t achieve my optimum results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned during my first experience that you should follow the instructions as specifically as possible. Go the distance! Once you follow exactly and use the maximum number of recommended pumps, you too will achieve hair greatness. The fact that ... Read more</li>
    <li> i have used it for over a year. just love what it does to my hair.what else can i say it is GREAT</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen conditioning cleansers on and off for about a year.  I tried 5 formulations and prefer fig and sweet almond mint.  I also like the lavender.  I tried to break this expensive habit but it is not possible.  I do not want to go back to that limp, frizzy and lackluster hair.  I am in my early 50&#x27;s and my hair was falling out in handfuls before I started this.  I have now grown my hair to shoulder length.  It is not what it was in my youth, but it is pretty darn good.  I switched to Aveda salon for my monthly color and the combination Wen and Aveda Invati scalp conditioner spray has brought my sad hair back to life.  It is still thinning a little but much better than it was.  Some day I may decide I just cannot afford all this hair pampering, but that will be sad day for my hair.  For all the negative reviews you have seen, it is questionable if directions were followed exactly.  I follow the directions exactly now including rinsing in cool water before and after cleansing.  it does take a longer time to wash my hair.  It comes out of the shower soaking wet so takes longer to dry too.  I can get by with washing and styling every other day.  Here is my routine:  I wash at night after coming home from gym.  I apply Aveda Phemolient and Wen styling cream to wet hair as directed.  I lightly dry on low setting with a round brush or vented brush.  I then roll the wet/damp hair up in large velcro rollers.  I keep the rollers in while I cook, eat dinner, etc. in the evening and then use the dryer to warm up the rollers before bed.  I take the rollers out right before bed and run my fingers through to smooth.  I comb it out completely in the morning adding some hair spray.  I rarely need to touch it up with an iron.  It looks full and bouncy with a hit of wave.  I cannot get straight hair unless a professional blows it out for me.  Some days it still looks good on the third day.  The time and money is, for now, a small price to pay for healthy looking hair at this point in my life.  You have to experiment with the styling products to find the right combo.  I have wavy, frizzy, course and thinning hair.  I can disguise it pretty well because it is full of shine and body now.  On weekends, I just let it dry naturally and it looks OK if a little messy.  I have received compliments even on my natural hair recently.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I barely use hair spray anymore when I&#x27;m styling my hair. I saw such a difference in the texture of my hair after using a week or so. Took a couple days to get used to the initial &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling from the product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this, pump didn&#x27;t work/ got a refund/ will get a smaller size next time</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product and while it did clean my hair, it is very tedious to use.  Plan on spending 10 more minutes in the shower if you have long hair, not to mention that we ALL need to conserve water in these times ( I live in CA where we have a serious draught).  Anyway, for that much more time and effort, I had hoped for my hair to be undeniably better.  My hair is long, long, straight, fine and delicate.  WEN definitely cleaned and conditioned but my hair ended up feeling a tad bit greasy.  I will stick to my normal routine.  Seller shipped right away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using wen products for years now. In the beginning,it took a little getting use to because we are all so use to having lather with shampoo. But this product cleans your scalp and is great for your hair. My hair is to the middle of my back but it&#x27;s healthy,shiny and always feels so clean after washing with this product. I like to buy this product on Amazon because on the wen website they put you on an auto plan which I did not want to have it shipped to me every 3 months.Again, great product, never will use any other shampoo or conditioner for my hair.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend only uses Wen and I just didn&#x27;t think it was worth the money  I started using it everyday now, for over six months, and when I am about to run out, I panic as I cannot just go to the drugstore and buy more.  There is something about Wen that I just love and will continue to use....  My hair feels clean and easy to style and I don&#x27;t use shampoo and conditioner any longer.</li>
    <li> I personally need to shampoo my roots still. I washed and washed and washed and I still had buildup under my nails from the natural oils, sweat and products I use on my hair during the days I don&#x27;t wash it. It is a lovely as a conditioner however and smells great. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this again because if I spend this much on something I want it to work and work better than this. I will finish using it because I paid so much but will continue searching for the perfect shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> This Wen shampoo is counterfeit! I contact the Wen company directly and they told me that they do not make the specific 32oz size bottle.</li>
    <li> A great way to buy this great shampoo without having to deal with the telemarketers. I will purchase this product again</li>
    <li> I am a caucasian with average/dry wavy hair and have now been using Wen for about a year and a half. I have been dying my hair crazy colors for years. I&#x27;ve tried all the shampoos and conditioners out there and this is the BEST! This is very gentle, but does a good job cleansing. I use the got2be Glued Blasting Freeze Spray hairspray and Wen gets it out in one wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I dye my hair the color usually lasts about one month before it is super faded, but Wen makes it last for two months! One thing to note, Wen is so good at not stripping out the color that for the first week after I dye my hair, some hair color usually comes off onto my pillow case - so throw a dark one on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried Wen, my hair felt a little greasier or waxier than normal for the first couple weeks. Now that my hair is used to it, it just feels healthy and silky. I get compliments all the time on the vibrant color, and how healthy it feels. Since I don&#x27;t use shampoo anymore - just Wen, I think it has saved me money over all.</li>
    <li> this is one of the nicest smelling scents ive used so far! it also seemed to make my hair softer and not dried out like some of the others ive tried. I like the seasonal ones but I like to buy the sample packets to try them all and so far im impressed with this one!</li>
    <li> it works well for my wife , she will be ordering more soon , it a bit different with no suds.&lt;br /&gt;thanks R</li>
    <li> It sure did, I loved when for the first I purchased some back in 2011. I love how it dangles with you having to comb through your hair. I really love it for that reason+.</li>
    <li> Not sure whether this is authentic stuff. I used wen before and it did miracle to my hair, this product from amazon simply damaged my hair.</li>
    <li> do your hair a favor and you wont regret it.  its expensive, but worth it.  consider it a spa treatment for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!  I color my hair and now I only have to get my hair colored every 3-4 months because this shampoo keeps the color in so well...  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> this product, and scent is amazing, absolutely love it, wen is a great product, this is a great scent!. .</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have dry, coarse, ethnic hair and I switch between the Tea Tree and the Six Thirteen.  They both work very well for my natural curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used WEN for two years straight when I went natural.  Then in an effort to save money I went to a cheaper non-sulfate shampoo that you can get at the grocery store.  My hair stayed dry and I kept trying to figure out the right product to keep the curls bouncy and soft.  I ended up spending way more money than if I&#x27;d just gotten the WEN.  So I went back and the spring in my coils has returned!  Lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were reviewing strictly the product, I would have given it 5 stars.  I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars here because of Amazon&#x27;s price.  $73 for the 32 oz is ridiculous. Que Vee Cee has this same thing for $49.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. I have used this product for 10 months and my hair is &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34;. That is all I ever hear. My color no longer fades and the texture is silky. I have fine, curly, mostly grey (under color) hair. It was always dry, frizzy and only a pro could tame it into a nice style. It is now shoulder length, shiny,thicker than ever before. Did I say it was the real deal? Try it once and you will see a difference. use it for for a few months and all your other hair products will go into the trash. I only use two items now. Wen to shampoo, wen as a leave in and a root lifter, everyday.</li>
    <li> love it, love it, love it.  leaves hair so soft and clean. it is pricey but if you scour amazon regularly you can find it at varying prices from different sellers.  completely recommend this product, especially if you can wean yourself off other products that continually leave residue in your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and love it.  It makes my hair very shiny and isn&#x27;t harsh.  For first time users, it will not suds up like other shampoos but it is a great cleanser and includes a conditioner in the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I first ordered this on QVC.  Chaz Dean was a little cooky, but I was sold when he did an on-air shampoo test on dyed hair and showed color draining away with reg shampoo.  I bought it and have not used anything else in 3 years. I do not miss lather shampoo. Wen prob isn&#x27;t for everyone. For example, I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day as it does use a lot of product and would prob be expensive when you could use a clarifying shampoo if you need daily hair washing.  They have a few formulas/scents but the two I like best are tea tree and sweet almond mint.  Both really clean your hair and have a subtle smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, slightly coarse Asian hair that gets oily and strangely looks better 2-3 days dirty!  I love that I can use this every other day and it makes my hair look AMAZING.  I am dead serious that I can let my straight hair air-dry with Wen and it looks great. No blow drying or anything. My hair is shiny, healthy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit it takes a while to get used to in regards to how much product to pump and where to apply in your hair. It is also a little pricey. Otherwise, I really like Wen!</li>
    <li> ALWAYS A HIT!  WEN PRODUCTS ARE THE BEST!</li>
    <li> I had purchased a smaller size before and loved it.  Wen does clean without the foam like the other shampoos.  Hair stayed cleaner and shiner.  Will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Amazing product at an Amazing price!  I&#x27;ve paid alot more for this but NEVER less.  The fact that Wen does not contain the sudsy sulfates that other  shampoos do is what makes the big difference.  Using this for the past 4 months has made an incredible difference in my otherwise wiry, stiff, hard to manage hair.  The lady who cuts my hair told me about Wen and how that it would repair my hair.  Well credit where credit is due:  It really has been very good on my hair.  The pump normally stops working when the level gets fairly low.  But there is still plenty left when this happens.  So I went to Wal Mart&#x27;s beauty aisle (with my wife so I wouldn&#x27;t get stares) and found a cheap bottle with a screw on flip top cap.  Now when the pump stops working I funnel the remainder of the Wen into this bottle and give it a couple squeezes when its time to wash my hair (I&#x27;ve learned to cut an air vent into the bottom of the inverted bottle when funneling.  I&#x27;ve also learned to put a soda straw thru the funnel into the receiving bottle too.  Now I don&#x27;t miss a drop of this precious Wen shampoo when transferring it to my squeeze bottle.)</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend this product. It really does condition your hair and is worth the price. A nice product and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me and I decided to try it.  As always, I figured bigger is better so I purchased the large size.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I love the fragrance of the product and the way it leaves my hair.  I have noticed some improvement in texture and handling so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Ok, this product takes patience &amp; an open mind! I&#x27;ve battled, suddenly, with dry scalp &amp; previously tried this product but didn&#x27;t take time to FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! I just bought it again &amp; I can officially say it is the best &amp; I&#x27;ll NEVER go back to regular \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot;. Fist wet hair well put in alot of product, I start @ the front of my hair &amp; add product as I move to the nape of my neck, when I have enough Wen in I start to use the same scrub motion as I would w/ reg shampoo you have to scrub &amp; massage, then I&#x27;ll run fingers through to detangle &amp; ensure product is dispersed evenly, leave it on shave, wash up etc... then rinse well, colder water works best &amp; just when you think it&#x27;s all out rinse some more! When I&#x27;m done I use 1 pump as leave in &amp; remember don&#x27;t be rough when drying your hair just wrap hair up &amp; let it dry no rubbing! It&#x27;s so good I just ordered a gallon size in Sweet Almond Mint! Try it!</li>
    <li> This product is the best.  I have thick hair and regular shampoo was okay, but when I saw this advertised on T.V. and saw the difference in the models hair, thought i&#x27;d try it.  Regular shampoo tends to make my hair frizzier than I&#x27;d like.  This shampoo was GREAT.  Tried the sweet almond mint.  When I got low on the product I saved it for &#x27;special occasions&#x27; until I could re-order.  I&#x27;m ordering the lavendar to try that.  The sweet almond mint smelled great and was invigorating on my scalp.  For my hair, this product works.  Really soft hair and I feel wonderful.  Do directions to a &#x27;t&#x27; and hopefully it will work for you as it&#x27;s worked for me.</li>
    <li> I have fine color treated hair and this leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking.  I notice my color doesn&#x27;t fade at all.  It saves time in the shower too since there is only one step. I&#x27;ll never switch back to regular shampoo! For those who didn&#x27;t like it I wonder if you used too much/not enough, didn&#x27;t rinse well..?</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I was extremely skeptical about this product becuz most infomercial products are cr*p, but I was totally desperate and after researching it on QVC, Amazon, and reading numerous reviews on it, I decided to take a chance and slap down the $55. I received this exact cleansing conditioner by itself in the mail over a week ago and I&#x27;ve used it for 8 straight days now.....OMG!!! It works EXACTLY as promised (huge surpise to me!!) I seriously cannot believe how soft my hair is. I am 37yrs old and if I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single morning, by noon it is a total greaseball! However, when I DID wash it every morning with normal shampoo, it was dry and brittle. I could never get a happy medium. Before buying this stuff, I also tried using just conditioner (no shampoo) on my hair, thinking it would probably get the same results as this stuff. Nope, it was totally greasy by noon. Using Wen Almond cleansing conditioner makes my hair perfectly soft and hydrated thruout the entire day (like it was when I was 22!) without ANY greasiness! Just follow the instructions EXACTLY as they read on the bottle: I personally...1) Run water completely thru hair first 2) I use 12 pumps of Wen on my hair cuz my hair is very thin and just past my shoulders 3) I massage it in really good 4) I thoroughly comb thru my hair so the Wen is completely distributed 5) I pile it all on top of my head and put a shower cap over it 6) then I shower for 5 minutes with it soaking in 7) then I rinse completely for at least 3 minutes and towel/air dry. I use a non-sulfate clarifying shampoo once every 10 days. That&#x27;s it!! This stuff rocks and I&#x27;ll probly use it the rest of my life!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair behave. For me or causes a buildup, so I wash once a week with a lathering shampo</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to love this product.  It&#x27;s true. But with claims of a complete hair transformation after only one use, I had to break the infomercial barrier and purchase the product.     Upon the first use, I found the \\&quot;cleansing process\\&quot; uniquely odd.  There indeed was no lather to speak of just as the product claims. I used my previous shampoo philsophy of less is more because 24 pumps seemed like far too much product.  I left it on for the duration of my shower and rinsed it out as recommended. Hair transformation was partially achieved. My hair was fuller and shiny and not fly-away. (it&#x27;s dead of winter &#x27;round these parts... killer on a gal&#x27;s hair) But, because i didn&#x27;t use enough product as recommended, I didn&#x27;t achieve my optimum results.     I learned during my first experience that you should follow the instructions as specifically as possible.  Go the distance! Once you follow exactly and use the maximum number of recommended pumps, you too will achieve hair greatness. The fact that it costs as much as a small island to purchase is irrelevant! For the win!</li>
    <li> This product has made my hair so soft and moisturized, and it is faster to wash my hair with WEN than regular shampoo and conditioner.  WEN is a single step wash, apply it as soon as you get in the shower, leave it in while you bathe, shave, etc., then rinse it out right before you get out of the shower.  I ordered the Sweet Almond Mint, the scent is great, and it gives my scalp a pleasant tingly feeling.  I love it... I am definately hooked on this product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen on my shoulder-blade length, color treated hair for 4 months now, and love it. It smells great, has identifiable ingredients, and leaves my hair clean, shiny, and looking beautiful. I generally do not wash my hair every day, and do use some light styling product, and Wen does not leave me greasy at all. Highly recommend for anyone with long hair, or trying to grow it out.</li>
    <li> My hair was so dry and brittle, and I think my hair ate the WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner and what ever moisture it gave it. It&#x27;s softer and moisturize and not dry and hard like before, and it&#x27;s like silk when cleansing your hair with it. It&#x27;s only been a week and used it three times I am going to use it a few more times this week to make my final answer on whether I am a WEN Girl.   Cons: Goes to fast and expensive :(  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pureology for several years with very good results but, decided to branch out and try the much-vaunted Wen products.  No and no and no...I followed Chaz&#x27; detailed instructions and got the softness but my highlighted hair seemed unshiny and without the depth of color I was used to.  I live in a high humidity state and am very aware that some hair products don&#x27;t seem to work as well here so it may be that.  But I used Wen religiously for 2 weeks and will not go back.  It&#x27;s stored on the top shelf of my closet in the Shampoo Rejects section.</li>
    <li> Wife loves Wen. I&#x27;ve seen bad reviews, albeit they are infrequent compared to the good ones. Wife and kids all use Wen and love it.</li>
    <li> awesome stuff  thank u</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with classic WEN!</li>
    <li> I have old white hair and it need lots of care. This works great for my hair type.</li>
    <li> JULY 1, 2015 HAPPY CANADA DAY!  I saw the infomercial as well and after I saw the results and was impressed I wanted to purchase the $29.95 kit hoping I would see a difference as expressed in the ad.  I instantly felt a wonderful difference in my hair immediately upon the first application. I have thick, blond colour treated, straight hair and saw a complete transformation. OMG body, shine and softness and I have been a WEN GIRL since 2012.  I only need to wash my hair once a week but is it constantly soft and shiny and would only need to wash every 10 days. It is longer than shoulder length so I do wear it up a lot but everyone has wonderful comments on my locks.  I am very proud of my hair and would absolutely die if something happened to it. But as we get older  I am 65 years of age and find my hair is falling out a lot after each treatment.  I have my hair cut 4 times a year and complained to my hairdresser that I was losing my hair and was concerned. She reassured me that I had tons of hair and it is a normal process to shed in the spring and it grows during the summer with the heat and the sun. After reading the reviews of those who wrote a comment which I find very helpful I may have a look at Sally&#x27;s and perhaps change my shampoo routine. I also use to use Pantene Pro V which I did love but thought I was due for a change. However, I will not give up &amp;#34;Sweet Almond MInt Re-Moist Intensive Hair Treatment&amp;#34; as I use this product after every wash of cleaning conditioner and leave it in all night especially after I colour my hair, My hair is like silk but  I miss the smell. I ask my boyfriend what does my hair smell like and he says like hair maybe this is a typical reply from the male saide but I think clean hair shoud have a scent.  I thought my hair use to smell great with a fresh glorious fragrance and now it does not but it does look gorgeous. So I will accept that as it is more than manageable. I must admit please use the suggested pumps to get your hair feeling like it is clean.  It does not lather in any regard and it does take a bit of time to adapt. I believe a change is as good as a rest so I will find it in my heart to try the shampoo from Sally&#x27;s that is like Wen for a period of time.when my Wen Cleaning Conditioner runs out and then stay tune for part 2. Keep up your helpful reviews as they are all extremely helpful.</li>
    <li> I love using the Wen products, this is my favorite one.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo, have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I have to say I love this stuff. My hairdresser keeps asking me what I&#x27;m doing to grow thicker hair and I keep telling her WEN. She says it&#x27;s not possible as in order to grow hair, it&#x27;s what goes into your body not on top of your head. Well, I am making her into a believer. I seldom if ever use shampoo. This keeps my color longer, too. I like this and the cucumber best. I do not like the lavender.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is perfect for those looking for a product that adds a lot of moisture to the hair.  It leaves my hair tangle free and well conditioned.  Before using the product my hair was dry, tangled easily and limp.  Works well on my African- American hair.</li>
    <li> The BEST shampoo on the market.  I love it for the volume and control it gives me.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. You should definitely use for a month before deciding.  After my first bottle that I received as a gift, I went back to regular shampoo.  Immediately bought WEN as soon as possible.  The cost is more up front but last longer and you won&#x27;t need any other products so in the long run saves you money. I rarely even use hairspray anymore and then just to hold down the stray hairs on top. I have fine, straight hair and its amazing not too heavy at all. Took about 2 months of using it only for my hair to stop producing all the extra oil. Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> BEWARE!  This is not Wen. After several washes I noticed a significant difference in the appearance of my hair.  I thought maybe my hair had adjusted to the Wen so I wasn&#x27;t getting the same results.  I finished the bottle.  In the meantime I had ordered another bottle directly from Wen and after one wash my hair was noticably improved.  By day three it looked great again!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for just under a year and I love it.  The almond mint is such a great scent.  It takes a few washes to get used to how it works, but it leaves my hair in incredible condition.  I use it as a leave in conditioner also despite the fact that my hair is somewhat fine.  Using it helps my colored red hair maintain its first week look much longer.</li>
    <li> For the most part, I am very pleased.  I have very fine, straight hair.  My hair now has body, yes body!  That is something I never thought I could say about my hair.  It has body!  At least, when I flip it or run my fingers through it, it stays there (with no gel or anything) and looks layered and styled and fabulous, like it could be in a magazine ad.  Before, you couldn&#x27;t even see my layers.  Now there are waves, and I love it!  I love it!  You can&#x27;t even imagine the difference and how much more my hair feels alive. It&#x27;s bouncy and light.  The best part is that it&#x27;s light.  I used to think my hair was just heavy and flat and there was nothing I could do about it.  Turns out it was my shampoo.  Now it&#x27;s so light, I can actually grow my hair longer.  Before, I couldn&#x27;t have it too long or the weight of it would make it uncomfortable and send me running for a haircut.  Now, it&#x27;s midway down my back and I don&#x27;t feel it at all.  It&#x27;s wonderful.    As for why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars and not 5:  It&#x27;s rather expensive.  It&#x27;s 5x more than I used to spend on Pantene, and I use a lot more product now.  If you follow the directions closely it takes a long time to wash your hair, or at least to get the hang of washing it.  There&#x27;s a lot of combing involved.  Getting the right amount of product is tricky.  I don&#x27;t use nearly as much as they recommend, and so if I don&#x27;t use enough, my hair can get oily quickly.  Also, I think you do have to wash your hair with another shampoo once in a while, as another reviewer mentioned, or product builds up and you&#x27;ll feel it in your hair.    Otherwise, I really love this product.  I&#x27;ve never spent so much time or money on my hair, but now that I touch it and look at it, I&#x27;m glad I do.  I should mention that when I do use the right amount, I can go days without washing my hair and it doesn&#x27;t get that yucky icky feeling like with other shampoos.  And sometimes QVC has good deals on it.  The other great thing is that I used to shed all the time,everywhere, and there&#x27;s much less of that.  I&#x27;m pulling on my hair now and no hairs are coming out.  That&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> This works really nice, but is extremely overpriced. I now use the generic version available at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, for a third of the price. For my hair, I think it actually works better.</li>
    <li> I went back and forth about buying this product for about a month before I finally made the purchase.  I thought it was expensive and wasn&#x27;t sure I should believe the claims about how it worked.  However, I decided to try it for two reasons.    1).  My 9 year old son has had an extremely itchy scalp for over a year and nothing we have tried has worked to relieve the itching.  I felt sorry for him, and for that alone, I probably would have tried it.  I am happy to report that after only a few washes he has not itched at all!  This is the first product we&#x27;ve tried that we have had even close to that result.    2).  My 41 year old hair would look dull, dry and lifeless only two weeks after spending well over $100 to have it professionally color treated.  I was looking for a product to bring some life, lift and shine back.  This product has worked tremendously in that respect.    I feel like I should qualify my recommendation.  I started using this product 1 month ago the day after having my hair colored, so that I could truly see how different it was from previous color treatments.  I could tell a difference after only a couple of days of using it, however, after a week of using it my hair felt weighed down and not particularly clean.  So, I decided to try a different approach:  Use it for 2 out of every three days, and then on the third day use my shampoo and conditioner purchased at my hair salon.  For me that&#x27;s a perfect combination.  And, it does cut down some on the cost -- so it&#x27;s a win/win!    Don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell of the product -- kind of mediciny smelling, but when it&#x27;s rinsed out it really leaves your hair smell free, so I don&#x27;t consider that a true negative.        I went to have my hair treated today after using this product for the past month and my hair dresser commented that my hair felt softer than usual and that he noted a lot of new growth.  That&#x27;s without being told that I had switched product.  So, I&#x27;m hooked and will continue to purchase this product.    I give it 4 stars only because I do think it&#x27;s over-priced.  However, in spite of that I will continue to purchase it because of the results.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the WEN Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner.  My hair is fine and I have a natural wave to it.  I use about 15 pumps for just above shoulder length hair and leave it in while I finish my shower.  Before drying my hair, I use the WEN Sweet Almond Mint styling creme on the ends of my hair.  I live in a very humid climate and the WEN cleansing conditioner stops the frizz and give my hair body.  I would recommend this product to anyone with fine hair that frizzes easily.  The reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is I still feel the need to use a regular shampoo about every 4th or 5th time I wash my hair, so it doesn&#x27;t go limp.</li>
    <li> I break the rules!  I have almost-shoulder length hair and I use only 2-3 pumps every day.  I make sure I comb it through my hair with a wide-tooth comb at the start of my shower, leave it in and rinse at the end of my shower.  A 32-oz. bottle lasts me 6 months.  I live in a very hot and humid climate, and before I switched to Wen, my hair color always went brassy and my hair looked and felt dry and rough.  Now I get compliments on how smooth and shiny it is.  Been using it about a year, and I will never switch back!</li>
    <li> I started using WEN in January and decided I loved it.  I needed to re-order, and was not looking forward to the cost.  Based on another reviewer&#x27;s response, I tried the Sally Beauty Supply version of this cleansing conditioner.  I love it!  It&#x27;s much less expensive and I do think I like it better than WEN.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my dry frizzy hair. I use it as both a cleansing and leave in conditioner.  It leaves my hair soft and curly, without feeling like there&#x27;s a lot of product left in my hair.  Wen is very worth the price. This is great stuff!</li>
    <li> I bought this product from the infomercial- big mistake. They claim that it&#x27;s for all hair lengths, textures and types and it is not. I have medium length curly hair which gets oily if I dont wash it regularly. This shampoo made my hair flat and greasy. When I called to cancel they tried to talk me into trying a product that would be better suited for my hair type- what a scam! And beware- they lock you into automatic billing/shipping when you initially order- I didnt realize it until it was too late.</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair and I have been using WEN Cleansing Conditioner for a year now.  The PROS - great hair product with no harsh ingredients, gently cleans your hair without damaging it and best of all you will get compliments for great looking hair.  The CONS - quite pricey, once you&#x27;ve tried it you&#x27;re hooked and you can&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo.      There are other sulfate-free shampoos out there that I&#x27;ve tried (Burt&#x27;s Bees, Loreal) but the results are just not the same.</li>
    <li> Amazing! My hair is so much healthier after using it for only a week!</li>
    <li> I actually just use this as a leave in conditioner; I don&#x27;t use it as a shampoo.  It is a bit expernsive, but as a leave in conditioner it lasts much longer.  (one to one and half pumps is all I use).  It&#x27;s one of the best natural leave in conditioners that I can find that isn&#x27;t full of toxic ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo without all the annoying foam. Quick delivery and better price than dealing direct with manufacturer. Will continue to purchase from this distributor.</li>
    <li> love WEN!  It really has made a tremendous difference in my hair in the year I have been using it.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Hair has more body.</li>
    <li> I love wen shampoo! I read recently  read that someone was suing wen because their hair fell out. I however did not have that experience. My hair feels really soft and it smells great too! The only bad side is that this shampoo isn&#x27;t exactly cheap and you also have to us a lot of it or if you don&#x27;t your hair can appear greasy.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and the shampoo left my hair very flat,  nice shine, great smell and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great product and love the larger size.</li>
    <li> The Wen cleansing conditioner is  absolutely wonderful. It give my hair body shine and a healthy feeling. It seemed strtange at first not to have the foaming bubbles of regular shampoo but works awesome. I would recommend it to any one</li>
    <li> Beware...I have been using Wen for 2 years and tried to buy it on Amazon (which I love)...When I got the product immediately I noticed that the bottle was sealed wen actually is not sealed.  I usually buy it from Sephora,  I used it the next morning and immediately knew something was wrong.  It smelled way to minty.  Felt like a ton of oil in my hair.  My hair now is flat and completely unmanageable.  I actually compared the labels and my wen has the trademark sign this one did not.  FAKE!!!  I once tried a generic from Sally&#x27;s this was very similar.  Very unhappy for $70...Well I will never purchase this off of Amazon or this distributor.  Very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I love my Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner.  I tried others but I love Sweet Almond Mint, it seems to work on my hair the best.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but this stuff really helps to make my hair soft and smell great,  and I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s especially good for curly hair like mine. The only thing my hairdresser recommended was to switch it up between regular shampoo/conditioner and this - since the whole idea behind Wen is to not clean your hair, so as to leave in the natural oils. Since I straighten my hair so much, it helps to supplement my commercial shampoo with something more soothing and gentle on my hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great product. Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> My fiancee and I have been using this stuff for about a year. Finally, last week, she said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t think this stuff is any better than what we used to use.&amp;#34; And, at the price!!! Crazy expensive. Unless you have incredibly horrible hair, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Yes this is a little spendy, but it was worth it! Got it 3 days after I ordered it with normal shipping! Never using a different shampoo again!</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve used !</li>
    <li> I first ordered this on QVC. Chaz Dean was a little cooky, but I was sold when he did an on-air shampoo test on dyed hair and showed color draining away with reg shampoo. I bought it and have not used anything else in 3 years. I do not miss lather shampoo. Wen prob isn&#x27;t for everyone. For example, I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day as it does use a lot of product and would prob be expensive when you could use a clarifying shampoo if you need daily hair washing. They have a few formulas/scents but the two I like best are tea tree and sweet almond mint. Both really clean your hair and have a subtle smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, slightly coarse Asian hair that gets oily and strangely looks better 2-3 days dirty! I love that I can use this every other day and it makes my hair look AMAZING. I am dead serious that I can let my straight hair air-dry with Wen and it looks great. No blow drying or anything. My hair is shiny, healthy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit it takes a while to get used to in regards to how much... Read more</li>
    <li> The pump did not work so I have the huge bottle with no easy way to get shampoo out.  I love the shampoo itself.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair very dull looking.</li>
    <li> As long as I&#x27;ve been a hairstylist I&#x27;ve never came across a product as amazing as wen I noticed a complete difference just after the first wash as many other stylist know  that we love to change our hair as much as we blink and my hair is platinum blonde and is extremely over prosessed now my hair is shiny soft has body and when I don&#x27;t blow dry it straight my curls are amazing I&#x27;ve never had a product work so good I will never go back I&#x27;m addicted to wen and so is everyone in my family now I know what to get all the girls in my family for Christmas I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about six months now after a very bad infomercial habit and a very bad cold collided (I blame the cough syrup.) Anyhow, this was the only product I purchased during my binge that actually was any good.  In order for it to work, however, one must really be \\&quot;listening\\&quot; to their hair; i.e. Using your hands, fingers, brain to see how much to use, etc. One tip I do have is to definitely be rinsing and scrubbing while using the product in a COOL temperature shower. I know everyone loves a hot shower, but it isn&#x27;t good for your skin, hair, etc. anyway. Another huge tip is to make sure that when rinsing to scrub for an additional 60 seconds after you think it has rinsed, seriously count to 60! I am completely addicted and now recommend the product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with my hair my whole life until I found Wen.  I will never buy anything else.  This is the best product and believe me I have tried them all.  I have thick, frizzy, oily hair.  I have been using WEN for 5 months and I will never switch.  It is a dream come true.  Give it a try.  I promise you it will be thest best $$ you ever spent on your hair.</li>
    <li> I really like the Wen sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner.  It does a great job on my fine hair.  The only problem is it&#x27;s price....$52 for 32 oz.  I would like to continue using it, but at over $1.50+ an ounce, it&#x27;s not likely that I will buy again.  I bought it as a Christmas present for me so I splurged.  It&#x27;s not in my budget to spend this much again.</li>
    <li> Best cleansing product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Almond Mint for over a year, my hair has grown so long, it has shine and body, and feels soft!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is just wonderful !  Other cleansers wash out color, but this one does not! Leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I wanted to LOVE this shampoo...the ratings seemed to be too good to be true so I had to try it. The claims just aren&#x27;t true. My hair has the same texture, feel, look, etc. And my color lasts not one day longer than it did using regular shampoo and conditioner. The one step process is nice, but for the price and with all its claims, this product is just way overpriced and somewhat disappointing.</li>
    <li> Wen by Chaz Dean is a high-pressure credit card fraud. I have received six  packages of Wen product that I did not authorize. I did not sign up for an automatic monthly package. I was unsatisfied with the quality of this product after the first use. When I tried to cancel, I was given a 30-minute hard-sell but patiently persisted. Even though I received an online cancellation confirmation, they charged my credit card three weeks later. This is unethical business practice and I&#x27;m frankly surprised this company continues to get away with it. I fully expect them to charge me again and I expect to have to change my credit card number to get this madness to stop.</li>
    <li> Best Product on the Market. Used as a Hair Conditioner !!!!</li>
    <li> I have used in product for years, it is great for very dry hair.  They really mean it when they say it doesn&#x27;t lather, and you only need to use a small amount.</li>
    <li> I find I need to wash the front of my hair with regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite haircare product! I&#x27;ve used this for 5 years now. I have long, thick, curly hair that is no longer frizzy &amp; unmanageable.  I don&#x27;t have to wash it as often either.. I buy it by the gallon now &amp; transfer it to the smaller container for shower use. There is a tendency for residue build up over time, so I do a vinegar rinse right before applying the cleansing conditioner every time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, however, it is only 49.95 0n qvc and no, you do not have to get auto delivery. Make sure you order the correct formula for your type of hair. ex: lavender for fine, thin hair, fig for dry, damaged and coarse hair. Anyone can use any of the formulas, just make sure you experiment. qvc lets you return if you don&#x27;t like. just sayin.</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to since it does not lather but I absolutely LOVE this product.  My hair is much more manageable and does not break off as much.  Will never use regular shampoo or conditioner again.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. Will never use shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I love Wen cleansing conditioner by Chaz Dean.  When I use any other shampoo and conditioner my hair feels like straw.  My Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner actually makes my hair feel healthy and if I curl my hair, the curl stays in all day.  I cannot be without my Wen.  Love, love, love it!!!</li>
    <li> Wen works great. Try this cheaper method first.. Wash your hair with salon conditioner that you already have in your shower. Don&#x27;t forget to skip your shampoo. The results are identical and at least $30 cheaper. You will be amazed. Don&#x27;t believe me? Try it on a day you would wear a hat anyway, only you won&#x27;t be needing your hat.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001800I44 Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, 32oz]]    Well, I must say, I have been there , done that one......I have to tell you, I am 45 years old, and my hair has always been the best feature of mine ( at least to me i believe, LOL) ....Now, as i have grown older and color treated my hair since i was 16, you can imagine the damage and torment I have put my hair through......Although I have taken good care and bought what i thought was the best hair products to keep my hair healthy, None of them worked for me,.....I just used what i thought was good and kept buying from the hair salons.....I have bought almost every hair product available out there on the market.....anything from Nexus to Paul Mitchell to Kerasilk to you name it, i bought it.....I noticed with age, my hair was thinning and with every year, I started getting scared and always told my hair dresser that i am going bald. ....She always laughs at me BUT she did say yes, it is thinning and i am always losing hair in the drain when i wash my hair...this has been going on for years, i am almost out of hair......Literally, i have lost almost all my hair and  now i can say, that when i was younger and had the thick and curly hair which i HATED back then, i wish i had half of it back now,,,,,Getting back to the product, I watched the informercial and thought OH, here we go again, just another product to take your money.... it can&#x27;t possibly work, the product does not even lather up, how can a cream clean and wash your hair correctly? If it is such a great product, then why aren&#x27;t the hair salons using it on your hair when you go to them for hair treatments or whatever????.........Well, Of course i could NOT resist the temptation to try it out....what did i have to lose except MORE OF MY HAIR right? Well, I got it and tried it and believe me, i DO NOT have much hair to wash trust me anymore BUT, it did indeed make a difference in the feeling, it is so much more shinier, and believe it or not i actually am starting to get compliments on my hair, (what i have left of it that is).......The other positive thing is my hair is NOT falling out NEAR AS MUCH AS IT WAS, i am hoping it stops totally falling out, i am at the point of considering hair extensions OR transplant hair, i am serious, that is how much hair i have lost due to years and years of coloring, styling, frosting, flat ironing it, ect.....I eat pretty good so i can&#x27;t blame it on my diet, i hope i have no unknown serious illness that i am not aware of that is responsible for my hair loss and as for genetics, it does not run in the family so i am going to assume i did all the damage to my hair myself...I am  now trying to redeem my hair mistakes and this is why i am buying this product along with the fact that it does WORK for me, i was surprised and happy with it...  The price is costly  but now i do NOT wash my hair every day, with this product you don&#x27;t have to wash it daily, at least I DO NOT HAVE TO,( i am speaking for myself through my experience with the product)...also. i have to agree with others in the sense of the amount of product you use, the bottle is NOT a 60 or 90 day supply, NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THAT, i have little hair and the bottle don&#x27;t last me long at all....that is the negative side of this product, you have to use alot of it, and it does NOT last long for the price......overall, i love it, it works BUT you have to use it correctly, and be able to afford it long term to see a major difference....i have using this for about a year now...i have length growth and less hair loss......i just hope it maybe can help with the new regrowth of hair, that would  be awesome and if that does happen, I will definitely never go back to regular shampooing   :)    I have been faithful for one year so far, nothing major but definitley helped my hair issues thus far......</li>
    <li> lasted me a long long time. was so worth it not to worry about running out. Always loved the product. I&#x27;m just trying to convince you to go big this time.</li>
    <li> Was totally disappointed by this product.  It is so heavy and left my hair feeling weighed down and greasy.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have found my new product of a lifetime!! It smells wonderful and minty, it applies creamy and rinses clean. I noticed a difference on the first use and that has not changed in 2 weeks. I get compliments now where as before my hair looked very dry. Thank you WEN!</li>
    <li> I Love this product. Makes my fine, dry hair so soft.  The scent is awesome. Yes, is expensive, but so worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product for my hair that damages easily</li>
    <li> This product makes you love your hair! Wen gives my curls natural shape, healthy shine, and softness with less tangle.</li>
    <li> Great product for normal or color treated hair.  Makes your hair soft and very managable!  Great all in one product!</li>
    <li> I chose this product so that I could attempt to keep my hair hydrated from my daily washing.... which is a necessity until the day that grody helmet hair becomes a trend. My previous shampoo &amp; conditioner was starting to cause break outs on my forehead so I researched and tried to this out (I tried it out while I was in college but was causing a grease head because I was using it incorrectly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair specs:&lt;br /&gt;Daily wash&lt;br /&gt;Medium thickness, wavy hair, about shoulder length&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash method (after a month):&lt;br /&gt;-I make sure my hair is sopping wet before applying the product... probably the most important step IMO. The entire wash is done in warm/hot water&lt;br /&gt;-I apply 4 pumps total daily, every few days I will do 4 pumps + rinse + 4 more pumps to &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34;. Scalp, 2 sides and nape each get a pump of it.&lt;br /&gt;-Rinse for a couple of minutes, massaging in water like a hair stylist would&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards - I mostly air dry and it makes my wavy hair really stand out if I place in 1/4 pump at ends as leave in conditioner. If I want to blow dry my hair I will use a pump of Kerastase Elixir Ultime which is an amazing product instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it an OK because for the price it performs similar to other products that are half the price. I may try the Fig and see if different ones will make differences for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN for 2 years now and would never go back to a chemical shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought my WEN from the actual website, not on Amazon. I thought Wen products were amazing when I first started to use it. My hair looked beautiful and shiny, and I already had really great hair. About a 3-4 weeks into using the product, I noticed clumps and clumps of hair clogging the drain. The same thing happened to my mother, who started using it a few days after me (I used the almond one and she used the cucumber one). We&#x27;re both white, she&#x27;s a brunette and I&#x27;m a redhead. She and I have very different hair types as well. We don&#x27;t live together, have different diets. etc. Wen is what we had in common. I lost about 1/3 the thickness of my hair; I was devastated. I was left with this halo-like effect around my head from the short strands of hair left behind from the rest of my hair breaking off. I quit using it and though my hair stopped falling out, my hair is not the same. Ever after 8 months after not using Wen my hair was not as vibrant and strong as it used to be. After using hair vitamins and some oil treatments, I&#x27;ve got my shine back, but my hair is still not as strong as it used to be. When I part my hair, I still have the halo affect of short strands of hair sticking up and they&#x27;re not new hair, it&#x27;s hair that&#x27;s still breaking off. I used to be able to floss with my hair - no joke! Now, it snaps at the lightest pull. Tons of flyaways, even though I used to have very smooth hair. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did. I don&#x27;t know how the effects could last so long, but they have. I&#x27;ve gotten blood tests to rule out thyroid and hormone problems, and I am healthy, not pregnant, etc. It&#x27;s too much of a coincidence and I have seen from other customer reviews on the web that this same thing has happened to other people.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser!  Nourishes my hair and makes it shiny and silky!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair and as soon I got home, I wanted to wash out the hairspray. I used this &amp; it didn&#x27;t ruin the color nor was my hair dry. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! It has helped my hair become so much more radiant and silky smooth. I had bleached, dry damaged hair. I don&#x27;t believe wen saved me too much with that but it did help my natural hair that was growing out. now that I have about an inch left of damage, I see how much this product has amplified my natural locks giving it more shine...and dare I say volume at the same time! Immediately my family noticed I was doing something different.&lt;br /&gt;So I didn&#x27;t want to stop!&lt;br /&gt;I do not recomend buying the side products....I like the deeper conditioner but the mist and other crap don&#x27;t work well and I&#x27;ve read bad reviews on all of the other flavors of conditioner, beside the sweet almond mint which make me a little skeptical to try them but please let me know if they&#x27;ve worked out for you!&lt;br /&gt; Although I want to have that real wen experience with no shampoo, my hair gets greasy so fast.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like that they promote that you don&#x27;t wear shampoo with it because not everyone can get away with it! It&#x27;s a bit pricy too, that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars; but over all, great product! Can&#x27;t do anything else but help.</li>
    <li> I have already complained to Amazon about this.  When I go to the hair stylist, the Wen feels tingly and softens my hair.  This does nothing for my hair.  Also, my hairstylist says Wen told her they don&#x27;t sell 32 oz bottles.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance of the conditioner. It cleans my hair and more manageable to work with. I feel my hair is shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Love WEN! It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I wash my hair everyday, I typically use a sulfate free shampoo about one time every two or three weeks to clear up a bit of oil.  Wen eliminates frizzies completely! Terrific product</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, was a gift for a relative, she has long thinning hair. She has used it a few times and said it has given her hair more body. She will only use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I like this large bottle for my shower. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The product is okay. It smoothed out the hair and keep the hair soft after washing and blow dry. However, if you have thin and oily hair, it may not the best fit for you. I feel like I need to wash it everyday because it feels heavy and greasy the next day. The first time I used it, I felt good because my hair used to shed when using the other famous brand. But, after a few times, the same amount of hair comes off from Wen also. Not sure is worth it. I will continue to use it every other time but try a new brand in between.</li>
    <li> This product is a fake. I have used Wen many times in the past and loved it. This product made my hair so dry and tangly that I was unable to get a comb through it. Even after rinsing it out thoroughly, it left my hair with this weird residue. Very unhappy that they would not let me return it!!</li>
    <li> This was a great price on a great product!!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair sticky and disgusting. Unfortunately, I have the big, big bottle and can&#x27;t even use it as occasional conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that has made my 40+ year old hair look young again. My hair is shinier, smoother, and healthier looking. It doesn&#x27;t frizz or crinkle anymore, even when I let it dry naturally. The product label says to use 7-8 pumps per use, but I find this is excessive. I only need 2 pumps each time.</li>
    <li> This makes your hair soft, but that tends to happen when it gets suuuper greasy. Save yourself some money and just take a bottle of Pantene conditioner, slather it all over your head and then wash it out. Pretty much the same thing, but your hair won&#x27;t look as greasy after the Pantene vs. Wen. I really wanted to like this, and I am sad it was so crappy. I feel like I got swindled. Damn you, Wen, and your convincing infomercials featuring beautiful hair man!</li>
    <li> The product is great.  It was delivered in a timely manner and well packed.  However, instead of the one large bottle I got two smaller ones.  This is fine, I just like getting the big ones as I like to use them to refill the smaller ones that I save for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen on and off since I was 17 but now I use it always.  I love the sweet almond mint smell, the one step, how it detangles my thick long hair so easily, and my hair is soft and shiny and beautiful once it air dries.  I will NEVER EVER look back.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair cleanser I have come across.  I have curly hair, so naturally, it is dry.  The cleansing conditioner has made such a difference in the texture and volume of my hair - with less frizz!  Of all of the scents, I prefer the sweet almond mint- it is the least harsh.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner. You must do it for two weeks to get used to the change. If you use it once and hate it, you need to keep using it and give it a chance. Rarely ever do I blow dry my hair now because of how little frizzle I get, as well as, the natural wave I haven&#x27;t seen in my hair since before I colored it. Use Tea Tree if you have dandruff, otherwise this one works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Hate anything by Wen.  This made by hair dry up, break off, and fall out after a month of using it.  I had to get professional protein builder treatments to restore my hair.  Hairstylists are right about this product:  it blocks your hair follicles so that no nutrients reach the entire strands of your hair.  And, because we don&#x27;t use shampoo to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; this stuff out, we get a build up.  Then, you begin to have no hair.  Will never use again!</li>
    <li> I saw the commercial on TV for this product. It does exactly what you see. I used it once and will never go back to shampoo again. My hair is soft, shiny, and healthy looking. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I was so stupid to order this online after watching the infomercial. I should have known better. Aside from the fact that the product is not good, it actually dried my hair.  This is the most shadey business with all of their misleading and underhanded practice. You can&#x27;t speak to someone who speaks English and this I guess is how they scam you into ordering far more than you want. If I could have given no stars I would have but I had to give one. Please do not be scammed by this company?</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Use 10-16 pumps for short hair, 16-24 for medium length hair and 24-32 pumps for long hair. If your hair is longer/thicker you may need to increase the amount of pumps.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product and using 24-32 PUMPS the bottle lasted me less than 10 &amp;#34;shampoos&amp;#34;.  Considering that I &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my hair every day or every other day I&#x27;m going to go broke!  I work out everyday and if I get really sweaty during practice I&#x27;m going to wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use less even though my hair is long because it&#x27;s very fine.  But still, for the price what the heck is in this stuff?</li>
    <li> I will never go back to regular shampoo</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the WEN Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner. My hair is fine and I have a natural wave to it. I use about 15 pumps for just above shoulder length hair and leave it in while I finish my shower. Before drying my hair, I use the WEN Sweet Almond Mint styling creme on the ends of my hair. I live in a very humid climate and the WEN cleansing conditioner stops the frizz and give my hair body. I would recommend this product to anyone with fine hair that frizzes easily. The reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is I still feel the need to use a regular shampoo about every 4th or 5th time I wash my hair, so it doesn&#x27;t go limp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not to sure this is the same product I ordered before.  Either the company has changed it formula or this doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Oh well,  its still an acceptable shampoo/conditioner but you&#x27;d be just as okay with a local drug store version.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! I first bought it for my daughter who has naturally curly, coarse and frizzy hair. It took awhile to learn how to use correctly, make sure you pump enough and push through roots well, also get hair wet after and let sit awhile. However, I can get a brush through my daughters&#x27; hair with No Trouble! For my medium thick hair, it makes it so shiny and soft. Will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is was my second purchase of Wen Cleansing Conditioner. I made the switch to Wen 2+ months ago and I&#x27;m sold.  I have a lot of fine wavy hair.  Regular products weigh my hair down and I&#x27;m prone to frizz.  My first purchase was the starter kit; instructions, a few styling aids and a shower comb.  For my routine I use Wen Cleansing Conditioner ever-other day and supplement with regular old conditioner on the off days.  I use the hair dryer, even though Wen promotes letting it air dry. With Wen my hair is healthier, more manageable and more consistent.  There&#x27;s less frizz, I can run my fingers through my hair and it feels great.  Since starting Wen I&#x27;ve quit using hair spray, regular shampoo, an arsenal of styling products.  I spend less money and the Wen routine is simple.  For travel I only need my Cleansing Conditioner (kept the smaller pump bottle from the starter kit) and a comb.  Making the switch will take some getting used to, but stick with it - it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> i have been using this cleaner on my hair for two years. it is amazing stuff. my hair is so healthy and silky smooth and i color it ever three weeks. this stuff is worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this product from the infomercials!!&lt;br /&gt;Their high-pressure phone sales tactics are horrible and I was charged for $210 of extra product that I DID NOT ORDER.&lt;br /&gt;That being said..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I disliked about the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terribly expensive. I&#x27;ve had better results from a store-bought conditioner costing $4 (Tressemme moisture rich conditioner)[[ASIN:B0024NPAAQ TRESemme Shampoo and Conditioner for Dry or Damaged Hair 2/44 oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair and this made me very frizzy. It did not work well at all as a leave-in conditioner after showering. I tried for 2-3 months to find the right combination of products (cleansing conditioner, styling cream, texture balm, etc.) but in the end I went back to Infusium 23 [[ASIN:B0019RKS5K Infusium 23 (Frizz)ologie Leave-In Treatment, Step 3, 16 oz.]] and a bit of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The estimate of a \\&quot;30 day supply\\&quot; is a joke. I would wash my hair about every other day and it still lasted less than half the time. My hair is very thin and did not even need the recommended amount of pumps they specify in the booklet but I was though a 16oz bottle in under 14 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after rinsing, my curly hair would tangle more did not feel as soft and supple as when I used a regular conditioner. It just didn&#x27;t leave that conditioned &#x27;feel&#x27; that I love for my hair to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles did not travel well and made a large mess in my bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I enjoyed about the product:&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is pleasant and there is a large variety to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;I only needed to use a single product in the shower, not a shampoo + conditioner so it was somewhat convenient.&lt;br /&gt;One of the bottles had a bit of a &#x27;tingle&#x27; on my scalp, but not this larger size. You&#x27;d think it would be the same formula...</li>
    <li> Please check your price.I found it cheaper q v c else where.This is a good product but you can get it for less expensive.So look for it to cost less at another place</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen products for several months now and have never had a better shampoo/conditioner.  My hair looks fantastic and has new life.  I will never use regular shampoo again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen since 2008, will never use anything again...Amazon has the best prices!</li>
    <li> I had been using a similar product, but it left my hair feeling dry.  My first use of Wen was WONDERFUL!  It was creamy and it didn&#x27;t take a lot of pumps to do my long, thick hair.  I&#x27;m really pleased with Wen so far and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use anything else.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Wen products and have been using them for years! However, when I received this bottle I immediately notices that it looked different than what I was used to - different consistency (runnier) and slightly different smell. However, I thought maybe it had to do with something that happened during shipping and proceeded to use it. Within two uses my hair got horrible! I told this to a friend who also uses Wen, but gets it directly from the company, so he gave me one of his bottles, I used it and my hair went back to its healthy normal. I wanted to return it, but unfortunately I&#x27;m outside the window to do so (because I didn&#x27;t start using it until recently)</li>
    <li> Although this is a fantastic smelling cleanser, it totally stripped the color from my hair...  I&#x27;ve been processing my hair from black, up to a cool blonde and over the last few months I have seen a colorist 5 times and spent over $1000. I was blaming inept colorists for their inability to get the red/golden/brass out of my hair, so I kept going in and trying to go lighter. I recently went to another high end salon and we were able to achieve the perfect color...bright, cool/butter blonde.  A few days later when I did a full cleans in the shower, boom, blonde is gone and golden brass in it&#x27;s place.  It never occurred to me it could be the WEN during all my coloring attempts because it does say on WEN website &amp;#34;It&#x27;s designed not to strip your hair and scalp of natural oils,leaving your hair with more strength, moisture, manageability and better color retention.&amp;#34;, but that was not my experience.  I&#x27;m hoping my husband has better luck with it, since he gets to use it now as it&#x27;s too expensive to toss...</li>
    <li> I saw Wen ad on tv and just had to try it.  Two months prior I went to the beauty salon for a spiral perm and the hair dresser fried my hair.  I bought everything to try to fix the damage but nothing worked and I was at my witts end.  I ordered the Sweet Almond Mint and after the first time I just cried and cried I was so happy.  I had found my hair miracle.  I have since bought the pomegranite, pumpkin, lavendar and coconut, but the Almond mint is my favorite.  It&#x27;s everything you need.  Shampoo, conditioner, leave in or deep conditioner, my husband asked me why is there only one bottle of shampoo in the shower and I told him it&#x27;s everything in one bottle, that alone makes him happy.  There isn&#x27;t 4 different bottles in the shower anymore.  The decision is simple.  IT&#x27;s wen.............forever.  Buying it on amazon saves alot of money.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE WEN !!!!!!!!!!! if your hair is dry, damaged OR you just want to treat it with TLC ... ditch your damaging shampoo and try WEN. you will love it. i tried it bc of coworkers who swear by it and .. never went back to shampoo! helps me keep my hair healthy and grow it long.</li>
    <li> Never feels like my hair has been shampooed after using this product.  Its more like washing your hair with conditioner.  Also the recommended amount to use and the length of time to leave it on massaging is time consuming.  Hair felt no different after its us.</li>
    <li> I bought an introductory kit about a year ago and tried it all at once.  However, something broke out my face very badly so I mistakenly blamed the basic cleansing conditioner.  I was cleaning out the cabinet and almost threw it away, but decided to give it another chance.  Just the cleanser this time.  My hair is very long and straight.  Wen makes it feel light and soft.  The highlights are amazing.  It&#x27;s like an anti-aging treatment for hair.  At 55, I color monthly, which is very hard on long hair.  But Wen holds my color longer.  I just toss the conditioner that comes with the hair color because Wen is so very healing for my hair!  Yes, you have to follow the directions:  use a lot, rinse a lot.  Try it - it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Have been using Wen for 2 years and got my daughter to try it. We both love it and tell everyone about it</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product that can be used daily and does not dry out your hair. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> My hair responded great with the first bottle, then it dried my hair with continued use. So I have stopped for a while.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to try this but I thought it was too expensive so I tried a sample from a friend and fell in love. The sweet almond mint is wonderful and the smell is fantastic.  I would give it 5 stars if the price woild come down.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful for my fine and thin hair!  I have tried everything on the market and this is the one I will always use from now on!  It has been great for my hair!</li>
    <li> good product, which we could get a better deal.</li>
    <li> What can I say! I&#x27;m a Wen girl. Hair just isn&#x27;t right without it.</li>
    <li> I saw the commercials, and this seemed really awesome, I&#x27;ve tried to look everywhere for a decent shampoo that works for my thin dry hair, so I ordered this, it seemed to work really well at first, but you do need about 16 pumps per shower, so the bottle runs out fast, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than other shampoos I&#x27;ve boughten. I suggest using olive oil shampoo, or tea tree, they work much better, I was really excited for this, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> Just used it for the first time after having a hard time finding the loreal brand cleansing conditioner. I like wen better and it is actually cheaper if you compare ounce to ounce. Also the pump on the loreal doesn&#x27;t work very well and the wen pump is great. One comment I have is that the directions here on Amazon say 10-16 pumps??? Seriously you need like one pump for medium length hair, so that must be a mistake.</li>
    <li> Horrible. This product is under a class action suit. Caused hair loss and breakage. Had to cut my long hair!!&lt;br /&gt;I have to rate this product in order to post this review. I give it no rating! N</li>
    <li> Did not like anything about how this product felt in my hair.</li>
    <li> I had a friend with long thick hair recommend this product to me, and I was a little hesitant. I have thin but very curly hair. I first tried the Almond Mint Cleanser and fell in love. I&#x27;ve recently tried the fig and have seen different (not as great results). I sometimes go back to my regular shampoo just to keep from overusing the product, but I really do like it. My hair was softer and I could actually run my fingers through it. And those with curly hair know that that may be a challenge. I haven&#x27;t tried the other cleansers but definitely recommend the almond mint!</li>
    <li> I Love Wen Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner.  I have natural curly, coarse, thick hair.  This shampoo is&lt;br /&gt;the only thing that has ever made my hair manageable.  Normally, I do not spend this amount of money&lt;br /&gt;on something for myself, but it does last a long time and it is well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> Motivation for Ordering:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After viewing the infomercial for some years, I decided to order the Wen Sweet Almond Mint hair care kit. I wanted a product that was gentle on my multi-racial fine and soft hair (African American/European American).  My down my back medium length hair is so soft that it will not hold a curl, and nor will it hold an up do without tons of hair spray and lots of hair pins--see photo.  The kit contained all the products pictured here: Sweet Almond Mint Conditioner (12 oz.), Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment (2 oz.), Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cream (2 oz.), Sweet Mint Texture Balm (.35 oz.), and a black wide-tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product for two months and my hair color changed from a soft dark brown to a brassy auburn, so I thought.  The texture of my hair changed from soft and smooth to a wooly, brittle, frizzy, and wiry texture.  I went to my stylist to see what we could do to change my hair texture and color back to its original glamorous condition.  She stated, &amp;#34;Your hair is fried, we will have to cut it all off, what have you been using!&amp;#34; I told her that I had ordered Wen because I watched the TV commercials, and it implied that Wen was much more gentle than regular shampoo.  The lovely head of gorgeous hair in the photo is all gone.  My stylist had to cut my hair to within an inch of my scalp.  It is gradually growing back with the aid of vitamins and my regular hair care products. Friends, family members, and persons at my house of faith were astonished at the transformation.  I told them of my experience with Wen.  The proof is in the post pictures, that I am not bold enough to share online, and the astonished looks on their faces. I&#x27;ve heard whispers, &amp;#34;What happened to her hair!&amp;#34;  No, I&#x27;m not taking chemo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Mailings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you order Wen, there are two boxes you can check to opt out of receiving additional mailings of the product, and the other allows them to release your info to third parties.  I selected no for both boxes.  Wen put me on the list anyway even though I had opted out of receiving additional products.  When I called, I spoke to someone in Asia (India) they said that they didn&#x27;t want me to run out. &amp;#34;I told them I checked the no box.  They then proceeded to ask why I wanted to cancel, and I told them that the color and texture of my hair changed and my stylist had to cut away the damaged hair.  They said, &amp;#34;We have a product especially for ethnic hair.&amp;#34;  I declined.  However, I had to pay the $10.40/per box shipping charges and waste my gas to travel to and from the post office to return the mailings I didn&#x27;t order.  The post office does not accept &#x27;return to sender&#x27; for the Wen products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t do enough research before ordering this product.  I should have read all the reviews prior to ordering this product.  My hair was my thing and now it&#x27;s all gone.  Who knows how long it will take to recover.</li>
    <li> This product has taken 10 years off my hair.  It is necessary to wash with a normal shampoo every 10 days or so or your hair will start to get limp.  This is only for people who wash their hair everyday.  Otherwise your hair won&#x27;t feel clean.  I have baby fine hair but after 4 consecutive days of use my hair is very full &amp; shiny.</li>
    <li> I tried my g/f&#x27;s Wen Fig and loved it,(except for the smell) so i ordered Sweet Almond Mint, for my hair type, nothing Sweet Almond about it, just over powering Mint Smell, really disappointed, gives me headaches when using it, minty smell way to strong for me. I do like what the Wen product does for my hair, will order Wen Fig next time.</li>
    <li> try iy your sure to like it.</li>
    <li> Sent as promised, containers what was promised. Have used this as my ONLY hair product for 8 years. Do not use but have tried other Wen products. Use this as shampoo, leave in conditioner, can use a dollop with water to &#x27;freshen&#x27; up.</li>
    <li> If I could give it a zero, I would! I was hooked by the infomercial and thought it would be great. Wrong. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a ripoff of the real product, but what I received and used made my hair disgusting. It was as if I hadn&#x27;t washed it at all. This was a very expensive lesson learned. It was gross.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for a while and love it.  My husband uses it on his beard and it helps keep his whiskers nice and soft.  Personally, I will use a clarifying shampoo after a few weeks to remove any kind of build up.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s necessary, just something I like to do.  But I love how this makes my hair feel.  And I don&#x27;t have to worry about washing my hair more than once a day.  We ride motorcycles.  So there&#x27;s often times where I&#x27;ll wash my hair twice a day.  With the Wen, I don&#x27;t have to worry about over-stripping my hair of natural oils.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This was a good value bottle.  I&#x27;ve used WEN before, and I like it for my thick curly hair that has gotten a bit more course as I&#x27;ve hit menopause.  However, every so often I do have to wash my hair with a regular shampoo to truly clean scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased Wen 6 months ago and I am very grateful that I did.  I am a forty year old female with thin and fine dark blonde hair.  I had numerous  concerns about my hair before using Wen. The greatest concern I had about my hair was actually with my scalp. My scalp was extremely dry and I suffered from dandruff flakes and large scabby patches on my scalp that were painful.  My dermatologist diagnosised it as a type of dermatitis but all of the prescription medications that he prescribed only made it worse.  My hair was also thinning.  My scalp was more noticeable at the site where I part my hair and my hair was falling out at an alarming rate.  My hair was also very dry and flat.  I used to highlight my hair because the color was dull and unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Wen for 6 months and I have witnessed great improvements to my hair.  The most satisfying improvement is to my scalp.  I no longer suffer with dry patches and dandruff flakes.  I can wear dark shirts without embarassement.  My scalp has never been healthier!  I have also stopped having my highlightened.  My dark blonde is actually much shinier and brighter than it has been since I was a child.  Also, I am actually regrowing hair along the part line and throughout.  It is nice to see all of the new growth!  I rarely notice any lost hair in the shower or on my brush.  My hair is stronger and fuller now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still occassionally have bad hair days but it is only because I am too lazy, not because of my hair.  The more I use Wen the better my hair looks.  It is best to use it everyday and 4-5 pumps with each use. I noticed results after the first use with Wen.</li>
    <li> The only things I would wish for more were that Wen wasn&#x27;t so expensive,&lt;br /&gt;and that Wen came in larger sizes than 32oz.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is not giving my hair the same benefits as the sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner directly from the chaz company did. My hair was so smooth and it worked wonderful but this one seems to be drying out my hair. makes me wonder, I think I am going to go back to direct order from chaz.</li>
    <li> The item was well packaged so the plastic bottle did not get punctured. The item arrived before the project arrival date.</li>
    <li> I refuse to live without my Wen, period!</li>
    <li> I have bleached hair and I call it &amp;#34;like dealing with cotton candy&amp;#34; when I wash it. Wen did/does a great job making it easier to comb out the knots when it&#x27;s wet. Highly recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> The product makes my scalp have flakes n itchy. The scalp doesn&#x27;t feel clean. I got the pomegranate and the smell is not pleasant. It is over priced, doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s just the high marketing they use that is convincing. The customer service is horrible. Very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M STILL  GIVING IT A CHANCE IT DOES NOT SEEM TO COMPLETLY CLEAN HAIR AND SEEMS TO LEAVE A FILM</li>
    <li> Love this product! Does what it says and more! Can&#x27;t say enough about Wen products! Try it!!!!</li>
    <li> Please change the design of this pump on this bottle.  This product is way to expensive to be wasting any of it and your pumps DO NOT WORK!  I have broke my last pump on one of these bottles and will not purchase the pump bottles again.</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my hair feels doing and after a cleanse. I color my hair, but if I wash my hair every week, i notice at my 3rd hair cleansing my hair color will start to fade.</li>
    <li> Its a great product. My hair would&#x27;nt grow any longer than 5 to 6 inch cause it was breaking off.&lt;br /&gt;I started using Wen Cleansing Conditioner and in a mouth time my hair was growing. It also fells&lt;br /&gt;so soft. I will not use anything else but Wen products. Try it you we love it.</li>
    <li> My hair is corse &amp; color treated. WEN is the only hair cleansing product I&#x27;ve used that lease my hair shinny &amp; manageable without leaving it limp or weighed down. Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I had great expectations for this product, but it fell far,far short! This may be fine for really problem hair, and then only once a month, because the product, though thoroughly rinsed out,does build up on your hair and weighs it down and dulls it.  It&#x27;s very expensive and not at all worth the money.</li>
    <li> I like the fig much, much better. My hair felt dry and brittle. There was no improvement in hair texture at all.</li>
    <li> I admit, this stuff is expensive, but I like it. My wife let me try hers, and I never stopped using it. My hair feels neither dry, or oily, Just clean, I really like it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great product</li>
    <li> My wife love this product and she recommend it to anyone.  You can order only the product you love without any further obligation.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen Cleansing Conditioner for about THREE years and have never had any problems with it at all.  It cleans my short hair with about TWO PUMPS of the product rather than the 10-15 pumps as recommended on the bottle.  Quite frankly, the only person I can see who would use that much would have to have extremely long, thick hair. Try using less and you&#x27;ll see.  I don&#x27;t use any of the other products that came with it since my first purchase (styling gel, etc.), but today I did purchase the texturizer which I didn&#x27;t know existed until I saw it today on Amazon.  Thought, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll give it a try.\\&quot; I&#x27;ll let you know after I try it how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED (MORE THAN SATISFIED) WITH THIS PRODUCT AND HOPE IT STAYS ON THE MARKET AS I DON&#x27;T EVER WANT TO RETURN TO SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER! This is a one-step solution:  wet your hair, put on a couple or more pumps&#x27; worth of product, leave on 2-3 minutes, rinse out, and you&#x27;ll have a great head of hair to work with. I like the largest size Wen makes as I know I&#x27;ll be using it from now on.  [[ASIN:B001800I44 Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, 32oz]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been loyal to this product for the past three years. Started using it when I was engaged and preparing my hair for my wedding - six months of soley using sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner and my hair went from major bleach and color damaged to glossy, thick, and healthy. These days, I use it twice a week as a deep conditioner mixed with Yes to Cucumber shampoo and conditioner, and my hair feels great.</li>
    <li> My hair is, for the first time, tangle free after washing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and NOTHING else. I will never use anything else again. i have recommended it to all my friends and family. I use hair colour regularly and it saves my colour from fading. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel all dry and frizzy any more.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels when using WEN shampoo. You use a lot of product but the results are amazing.</li>
    <li> was bad, leaves hair greasy</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used, its expensive but well worth it if your hair is in need of nourishment and body</li>
    <li> after using this for 2 weeks...and spending so much for it... I use it like you would a conditioner, my scalp just did not feel clean, so now I shampoo with my favorite shampoo and use this as the conditioner MONEY wasted!</li>
    <li> Love the Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner.  Love the smell.  Love the pump for the bottle. Love that don&#x27;t need shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s both in there.  Makes my hair look amazing.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Smell good, and it seems to do the job (as much as I can ever tell a conditioner is doing anything to my hair).</li>
    <li> Wen has completely changed my hair. It&#x27;s repaired it with in a few washes made it look really full and healthy. I will absolutely buy more</li>
    <li> I am not sure if Wen is for  all types of hair, but I have very dry, frizzy, over the top ugly hair.  The Wen system is simply amazing for my  kind of hair.  I will use it from here on out due to the fact that I have never had the control with any product that I have with Wen.</li>
    <li> I started using wen in late 2012.  For the first few months my hair improved but I have since noticed different affects that I should share.  With wen, my hair felt and looked softer and shinier without being oily-shiny, seemed to retain moisture longer and feel cleaner longer than before, seemed to hold bounce longer and not feel as flat and weighted by the end of the day as before, and felt like it was becoming stronger or more flexible so as to not break under slight pressure.  During the day it felt great running my fingers through my hair and feeling it smoothly slide back into place below my shoulders in a wispy fashion.  Wen made my hair feel refreshed any hour of the day.  I had been using pantene shampoo and conditioner regularly before and I decided to invest in trying wen because with pantene my mid-length, straight, naturally thin hair would become flat, oily and unbearably limp by afternoon on a daily basis.  I had what I would describe as average (not above average) daily hair loss due to daily shampooing of mid-length hair.  Before using wen, there would be some hairs caught on top of the shower drain which I would remove daily after a shower.  For a time being after wen I believed I was losing less hair down the drain, although I could see hair strands being loosened by wen along with the detangling benefits of distributing wen throughout the hair.  Because I was sold after several month&#x27;s use--the transformation was wonderful and worth even the price--I told myself this was part of the transformation process and I focused on the detangling benefits and how great my hair felt and looked and I would have continued paying for wen.  Then, maybe 6+ months later I noticed the shower drain started to clog to the point where water was trapped a couple of inches above floor level and the amount of draining time after showering steadily increased.  The shower would drain so it was not an immediate plumbing concern but it would take longer to drain, not to mention that the water level got to the point where I could kick and swoosh water around my shower floor while I showered.  When I finally got around to unscrewing the drain cover, I used one of those flexible pipe grabbers and pulled out what appeared to be a chunk of long hair meshed together in the ironic shape of a pony tail as if all that drained hair had somehow collected itself in a natural flowing bundle not quite able to be pushed out by water beyond the drain catch points yet--and it was definitely my hair.  The amount of hair in that mesh looked about the same amount of hair left on my head if I was to pull my hair into a pony tail.  I am not kidding.  I was a little shocked, scared, and uncertain of what could have caused this.  My shower drain has never clogged like this before.  For a good moment I questioned whether wen contributed to this, but I really didn&#x27;t want to believe because I really loved wen and what I felt it was doing for my hair but also because I didn&#x27;t have a smoking gun and didn&#x27;t want to jump to conclusions.  One reason I told myself was that maybe wen didn&#x27;t make my hair fall out more than any other shampoo but that maybe it just made the hairs flow pass the drain more and because of this, I wasn&#x27;t able to pick up hair after each shower like before.  So I continued using wen up until early 2014.  I really was enchanted by how it made my hair feel and to this day I probably would have continued using wen except that in early 2014, although the clogged drain hasn&#x27;t occurred again, I checked the drain pipe out of curiosity and happened to pull out a similar meshed hair pile that this time appeared to have about 1/3 equal of the amount of hair left on my head.  I look back and wondered if my increasingly wispy hair feeling was due to the issue that my hair was becoming less full. Note I did not lose hair in patches, it was just thinning to the point where my pony tail was starting to look like a man&#x27;s pony tail. For sometime during the later months of wen use I did feel my hair was looking sadly thinner (I had this feeling before becoming aware of any other reviewers&#x27; potential hair loss--I thought it was in my head). This observation coupled with recent searches for connections to possible hair loss has informed my personal decision to stop using wen.  I am a real customer, not with any other motive than to share my experience.  I can&#x27;t say I know that wen contributed or was the sole or partial contributor or that you should not try wen yourself but what I do want to say is that if you experience hair loss, trust your gut instinct and beware of going down that denial road--the road that you want this miracle to continue working so badly.  Look for alternatives or simply take a break from wen for a while. You can always go back to using wen with the click of an order button but you will take longer to regrow hair regardless of the primary source of hair loss.  I decided I would rather have naturally thin flat oily bad hair days than thinning beautiful feeling hair days and this is certainly not a happy ending for me--not that wen is to blame but maybe I too just need a break. Best wishes.</li>
    <li> Love this product..it&#x27;s done amazing things for my hair.</li>
    <li> Ever since I went through menopause, I have tried countless shampoos and conditioners to find one that leaves my hair soft and shiny with no success until  now. The Wen product leaves my hair soft, shiny and smelling great. My hair had become dry and brittle and bore no resemblance to the hair of my youth. The Wen product brought my thick wavy hair back to its original condition. Thank you Wen!</li>
    <li> Had to stop using it because it was breaking my hair. At first my hair looked good and felt soft. I liked the smell and the concept. But there is too much protein in it for my hair, that is what made my hair dry and then break off. I have long hair and it was breaking at half strand. The protein is promoted as if everyone needs it. They never mention that some people don&#x27;t need that much and it can ruin your hair. A good hair stylist would know that too much can damage your hair. Any stylist should know. Show the ingredients to your hair stylist before purchasing.</li>
    <li> I am a brunette with coarse hair cut in a bob.  I do color my hair.  I have always had coarse hair which is both a blessing and a curse.  Don&#x27;t expect WEN to change naturally coarse hair into silky smooth hair, it doesn&#x27;t.  What it does do is make my hair softer.  As well as cleansing my hair with it, I use an extra squirt as a styling cream.  It styles perfectly.  Other benefits I have noticed while using WEN are; I use whats left on my hands as a body lotion, my color stays less brassy in between coloring appointments, I use my staightening iron less, it smells wonderful.  I cleans my hair every other day and I have no problem with it looking or feeling greasy with WEN ( no more than I did with regular shampoos and conditioners).  Will I ever go back to regular shampoos and conditioners?  Only if I run out of WEN and I haven&#x27;t ordered a new bottle in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen now for a couple of years.  It has actually eliminated my split ends completely, which I never dreamed was possible.  I always thought my brushing was the cause of my split ends.  I never considered it was all the sulfites in normal shampoo.  It was great the first time I used it and I liked it as it eliminated my need to use two products, shampoo and then conditioner.  That was a real time saver, so I was sold on it and began using it exclusively.  I love the scent of the mint and enjoyed the way my hair responded to the product.  Shiny but not oily, manageable, easy to style and best of all, it cut down on my frizzies.  After about a year or so of continuous use, it suddenly hit me that I wasn&#x27;t needing haircuts nearly as often as I simply had almost no split ends.  My hair was able to grow out longer, which was nice as I had hit a point where cutting off split ends meant I never got any more length.  That was the cherry on top for me.  I won&#x27;t use anything else anytime soon.  I do use a clarifying shampoo maybe once every 2-3 months just to get a real clean slate but that is just my preference.  I have tried their other scents, but this remains my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;My hair did not come out as well using the lavender, or the pomegranate scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price here is too high though.  I use the auto-ship from Gunthy Renker which was pretty scary at first as I have heard all the horror stories of when you order through those types of companies.  So far I have had no problems with them.  They stop shipping any time I ask them to which I have done a few times as I was getting it faster than I was using it and it was starting to really stack up on me.  They have given me a good price as a regular purchaser.  We did buy this bottle here as the size is nicer than the 16 oz bottle, and I use the small ones to fill this big one and we use this one in the shower.  Unfortunately the smaller bottles never pump out the last inch of product and I am always having to unscrew it, turn it upside down and whack the heck out of it.  I wish they would change the pump to a longer stemmed one to get the last of the product out with the pump.  Very frustrating.  Wen, if you are paying attention, please get the pump issue fixed!  And if the price here would come down I would be getting these bigger bottles all the time from Amazon!</li>
    <li> First of all there are several places you can buy wen from. I recommend Amazon.com or QVC. QVC is a direct distributor of WEN and offers special sales a few times a year on this product which makes it more affordable. I absolutely love this stuff. I use it in an unconventional way. I do a \\&quot;quickie\\&quot; wash with a sulfate free shampoo  ( like organix ) and use this as a second cleanse and condition. This way I can use less product and make it last longer and I have PERFECT hair. Sweet Almond mint smells like a York peppermint patty! yummy!  As for the hair loss stories you hear that is rare. This product has menthol and some people are alergic to it otherwise menthol promotes hair growth and regrowth! Some formulas are wheat based, pomograniate and the seasonals are soy based and the new WEN kids is rice based with no menthol so there is a formula for everyone to address all sensitivities</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s: Love the smell&lt;br /&gt;  Works for me&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: Cost is ridiculous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution is to dilute it. I saved the empty bottle from my initial purchase and poured half of my second bottle into it. Then I filled them both to the top with water and shook them really hard.  The result is that it&#x27;s easier to pump, easier to distribute into my hair, easier to rinse and obviously I&#x27;m using less so I&#x27;m saving money - 50% which is pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how it might not work for someone with very thick hair, but if you already have some try diluting it and see if that helps.</li>
    <li> My hair is the best that it&#x27;s ever been,and I color my hair.</li>
    <li> We are DELIGHTED with the Wen 32 oz Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner!  We started with the regular 16 oz, but needed something larger - which also cost us less than getting two 16 oz.  The larger one can be used as is with the larger pump that comes with it, or you can use the larger sized bottle to fill the your other bottles! :0)</li>
    <li> This product works well</li>
    <li> My favorite for years no longer have to buy shampoo &amp; conditioner one product my hair has never looked better.  And my hair is considered fine or thin.</li>
    <li> Love , Love Love! I already loved the product  but this is my first time buying the larger bottle. I keep it right beside the sink.</li>
    <li> Only product I buy for cleansing my hair</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it is the only thing I use on my hair. My color looks great between salon visits (and that not easy with red) and my hair always feels great.</li>
    <li> After initially using wen I was pleased, it was only after a month I started to notice some small hair loss. It eventually got worse resulting in bald spots. The only change to my normal hair care routine was using the wen products. I have found many similar complaints so be careful when trying this product. I had long brown beautiful hair now I am disgusted embarrassed every time I see my hair piling up in the shower drain.</li>
    <li> Beware  This made my hair fall out use at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Not likely to purchase again.  Recommend you clean your hair with alternative shampoo and use this as conditioner only</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! We received the actual WEN, not the Guthy-Renker knockoff which is not the same as the good ole original.</li>
    <li> If you have curly kinky dry brittle loss of lust in your type of hair, this hair product will reestablish and restore as well rejuvenate those frizzy out of control tangled brillo like type of hair.</li>
    <li> I saw the infomercial so many times that when I had the chance to purchase the product at a silent auction, I did so.  I got two 16 oz bottles of the almond mint along with some other products. I have super thick, bone straight, color treated hair that is down my back (right above my butt) and it was always looking a bit drab...until I started using Wen.  Now I do have to use a lot of product...considering the length of my hair, but I am now at the point where I truly only \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my hair once or twice a week and it never gets that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; look...just has a nice shine.  I used to never wear my hair down but after I started using Wen, I wanted to show off how good it looked!! Plus--my color stays in super long...it doesn&#x27;t get washed out like it used to with shampoo.  I love the product and have decided to order more -- I am trying a different scent, so I hope I get the same results.</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves my hair soft, shiny (Not greasy), &amp; pretty. I love this particular conditioner because, while you lather, you get a lovely aroma of the minty almond smell, and then your scalp will start to tingle (in a good way) like someone opened up all your hair folicals and let them BREATHE! Leaving it in your hair for 2-3 minutes lets the tingle seep in and get down deep, making your hair feel healthy. Once you rinse it out, the tingle doesn&#x27;t go away, it actually stays until your hair is dry. While your hair is drying, you feel like air is getting to your scalp more then ever and your hair feels light. It&#x27;s an amazing expeirience, i love this product. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love the Wen haircare products! I was a little hesitant about ordering this as I wasn&#x27;t sure it was a knock off or whatever but it works just as well as the Wen products I have received from the Wen website. I absolutely love this product and wholeheartedly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This Wen smells amazing and does a great job of cleansing my hair. I like the original lavender Wen, but really prefer the almond scent. It does a great job, and you don&#x27;t need to use nearly as much as they recommend.</li>
    <li> The brand, the smell, my expectations on delivery was all great! I started using this cleaning conditioner about 2-3 months ago and I just totally loved it. My hair is thick, wavy, and very unruly. But not anymore! It is much more manageable. My co-workers said my hair looks shiny, soft, and smells wonderful. I have them hooked as well as my sister-in-law.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this product I haven&#x27;t put any other product in my hair.  My hair is thick so I would occasionally apply a relaxer, since day one of using Wen, I&#x27;ve stopped using relaxers!  I only need to blow dry and flat iron and my hair is amazingly straight and manageable.  I constantly, (almost daily), receive compliments on my hair.  I LOVE my hair since I&#x27;ve started using Wen.  THANK YOU for such an amazing product.  I hope they come out with a line of heat styling products, (i.e.  flat iron protectant, etc..).  I don&#x27;t currently like the styling cream.</li>
    <li> This is not Wen! I contacted Wen after using this product and didn&#x27;t have the same results as my previous Wen shampoo. They stated to me they do not make a product in this size and the label is different but similar to theirs. I am now trying to get a refund for the 2 bottles I bought!!! Beware!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for over a year. I have very long, thick, straight hair and my hair has never looked better.  Yes, I do have to use a lot-  22 pumps from the 32oz size, but I only need to wash my hair 3 times a week.  It makes combing easier and between cleansing, less hair falls out when brushing.  It is expensive, but I think it is totally worth it;  I am also not having to use a leave-in conditioner or anti-frizz cream or gloss to keep my hair smooth.  The trick is to use what is recommended- if you use less product, you won&#x27;t get the correct result and your hair will look greasy.</li>
    <li> good shampoo conditioner in one.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff took me awhile to get used to  it since unlike other shampoos it doesnt foam up. But after every use it makes your hair feel super soft. Perfect for dry or damaged hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and makes my hair feel soft in a way that no other conditioner or hot oil ever has.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already written a review on the 16oz Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner. It&#x27;s changed my life. I use only Wen, and have been for almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is for the 32 oz size. I highly recommend lovers of Wen go with this size, especially if you have thick hair or long hair. I refill my other bottles when traveling, and I don&#x27;t have to reorder so often. As I said, I&#x27;ve been working with Wen for a year, even tried the Lavendar, the Cucumber, etc, etc... and landed on this, the 32 oz Sweet Almond Mint. It&#x27;s been more than a year and I&#x27;m still sold on it.</li>
    <li> I tried just the conditioner and really liked it. I am wanting to try the other products that go with it.  I ordered 3 other sets for Christmas gifts. In ordering I placed the order in early December and it stated allow 4 -7 business days for shipping. We have had our Christmas and still NO Wen Products! I am disappointed. And the only information I get on the web site was it is on back order and now it states status: to be confirmed.&lt;br /&gt;They should quit advertising so much and get the products made and shipped to the orders they have received.&lt;br /&gt;One thing about the conditioner, I find you should use your regular shampoo every other time or third time. To me this helped keep my hair from being too soft and makes it easier to hold curls.&lt;br /&gt;It will be interesting to see if this product line lasts in the long run.</li>
    <li> I know so many people that use WEN and love it.  I have long, naturally curly finer hair, and lots of it. I have tried the Almond Mint, the Lavendar and the Fig.  I did everything as directed (both in written directions and from the infomercials), but after 6 months, I wasn&#x27;t happy with how my hair was feeling or looking.  WEN seemed to weigh down my hair and make it dull in appearance.  I was also going through a noticeable hair loss when using WEN, but not sure if it was WEN or something else.  I stopped using WEN, and started using Pureology.  My hair picked back up in shine and had more volume again.  I continued to lose hair for about another month after stopping the WEN, so again, I&#x27;m not sure if it was WEN related or not.</li>
    <li> Makes my fine hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Great price as always a Wen girl!</li>
    <li> love it well buy again</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love my Wen Products</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much all I use.  Love It.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased from this seller before. Always great!!!</li>
    <li> Ok ladies I know that I am not Chaz&#x27; usual consumer.  I use this product on my beard and I have tried them all, this is the best, it keeps a large beard under control, moist and fragrant.  I have no hair on my head, but love my beard when I use Wen.</li>
    <li> Great hair care product for great price does wonder for your hair.</li>
    <li> expensive but a great product.</li>
    <li> Simply the best product for my hair! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wen products are great. My hair feels soft and shining. People ask me what I use and I tell them Wen.</li>
    <li> My hair always turns out greasy after i wash my hair with Wen.</li>
    <li> I have type 4b hair at in moisturized my curls. After I wash it. I put just a little more as a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and Wen is best for hair.  No longer is my fine hair limp and oily looking.  Love the fluff and flow.  No need to use extra products on hair.  Just a small dollop of wen as a leave in conditioner and hair can air dry or blow dry without the frizz.  Thanks seller..I do recommend you highly..A+ to you.</li>
    <li> Love it!! From the first wash you can feel your hair get healthier and stronger - only gets better from there!</li>
    <li> I love this product, but I feel it is too expensive. Also, it would be nice to just go out and purchase it when I need it, rather than having to order it and wait for it. I have tried some of the other products that claim to be just like Wen, but I haven&#x27;t found one that I like nearly as much.</li>
    <li> WEN products are great for women with natural hair!!!  I have seen the difference in the health of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair. This is the only product that keeps it from becoming frizzy. I only wish I had found it sooner.</li>
    <li> Fast &amp; smooth delivery. On the expensive side. it does work good but not great.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very expensive, but it does make my hair soft &amp; silky.  I have naturally curly hair so it doesn&#x27;t look like the girls on tv that have long flowing straight hair.  Someone (a hairdresser) told me to stop using it immediatly because it has some bad chemicals in it, BUT I asked a&lt;br /&gt;very good Dr. if he thought it was harmful and he stated no worse than anything else your put on your head (shampoos, colors, etc).  So I am&lt;br /&gt;still using it because my hair feels silky.  I wish the price would come down some, that&#x27;s the only negative thing I can say about this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good stuff. I&#x27;m glad they didn&#x27;t send me the Guthy Renker version because I was looking specifically for the chazdean.com version</li>
    <li> One of the best  cleansing conditions on the market.  Nice that you don&#x27;t need other products (conditioner) which saves some money.  It is, however, a pricey item and not one we can get as often as we&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> This product works great on tight curly hair. I&#x27;ve always struggled with finding products that work with my hair but with this one I have had great success.</li>
    <li> the BEST hair care product on the market. I have long color treated hair and this cleansing conditioner has saved my hair. I also use this on my dogs and they feel amazing.</li>
    <li> For most of us, life feels like a movie we&#x27;ve arrived at forty-five minutes late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something important seems to be going on . . . maybe. I mean, good things do happen, sometimes beautiful things. You meet someone, fall in love. You find that work that is yours alone to fulfill. But tragic things happen too. You fall out of love, or perhaps the other person falls out of love with you. Work begins to feel like a punishment. Everything starts to feel like an endless routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life happens. But. It does not happen to you!&lt;br /&gt;You happen to it!&lt;br /&gt;We r not victims !&lt;br /&gt;For everything that happens in life there is a decision I can make that will make the outcome manageable. Poor decisions: sad consequences. Good decisions : Happy Consequences.&lt;br /&gt;;~PB</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the bomb.its amazing how well it cleans your hair and leaves it silky smoothe and very manageable. I&#x27;d buy this product again and again. I can&#x27;t get enough of it. Buy it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great customer service. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> I bought the almond mint cleansing conditioner  32 oz  for $ 58.  It&#x27;s a big bottle and the pump is NOT working !!!&lt;br /&gt;That makes it pretty hard to use whithout a pump :(</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works wonders on your hair.  Miracle product actually.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this product which caused me hair loss, at first my hair seemed greasy at the scalp and dry and brittle at the tips so I called up and they told me it takes about a month for my hair to get used to it so I kept using it.  about a month in I noticed chunks of inch long hair sticking out of my hairline and scalp which made me look weird like i had split ends, it started breaking off and I was finding a TON of hair in my hair brush that was breaking off when I brushed my hair, I am depressed because my hair was gorgeou and now it looks so ratty and unkempt :(&lt;br /&gt;I tried to get a refund but amazon has a  30 day return policy and told me to contact wen, I contacted wen who is supposed to have a 60 day return policy but told me since i did purchase it through amazon they absolutely cannot help me and routed me back to amazon, have been getting the run around for sure &#x3D;/ it was a very expensive product and am so bummed out about my hair loss and that I spend so much money on a product that did not work When you call wen the customer service reps are in a hurry to get you off the phone and repeat the same scripted lines over again about how they can&#x27;t help you.&lt;br /&gt;My hairstylist told me to google Wen Lawsuits and I was shocked, please do research before buying this product. If you buy this through Amazon and don&#x27;t like it Wen will not be able to help you. It seems to work for some people and they love it but that was not the case with me, maybe one of the ingredients just doesn&#x27;t agree with my hair. I hadn&#x27;t done anything differently and do not dye or use heat on my hair so I know that the Wen was causing my hair loss/ hair breakage issues. In the end I am out $60 bucks and my hair is now ruined.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for over a year and I&#x27;ve never had better hair! I get many complements. Have no doubts about ordering it you will love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good stuff. My nearly elbow-length, dyed hair looks lovely. However, I&#x27;m not sure the quality justifies the price. It would be one thing if $70 worth lasted a long time, but I&#x27;ve only been using about it 3 weeks and I&#x27;m halfway through the 32 oz bottle. Also, it really slicks up the bottom of the shower. I&#x27;m going to need to get some floor appliques because I slipped and darn near broke my neck this morning.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted to return this sub-par product which did the complete opposite of what they claimed...aka makes your hair nice and greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling to cancel the remaining shipments through their automated answering service we were told our account was canceled and we wouldn&#x27;t be charged or sent anymore product...Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next month we received another shipment and were billed again :0 So we called and cancelled again using their automated answering service. (SPOILER: their automated answer service obviously doesn&#x27;t work because we got billed again!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to stay on until I spoke with a REAL PERSON (I recommend getting a good book to read while you wait.) and I eventually had the pleasure of speaking with \\&quot;Darius\\&quot; who informed me if I returned the product I would get a refund.  I fedex&#x27;d them back their product and mistakenly assumed I was done with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.  Next we received a collection letter from the wonderful people over at Wen.  Funny, I assumed canceling THREE times would be enough to have them get the hint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling back again and waiting an hour again to speak to a live individual I was finally informed by a \\&quot;supervisor\\&quot; the account would finally be canceled and I would receive my refund. (Never do business with a company that refuses to EMAIL you a confirmation the account is canceled...they would only send it by mail.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know they&#x27;re lying to me like they lied to me the previous three times but I&#x27;m sure at some point the Better Business Bureau will get to the bottom of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story - Useless product, even worse customer service, it&#x27;s basically a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the same mistake we did...don&#x27;t order it in the first place!!!</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t use this product for every shampoo, I do use it about 2/3 of the time as it is much gentler than shampoo, and does get your hair and scalp clean without stripping.  However, you do NOT need to use the really copious amounts of the product that the infomercial directs you to use at each application.  Less works just as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for my curly hair :)</li>
    <li> Have always loved this stuff, just wish it was more affordable so that I can use it everyday.</li>
    <li> returned it to chaz dean at Oxnard ca.  I paid $12.78 tracking #9534611079155055446990 on Feb 24th and did not hear from them.  This product does not do anything for my hair It&#x27;s amazing how they show models with magnificent hair to start off with and they probably could use any shampoo.  This cost me $59.00 wasted dollars.  Very annoyed to waste my money</li>
    <li> Wonderful love the product</li>
    <li> I love the big bottle because I don&#x27;t have to order it as often. I wish Amazon would add it to Subscribe &amp; Save, but until then the big bottle is the best. RE: WEN - I&#x27;ve been a WEN user for 7+ years and I have not looked back. My hair is bleached every 6 months and the WEN almost eliminates any damage from the dye.</li>
    <li> I know some people hate this stuff, but I love it.  I have very fine, straight hair that tends to get very greasy at the roots and dries out at the ends.  I use to have to wash my hair every single day, until I started using this stuff.  I use to make the mistake of using regular shampoo once a week even while using Wen, but once I finally starting using the Wen as directed, it really made my hair so much healthier and shinier.  You have to use a lot of it and comb it through your scalp and hair, then leave it on for at LEAST 2 minutes.  And don&#x27;t ever use any other shampoo or conditioner (you can use Wen on the ends of your hair for a leave in conditioner).  You will get the best results this way.  My mom has had the same experience as me and she has very corse hair that tends to get fuzzy and has natural curl.  When you first use Wen, you won&#x27;t feel like your hair is clean (that squeaky clean scalp feeling is actually very bad for your scalp and hair).  But stick with it and after a few weeks, you&#x27;ll be so happy.  I&#x27;ve converted a lot of my family and friends who are so happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Can&#x27;t  live without it.</li>
    <li> Big bottle is a bit akward.</li>
    <li> it is a really nice product and works really well</li>
    <li> This is wonderful product for dry or damaged hair.</li>
    <li> The first time I used Wen I loved it. It might be alittle pricey but every once in awhile I need to do something for myself.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t sing the praises of Wen sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner.  This product is amazing.  I first learned about it watching a paid promotional TV ad . . . for some reason, I actually bought it because of that ad.  I was scared at first.  I used it the first time when I was getting ready for a black tie affair . . .  My hair, on the first wash, was so healthy, shiny, manageable, clean.  This product does all it says it does and more.  Ive used WEN now for about 3 years.  My hair has never been healthier.  I will never use shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Convenient pump and really enjoyed the larger size Wen conditioner. The service was great~thanks! I will recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I was really happy to find another way to purchase this stuff without having to go directly through WEN.  They can&#x27;t seem to get product to you unless you subscribe or something.  I like being able to order what I want, when I want.</li>
    <li> Love all wen product,makes my hair look beautiful and soft.</li>
    <li> I really like this product- it makes my hair soft and curly - the 32 oz seems to last longer than the 16 oz</li>
    <li> IT LEAVES MY WIFE&#x27;S HAIR SLICKY SMOOTH, TANGLE FREE AND SMELLING GREAT!!  LOVE RUNNING MY FINGERS THREW HER HAIR NOW!!!</li>
    <li> It is the BEST item to clean a person&#x27;s hair, my hair is in the best condition it has ever been.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for almost 2 years now and it makes my hair less frizzy and smooth.  I have thick hair that is colored.  It also helps with my color</li>
    <li> I have short, fine, colored hair.  This is very gentle. I live in Florida and exercise a lot, so I need to wash my hair a lot and this is easier on the color than most shampoos.  I only use about 3-4 pumps, not the 16 that I had read about. You do need some common sense.</li>
    <li> I like this product, does not suds and mysteriously does magic on my head, would recommend everyone to try it</li>
    <li> Wen has totally changed my feelings about myself and my hair.  I now wear my hair long and flowing instead of a short bob to control the frizz and curls.  Wen adds enough weight to my hair to settle it down.  No more frizz!!  My husband, who has fine straight hair, also uses &amp;#34;my Wen&amp;#34;.  Not only does he like the way his hair feels, he swears that Wen cured a longtime rash on his body that even the dermatologists couldn&#x27;t help!!  Whatever, if he&#x27;s happy, then I&#x27;m happy :)  We all know how bad shampoos and soaps are for our skin.  They are very drying, which is the cause of frizzy hair and dry skin that develops into rashes.</li>
