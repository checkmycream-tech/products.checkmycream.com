    <li> Great needles. I would buy this item again. Great price fast service. If you tattoo buy these needles. Great line work.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much. this product was well packaged and i appreciate how it was sealed and sterilized. I have used them and will be one of your return clients.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the product, big waste of money, some needles stick out further than the others, and are not placed close together</li>
    <li> I ORDERED A BOX. I&#x27;VE USED MAYBE 6 SO FAR. THEY DO A GREAT JOB &amp; CAUSE THE CUSTOMER LESS PAIN THAN WITH THE PRICIER NEEDLES I WAS USING BEFORE.</li>
    <li> love it !! thanks!! fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> Shows monster point needles and box but comes in a plain white box and is made in china. These are knock offs.</li>
    <li> thanks for making things right ,your co, did what they said,they,do by getting things right,hell they are good needles and they have stayed sharp,i&#x27;m sorry I insulted the co, because these neddle have been sharper than  m. p.&#x27;s,and fit the tubes better for better ink flow.hell the last batch of monster point the glue come undone, but these  needles have held there on. I learned not to bitch to you give it a try&#x27;the name brand isn&#x27;t always the best ,they were good needles on the long haul ,and I think this co. for being so,nice and generous but they shouldn&#x27;t advertise monster point when they are not, but I bet my ass m.p. are made in china with all the ce brands.  crazy  rick</li>

    <li> Great needles and great price. Buy these and you will not regret it. Smooth lines these are my favorite needles</li>
    <li> These are NOT MonsterPoint needles.. and they are not even close!! There was NO individual sterile dots.. so these can not be used legally in some states (like mine). While they are 7 needle, they are SUPER tight.. they are tighter than my 5 liners!! These would not work for me at all... and I was graciously given a refund.</li>
    <li> These worked very well for me! I dont really&lt;br /&gt;Care for a real thin outline! These create a somewhat bold and very smooth outline! They shipped quick and work perfect!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great price!</li>
    <li> Not what they seem to be advertised as.  Not actually Monster Point.  Come in plain white box that just says \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; on it.  They are super tight bug pin liners which it doesn&#x27;t say.  About the size of a normal 3 liner or tighter.</li>
    <li> I use these needles for just about every tattoo at some point. Really nice liners and lay a nice bold outline.</li>
