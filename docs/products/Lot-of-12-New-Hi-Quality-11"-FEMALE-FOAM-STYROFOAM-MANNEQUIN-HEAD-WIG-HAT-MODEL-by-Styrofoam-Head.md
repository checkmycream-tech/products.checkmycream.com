<li> We are using them to handle the wigs and headpieces in our dramatic production.</li>

    <li> This is not twelve heads.  It is only one.  At least that is what I received. If you only want one head and are will to pay this much for it, you are good to go.</li>
    <li> I liked the product and the fast shipping - some of the noses were a bit smashed, tho, or I would have given this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> i was sent old heads that had dirt on them i used them as experiments as to not waste them. the quality of the heads were sub par</li>
    <li> These high quality Styrofoam heads were packed well and arrived in perfect condition, on time, and with no dents. They are very good quality, with minimal seam and mold lines.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Using these to display hats I made for sale.  Work great for my use and I felt like I got a great deal.</li>
    <li> These are good heads. The size is quite nice.  We are using them to handle the wigs and headpieces in our dramatic production. Service was excellent.  Came on schedule.</li>
    <li> We use these to display mask collections, and also to build props for halloween and other events.  Not for wigs.</li>
    <li> We bought these for a granddaughter who cosplays and has a growing wig collection.  On Christmas she.used one of them as a prop ... Quite funny :). They are lightweight, but serve their purpose quite effectively.</li>
    <li> These were great for our Halloween props.  We put masks on them and floated them in &amp;#34;bloody water&amp;#34; with a mister and lighting. Also cut out the eyes and put red led lights in them around other parts of the yard.  Very pleased.  Arrived in perfect condition and expertly packed.</li>
    <li> Very much more attractive than some I have bought historically.  And all twelve of them were perfect - normally I receive at least one or two that look as though they have been in some terrible accident....but this is the first time from this supplier and they were all fine.  I am a milliner and use them to display cocktail/small hats and headpieces .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was very speedy and packaging very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna O</li>
    <li> I placed an order when the price was just over thirty bucks. That is a great deal for 12 mannequin heads. The items arrived well packaged. The mannequin heads are of good quality. I bought these specifically as a mask holder. They work fine for certain masks but because of the smaller size, some masks will feel a bit loose on this mannequin head. But overall I am pleased with the price and quality.</li>
    <li> Just as expected, worked well for a haunted house.</li>
    <li> The title really says it all. I ordered these to use at a haunted house I work for and they arrived promptly. Also, they were exactly as described.</li>
    <li> nice quality and super fast shipping</li>
    <li> My hat collection looks great in my closet sitting on these!</li>
    <li> Very small, my wigs and hats cover the whole head and face :( very disappointing. Also looks more like alien in person.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried, before they arrived, that these would be too light to hold up. I&#x27;m a costumer and some of my wigs are very elaborate and HEAVY. I needn&#x27;t have worried at all! These heads are sturdy and beautiful and not only look good on my shelves, but stand up to quite a bit of weight and movement. You can&#x27;t style the wigs on the heads, but traveling with my wigs is a breeze now! These are perfect for storing and showing off wigs, glasses, and even some amount of prosthetics.</li>
    <li> Will order more!! Reorganized my closet.  Great for displaying hats, scarves. I can actually see what I&#x27;m looking for. Thanks</li>
    <li> Bought these wig heads For my 15 year old daughters cosplay wigs. Arrived in a timely matter and in perfect shape. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These heads are perfect for holding and displaying my children&#x27;s wigs. They are great quality and well worth the money! They were shipped fast and well packed. I would definitely buy these again from this seller!</li>
    <li> These heads are perfect for my wig collection. The only thing is there are multiple dents in multiple of the faces so if I were trying to display them I wouldnt be able to show the front. However, they are perfect for what I&#x27;m using them for and the wide base gives more durability then the others out there. I will be buying more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> I shopped around locally and couldn&#x27;t come close to this price.  The heads were shipped promptly and were just as described. As soon as I finish this review, I&#x27;m going to order two dozen more for our theatre arts program.  A cheap and effective way to preserve wigs.</li>
    <li> stryfoam head ok but the only down fall I don&#x27;t like sometime they turn color and you have to throw away only last for about week and have to change head.</li>
    <li> Great for decorating! Worth the inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> I was selling a lot of hats and these heads were perfect to display my hats.  They were inexpensive (I had a lot of hats) and they store easy!  They came promptly and in great condition.  Very happy with them.</li>
