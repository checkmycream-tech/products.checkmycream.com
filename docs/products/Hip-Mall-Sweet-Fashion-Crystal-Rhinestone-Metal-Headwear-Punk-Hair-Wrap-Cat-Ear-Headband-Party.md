    <li> Exactly what I wanted and arrived in less than a week of delivery! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great Quality!!! Absolutely beautiful. My Daughter love it. Super fast delivery!!!</li>
    <li> Came broken. Came lobsided. Also, it was missing a gem. Horrible.</li>
    <li> Comfortable to wear, though the metal can leave you a little sore after removal. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the size of the ears (when my hair was straight they seemed too large ) but my hair is naturally curly and poofy so I love the way they look (2015)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (2017) yeah still super cute -also now I&#x27;m that one girl who always wears cat ears because I literally just started wearing these day-to-day. My original ones lasted me until earlier this year actually. But then I accidentally got hair dye all over them :P</li>
    <li> Headband is amazing quality! Nothing was broken when it arrived, super comfortable~ :-)</li>

    <li> CUTE. bought two first one broke when traveling.</li>
    <li> Cute, but gives me a headache. My head isn&#x27;t large, but it constricts my head. It is metal so I should have known.</li>
    <li> They look super cute, but one of the ears detached from the headband on the first day. I glued it back together. After awhile they pinch your head, so they are not for wearing all day...But they sure do look cute.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly but broke within 2 days</li>
    <li> How cute. After Halloween as a Cat. This is going to my granddaughters to wear. It is really well made and the rhinestones shine so prettily. Arrived very fast.</li>
    <li> I love it, doesn&#x27;t look cheap and is very cute on</li>

    <li> Super cute but one of the ears is coming off. Nothing a little crazy glue cant fix!</li>
    <li> Ear snapped off the headband as soon as I took it out of the box. At least the seller offered a refund, but it was too late to get a replacement for the party!</li>

    <li> Love this. It is very cute and I got tons of compliments on them! I&#x27;ve worn them several times and they still are intact. They arrived in perfect condition as well. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> i was very pleased at its sturdiness and that it wasnt flimsy, however, the ends do dig into your head after a while. i covered the tips with thick fabric and it did the trick!</li>
