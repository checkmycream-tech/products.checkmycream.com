    <li> I received the wrong shade, the labeling is corret but the color is not. The polish is suposed to be more of a Tiffany color; I get it on my nails at my local salon and they were different. I believe it was mixed up with a similar Color Club nail polish named Edie, which is more green than Age of Aquarius. I do like the color, I&#x27;m just disappointed that I was sent the wrong product.</li>
    <li> This chips too much but the color &amp; shipping is good.</li>
    <li> I never received the blue nail polish...blue ming</li>
    <li> Just in case you&#x27;re wondering... This color is that of a mint neon green, think Mint Ice Cream. Its brighter in person.</li>
    <li> i love this color!! but i wiah it would be more minty...</li>
    <li> My little sister&#x27;s favorite color. Looks so cute on your hands and your toes :)</li>
