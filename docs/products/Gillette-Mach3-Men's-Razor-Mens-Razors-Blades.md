      <li>The Mach3 gives a good close shave.  </li>
      <li>This blade cleans my face perfectly and I find it extremely rare to suffer a nick or cut on my face.  </li>

      <li>When I first tried the Mach 3, about 10 years ago, I was very impressed.</li>
      <li>Until I find a better razor, the Mach3 is the one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
      <li>This product is excellent for large areas of shaving.  </li>
      <li>Talk about effective marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette</li>
      <li>I own one and wanted another one.  </li>
      <li>Just a splash of warm water</li>
      <li>first since it seemed to be the latest and greatest model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>One of the older blades on the market,the gillette mach 3 is still one of the best.</li>
      <li>The Gillette Mach3 gives me the best and most consistent shave I have ever had.  </li>
      <li>There is nothing special about it, but it works great.</li>
      <li>It gives very nice and clean shave.</li>
      <li>The Mach3 is the best yet, though I have yet to try the new Fusion</li>
      <li>quick delivery great razor</li>
      <li>The cream keeps my face moisturized and the razor goes over it very easily.</li>
      <li>The shave was exceptional and so smooth.</li>
      <li>Very smooth.</li>
      <li>Using this razor is much better than using a cheapo 1-blade razor.</li>
      <li>I graduated from the Gillette Sensor XL to the Mach 3 many years ago.</li>
      <li>However it should include more refills in the package.</li>
      <li>I love this razor.</li>
      <li>enjoying it.</li>
      <li>great and does its job.&lt;br /&gt;Not much effort required.</li>
      <li>Gillette keeps adding things like batteries and more blades but who needs it?</li>
      <li>Until someone can prove to me that there is a better razor out there, we&#x27;re sticking with the Mach 3.</li>
      <li>this helps, I got this razor because some of the reviews I read were similar to what I do and it worked out perfectly.</li>
      <li>Kept forgetting to buy at Walgreens (who would have charged me more anyway).  </li>
      <li>The most money you can get, right?&lt;br /&gt;B)</li>
      <li>Love this razor.  </li>
      <li>the Mach III is more than \\&quot;something cheap\\&quot; -- it gives a closer, easier shave than the electric razors.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Coupled with a quality shaving cream like Bigelow Menthol (http://www.amazon.com/CO-Bigelow-Premium-Menthol-Eucalyptus/dp/B002L03N74/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1361632447&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;bigelow+shaving+cream) I&#x27;ve been getting better shaves than I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
      <li>So, PERSONALLY, the Gillette Mach 3 is the best razor for my beard.</li>
      <li>Now we have to pay more.</li>
      <li>My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  </li>
      <li>and it works magically with the razor.  </li>
      <li>The disposables are better and lots cheaper.</li>
      <li>Electric razors can be okay in a pinch</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find the Mach-3 didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
      <li>I thought the 3 blade thing would give me a better shave than disposables</li>
      <li>I have never not been able to cut myself and get severe irritation no matter if I used Gillette or Schick.</li>
      <li>i tried various brands, the  Mach 3 is the best!!.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I did that mistake... :-)</li>
      <li>Much better value than any disposable razor that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shick Quattro works much better for me &amp; also allows against the grain shaving.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aside from the precision blade, I think the Mach3 outperforms the Fusion and gives me the better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Mach3 feels much more substantial and I&#x27;m sure the handle is some type of metal.  </li>
      <li>We all love it when we find a razor that does not turn out faces to hamburger meat.</li>
      <li>Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \\&quot;fins\\&quot; or</li>
      <li>but it seems to be a good razor and the price is right.  </li>
      <li>I forgot how much I enjoy a good clean razor shave.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve generally found cheap shaving cream to work best with this razor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is excellent for large areas of shaving.  I use it in the shower to shave my head.  But it is not good for trimming in small areas.  I have a goatee and trimming around lips and cutting the \\&quot;T\\&quot; on my chin is nearly impossible with this razor because of it&#x27;s head width.</li>
    <li> I got my first Mach3 when I registered for Selective Service.  That was 10 years ago, and I&#x27;m still using them today.  Although I&#x27;ve tried the Mach3 Turbo, the M3 Power, and the Mach3 disposables, I always end up going back to the original.  It&#x27;s as good today as it was then and I&#x27;m so glad the U.S. Government sent me one as thanks for signing up for the draft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mach 3 since 2000. It is the best razor, and I&#x27;ve yet to find one to compare. I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. Shouldn&#x27;t technology make products cheaper over time? Mach 3 has become more expensive. Still it&#x27;s a good razor with an equally high premium.</li>
    <li> Not much better than a disposable double edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shick Quattro works much better for me &amp; also allows against the grain shaving. I&#x27;m 56 years od with a medium beard that grows staight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-16-2012: After one blade, now the subsequent blade shaves much better. I seem to remember the last time I switched brands my beard had to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like Quattro better &amp; am switching back as soon as these are used-up.</li>
    <li> This is a really good razor, it always gives me a good shave (and I have pretty tough facial hair), so you know, it does its job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that yes, the blades are kinda pricey, but I usually combat that by not shaving so often. Come on, I&#x27;m a college student, I can be fuzzy. But this is a great razor, give it a try if you think you&#x27;re a little rough. Sorry I can&#x27;t go into too much more detail... but it&#x27;s a razor. It does its job well, what else can I say?</li>
    <li> I upgraded to the Mach 3 from a Wiltech (Wilkinson Sword) two-blade system. The shave is certainly less smooth, but the shaver/blade system feels much safer. I&#x27;ve used it for about two weeks now and have no cuts. The older system used to cut fairly frequently, but gave me a smoother shave. It was way cheaper as well. Overall I prefer the Mach 3 though and will not go back.</li>
    <li> Have several razors and like Mach3 best - size fits hand better than other models and blades are cheaper than other models</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and this is my first time ever using a razor. This razor is fantastic. I used it along with some Gilette shaving cream. The cream keeps my face moisturized and the razor goes over it very easily. The few bumps I had even went down. Gives you a very close shave. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot of pressure to shave either. The hair comes off almost effortlessly.</li>
    <li> I graduated from the Gillette Sensor XL to the Mach 3 many years ago. I have since tried a few new models thinking that perhaps one of these new razors might work better... but I keep coming back to this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mach 3 is so far, the only replaceable blade razor that I have found I can easily, properly shave my head without nicks and cuts.  The blades tend to wear fairly quickly compared with the Shick Hydro 5, but what is the use of longer lasting blades that slice my head to ribbons?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is a great improvement on the Sensor XL, more heft, better wet grip.  The blades are easy to attach and remove.  They last me a couple of weeks on average, but I shave my head every two to three days and shave my neck below my beard every day.  That&#x27;s a lot of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did start using a new shave gel and it works magically with the razor.  No more issues with serious gumming up of the blades.  Check out [[ASIN:B001QVG90C King of Shaves AlphaGel Shave Gel Sensitive - 5 oz.]].  It&#x27;s expensive for a shave gel, but nothing works better for shaving my head and preventing the shave gel/cream from gumming the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the replacement blades are expensive, and many third party sellers are reselling stolen merchandise... but that&#x27;s part of why they are expensive.  Those of us who are buying the blades on the up and up are paying for all those stolen and re-sold packages.  So I just recommend buying from a store or trusted seller rather than eBay.  Also watch for replacement blades not sold in retail packaging.  Often these are either knock offs or have &#x27;fallen off a truck&#x27;.  Spend the extra $5 and make sure you are getting the quality blades from a reliable source.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good razor and Works. This is Gillette&#x27;s older model you can get the new stuff for the same money. I found a NIB set of 15 blades for $3 at a yard sell and needed a handle for them that is why I bought this.</li>
    <li> Will buy when these get dull. About one full year after I buy them. Long lasting and a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different razors and have always found my way back to the mach3.</li>
    <li> The product I got was not the correct product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The product that I received was to be sold only in India. It clearly said Rs. 99/- only. It is illegal - It is shame for such a big seller to be part of an ugly incident.&lt;br /&gt;2. The product that I bought clearly said that there would be two cartridges; however, the one I got has only \\&quot;One\\&quot; attached to the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Amazon to let such sellers sell such cheap and illegal stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real shame!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many razors over the years including various electrics, and when I don&#x27;t have a beard I always come back to the Mach3. The Mach3 was introduced by Gillette in 1998, and while I don&#x27;t remember exactly when I bought a Mach3 set (or \\&quot;system,\\&quot; i.e., a handle and two blades), it was probably in 1998 or 1999. Since then I&#x27;ve gone through a number of blades but have never replaced the handle, because I haven&#x27;t had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a pretty tough beard and have to shave daily if I want (or feel obliged) to look clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the current Wikipedia entry for the Mach3, the blades cost 9 cents to produce. I&#x27;ve read conflicting stories about the history of disposable razor blades and I&#x27;m not sure what to believe. But it seems to me that disposable razor blades and cartridge type blades in particular, like printer inks, are high profit margin items that deserve to be characterized as ripoffs. I recently tried using old fashioned double edge razors, the kind I stated with when I started shaving in the last sixties - I not only have my own old double-edge blade holder but have two even older ones that I inherited from my late dad - but as has always been my experience, I could not get through a shave without an annoying cut or two (and then I end up going out with little pieces of bloody tissue stuck to my face). If I thought I could get a clean, bloodless shave with a straight razor I&#x27;d go that route. Electric razors can be okay in a pinch but it takes too much time and effort for me to get a really clean shave with an electric, and even then it&#x27;s never as clean as the shave I can get with a Mach3. (I discovered Aveeno shave gel a few years ago and though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve found that it works better for me than any other gel or cream I&#x27;ve used.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, not all guys have as good an experience with the Mach3 as I&#x27;ve had, and that makes sense, because every guy&#x27;s beard and skin is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have more than a couple of day&#x27;s growth, I find it easier to go over my beard with an electric before applying gel and using a Mach3; otherwise the Mach3 has to do too much work.e more than a couple of day&#x27;s growth, I find it easier to go over my beard with an electric before applying gel and using a Mach3; otherwise the Mach3 has to do too much work.</li>
    <li> With previous razors, it was not uncommon for me to suffer minor cuts while shaving. I have never once had a cut with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evidently the battery vibration system in concert with the three bladed razors works well. I also get the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever been used to. Tip: Run the blade with the whiskers, then make another pass lightly \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot;. You&#x27;ll wind up with completely smooth skin, no razor burn, and no cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are pricey, but in my experience last longer than the blades I&#x27;d used for decades before. When you beging to feel any pulling at all, they are ready to change. Under normal circumstances you won&#x27;t feel this shave against your whiskers at all. You can use the blades for a while after you start to feel a pull ... it still does the job and will just feel like your old razor did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor and these blades give me the most comfortable shave above the lip that I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I have a pretty bristly bit of whiskers there, and have experienced lifelong pain shaving that area. I do get a pull feel there even with this razor with new blades, but no pain, and a relatively easy pass to shave there. I do not use the \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot; tip there tho, LOL, just a second pass with the grain but with a bit of extra pressure to get it close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this razor for a few years now and am delighted. I haven&#x27;t tried the newer Fusion, but feel no need to.</li>
    <li> The Mach3 gives a good close shave.  It&#x27;s reliable -- and even sleek-looking.  The blade cartridges cost way too much, in my opinion, but the product itself is a solid one.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Mach 3 has to be the best razor ever, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a back up to my remaining Mach 3 shaver, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;They can come up with all of these newer \\&quot;better\\&quot; razors but none will ever beat this Mach 3. I shave EOD &amp; recently bought thru Amazon what is planned to be a lifetime supply of blades so as never to be disappointed with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes.&lt;br /&gt;Bill in FL</li>
    <li> I switched back to razor shaving after using a Norelco for years. I forgot how much I enjoy a good clean razor shave. I purchased the [[ASIN:B000BUUVTE Gillette Fusion Manual Razor]] first since it seemed to be the latest and greatest model.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have known how much discomfort having so many blades can create. The Fusion worked fine when I didn&#x27;t miss a day, but I paid a painful price if I skipped a day or two of shaving. This wasn&#x27;t an old razor, and the Fusion&#x27;s 5 blades caught my hair like sticky tape and pulled and yanked as I moved the razor down my face. It wasn&#x27;t a pretty site ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research I figured I&#x27;d try the Mach-3. I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a few days and figured this was going to hurt. I was pleased to find the Mach-3 didn&#x27;t hurt at all. I just had to make a few more passes due to the amount of hair I was shaving, but it never hurt and I never cut myself either. Daily shaving is not much different than the Fusion, but the Mach-3 really pays off when I hit a thick patch of hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;m going to stick with the razor for a while. I may go the way of the older style safety razors eventually but for now I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you (like me) who like to use the cup/brush/bar, the Mach-3 also seems to be the standard blade the brush holder/cup combo kits standardized on. This razor has a good reputation.</li>
    <li> After a long shall we say \\&quot;experiment\\&quot; of trying a fair few shaving systems, gilletes&#x27; range of mach 3, mach 3 turbo and m3 power razors seem to do the job best. other straight razors, disposables/non disposables, either felt too dangerous or clogged up easily, or the razors simply had a lack of variety with the design which gets boring if you have to use that razor evey day. so i got a rather expensive philishave (norelco in the states) which was incredibly close but it missed bits when used as instructed not to mention made my neck feel and look like someone has rubbed mild acid onto it, even after 4 weeks use on the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting. All types of mach 3&#x27;s produce an equal shave which is at the same time, close and the blades clean out well under a hot tap. but the overriding factor that made me come back to them was the 7 variaties of handle to choose from, so now i can have a different razor for every day of the week which overall makes shaving everyday more tolerable. i dont personally believe in the micro-pulses of the m3 power but the vibrations themselves must enhance the the performance somehow. if your thinking of buying one of the mach 3&#x27;s then go for it, as you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> The reason to buy this razor is so you won&#x27;t have to think about shaving. There&#x27;s no special technique, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it&#x27;s disinclined to cut you. It doesn&#x27;t feel as sharp as a BIC disposable or cheaper two-blade systems, but shaves smoother and with fewer strokes. Gillette sent me my Mach 3 when I turned 18. Almost ten years on, I&#x27;m using the same handle, and I&#x27;ve since bought another for travel. Talk about effective marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette also makes 5-blade and vibrating razors. Neither is an upgrade to me. I can&#x27;t feel my face with the M3 Power or the Fusion ProGlide. The extra blades on the Fusion just add bulk; they don&#x27;t reduce the stroke-count, but they do cost 20% more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mach 3 blades from Gillette last three or four great shaves and perhaps eight more acceptable ones. Counterfeit blades are very common, even from Amazon if certain reviews are to believed, and won&#x27;t fare as well. I&#x27;ve bought blades from Greatrazors instead since 2007. The science behind what they do sounds like nonsense, but the blades last until well after the lubricant strip has worn away: a month at least, maybe two. Long enough to forget when I last changed them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve generally found cheap shaving cream to work best with this razor. I flirted with gel for a few months, but ultimately found it too slick, less effective, and harder to get off my face. The only negative of the Mach 3 is that it&#x27;s difficult to get a sharp line under my sideburns. The first blade is too far from the end of the razor, and if it&#x27;s been a few weeks since a haircut, the trim line becomes more of a taper than an edge. Nitpicking, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A safety razor would probably give you a closer cut, but if shaving is something you dispense with rather than an event to relish, the Mach 3 is where it&#x27;s at.</li>
    <li> Fellas,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  We all love it when we find a razor that does not turn out faces to hamburger meat. This one for me is that razor. Simple math on ordering it from Amazon. I checked my three \\&quot;locals\\&quot; 14.99 at CVS 15.49 at Walgreens and 13.24 at Wal Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I paid what a little over eight bucks for it here and got free shipping with prime? Simple math fellas just buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I never realized that my Mach 3 handle was a &amp;#34;Classic,&amp;#34; it did a good job and the replacement blades were not quite as expensive as the newer &amp;#34;non-classic&amp;#34; Mach 3s.  The original handle corroded away after several years, so I got this and I am back in business.</li>
    <li> I had used a Mach Fusion for over a year.  Not the same blade the whole time of course.  I would change the blade every 1.5 to 2 months and I noticed a little discomfort after 2 weeks of usage.  The Fusion also has the option of vibration to aid in comfort but I stopped using that function after the batteries wore out.  It didn&#x27;t help all that much.  3 months ago I accidentally purchased the Mach3 blades.  I thought they would fit the Fusion shaving system but it didnt.  So instead of trying to return an open package of blades, I just bought a Mach3 system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away I noticed a difference in build quality.  The Fusion system felt like plastic.  The Mach3 feels much more substantial and I&#x27;m sure the handle is some type of metal.  With the Mach 3, I only felt the same kind of discomfort closer to 4 weeks after usage and I notices my blades don&#x27;t clog up as much as the Fusion blades do.  The thing I do miss is the precision blade on the back of the Fusions to clean up my side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the precision blade, I think the Mach3 outperforms the Fusion and gives me the better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  [[ASIN:B001GIOV1O Burt&#x27;s Bees Men&#x27;s Shave Cream, 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]] is not better than Nivea or Gillette shaving gel.  [[ASIN:B000JL79HW Jack Black Beard Lube Conditioning Shave - 6 oz]] although expensive, is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used.  Even with a not so sharp blade, it does wonders.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these since they came out. great handle and amazing blades. This is the BEST RAZOR ever!</li>
    <li> My fiance&#x27; got me hooked on using his razor after I forgot mine on a trip.  I have to say it is the best and closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  It didn&#x27;t feel like I was scraping my skin off with my hair.  Cost isn&#x27;t so bad compared so some other shaving systems.</li>
    <li> Gillette is best razor brand. I bought this around 3 years ago and I am refilling cartridges periodically. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is the only one my husband will use, and I&#x27;m so glad he does! His face is always so smooth and soft. These never cause him any irritation at all and the shave is super close! HIghly recommend! (Lol---not to mention that I occasionally steal it for myself--shhh, don&#x27;t tell!)</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with these modern 5 blade razors for quite a while. I have never not been able to cut myself and get severe irritation no matter if I used Gillette or Schick. I finally decided to go back to a trusty Mach3 and I could not be happier. No cuts, no irritation, just a smooth, comfortable shave, just like I remembered.</li>
    <li> I have used disposal razors (great when you have the facial hair of a teenager), electric razors (pretty good for a while, but the replacement blades are expensive), and several generations of Gillette razors.  The Mach3 is the best yet, though I have yet to try the new Fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette makes all sorts of claims regarding the Mach3.  I am unable to tell whether any of the claims have merit.  I can tell you that the blades, though expensive, last a long time for me.  I have moderately tough facial hair.  The old disposable razors gave me a few days of shaving and they were history.  I have shaved up to two months with these razors and still got a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that there are controversies about the value of three blades.  I think the three blades help keep the razor at the optimum angle on my face for shaving.  I do get a pretty good shave as well.  I do use Edge Advanced Shave Gel in combination with my Gillette Mach3, which may help get me a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most men in the United States shave, whether we like it or not.  The Gillette Mach3 gives me the best and most consistent shave I have ever had.  Until I find a better razor, the Mach3 is the one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Not much to say beyond it&#x27;s a great razor with great design.  Cleans easily and gives a great shave!</li>
    <li> As far as clsoe shaves go, TECHNICALLY (performance wise)it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. The blades glide over my face, and keep me from becoming a stubble road. Great design too!&lt;br /&gt;Now for the complaints.&lt;br /&gt;A) The cost is REALLY ridiculous-gee, thanks a lot Gillette. The most money you can get, right?&lt;br /&gt;B) The blades don&#x27;t keep after about three shaves. THe lub strip goes, and the blades start to go too.&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t tell me to switch to Mach 3 Turbo....even as much of a waste, although the lube strip stays on longer. Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Ah, Mach 3. If ya was cheaper, I&#x27;d be shaving with you more.&lt;br /&gt;So long Mach 3....you&#x27;re just a Mach 2 to me. ontario</li>
    <li> This is an extremely good razor.  It definitely gets the stubble with fewer strokes than generic disposable razors.  I am only giving 4 stars however because the replacement blades cost can accumulate over time.</li>
    <li> I had an Atra for at least twenty years with no problems, but lately I couldn&#x27;t find the blades in any of my three local pharmacies.So I coughed up the money for a Mach3. All the moving parts on my Atra were made out of some type of metal. Not so with the Mach3. Somehow I broke the piece of flimsy plastic which holds the blade in place rendering the razor useless. So I just bought three packs of Atra blades off the internet.  p.s. The blade the razor came with was great. I got great shaves. Unfortunately,the remaining other three or so razors were dull.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! A great way to shop... I recomended for everyone. You get what you want without moving from ypur home</li>
    <li> They are the best razors to own.  I have never ever cut or nicked myself with this razor. I own one and wanted another one.  Worth every penny!!!!</li>
    <li> Using this razor is much better than using a cheapo 1-blade razor. Why? It doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much. there is less \\&quot;pull\\&quot; when shaving, which, prior to this purchase was a very painful experience. And while it does reduce the amount of pull, it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate it, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. For me, its good enough for now.</li>
    <li> Mediocre and Overpriced, March 13, 2008&lt;br /&gt;By  supernatural (Illinois) - See all my reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortuantely, these mediocre and overpriced blades are probably the best shave that most people will get from the mass produced blades and shaver systems. It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I&#x27;ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don&#x27;t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades. Here are a few other points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor? With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \\&quot;fins\\&quot; or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \\&quot;prep\\&quot; your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin. Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor. My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn! I can shave everyday now. I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \\&quot;classic shaving\\&quot; to find them for cheaper. The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people. Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.ade cartridges.</li>
    <li> One of the older blades on the market,the gillette mach 3 is still one of the best. A little overpriced for replacement blades. This is one of the few razors my skin can tolerate.</li>
    <li> It says that it has 1 razor and two cartridges. Actually it has one handle and two cartridges. I don&#x27;t consider the handle without a cartridge a razor. I expected to get a total of three cartridges, one in the \\&quot;razor\\&quot; and two others. I didn&#x27;t get that.</li>
    <li> I grew up with cheap plastic disposable razors.  A couple of years ago I tried the Mach 3 and I haven&#x27;t turned back.  Oh, I have tried a few other products, just to see if something was better.  The Schick Quattro my wife gave me (after getting a coupon for a free one) found itself at the city landfill after 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;I have a full, thick beard and fairly sensitive skin.  This blade cleans my face perfectly and I find it extremely rare to suffer a nick or cut on my face.  The handle is perfectly designed and bends to the contour of my face.  The blades pop in and out easily.&lt;br /&gt;One drawback is that the blades are just a bit pricy.  But, the blades also last as long as three of the disposable blades I used to use.  The moisturizing strip could last a little longer, but it isn&#x27;t a major factor for me.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product a 5 because it is the best razor I have found.  I will keep trying to use new razors to see if someone can beat it, but, until then, I am staying with the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> I thought the 3 blade thing would give me a better shave than disposables I&#x27;d been using.  WRONG.  The disposables are better and lots cheaper.</li>
    <li> quick delivery great razor</li>
    <li> The razor performs well, but the cartridges are expensive. I switched to Dorco, a Korean brand, which shaves just as well (much better than Schick or other budget brands), and is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> For years and years I used some variation of the Gillette Trac 2.  These blades gave me a decent shave, and I had no real reason to complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t remember when I first started using Gillette Mach 3, but I could definitely tell the difference from the first shave.  My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it.  It was much smoother than any other razor I&#x27;d ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed, however, that it doesn&#x27;t take that long before the shave isn&#x27;t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.  And then, at some point, I realize it&#x27;s just not doing the job anymore, and I put in a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the handle, and I&#x27;ve been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints.  I solve the price problem of the replacement blades by buying them in bulk on either Ebay or Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular deal for one razor and two cartridges at $3.19 is a great deal.  Get it at this price!</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d kept my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one, with it&#x27;s expensive replacement blades, gives me a fit with razor burn on my upper lip. God forbid I miss a spot there and have to go back over it because when I do, I can count on an irritated, red upper lip that dries and flakes after a short while. I&#x27;ve never had that problem before this. Now I have to buy sensitive skin shave cream. How I miss my old Gillette Sensor Excel. Two blades that did the job. I think these multi-blade razors are a con actually. Now we have to pay more.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor and the blades that come with it are cheaper than the fusion and other modern blades. Provides a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Shaving is about as personal thing you can do. It&#x27;s not an experience you can share. It doesn&#x27;t make for scintillating conversation. So, PERSONALLY, the Gillette Mach 3 is the best razor for my beard. My beard is pretty tough: to use the belabored joke, my five o&#x27;clock shadow makes its appearance around noon. And it&#x27;s thick. However, the skin underneath is very sensitive. This razor gives me that \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; without irritating my face. The price for the cartidges are, yes, a little high. But it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a product that works. It&#x27;s sort of like paying a little extra for \\&quot;bathroom tissues\\&quot;. (But that&#x27;s another personal thing we do alone that rarely makes for scintillating conversation.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mach3 for years and was surprised to find it still available. Great design, does a great job and blades are long lasting.</li>
    <li> I only use the Gillette Mach3 razor.  The blades are long lasting when kept clean and dry.  The head also hangs on well when you tap it on the side of the sink.  The same can not be said for the Mach3 Turbo.  Turbo piece of crap that thing is.  Stick with the classic Mach3 and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I find that the Gillette Sensor 3 gives a far superior shave that the Mach3 for no other reason than the head swivels too much.  I consider this a waste of money.</li>
    <li> For most of my life I have been a Norelco / Braun user, but the latest Braun got to be a real irritation because it would send me off to buy more cleaning fluid once a month.  In Thailand, that was $25 a month!  And then it cried out for replacement blades, which were another hassle and another $75.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got sick of the whole routine, bought a Mach III, and put the Braun in the trash a few weeks later.  The Mach III works beautifully -- in the past two years I haven&#x27;t had a single nick (no blood!) and not even a hint of discomfort.  I replace the blades about once a month or so, but that&#x27;s a $3 item, not $25 -- and that $3 covers the $75 cost of replacing the Braun blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the Mach III is more than \\&quot;something cheap\\&quot; -- it gives a closer, easier shave than the electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up on razor blades years ago, when they would nick me and cause discomfort.  But that was 40 years ago, and the caravan most definitely has moved on!!  :-)</li>
    <li> As a 36 yo male, I&#x27;m cursed with strong and persistent beard. It all started some 20 years ago and even after all these years of shaving, I still find it mind-numbing and boring. So, I need a nice, sharp razor that will help me get it done fast and without cuts. Nothing shots your day quite like bleeding on your new shirt just before you&#x27;re supposed to go to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so far I&#x27;ve used cheap Gillette disposable razors and they did a find job. My beard is quite strong and I need sharp blade and on top of that my skin is made or some kind X-Men alloy or something similar so I don&#x27;t use any gel or foam when shaving - they actually make things worse for me. Just a splash of warm water and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Gillette Mach3. I have to admit that I&#x27;m impressed - smooth ride all over, even with short, fast cuts around the jaw bone. Neck is happily void of any cuts so far, which makes my laundry lady much happier person now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a down side, this thing feels a bit overpriced for my taste. If you decide to give it a go, buy razors in bulk online, retail stores will charge you an arm and a leg for them (usually).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, miles ahead of competition. BIC, I&#x27;m looking at you.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it just makes sense to shell out the additional funds for a superior product. I have a very tough and fast-growing beard that is a challenge to all the different razors (manual and electric) I&#x27;ve tried over the past 45 years.  I have stayed with the Mach 3 ever since it first came out and even convinced my wife that it would be good for shaving her legs. Actually she picked it up once instead of using her usual disposable and from then on I kept finding my razor in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned a long time ago when using knives and axes that a good cutting edge needs to be complimented by a proper handle.  Normally the heavier and more durable the handle, the better the cut.  The Mach 3 handle is slightly beefier than most and it makes a difference, resulting in a good angle during application and a smoother shave with no irritation.  Until someone can prove to me that there is a better razor out there, we&#x27;re sticking with the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 since it came out when I was in college sometime in the early 90&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t need anything fancy and only have to shave every couple days or so. Gillette keeps adding things like batteries and more blades but who needs it? Keep it simple and do the job. This is a plus on both.</li>
    <li> i like this product i t came in two days, little expensive but it is very good quality. enjoying it.</li>
    <li> if you want a smooth razor opt for this one ir glides smooth on the face and it is safer than one blade</li>
    <li> Love the the quality and close shave i get from these razors, i love the stand and very good for travel.</li>
    <li> I bought this off Amazon after my M3 Power Razor broke the first time I dropped it in the shower!  That was the second M3 Power that broke in the same place, so I reverted back to the Classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This give you a great shave, and the cartridges are considerably less than the current generation of razors...</li>
    <li> good product and deal</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  The original mach 3.</li>
    <li> Impressed by this product. It gives very nice and clean shave. If you already have the blades and you want to order the handle, make sure you are ordering the right one... I did that mistake... :-)</li>
    <li> My all time favorite for shaving my legs and bikini area!! Ladies please give this razor a try, it works really well and cuts down on my shaving time.. I&#x27;m lucky my boyfriend uses this brand, cause I would never gotten the opportunity to try it</li>
    <li> Do you realize how dumb it is to ask me to review something you have yet to ship me. You keep pushing back the ship date. meanwhile the package of cartridges for it you encouragded me to buy came 6 days after I placed the oder. Is going on 4 weeks now and still waiting for the razor.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the best razors because it gets the job done, is very affordable, and does not cause cuts. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a regular razor. There is nothing special about it, but it works great.</li>
    <li> Loved it. I use this every day and you can&#x27;t beat Gillette. Super sharp with amazing comfort. I would 100% recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  I have been using quality disposals for years but after using this one, will not go back to a disposal.  Lasts a long time and keeps sharp</li>
    <li> I recently switched from the Gillette Atra plus (double edge blade) to the Mach 3. I always thought the 3 blade razors would be too big. I do not have a large face but it gets the job done much quicker. I can even go 2 months on a single mach 3 blade. (I shave every other day so that equals out to 30 shaves per blade). These blades are sharp and will last a few months. With the Atra blades, I was only getting 10- 15 shaves per blade. I can make a pack of 10 blades last 20 months - The Gillette Mach 3 shaving system is very affordable in the long run. I cannot forsee me changing shaving systems for at least 15 years. Mach 3 is the best!</li>
    <li> working great and does its job.&lt;br /&gt;Not much effort required.&lt;br /&gt;working great and does its job.&lt;br /&gt;Not much effort required.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It&#x27;s solid, sturdy, and you can really feel the close shave after using it. It&#x27;s all made of metal and the razor blades face at an easy to use angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The refills for the razor blades do cost a lot even though the razor is cheap, so I&#x27;m not looking forward to buying new cartridges, but as far as this product goes, it&#x27;s brilliant.</li>
    <li> The best razor I have ever had.  I don&#x27;t need 16 blades like all the newer razors have....3 is enough.  I like the mach 3.</li>
    <li> excellent product recommend 100%</li>
    <li> the title says it all, Gillette makes one of the best razors out there!!.  i tried various brands, the  Mach 3 is the best!!. i personally think it&#x27;s better than the pro-glide.</li>
    <li> I have owned the Mach3 before and came back to it. The 3-blade cartridge seems to work best for me. It is a solid razor.</li>
    <li> A whole new way of shaving, I never cut myself with these razors (I upgraded from the Sensor) and am glad I did.</li>
    <li> Needed this before traveling out of town.  Kept forgetting to buy at Walgreens (who would have charged me more anyway).  So, added this to a bulk order of deodorant and hair gel, and this worked like a charm.  Shipped on time.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this for over 10 years, and although he has tried the new 4- and 5-blade razors, he continues to go back to this one for an easy, good shave.  We hope they continue to make this.  We bought this one to replace one that it at least 5 years old, but it could be much older. We lost track. Definitely durable. The blades are a little expensive, but he only needs a new one every 6 weeks or so.</li>
    <li> I shave every other day just cause my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like a rough beard. Anyway there is not tug and pull on the blade. I can use this blade for 2-3 more shaves after (depending on if i skipped a day) after the light green bar fades completely.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using the gillette fusion (original one) but it tears my skin up. This blade is easy to use and I have dropped it several times and it hasnt broke, very durable. Plus the replacement blades are expensive as others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps, I got this razor because some of the reviews I read were similar to what I do and it worked out perfectly.</li>
    <li> This provides a fairly smooth shave, but it doesn&#x27;t do as well as some disposables I&#x27;ve used. C- for blade life as well.</li>
    <li> Like this Product much.. Great price for 2 blades and the Razor. I would use &amp; recommend Gillette for future buyings</li>
    <li> I think the gillete fusion proglide is better than this, but for the price it&#x27;s decent.  I thought this was going to come with 2 extra razors, but it did not.  Weird.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t too much to say about it but it seems to be a good razor and the price is right.  I like it.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for my 10 year old razor.  The old one had two blades in the cartridge. This one shaves a lot smoother.</li>
    <li> I bought this instead of a disposable razor for travel. I was amazed at the quality of the shave. I was traveling in Haiti and twice people observed that I had no beard. It was the closeness of the shave. Very smooth. Much better value than any disposable razor that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great gift for any man! This razor works great! refill cartridges are super expensive but so arent all razors.! Id reccomend</li>
    <li> Gillette knew they had a good product, so they gave them away to high school seniors who were renting tuxedos for prom. Soon these young men would be purchasing their own shaving tools. It worked, because they&#x27;ve had me as a regular customer for the past 15 years. I use the Fusion for my face and the Mach 3 for any other area that needs to become hair-free. Tip for razor burn, regardless of what product you&#x27;re using or where you&#x27;re using it. Get a spray bottle like this: [[ASIN:B000NIY7QM Fantasea Fine Mist Spray Bottle]] and put some [[ASIN:B000GCLU4W Hibiclens antimicrobial and antiseptic skin cleanser liquid]] in it. Spray your razors before each time you use them. Razor burn is caused by a staph infection and the Hibiclens kills the bacteria.</li>
    <li> For the last two years I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Schick Quattro razor. I&#x27;ve had the typical shaving mindset: if a razor has more blades it must be better, right? I started shaving with a single blade disposable Bic razor, then a Gillette Sensor Excel, a Mach 3, the Gillette Fusion, then the Quattro. When I first tried the Mach 3, about 10 years ago, I was very impressed. It shaved me closer than any razor ever had, and the quality of the shave was impeccable. I only switched away because I was lured by the promise of a better shave by other, newer, razors. Over time I forgot about the Mach 3 and learned how to tolerate the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim I decided to go back to basics and try a Mach 3 again. I read the reviews and saw that people were still gushing about how good the system is. I purchased it and have used it for a few days now and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s great. With only three blades the shaving cream and hairs don&#x27;t clog up the razor like they did on the Quattro. Coupled with a quality shaving cream like Bigelow Menthol (http://www.amazon.com/CO-Bigelow-Premium-Menthol-Eucalyptus/dp/B002L03N74/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1361632447&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;bigelow+shaving+cream) I&#x27;ve been getting better shaves than I&#x27;ve had in years. The best part - no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s telling when a lot of the premium shaving kits (handles, brush, mug, and stand) are built to accept Mach 3 blades. For me, the plain Gillette handle and blade, coupled with a good shaving cream (not anything that comes out of a can) and brush work wonders. I&#x27;m happy to be reunited with a Mach 3 and don&#x27;t see myself ever switching away again.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The shave was exceptional and so smooth. I recommend it. However it should include more refills in the package.</li>
