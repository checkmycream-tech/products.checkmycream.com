      <li>Both will achieve a good lather, but the Badger Bristle - even if just &amp;#34;Pure Badger&amp;#34</li>
      <li>The razor has a good weight to it and also feels good to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so one side is sort of good while one side is not.</li>
      <li>Maybe thats a good thing?</li>
      <li>They are not the best, but for me it felt like it was given to me for free for this price</li>
      <li>Hubby is still learning this method of shaving but says the badger brush feels good on his face.  </li>
      <li>Water proof brush and good quality.</li>
      <li>Good set.</li>
      <li>Good design &amp; weight of product.  </li>
      <li>faster, easier, drier - just not as good a shave as a blade.</li>
      <li>The brush does a good job of creating lather.</li>
      <li>Good balance and weight.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Badger Brush:&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a good entry level brush that has a sort of break in period in which you need to rinse it out well.</li>
      <li>Good functional set-up, very pleased with each component.</li>
      <li>Good shave, nice set, seems to be of good quality.</li>
      <li>unboxing this kit, I was very pleased with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did a lot of research before buying a DE razor and I have been very satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>This brush, while does indeed work, and is an authentic badger brush, isnt that great.</li>
      <li>I love this set!</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this kit has to be the fact that it feels as if I got a barber quality shave!</li>
      <li>When I saw &amp;#34;Perfecto Deluxe...</li>
      <li>The stand is nice.  </li>
      <li>The brush is a genuine badger brush and is a very nice starter brush.  </li>
      <li>The brush is very soft and applies the cream perfectly!</li>
      <li>Good pack,the razor is precise, no scars.</li>
      <li>It is a suitable re-entry -- or introduction -- to double-edge shaving.</li>
      <li>Buying a stand separately costs more than I was looking to spend so to get it bundled with the razor and brush</li>
      <li>I enjoyed shaving with this product.</li>
      <li>My husband love the boar brush that came with the set more than the beaver one in the soap kit I bought.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t get a better price.</li>
      <li>The razor&#x27;s lamina is reusable many times and great for fast shavings.</li>
      <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It lasts way longer and is way more efficient.</li>
      <li>and I love this set.</li>
      <li>What is not to love?</li>
      <li>Ultimately this kit is an excellent starter kit.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I am very happy with the performance and the above quirks do not affect its use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I searched for a deluxe shaving set, and I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>it was pretty good.</li>
      <li>The shaver gave me an even and clean shave with ease!</li>
      <li>but then my girlfriend said she thought I might look better clean-shaven, so I tried it out with those crappy cheap razors I mentioned already, and it didn&#x27;t go so well.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend for anyone needing a easy and clean shave!</li>
      <li>Other than that, perfect.</li>
      <li>Each of the components detach easily for cleaning.  </li>
      <li>This is  a good starter set for those new into &amp;#34;ritual&amp;#34; shaving (The Art of Shaving style).  </li>
      <li>Gave me 100% satisfaction and with the stand helped me easily store and hold my shaver securely.</li>
      <li>It feels very sturdy and has a nice non slip bottom.  </li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
      <li>If you compare what you get with this set to buying everything separately, you basically get a free razor when choosing the Perfecto.</li>
      <li>It did not come with a razor blade as pictured, fortunately I bought a set.</li>
      <li>The blade does not have a uniform fit in the razor</li>
      <li>Brush sheds more than I like, but totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>stand is great quality and was one of the big reasons I went with this set.</li>
      <li>First shave went pretty good</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>This helps me shave it fast and easy, without any pain!</li>
      <li>In the grand scheme of things - they both work fine, the safety razor does a good job, and the stand allows the brush to dry in the right manner.</li>
      <li>As I am new to wet shaving, this brush seems very good, but as I understand there are much better badger brushes on the market.  </li>
      <li>The razor is solid, with a good feel.</li>
      <li>Overall good price for the set.</li>
      <li>Not a bad set</li>
      <li>Awesome product, gives a closer shave than most expensive razors.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>Its beautiful, its heavy, and has an all around quality to it.  </li>
      <li>; out of this purchase, I will break even and can try with a new razor in my quest to save money and have a better shave.</li>
      <li>Love this new set, it looks sleek as is and the stand with the razor won&#x27;t rust or tarnish if you leave water on them instead of wiping them off when done shaving if you forget.</li>
      <li>but luckily I picked the right one.</li>
      <li>To be clear, this is an entry level product but it is great if you are on a budget or just starting out.</li>
      <li>Great Shaver, the brush works very well and is of much higher quality than other brushes from combo packs.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve decided to get a new Schick Tracer handle, as my old one is kind of corroded, but I will hang it on the Perfecto stand and use the badger brush as well, and use the Taconic Shave Barbershop Quality Bay Rum Shaving Soap with Antioxidant-Rich Hemp Seed Oil&lt;br /&gt;( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L3K6H0I/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 )</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to have gone back to the future and shave like I did 50 years ago.</li>
      <li>After my bad experience trying to get a nice shave with cheap razors (I am a bit of a cheapo), I decided to look on Amazon for a deluxe set, like the ones you see in old-fashioned movies, where the men always have remarkably smooth skin.</li>
      <li>This set is nice because it has at about four different types of high end blades and you&#x27;ll notice that many reviewers chose a different blade: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LOWZRHY</li>
      <li>The razor&#x27;s finish is some type of chrome overcoat that has held up well for the first couple of months since I bought it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this set! My facial hair grows rather quick so I have to constantly be shaving. The set I bought a while ago hasn&#x27;t worn down a bit ever since I got it. The brush is very soft and applies the cream perfectly! My favorite thing about this kit has to be the fact that it feels as if I got a barber quality shave!</li>
    <li> Love this new set, it looks sleek as is and the stand with the razor won&#x27;t rust or tarnish if you leave water on them instead of wiping them off when done shaving if you forget. Just come back later and wipe it off an it will look like new again. The badger brush is also a plus as the handle is real wood along with the bristles being soft to the touch when in use.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, excellent quality, excellent service. What more needs to be said?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the fact that I also will not be going back to disposable razors, I hate throwing those plastic things in the landfill &amp; this razor gives me a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Douglas in the Adirondack Mountains</li>
    <li> ...a little background first...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t shaved with a blade for maybe 25 years now, using a Norelco electric shaver instead. ...faster, easier, drier - just not as good a shave as a blade. I used to use Schick Tracer system after being unable to find Wilkinson injector blades any more, way back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I dragged out my old Tracers and tried it out, even though the &#x27;Lubricating Comfort Strips&#x27; were all bumpy and nasty-looking on the new blades. It worked well and I decided to go for a &#x27;classic&#x27; style razor and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the stand is VERY nice!  Heavy enough to not slide around, and looks like the chrome will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is also VERY nice!&lt;br /&gt;The razor, however was a bit tricky to get the blade in properly, as I had only ever used a &#x27;clamshell&#x27; type razor before, so after a couple of tries, I got it right, gave it a try and I feel like the razor is a little too heavy for me, plus I&#x27;m a bit scared of that blade, too.  I&#x27;m used to the double-bladed Schick with the &#x27;protection&#x27; of the lubricating blade, and it&#x27;s lightness.&lt;br /&gt;I have even used a straight-razor, back in my 20&#x27;s, for a couple of shaves, and that scared me too.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve decided to get a new Schick Tracer handle, as my old one is kind of corroded, but I will hang it on the Perfecto stand and use the badger brush as well, and use the Taconic Shave Barbershop Quality Bay Rum Shaving Soap with Antioxidant-Rich Hemp Seed Oil&lt;br /&gt;( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L3K6H0I/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 ) That I bought at the same time.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Well built and a great brush!</li>
    <li> Good functional set-up, very pleased with each component. Stand is stable with a firm base, finish superb. This is my first Badger Brush and I must say, it is night and day compared to a Boar&#x27;s Bristle Brush. Both will achieve a good lather, but the Badger Bristle - even if just &amp;#34;Pure Badger&amp;#34; rated, is so much softer and carries the lather so much smoother to your beard. In the grand scheme of things - they both work fine, the safety razor does a good job, and the stand allows the brush to dry in the right manner. A good inexpensive kit!</li>
    <li> Perfect for me. I am now to the age where my hair is growing extremely fast to where I cant control it! This helps me shave it fast and easy, without any pain! And it even keeps some time until it starts to grow back! If your afraid of those big razors, ready to cut your lip, buy this!</li>
    <li> This product is spectacular! Gave me 100% satisfaction and with the stand helped me easily store and hold my shaver securely. The shaver gave me an even and clean shave with ease! Would recommend for anyone needing a easy and clean shave!</li>
    <li> This is  a good starter set for those new into &amp;#34;ritual&amp;#34; shaving (The Art of Shaving style).  I purchased my first set from The Art of Shaving and I knew I needed a stand like this.  Knowing how much I paid for the set from that place, the stand from there would be worth another arm and a leg.  But this is an awesome alternative.  The stand itself is comparable for the fraction of the price for their most basic stand.  Plus you get the brush and razor.  They are not the best, but for me it felt like it was given to me for free for this price so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent value. The razor is solid, with a good feel. The brush does a good job of creating lather. The stand is also solid and versatile. If one should decide to change razors or brushes at some point the stand would still work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I decided to return to wet shaving I found it would be easy to spend as much on a razor or brush alone as this entire set. It is a suitable re-entry -- or introduction -- to double-edge shaving. The razor is a three-piece razor, no moving parts or adjustments.  It is about as basic as scrambled eggs. It appears to me it could last one a very long time. Safety razors have been known to last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three basic reasons for returning to a wet shave, in my mind: Frugality, it can save a lot of money over the long haul; Nostalgia, some like to try how their dad or granddad shaved; and Ecology, there is simply less waste of plastic disposable razors, plastic encased blades and empty aerosol cans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one other reason -- it simply gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> I found the kit to be everything it was advertised to be.  All the components seems to be high quality.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get started on shaving with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Good shave, nice set, seems to be of good quality. It did not come with a razor blade as pictured, fortunately I bought a set. I am giving 4 stars for the missing blade, but also because looking back at the reviews, there are a slew of unverified 5 star reviews written at the same time in mid April written with odd grammar and wording. I suspect they are not legitimate.</li>
    <li> Good set. Can&#x27;t get a better price. Brush sheds more than I like, but totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> Good design &amp; weight of product.  Sits well on bathroom counter, but a few badger hairs seem to have come out already with only a couple of uses so far.  Hubby is still learning this method of shaving but says the badger brush feels good on his face.  Overall good price for the set.</li>
    <li> The razor has some serious weight to it and feels comfortable in the hand and gliding across the skin; there&#x27;s a slight downside to the razor in that the blade seems to shift slightly when you close it.  I just carefully hold the ends of the blade while screwing the handle back in place.  The stand is very nice.  Each of the components detach easily for cleaning.  It feels very sturdy and has a nice non slip bottom.  My only complaint about the stand is that the shiny base will catch the occasional drip from the razor and brush and require cleaning every couple of days.  The brush is a genuine badger brush and is a very nice starter brush.  As I am new to wet shaving, this brush seems very good, but as I understand there are much better badger brushes on the market.  Ultimately this kit is an excellent starter kit.  The metal is plated, so it may not last as long as a solid stainless steel razor, but I expect it to last 5-10 years.  Overall I find it to be a bargain and would expect to spend at least $80 on the set if purchased in a brick and mortar store.  If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving, as I am, I recommend that you pick up a nice sampler set of razor blades.  Many of the sampler packs (even highly reviewed ones) had a bulk of poor blades and all reviewers chose the feather blades, to me this creates a false sense of choice. This set is nice because it has at about four different types of high end blades and you&#x27;ll notice that many reviewers chose a different blade: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LOWZRHY</li>
    <li> Not a bad set but the hairs fall out of the brush. I would really recommend spending a few extra bucks and buying a better quality brush. The razor and the stand are everything I wanted though.</li>
    <li> Good pack,the razor is precise, no scars.The brush is soft and helpful after shaving,they are placed on the support with perfection.Water proof brush and good quality.The razor&#x27;s lamina is reusable many times and great for fast shavings.</li>
    <li> The stand is nice.  The brush is nice but not much better than a cheap boar bristle it replaced. The razor is the weak item in the bundle.  The blade does not have a uniform fit in the razor so one side is sort of good while one side is not. You can &amp;#34;hear&amp;#34; the vibrations from the blade when you shave on the bad side, it&#x27;s just not good.  When  I attempted to change blades the handle unscrewed at an unexpected point not allowing me to replace the blade without pliers.</li>
    <li> Very surprised at the quality. No need to spend extra money.</li>
    <li> I always wanted to try a safety razor shave and did a lot of research and went with this set. I made a great choice and I love this set. Looks great in the bathroom on the counter. I got a real good close shave. You just need a little patience. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Wow. I searched for a deluxe shaving set, and I was not disappointed.  I have been using those cheap multi-blade razors you get in big shops, you know, the ones that come in a pack. I never really cared much about my facial hair, and neither cared about having a close shave. I kind of preferred stubble or a small beard to just being clean shaven, but then my girlfriend said she thought I might look better clean-shaven, so I tried it out with those crappy cheap razors I mentioned already, and it didn&#x27;t go so well.  After my bad experience trying to get a nice shave with cheap razors (I am a bit of a cheapo), I decided to look on Amazon for a deluxe set, like the ones you see in old-fashioned movies, where the men always have remarkably smooth skin. When I saw &amp;#34;Perfecto Deluxe...&amp;#34; I immediately clicked on it, and it looked perfect, and along with that, so was the price! Reduced from $89? How could I resist?!  All that said, I really don&#x27;t think I am going back to beards or stubble any time soon. This set is the business! Especially if you don&#x27;t like the sting of cutting yourself, or getting stupid gel in a cut. This is great for a wet shave, but I would advise you to Google how to use a deluxe set like this, because it is quite difficult to get started, especially if you have been using those peasant-razors for so long.  I love it. I will never go back to cheap multi-blade razors again, and also, at this price, its a bargain. It lasts way longer and is way more efficient. What is not to love?</li>
    <li> This is great! I have the brush that is shown on the picture, and the stand is just extremely handy! Now you don&#x27;t have to worry about your brush falling on the ground or whatever would happen to it. The stand has a heavy, rubber bottom, so it does not slip away. If you are looking for a starter shaving set, this is the one you should buy!</li>
    <li> Great Shaver, the brush works very well and is of much higher quality than other brushes from combo packs.</li>
    <li> Would I buy it again? No.  First off the strongest item in this set is the stand. Its beautiful, its heavy, and has an all around quality to it.  As for the brush, I have read a few reviews that say you shouldnt really buy a badger brush unless its a bit more cash. Im gonna go out on a limb here and say I agree. This brush, while does indeed work, and is an authentic badger brush, isnt that great. I can already tell its not gonna last &amp;#34;years&amp;#34;. Maybe it will, but the brush itself will probably be crummy and hairless by the end of one year. I realize its normal for the brush to shed a FEW hairs for the first month or two, but this thing is averaging 7 lost hairs per shave. Maybe I got a bum brush? Probably not, as I go into the razors review, but its far more of a pain in the rear to return this entire set....than to push forward.  Now the razor. You are probably buying this set because you are new to wet shaving (like myself). Be aware that the perfecto razor (which can also be purchased separately outside this kit, is a very &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; shave. Do your homework because you can EASILY take a decent amount of skin off your face with an angle that is too sharp, or a crummy lather. I have a nice area of red scar tissue that is still healing two weeks later. While my technique is definitely improving daily, this razor leaves little room for error, and will let you know when your &amp;#34;skills&amp;#34; are lacking. Maybe thats a good thing? Baptism by fire ya know?  But my BIGGEST problem with this kit is that the razor itself lacks in construction. When you unscrew the handle from the head to change a razor, there is another the handle can unscrew from directly under the primary tightening location. If you are unlucky like me, the handle wont screw off from the head but the handle will unscrew off from itself (if that makes any sense). I was running late for work and needed to change a blade after I noticed the one I had tugging. I attempted to unscrew the handle and the head was locked shut as I unscrewed it from itself. It took me 10 min running around like a buffoon in my underwear trying to get the darn head open. I had to grab PLIERS! from the garage just to get this thing separated. I ended up super gluing the handle back to the small piece it unscrewed from and hopefully this fixes the problem.  Either way, I would splurge a few extra bucks. Buy the stand by itself, get a boar brush if you are trying to save cash, and splurge and extra $10 and get a razor of higher quality. I did the math and if I can get &amp;#34;6 months&amp;#34; out of this purchase, I will break even and can try with a new razor in my quest to save money and have a better shave.</li>
    <li> Merchandise was received in great condition. I enjoyed shaving with this product. Delivery was quick. I would recommend product.</li>
    <li> So far so good. First shave went pretty good didnt have much money to spend but luckily I picked the right one.</li>
    <li> The only negative is that I would&#x27;ve liked to load blade from the top easier. Like just twisting to let the top open, loading blade then twisting back down.  This is not set up that way.  Other than that, perfect.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great product, prompt delivery and everything was packaged and shipped well. The brush makes a great lather and is well balanced in the hand. The razor has a good weight to it and also feels good to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to anyone starting off wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great deal. My husband love the boar brush that came with the set more than the beaver one in the soap kit I bought.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying a DE razor and I have been very satisfied with this product. If you compare what you get with this set to buying everything separately, you basically get a free razor when choosing the Perfecto. To be clear, this is an entry level product but it is great if you are on a budget or just starting out. For me, I had never used a DE razor and was not sure whether I was going to stick with it or not so the price point was very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon unboxing this kit, I was very pleased with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor:&lt;br /&gt;The razor is solid and it has an even blade reveal that doesn&#x27;t seem too aggressive. Just learning, I cut myself several times but that is just operator error when trying to get the feel of a DE razor. The milling on the edges of the razor was not perfectly leveled out but it doesn&#x27;t affect the use of the razor at all. The razor&#x27;s finish is some type of chrome overcoat that has held up well for the first couple of months since I bought it. While I don&#x27;t think it will last a lifetime, I think it will last for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Badger Brush:&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a good entry level brush that has a sort of break in period in which you need to rinse it out well. It also tends to shed a little at times so I&#x27;m looking forward to comparing it to a premium brush when I have a chance to upgrade. Nevertheless, I am very happy with the performance and the above quirks do not affect its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand:&lt;br /&gt;The stand is great quality and was one of the big reasons I went with this set. Buying a stand separately costs more than I was looking to spend so to get it bundled with the razor and brush seemed like a great deal. I do not anticipate every having to buy another razor stand. Not to mention, when you get a DE razor, it looks great to have it displayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone on a budget, just starting out, or looking to give an unusual gift.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product in relation to cost. The stand is excellent and a badger brush is just that, the best!  The razor is the common three piece, unbranded, but provides an excellent shave. Good balance and weight. I&#x27;m happy to have gone back to the future and shave like I did 50 years ago. You can&#x27;t go wrong at this price. Excellent vendor to work with.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, gives a closer shave than most expensive razors. However I had to order two because my first one came incomplete, only with the Brush, but other than that mishap it was pretty good.</li>
