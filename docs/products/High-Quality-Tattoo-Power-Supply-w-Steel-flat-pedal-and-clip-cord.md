### Positive Reviews

      <li>This item is excellent!!</li>
      <li>The power supply already stopped working, the foot pedal is a good travel pedal for any artist on the go.</li>
      <li>Save your money, buy something better!</li>
      <li>gave it 5 stars because at first the power supply wasn&#x27;t working, but the selller is great, and answered within the hour.</li>
      <li>great customer service, thanks for all of the help i appreciate it.</li>
      <li>Would absolutely recommend this power supply, an excellent power supply, I love it and its easy to set up and get ready!</li>
      <li>Works great with a little tattoo kit i ordered from Amazon also, Anyone looking to get into tattooing should consider this power supply</li>
      <li>the noise should be consistent..</li>
      <li>Would cost me more to ship it back to Rice-Flinging China...</li>
      <li>Absolutely a must buy!</li>
      <li>when I first plug it in.</li>
      <li>If you keep in mind that these electronic products are super affordable then one can&#x27;t expect them to last forever.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend for any tattoo artist to get this if your a beginner or even a professional!!</li>
      <li>oh well, I&#x27;ve wasted more on porn than that</li>
      <li>this seems to have fixed the initial short it was having, the sound the machines make after running on this PS have me questioning, they seem to fluctuate in pitch.</li>
      <li>I bought this for a budding tattoo artist and it has served her well for over a year.</li>
      <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth, but yes, in due time some of the parts will start to wear out and not work.</li>
      <li>I use rotary machines and they are very particular about STEADY voltage, you can hear an obvious change in the speed of them after only a short while running...</li>
      <li>It constantly jumped around, and then just quit working completely.</li>

<li> The only complaint i have with it is that it makes a slight high pitch whining noise when plugged in.</li>
<li> It will sometimes overload and shut-down upon initial power on, like completely go dead, not trip any breakers, just go dead from inside itself.</li>
<li> tried this power supply out and it over heats pretty bad, dont know if this is common.</li>
<li> Not sure one this one, the one I received is working</li>
<li> I hate giving this even 1 star very inconsistent power basically it blows.</li>
<li> cuz they was broken</li>
<li> This power supply is horrible!</li>

    <li> This item is excellent!! The slim foot pedal is definitely a convenience!! Works wondfully!!! I would recommend for any tattoo artist to get this if your a beginner or even a professional!!</li>
    <li> Not sure one this one, the one I received is working but it  does some freaky she-et when I first plug it in. It will sometimes overload and shut-down upon initial power on, like completely go dead, not trip any breakers, just go dead from inside itself. this happens after about 5 moves from various or same socket outlet.&lt;br /&gt;I took the thing apart to find a pinched wire this seems to have fixed the initial short it was having, the sound the machines make after running on this PS have me questioning, they seem to fluctuate in pitch. I use rotary machines and they are very particular about STEADY voltage, you can hear an obvious change in the speed of them after only a short while running... I use a on/off toggle switch rather than a pedal with them, so the noise should be consistent.. but it isn&#x27;t...&lt;br /&gt;This PS is only meant to be a back-up, but I do not put a lot of faith into it, but then again it was only 15 bucks....... Would cost me more to ship it back to Rice-Flinging China...&lt;br /&gt;It does work...&lt;br /&gt;It will collect dust as I intended&lt;br /&gt;If it breaks (at 15 bucks ) oh well, I&#x27;ve wasted more on porn than that so whatever.....</li>
    <li> Would absolutely recommend this power supply, an excellent power supply, I love it and its easy to set up and get ready! Absolutely a must buy!</li>
    <li> This item does not work i had two sent them both back cuz they was broken</li>
    <li> tried this power supply out and it over heats pretty bad, dont know if this is common. tried it and its not for me.</li>
    <li> This power supply is horrible! I only used it 3 before it blew out and stopped working. Changed the fuse and it STILL didnt work.</li>
    <li> gave it 5 stars because at first the power supply wasn&#x27;t working, but the selller is great, and answered within the hour. great customer service, thanks for all of the help i appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I hate giving this even 1 star very inconsistent power basically it blows. If this comes in a kit your thinking about buying plan on buying another one.</li>
    <li> Works great with a little tattoo kit i ordered from Amazon also, Anyone looking to get into tattooing should consider this power supply</li>
    <li> Work alright for about a week, volt would move around then settle  eventually. Just stopped working today, stuck at 22 v</li>
    <li> It does its job. The only complaint i have with it is that it makes a slight high pitch whining noise when plugged in.</li>
    <li> its a gift for my niece</li>
    <li> works like a charm. on time no hassel</li>
    <li> The power supply already stopped working, the foot pedal is a good travel pedal for any artist on the go.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a budding tattoo artist and it has served her well for over a year. This is her second one in about 3 years so it doesn&#x27;t hold up well against time but it does work well for about a year. I would recommend this one if you just need to learn how to tattoo or just to practice.</li>
    <li> If you keep in mind that these electronic products are super affordable then one can&#x27;t expect them to last forever.  You get your money&#x27;s worth, but yes, in due time some of the parts will start to wear out and not work.</li>
    <li> please email me at lyricposey@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> i bought this power box and used it once. in the middle of a tattoo it stop working. Hasnt worked since ...</li>
    <li> While it some what worked for a little while, the voltage never stayed steady. It constantly jumped around, and then just quit working completely. Save your money, buy something better! You get what you pay for!</li>
