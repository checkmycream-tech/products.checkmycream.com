      <li>I also decided if I was going to spend the money I wanted something with a bit of class and not a mass produced machine made product, so I opted to search out a nice hand made brush.  </li>

      <li>UPDATE: I have been using the replacement brush everyday for a year and it has worked great!  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic brush.</li>
      <li>Overall I have been happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>So far so good with this one.  </li>
      <li>I am so excited when I use this brush that I intentionally lather 3-4 times \\&quot;just in case I missed something\\</li>
      <li>I was looking for a replacement for an entry level badger brush and decided to find a nice silver tip to see if they live up to the hype.  </li>
      <li>Super soft bristles makes for a luxurious lather and a more comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>He loves it, he says that it&#x27;s a huge step up from even moderately priced brushes and it gives a lovely rich lather.</li>
      <li>Very luxurious lathers and extremely comfortable on the skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush, but only lasted a year before the bristles started falling.</li>
      <li>well worth the price premium to me.</li>
      <li>Once I figured the ratio in the new brush, the lather is amazing, I can easily get enough lather for my 3 passes and one touch up/buffing</li>
      <li>more than enough for 3 passes with this brush.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s pretty conservative.</li>
      <li>brush came with a letter explaining that one should expect the hairs to shed for the first eight weeks.</li>
      <li>softness are all first rate.  </li>
      <li>I assume the first brush which fell apart was just a mfg defect.  </li>
      <li>In my experience, I lost about 1-2 hairs per shave the first 10 shaves and about 1 hair</li>
      <li>But it was shedding hair from the first day.</li>
      <li>Since I love straight razor shaving, I decided to dish out the extra $ for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s very particular about his shaving routine and equipment.</li>
      <li>but you certainly do &amp;#34;want&amp;#34; it.</li>
      <li>Great brush holds lots of water little big for face.</li>
      <li>Has a really plush brush.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;I would really like to have one of those brushes.\\&quot; type of brush.  </li>
      <li>This brush is an absolute pleasure to use and make some of the finest foam I have produced.</li>
      <li>People say that you really can&#x27;t tell the difference between a $60 dollar badger brush and a high end silvertip like this one... trust me...</li>
      <li>I confess that I had issue building a lather the first few days, but that was really due to the fact that this brush can hold so much more water than my old badger brush, I was actually diluting my own lather.  </li>
      <li>I use it with a puck of Mama Bear Soap (which I also highly recommend).</li>
      <li>i highly recomend it.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes and expectations upon receiving the brush.  </li>
      <li>and my shaves are a little better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a really nice brush, yes it is a tad on the expensive side, but you could spend the same or more on an Art Of Shaving brush without the classiness or history.  </li>
      <li>I could easily say I will be a regular customer in the future.  </li>
      <li>Size is just right, not too big and not too stingy.  </li>
      <li>you just want a good silvertip brush and really don&#x27;t care if its traditional styling, handmade or any of those type issues, then there are plenty of really nice silver tip brushes that are a lot less expensive.</li>
      <li>I will update this review after using the new brush for awhile.</li>
      <li>That quality obviously comes with a price which is certainly evident when using the product.</li>
      <li>Already own a smaller brush the BLK4 and like the feel of the Silver Tip however the problem with it was not hair loss but the actual breaking of the center hairs.</li>
      <li>I have bought several hand made combs from Kent, but this was the first brush.  </li>
      <li>However, that&#x27;s when the brush completely separated itself from the handle!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a welcome change from the previous brushes I tried that lost up to a half dozen hairs or so the first few weeks and</li>
      <li>It is definitely a quality brush, I only used it once and got fantastic lather, and enough lather to shave twice.</li>
      <li>I really like the nifty and quality red travel case.  </li>
      <li>Old world craftsmanship and</li>
      <li>havnt lost any hair so far</li>
      <li>I have read accounts from people indicating that it is not unusual for a hair or two to come out when you first use a brush.</li>
      <li>Like the other reviewer, I was looking for a replacement for my old brush, which was also my first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for almost 2 year now and this is my first brush over $50.  </li>
      <li>He says it&#x27;s worth paying extra for and would recommend it as it will last a long time.</li>
      <li>Needless to say I did not take very good care of my old one, so it only lasted a few years for me.</li>
      <li>Expensive but with proper care it will last a long time and provide much more comfortable shave lathers.</li>
      <li>After becoming a wet shave a few year ago, I decide to upgrade the brush that came with my Art of Shaving beginners kit.</li>
      <li>I did not lose a single bristle on the first shave, compared to my first brush which lost at least 2 every time I made a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a beautiful and quality made badger hair brush.  Fits perfectly into the Chrome Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors.  I really like the nifty and quality red travel case.  I have bought several hand made combs from Kent, but this was the first brush.  I could easily say I will be a regular customer in the future.  These are quality hand made products.  Old world craftsmanship and well worth the price premium to me.</li>
    <li> This is a really beautiful brush.  I was looking for a replacement for an entry level badger brush and decided to find a nice silver tip to see if they live up to the hype.  I also decided if I was going to spend the money I wanted something with a bit of class and not a mass produced machine made product, so I opted to search out a nice hand made brush.

IMHO this is not a must have brush, more like a \\&quot;I would really like to have one of those brushes.\\&quot; type of brush.  And if you do receive one as a gift or buy one you will be extremely pleased with it. (still worth popping in your wish list :-), who knows maybe someone else will buy it for you)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want a good silvertip brush and really don&#x27;t care if its traditional styling, handmade or any of those type issues, then there are plenty of really nice silver tip brushes that are a lot less expensive.</li>
    <li> This brush felt great when I started using it. But it was shedding hair from the first day. I was hoping it will stop after a couple of weeks. It still sheds hair every day and is annoying. I have used other badger hair brushes and I have never had this problem.</li>
    <li> Has a really plush brush. Already own a smaller brush the BLK4 and like the feel of the Silver Tip however the problem with it was not hair loss but the actual breaking of the center hairs. Hope that was a manufacturing defect on that brush since I have seen that problem with other reviewers. Or they may not be as hard on the Brush as I am.</li>
    <li> After becoming a wet shave a few year ago, I decide to upgrade the brush that came with my Art of Shaving beginners kit. What a difference! I actually look forward to shaving in the morning. This brush is an absolute pleasure to use and make some of the finest foam I have produced. This along with Feather Brand Blades on a double edge razor will give you one of the closest shaves you will ever experience.</li>
    <li> Makes great lather resulting in a smoother shave.  Size is just right, not too big and not too stingy.  Brush and smooth and comfortable when putting lather on your face.  I have been using a brush for over 20 years.  This is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> Expensive but WELL worth it!  Ultra-soft silvertip badger hair, holds water well and creates perfect lather, even for a beginner.  Go ahead and spend the extra money for it -- this is a long-lasting pleasure.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> Super soft bristles makes for a luxurious lather and a more comfortable shave. I use truefitt and hill shaving cream and just a little lathers more than enough for 3 passes with this brush. Measures about 25mm at the knot for brush stands as well. The case it comes in is a great feature for travel. Expensive but with proper care it will last a long time and provide much more comfortable shave lathers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush, but only lasted a year before the bristles started falling. And yes, this is with proper care.</li>
    <li> Great brush holds lots of water little big for face. Lathers up very nicely a very good quality brush. Bardger hair is very tightly  packed havnt lost any hair so far i highly recomend it.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewer, I was looking for a replacement for my old brush, which was also my first. Needless to say I did not take very good care of my old one, so it only lasted a few years for me. Since I love straight razor shaving, I decided to dish out the extra $ for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come in a very nice case, which I plan on using as a traveling case for the brush since it holds the brush very well.

I did not lose a single bristle on the first shave, compared to my first brush which lost at least 2 every time I made a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good quality brush, this is definitely worth it. Provided you want to spend the money for it.</li>
    <li> I had a less expensive brush that constantly lost badger hairs onto my face. I haven&#x27;t had this problem with this brush, the quality is excellent. That quality obviously comes with a price which is certainly evident when using the product. I wish it wasn&#x27;t as expensive as it was but I am hoping it will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for almost 2 year now and this is my first brush over $50.  Totally glad I purchased it.  I use it with a puck of Mama Bear Soap (which I also highly recommend). After using this brush for about a month, I realized that I&#x27;m getting richer lather than I ever realized I could get and my shaves are a little better.  It feels amazing too.</li>
    <li> This company is the oldest in Britain. The quality is beyond good, it is exceptional. A bit costly but for the man that uses shaving brushes then this is the best of the best.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He&#x27;s very particular about his shaving routine and equipment. He had a silver tip badger brush previously but I wanted to get him the &#x27;best&#x27; one on the market and I believe that it is. He loves it, he says that it&#x27;s a huge step up from even moderately priced brushes and it gives a lovely rich lather. He says it&#x27;s worth paying extra for and would recommend it as it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> The brush feels great on my face. My big problem with the brush is hairs keep falling out each time I use it. I have read accounts from people indicating that it is not unusual for a hair or two to come out when you first use a brush. In my case, two or three have come out each time I use it, and I am going on about fifteen uses of the brush. At this rate, I may end up putting on soap with only a plastic handle.</li>
    <li> This brush is BIG. The description does not do it justice. It has the perfect backbone and the tips are soft as a cloud. Holds a massive amount of lather. Enough for 4 passes and touch up.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush. It is probably more than you \\&quot;need\\&quot; but it feels like heaven on your face. People say that you really can&#x27;t tell the difference between a $60 dollar badger brush and a high end silvertip like this one... trust me... you can. I have recently gotten into the shave crave, and I actually bought a $60 brush. Here&#x27;s what happened: Hairs fell, low water retention, slower lather, and rougher on face. Trust me, there is a difference. Do you NEED that difference? Absolutely not. Do you WANT that difference... Hell yeah! I am so excited when I use this brush that I intentionally lather 3-4 times \\&quot;just in case I missed something\\&quot; The circular motion feels spectacular and the side to side is out of this world... This brush truly caresses your face. If you&#x27;ve got it, GET IT!</li>
    <li> I have been brush shaving for over 30 years and have had a number of brushes over the years.  This is by far the best I have ever had.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but there are also a lot more expensive brushes out there, but it&#x27;s size, it&#x27;s water retention, it&#x27;s softness are all first rate.  I was never a &amp;#34;two pass&amp;#34; shaver before, but I am now, just to be able to run this brush over my face again.  If you want a luxury shave experience, start with this brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it were a tad softer so it would lather more quickly. The lather, however, is rich and dense and very nice. It&#x27;s like comparing the head of an ordinary ale with that of Guinness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush came with a letter explaining that one should expect the hairs to shed for the first eight weeks. That&#x27;s pretty conservative. In my experience, I lost about 1-2 hairs per shave the first 10 shaves and about 1 hair every few shaves the next 10 shaves. I haven&#x27;t lost a single hair the last five weeks. That&#x27;s a welcome change from the previous brushes I tried that lost up to a half dozen hairs or so the first few weeks and a few every shave thereafter (and I stuck with them for months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an expensive brush. If you have a choice between feeding your kids or getting the brush, I&#x27;d say feed your kids. But if your kids are fed, get the brush. The stiff hairs are the only thing keeping me from giving the brush a 5, but this is not enough to keep me from recommending the brush.</li>
    <li> I loved the brush.....worked well, great lather and was very soft to the touch and my face.  Now I know why the Royal Family does bussiness with this company!!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes and expectations upon receiving the brush.  It worked great for about a week.  Very luxurious lathers and extremely comfortable on the skin. However, that&#x27;s when the brush completely separated itself from the handle! Somehow it came unglued.  Not what I expected from this pricey of a brush! However amazon&#x27;s return process couldn&#x27;t have been any easier and they immediately shipped me a replacement brush which was received in two days.  I will update this review after using the new brush for awhile. 8/31/15 UPDATE: Ok, I have been using the replacement brush for about a month. I assume the first brush which fell apart was just a mfg defect.  So far so good with this one.  I love the way it feels on the face.  I find that I spend more time lathering than ever before because it feels so good on the skin.  The result is that I am getting a better lather.  As others have said, you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; a brush this expensive but you certainly do &amp;#34;want&amp;#34; it. 7/14/16 UPDATE: I have been using the replacement brush everyday for a year and it has worked great!  It sheds very little and the brushes have remained extremely soft.  Overall I have been happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had several other (expensive) brushes, but this has been my favorite so far.  It has only lost one hair since I purchased it.</li>
