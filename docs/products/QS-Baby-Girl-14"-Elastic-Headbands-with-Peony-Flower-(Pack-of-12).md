<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same like the one I picked in the picture.</li>
    <li> Although the head bands are as pictured (the colors are exact), however, once I took a closer look, the flowers look cheap.  The flowers are also very big for an infant head.  I ended up trimming them down.  I like the fact that the flowers are removable, but the clip leaves an indentation on my baby&#x27;s head.  For this reason, I&#x27;m going to wait until she&#x27;s a little older to use them and that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> bow were to big for my daughter head :-(</li>
    <li> my daughters look beautiful in these headbands.</li>
    <li> Love these headbands.. They were perfect! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because they took awhile to show up but otherwise they were great!</li>
    <li> These bows are great, the only thing I would mention is that you can&#x27;t move the flower on these they are glued on.  That is good though when you are dealing with babies cause the attachments leave marks on their heads.  If you are an adult though and wanted to mix up the flowers you would not want to order these specifically.  I have found them the other way also.</li>
    <li> Loved this headbands fit my baby girl perfect and they look very pretty on also.</li>
    <li> Their okay not what i expected kinda cheap looking they were clips though.</li>
    <li> Super cute and great deal!</li>
    <li> Flowers are big. Too big for my daughters head.</li>
    <li> Love it, better then expected</li>
    <li> I like them so much I bought them for my baby sisters (twins) I can&#x27;t wait until they are born so I can try them out on them.</li>
    <li> Love them! The flowers are a bit large for a baby but she still wears them and looks adorable.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, vivid colors.</li>
    <li> They are super cute. Only complaint, the flowers did not clip on like described, they are not removable. Other that they are perfect!</li>
    <li> Great quality , very cute colors</li>
    <li> This is a great package deal. Too bad my 12 month old won&#x27;t keep them on her head (she tears them off). However, the flowers are removable (they clip on) and they are pretty cute clipped in the hair without the whole headband. This came straight from China and didn&#x27;t take too long.</li>
    <li> I got these to give as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;The girl I gave them to loved them so much&lt;br /&gt;She is a first time mother.&lt;br /&gt;We loved that it had almost every color needed to match clothes.&lt;br /&gt;We did not get the ones with the flowers that came off, But we loved them all the same :)&lt;br /&gt;The band is thick, the flower is very big, but very cute.</li>
    <li> Came faster then expected!! Loved the many different colors....what you see in the picture is what you get!! Can&#x27;t wait till my little one arrives in a few weeks to try them out :0)</li>
    <li> I read other reviews about similar head bands and decided on these because if I was going to hassle with bulk headbands, I wasn&#x27;t going to spend a bunch of money doing so. I was amazed to find that this product is EXACTLY what they advertise. I even let my one year old son play with one thinking if he couldn&#x27;t destroy it, it could survive a newborn baby girl. Well, I was right, he stretched it to capacity and yanked on the flower and it withstood his grabby little hands. I got this rainbow variety because I planned to let my little girl wear a lot of her brothers hand me downs, and adding a headband and/or flower would let people know she isn&#x27;t a boy. If I could give it ten stars, I would!</li>
    <li> Some of the colors don&#x27;t match perfect, but I loved having so many.</li>
    <li> These are giant! we ordered it for our new born baby thinking it&#x27;s tiny but it is huge! returned it thanks to Amazon&#x27;s amazing return policy.</li>
    <li> These are great! Priced very well and very nice quality. My daughters love them. My 8 month old and 7 year old. Love these! Perfect transaction.</li>
    <li> The product was what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I love it &amp; got it as a gift for someone :)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE THEY FIT PERFECT THESE ARE LARGE FLOWERS SO IF YOU ARE CONCIOUS ABOUT SIZE THEN THESE ARE FOR YOU THE COLORS ARE PRETTY AND YOU GET EVERY COLOR IN THE PICTURE AND THE GREAT PART IS YOU CAN TAKE THE FLOWER OFF AND USE JUST THE HEADBAND OR MATCH WITH ANOTHER COLOR</li>
    <li> Flower s to big but it fit perfectly. .</li>
    <li> Very cute and stretchy. Fits my 5 month old very well.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews I was hesitant to purchase these.  But I&#x27;m so glad I did it anyway!  The flowers are a bit larger than I expected but not outrageously huge.  They&#x27;re super cute and I love how you can mix and match the headband with the removable flower!  The bands did have a bit of an odor to them but I took them out of the bags and let them air out a bit and now they&#x27;re fine.  Would highly recommend for any little girl!</li>
    <li> These are so cheap for a reason- the flowers are poor quality. Jagged edges and bad material. Some don&#x27;t even match the headband they are attached to.</li>
    <li> They need to resend my stuff because didt have the last name is Sarahi Ayala Rodríguez i pay for the things</li>
    <li> These headband and flower set are great.  I love that the headband is soft and doesn&#x27;t squeeze my baby&#x27;s head.  Although the flowers are big, it looked very cute on my baby.  I also love the fact that the flowers  are removable.  Both my 13 year old and I have worn just the flower in our hair.</li>
    <li> These were awesome they arrived over 2 weeks before they were supposed to be here and it was quite a nice surprise they are great quality and flowers came with no flaws at all and best yet they are interchanging!!! I love it!! Flowers are big so if you don&#x27;t want big don&#x27;t buy but in my opinion not too big :) Also came individually wrapped and neatly stacked in the bubble envelope I am beyond pleased!!!</li>
    <li> She looks so adorable in these, and the price was great. I also like that u can enter-change the headbands and flowers its nice.</li>
    <li> They were good, about on part with other headbands that we&#x27;ve purchased for my daughter. I was expecting them to be better, because frankly, they look better in the picture. When the arrived I was a little disappointed because it is not what I was expecting. Now that I&#x27;ve had a little while to get over the initial disappointment I realize that they&#x27;re on par with just about everything else that we&#x27;ve purchased for my daughter. Quality is average. Look is good. Colors are fantastic. Good, not great.</li>
    <li> The package arrived quickly.  The colors were all there and all the flowers had clips so they separated from the headbands, which was more than I was expecting, SCORE!  For the price they look great (for $10 I&#x27;m okay with the occasional glue string or slight fraying on the flowers edge).  There was a slight smell if you stick your noes in it but I&#x27;m sure it will air our quickly.  I&#x27;m very happy with these.</li>
    <li> They came in two days. I absolutely love how they are made and the flower is so big and beautiful. The colors are wonderful I thought I&#x27;d never find a black headband</li>
    <li> These are great! The flowers are not clipped on so my baby girl cannot rip them off and the colors are fantastic! The orange band is darker than the flower (as shown in picture) but that does not bother me. I have received many complements on them from random people and over hear people say. &amp;#34;oh, what a cute bow&amp;#34; while walking around with my baby girl!</li>
    <li> We brought this headbands for a little who has cancer and they are so soft for her head. She loves them!</li>
    <li> The quality of these headbands is pretty great. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the flowers to be quite as large, but I love the variety of colors and you really can&#x27;t beat the price! :)</li>
    <li> recommended 👍 top quality</li>
    <li> The headpieces are amazing!!! I actually wasnt expecting much considering how many came in the set for how cheaply priced they were. I love them and they are adorable! My 3 month old is so little and i figured the would fall right off, but they don&#x27;t. i also love how the flower is detachable so you can use them in different ways. i have actually detached the flower and put it on my 5 year old. Thanks for a high quality product!!!</li>
    <li> The colors are bright very pretty.  Although the flowers are very large, not a bad thing for most people but for me I don&#x27;t want the head band to cover my babys face.  She is 30 inches long and 24 lbs 10 months old and these flowers look big on her head but still cute.  I will use them for pictures.&lt;br /&gt;The flowers are clipped onto the bands so you can take them off and use with a different color band or like me wear a flower yourself.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Flowers are a little to large but it fit my baby&#x27;s head just fine. Her head is in the 1 percentile so it&#x27;s very little and it fit just fine!</li>
    <li> Nice but flowers were glued on so I can&#x27;t mix and match plus one of the center &amp;#34;stones&amp;#34; fell off right after I took it out of the bag. Don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last very long.</li>
    <li> I love them they are so cute. They come by regular mail so you can&#x27;t track it. They are good they don&#x27;t leave marks and are not tight on the my little princess head.</li>
    <li> The headbands are okay. They do not look like the picture and the flowers are huge. The flowers are not clips they are glued on. They did come in pretty colors.</li>
    <li> Love these headbands but I gave a 4 star because they are not clip ons!! However, I Iove the colors, they&#x27;re so beautiful.  I can&#x27;t wait till my lil princess wears them!</li>
    <li> Bows look nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> Good product. Headbands are bright and colorful</li>
    <li> Awesoooooome&lt;br /&gt;I love it&lt;br /&gt;Good price for wonderfull prouduct</li>
    <li> I was hesitant...but the QUALITY OF THESE BOWS ARE EXCELLENT!!!..They arrived fluffy...nit smashed Excellent gift...every color you could ever need.&lt;br /&gt;Price is unbeatable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> These are not clips are stated above, they are glued to the headband. I recieved two orange and two yellow and did not recieve a white or a dark pink. Not happy</li>
    <li> The flowers stunk like fish.. Besides that they looked fine.</li>
    <li> Beautiful for grandbaby</li>
    <li> The flowers are huge!!! And the bands are very wide. But pretty colors, as pictured, and will be so cute on my twin girls&#x27; heads!</li>
    <li> These headbands are very beautiful and came as shown in the picture but the reason i give it a 4 star is because it had a awful smell to it like a dead fish smell def had to soak them in detergent for a while but other than that . beautiful</li>
    <li> The variety pack  is a good value and they are cute. Plus, they look great on the baby. Easy to match with outfits.</li>
    <li> Even though the headbands are a good size for an infant, the flowers are not clip ons. (That is the reason why I bought them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also took a LONG time to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the headbands are nice and comfortable for my 3 month old, but I was disappointed that they were not clip flowers like it was advertised.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hairbows for a little girl.  I thought they were smaller so they are a bit too big for my taste for an infant but I will use them when she is older.  Bright and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Soft and adorable and love all the colors</li>
    <li> The price is great but it should be bought for girls more than a year old. I bought it for my newborn thinking that the flowers were attached to the headband by glue or small click but instead it has a clip that is used in hair salons. But besides that it is cute and all the color shown were what i got!</li>
    <li> The colors are fantastic and quality seems good.  I bought these for an infant and I feel the clips will need to be sewn on or glued on.  The infant may pull at the bow and with the metal clip I FEEL could scratch the baby.  I recommend this product and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought the clips would come off to make them all interchangeable but they dont. It&#x27;s okay they are adorable though.</li>
    <li> Perfect. They are very stretchy to fit baby infant through adult without being tight.</li>
    <li> These are very cute HOWEVER they are HUGE!!!  Only now that my daughter is 4 months do they look like they are somewhat proportional.  Wish they made the exact same thing with a smaller flower!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my package. I waited a whole month and it was finally here! I opened it to find that the flowers were a little bigger than I anticipated and the colors were slightly off from what was pictured which was fine. I did however become upset when I noticed I didn’t receive all the colors I had expected and even received 2 of the same color. The BLACK headband is the reason for the purchase and it wasn’t even in there!! Instead I have multiple off white headbands. I’m NOT a happy camper!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these! They are worth the money!</li>
    <li> The quality was absolutely wonderful! They were on sale and I felt as if I was getting a steal! Very grateful for this product, thank you!</li>
    <li> I really like these headbands. They fit my 5 month old great and the material will allow her to grow into them. The flowers are clipped on so you can put different colored flowers on the different colored bands if you want. I was worried because the flowers are attached with a big metal clip but it doesn&#x27;t bother my daughter at all or push to hard on her head. Shipping takes awhile but I still got these before the estimated date. Great product.</li>
    <li> Love this set the price was great shipping was awesome received order faster then expected. Looks so much better in person great quality</li>
    <li> These headbands are perfect she can wear them for a while :)&lt;br /&gt;Love all the colors and the shipping just took two weeks :)</li>
    <li> These are advertised that they are headbands with detachable flowers for mixing and matching. However this is not the case. My pack came with the flowers, which are of cheesy quality in my opinion, hot glued to the headbands already. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase, because at one point, based upon the reviews, they sounded like they were sold and sent as advertised.</li>
    <li> Every single Headbands are so cute :)</li>
    <li> I did not get the correct product......the flowers on the headband are not removable and I contacted the seller and got no response.......product cannot be used for what it was purchased for.......I want my money back but doubt that I will get it seeing as though nobody has responded  to me......the name of the product clearly states that they are clips.....I do see that the price has gone down so the product may have changed but I paid 11 dollars and some change which I would think means that I paid for the flowers to be actual clips.....if the product was changed the name should not say peony clip</li>
    <li> These headbands are pretty cute and don&#x27;t seem to bother my daughter. They are as pictured and the colors are nice and vibrant.. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about them is that they are not flower clips with seperate headbands. The flowers are glued onto the headbands. I can&#x27;t really be mad at the company for this because it does match their description but I was going off the descriptions people left in their reviews. People kept talking about how great it was that the flowers are clips and they could mix and match them so I thought that&#x27;s what I was getting. Either people keep reviewing the wrong item on here or the seller changed the item. I just got them so I can&#x27;t really comment on their durability. And yes, they take awhile to ship but they let you know that when you buy them so no complaints there. I actually got mine earlier than the estimated shipping date.</li>
    <li> Great seller loved them!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Very cute. All three of my granddaughters like to wear them (especially for presenting plays, competing in talent shows, and going with Mom and Dad to fancy places.</li>
    <li> took forever to come, but they work fine.</li>
    <li> Nice headbands, pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> I loved it !! It s looking beautiful. Worth the penny spent..</li>
    <li> I love these headbands, they look  prettier in person. I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love them , it took a while to get here but it was worth the wait ❤❤</li>
    <li> Great item. This item is very popular in 2014. Amazon always have great items and cheap prices.</li>
    <li> Flowers are nice and big. Every flower was intact and there was no smell like others had stated. I got all colors except a cream I end up getting two whites instead but it&#x27;s okay because white gets dirty easily</li>
    <li> Great quality...flowers were bigger than I expected but still beautiful and get compliments everywhere we go.</li>
    <li> Great assortment of colors for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Loved them, great quality, great price!</li>
    <li> Not bad but they had a funny smell to them!</li>
    <li> They came in before the estimated time and look great. But The flower is glued onto the band though. I though they were interchangeable.  But still good for the price.</li>
    <li> Super cute and at a great price!! Love that I have many colors to choose from in the package!</li>
    <li> Everything is as pictured.  The one thing I didn&#x27;t like about this set is that the flowers are hot glued to the bands, you can&#x27;t mix and match the flower and band colors yourself.  (I had purchased a similar set last year that were clip-on-flowers, much better option for us.)</li>
    <li> love these. all different colors and the flowers are clips that you can take off, put onto a different colored headband, mix and match, or simply clip into hair when little girls out grow that bands.</li>
    <li> They took a while to get here but when they arrived they were perfect.clip on flowers on the headband.the flowers are big but I love them .my daughter will stand out 👍</li>
    <li> Received product 2 weeks and 2 days after order was placed. Wasn&#x27;t aware that I would need to be home when these were delivered and sign for them and had to get them from the post office. Flowers and headbands are not interchangeable. Flowers are glued onto headbands. Doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I still love the headbands. Gems are centered in all flowers and all pieces are in excellent condition. Colors are nice and vibrant. All 12 were in package as well.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! However, the metal clips are jagged and are uncomfortable. I wrapped cotton around them to avoid red indentions in baby&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL!!! Worth the buy!!!</li>
    <li> These are nice and comes in a lot of colors for whatever outfit you put on baby. The headbands are pretty fits great but the the flowers on them couldve been a little smaller. But overall these are cute.</li>
    <li> I really love these headbands and they look great on my daughter. However I ordered these because all the reviews said the flowers can be taken off the headbands and used alone because my daughter will not keep headbands on. When I got these in the mail I was going to take the flowers off the headbands and put them onto my daughters bow holders, but the bows are glued to the headbands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can still use these headbands every now and then. It is just hard to keep a headband on my daughter. She prefers clips.</li>
    <li> Great colors but the items did not come as described. The flowers are shown on clips and to be interchangeable between headbands, which was the selling point for me. The headbands I received had the flowers glued on to the headband instead. I&#x27;m very unhappy about that!</li>
    <li> Great headbands!!!! I purchased these headbands for my newborn and they are perfect! I just couldn&#x27;t take one more person calling her a little boy, lol!  The flower is kind of big so beware, they look great even on a newborn :-).</li>
    <li> I love these headbands they fit perfectly and very pretty!</li>
    <li> The flowers were a bit bigger than I expected them to be.  But the headbands still look really cute on my baby.  And she actually keeps them on her head, so they must be pretty comfortable.</li>
    <li> These are super cute, and I was looking forward to using them as headbands and then clip flowers later, but they have a very pointy clip!!!! I was afraid to put them on a newborn so they haven&#x27;t been used yet. If the clips were rounded instead of pointy, it would fix the issue.</li>
    <li> I bought this Headbands for my Baby - and is so Adorable!!</li>
    <li> The band&#x27;s whr good but the flowers on the band I didn&#x27;t like.an it didn&#x27;t come on time.very unhappy wit the my purchase.</li>
    <li> My purchased arrived a lot earlier that it said it would. The flowers are bigger than they are pictured, but I think that worked out even better! Great quality product.</li>
    <li> The headbands are very pretty they fit a newborn head but the flower on the headband is huge and over powers the head but if you like that sort of thing you&#x27;ll be fine she probably won&#x27;t wear hers until six months. When her head looks big enough and the bow doesn&#x27;t look silly</li>
    <li> Ordered these expecting I would be able to un-attach the flower from the headband but when I received them the flower was glued to the headband. Still very nice but not accurate to the pictures that are displayed.</li>
    <li> Received on time...they are BEAUTIFUL! I get tons of compliments when my baby wears them! She is 7 months old but has a pretty big head and they fit WAY better than the stores :-)</li>
    <li> Love the variety of color in this package and the fact that they&#x27;re clip-ons so you can swap bows and bands around. The flowers are not small! they are actually a little big but my daughter still has her &amp;#34;preemie&amp;#34; head shape which will round out and I think these hair bands will be able to grow with her bc of the elasticity. Very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> Love the headbands, they are exactly what i was expecting. The little metal clip does stick out a bit, but all you have to do it position it just right in the headband and put on baby&#x27;s head. I like that I can mix and match the headbands and flowers to match outfits. The flowers aren&#x27;t too big either. Shipping was way quicker than expected. All in all I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Pretty headbands. I added felt to the back I was a little uncomfortable with the metal clip being on my newborns head.</li>
    <li> Headbands are stretchy so they fit multiple sizes and will last for several years.  My granddaughter will never have to worry about not having a bow to match her outfit.  LOL</li>
    <li> The headbands are okay for the price, they look kind of cheap. I love the colors they are very pretty and they will fit a newborns head.</li>
    <li> These are cute but the colors are not as bright as pictured. Also, love the fact that you can take the flowers off and switch them around.</li>
    <li> The flower on these is huge-looks funny on my 9 month old granddaughter&#x27;s tiny head!  They are bright and pretty, just wish the flower was half the size!</li>
    <li> not to tight and i love that the flowers can come off to be mixed and matched accordint to her outfit. ive recommeded them to friends!</li>
    <li> Super, super cute headbands.&lt;br /&gt;My daughters love them. They especially love the fact that you can remove the flowers and add any hair bow/clip to it that you want.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> they are cute, the flowers are huge but that&#x27;s clearly stated. the problem i had was all the reviews said that you could take the flower off if you wanted to and switch with different headbands or wear just a headband or flower.. what i got was flowers super glued to headbands.. I&#x27;m disappointed i can&#x27;t switch them or remove them</li>
    <li> Love that there&#x27;s a black in here and looks good on</li>
    <li> Very cute, nice colors well made. Tempted to buy more, the flowers are bigger than they appear in picture, which is a plus!</li>
    <li> The flower is too big which i don&#x27;t like, but I gave 3 bcoz the band fits my baby pretty well.</li>
    <li> Much bigger than expected but beutiful ,is a good combinations of colors. I did not read the dimmensions And that is my mistake but not bad at all.</li>
    <li> Pros: Headbands individually and neatly packaged, flowers are on clips and can be worn without headband or switched around, beautiful quality my daughter always gets complements, flowers are big (if you like that), received all colors pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The metal clips on the flowers aren&#x27;t covered with fabric so they show if not positioned correctly. Crochet headbands and velcro bibs do NOT go well together, the velcro will catch and make loops on the headband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall we love them! We mainly use them for special occasions because of the flower size, but you could use them with every day outfits too. They have fit our daughter since she was 2 months, her head circumference was 39cm. She is now 4 months and still wears them, they are holding up well!</li>
    <li> The headbands are well made and the colors are beautiful.  They are very soft and give enough so there is no mark left on babys head.</li>
    <li> from reading comments, I thought flowers should be on clips so that you can mix and match. This was the reason why we chose to buy. Also some even mentioned it was individual wrapped but the package i received all in one plastic bag. Flowers are all glued on the bands. It is very poorly glued and attached and the color of some flowers are faded unevenly.  i am not a picky shopper but truly unhappy if i received something not as advertised.</li>
    <li> I am soo happy that I bought these.  The variety of color matches all of my baby&#x27;s outfits.  So fare Q&#x27;s have not failed me in the headband department.  My baby girl has a wide range of hair accesories due to Q&#x27;s.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. I was concern if it was going to get here in time for my event. I arrived the week of and that saved me a lot of stress. The band is on the larger side but I have no complaints outside of that.</li>
    <li> 1. I received a very dirty product. Glue everywhere!!!&lt;br /&gt;2. 2 yellow bands - 2 oranges bands // No fuchsia - No white&lt;br /&gt;3. No clips&lt;br /&gt;I think a bought a really fake product. I want to send this product back. I feel stolen!!!</li>
    <li> bands are nice but the flower is a bit static and is not very good ..</li>
    <li> These are very cute and perfect when in dressing up my baby girl. Be warned though, these flowers are HUGE!</li>
    <li> Flowers were not seperate as described but arrived looking as expected. However flowers are big... too big for my baby head.</li>
    <li> The the price, these are great to have.  However, they begin to unravel as your baby pulls on the headband often.</li>
    <li> Flowers were glued directly onto the headbands. There were no clips as described.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL...CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THEM ON MY GRANDDAUGHTER &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied !!!-.- some of the flowers had glue everywhere !! And they were NOT clips as I read on some of the comments. The colors are as in the picture.  But I&#x27;m still not satisfied -.-  wouldn&#x27;t buy them again ! 1 star because of the glue and not clips.  dissapoonted !</li>
    <li> These are AWESOME for our 4 month old daughter.  They fit great, and the flower is huge which in my opinion makes her look adorable.</li>
    <li> Cheap flower clips. Not as pictured.</li>
    <li> Flowers was bigger than I thought but it was ok... Took long to ship though!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair bows I love them and so dose my little one. They are very stretchy so they will fit her for a good while and they don&#x27;t leave marks on her head. They only bad thing is hey took a while to get here but there from China and I&#x27;m in Arizona so very far haha all in all great bows and great price 😍💛🎀</li>
    <li> These are cute, but missing colors. Got duplicates</li>
    <li> loveeee loveeeee loveeeeeee!</li>
    <li> I love this product, my baby girl  looks so Beautiful</li>
    <li> Flower is too big. Metal clip can hurt delicate skin.</li>
    <li> Adorable on my 4 month old. I can tell these ill still fit even when she is older too. Good quality and I get a lot of compliments on it!</li>
    <li> These flowers were not what I expected. They had an aweful smell to them. Just not happy with this item. Flowers look nothing like the flowers pictured on the site.</li>
    <li> Super cute! And huge which is the fashion statement. Not too loose not too tight just perfect!</li>
    <li> Perfect accessory for a baby girl the flowers are clips and look great interchanged with different color headbands... baby will love the headband because its comfy and mom will he happy</li>
    <li> Shipping a bit long but great product</li>
    <li> So cute. They fit perfect. Bought them for my new born.</li>
    <li> Some we&#x27;re damaged some look cheap</li>
    <li> Flowers don&#x27;t come off like in description</li>
    <li> I love the stretchy comfy headband. The flowers are bigger than baby&#x27;s head and I wish I could remove them.</li>
    <li> this is not what I thought it would be. the picture I saw was the flower with a clip on the back coming separate from the headband. I was thinking I would get two separate parts, the flower and the headband. not the case. they are cute and my daughter look adorable in them. they are big in the size of the flower its a bit smaller than my hand. I was just disappointed because the picture showed something different than what I got as far at the two parts. other than that all the colors were what the looked like in the picture and they fit my 3 month old perfect and will fit probably well into her toddler years. the only reason I was dissatisfied is because of the faulty picture showing the flower coming off the head band.</li>
