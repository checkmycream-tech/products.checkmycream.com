      <li>Hi,  I&#x27;d like to buy this mirror if it will fit on my wall -- I have only 2 \\&quot; in width available for the wall-mount.  </li>

      <li>Based on previous reviews, I was expecting a more sturdy product.  </li>
      <li>This mirror looks okay, but is wobbly and after flipping over a few times tightens up where you have to keep adjusting the screws.  </li>
      <li>but it blocked the light from my pendant light behind it.  </li>
      <li>In order to clear the shelf</li>
      <li>I almost bought a nearly identical mirror at Lowes for twice the price.</li>
      <li>All-in-all a good value for the casual user.  </li>
      <li>The only disadvantage of this particular model is that the arm is short and does not extend very far.</li>
      <li>I selected it for its smaller size and am pleased that it takes just a small amount of room and folds flat against the wall.</li>

<li> I wanted a small make up mirror</li>
<li> nothing wrong with the product</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great mirror. Installed easily. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror.  Good magnification.  Solid construction.  My only change would allow vertical adjustability to allow flexibility in positioning on the wall.  I had to move a picture to position it at the correct height.</li>
    <li> This is a top quality product.  The mirror is the clearest I have seen.  The frame is heavy and has a quality feel to it.  The only disadvantage of this particular model is that the arm is short and does not extend very far.</li>
    <li> Yes, indeed, this mirror does extend from the wall.  I would recommend butterfly toggle mounting bolts that can be purchased at your local hardware store instead of the plastic sink mounts that come with the kit, though.  Could be just me, but I&#x27;ve never had much luck using those successfully and this time was no exception.  Aside from the mounting, I&#x27;m quite happy with the functionality of the mirror.  No more back strain while leaning over to put on eye makeup!  It does extend only 12\\&quot; from the wall, so don&#x27;t expect the mirror to extend so far that you might not have to angle in toward the wall a little bit.  I definitely recommend this product for it&#x27;s functionality and stylish look.</li>
    <li> Hi,  I&#x27;d like to buy this mirror if it will fit on my wall -- I have only 2 \\&quot; in width available for the wall-mount.  I did not see any dimensions for the width of the mounting panel.  So could someone please tell me how wide the vertical mount (plate) is?  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> One of the best buys out there.  I paid $20. Hope to buy another one if it comes back on sale for $20.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product.  Looks good, works great, feels very solid, and at a fair price.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  Getting it was my idea after using them many times in hotels when traveling on business but now that we have it in our bathroom my wife loves it even more than I do.</li>
    <li> I saw a 3X one in a hotel and looked it up online and bought the 5X one, I&#x27;m glad I got the 5X.  I&#x27;d be interested to see what the 10X one is like, but it may be &#x27;too much&#x27;.  It is really nice to use to find &#x27;missed hairs&#x27; and whatever blemishes one wants to look for!  My wife and daughter really like it!</li>
    <li> I wanted a small make up mirror that I also use to see the back of my head to check my hair.  This one was inexpensive and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This mirror provides the right amount of magnification for makeup, etc. I selected it for its smaller size and am pleased that it takes just a small amount of room and folds flat against the wall. It was easy to install and is well made.</li>
    <li> My husband loves going to hotels due to the mirrors in the bathrooms.  I found this product that happens to be the same product used in hotels.  I installed it in minutes.  It was a great Father&#x27;s Day present.</li>
    <li> Ever get a hole in the back of your head and need to see how to fix it? How about that unruly hair in your chin that needs to be removed? This mirror is great for both.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  I hung it near a bright window and use it daily.  It is perfect for what I need.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving in the shower. Mounted on tiled shower wall with silicone glue and can now shave in the shower. With adjustment the mirror can be moved away from water and my face remains visible while shaving. Since I do not have to hold the mirror there is less chance of dropping my razor. This appears to be of good quality and hopefully will not rust. Watch for updates after use for a few months.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice &#x27;n classy. All fixtures included for attachment to the wall. Clean, clear and crisp reflection. No funny glass problems, even distributed glass and coating. Also has a plain mirror at the back.</li>
    <li> A good buy for the price and works great in our small bathroom.  If I had a larger bathroom I would have purchased a larger one.</li>
    <li> This mirror looks okay, but is wobbly and after flipping over a few times tightens up where you have to keep adjusting the screws.  I have a similar (more expensive) mirror that I use several times a day and never have the not-able-to-flip because it&#x27;s too tight problem.  I&#x27;m returning it and looking for a higher quality mirror,</li>
    <li> This was a nice product, but I had to return it because it wouldn&#x27;t fit, height wise, in the space I had due to a conflict with a glass shelf previously installed.  In order to clear the shelf It was about 3 inches too tall, which doesn&#x27;t sound like much but it blocked the light from my pendant light behind it.  It could have worked if I mounted it upside down but I didn&#x27;t think it would look good that way.</li>
    <li> not what I expected. nothing wrong with the product, I needed it bigger round, it was to small for what I was using it for.Other wise it was ok.</li>
    <li> the mirror is wonderful.  just wish it had a longer extention arm. &lt;br /&gt;delmer</li>
    <li> Based on previous reviews, I was expecting a more sturdy product.  The screws holding the swivel between 5x and 1x position, and the arm adjustments come loose after only a few movements. Clarity of the mirror is OK.  Easy to install. All-in-all a good value for the casual user.  For heavier use, you&#x27;d want to purchase a professional-grade which would cost 3 times more.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Easy to mount with right hardware.</li>
    <li> The arm is a bit short, have to stretch to see anything.</li>
    <li> I almost bought a nearly identical mirror at Lowes for twice the price. So glad I found this. Great deal on a great product.</li>
    <li> The arm was a bit shorter than I envisioned, so isn&#x27;t quite as versatile, but overall I like the way it looks and functions</li>
