<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great fragrance, just doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
    <li> Fat shipper exactly what I needed thank you will buy again from</li>
    <li> i really like it and the women do too.</li>
    <li> Prefer the lighter one of the same brand.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!!!.....what else...ok&lt;br /&gt;1) Amazon delivered it super fast, even status was &amp;#34;need extra time for sourcing&amp;#34;.....thumbs up Amazon&lt;br /&gt;2) Please do not think &amp;#34;if price is low, product will be of low quality&amp;#34;. This perfume is under valued compare to his quality.&lt;br /&gt;3) It is not super strong, but also not mild, it is average.....yes, i don&#x27;t want people should hold there breath while taking to me....&lt;br /&gt;4) Like is OK, it goes for around 5 hours easily.&lt;br /&gt;5) The most important: As perfume formulation is an ART, then applying this ART is also an ART. Apply it correctly(please Google it) and apply right amount too.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be an extraordinary scent to have but unfortunately it is much more of a young mans scent...</li>
    <li> Stumbled on this while surfing Amazon and so happy I did!  It&#x27;s unique and masculine with a scent that makes a statement without being obnoxious. I have been using it daily for two weeks and get compliments all the time.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> old dude turns on young chick.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it was at a doctors appointment. As I sign in at the receptionists window, the young lady working there greeted me with, &amp;#34;wow! Do you smell good.</li>
    <li> Smells alright. I was expecting the fragrance to be a darker version of the original Thallium, however i did not find the scent to be reminiscent of the original at all. Not a terrible fragrance, just not what was expected. The recipient seemed to like it though.</li>
    <li> I have many designer, classic, and expensive (&gt;$80 per ounce) niche fragrances and Thallium Black (not necessarily the others in this line) ranks ahead of many of them. I often blind test newly purchased scents on my friends and family by wearing a few of the best at the same time. This scent is always liked among them. As an eau de toilette it may not have the longevity of the more expensive parfums but it is a warm, spicy, clean sleeper scent worth much more than the online prices. It also can be worn in any season and is often my go-to scent. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It was a gift...I was tokd it smells Great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok... Smells like something an old man from Mississippi would wear lol my gf hates it..</li>
    <li> Smells really awesome and the smell lasts on for roughly 12 hours</li>
    <li> Great! And lasts days! I sprayed it on my pajamas 3 days ago, and they still smell like this cologne now! Buy it!</li>
    <li> Not strong and doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 hours</li>
    <li> Smells great, I get compliments constantly and it last long.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good. I have other perfumes from Thallium, but this one stands out. This one is a little formal and goes very well in the evening parties and get-togethers.</li>
    <li> Very Masculine In A Distinct Way. I Love The Feel Of Being In Control Of What People Think Of You</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne it lasts long on my body.</li>
    <li> My woman loves it on me</li>
    <li> Did not know what to expect but when i receive the product is was amazing great smell great feeling</li>
    <li> Not bad, not great though. Doesn&#x27;t last long at all with my body chemistry. It reminds me of one of those knock offs you buy at the dime stores.</li>
    <li> It reminds me of Drakka Noir.&lt;br /&gt;It smells old school but not in a good or a classic way.&lt;br /&gt;I asked a girl about the smell and said &#x27;it&#x27;s a typical guy cologne&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I would wear it more often but this heavy yet empty smell mixes my stomach up.</li>
    <li> Smells like a much more expensive cologne, except at a great price. Smells somewhat like one of the Polo&#x27;s at first, but then it grows on you and now it doesn&#x27;t smell like Polo to me at all . Has a sweeter smell .</li>
    <li> Just how a man should smell, come fall. Plumb and musk is the first thing you smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Longevity is in beast mode ( 8-10 hrs on 2 sprays)&lt;br /&gt;- Projects about a foot&lt;br /&gt;- Awesome bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Wish they had a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> I have had several inquires about this product . I like it because it last all day and it isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
    <li> my son used it more than i did, strong, lasting and afordable Istill have some left and am enjoying it</li>
    <li> Great scent. The only issue is that it seems to fade rather quickly.</li>
    <li> This smells pretty good. Although I ordered it based on reviews that I read about it I must say it has a pretty smooth scent. You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> It is even better than I expected! Thanks!</li>
    <li> will definitely be buy more of it. it&#x27;s my new scent  and people around me love it as mucjh as i do</li>
    <li> Great product perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this out of a whim wondering whether I just wasted my money. But I can say that I was quite impressed. It gives off that masculine scent and the minute you put it on, you really feel like a man. I could smell it on my clothes 2 days later even though I sprayed it on my skin before I put on my shirt. The base notes give the impression of a woody deep sound (I know, that&#x27;s not quite descriptive), a grave sounding trombone. Did I mention the Price? You can&#x27;t ask for better than that.</li>
    <li> My OL  doesnt like it but i think it smells great. It kind of reminds me of diesel fragrance (white and red bottle). People have said it is a great evening cologne i wear it all day and im happy.</li>
    <li> Item was received much sooner than anticipated.  The cologne is brilliant and I have already received quite a few compliments.</li>
    <li> The scent is very pleasant and  lasts all day. Much more reasonably priced than colognes offered in department stores. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great sent got a bottle for my dad and myself</li>
    <li> I got this because I went to visit my boyfriend and he was wearing it so I wanted to have it to smell like him but I don&#x27;t like it that much anymore so I just have it to give it to him if he wants it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an okay smell. Depends on your preference.</li>
    <li> It wasnt my favorite. Doesnt last long neither. I will never buy this again. It&#x27;s still on my table, never used again.</li>
    <li> Love this new find.  I was looking to change out my old scent for something new.  I was feeling daring and decided to try this scent after reading some other reviews.  The price was right also.  Very satisfied with the choice and got lots of complements from the fragrance.  Scent lasts surprising long !  I will most likely buy this product again, and from this seller.  Arrived quickly and as expected.!</li>
    <li> Thallium Black smells great to me.  I instantly fell in love with the fragrance, It&#x27;s kind of sweet, with spice, and woody notes, so definitely more of a darker fragrance.  I&#x27;ve never been great with over the top descriptions of cologne, but it&#x27;s great, I&#x27;d bathe in it if I could lol.  If you like scents along the line of Spicebomb by Viktor&amp;Rolf, give this a go. Only complaints are that it lasts maybe about four hours, and the sillage isn&#x27;t great, maybe a few inches from the skin.</li>
    <li> This is by now my favourite perfume. I have not tried many tough but this one has a good smell and it lasts on me for hours(5hours+ for sure). The smell can be smelled from close to medium range I would say not very far like 3-5meters I would say. It came good packeged. The bottle looks nice. The smell is not very strong but is good enough in my oppinion.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells very manly and seems to last for hours.  Far better than other colognes I&#x27;ve gotten that are five times the price.  Have already received many compliments so I will be reordering this product when I run out.  Great budget cologne without sacrificing quality.</li>
    <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long, but I really like it regardless of this. Someone let me know if you&#x27;ve found something similar that lasts long?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been hugged without my scent being noted. Usually it&#x27;s verbal, and sometimes the look in their eyes show it. The warm fragrance in Thallium Black will draw in people, and attract attention - the good kind, not the head-turning from 10 feet away kind. This is a cologne that will compliment any gentleman, and will ensure that when someone gets close, they stay there longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undoubtedly, everyone has a scent. That being said, it is worth trying to find out if this is yours. Personally, i feel that this is what my natural pheromone would be if I didnt eat so many hot pockets. I&#x27;m lucky in that the women around me love this stuff, and it&#x27;s cheap enough I&#x27;d drink it if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, if you&#x27;re a normal person you have no clue what this smells like because have no idea what warm smells like, nor earthy, nor what any of the ingredients or whatever are doing in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The best advice is to dole out the $17(?), get some great cologne, and if you don&#x27;t like it, then at least you&#x27;ll know what a warm, earthy scent is.</li>
    <li> It sure is worth the money. Not bad for the price. I wear it daily. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I like that perfume, I alway buy to sell.  My clients love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome perfume people are asking me what i am wearing</li>
    <li> thats the question i got asked the first day i wore this colonge. I gave this 5 stars because this is a great scent.  Subtle yet present. this definetly exude a confident sexy swagg.  I wouldn&#x27;t rock this everyday but it&#x27;s great for evenings and weekends. Has a sweet savory kind of smell. Just the right balance, maybe a little more sweet than woody but it&#x27;s a keeper..Priced incredible...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. Definitely not an generic smelling cologne...but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good either. My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like it very much, she says it smells like a metallic scent.</li>
    <li> Just received and love at. Steal for the money and yet very sexy masculine fragrance that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the original,and I am not impressed with it, even though some would say it is good.&lt;br /&gt;Thallium black s the way to go for evening and night adventures.</li>
    <li> Just as the previous reviews said, this cologne is great! Very rich notes and it lasts many hours. I prefer this for the colder months or as a evening cologne.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I bought this for the price and found that I really enjoy the smell...quite nice and lasting throughout the day.  It is subtle without drifting away during the day and I certainly will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the scent, very subtle with no alcohol smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because you can&#x27;t easily transport the bottle. There is no locking mechanism for the sprayer.</li>
    <li> Awesome. smells so good.</li>
    <li> I am no fragrance connoisseur, but I can tell you that, of all the perfumes or colognes I&#x27;ve bought, this is the best by far.</li>
    <li> A really spicy nice evening cologne</li>
    <li> This fragrance is pure Class....It say&#x27;s masculine..  all the way...definitely for the alpha-male...perfect for a business lunch,  board meeting..or letting the opposite sex get a whiff of CONFIDENCE  in a bottle.</li>
    <li> can wear this awesome cologne daily and it smells great and is not overpowering. Perfect and I dont normally like colognes.</li>
    <li> Bought it because of the good reviews.  As soon as I opened it up I knew instantly I was not going to like this one.  Cloyingly sweet and very synthetic in smell.  Just reminded me of a cheap cologne every step of the way.  I&#x27;ve offered it up to a few friends but no one seems to want this.  I&#x27;d avoid this one, even at a low price point.  Perry Ellis colognes are just as cheap and so much nicer in that price point.</li>
    <li> Great smell. I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this perfume very much.</li>
    <li> Husband and I love the scent.  It was a great gift and I enjoyed purchasing the Thallium trio (sport, classic and black) so that he has options depending on gym, work or night out.</li>
    <li> From the reviews it seemed like it will smell great but it doesnt its allright. It&#x27;s a little bit to musky for me.</li>
    <li> This is a very rich, older, confident scent, I don&#x27;t think some youngster could rock this. Outlasts the plaid bottle (Brit) and is well below in price. Very concentrated, so one spritz is all you should apply.</li>
    <li> This stuff is insanely strong. It smells amazing, but one spray is more than enough to last for the entire day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  It&#x27;s kind of hard to buy cologne blindly online from the reviews.  I would say the smell is pleasant, but not overly strong and does not last very long.  I&#x27;ve smelled other colognes and hated them.  Not the case with this.  Really nice bottle...&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase it again?  Probably not.</li>
    <li> All the women comment. They love it on me.</li>
    <li> everything went well no Gremblins</li>
    <li> Its good, but a bit strong for my liking. I LOVE the original Thallium. Nothing can compare.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! Smell lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Smells good.  My son likes this, he has all of them  now and the price was really good. Will by again</li>
    <li> Nice cologne . Not the best I have used like someone said , but okay. Lasts like half a day. Must admit the fragrance is unusual in a nice way. Great for the daytime.</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t tried it out in public but it smells nice and you can&#x27;t beat the price, hopefully my coworkers agree.</li>
    <li> Amazing all star product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product stands above all the many high end / high priced perfumes in the market,&lt;br /&gt;all you need is a very minimal quantity on your body to have nice fragrance all day .....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High end classy perfume for unbelievable price !! that is what this is .... no supermodels no flashy commercials..just plain performance !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried black and blue ...and I like both.</li>
    <li> I just want to let people know that I am a novice when it comes to evaluating \\&quot;frags\\&quot; and just bear with me on this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This frag is THE hidden gem among the cheap colognes, it has been compared to the niche fragrances.  I would wear this over Armani, CK, or BVLGARI because it will set you apart from anyone else and it has similar characteristics to particular niche frags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose behind this is Jeaques Evard (of Paris Bleu- Yves de Sistelle line of frags) and his creation is described as \\&quot;...exquisitely warm and deeply spiced, this rich blend is a web of earth delights.  Masculinity becomes fragrance.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent Pyramid-&lt;br /&gt;Top:  Cardamon, Apple, Bergamot, Nutmeg, Basil, and Sage&lt;br /&gt;Middle: Geranium, Plum, Amber, and Patchouli&lt;br /&gt;Bottom: Tonka Bean and Musk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This frag is potent and will try to knock out anyone.  One spritz will last 10-14 hours.  It is borderline overpowering (which is a drawback for me) but can be tamed.  On my skin, the top notes I noticed the spices (Basil and Sage with a little Nutmeg) with Apple and Cardamon.  After 1-2 hours, the Patchouli and Geranium come out in force with Plum and Amber sweetening the scent on my skin.  Finally, Musk and moderate Tonka Bean shows up for the finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sillage: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;Projection: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Scent: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Overall Rating: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice:&lt;br /&gt;-This is a spicy wood (with fruit) frag for evenings or Fall/Winter seasons&lt;br /&gt;-One spritz to spread on arms and chest is enough (similar to Bond #9, use with caution!!)&lt;br /&gt;-I wore this to work once and got complimented by the ladies, but the scent was overpowering to my coworkers&lt;br /&gt;-This frag is not for the faint of heart because it demands everyone&#x27;s attention</li>
    <li> This fragrances will have you in ahwwwwwwww, no need to buy Tom Fords Noir De Noir this great masculine scent will leave you to come back and buy another one. And No disrespect to the ladies but this cologne is most deff!! what the cologne social medial call it these day and age a real panty dropper. You might want to get this cologne now before you can&#x27;t find it and the price becomes in the 100 dollar range. So go out and buy at least 3 bottles of this.</li>
    <li> Worst men&#x27;s cologne I ever owned.  Carries a very strong odor of cigarettes smoke. I used it once and plan to not ever touch it again.</li>
    <li> Love this item beefing using this for a few years now and it&#x27;s great price for an awesome smell!</li>
    <li> Super good smelling stuff.  It&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> this scent smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it lasts all day long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to perspire frequently..with this cologne I still smell fresh</li>
    <li> I have to apologize to those giving &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; reviews to this product but this is just as bad or worst than the colognes I used to wear back in Cuba in the 80&#x27;s (no options). The product is cheap and I understand that but I can smell decent cheap products like Brut or Agua Brava but this is just horrendous. Since I put it up, my wife, niece and even males were complaining about an strange and bothering smell. I wish I can return the product but that&#x27;s not an option. I would never recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;m not extreme guy in my critiques, in fact this is my lowest score, but I have to go with the minimum for this one since it is a detestable product.</li>
    <li> Truly a unique and rare scent that others are curious about. I get many compliments about this cologne. People are always wanting to know where they can buy it. Excellent scent, lasts well on me, and the price is beyond belief for the quality of the cologne. I would highly suggest buying this cologne.</li>
    <li> Great cologne at a great price.  Shipment was quick.  This was the second purchase of Thallium and plan on purchasing others in the future.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It has a good masculine scent that lasts.</li>
    <li> I get more compliments about this particular cologne than any other---it lasts a long time and is very distinctive! The real deal!</li>
    <li> always wanted to try the Black,.. I really like it, its more manly then the others and ads nice change</li>
    <li> Everything was great about this cologne. The price, the smell, fast shipping,; &amp; the size. I give this company &amp; this product a 10 out of 10😄</li>
    <li> pretty high quality for the price but isn&#x27;t quite as I imagined it scent wise.</li>
    <li> A very different scent, unique, not for everyone. I haven&#x27;t had any negative comments but, positive comments would have been good. Not sure how well it was received. Personally, i like the scent.</li>
    <li> This, along with the original Thallium, is one of my favorite colognes. Has a very high quality scent for an unbelievable price! Very crisp, yet masculine and maybe even fruity. I always get compliments when wearing this. You will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> Thix EDT starts out with a sweet apple aroma and dries down to a long-lasting darkness that can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> THE FIRST TIME I TRIED THIS FRAGRANCE WAS AT A FRAGRANCE OUTLET I WENT TO. I WAS AMAZED AT THE WONDERFUL AROMA AND RECEIVED POSITIVE COMPLIMENTS ON IT AS WELL. I ALSO HAD TRIED THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS FRAGRANCE AND DIDN&#x27;T KNOW THERE WAS A FLANKER TO THALLIUM. THIS PURCHASE WAS TO GET ANOTHER BOTTLE OF THIS AS I HAD GIVEN MY FIRST BOTTLE AWAY TO A COUSIN. THE  FRAGRANCE ARRIVED ON TIME AS PROMISED.</li>
    <li> the smell is phenomenal. my husband love sit and it is def a winter smell. shipment and product where all good.</li>
    <li> not a pleasant or lasting flavor</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as he likes the original Thallium a lot.  It&#x27;s a much stronger, woodsy fragrance, but it still works on him. Much different from the original. It has a rich, deep smell that reminds me of tree bark - but in a good way.</li>
    <li> Great cologne gothe many compliments</li>
    <li> Scent stays all day long and it is strong. Often get compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered another one. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I brought this cologne for my kids Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent i wore it a few times and i have alot of women at my job ask me the name of this cologne.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so smooth. I get compliments all the time. On how good it smells.</li>
    <li> is excelent... good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne at an outlet mall in Orland Fla. years ago and have been looking around my home town for it since. Amazon, you rock, not only do you have my favorite things, your price cannot be beat. Thanks again for a wonder product at a great price, I will definitely recommend to anyone, this cologne and will be ordering more in the next coming months to stock up on a great find...</li>
    <li> This fragrance is very interesting. It has a personality, it is making you feel magical, like a forest fairy, and it is changing all the time. It&#x27;s a real peace of art. I am very happy with this purchase, I love it and i got a ton of compliment when i wear it.</li>
    <li> Smells like Burberry London for men and last just as long for half the price. A great value and would order again.</li>
    <li> Great scent for day or evening.  Elegant enough for a dinner party, yet still can be used daily.  My wife likes it, therefore, its perfect.  Only draw back is it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day like other higher end scents.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I thought it would and since I use the blue I thought it would be comparable.</li>
    <li> I at first ordered the Thallium Original; which smells better than most (if not all) of the high end fragrances that I have or have smelled.. I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews regarding Thallium Black.. I decided to give it a try.. The first I smelled it, it didn&#x27;t blow me away like the Original Thallium.. But my fiance instantly loved it; and she&#x27;s very picky like me; therefore, I valued her response to it.. After a few days I decided to go ahead and wear it to work.. Then it hit me, I starting liking this fragrance even more after I sprayed it a couple times on me.. On the second application, I started typing this review.. I&#x27;m smelling it on me now and loving it.. Very different from the original; and that&#x27;s a good thing; they have their own unique smell.. I would wear during the fall/winter..  I highly recommend this fragrance; especially for the price ($18) -its a win win..</li>
    <li> You just need to buy all three Thalliums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three are different and serve a different purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUPER DUPER FIRE JUICE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Furious~</li>
    <li> Love every thing about fragrance, as much as I do my 200.00 bottles, I choose the black, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The price is just silly...just go for it.</li>
    <li> Misfortune isn&#x27;t the only thing that comes in threes, every now and again comes that beautiful...trifecta. THALLIUM... Original, Sport, and now intoxicating Black (?)!!! I only have one question...How does one surpass the top of....ANYTHING ?!?! The most amazing thing you&#x27;ve Never known.</li>
    <li> Decent fragrance overall but doesnt last long...bottle is cheapyly made....</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the price and good reviews. I have bought  expensive colognes in the past but didn&#x27;t feeling like spending so much to give something new a try. The price was so reasonable I thought I would give it a shot. I am happy I did!  Smells great and doesn&#x27;t wear off too quickly. Smells like an expensive cologne.</li>
    <li> GOOD COLOGNE ANY DAY ANY TIME. IT DOES NOT ENDURE FOR A LONG TIME BUT THE SMELL IS SUPERB</li>
    <li> love this stuff, does not last very long, but great while it does.... Not like anything else,</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> It smells good I would buy again it has a strong smell that would last .</li>
    <li> Very unique and pleasant. This cologne is just what I have looked for. It is a little strong but only stays that way for minutes and then fades to a pleasant balance and lasts all day! Will get again!</li>
    <li> I previously purchased Thallium as a gift for my son and he liked it so I decided to purchase the Thallium Black for him this time as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> This product is Amazing , better than expected smells fresh and didnt expect to be this good for the price I paid it arrive 4 days latter after purchase</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews and I agree it is a very distinctive fragrance although not very long-lasting.  One thing I did do is I went to my oil guy and bought the oil for this fragrance and used it as a base for the cologne itself...THEN it lasted all day and into the next day!!!  Great fragrance though and great price.</li>
    <li> 3rd bottle now...it has a nice spicy smell and sticks around for awhile..</li>
    <li> I just received mine yesterday... I dont really like it... Smells too much like Polo...  Thallium classic is the best!...</li>
    <li> I would say, I have received best of the compliments with this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;If someone is contemplating buying this, I would surely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;If not super happy, I guarantee you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Has good smell. Great idea for young adults. Excellent buy. Take the chance, I loved it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice cologne. At first i didn&#x27;t like it because i thought the scent was too heavy and sweet. But after smelling a similar, more expensive scent (spice bomb, i think is the name)at a fancy dept. store and liking it, i re-thought my opinion. If you spray just a lite mist, it&#x27;s not bad. It depends how heavy you like your cologne. Considering the price/size/scent ratio, it will do as an everyday perfume. For fancier events, you&#x27;ll definitely want something more upscale in fragrance tone.</li>
    <li> Kind of a hidden gem amongst cheaper colognes... Good bang for the buck... Ballin on a budget.. Definately spicy, but with a sweet touch..</li>
    <li> Very very good smell!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.I wear this cologne so much that It became my favorite cologne over the other top brands i sometimes wear.you wont be disappointed wearing it</li>
    <li> WORKS  BUT DON;T LAST LONG</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst smelling colognes I&#x27;ve ever smelled. I bought it since the reviews were good, I have with many other colognes on Amazon. I&#x27;ve liked the rest of them at least enough to wear them but needless to say this one was a bust. It&#x27;s definite female deterrent. Dollar tree has better smelling stuff. Maybe I&#x27;ll give it to my lady&#x27;s ex...</li>
    <li> This product has a great smell and it is not too strong or overwhelming but it is noticeable, I highly recomment</li>
