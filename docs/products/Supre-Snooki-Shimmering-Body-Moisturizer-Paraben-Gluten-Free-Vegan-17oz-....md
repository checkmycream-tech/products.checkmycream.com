<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I kinda enjoy the scent but my husband hates it, its got a nice shimmer not over the top and great for after tanning!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I usually use Hempz Age Defying, but wanted something different this time.&lt;br /&gt;I use this after I tan, and just after a shower sometimes.  It has a little bit of shimmer which is noticeable when I am out in the sun, otherwise I do not notice the shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion the smell is simply Heavenly, as well as the moisturizing it provides...&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves exceptional Quality, and did I mention how&lt;br /&gt;absolutely wonderful it smells oh and the shimmer it gives your skin is just yummy...xo</li>
    <li> This has worked amazingly so far. I love the smell and the shimmer is amazing I love how it&#x27;s a light shimmer and not over done. recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my legs for a wedding I am attending (I wanted a shimmering lotion). First, there is no shimmer, nothing, zip. Second, the smell is crazy strong, it smells like tanning bed lotion. Therefore, I can&#x27;t wear this to a wedding mostly due to the smell and also it does not have any simmer. Very disappointed in this product, it is terrible unless you want a lotion that makes you smell like tooty-fruity.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a perfume that would give a subtle &#x27;glow&#x27;, NOT some crazy glitter-filled sparkle. This stuff is amazing!!! It really does make your skin glow, and the scent is definitely a warm vanilla. NOT overpowering. It is super smooth and creamy and goes on easily, absorbs fast. I&#x27;m hooked! The fact it doesn&#x27;t have any icky parabens is also a huge plus!</li>
    <li> Grest moisturizer. Smells amazing like bath and body work twilight woods. I get so many compliments  on the fragrance no need for perfume.</li>
    <li> Well, I received it on time but when I open the box it came in there was lotion everywhere! The top was broken and the pump was broken. This is the 2nd time I have orded this and both times they were broken and had lotion everywhere!</li>
    <li> Loved it! Use it everday. Need to order more. Feels great on the skin and looks great.  I definitely buy agsin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! Not to glittery, smells great &amp; keeps your skin soft! Deff will buy this again</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion smells good makes my skin feel soft and it has a shimmer to it not too much.</li>
    <li> Lotion smells amazing and dries in very well. Didn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling. Just the perfect amount if shimmer..makes your skin look like it&#x27;s glowing.</li>
    <li> I love the shimmer &amp; it smells yummy too ! I will definitely order another bottle for my sissy in law! She must have this also! Snooki ... U rock! ðŸ’‹~ Venissa</li>
    <li> Love the smell and shimmer of this lotion! Super fast shipping too :)</li>
    <li> It smells great and the scent actually sticks around. My favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer and love the scent</li>
    <li> smells great and feels great.  I love the little hint of shimmer.  makes my elbows feel very soft and best of all, it&#x27;s vegan!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Came right away! After you put it on you&#x27;re skin has sparkles on it, not bad though. It&#x27;s nice. I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
    <li> Soft, shimmery, smells great!</li>
    <li> This after tan lotion smells ABAOLUTELY WONDERFUL! I love the way it goes on and it has a nice suttle shimmer!! I like to put it on right after a shower/bath! I use it along with SNOOKI&#x27;s tanning lotion!! Its great! Its also nice that it is in a pump bottle!</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle. It&#x27;s not to glittery and smells so yummy. I lalalalalalove it. 😁</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION! Makes my skin look and feel so healthy ! Definitely buying again !!</li>
    <li> First off the shipping was very FAST , gotta love that. This lotion makes my skin so soft. It smells so good, but not over powering. And the shimmer is just enough not like some of these other products where it looks like glitter was thrown on you. This is a hard product to find now a dawys.</li>
    <li> Best glitter lotion ever! Just enough sparkle! Great smell too!</li>
    <li> This lotion is fabulous! ! It leaves your skin feeling so silky smooth and smells yummy! ! I love the subtle hint of shimmer without the full glitter effect. Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> smells super good. i like the consistency of it. it is really good for sensitive skin and ill def buy it again</li>
    <li> Love this product one of my new favorite lotions , love the simmer it&#x27;s not too much or tacky just enough to be noticed, smells great also . Definitely will be purchasing more soon</li>
    <li> Like the way it makes my skin feel and it has a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> In spite of of the name I like the product!  Will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture of the lotion. Arrived fast, but the pump was broken so it&#x27;s near impossible to get it out of the bottle. Other than that, I do like the lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a fragrance that my husband loves! I slather it on before bed every night. I love that it&#x27;s paraben free and has a subtle shimmer. I just ordered 5 more bottles!</li>
    <li> This smells very good and light and makes your hands so soft. It is a big bottle and I love the pump. It is not greasy and is a very well made product.</li>
    <li> Smells very good, long lasting scent. Put on at 6am you can still smell it 12 hours later. I didn&#x27;t think it would be that shimmery as I put it on in house lighting. But once you&#x27;re in the sun you can see all the sparkles. I love it</li>
    <li> I did not like the after effects as it turned my skin orange.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> They say it smells something like vanilla or coconut but it&#x27;s just a weird tropical smell. It has a nice slight shimmer and does make your skin soft.  I like the way my skin feels but the smell is strong and takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Realy good size for the money spent!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this lotion! The scent lasts throughout the day - purchased with tanning and leg tanning lotion was a great combo!</li>
    <li> Its a good lotion, it has nice shimmering which you can see on the sun...its not too shimmery so thats good. I would say it leaves my skin satin smooth..its not that moisturizing...i think like normal lotion..I have to say it has beautiful smell...first day i guess it was too strong for me so I had headache but i got used to it and it smells very nicely! Overall ...good product, nice smell, nice glow, normal moisturizing. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Instantly had an allergic reaction and broke out into hives and throat started closing up! I am not sure what is in the bottle, but it clearly was not for me.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite lotion! I love the shimmer and how well it moisturizes my skin all day. Not to mention the smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> Smells good but I do not see shimmer. I bought this for the shimmer so I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not super moisturizing but slight shimmer is nice. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Everything my wife experience. Great product my wife really enjoys the smell of the product and the softness of her skin, thumbs up with these three products.</li>
    <li> I love this shimmery body lotino the only reason I gave it 4 stars it was not as sparkly as I thought and it said it was..</li>
    <li> The lotion smelled nice (though a bit strong) applied smoothly, and was somewhat moisturizing.  I bought it solely for the shimmer effect though, but there was none.  Before it arrived, I was a bit apprehensive that with the &amp;#34;Snooki&amp;#34; name attached to the product, that it would be too sparkly for my tastes.  Disappointingly though, there was no hint at all of a shimmer that I could see and so didn&#x27;t suit my purpose in purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This has the best scent, and the shimmer is subtle, not overkill. Leaves your skin nice and soft for hours.</li>
    <li> bought this as a Christmas gift for someone else that used this product before I personally will not be using this product will be a Christmas gift</li>
    <li> I Love it- Alot in the bottle can&#x27;t beat the price- only issue I found with it is there is a slight residue left even after rubbing it in -  If you are looking for a decent price lotion I&#x27;d recomend this one.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this because I love the snooki tanning lotions and they smell great, the shimmer is perfect without looking glittery. However, that being said the smell is horrible it smells worse than a bad tanning lotion. I used it twice and shoved it in the back of the cabinet</li>
    <li> I do love how moisturizing this lotion is .. But I think the smell is too strong. Kinda gave me a head ache . If it suited me better I would have rated 5 for how thick the lotion is .</li>
    <li> Cute bottle smells good shimmers a lot…. Daughter loved it didn&#x27;t care about the vegan portion but it did just what it should</li>
    <li> Not loving the fact that I like a Snooki product but I must say it&#x27;s very nice smelling and leave a slight shimmer on skin. I do like it a lot. Would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I get SOOOOOO many compliments on this i can&#x27;t even say!!! A must buy Definitely. You shimmer and smell sooooo amazing all day long! Guys drool over this scent. No joke! LOVE ITTTT!</li>
    <li> Great scent! It&#x27;s not too over bearing stays on for quite awhile and love the shimmer its a nice touch!</li>
    <li> Has shimmer and smells nice</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the lotion--not greasy or too thick.  Great for using after tanning.  I also like the light shimmer.  I do not like the scent, which is why I&#x27;m only giving it four instead of five stars.  A person made a comment that someone smelled like marshmallows, in a group of women.  I had just put on the lotion.  That&#x27;s basically the scent of this lotion, in my opinion.  She did say it smelled good, however.  Don&#x27;t think I would buy again due to the marshmallow/candy scent.</li>
    <li> I definitely wont be buying this moisturizer again. It wasn&#x27;t really shimmery like it says and it has an unpleasant smell, kind of like a clay or play-doh smell. I highly recommend the Kardashian Glow Tan Extender. It really does prolong my tan and has a great smell and texture to it.</li>
    <li> I received this lotion today and absolutely love it! It smells so good and the smell lasts while. (I showered and put it on about 11 today and it is almost 4 and smell hasn&#x27;t faded). The shimmer isn&#x27;t bad! Gives just a little shine in the sun. Makes skin very soft after use. So far I would definately tells my friends/family about this lotion for sure! And will most likely be a routine buyer! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly good. It absorbs well, no over-lotion glob lines, and the shimmer is quite nice - not glitter but a more subtle transparent kind of shimmer, but you can see it - especially in the sun. The smell is not my favorite but it&#x27;s not bad, to me it smells like cotton candy, which is a little weird but what it lacks in smell appeal (to me) it makes up for in quality and shimmer factor. I&#x27;m actually going to order it again despite the neon tiger-striped bottle and cotton candy thing. Wish it came in other scents.</li>
    <li> Delivery on time!!! Smells delicious!!!! and i like its design :) Snooki products are great!!!  it has glitter and gives a little shine to your skin</li>
    <li> Is okay would recommend it. Smells good.v</li>
    <li> lotion is wonderful,but I now have had to use this lotion as giveaway on my counter because bottle top,pump was broke off and lotion in bag.</li>
    <li> When I bought this I knew that it would be glittery!!! But it was to glittery! Other than that it smells great and I love that it is Vegan!!!</li>
    <li> this is my fav after tan moisturizer, the shimmer is light and a love that and it will make your tan loast and stay ,the smell is great .this is a must for any tanner i have gotten all of mine here on amazon and it is the real deal</li>
    <li> It barely has any shimmer. But is very noticeable outside in the sun. The smell reminds of the beach and moisterizers very well.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing.. leaves skin feeling nice &amp; soft ! Light shimmer is perfect. I think i&#x27;m on my third bottle of this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have ordered 5 of these throughout the last 2 years. By far my FAVORITE after tanning lotion! The shimmer in it is very light, smell is so awesome! I always get compliments even if I just wear it as a lotion when I go out. I highly recommend this! Arrived so fast, packaged safely,very affordable &amp; will be ordering more as I get low on it.</li>
    <li> When I received this item in the mail the top was broken and the lotion was all over the bottle.  I had ordered it for my daughter for Christmas and it was to late to send back and re-order since she lives in Detroit.  So basically this was a waste for me and she did not get to enjoy this gift.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend tans and she gets pretty dark, and she seems to love this. I on the other hand am so painfully white I don&#x27;t so much shimmer like a vampire as am blinding white like Casper, lol so I have no use for this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion, and it really does shimmer.  Also it has a pleasant light smell.</li>
    <li> this lotion gives just the right amount of shimmer to my body, and smells wonderful!!! I will continue to buy Snooki products, they are great!!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product; I keep a stock of it on hand! It keeps my skin silky and shimmery with a great fragrance!</li>
    <li> this lotion is absolutely amazing. the smell lasts all day long on your skin and keeps your skin smooth. the shimmer is very light so it is not overpowering. i dont think i will use another lotion ever again!</li>
    <li> I have re ordered this product a number of times and I really like it.  Works very good.  Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It smells good and goes on well. I was worried about the shimmer looking more like glitter, but its subtle and gives you more of a natural glow.</li>
    <li> Lotion was delivered by promise date along with the snooki tanning lotion. Smells great. Not leaving a 5 because when I opened the package the lotion pump was broken and it had leaked out lotion not a lot but still disappointed. It looked like it was packaged the the big bubble wrap but it was completely deflated and appeared to be no holes so im not sure.</li>
    <li> Snooki shimmer moisturizer is amazing! Personally, I love the smell, the fact it isn&#x27;t sticky and how it goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome lotion that is thick and rich and smells divine.  I will recommend it to any of my friends who are looking for a tan extender. It is wonderful and feels wonderful and not sticky on your skin.</li>
    <li> I use this every day all year now. I&#x27;m completely addicted to the smell (a little warm vanilla?) and after feel of this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy but is like silk and leaves your skin feeling that way. I use it all day on my hands, immediately after washing my hands, and on my footsies at bed time. Great stuff and arrived fast both times I ordered. It comes completely sealed and shrink wrapped which I thoroughly appreciate!!! Definitely  recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this at my tanning salon and fell in love. Smells awesome! Looks great! Feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> Not too much shimmer, it&#x27;s more of a slight glow but not what I expected. Scent is just okay, its a little too musky for me.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft, shimmering and smelling great! Would definately purchase again. Very reasonably priced. The only problem I had when I received the item, was that the nozzle wasd broken on the bottle, but that may have happened during shipping, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all. The smell is great, not what I was expecting based on all the reviews. It smells a lot like vanilla. It&#x27;s super smooth and absorbs quickly and shimmers like crazy! I have noticed that after wearing it to bed, the next day little specs of glitter fall off my skin, not a huge deal but it hurts when they end up in my eye! I will buy again though:)</li>
    <li> The shimmer in this is just subtle enough for a pretty shine. Some shimmer causes me to itch -like if it&#x27;s glitter. This product doesn&#x27;t. Also, it has a really nice smell - I am always getting compliments.</li>
    <li> Nice glitter lotion, subtle, and not greasy.</li>
    <li> love it well buy again</li>
    <li> The top was broken when arrived.. kinda sticky overall probably wont buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It was exactly what I had expected.  Delivery was fast!!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great lotion/moisturizer..&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. This was my second bottle, now I&#x27;m lost if I leave home without it.</li>
    <li> This lotion does exactly what it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The scent is an alluring blend of aromas that are neither over powering, or too floral/perfume-esque. It lasts for the entire day of wear without souring or fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The shimmer is an attractive, healthy glow the lotion adds to your skin. It is NOT a paste of glitter brushed over your body. It is very mild, soft shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This lotion moisturizes and helps hydrate even between uses. While it is recommended to use daily, I have skipped a day periodically and my skin still retains my dark tan, silky texture and in this harsh winter temperature it looks healthier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this lotion is both tanners, or just anyone looking for a moisturizer that leaves you looking, smelling and feeling more attractive.</li>
    <li> I love the product but the one thing is when i got it in the mail the pump was broken and some of the moisturizer had seeped out and i had to tape the pump back together. make sure if ordering this you make sure they pack it extra safe</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells great, moisturizes great. Love the shimmer. Makes my skin look and feel awesome. It is a huge bottle so it will def. last me a while! :)</li>
    <li> Smells amazing..moisterizes even the driest skin..absolutely love it.!</li>
    <li> Shimmer is very pretty but not moisturizing at all</li>
    <li> This lotion is very light but it leaves my skin feeling silky. There is a light shimmer and the smell is really great. It doesn&#x27;t undermine the perfume I wear, but is scented enough to be noticable. I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> The package was to small as well as the pump was busted and bottle and was all over the place and they will not replace it</li>
    <li> I love the way this lotion goes on my skin and leaves a little sparkle behind.  Makes my skin feel soft, I really love this lotion.  It&#x27;s definitley worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product. I really was impressed by this lotion I have used it everyday&lt;br /&gt;It has a great smell and it just makes my skin feel really soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Gives me a great sparkly look and feels smooth. The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but it works. Cute bottle as well.</li>
    <li> Not overly shimmery, and has a great scent. I am Very happy with it.I Use it every day too! ♡♥</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it ! And it was here very quickly !</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. it smells so nice and leaves my skin feeling so soft,</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion. The shimmer is very subtly and i like the smell. I have been tanning for a month now and use this daily and after I tan. I have not peeled and am holding my color very well. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Smells great and keeps my skin feeling very soft!!!!</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing! It does smell like vanilla (like everyone else said). I was a little worried about the shimmer because I figured it would be way too shimmery and way too overpowering, but its not. The shimmer is subtle but pretty.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was unopened and unused.&lt;br /&gt;My only con so far is it doesn&#x27;t make me as soft as I would like, I would like it more if it was just a little more moisturizing. (Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not terribly dry! I would just like it more with a tiny bit more moisture).</li>
    <li> This product is the best. It moisturizes AND shimmers! I get many compliments about smelling great when I wear it :D</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s smells really really good! Every time I use it, my family noticed how good I smell. The smell doesn&#x27;t last long though...so you won&#x27;t be walking around all day with a strong scent! When I first used it, I definitely thought there was no sparkle. I thought I might have gotten the wrong item, but there is sparkle.....very very light sparkle. You will only see it in sunlight, so you won&#x27;t look like a disco ball by using it! It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite after tanning lotions!!</li>
    <li> Its just like a regular lotion with a tad bit of shimmer im not very impressed. I would rather have a lotion from victorias secret then this. The shimmer is very light hardly noticeable and it doesnt smell the greatest.</li>
    <li> i love it after going to the tanning bed , and soaking in hot water . when you put this cream on it makes your skin feel.soft and smooth i love it ..i use it even if i dont go to the tanning bed .</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing , leaves skin glittery which I like some might not . After tanning this leaves my skin so soft smelling good and feeling fresh</li>
    <li> Arrived expediently, but the fragrance is overwhelming and unpleasant to me, and I find there is no shimmer at all.  Will send it back.</li>
    <li> Great smell and lotion.</li>
    <li> The smell of the lotion is awesome and the shimmer isnt too much. The pump broke after a couple weeks, which is the only reason im voting four stars. Other than that i love it.!</li>
    <li> No lasting shimmer. I don&#x27;t care for it. Didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize well and left me sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! Smells good, absorbs quickly, and has just s touch of shimmer. Very satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> Great love the shimmering it leaves on your skin also the smell is great too! Iwill buy this product again</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!! I love how the skin sparkles in the sun light too! The scent is amazing and lasts all day!! I will repurchase this lotion for sure.</li>
    <li> Love love love! Good and fast shipping and works really well.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this simmering,  vanilla citrus smelling lotion. I love it ♥ and get so many compliments on the scent. Its not too thick nor runny. Snookie did well, lol</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good moisturizer that was paraben free, and this is a good product for those reasons.  But the flimsy pump top broke on the first try.  I don&#x27;t care for the strange fragrance of it, which some reviewers liked and others didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells absolutely disgusting.  I put a Lil bit on my arm and it smelled so bad I had to go wash it off. I will never wear this so it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got the wrong bottle or something because I usually love all of Snooki&#x27;s other beauty products, however this one was terrible.  I hated the smell.  It was like that cheap perfume that you get from the mall when you are 11years old that they give away for free.  I  returned it immediately.  Disappointing. FAIL.</li>
    <li> One of my most favorite moisturizers ever, light sparkle in it that is amazing</li>
    <li> The smell is great! Reminds me a little of indoor tanning lotion. At first I was disappointed in the shimmer. I didn&#x27;t think it had any . But...then I went outside and wow. Hello shimmer. It is great! Also you get a lot of lotion for the price. I was looking for a great lotion with shimmer and this is great!</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail today after two days of waiting, and I love it. The shimmer is just enough and the scent, to me, is a warm sugar with a hint of coconut. Although, I was disappointed that the pump was broken when I opened the box. I think they should bubble wrap the lotion so it isn&#x27;t banging around. But happy with it regardless.</li>
    <li> notmoisturizing at all and barely any shimmer at all, at rip off if u ask me</li>
    <li> I love this shimmer lotion! The smell is a little different, if you like the scent of heavy vanilla you won&#x27;t mind. The shimmer is light so you don&#x27;t have to worry about over doing it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I love the shimmer it&#x27;s not too much just enough. The smell is not my favorite but not awful. Keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t  speak about this seller, as I purchased this elsewhere.  The pump didn&#x27;t  work on the first  bottle I purchased.  Subsequent  purchases have been fine.  I am a fan of this product because of the slight shimmer it gives, it is vegan, I like the smell, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and the cooling effect it has on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t  have &amp;#34;coolers&amp;#34; in it, but it does cool and soothe.  It moisturizes enough, but not intensely if you are parched.  The big bottle lasts.  It does NOT do anything to bronze or extend your tan, other than the moisturizing effect.  I recommend  giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I only like this product because of the glitter added to the lotion. I love the smell and it rubs onto the skin amazingly and leaves skin moisturized however I really don&#x27;t like how noticeable the glitter is on the skin.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever! Love the scent, I am always getting complemented on how good I smell.. A must have with the shower gel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definately something I love and will continue to buy. It makes my skin so soft and it has a glow with a lil shimmer it&#x27;s awesome. I dont leave the house without using it. I use it everytime I walk into the bathroom or my bedroom..that&#x27;s how much I love it! I have one in every room. Including my purse. :)</li>
    <li> this is a great lotion/moisturizer! I highly recommend it to everybody!!!!&lt;br /&gt;it does leave a light shimmer, not a major glitter effect though, but I don&#x27;t want that, I just want the light shimmer, which is what this does, you can see the shimmer and it is very nice, I love to look at my arms or legs and see the shimmer, it is brighter in the sun of course and more shimmery...&lt;br /&gt;it smells pretty good as well...&lt;br /&gt;and it leaves my skin feeling wonderful!!! super moisturizering!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to use this for sure after tanning, I always do, but I also use it every morning as well, and throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;I am going to have to order a couple more of these asap, so that I have an extra bottle so that I never run out, and one so that I can carry it with me, and always have it, using it instead of the lotion I normally used, I like this so much better!&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It smells awesome, really nourished my skin and the shimmer gives it just the right glow.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion. It is shimmery, but not too much. It&#x27;s a subtle shimmer. The fragrance is a little on the strong side, but it smells nice. I recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the body wash, which I love as well. It&#x27;s a big bottle so I hope it lasts a while. I&#x27;m gradually becoming addicted to Snooki products.</li>
    <li> I ADORE this lotion!!! Like you don&#x27;t even understand it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I have ever made. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed in a Snooki product and this time is no different, this lotion smells absolutely amazing, like vanilla &amp; candy. The shimmer looks beautiful on everyone (but especially if you have a tan!) It&#x27;s a must get for the summer, and I plan on repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Smells great and adds a nice glow to the skin</li>
    <li> This product was just as pictured, it was at a great price, and it really worked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a humongous fan of Snooki, but she&#x27;s the tannest chick i&#x27;ve ever seen, so I thought I&#x27;d give this lotion a go.  The packaging is pretty and the lotion itself works very well. It has a soft vanilla scent and keeps my skin hydrated all day. I have sensitive skin and eczema. This lotion doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all. The shimmer is subtle. But you&#x27;ll look like Twilght when u step into the sun. Diamond skin!</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful! Smells like summertime to me. It has a light sent of coconut with shimmer. Leaves my skin very soft and the sent stays for awhile. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Best smelling lotion I have used ; )</li>
    <li> This lotion smells AMAZING and while the scent from the other products in this line fade after shower or shortly after application this product&#x27;s fragrance stays with you. This lotion is just a moisturizer and thus contains no bronzers or tanning agents for salon tanning. I am in my 30&#x27;s and in an effort to prevent premature aging I avoid tanning beds however I do use sunless tanning products,which this works well over. I purchased this lotion because I was told by tanning bed users how greatly and how deeply this lotions moisturizes,while feeling weightless and non greasy on and was also told that it does not clog pores.Tanners have pores that are open especially immediately after tanning and are generally larger than those that avoid uv rays. Tanner&#x27;s skin is also quite dry so if avid tanners agree that it moisturizes and does not clog pores,my thought was that my skin would see great benefits from this product. This lightweight,non greasy lotion DEEPLY softens the skin,moisturizes the skin and does not clog pores. Again I do not tan in booths nor outside but I do work in a tanning salon and frequent the spray tan booth. Our women LOVE this lotion. This lotion has a fine glitter in it that is not big,gaudy or obvious like body glitter. It leaves a subtle,shimmer to the skin that is great when stacked on prominent bony areas like the collarbone,shoulder caps,shins and pelvis. The smell is one I would love to see in a perfume. Overall I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the products in this line given the quality one would come to expect given the name attached to it. That said the products have NOT disappointed and the fragrance should certainly be marketed as a perfume. Our salon also carries the body scrub,body wash and tanning bed lotions as well as the full line of sunless products and our women all love them. The quality for the price cannot be beat either.</li>
    <li> i love snooki so when i started tanning this summer i needed to get some things from her line. this lotion has definitely grown on me from the faint shimmer, the smell and over all feel. it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, especially for everyday tanners like myself. you don&#x27;t get that caked on, oily lotion feel and the smell (which is amazing) stays with you all day. the shimmer is very light, you can really only see it in the sun or bright lighting. i&#x27;m ordering my second bottle plus the moisturizing body wash this time too. i recommend this to anyone even if you aren&#x27;t hitting the tanning beds</li>
    <li> love it ....Great smell and it has shimmers to it after applying</li>
</ol>
