<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i am not sure if it is doing what it claims. it claims to thicken existing hair follicles (like \\&quot;clinically proven\\&quot; claims). i have used half a bottle over about a 2 months and cant really see any difference yet. but then again, that isnt a lot of time. at least my gf thinks it smells really nice -- will probably try at least one more bottle time to see if it works. update you then      update. aug 2014: yea i am still not sure if its doing anything. but i still have the same amount of hair as before i started so its not hurting.</li>
    <li> Even though I felt this product was a little pricey I decided to order it.  I am very happy with the product after only using it 3 times.  I was also very impressed with how quickly I received the product.  It arrived at least three days before the earliest date I was given to expect it.  I would not hesitate ordering from this vendor again, when I need to replace the product.</li>
    <li> I love Nioxin. but a little of this goes a long way.  I used too much the 1st time &amp; had to take another shower as my hair became hard &amp; wild. I rarely use it.</li>
    <li> Not all products are for everyone and maybe this is&#x27;t for me.  I saw no significant change in my hair after using this product!</li>
    <li> I saw this product recommended in a magazine.  It intrigued me because it said Hollywood stars were using this instead of extensions.  I thought really???  I have worn my hair up for several years because it is so fine that you can see through my hair at the bottom section and I hate it.  I applied 6 to 8 pumps of this product after washing my hair and styled as normal.  I was blown away by how much thicker my hair looked.  It is expensive but the results are there.  It also has a nice scent to it that I found pleasant.</li>
    <li> I would purchase this item in bulk since I have baby fine hair.  It makes such a difference in the look of my hair.  The group that sold the product was wonderful and sent the product immediately.  They were great.</li>
    <li> I battle with my hair daily.  Baby fine, breaking off and of course now getting very thin. I have tried soooooo many products in the attempt to have my hair feel fuller and not weighted down and healthy looking. This stuff does it all...fullness, soft shiny almost to good to be true.  I dont care how it works, I will continue to use it!  Finish this with the Nioxin Power Hold Spray and I am actually facing the day without my normal bad hair day blues.  I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with Systems 1 and  2 and I must say I am very impressed with the transformation I have experienced on both my scalp and texture of existing hair... I can actually feel thicker hair. Bear in mind this is not designed to regrow new hair but to strengthen the scalp which in turn nourishes existing hair...it&#x27;s odorless and non-greasy so one needn&#x27;t be concerned about that if applied during the day. I would unhesitatingly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product works wells especially with color treated hair</li>
    <li> Love the stuff. Have been using it for a long time</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product if you are taking Antabuse.  When I apply it was probably one of the worst pains and really hurt my scalp.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me during a period when I shed a lot of hair and was noticeably thin on top.  Luckily it grew back in a few months but I know it will happen to me again so I tried this along with shake-in powders during that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ I really like the scent&lt;br /&gt;+ It provides extra volume especially in the part area where I was the most self conscious bc you could see the most scalp there.&lt;br /&gt;+ I used it in conjunction with the shake-in air fibers which I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;- it makes your hair look like a brillo pad. I have curly hair so it&#x27;s not too noticeable to others but it is to me. If your hair is already coarse then it&#x27;s no big deal I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend trying it because I do think it works and it is worth seeing how it looks in your own hair.</li>
    <li> Left my hair soft and wavy</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B006ZN1B1S Nioxin Diamax Thickening Xtrafusion Treatment 3.38 Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;The hair treatment arrived on time and in good shape.  It does add some thickness to my hair which is fine and fragile.  I use it in conjunction with Nioxin Follicle Booster for maximum results.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to try this product because I already use the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner with good results, and I have to say it&#x27;s worth the extra money. I was put off by the price at first, but I&#x27;m glad I bought it because it gives my hair major volume without weighing it down. I&#x27;ve use many products for thin hair, and this is among the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> First time using this product, does seem to thicken the hair up.  A decent scent and lasts a long time.  Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find Diamax to do anything even close to &#x27;thickening&#x27; and won&#x27;t reorder.  I think it&#x27;s vastly over priced especially for the small quantity in bottle and over rated.  I&#x27;ll go back to using a volumizing gel.  Was a costly mistake.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I have been using it for two years and my baby fine, brittle hair damaged by processing, disease and medications is the healthiest it has ever been.</li>
    <li> I dont think this product worked for my thinning hair. I didnt see a difference using it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Everyone should try to see the difference it makes to the hair.  My hair seems thicker and is growing out stronger.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this on a regular basis, perhaps if I did I might see some improvement.  You do have to use a lot each time and there really isn&#x27;t that much in the bottle.  I am afraid it would cost a fortune to use this product as directed.  I will try using it as directed but I am not hopeful.  There are no miracles out there for those of us with thinning, fragile hair.  Nioxin does understand the condition and many of their products do actually give the appearance of working.</li>
    <li> Whether these &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; results are due to Diamax, or the arsenal of vitamins and thin hair remedy shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners I use, not sure…  However, I am growing lots of new hair where I tend shed a couple times annually.  So don&#x27;t enjoy that cycle!  If I can minimize this in anyway, I will continue with Nioxin, and all the other products I&#x27;m using.  I have re-purchased this at least a few times.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed much benefit from using the Nioxin Diamax.  It does seem to just make a bit of stiffness in my hair and thus it looses it&#x27;s curl easier.</li>
    <li> This really works..have had thinning hair issues since Chemo...13 years ago...never quite came back..this stuff works ....have seen a huge difference in just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product ! I have really thin hair and  Tried a lot of thickening products and love this one . Worth the money !</li>
    <li> Waiting to see results.</li>
    <li> Videos on line were good instructions. Again, a fresh, clean fragrance. Easy to apply since the nozzle directs the product exactly where you want it. It goes a long way (my hair is short)</li>
    <li> The product had a low price. But the box was ripped open and it appeared as though it may have been used an returned.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while now...it makes my very fine thin hair look so much thicker and I can style my hair so much better.!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Another wonderful product to battle thinning hair. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better system. My hair is thicker and fuller.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Leaves my hair feeling fuller and not like I have product on it. Hair is still shiny and very managable.</li>
    <li> This seller has very fast, and thorough delivery.  The product is probably the best and most fast acting on the market but I do wish it could work faster.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This item was returned I did not use this pray.I do know that it does work a co-work of mine also got this spray and it worked for her.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love, love...Did I say I love it! My hair is fabulous since using this product.  Nioxin was suggested by my hairstylist.  I purchased System 5 and also decided to use the Diamax.  In 2 weeks, when I returned to my stylist, not only was my hair fuller, it went thru what she decribed as a \\&quot;growth spurt\\&quot;. I wear my hair natural and it is curly...it continues to be curly, but also softer and growing faster!</li>
    <li> HELPS TO GET THAT MUCH NEEDED  BODY IN MY FINE HAIR!  I NOW CAN HOLD A CURL. IT HELPS STIMULATE MY SCALP FOR MORE  NEW GROWTH.</li>
    <li> I never really believed in hair products that supposedly helped your hair issues but when I had health issues that made my hair thin I found Nioxin and it does do what it promises.  I order even when I still have some so I always have a back up!</li>
    <li> Love this product, works like magic to improve the thickness of your hair.  Nioxin has great product in general and I use the shampoo and conditioner as well.  Its well worth it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have fine hair, I don&#x27;t have thick hair.  I guess I have what you&#x27;d call flat, straight, boring hair.  I don&#x27;t style it outside of maybe adding a little mousse or hairspray, or using the blowdryer to add volume.  I was delighted to try this product out through a full sized sample from a beauty product subscription service. The cost for my subscription service is $21 a month for several products, so I was very pumped to get this as it made the cost about $5.  Pros:  Smells great!  Does not leave hair greasy or bogged down. Easily spritzes. Quick to use.  Cons: Small bottle for price, high alcohol content, questionable results.  I would go as far as to say that if there weren&#x27;t so many positive reviews, that this product as little better than any other worthless snake oil product.  After using 3/4 of the bottle, I see no results at all in the thickness of my hair or any change, really.  For those that do experience results, I have to wonder how much of that may be the hair shaft drying out and expanding a bit due to the high alcohol content in this product. I do use conditioner on my hair, and am curious if that affects the result, or if this product is truly ONLY for people with fine, thinning hair.  I tried all my normal beauty routines as pertains to my hair with it, and nothing out of the ordinary.  Overall, I cannot say I would purchase this product.  Even if the cost were $5, it&#x27;s $5 too much because I experienced no results. I did like the smell and that it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, but no results at all? It&#x27;s one thing for others not to notice a change, quite another when I do when my hopes were so high.  Super bummed because I wanted to LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin hair care products for close to 20 years and have been happy with the product!! Diamax definitely made my very fine, thin, wavy hair appear thicker. It seems to have a lot of alcohol in it and it irritated my scalp. It has taken 3 weeks and switching brands and 2 hot oil treatments to get my scalp back to almost normal (still a tiny bit of sensitivity) I will not be using Diamax again!!</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine thinning hair and have tried many many products through the years to give my hair fullness and products promising restructure/regrowth.  This is one that I have found to truly work and would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of heavy.. I found it to weigh my hair down. I like&lt;br /&gt;the Nioxin Scalp Therapy System 1 for fine hair much&lt;br /&gt;better.</li>
    <li> I was upset because my hairline was receding and overall thinning, but since I started using this product, I have very fine hair growing at the hairline.  I don&#x27;t use after every shampoo because it does have a bit of a stiffening quality and sometimes I just want my hair to feel flowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> I really like this product in conjunction with System 6.  It made my roots look fuller (similar to a root elevator product) and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy.  Excited to see results over time!</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels and smells and it also made my hair have that extra umph that I wanted!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really seem to do anything... and for this price, definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> I saw some review and would like to try it myself. Overall I don&#x27;t feel any benefit but at least it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
    <li> A little pricy but made my hair feel thicker &amp; fuller-I do not us heat on my hair-dries naturally-when using this product my hair was more course when it dried-looked thicker as well.</li>
    <li> I have a medium short hair of about size 4, thin hair in the frontal and mid scalp area and a partial bald spot on the crown with very thin to little hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product smells great, is very light and absolutely not oily. Makes hair look and feel very healthy and shiny. It adds volume better than any other products I have tried and I have tried many. Most of the others make my thin hair weigh down, or sticky and shabby. There is no need to blow dry too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually the areas where I have thin hair, it&#x27;s not easy to comb and make it look it makes any sense. After applying this product and letting it just air dry, the hair feels very volumized. I am actually able to comb my hair in those areas and it holds very well. But at the crown where I have very thin hair to a partial bald spot, it helps only a little. It is still better than not having it. I was expecting something which will cover my bald spot a little by pumping up the little hair in that area but that&#x27;s not the case nor is the promise of the product. Bottom line is for men who have thin hair, this product will help you but for men who have a partial/visible bald spot with very thin to little hair, it does not help.</li>
    <li> Have noticed a difference in the strength and thickness of my hair since using this for the last 2 months</li>
    <li> Only ok.  Not better, not worse than a million other products.  No reason to buy it again--expensive too. Right now trying Kenra products and am cautiously pleased.</li>
    <li> I used all bottle already, after one month, and I can not tell the difference!:( Maybe I should use it longer, but then I have to buy more, and still not shore getting result!:(</li>
    <li> thank you, needed this and the price was sooooo right.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a couple of weeks ago. It really helped stop a lot of my hair from falling out. I was skeptical at first but its really working for me. I see less hair in the sink. I smile now because i almost can count the few strands whereas before i was cleaning out a sink full of hair and sweeping up a floor filled with hair also.</li>
    <li> I tried this product several times. After using it for a week, my scalp began to burn each time I sprayed it in. I finally looked at the ingredients and the main ingredient is alcohol. Uugghh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued to use the product and during week two, my scalp continued to burn and turned bright red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Diamax for another 2 weeks before the burn and redness made me stop. I did not ever notice my hair thickening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting for 4 weeks, for my scalp to heal, I decided to try it again and my experience repeated itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin will only refund your money for 60 days if you keep your receipt. Unfortunately for me, I had waited to long to try for the refund. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Thickening Spray gave me, personally, much better results, and I recommend it over this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think there is a product out there that can help me.  So for me the product doesn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;  Sorry wish it did.</li>
    <li> The price was amazing, the shipping was great, but having used this product before, I felt this was a little watered down and has not given my hair the body I am used to.</li>
    <li> My shampoo use all of the time.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it I thought I had found a miracle. My hair is fine,limp, straight and I don&#x27;t have alot of it either. After the first use my hair had alot more volume and body, but after day 3 or so it went back to the way it was before.  I would still recommend it for someone who does&#x27;nt use any product. but not the miracle I was looking for.</li>
    <li> ARG! AWFUL!! Scalded my skin &amp; made my scalp itch! When I tried to return it, I was notified that it was &#x27;hazardous&#x27; material &amp; couldn&#x27;t go thru the mail!! My money was refunded but I wasn&#x27;t allowed to mail it back. Yikes! Use caution in deciding to order this stuff!</li>
    <li> Has really helped with my thinning hair without changing the effect I want when styling works well with the shampoo and rise too!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with product. It does what is says and it smells terrific! Great product for thinning hair!!!!</li>
    <li> Adds volume and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  The product thickens hair and my hair does look fuller especially at the top where my hair is becoming more sparse.  It&#x27;s also very easy to use; just a few pumps and you&#x27;re done.  There is no odor which is very important to me.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product takes the flyaways out of my hair but as far as growing hair.  Well I don&#x27;t know about that</li>
    <li> This product is working well to help my fine thinning hair to have body.  One of the few products I&#x27;ve tried that really works.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work didn&#x27;t see results</li>
    <li> It really hasn&#x27;t done anything for my hair that I was expecting.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  I wanted something that would help my hair from getting so thin.</li>
    <li> My stylist introduced me to this product.  Just apply sparingly to the roots.  Too much isnt good.  When I paid a handsome sum at the stylists, I decided to search for this product and found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product.  I am very happy with the product and the service I received. I always recommend this site and this product.</li>
    <li> Repeat customers. My wife loves the Nioxin line of products. This vendor was fast with the shipment.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product . If the U.S. Calvary had this during the many Native American Forays last century, there would have been a lot less hair loss..</li>
    <li> The product acts a gel or mouse that thickens the hair</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a huge difference</li>
    <li> I have bought this product many times in retail stores and am very familiar with the packaging and results.&lt;br /&gt;When this product arrived, it was missing the Nioxin box that should come in and when I used the product it did not yield the same results.  Another thing I noticed is that the two bottles I purchased had uneven amounts in the jar - which is quite suspicious as well.</li>
    <li> Sorry but my hair isn&#x27;t even that thin and I can assure you Diamax is garbage. I&#x27;m shocked Nioxin would even let this hit the shelves.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any kind of results from using this product and so I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> It appears to be working.  Noticed my hair looks thicker around the area where it started to look thinner.  I also use the Nioxin System.</li>
    <li> I have really thinning hair &amp; have tried a multitude of products claiming they produce thicker hair. Diamax is the first one that actually works. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!  I told my dermatologist about it she is passing it along to her patients with thin hair problems-she&#x27;s had some good feedback.</li>
    <li> I tried the shampoo and conditioner and it severely dried my hair out so I had to go back to my Salon shampoo. I decided to try this product out just to see if it would possibly help make my hair thicker without using the harsher shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this products does work for me. I have straight thin hair due to coming off birth control pills and this product makes my hair feel and look fuller. It took about 2 weeks but I am shedding a bit less. So I plan on using this as long as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a try even if you can&#x27;t use their three step system. Their system is not for me but I love the Diamax.</li>
    <li> I started using this 2 weeks back and hope in the next 10-15 days I start seeing results / less thinning or hair loss.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really gives my hair volume</li>
    <li> 3rd time I bought it, it works!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month. Originally I was quite hopeful this product would be helpful to me because of the general good reviews. Unfortunately, in my case, the only change I have received from this product is a case of dandruff. The product is very drying to the scalp.</li>
    <li> really makes my thinning hair appear fuller. Just wish it was cheaper</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Makes my hair full and look fuller. Definitely recommend.  AND the price is great much more affordable than purchasing at Ulta</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think very much of this product</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It adds fullness to the area in the front of my hair - enough that I don&#x27;t feel self conscious.</li>
    <li> Finally I found a product that helps with my very thin, very fine hair without gunking it up and making me have  to wash it more often</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have thin hair and this product works well for me.  Along with this product I use Nixon Thickening Spray.&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair and this makes my hair look and feel thicker.</li>
    <li> Must do some good as my wife keeps ordering refills. She claims it makes her hair does look thicker. The Nioxin has always been promptly delivered, sufficiently packaged, and arrived without issue. Gets a little pricey with the shipping (my gripe) when you order regularly.</li>
    <li> This was the worst product to use on my hair. I&#x27;m still debating if the product was even authentic or not. The product was all alcohol which actually made my hair look even thinner. It ended up drying up my roots which in return made my hair fall out even more. Overall not a good product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product in the salon and was very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;I do not understand why, but the product I received through Amazon does not work as well.  I have wondered why and what the difference in the two products would be since the price through Amazon was almost 1/2 of what I pay at the salon.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my doctor who thinks highly of it. I can tell it adds fullness to my hair. Will be ordering it again in the future.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in hair volume as advertised, especially for the price, won&#x27;t be buying this again for awhile.</li>
    <li> It works!!!!  Nothing more to say.  Put it on as it says and let it do its job. &#x27;Nough said.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still debating whether this product is worth the investment. Its a small bottle for the price and will only last about a month.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> The results were instant for me&lt;br /&gt;Great product... I recommend it, you hair look Lucius , more volume and body,</li>
    <li> Great product, and found the best price on Amazon.com. Packed well and sipped promptly.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the Nioxin products with no success. My scalp is balding in several places and I was ready to try anything. I really wanted it to work and after going through 2 bottles I noticed no change. My hair became very dry and felt rough and overall did not look healthy after I started using the Diamax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a side note I used this in conjunction with shampoo, conditioner, hair booster and scalp therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Nioxin for over 8 months I will not be purchasing any more of their products. I&#x27;m going to spend all the money I would used for Nioxin products and just invest in a real hair wig.</li>
    <li> didnt seem or look authenic!!  sent it back.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My hair is very thin and now looks much thicker I&#x27;m very pleased with the results, I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. Great for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I use this on damp hair, after shampooing/conditioner &amp; I&#x27;ve gotta say that it really makes my hair look and feel thicker! I ran out a while back, and I thought &amp;#34;something is missing&amp;#34;...it was not using Diamax. If you have fine, thinning hair &amp; need to give it a boost-this is a must!</li>
    <li> after many weeks of reading reviews on these products i finally decided to give in because my bestie&#x27;s wedding is in a few months and i am the maid of honor and i wanted my hair to be thicker and longer by wedding time. i purchased the complete nioxin system number 4 cleanser, scalp therapy, scalp treatment, and diamax spray. i have highlighted hair and have been highlighting it for 9 years, i am 25 years old now. my life long hair stylist would always comment on how healthy my hair was and would praise me for being her favorite client who would take such good care of my hair. it wasnt until i used this system together for a week straight that my highlights all of a sudden started having a lot of breakage. i panicked at the sight because ive never experienced that before. i called my stylist and told her what happened and she has me on a strict hair regimen to try to prevent anymore breakage and hairloss from happening due to the damage that nioxin did in screwing up my beautiful hair. i had used the nioxin tablets years ago before they discontinued them and they were great so i thought this system would work but instead i have suffered so much, not only with my hair but it was a large chunk of hard earned  money that i just threw away after one week of use, and the money i had to use to purchase the new s.o.s. hair care products. ...tears...</li>
    <li> heard that Nioxin products are very good for your hair</li>
    <li> I have really limp hair and I always see my scalp when I tie up my hair, but this product is amazing! I definitely have so much more volume and it smells really good. Make sure you use it when your hair is slightly damp and not sopping wet/dry and don&#x27;t use too much of it because your hair with get greasy. But because it is so expensive, I only use it for weddings/parties and not on a daily basis. I used all of the nioxin products (shampoos, scalp serums) and this is the best!</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff, and I just bought two more bottles. I usually put hair gel in and try to \\&quot;fluff up\\&quot; my hair a bit, but with this stuff I almost don&#x27;t need hair gel. It really makes my hair full.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is you should brush and blow it out quickly because it can burn a bit if you leave it sitting, since it does contain alchohol. I would try one bottle first and see if your scalp is sensitive to the product. Like I said, I just bought two more bottles!</li>
    <li> It was highly recommended by a beautician, so I was expecting a miracle! I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now, and I haven&#x27;t noticed a big change in my hair, which is very fine and straight.  I haven&#x27;t given up on it; maybe I&#x27;m using it incorrectly. I bought Nioxin Hair Spray and Nioxin Hair Cleanser for Thin Hair (shampoo).  I like them.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen thickener/volumizer products, with various results. There are none that I would recommend, until trying this one. I have thin, fine , color-treated , menopausal hair. This product, applied as directed, has greatly improved the appearance of my hair! It gives me increased volume, thickness,and body, without making my hair feel stiff, or sticky. Yes, it&#x27;s a little more expensive than some of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried, but it has many more favorable reviews than others, and with good reason; it does what it says it will do. Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this product.  It does not help the roots of my hair.  After checking this product out more, I found out it is from Wella products.  I am going back to my Paul Mitchell Root Booster!</li>
    <li> This product performed as it said it would.  I am surprised how much better my hair feels and looks.  It seems to have more body, and has stopped falling out as much as it was.  It is very much more manageable, and I shall continue to use the product.  Would recommend any one try it.</li>
    <li> It is expensive and it doesn&#x27;t do much.  Maybe I will need to use it several times before I see improvement.</li>
    <li> i have thinning hair and this product makes it fuller without being heavy or stickly....i love it!!!</li>
    <li> I use the product sparingly so I acknowledge that I defy instructions.  I find that my hair, which is increasingly fine benefits from the product.  Every body has to make their own cost benefit analysis.  I will use this product increasingly for special events and I am glad I have it on by dresser.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting the advanced Nioxin - wasn&#x27;t paying attention, but the regular Nioxin is fine. It definitely adds body and fullness to your  hair, which is great when you have thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser raved about this product and the price was good.  I don&#x27;t see it really making a big difference.  Will probably not buy again.</li>
    <li> Provides volume for my thin hair without weighing it down...wish it wasn&#x27;t as pricey as it is - but it has lasted me over 3 months now with barely making a dent...</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do so like it for that.  Expensive though considering the size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> While I use Nioxin products religiously, this particular product is not worth the money.  I have used cheap drugstore products that have thickened my fine hair much better.  Nioxin Diamax is okay, at best.</li>
    <li> Love how this product makes my hair look and feels like I ave more volume.  I will order again soon</li>
    <li> Another Nioxin product tha I love and it has been helping my scalp, big time!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, it thickens fine unbodied hair! I would say it is the best product of its type i have used.</li>
    <li> This product has exceeded my expectations.  It makes your hair feel fabulous, look fuller and holds up in humid weather. It has taken the place of my Wella mousse. It&#x27;s a must in hair care!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a couple of weeks now. not really impressed with any results. seems like its alcohol based, but i am not sure. but dont really see any shine or luster with use.</li>
    <li> I feel the same way about the other product I&#x27;ve used it&#x27;s not for me moving on to the next product that does what it says it does</li>
    <li> I could not fix my hair without this product gives it so much volume.</li>
    <li> Great hair thickener!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this. My issue is (was) female pattern baldness in the crown  of my head. I use this about once or twice a week and it has thickened the the hair which gives the appearance of fuller coverage. My first application is when I first wash my hair and then mid-week (I have relaxed hair which i would have NEVER contemplated before b/c my hair was so thin in the crown). I have been using it 6 months and my dermatologist is also testing it in an independent blind study for efficacy. Both the Dr and myself are very pleased with the results achieved. I have been using it in tandem with Flutamide (which supresses testosterone production) to inhibit further hair loss.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product for the cost involved.</li>
    <li> Great product; timely shipping, etc....... 5 stars</li>
    <li> My hairdresser sells this for a lot higher price.  I have the finest hair imaginable.  It is also cut very short.  My hair appears thicker and fuller after one use, but you have to keep applying it for results.  I love this product and am excited that I can continue using it now that I can afford it.</li>
    <li> I did not recieve instructions so looked it up. I have since learned that you only apply to the roots and rub in.  I think it is helping me however I started with Pantene Age Defy for my thinning hair and could tell a huge visual difference with that product.  UPDATE 6/22/13.  This works really well, you have to apply to the roots and it will make any bare spots, less noticeable. I really like it.  I also use Pantene Age Defy thickener, it is amazing.  I alternate with the Nioxin</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any negative comments. It is definitely worth the price. I have &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34; , so it would take a miracle to make it where I would &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it. It has a menthol &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; to it, not the &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; mentioned in a comment.</li>
    <li> I use the three step nioxin products and have found them very effective. This product by nioxin took it to the next level.  My hair has grown from the three step process but this product has given my hair noticeable fulness and my hair feels stronger and thicker. I LOVE this product and don&#x27;t want to ever go without it!</li>
    <li> This product definitely works!  It does not dry or irritate my scalp; although it did a friend of mine who has a very sensitive scalp.  But for me, it&#x27;s my savior when I want fuller looking hair around my hairline.</li>
    <li> I just started using it but  I think it makes my hair somewhat sticky and less shiny and bouncy; whereas when I used the nioxin volumizing reflectives root lifter by itself, I loved that product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Nioxin system products on my baby fine and thinning hair for over 10 years and find they work very well although they do not promote hair regrowth for me. I saw the Diamax in my favorite salon but did not want to spend the $50 just to try it out so I went to Amazon where I got it for less. I&#x27;ve used Diamax as directed many times now in an effort to see if optimal results might be a function of hair cleanliness, amount of product used, etc., but to no avail. It does nothing for improving the texture or styling of my hair. I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Was using Bosley for the same effort - improving the thickness of my hair.  This product works better than those for me.  But it is incredibly expensive unless one really shops around  This supplier sold it to me at a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I got horrible dandruff after using this product , I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all. :( :( :( :(</li>
    <li> My Husband has started trying this with the rest of the line of products they make.  We haven&#x27;t seen and difference.</li>
    <li> Really makes my hair shiny and full.  Love this product.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Never worked , in fact it made my hair worst than before! Save your money! Don&#x27;t buy this it DONT WORK AT ALL!!!</li>
    <li> Works very well,makes hair look thick and full,really fills in the thinning spots.very pleased with this and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I doubt if this product works. it&#x27;s just an oil that makes your hair look thicker. too expensive for the amount of uses required.</li>
    <li> This product gradually builds body in each hair shaft as you spray it on without any stiffness or buildup. You do have to apply liberally, but I find it unique among volumizing products. Note to manufacturer: you need a less clinical-sounding name.</li>
    <li> This smells nice and does not make my scalp itch (I have sensitive skin).  My hair appears thicker and has nice volume when I use it.  When I forget to bring it to my beautician (when I get my hair cut), my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as thick.  I will continue to use this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin products for a year now, at the instigation of my stylist. I&#x27;m 43 and my hair had been thinning fast. I was on the verge of going the full head shave, but decided to try out a stylist I had known as a colleague for several years. I use the activator, the scalp therapy, and Diamax every morning and follow the instructions that he gave me. We have seen a great deal of hair restored and each month there is more hair that is mature and strong growing in places that were formerly bare scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the products work great, it takes some technique that must be followed consistently in order to really work well.&lt;br /&gt;1. First, apply the shampoo to the back of the head, then the sides, then the top back and then top front. The purpose is to apply the shampoo to the areas with the most hair down to the areas with least hair so as to get maximum effect.&lt;br /&gt;2. Do the same with conditioner. *Always* use conditioner. While I&#x27;ve used Nioxin for that, he&#x27;s switched me to another brand while keeping the post wash Nioxin products. It helps to massage the scalp a bit just by holding the fingers steady and moving the scalp around. Stress leads to a stiffening of the muscles, causing more hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;3. Do not rub your hair dry with a towel. Just pat it dry. The towel will pull out hair with vigorous rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply the Nioxin products starting with the Scalp Activating Treatment. Apply about 6 shots of it to various points on the head and rub it into the thinning areas with your fingers. I&#x27;m fairly vigorous with that and I concentrate on areas that are slowest to grow.&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply the foam Scalp Treatment and do the same again, though I use it all around as it works like a light mousse&lt;br /&gt;6. Apply the diamax and rub all around.&lt;br /&gt;7. Using a hair brush with bristles that are about of medium strength, rub it in circles in the areas where hair is thinning - the top of the had basically. I do this until my scalp turns red. That&#x27;s the blood coming to the skin and that will stimulate the follicles. It gets harder each day to reach that redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise, the effects will be amazing for the time invested. The scalp activator can be used again at night along with the brush treatment. For knowing how best to comb/brush your hair, see a stylist. My wife complains that I take longer in the bathroom than she does now, but she doesn&#x27;t complain about how much more hair that I have, and it&#x27;s getting thicker by the day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months.  My hair is getting thicker and the places that were really thin, have now dissappeared.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love this Nioxin. My daughter who is a hair stylist in Beverly Hills told me to buy this for my thinning, breaking hair. It works so well I have told all my friends who are now using it too. My hair looks fab! Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> My hairline was getting noticeably thinner and then I had way too much baby hair coming in. I realized my hair was still falling in chunks.</li>
    <li> This is an item that was recommended on a yahoo article for fine thin hair so decided to try it.  For me it was an average working produt for my hair.  It didn&#x27;t blow me away; I have used other things that work better.  Also this item is not cheap so I was expecting more from it than I actually got.  Its not something I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday in conjunction with the Nioxin shampoo, conditioner, and scalp therapy products.  I&#x27;ve noticed a boost in the thickness of my hair!</li>
    <li> Did not get instructions on its use.  Have not had it long enough to tell if it will be helpful.  Rating might improve in the future but still not sure when and how often to use it for the best advantage.</li>
    <li> I have tried every hair thickening product ever and after reading the reviews on this one, I decided to buy it.  It does NOT work.  Thus far the products that actually work the best for hair thickening are ... Shampoo with Nick Chavez Advanced Plump &#x27;n Thick mixed with Organix Thick &#x27;n Full Biotin &amp; Collagen then use Redken Texture tousle whip 04.  This recipe combination for thicker strands works perfectly for my thin shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Love love love Nioxin products.  This product was needed to use on my hair.  Was pleased with my purchase and will continue to use Nioxin products.</li>
    <li> It works!! I use it every day the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price since is something you are supposed to use daily</li>
    <li> If you have aging hair like I do, tis is the product for you.  I use it when I wash my hair and in between washes,  Really makes my limp hair full.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have thinning hair and it makes my hair feel fuller, more volume.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t notice any thickening so far. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks. I do notice it being greasy when I wake up the next morning though. Be careful and only use three pumps maximum otherwise you&#x27;ll have enough oil to make an omelette by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This product goes on cleanly.  It is not sticky and it increases your hair volume and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My hair is straight and fine and Diamax gave it volume and styling that lasted until next shampoo</li>
    <li> Works well.....immediate results....excellent produc...there was not much hair dropping from the first use.....the product feels great on scalp...very soothing.....I would recommend this product.....</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after a woman I know who works in the beauty business recommended it.  I have long thin hair and really hoped it would work. But, no such luck.  And since it is pretty expensive I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than all the other products out there that I&#x27;ve tried.  Believe me, I have super fine, super thin hair and this does help.  Just don&#x27;t expect miracles. Plus if you use too much, your hair feels &#x27;hard&#x27;.</li>
    <li> is the first time i&#x60;ve used it but so far so good. it doesn&#x60;t damage hair and offers a volume boost.</li>
    <li> Great results! Hair is stronger and healthier. Adds volume without weighing it down.  It doesn&#x27;t interfere with colored hair. I will use it forever!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product and would recommend it to anyone whose hair is thinning, and actually have already told people about it. It has improved my hair, which I thought would be impossible, due to a lengthy illness and more than 25 prescriptions for years and years! I&#x27;m on my second bottle now, and I will use this product for the remainder of my life. I can&#x27;t compare it to any other product because I don&#x27;t know of any product that does anything resembling this. At first application, it visually increased the volume of my hair, but what I didn&#x27;t  know then and learned later was this product filled all the bare spots on my scalp! Wow! Try it yourself.</li>
    <li> I saw this advertised in several magazines, and I wanted to try it. I have been using the Pantene thickener prior to this and it seems to do a better job then the Diamax. This does produce volume and seems to thicken hair as well.  This was also the best price I have seen anywhere on this product, but the Pantene one is cheaper and works better for me.</li>
    <li> Does make hair appear thicker.. I paid a lot more for this at a beauty salon so it&#x27;s the best buy here</li>
    <li> This product used in conjunction with Nioxin System 2 was a bust as well. It was an expensive experiment also.</li>
    <li> This product definitely makes your hair FEEL thicker.  It is no \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product, but I like it enough to buy it again.  It seems to give your hair more body as well.  I think it is a good product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Since this has been advertised in several magazines, I wanted to try it. It does seem to help my fine hair.  This was also the best price I have seen anywhere, even with the shipping cost.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair and recommended it.  The price was a bit steep for me, so I found it here for $20 less and the shipping is free.  It does make my hair fuller and easier to style and works better than other products I have tried.  Does not weigh hair down.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I have gentically thin hair. I tried extentions to make me have thicker hair but everytime I used them my hair was getting thinner from all the breakage. A hair stylist told me about nixion shampoo and conditioner. She said it would thickin up my hair and make it more healthier. I thought it was a little pricey compared to my normal shampoo and conditioner(dove). But I decided to try it. I have been using it for about 5 to 6 weeks now and I am seeing alot of difference in my hair. It is much thicker and healthier. If you decide to use this product think of it this way &amp;#34; You get what you pay for.&amp;#34; I am very happy with this product and decided to order the diamax . I will continue to review on that product as well after 5 to 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I won a bottle of Nioxin Diamx Thickening Xtrafusion Treatment and love it.  It strengthened my hair and I noticed a lot less hair loss after washing my hair.  I use about 5 sprays every time I wash my hair, which is every other day. I&#x27;m buying a bottle now, I don&#x27;t care what it cost. I love this product</li>
    <li> I am a ginger and my hair is the thinnest hair out of everyone I have ever known, and I&#x27;m 31. This product is like a miracle, my hair is easily 100 percent fuller! I saw best results when used on dry hair the next day after washing. I was considering extensions but not anymore!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...  I have very fine hair and this definitely makes it look like I have more hair.</li>
    <li> Nioxin Diamax works really well on my thinning hair. I have fine hair and this product gives it body and it looks fuller after use.  I have been using this for about 6 months and I love how it makes my hair look and feel.  However the cap on the bottle wasn&#x27;t on tight so I ended up with a half full bottle.</li>
    <li> The Nioxin Diamax was recommended by my hairdresser and is perfect for my thinning hair.I am able to style it and it looks like I have thicker hair.</li>
    <li> This is working very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on reviews and didn&#x27;t find it to be as successful as many of the reviewers did.&lt;br /&gt;I used it according to the directions and wasn&#x27;t happy with the residue that was left on my hair. There was a little extra body but not enough to put up with&lt;br /&gt;a product that made my hair feel dirty.</li>
    <li> My hair is not so fine, but it seems a little more fluffy.  My friend used it and she loved it.  She was on medication that thinned her hair.</li>
    <li> not what I was xpecting tho I think it will be affective in the long term.  Was more incline to purchase for imediate results</li>
    <li> I ordered this with very high hopes.  It just really didnt do anything for me, other than coat my hair and make it sticky and weighed-down.  Maybe it will help someone else, but wasn&#x27;t worth the money for me.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is very, very good. It definitely lifted my hair to give it volume.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, and thought I noticed a difference in the thickness of my hair. Have not used it for about 6 months and thought I would try it again.  This time I see no difference.  I have wondered if maybe it was watered down before being sent to me.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I got along with the Nioxin System 2 Start Kit and it only seemed to make it work. I gave it my all - used it for 3 months - and still did nothing.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It really does make your hair feel thicker! 1 bottle lasts almost 2 months. I used to keep my baby fine hair short, but now I can actually wea</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I got this product and started using it how dry my hair felt and looked. I took a look at the label. It turns out it contains ethanol. Ethanol is a drying agent. Stay away from this product if you want healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I did purchase that product with a BIG question if it works. So, I say it DOES. I use 60 days everyday as was recommended. My friends actually started to ask me what do i do my hear. It looks a life even they are third day after shampooing. Well it does work for me. Hope it will for someone else.</li>
    <li> I originally bought Nioxin Diamax from a local hair salon and loved it. I found it is cheaper to purchase it online. It works really well. I have fine thin hair and it helps to &amp;#34;pump up&amp;#34; the strands and make it feel thicker. It also makes your hair feel very silky without the static feeling.</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle and found that it seemed to weigh my hair down too much. I have thin, fine hair.  It thickened the hair somewhat, I believe, but it is just too heavy a product for continued use.  I stopped using this product and just use the shampoo, conditioner, and the serum.  I have had new hair growth with the Nioxin product line so am very pleased overall.  I just didn&#x27;t think this particular product helped a lot,</li>
    <li> Husband swears his hair is thicker and is way more controllable when he uses this.</li>
    <li> good product which works!</li>
    <li> A few months ago I order this product after reading about it in a magazine.  The price was half of what the magazine quoted...and reasonable shipping.  This is my seond order for 3 bottles.</li>
    <li> when i got this product the top of it wouldn&#x27;t even squirt out properly and it looked like someone had already used it before i bought the nioxin shampoo and conditioner and i loved it however this one came packaged so horribly i couldn&#x27;t even get passed that!</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about it. But once I use it it was excellent product and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I wAs surprised at how much more manageable my hair was and how much thicker it appeared.  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> The product delivered what it promised...I do see/feel thicker hair on initial application. Has a money back quanantee on it, but have already purchased 2nd bottle!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!  my hair feels fuller and thicker.</li>
    <li> This product gives the root lift with feeling sticky or tacky. I would recommend this to anyone who deals with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This an an absolutely fantastic temporary hair plumping product. I see reviews from people upset that it hasn&#x27;t grown their hair back or that the thickening effect doesn&#x27;t last longer than a day. It&#x27;s not supposed to. This product has shampoo to shampoo results and is not meant or advertised to grow hair or be permanent. It&#x27;s all for look and feel and if you&#x27;re smart enough to read the bottle you will know this. We carried this product at a high end beauty store I worked at and its absolutely fantastic. we couldn&#x27;t keep it on the shelves. It will make your hair look and feel thicker until your next shampoo. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but hey, that&#x27;s why youre shopping on amazon.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping and perfect product....Great way to do biz</li>
    <li> I am almost in tears right now because I&#x27;m so thankful that I found this product! It has truly saved my life! I bought this serum 2 weeks ago from Amazon. My hair has been falling out (we think from my Mirena) for the last 8 months. At a SHOCKING rate. I used this serum about 6 times. Whenever I wash my hair- not everyday like suggested. I could tell a difference in 2 uses. Yes, I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of dandruff since I started it, but I&#x27;ll take that any day over my balding scalp! I&#x27;m going to post my before and after pics on here for you to see what I&#x27;m talking about. The first pic was of 3 weeks ago (pre-Diamax) and of tonight. This is after 6 uses stretching out over 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine, thin hair and have used the Nioxin products for years. I don&#x27;t seem to lose as much with each washing when I use the shampoo and conditioner. I started using the Diamax late last year. Makes my hair thicker feeling, fuller looking, shinier, and also curls a little better! I don&#x27;t like to go without it!!</li>
    <li> The Nioxin products don&#x27;t work for me.  As a matter of fact, I think they irritate my scalp.  I would recommend asking your doctor or dermatologist before using any product.</li>
    <li> This product gives great results, to thinning hair, producing volume and at the same time&lt;br /&gt;seemed to strengthen the hair as well.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I use the Diamax on casual days when I want volume with a soft casual look. It&#x27;s not sticky like the root lift but it also doesn&#x27;t hold as well either.</li>
    <li> This product is suppose to make you hair appear fuller and thicker....&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t see it. Makes me feel like it makes my hair look dirty</li>
    <li> Love this product - it really works. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Definitely works but you must be patient as it can take a few months.</li>
    <li> Did not help my relaxed thinning area.</li>
    <li> I really like the Nioxin Diamax product. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used it after seeing it avertized on TV. The product leaves your hair feeling fresh and smells great...it does seem to thicken the appearance of my hair and makes styling fun, however, it does leave my hair a little crunchy feeling. I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase again for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this on Amazon after my hairstylist told me how amazing it was (it was $50 in her salon) It didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING. Such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Nioxin Diamax does not work well for me when used together with Nioxin Hair Booster and Nioxin Scalp Treatment.  My hair seems thinner - not thicker - and is difficult to manage.</li>
    <li> This product makes  my fine, thin hair look thick!!  I will not be caught with out using this product. It makes me feel like i have a lot  of hair.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a discernible improvement... not any better than a $5 mousse from the drug store. The bottle is really small and looks slightly bigger than a travel size.  For the price.. it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
    <li> Women who are breast feeding know that they experience hair loss at 3 months. I was devastated with how much my hair was falling out (in the shower and just randomly everywhere).  My hair dresser recommended this product (charged $50 as opposed to the $27.95 shown here) and it worked.  Am I still losing hair? Yes, but it has decreased enough that I don&#x27;t mind that I overpaid.  It is not \\&quot;everywhere\\&quot; now.  It also made my hair feel thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I am also using the Nioxin shampoo (level 1 I believe) and just a generic conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I give it a 4 instead of a 5?  I feel it decreased the hair loss, but not to the level that I was prior to the pregnancy.  Maybe that was too rigid!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck ladies!  It does get better!</li>
    <li> This product was reccomended to use along with the Nioxin 4 Hair Care system I purchased for fine chemically treated hair.  It is easy to use on both wet and dry hair and for me it adds fullness at the same time. I apply before blow drying my hair.  I am very happy that I purchased this too and would reccomend to others</li>
    <li> working good to make my hair seem it has more volume. Got anything that makes hair grow? I used to use Rogain and it stopped working. I need something froom Nioxin to make my hair grow</li>
    <li> After an appointment with a dermatologist on my thinning hair he advised I purchase this product which he described as giving hair the appearance of being fuller.  Having tried a lot of products I was hesitant but this is worth every penny and I will absolutely order more when this bottle is empty.  It REALLY does make your hair look and feel fuller.  A few small pumps every morning directly on my thin part has really worked.  I have naturally curly hair and put this on before styling both curly and straight.  It does not weigh down the curls or frizz them out.  When I have straightened my hair with this product on people thought I had a keratin treatment because it was full and shiny.  I highly recommend if you have thinning hair.</li>
