      <li>I like this, styles hair nice.</li>
      <li>Healthy, smoothe, styled, and cute!</li>
      <li>Love the texture it provides</li>
      <li>My stylist recommended this product last month, and I have been very happy with it.</li>
      <li>The hardest part of my boyfriend finding a styling cream (one that isn&#x27;t wax and doesn&#x27;t make his hair crunchy) is that most of them are meant for women.  </li>
      <li>Okay, so my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl or volume well at all.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the smell, which is not &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; at all!</li>
      <li>Magic.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length, frizzy, damaged, medium curly blond hair and am always looking for the next best product.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it works great on my wild hair:)</li>
      <li>my hair stylist suggested i try this to boost my fine, lifeless hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic and is creamy and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply, as a nice subtle scent and very effective for my too-silky hair.  </li>
      <li>This hear product is fabulous.</li>
      <li>This is a great product (actually recommended by the hair stylist) that holds, reduces frizzies, and doesn&#x27;t smell like some tropical island.  </li>
      <li>I curl my hair daily with a wand, this cream gives great hold and separation.  </li>
      <li>Even better, it smells good enough that I use it on high humidity days, which in DC is all of the time. :)</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and straight and does not respond well to styling at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used many products over the years and this one is, by far, my favorite.  </li>
      <li>My hair dresser suggested this for my curls and she was right!</li>
      <li>I have had numerous instances where people tell me that I smell good and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome, it almost changes the texture of your hair to be more pliable and you only need a little bit if you&#x27;re a guy.</li>
      <li>I was actually pretty excited about using this product because of how it smells.</li>
      <li>Aside from the fact that it smells amazing, it gives me a completely different head of hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
      <li>Besides the fact that Catwalk styling cream tames my wavy, frizzy hair in a way that no other product does, it smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>Right off the get-go, I loved this styling cream for a few reasons.</li>
      <li>It has consistent results in both</li>
      <li>Really helps my volume!</li>
      <li>Has a good smell and firm hold.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many styling products, but my hair still fell flat.</li>
      <li>I use this in conjunction with a blow dryer or flat iron and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before,</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much and a tube lasts quite a while.  </li>
      <li>and it works REALLY well.</li>
      <li>I love it and am planning on trying the other products in this line as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i highly recommend tigi catwalk session series styling cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more of this in the near future!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m honestly not to crazy about it, I normally use a different product but thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and extremely pliable....</li>
      <li>When I dry my hair a few minutes later it does a great job of holding my style.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly curly hair!</li>
      <li>It gives my hair a little grit for styling, which I find very useful.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too feminine or too masculine...</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and use this after I wash my hair.</li>
      <li>They are always surprised when I tell them it&#x27;s my hair...</li>
      <li>/&gt;it is the only hair product you really need.</li>
      <li>Also revives/ tames day old curls after I&#x27;ve slept on them.</li>
      <li>You only need about a nickle size drop, rub it with your fingers and into your damp hair, comb it through, blowdry, comb again, curl, roll your curls up and pin them in place using some 1 3/4 inch single prong pinch hair clips, let all your rolls cool,</li>
      <li>I first started using it in the dry heat of Arizona.  </li>
      <li>I usually stick to a light hold gel or mouse because I like to have soft, natural curls without a crunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a major</li>
      <li>I bought a similar Pantene product and it has nowhere near the hold Tigi does.</li>
      <li>Which is really frustrating because I love curling my hair and doing faux victory rolls (the 1940&#x27;s hairstyles).</li>

<li> Which is really frustrating because I love curling my hair and doing faux victory rolls (the 1940&#x27;s hairstyles).</li>
<li> It definitely adds thickness and texture to my flat, lifeless hair, and it has just enough hold to keep my part in place.</li>
<li> Does not dry your hair out like some other products.</li>
<li> Then I dry it with a diffuser.</li>
<li> try.&lt;br /&gt;typically, products either weigh my hair down and make it look gross or don&#x27;t seem to make any sort of difference.&lt;br</li>
<li> Seeing that Amazon sells it for half the price of my local salon makes me even happier.</li>
<li> I actually prefer just rubbing in a small amount after towel-drying my hair rather than blow drying it in, but your hair may react differently.</li>
<li> extraordinary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after applying a quarter-ish sized amount to wet hair and blow drying with a large round brush, my hair feels at least twice as thick!&lt;br /&gt;it makes my hair smoother, easier to style and just plain prettier for the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I put it in my hair while it&#x27;s wet, comb it into place, then put on makeup, etc.</li>
<li> hairspray, let it dry, let the curls down and style.</li>
<li> Out all the hair products I&#x27;ve used in the past (hairsprays, gels, etc.), this is the only one I&#x27;ve</li>
<li> With wet hair, I put about a quarter-sized dollop in the palm of my hand, rub my hands together and work it into the bottom half of my hair</li>
<li> , if you have a hard time getting your hair to hold curl (or even basic volume), this is the product you want to use.</li>
<li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product, but it&#x27;s no replacement for Tigi MasterMind which is no longer available.</li>
<li> I wish it were less &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; when it dries in my hair.  </li>
<li> The cream is not too heavy or sticky so it doesn&#x27;t weigh the curls down.</li>
<li> It holds up very well throughout the day and never gets oily or dirty.</li>
<li> My stylist recommended this product after cutting my hair short.</li>
<li> And when it dries it gets all frizzy and crazy and just.. Not cute.</li>
<li> /&gt;i was skeptical but decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve even tried the expensive products that you can find in salons.</li>
<li> FAIL!</li>

    <li> my hair stylist suggested i try this to boost my fine, lifeless hair.&lt;br /&gt;i was skeptical but decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.&lt;br /&gt;typically, products either weigh my hair down and make it look gross or don&#x27;t seem to make any sort of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then i used this styling cream.&lt;br /&gt;the results are extraordinary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after applying a quarter-ish sized amount to wet hair and blow drying with a large round brush, my hair feels at least twice as thick!&lt;br /&gt;it makes my hair smoother, easier to style and just plain prettier for the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend tigi catwalk session series styling cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is the only hair product you really need.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly curly hair! And when it dries it gets all frizzy and crazy and just.. Not cute. My hair dresser suggested this for my curls and she was right! Aside from the fact that it smells amazing, it gives me a completely different head of hair. Healthy, smoothe, styled, and cute! I will definitely be buying more of this in the near future!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years. I have naturally curly hair and use this after I wash my hair. Then I dry it with a diffuser. The cream is not too heavy or sticky so it doesn&#x27;t weigh the curls down. Also, the price on Amazon is about a third of what it is in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years.  I have short hair and I style it by towel drying, adding product...then styling with my fingers.  I first started using it in the dry heat of Arizona.  Now I use it in humid Florida.  It has consistent results in both environments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many products over the years and this one is, by far, my favorite.  It has great hold without feeling sticky, greasy or like glue.  The smell isn&#x27;t too feminine or too masculine...it&#x27;s just right.  I have had numerous instances where people tell me that I smell good and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  They are always surprised when I tell them it&#x27;s my hair...then I have to prove it by letting them smell my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great and not gooey.</li>
    <li> Really helps my volume!</li>
    <li> Great product at a fantastic price</li>
    <li> Keeps my curls in check.</li>
    <li> great product will reorder</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff and so do I.  It smells amazing and lasts all day</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product, but it&#x27;s no replacement for Tigi MasterMind which is no longer available. I&#x27;ve been searching for a replacement and I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
    <li> Best styling cream, and people who hug me always remark on how good I smell (I love the smell too- I can&#x27;t wear perfume or scented lotions, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I love it and I love being told I smell great!).  I curl my hair daily with a wand, this cream gives great hold and separation.  Also revives/ tames day old curls after I&#x27;ve slept on them.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, it almost changes the texture of your hair to be more pliable and you only need a little bit if you&#x27;re a guy. I use this in conjunction with a blow dryer or flat iron and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before, if you&#x27;re looking for moderate control without the gross sticky buildup from hair spray and waxes then this is for you. It&#x27;s light and extremely pliable....SCIENCE. lol</li>
    <li> Great products.  I use them exclusively</li>
    <li> This hear product is fabulous. I really enjoy the smell, which is not &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; at all! It gives my hair a little grit for styling, which I find very useful.</li>
    <li> Love the texture it provides</li>
    <li> This Product is AMAZING!! i use it when i do headband curls and it keeps the curls all day while not making my hair crunchy or sticky and adding great volume. I will never use another styling cream or gel!</li>
    <li> Okay, so my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl or volume well at all. I&#x27;ve tried so many styling products, but my hair still fell flat. Which is really frustrating because I love curling my hair and doing faux victory rolls (the 1940&#x27;s hairstyles). I&#x27;ve even tried the expensive products that you can find in salons. FAIL! So I tried this and it works REALLY well. Like, AMAZINGLY well. Magic. I love it! I&#x27;m going to beauty school later this year, and I&#x27;m going to recommend this product to my clients. It also smells really good. I was actually pretty excited about using this product because of how it smells. It&#x27;s quite exceptional. It&#x27;s a major bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have a hard time getting your hair to hold curl (or even basic volume), this is the product you want to use. You only need about a nickle size drop, rub it with your fingers and into your damp hair, comb it through, blowdry, comb again, curl, roll your curls up and pin them in place using some 1 3/4 inch single prong pinch hair clips, let all your rolls cool, hairspray, let it dry, let the curls down and style.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works great on my wild hair:)</li>
    <li> Holds style well without being sticky or goopy.  It has a pleasant smell that is neither too manly nor too feminine. Glad I found it!</li>
    <li> Has a good smell and firm hold.  I wish it were less &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; when it dries in my hair.  Was looking for a replacement for Redken&#x27;s &amp;#34;Get Groomed&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The hardest part of my boyfriend finding a styling cream (one that isn&#x27;t wax and doesn&#x27;t make his hair crunchy) is that most of them are meant for women.  This is a great product (actually recommended by the hair stylist) that holds, reduces frizzies, and doesn&#x27;t smell like some tropical island.  Even better, it smells good enough that I use it on high humidity days, which in DC is all of the time. :)</li>
    <li> All of the catwalk products work great!</li>
    <li> Out all the hair products I&#x27;ve used in the past (hairsprays, gels, etc.), this is the only one I&#x27;ve liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff, especially for men.</li>
    <li> I like this, styles hair nice. Non sticky</li>
    <li> As a guy, I have always been apprehensive about using hair products. My hair is very fine and straight and does not respond well to styling at all. I have always stayed away from hairspray and gels for fear that they would leave my hair greasy or brittle. My stylist recommended this product last month, and I have been very happy with it. It definitely adds thickness and texture to my flat, lifeless hair, and it has just enough hold to keep my part in place. It holds up very well throughout the day and never gets oily or dirty. I actually prefer just rubbing in a small amount after towel-drying my hair rather than blow drying it in, but your hair may react differently. I&#x27;ll definitely be adding this to my regular shopping list. Seeing that Amazon sells it for half the price of my local salon makes me even happier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m honestly not to crazy about it, I normally use a different product but thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product ever!  You don&#x27;t need much and a tube lasts quite a while.  Very easy to apply, as a nice subtle scent and very effective for my too-silky hair.  Does not dry your hair out like some other products.</li>

I put it in my hair while it&#x27;s wet, comb it into place, then put on makeup, etc. When I dry my hair a few minutes later it does a great job of holding my style. I bought a similar Pantene product and it has nowhere near the hold Tigi does.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, frizzy, damaged, medium curly blond hair and am always looking for the next best product. I usually stick to a light hold gel or mouse because I like to have soft, natural curls without a crunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Right off the get-go, I loved this styling cream for a few reasons. It smells fantastic and is creamy and easy to apply. With wet hair, I put about a quarter-sized dollop in the palm of my hand, rub my hands together and work it into the bottom half of my hair (I stay away from my roots so I don&#x27;t add any extra oils). It helps with frizz and keeps my curls styled the way I want them to all day. I love it and am planning on trying the other products in this line as well. Hopefully, the rest will smell just as good :).</li>
    <li> Besides the fact that Catwalk styling cream tames my wavy, frizzy hair in a way that no other product does, it smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> O M G...... This product is great and the smell is to die for it has an amazing smell which makes it better. It holds hair in place and kills frizzy hair.</li>
