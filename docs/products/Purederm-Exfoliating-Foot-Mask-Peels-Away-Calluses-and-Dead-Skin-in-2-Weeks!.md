<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just did the treatment yesterday. The boots felt great can&#x27;t wait to see the results in the next couple of days</li>
    <li> This stuff works a little better for me than Babyfoot, and it&#x27;s SOOOOOOOO much cheaper!! I will be buying only this from now on.</li>
    <li> Took 2+ weeks to arrive from South Korea which was frankly disappointing, however I am pleased with the results from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t know why reviewers tell you to soak your feet before using - it doesn&#x27;t tell you to do that on the package at all. My wide, size 10 (woman&#x27;s) foot just, just fit in the booties. I didn&#x27;t understand from other reviews that there was an additional layer inside the booties (felt like the material dryer sheets are made from) that should mold/shape around your tootsies and up the sides of your feet, then the plastic booties keep all the goo in. Not suitable for walking around either, so RELAX. My feet felt cold the whole time and itchy/stinging but those of us who go thru hair-highlighting and facial scrubs know the drill. The wait was worth it. My feet haven&#x27;t felt this good in a very long time. Glad I got the 3-pack for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So product 4 stars, delivery 3 stars I suppose.</li>
    <li> I used all three packages in 3 months. I love it,because it peeled my skin after3 days,and after 10 days my feet was totally peeled. good quality</li>
    <li> It took about 3 weeks for my skin to peel.  But it is just as good as Baby Foot. The price is excellent and you get three in a pack.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as a cheaper alternative to Baby Foot. Big mistake. The liquid/gel in these is a lot runnier than Baby Foot and the plastic seams on the booties rip very easily. Not a good combo. Found that my feet peeled some, but not even close to the full exfoliation experienced when using the real deal. Save your money and get one good set, rather than 3 mediocre sets.</li>
    <li> Bought this bc it was cheaper than Baby Foot Easy Pack 2 x 35ml, 1box English Version, but, as you know, you get what you pay for.  This one had 3 treatments unlike Baby Foot Easy Pack 2 x 35ml, 1box English Version which had one and it was expensive, but, I found it to be better.&lt;br /&gt;The peeling was more even, this product wasn&#x27;t and I am still waiting for my heels, which really needed to peel, have yet to do so.  The baby foot product is thicker and the boots have adhesive tabs to help them stay on, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;So I am going back to Baby Foot and will give the 2 other treatments away.  Don&#x27;t want to waste my time.  Oh, and you have to keep it on longer 60-90 mins vs max 60 for BF.</li>
    <li> I wore these per instructions.  Forgot about my feet but days later they began to peel and peel.  Skin where it peeled was smooth.  However, it did not remove callouses.</li>
    <li> It works, but it&#x27;s kind of scary. You need to be prepared for how long it takes for the peeling and then how long before it stops. Also, you need to be careful to avoid exposing your non-callus feet and surrounding skin to the solution - something hard to avoid when you are wearing the booties.</li>
    <li> I used Baby Foot and loved it. Based on the reviews here I tried this one to save some money.  My feet never peeled! It&#x27;s been 2.5 weeks and they&#x27;re still dry and gross as ever. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This works just as good as Babyfoot.....So happy to find a cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> Followed directions and it has been 8 days and nothing.  Very disappointed in this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this foot peel. Your whole foot will peak off and leave your feet feeling baby soft</li>
    <li> At first I thought this didn&#x27;t work BUT after 2 weeks I finally saw the peeling of skin.  Funny thing is I too first noticed it in yoga class when a bunch of skin fell off onto my mat.  Yuk!  But I went home and moisturized, pulled on some socks and let the rest of the skin fall off my feet.  Yes, this does work but you must wait about 2 weeks to see results.  It&#x27;s been a week and I still see some peeling so I will put on a foot moisturizing mask ( Missha sells a good moisturizing booty ) and in the next few days see baby smooth feet.</li>
    <li> It does it work quite well.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, the first night you will feel your feets incredibly soft. After 2-4 days you will start to notice your feet skin peeling. It acts really fast and you don&#x27;t experience any pain. It removes any impurity from your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend. I&#x27;m size 10 men and worked fine.</li>
    <li> I would give these a Five Star having used the more expensive Baby Feet prior to these on my feet&lt;br /&gt; BUT....&lt;br /&gt;They worked fine for me but I could not get these on to my husband&#x27;s size 12 feet.&lt;br /&gt; I had to give myself another soak since I already cut them open.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything they said it would for me.&lt;br /&gt;It felt good with them on and I wore them an hour but didn&#x27;t take off callus as staed they would .</li>
    <li> really enjoyed it will be ordering more</li>
    <li> I think the product works really well the only downfall is the plastic boot unfortunately I had a tough time and the bags ripped because I have an 11 to 12 womens size foot other brands that I have tried their boots fit. If you have smaller feet this would work awesome</li>
    <li> I am a die hard fan of baby foot, but this junk right here??? Amazing!!! You can wear it longer than baby foot, it comes in three packs instead of one, it&#x27;s cheaper, and The results for me were a whole lot quicker. My only negative is that after you wear the booties my feet became freezing for the next two hours, but that is a side affect I am willing to risk.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product...I liked that I got 3 packs for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over a week and nothing has happened?  I tried it again and still nothing.  Waste of money.  I&#x27;ll buy babyfeet.  It worked right away.</li>
    <li> Bought this assuming it would not work since it was Iess expensive than the BabyFeet product that&#x27;s getting rave reviews. I was WRONG! This product works great! Noticed some drying, flaking on day 4. By end of a full week my feet were soft and pretty again. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> item as described, thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this for mask because it&#x27;s cheaper than the $25 top brand and I&#x27;m happy that I did. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working at all, in fact I was planning on doing another one because I found out through other reviews that you shouldn&#x27;t use much moisturizer and here I was slather moisturizer everyday after soaking my feet everyday, so I thought I really messed the process up. So on day 6 I got out another for mask, started soaking my feet first for the prep, pulled my feet out of my for soak and voila, just like that my feet started shedding big chunks of skin. It was a grotesque yet beautiful site to see. I did cheat and spent the next hour with my ped egg helping the process along and when I was done my feet felt and looked like a babies bottom... I&#x27;m not exaggerating. I keep feeling my feet, rubbing them together, and looking at them because I&#x27;ve never seen them looking so nice. I&#x27;m obsessed and now I know to keep this product on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate all callouses but removed significant amount of dead skin within one week. chose this because baby foot is a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Shipped very slow.&lt;br /&gt;My foot started to peel in 4 days and now it has been almost 2 weeks and still peeking.&lt;br /&gt;They are soft and almost done peeling.</li>
    <li> This is as good as Babyfoot, but cheaper.</li>
    <li> It softened my feet but they did not peel. AT ALL! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> At the doctors office because my feet are dry cracked and have patches of skin falling off Consistently since I last used it about 6 weeks ago</li>
    <li> Worked absolutely great!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  only sent one treatment even though I purchased 3.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first but these things work! After using them, a few days later my feet started shedding like a snake. I will definitely be buying several more.</li>
    <li> It definitely did something. I peeled and my callouses are much better but not gone yet. I&#x27;m going to try a second run this week (6 weeks after the 1st) and i&#x27;ll add to this if it makes a noticeable change.</li>
    <li> I got one of these kits for my daughter and it worked wonders on her thick callused feet. Although I didn&#x27;t think my feet were bad because I scrub them daily in the shower, I tried it as well.  For the first five days, nothing.  I was smugly thinking that I don&#x27;t need a foot mask because my feet were fine.  This morning I showered as usual. When I came out and was getting dressed, lotioning my feet, I noticed some dry looking patches on my heels.  Started rubbing and oh my gosh!  Dead skin was literally sloughing off my heels, the bottoms of my feet, and even along the sides!  Got back in the shower and spent 10 minutes with a foot scrubber, getting all the dead, peeling skin off my feet. Lesson learned...even though my feet didn&#x27;t have cracked, dry calluses, there was still an accumulation of dead skin that was waiting to be removed.  One caveat - the plastic booties are a bit small.  I have fat feet which made getting them into the small opening tough. I had to cut the top and then used tape to secure them onto my feet for the 60 minutes they have to stay on.</li>
    <li> I had some girl friends talking about foot masks and they recommended the TonyMoly, I tried it and didn&#x27;t recognize anything happening, so I found the Purederm 3 pack was the same as 1 TonyMoly so I decided to try again. I did it last weekend and I put some loose socks over the top of the plastic booties to keep the solution closer to my feet and sat for a couple hours. 5 days later my feet are peeling wonderfully! It&#x27;s awesome and I recommend 100%!!</li>
    <li> Ingredients are not natural, in fact, concerning.  Do your research prior to purchasing.  I sent it back once in receipt and reall ALL ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is nothing like the other product Baby Foot. My feet haven&#x27;t began to peel, at all, after 9 days of applying. Probably due to the size of the booties ... if you have larger feet, they won&#x27;t fit in as nicely as with Baby Foot. Guess this is a prime example of the old saying, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;. Spend the extra $$ and buy Baby Foot instead.</li>
    <li> Ok- I have used 2 1 week apart, and my feet have peeled, but not the thick heel part.  I am going to try a third peel today, as it is 2 weeks after the last one, and see how it goes.  Disappointed sofar, but hopeful.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  30 years of callused,cracked heels gone after using this product. It took all three treatments for my feet, but my feet were tough and so callused and had been for for so many years, I have never even had a pedicure because I was embarassed of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truly amazed at how great my feet look now. My husband was so impressed, that he&#x27;s going to try it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet are finally sandal worthy! :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on Baby Feet. This product works identically and a much better value. I&#x27;ve used both, there is no difference. Great product, Amazon Prime and seller even threw in some samples of face masks. Will definitely buy again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff was amazing.  It took off the entire outer layer of skin from my feet, including the cuticles of my toenails.  No pain or anything.  Started on day 5 and took probably 5 days to completely slough off the old skin.  I have very pretty feet now!</li>
    <li> I was a total skeptic, but I bought them &amp; tried anyway. After about 3 days still nothing &amp; I said to myself &amp;#34;I knew it!&amp;#34;. Then came day 4...holy crap!! My old cracked dried out skin started slugging off &amp; revealing beautiful skin!! I&#x27;m a total convert &amp; will be buying these on a regular basis!!!</li>
    <li> Just yesterday tried the treatment. Felt great! Product caution: wear gloves when handling packet contents. Otherwise, so far so good! Let&#x27;s wait and see the results...</li>
    <li> I bought a 3-pack for about $11.00 hoping it would give similar results to the $25.00 single-pack &amp;#34;Baby Foot&amp;#34; version.  I haven&#x27;t tried the the more expensive brand, but I am happy with this product.  It works just like it&#x27;s supposed to.  I had very thick callouses on my heels, so it didn&#x27;t all come off with the first try.  After about 5 days my feet started peeling.  My heels felt like if I rubbed them, the callous would rub off, but I didn&#x27;t because so many people say not to mess with the process.  A week after the first time, I used the second pack.  And again had some peeling after about 4-5 days.  At that point I took a washcloth in the shower and rubbed at my rough heels.  The thick callouses just wiped away easily.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  The thicker callouses won&#x27;t just peel away on their own, but they are extremely softened by the process.  Give it some time and then gently use a washcloth.  I&#x27;m thrilled, and will keep this product on hand.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. $is great.</li>
    <li> Works exactly like Baby Foot.  Will buy again for light exfoliation, does not take away heavier calluses though.  6 1/2 women. This is standard size, up to men 11 at a guess.  It does come in extra large size elsewhere.  3 pairs for $8+ is a very good price.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says. Probably more drastic a treatment than I needed, but certainly effective.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good a Baby Feet. Will give a mild peel, but not very effective really.</li>
    <li> Does NOT work. I&#x27;ve tried babyfoot in the past &amp; it worked beautifully, I thought I got lucky by finding this buy for so cheap but it&#x27;s really a waste. Your better off buying the babyfoot brand. It&#x27;s worth the extra $10-$15 bucks!</li>
    <li> After 4 days both feet started peeling and peeling and peeling...couldn&#x27;t wear flip flops or sandals out to in public because feet were kind of gross. Had to sleep with socks on to prevent peeling skin from getting all over bed. Once process completed feet were baby soft and smooth. Next time will do in the fall or winter!!</li>
    <li> This works pretty good I just needed to lightly exfoliate at the end of the two weeks and my feet were like baby feet.</li>
    <li> Worked ok. I thought is wasn&#x27;t working as it took 5-7 days to start to peel.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  It can compare to baby feet.  It peels a layer off of the top and bottom of your feet after about a week, leaving them soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great results.  I was very pleased with this product.  I received great value - effective at a much lower cost than the &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> This works well. Such a messy process but well worth it.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to work at all. I followed the directions, but didn&#x27;t experience any peeling at all. No noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Works, but not as good as BabyFoot. It is way less expensive than BabyFoot (which is about $20/1 treatment (2 booties)). You must soak your feet for at least an hour. Then wear the solution-filled footies for at least 60 minutes. I wear them for 90 minutes.  It takes me 5 days and then the dead skin peels off. It&#x27;s best to soak your feet in water each day after your treatment if  want them to peel quicker.</li>
    <li> It took about a week for the dead skin to fall off.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant on how these would work after reading the reviews but I figured I would try them since a pack of 3 was cheaper than the baby feet brand. After about 5 days from using the mask my feet became very dry, rough, and flakey with minimal peeling. I was afraid the mask was going to be a bust so I decided to help it along. After taking showers I would rub my feet with the towel which helped some of the skin flake off. I also used a pumice stone the one day. After about 10 days my feet are definitely much smoother then before. I only have 2 small callouses left. I am hoping with subsequent treatments they will be completely gone. I am not sure if I would have gotten the same results without a little extra effort on my part but it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m back to revise my review. Day 5 the peeling has started. I am getting the results I wanted on the bottom of my foot. Here are some thoughts: 1. Next time I will not soak my feet before. I think that if your feet are waterlogged they will absorb less of the acid. 2. Next time I will find something to protect the top of my feet first (perhaps a petroleum jelly barrier? 3. I would like there to be some kind of way to close up the bag but I put large socks over them to keep them on for an hour. I am holding only one star back for these. All-in-all it&#x27;s a great product that gives the results I can&#x27;t get from exfoliating no matter how hard I try.   ***************** I used this product 4 days ago. So far nothing on the bottom of my foot where I wanted results. The thing is, that there was no way to keep the acid from the top of my foot where skin was soft. Anyway, about a day later, sores developed on the top of my foot. I&#x27;ve been treating them with antibiotic ointment. Would be nice if at least I had some peeling from the bottom in the next few days but so far no sign of that happening. What really frustrated me was the response from the seller. Kind of an, &amp;#34;oh well so sorry too bad have a nice day.&amp;#34; Very frustrating.  Here is the email string...  Hi.. I am Bred at Hisister. We are sorry for the items not to be helpful to you.;; Have a good day&#x60;  --- Original message ---  I applied an application on Sunday. So far nothing has happened on the bottom of my foot where I need peeling, but I&#x27;ve developed a few sores on the top of my foot where the skin was already soft. So at this time I can&#x27;t provide positive feedback.

    <li> I regret buying a three pack. I&#x27;ve always had dry scaly feet and heard about Baby foot from one of my clients. This foot mask had similar reviews and cost about 1/3 the price so why not try it? I was tired of having to use my PedEgg to have nice feet for a few days. Well after reading all the info I could and the description mentioning so many natural good ingredients I was rather irked that it reeked of alcohol and chemicals. The design is greatly flawed in that the booties cover the tops of the feet. This wretched beastie ruined my toe nails (they were painted and it ATE through the polish and made them cracked and brittle) They peeled for around 5 days as expected it was like a sunburn on steroids. Yes gross that is ALOT of dead skin flaking off but that was what its supposed to do. My feet are not sensitive but by day two of peeling they were so dry they hurt big time so I rubbed coconut oil on them and this help greatly and didn&#x27;t effect the peeling. Buy day three I was barely keeping my picking habit in check and only touched my feet in the shower to wash them and put more oil on after. After day five there was no more peeling and I ripped off my socks to find my feet...in the same condition they were in before I started the whole mess. Waste of time and money. Tortured my poor feet for no good reason. I plan on using my PedEgg more often instead and save myself the trouble. Less mess and I don&#x27;t have to wear socks 24/7</li>
    <li> AMAZING! This is the best foot care product I have ever purchased. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked and have recommended it already to several friends! I&#x27;ll be buying this more regularly for sure!</li>
    <li> I started using this product Aug.19. Nothing began to happen until today. I soaked my feet in Epsom salt &amp; alcohol (small amount of both) for about 35-40 minutes. As I was soaking my feet, I began to see the water getting cloudy. Took my foot out the tub and seen the dead skin beganing to peel off (day 1 of peel Aug. 23). I know that if this is just day 1 of peel I can only imagine what next week peeling will look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of dead skin build up on my feet, and was starting to think I would need to use a 2nd foot mask to get the ball rolling. After today I see that one is all I need for now. The product arrived a day before it was suppose to and was nicely packaged. I will be ordering more of these (for friends and family). I will do another update in a week or so. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!:)</li>
    <li> This product really works.My feet are so soft. I&#x27;m not sure why some of the bad reviews on here, cause I had great results. I left the socks on for 70 minutes rinsed and dried on April 24th. I had been wearing socks and shoes waiting for something to happen. On April 28th took socks off and foot had a big section starting to peel. May 1st the bottom foot peeling is almost done I see the top of my foot will have some shedding as well but that will take a bit longer. My feet had some callouses and in need of some care. I use a pumice stone in the shower and will throw it out after using this mask. Even my little toes with corns on them are virtually gone and that has never happened in decades. My friend did the mask the same day as me and May 1st was the first day for her to have some of the peeling happen. She wore sandals during here waiting period. I think you need  patience&#x27;s. I think the thicker the callous the longer it takes for the mask to work. During my waiting period I could also feel a cooling sensation on my feet, kinda like having soaked my feet in tee tree oil or mint leaves. I thought having this sensation on my feet was a good thing meaning the mask was working...and it was. The price is so worth the results and I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> Thick skin peeling away fourteen days later. The new skin feels so soft. I just purchased two more Foot Mask orders.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!!! Started peeling in a few days..</li>
    <li> These actually work. It has only been five days, and almost all of my dead skin is gone. I will never have to spend hours pumicing my feet again, thank you sweet baby Jesus.</li>
    <li> If you have BIG FEET DO NOT BUY 😡</li>
    <li> It did minor exfoliating.  I was hoping for a deeper exfoliation as my heels are pretty bad.  But this would probably be good for maintenance.</li>
    <li> First product that actually works!</li>
    <li> It worked on day three it started peeling.  I still have some rough spots and I&#x27;m going to try another treatment next month.  Overall for the price I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot will buy again</li>
    <li> I have used Baby Foot in the past with good results.  This works exactly the same on my feat at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> great buy, great service</li>
    <li> Did not work as the picture showed.  Was I to use all three treatments?  Spaced how far apart.  Not sure that I would reorder.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Took 7 days to start peeling but when it started it went on for 3-4 days. My feet were super soft afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have used 2 of the 3 sets I purchased.  1st use, virtually no peeling.  2nd use a little bit of peeling.  Stinks this didn&#x27;t work for me.  I was hoping to have nice looking feet without going to a salon.</li>
    <li> WRITTEN WHILE WEARING SOCKS -&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased this product. I have also used Baby Foot. The information I have to share is a comparison:&lt;br /&gt;1) The plastic sock is not the same quality. It is thinner and a different material. 2) It doesn&#x27;t have the adhesives so you have to tape it yourself. 3) My foot is a size 6, and I have about an inch extra space in front and in back. It would not work for a man with large feet, but Baby Foot is a much larger sock.  2) The cloth inside is thin compared to Baby Foot. 3) There is not as much gel inside as Baby Foot. 4) Some spots of my ankle feel slightly stingy, and I didn&#x27;t feel that until 60 minutes passed with Baby Foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all the above, the product is significantly less expensive and nothing so far would prevent me from purchasing Purederm again. Even my husband could fit into this sock;  he wears a size 10 and has a thin foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;90 MINUTES LATER -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to wear the Purederm for 90 minutes. My feet got that cool feel that I got with Baby Foot, and the stingy feeling went away after a few minutes. I was not able to go the full 90 minutes with Baby Foot, because my feet started feel that stingy feeling when your skin has had enough. The Purederm was easier to clean off my feet because the liquid wasn&#x27;t a gel like Baby Foot. I don&#x27;t know that this matters.Some may say the gel holds to the feet better. I stated earlier that there was less gel or liquid, but that didn&#x27;t seem to affect the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this product I was nervous because of some of the comments. I cannot see any difference at this point from the use of either product, i.e., my toenails didn&#x27;t turn white like one other person stated. At this point I would say that both products work equally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will write further information when my feet peel. My feet do have an extreme amount of callus and Baby Foot didn&#x27;t get rid of the part on my heels, which disappointed me. However it made my feet look great everywhere else and did remove some of the heel callus. This time I prepared better and filed my heel down as far as I could. I also soaked my feet for 20-30 minutes and then scraped dead skin from my heels with my fingernails. I hope that helps this product to break through my tough callus. More later...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MONTH LATER -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet are a little drier with this, so I just use a cream. I am using my second one today. I will purchase this product again.feet look great everywhere else and did remove some of the heel callus. This time I prepared better and filed my heel down as far as I could.

    <li> This works just as well as the more expensive brands! Don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s not working, just give it about a week and the skin will begin peeling.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with these. I used to work a job that kept me on my feet all day. I developed calluses and dry scaly areas on my feet that did not go away even 2 years after I left that job. The only other method I tried before these was the pedegg and it really didn&#x27;t do much of anything. These got rid of 90% of the rough spots in 1 application. There were a few stubborn areas that remained dry and scaly but I used an electronic foot file on those spots and then the Purederm Ultra Repairing Foot Mask. My feet are super smooth now! It took about 2 weeks total for my feet to peel and then stop flaking. Different people react differently to this product. I have bought these for 3 other people. Some has their dead skin flake off in little pieces, mine pretty much peeled of in sheets. Everyone noticed a significant improvement.</li>
    <li> It works. Maybe not after mask #1, but if you do it again a week later. I am a woman with stubborn gross man callouses. My feet are just embarrassing. This did work though, as most have said. My feet were also softer.&lt;br /&gt;They just went back to normal pretty fast. Maybe I needed to keep doing it and over time they would improve more permanently?&lt;br /&gt;I might spend the $ to find out....</li>
    <li> I know I left a review from my previous purchase of this product, but here I am, leaving another one!  The key to get these things to work is to keep your feet moisturized after you wear the booties. Soak your feet before you wear them, soak your feet in them for around 90 minutes, wash your feet or soak them really well afterward. A few hours later, put some moisturizer on your feet or soak them in water again. Throughout the following week, if you either put moisturizer on every few hours or soak your feet every few hours (taking a shower counts as soaking your feet in this scenario), then you should see way more progress than if you just try on the booties and never do anything with your feet again the rest of the week.  Note: It&#x27;s very helpful to wear socks during this period, as it keeps the moisture locked in for longer, and keeps the skin flakes from going everywhere.   Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried it both ways - just wearing the booties and letting my feet be, which barely removed anything; and wearing the booties, moisturizing and soaking my feet for a week afterwards, which got off a HUGE amount of dead skin.   In regards to the size, which I see a lot of people complaining about - I have size 8 1/2 feet (sometimes I fit in a size 9 shoe), and the booties fit with a bit of room to spare. I&#x27;d say if you wear a size 10 shoe you could JUST fit in the regular size booties. It&#x27;s important to note that the booties aren&#x27;t particularly comfortable like socks would be - the way they&#x27;re put together, there&#x27;s big creases/joins on the bottom of the booties, from toe to heel.ing or moisturizing your feet for the whole week after you use your bootie, or else it probably won&#x27;t remove much skin.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life??? It took about 4 days for the peeling to start. Awesome, skin came right off, and my feet were soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I went to the local nail salon and got a pedicure, beautiful results.</li>
    <li> Regular size is not at all generous. This brand also has a really stingy amount of liquid. Baby Feet is more expensive per application but was much more effective for me.</li>
    <li> It has been a number of days since trying it and my feet have barely any peeling. I should have ordered the Baby Feet one! It&#x27;s not worth saving money if it doesn&#x27;t work!!!</li>
    <li> my friend gave me these and I liked them so much I ordered more.  After use- my feet didn&#x27;t start peeling for a few days.  After that it was 2-3 days of peeling.  Then I was callous free with smooth heels.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I am really impressed! Two of us used the mask and didn&#x27;t expect much....but then a week later, all the calluses and skin started coming off and now our feet are lovely and smooth. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh.  My daughter stand on feet all day. Terrible calluses on feet especially heels but really all over.  Deep cracking and just awful.  First time didn&#x27;t leave on along enough.  Second time did.  The calluses are just peeling OFF.  Would recommend this to everyone who has calluses from standing on  feet all day.</li>
    <li> Worked great, will definitely buy again.  I used Baby Foot before and this did the job the same, I am so happy as this costs considerably less.</li>
    <li> Took a couple of days but it worked on all but really tough callises</li>
    <li> Dont use them really they are very bad&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend you to buy it&lt;br /&gt;it has perfume and it increase  wrinkles On Feet .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working! I&#x27;m a peeling mess! I&#x27;m so excited my feet have never been so ugly and that&#x27;s actually a relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the foot mask on for 90 minutes and 3 days later this chemical peel is in full effect. Make sure not to hydrate your skin with any lotions when you use this. I did my research. Plug the bath drain when you take a shower and do no, DO NOT, put lotions on your ankles or feet. The dryness helps the shedding ensue.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I am a long time Amazon user and most of the time do not write reviews but I had to this time. Soaked my feet 6 days ago, it took about 4-5 days to start peeling but the results are SPECTACULAR. 7 days later and the skin is still peeling off....I can see the baby feet underneath. Would absolutely recommend this product...YOU WILL LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I would suggest you steer clear of this product! Not only did it not work, it dried out my feet terribly and my toenails are splitting because it made them so brittle. I have never in my life had that happen before! I followed the direction to a tee. I soaked my feet beforehand and then put these on for 1 hour and 25 minutes. The directions say to leave on for 60-90 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minute I opened this product, all I could smell was alcohol. That should have told me something! It has been 15 days now and my feet are worse than before I used this product. They are dry, dry, dry!! Never again! I give this product zero stars! Total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you still insist on trying this, I wear a womens size 10 shoe. These fit me fine, but I don&#x27;t think any bigger size foot would fit.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s body has a different chemical makeup. That being said I think explains why some folks this product did nothing and for others it was a miracle product. I think I am a lucky one as it worked great for me. My mom not a lucky one as her feet didn&#x27;t do anything. So it isn&#x27;t the product but the persons own body chemistry that is the problem.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Just make sure you soak before and each day after. I soaked in the hot tub before, then kept the booties on for about 2 hours. I then soaked each morning in the shower by plugging up the drain while I showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the expensive version first, and this one works just as well (and at half the price). I needed another go around after the expensive BabyFoot, and ordered this instead. What is really nice about this package is there are 3 sets, and if you have some serious callouses, reapplication is a must.</li>
    <li> These things are the best.  So much more product for less money than the other brands.  They work great as long as you follow the directions.  Make sure to soak your feet well before the application, and leave them on the prescribed amount of time.  My only complaint, I wish they had some way to secure the footies around the ankle once they are on.  I have ordered these again and again.</li>
    <li> Works every bit as well as the more expensive babyfoot brand.</li>
    <li> Great product!! It even cured my athletes foot!! Seriously!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Holika Holika brand of the peeling foot/baby foot mask. It worked for me, but the Purederm brand was cheaper ($13 for 3 pair), so of course I wanted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;booties&amp;#34; are actually plastic wrapper/bags lined with some kind of mesh with no way to strap it to the foot so it&#x27;s not that comfortable to walk around if you have to. I preferred Holika Holika booties as they are more like wearing soft material with a tie to secure it to your ankle. In any event, the actual gel is the same with both products, though Purderm&#x27;s is an even nicer scent; floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice for anyone who hasn&#x27;t done any foot peeling masks: it may take anywhere from 2-7 days to get any peeling. Everyone&#x27;s feet are different! And, some people might have a huge layer peel off in one piece, some might have tiny little bits flaking off &amp; making a big mess. Lastly, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PEEL ANYTHING THAT DOESN&#x27;T SEEM READY TO COME OFF. You will regret this. You&#x27;ll end up pulling off a thicker chunk that&#x27;s not meant to come off your foot any time soon and it&#x27;ll hurt and take a long time to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve noticed taking longer showers (or just soaking your feet), does help loosen everything up a bit. Rubbing lotion/moisturizer hasn&#x27;t helped me, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result is much softer feet. I do think it is pretty miraculous; the first time I tried it I couldn&#x27;t believe all the skin coming off. I thought it was total B.S. when I saw pictures of other people&#x27;s results, but the idea of the nasty skin on my feet getting peeled off to reveal more youthful &amp; less callused skin without having to get a pedicure was too good not to try. It definitely works 10x better than a pedicure. It may take longer, but it is much more effective. I have pretty callused &amp; cracked feet, and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the cracks, but it does help get me access to a deeper layer for me to get the moisturizer in, so I&#x27;m sure eventually I will be left with perfect feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to follow this with Holika Holika baby silky foot masks. It re-moisturizes and will for sure leave you with baby feet. I&#x27;ve compared it to my 6 month old and it feels almost identical. I love it! Remember, give it a week before you write a review! The first time, I waited 3 days and was so let down because nothing happened, but voila, on the fourth day BINGO! Now I&#x27;m doing it every month.ct feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to follow this with Holika Holika baby silky foot masks. It re-moisturizes and will for sure leave you with baby feet.

    <li> Works as advertised. It will take a few days before your feet start to peel.</li>
    <li> The Indiana weather this pass winter has done damage on my feet.  Being that spring is approaching decided to try this product. Received item pretty fast and decided till my off day to use.  Left on for 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Didn&#x27;t see anything happening until the next week and boy o boy my feet are peeling and sheets of dead skin is coming off.  This will definitely take a 2 week process. Buying another 3 pack.</li>
    <li> I spent a personal evening drinking wine and watching TV while wearing these foot masks.  Within a few days the dead skin will peel away.</li>
    <li> Meh.  I have pretty bad callouses and dry skin on my feet.  I tried another similar product which did a lot more.  This stuff took a full 2 weeks to kick in and it didn&#x27;t remove much.  I will use up the other 2 in the package, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Does what is says, but has a very strong rubbing alcohol smell.</li>
    <li> I bought these after I had tried the &amp;#34;baby foot&amp;#34; brand and was pleased with those results.  These were less costly and I guess there is a reason why.  I found I had to wear these 2x as long to get an almost similar effect as the baby foot.  In fact, I only really got those results after using the product 2x in three weeks... wearing it almost 2 hours the 2nd time.  I might buy these again, just wear them a lot longer as whatever makes this version &amp;#34;penetrate&amp;#34; is not so good as the baby foot I got before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the peeling part started about 5 days after wearing them.. and lasted for about 4 days afterwards.  I guess people will have different results, but that is what happened for me.</li>
    <li> Adequate but not a wow!</li>
    <li> I visited my mom and heard her went on and on about these foot masks she bought on a tour in South Korea. She was so thrilled with her results, I tought I had to try it. Naturally I found some on Amazon because this is where I found everything. The Purederm Foot Mask came in two pack, and a pair in each pack. Each mask has two layers. The inside paper layer is tissue like, with generous amount of serum. The outside plastic layer is water proof so the serum doesn&#x27;t leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I shared although my husband thought dry heels are normal for men. Here&#x27;s how all of us used these foot masks: clean feet, wipe dry, soak in the Foot Mask for 30 min, wash clean, pat dry, lotion up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the differences of the trials.&lt;br /&gt;-My mom bought her foot masks in South Korea. I bought PureDerm on Amazon. Different brand. Similar ingredient and claims.&lt;br /&gt;-My feet are the smoothest of all three of us. Minor peeling started on one of my feet on the 3rd day, my other feet did not start until the 6th day. My mom said her feet started peeling around 2 weeks. My husband has the thickest skin. His feet did not start peeling until after the 3rd week.&lt;br /&gt;-The peeling on my feet was very gradual, and went on for two week. My husband, the late bloomer, saw his feet finish peeling in only 4 days&lt;br /&gt;-the peeling on my feet (the thinnest skin) was most thorough. Even the cuticles on my toes peeled off as if I just had a pedicure&lt;br /&gt;-the improvement on my husband&#x27;s feet (the thickest skin) was most obvious. His heels were dry, cracked, yellow. After the peels, his feet were normal flesh color. They are not as soft as mine, but they are now very presentable and not at all scratchy like before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as you can see, the result differs for everyone. Just note that these mask are not very flexible. We had to cut out a little at the openings in order to stick our feet in. Then we wrap rubber bands around the masks at the ankle to prevent any leaking. We watched one episode of the  series &amp;#34;the Killing&amp;#34; sitting on the sofa while waiting for the 30 minutes to be up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are very happy with the result and will purchase more when our feet gets scratchy again.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the more exspensive brands. Get to shed all the dead skin. Better than a pedicure. I do it 3 times a year</li>
    <li> Girlfriend and I used as directed and were ecstatic with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly &amp;#34;idiot proof instructions&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;1) open&lt;br /&gt;2) clean feet thoroughly (***__before use__***)&lt;br /&gt;3) wear for 90 minutes (while you sit still and watch a movie)&lt;br /&gt;4) rinse (*** __not wash__; __not scrub__; __not scour__ ***)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a couple of days, your feet start to look gross as the tons of dead skin begins to flake away.  Of course, that&#x27;s what we want!.</li>
    <li> This was a gift I ordered for a family member.  It&#x27;s my understanding that it took using this product twice before her feet began to peel.  It did leave her feet baby soft</li>
    <li> used foot mask per instruction. in one week feet started to peel. 3 weeks later still have a small amt. of peeling. i still have the thick calluses but they did peel a little.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these worked as well as the Baby Feet brand but they did cause the dead skin to peel. Just not as much as the other brand.</li>
    <li> Works as well if not better than baby feet. Just reordered a year&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I understand this product may be geared more towards women. But, I&#x27;m a guy whose feet could stand some thick skin removal. I&#x27;ve used similar products with great results. But, the bags split when I put my size 11 feet in them.</li>
    <li> This really worked. My feet peeled like crazy. I haven&#x27;t given my fee the attention they needed in three months so they were kind of rough. But this product made them feel so smooth. It took about 4 days for the peeling to begin and by day 8 the major peelage ended. I would recommend this to anyone. I plan on doing this every two months. Awesome!</li>
    <li> Works so, so well. I was skeptical about whether or not it would work at all or as well as the article I had read about baby foot. This worked wonders on my feet that live in flip flops all year long. And it is a three pack! I highly recommend this foot mask!</li>
    <li> Works awesome and way cheaper then the Baby Feet brand!  I do the foot mask twice a year and this mask did not disappoint.  It had my feel peeling by day 4 and smooth and soft by day 8.  Only issue I had was that I wear a size 9 shoe and the bag ripped a bit because my feet just fit.</li>
    <li> Worked just like it said</li>
    <li> At first I thought &amp;#34;this stuff doesn&#x27;t work&amp;#34;, but a full week after I used it, wow I was shedding skin like a snake!&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you soak your feet and moisturize throughout the process. My feet are sooo soft now.&lt;br /&gt;I have hard callouses on my heels and it hasn&#x27;t completely removed those...yet.  I will use again before sandal time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this! I was using another comparable product with a higher price tag. However product works just as well with a lesser price tag, so I&#x27;ll stick with this one. Beautiful summer feet....CHECK!</li>
    <li> This worked wonderfully. My feet were baby soft after it was over. I waited about 5 days before anything happened. I noticed that the chair I watch TV from had a lot of debris around it and realized it was flaking skin! With a dry towel and cloth I kept the flaking under control and enjoyed the end results. Painless, safe, and fun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited for so long and my feet have NOT peeled whatsoever. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product. I followed the directions to a t, but all it did was make my feet hard and cracked. My feet look worse than they did BEFORE I used the product! Please save your money and DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Beware if you have large feet get the larger size, my 14&#x27;s are way too big for the regular size.</li>
    <li> This products delivers on its promise and for such a low cost. I have recommended it to everyone I know. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> If you are debating between these and the more expensive ones buy these you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> just what it says! its worth the price.</li>
    <li> I used Baby Foot the first time and it worked well enough. But it seemed like it could have removed more, especially from my heels. But I&#x27;ve decided that since these feet have been walking for quite awhile, maybe two doses were needed. So, because the price for this product was a lot cheaper I thought I&#x27;d try it. After using this product about a week ago I have been very pleased with the results. It&#x27;s nice to get it right! I do think both are effective but I gotta go with the cheaper product  because, well...duh!&lt;br /&gt;Actually I did have one problem. My feet were too big. I split one of them but it still did the job. Then I looked a little more here on Amazon, saw that I bought the regular size, not the large size! Really? Someday I may actually be smart! Anyway, I&#x27;ll give the two pair I have left to a friend and buy the large size for myself because despite fact that the process can gross me out a bit, the end result is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;And as for those who say it didn&#x27;t work for them maybe your feet are as hard as my head. I would suggest you try, try again.</li>
    <li> my feet don&#x27;t get very bad... Not like some people I know. At first glance they actually seem okay, but I hate wearing shoes so the skin on my feet gets tough so it can handle walking on the rocks and stuff outside. Anyway, I was using another product from Amazon that worked awesome and then I ordered again and they changed what they sent me and it didn&#x27;t work at all, so I tried this one and it&#x27;s AWESOME. I forgot to pre-soak my feet before I put the booties on, but j wore them for about and hour and fifteen minutes 6 days ago. On day 3 I soaked my feet and then today (day 6) I noticed some cracking and very light peeling so I soaked my feet again for 15 minutes. The picture is right after the soak tonight. Gross. Haha.</li>
