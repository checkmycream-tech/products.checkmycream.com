      <li>It washes off easily and has a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>It removes eye makeup easily and does a good job of moisturizing too.  </li>
      <li>It cleans well without drying and has a light, pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>I am also using that fancy scrubbing device that comes with the microdermabrasion kit because, hey, it&#x27;s 700 times more effective (that is, it is 701 times the effectiveness) of using the cleanser by itself.  </li>
      <li>I love this face wash because it doesn&#x27;t strip all the oil from my skin.</li>
      <li>I used to LOVE this face wash.</li>
      <li>I feel my pores look better too.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m guessing Olay was hoping it&#x27;s consumers would not be able to tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and works as advertised.</li>
      <li>Makes a huge difference...</li>
      <li>It is genlle and fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m too cheap to buy fancy, name-brand cosmetics - and this product works just as well for a fraction of the price.  </li>
      <li>I use this in the morning, and it makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
      <li>I really is a smooth, creamy cleanser that works well.</li>
      <li>A lot of nights, I just clean my face well and don&#x27;t even add moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Made us over oily and didn&#x27;t help clean out blackheads.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read good things about Olay&#x27;s product line and would definitely recommend them.</li>
      <li>Love most olay products, but this one was a definite miss.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does help with mild acne.  </li>
      <li>I had mild acne when I started and this helps with that.  </li>
      <li>, maybe appear more professional by having the correct skin quality.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin feels clean, soft, and lightly moisturized.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not softer or more supple, it doesn&#x27;t look different, the scars and whatnot have not disappeared or reduced in quality.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>But it does clean without drying, removes make-up including mascara, and leaves my skin soft and touchable.  </li>
      <li>It is the only thing that seems to be able to reasonably break up the Anti-Aging eye moisturizer, though, so</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s all the facial products I use and have been very satisfied for several years now.</li>
      <li>I used to buy at Target but have run into out of stock situatuions so it is much easier to order on line and</li>
      <li>I really like how it cleanses my oily skin without overdrying.</li>
      <li>It has also really helped in evening my skin tone.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is light and creamy and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.</li>
      <li>The cleanser is thinner, more soapy, and the ingredients on the back are completely different.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin naturally</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this a part of my everyday routine.</li>
      <li>Except when I use the microdermabrasion kit, my skin feels pretty much the same as it did before.  </li>
      <li>Its cleans my face completely even my eye makeup!</li>
      <li>I was so surprised.  </li>
      <li>I am young, but my mom uses it on her skin and loves it too.</li>
      <li>The new formula is NOT THE SAME.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and last a long time.  </li>
      <li>Old face wash is on the left.</li>
      <li>I have to be careful with any facial products as I have sensitivity issues particularly with fragrances.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Since I have grown older, I have spent a small fortune on big name cleansers that promise big things, without finding one to please me. Either the price is outrageous or the product fails to live up to its claims or, most frequently, both.  This is where my search ends.  I decided to get a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; product and save my money.  I was so surprised.  It cleans well without drying and has a light, pleasant scent.  It seems to be a lot of product for the money.  No, my skin did not look 20 years younger overnight.  But it does clean without drying, removes make-up including mascara, and leaves my skin soft and touchable.  I feel my pores look better too. I love that it is also much less expensive than the hyped-up versions that don&#x27;t perform nearly as well.</li>
    <li> Makes a huge difference... Amazing product.</li>
    <li> I used to LOVE this face wash. The formula was thick and creamy and left my face ready for whatever I had lined up for it next...whether it was makeup application for the day or night time cream before bed. The new formula is NOT THE SAME. The cleanser is thinner, more soapy, and the ingredients on the back are completely different. The label on the front was not changed at all so I&#x27;m guessing Olay was hoping it&#x27;s consumers would not be able to tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to write negative reviews but I don&#x27;t know why they would change the ingredients of a cleanser that worked so well! At the price Olay is selling this for, I might as well buy department store cleanser where I know the quality won&#x27;t be sacrificed in order to save the company money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add photos to show the difference in the ingredients. Old face wash is on the left.</li>
    <li> I have to be careful with any facial products as I have sensitivity issues particularly with fragrances. This is perfect! Its cleans my face completely even my eye makeup!</li>
    <li> I am using this as part of my Olay recommended regiment.  I am also using that fancy scrubbing device that comes with the microdermabrasion kit because, hey, it&#x27;s 700 times more effective (that is, it is 701 times the effectiveness) of using the cleanser by itself.  I am 27 and in law school so I thought I would see what all this facial care stuff is about, maybe appear more professional by having the correct skin quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  It is the only thing that seems to be able to reasonably break up the Anti-Aging eye moisturizer, though, so for that I give it props.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does help with mild acne.  I had mild acne when I started and this helps with that.  (Probably because you&#x27;re religiously cleaning your face twice a day.)  However, it does not cure moderate acne, which I got after using the daily daytime moisturizer.  I have this pimple that I swear is growing its own blood vessel now that just will not die after using that moisturizer.  This helps with everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, though, that I haven&#x27;t otherwise noticed a difference in my skin quality.  Except when I use the microdermabrasion kit, my skin feels pretty much the same as it did before.  It&#x27;s not softer or more supple, it doesn&#x27;t look different, the scars and whatnot have not disappeared or reduced in quality.  I&#x27;m going to give this another month since I&#x27;m going to give the microdemabrasion another month but I&#x27;m not entirely hopeful.</li>
    <li> Made us over oily and didn&#x27;t help clean out blackheads. Blackheads got worse.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product, as I don&#x27;t usually gravitate toward &#x27;cream&#x27; cleansers, but my skin had been a bit dry lately.  This one didn&#x27;t impress me.  It left my skin feeling a bit greasy and did not wash off well at all, nor did it remove my makeup as expected.  Love most olay products, but this one was a definite miss.</li>
    <li> I like this facial cleaner. Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m too cheap to buy fancy, name-brand cosmetics - and this product works just as well for a fraction of the price.  My skin feels clean, soft, and lightly moisturized.  I use it w/ other Olay products.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Not enough moisture for dry, mature skin.</li>
    <li> Good product.  It removes eye makeup easily and does a good job of moisturizing too.  A lot of nights, I just clean my face well and don&#x27;t even add moisturizer. I really is a smooth, creamy cleanser that works well.</li>
    <li> Just started using Olay products after switching from Neutrogena. I really like how it cleanses my oily skin without overdrying. I use this in the morning, and it makes my skin feel so smooth. I am young, but my mom uses it on her skin and loves it too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and makes your face feel so clean without drying your skin out. It is easy to use and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash because it doesn&#x27;t strip all the oil from my skin. I have very oily skin naturally and I strip all the oils it only gets worse so this is an excellent wash for that. It has also really helped in evening my skin tone. I always receive compliments on my skin and am asked on what I use. I always say I use Olay Total Effects exclusively for my skin care. I don&#x27;t known these products are only marketed towards women (I&#x27;m a dude), but it is one the few things that works with my oily skin without making it worse.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is light and creamy and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all. It washes off easily and has a pleasant scent. I use it with Olay&#x27;s rotary facial cleansing brush...not every time I wash my face, maybe 2 x week. I also use Olay Micro Sculpting cream moisturizer. That&#x27;s all the facial products I use and have been very satisfied for several years now. I&#x27;ve read good things about Olay&#x27;s product line and would definitely recommend them. I used to buy the expensive department store products, but felt I was literally sending my $$ down the drain. Just thinking of all the money I&#x27;ve saved over the years makes me want to buy that Cuisinart toaster oven I&#x27;ve been wanting.</li>
    <li> It feels great knowing that your doing something good for your face.  I&#x27;ve been using this on a daily basis for a few weeks now and I have to say its great.  You can cleanse your face without drying it out.  I&#x27;m glad I made this a part of my everyday routine.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever switch from this cleanser.  It is genlle and fragrance free.  Works well with the Olay toner.</li>
    <li> This seems to be the best cleanser for me!  It even removes my mascara, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced and last a long time.  I used to buy at Target but have run into out of stock situatuions so it is much easier to order on line and to my surprise it is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Works good for me!</li>
