    <li> Great for the hair and keeps it shiny!  It helps add volume to my fine wavy hair as well as protects the color.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I was recommended to this product by my hair stylist. Great product to help straighten my hair (my hair is wavy at baseline). It is non-greasy and really smooths my hair with minimal fly aways. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products over the years and this one is my favorite. It is a little pricey but my last bottle lasted me about 6-8 months. It is in new packaging with a few more ounces in the bottle. Easy transaction and fast shipping, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Using Kerastase products the past 2 years has changed my life. My hair feels like it did prior to ever highlighting it, and I attribute that to my use of Kerastase and Pureology hair care. This product I apply after every washing. It makes my hair look smooth and silky after I blow it out. Cannot be without this tube of magic.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product... Leaves your hair soft, full bodied and frizz-free. Worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite a while now at least 7 years .. I try other products for a while but I notice myself missing it and buying it again ..&lt;br /&gt; No doubt about it it is expensive but it works for my hair type . I was first introduced to it by my stylist at a well known salon . She said it would work well for my hair and I  am happy she encouraged me to try it as it is pricey .. Not only pricey but at times difficult to find as only certain salons carry it . I have  long highlighted hair and depending on who does the highlights my hair sometimes suffers from extreme dryness on the ends ..  This keeps my hair manageable .&lt;br /&gt;I love the fresh smell but it might not be for everyone . It disappiates quickly though .&lt;br /&gt;  As I said I have tried other products recommended by people on Amazon but this one is still  a favorite !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi&lt;br /&gt; Back again I notice this product is listed at a much lower price right now . It is usually in the $34.00 range and not always available on prime If u are thinking of giving it a try now is the time ..&lt;br /&gt; It is much more expensive at the salon where I go not to mention we have a high sales tax where I live .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like some products do. It also smells nice! I have thick hair and most product weight my hair down, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love this product...my hairstylist uses this on my hair every time I visit the salon.  It smells great, light weight (doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair) and is fabulous for heat protection on your hair from blow drying or flat irons.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok! smells like medicine.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Apply to slightly damp hair, then bring on the heat! This prouduct  is activated by the heat of your blow dryer, flat iron, etc. (It won&#x27;t work if you apply &amp; leave to air dry). My hair is shiny to the ends, and feels 50% fuller! I let my 3 school age girls use it, too. Cheap shampoos &amp; styling products&#x3D;damaged hair, no matter your age. There really IS a difference with the best salon products (thankfully available on Amazon for a better price!)</li>
    <li> Again, my wife loves this product which she first received from a Turkish friend several years ago. Now it&#x27;s a staple in her hair care cabinet.</li>
    <li> Well known luxury brand at a decent price.  Salons mark up these products outrageously.  It&#x27;s still overpriced, but a bargain compared to what you will pay at a beauty shop.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair and so I bought my own bottle. The difference could be felt and seen. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the reviews on this product but I can tell you from the very first dime drop I put in my hair it was a miserable.  I can&#x27;t believe the time it cut down on stying my hair.  Actually all I had to do was blow dry it and it looks so much better than when I spend time working on it!  I will continue to use this product from now on!  Thanks and super fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> My hair looks amazing! I will not live without this product.</li>
    <li> Would not purchase this again.  Has a very strange scent</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  Keeps ends of hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Love these Kershaw products. Does well with fine limp hair pre blow drying.</li>
    <li> When I use this my hair feels horrible. Extra dry and coarse (if that is even possible). The smell is not that good either; it smells like... bamboo. I guess if you like the smell it would be okay, but I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any improvement. There are a lot of better things out there.</li>
    <li> This product saved my hair. I&#x27;ve always had beautiful hair until 2 yeas ago when a hair dresser fried it during highlights. I was devastated and had to actually turn down some television interviews.  Another hairdresser turned me on to this product and I do think it saved my hair. Today, my hair is back to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;norm&amp;#34; and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.... It&#x27;s worth every penny... I just wish they came in bigger sizes.</li>
