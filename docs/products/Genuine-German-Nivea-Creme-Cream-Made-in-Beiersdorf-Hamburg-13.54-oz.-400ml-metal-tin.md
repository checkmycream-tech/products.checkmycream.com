      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>and I plan on purchasing more.</li>

      <li>It is so much better than the Thailand one I bought from amazon prime.  </li>
      <li>love the cream and mine</li>
      <li>but La Mer seems to do better at healing an injury to the skin.  </li>
      <li>I love my nivea.  </li>
      <li>so I am pleased with what I bought.</li>
      <li>I just thought this would work better than the Avon stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I bought it specifically for use on my face as I had heard others say this is comparable to a much more pricier face product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure will be even bettero</li>
      <li>It smells more like plastic roses if I could describe the difference.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This is so much better than what they sell in stores here.  </li>
      <li>Love this vender.</li>
      <li>excellent consistency, fast delivery/shipment very reasonable price</li>
      <li>Genuine German Nivea Cream is one of the best, all purpose creams out there.</li>
      <li>:)  A bit more creamy and smooth on application than the Nivea Creme that is made in Mexico, in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I got the genuine cream.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a pleasant smell that reminds me of citrus mixed with a vintage-smell type of flower, like rose or lavender.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So glad I found this original, German-made product on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Hands down, Nivea is the best skin product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I am a former Creme de la mer user and have heard great things about Nivea from Germany(mine was from Germany).</li>
      <li>Nivea Smooth Souffle soaks into the skin faster, you don&#x27;t want to have this film on your face for hours get the Souffle.  </li>
      <li>recommend it to anyone who wants a great cream and a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I was so excited.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying a few more, it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
      <li>Would be great for those with no oil and dry skin though,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my tried and true Avon Moisture Therapy Intensive Hand Cream.  </li>
      <li>I have received the box faster than predicted and in good condition,and the cream itself it is similar with the one made in Mexico.</li>
      <li>I would say ItalianBarber is a larger more reputable company.</li>
      <li>The recipient of this cream wants more: she liked it and says that it is the only cream she uses.</li>
      <li>Love this classic iconic creme, especially in the winter months since it is quite rich.</li>
      <li>It really does work and the fact that this is genuine made in Germany</li>
      <li>It might be too heavy for people with oily skin, but I have combination skin and it has worked great.</li>
      <li>Also, it has no scent, which is rare for Avon.  </li>
      <li>The point of putting lotion or cream on right after a shower or washing your hands is to lock in moisture.  </li>
      <li>I really recommend it, specially for winter time.</li>
      <li>It takes between 2 weeks to a month to get the authentic German version, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Brings back old memories because my moms friend used to always use this and the scent reminds me of her (in a good way).</li>
      <li>Thankfully I was able to locate a German meat shop that for some reason sells authentic German Nivea.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easier to get moisturizes better is only made in Germany.  </li>
      <li>and it is most definitely from Germany.</li>
      <li>It smells similar to the German version, but not as good.</li>
      <li>The scent reminds me of baby lotion, soft and mild.</li>
      <li>quickly absorbs into my skin and leaves it soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The tin is rather large and you get a lot of product for the money.</li>
      <li>really had all the ingredients from Germany</li>
      <li>this is my second time ordering this product --it is fabulous for women over 50.  </li>
      <li>The stuff we get here in the US is very watery in comparison.  </li>
      <li>Seems genuine enough to me.</li>
      <li>Thanks...</li>
      <li>I needed the Nivea when I ordered it and couldn&#x27;t wait for the whole return/replace process for an undamaged tin.</li>
      <li>Apologized and said that Amazon does the packing and therefore is responsible to correct the problem.  </li>
      <li>If you apply it to wet or damp skin, it will spread better and melt into your skin.</li>
      <li>But for those who don&#x27;t care about scent, it isn&#x27;t very distinguishable.</li>
      <li>and it IS the REAL thing.</li>
      <li>It leaves a luster on my skin even after being absorbed (the German cream is luster when applied, but matte once absorbed).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the original German version for about 10 years now, but didn&#x27;t want to pay shipping costs.</li>
      <li>Also, it does not go on easily unless your skin is completely dry.  </li>
      <li>This Nivea cream from Germany is the most high quality compared to other manufacturered locations.</li>
      <li>Two preservatives that not only are difficult to pronounce :) but they just aren&#x27;t good to leave sitting on your skin.</li>

    <li> I am a former Creme de la mer user and have heard great things about Nivea from Germany(mine was from Germany). It&#x27;s comparable to Creme and I love the thickness and scent. It might be too heavy for people with oily skin, but I have combination skin and it has worked great. I feel like my skin is glowing after I apply it and I plan on purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Came all banged up, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The recipient of this cream wants more: she liked it and says that it is the only cream she uses.</li>
    <li> So rich but very good moisturizer. Good for hands and as night cream. I really recommend it, specially for winter time.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and was surprised at the quantity vs the price.  She says it keeps her hands soft all week with just one application.  We bought this as an alternative to La Mer -  it works well for maintenance but La Mer seems to do better at healing an injury to the skin.  So she will use this bargain daily and save the ridiculously expensive stuff only for the occasional injury.</li>
    <li> This cream is deluxe.  So thick and rich.  The stuff we get here in the US is very watery in comparison.  Thank you for sending this all the way from Germany!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the original German version for about 10 years now, but didn&#x27;t want to pay shipping costs. The Amazon seller &amp;#34;Total Recall&amp;#34; is a great seller. It takes between 2 weeks to a month to get the authentic German version, but it&#x27;s worth it. I like to use this as an eye cream at night, and a eye and regular face moisturizer during the day. A little bit goes a long way, so one of the big tubs will last a long time! I have oily skin and have not had any breakouts, in fact this has made my skin better.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than what they sell in stores here.  Creamy and thick.  Helps so much with dry skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry if I don&#x27;t moisturize with a heavy cream daily. I discovered nivea creme last year and I&#x27;m totally hooked. It&#x27;s thick so it takes a little more time to rub in than lotion but it leaves my skin soft and supple. It doesn&#x27;t break me out except on my face. IMO, it&#x27;s too heavy to use as a facial moisturizer. A little goes a long way so this size tin easily lasts a month and a half to two months.</li>
    <li> This has become my HG, it&#x27;s extremely thick but I use it on my face everyday at night and I haven&#x27;t gotten any pimples. My skin has never been this good and it has been keeping my rosacea flares controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the cream and mine really had all the ingredients from Germany so I am pleased with what I bought. What I did not liked much was that the tin came dented but it was fully sealed so I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so thick and creamy!  I was so excited.  But after I tried it for several days, I noticed I was re-applying very often (especially on my hands).  Also, it does not go on easily unless your skin is completely dry.  The point of putting lotion or cream on right after a shower or washing your hands is to lock in moisture.  I&#x27;ll stick with my tried and true Avon Moisture Therapy Intensive Hand Cream.  Until I found this Avon stuff ~15 years ago, I gave up on finding something that worked and I would get ingredients from an apothecary and make my own cream in a blender.  I use the Avon stuff all over my body.  I sent some to a Dental Hygienist whose hands were badly cracked and would not heal (she tried everything out there... Borage, Working Hands, you name it).  She said the Avon worked the best of all of them.  It&#x27;s not cheap, so I wait until it goes on sale  (like $1.50-$2.00 a tube) then buy about 20 tubes of it.  I got my boyfriend hooked on it about 10 years ago.  Also, it has no scent, which is rare for Avon.  I don&#x27;t buy anything from Avon except that hand cream.  Anyway, I will use up the Nivea, mixing it in with the Avon until it&#x27;s gone.  I just thought this would work better than the Avon stuff.  When will I learn?</li>
    <li> So far so good...only been using it for 2weeks and I already see a difference...long term use I&#x27;m sure will be even bettero</li>
    <li> Thick,soothing protection for my sensitive skin. So glad I found this original, German-made product on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  I have extemely dry skin, especially in winter.  I use this every night before bed and avoid the dry,cracked skin that usually plagues me.  I put it on a patch of eczema and it went away!</li>
    <li> My mom used this on all her kids and I am now using this on all my kids. The best all around cream IMO. It doesn&#x27;t break me out just dewy skin. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Had always thought about using this but never got around to purchasing it. Brings back old memories because my moms friend used to always use this and the scent reminds me of her (in a good way). I bought it specifically for use on my face as I had heard others say this is comparable to a much more pricier face product. This does a great job moisturizing my face. It tends to be thick but not an issue for me since I use it mainly at night.</li>
    <li> Best beauty cream there is. Make sure you buy the one made in Germany</li>
    <li> this is my second time ordering this product --it is fabulous for women over 50.  Will be ordering it again</li>
    <li> I use this during the winter because of its thick formula. It hydrates and protects my skin. It also leaves my skin feeling soft and supple. The largest size lasts for a long time. I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
    <li> Love this vender. This is from Germany and has that great Nivea smell we all love</li>
    <li> Very good , my friend love it because it&#x27;s made in Germany!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. The tin says it is made in Germany. I was hesitant to order it as some reviews said it wasn&#x27;t, but it was.</li>
    <li> I see that the last reviewer had the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;I did write to the supplier and requested a partial refund.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t heard anything yet.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I am disappointed and if I do not hear from the supplier I will look for this German made Nivea elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Supplier did answer my email regarding the dent.  Apologized and said that Amazon does the packing and therefore is responsible to correct the problem.  Amazon does allow you to return the item and will replace it, but I needed the Nivea when I ordered it and didn&#x27;t have the luxury of a)time to pack the dented tin and drive to the post office to mail it and b) I needed the Nivea when I ordered it and couldn&#x27;t wait for the whole return/replace process for an undamaged tin. Next time I am going to order directly from the supplier Smallflower.com and purchase enough to get free shipping.</li>
    <li> There is a difference in ingredients with Nivea products depending on where they are manufactured. This Nivea cream from Germany is the most high quality compared to other manufacturered locations. I use it as night cream before I go to bed. It feels very thick and heavy on my skin, but when I wake up, my face is fully moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love my nivea.  would not leave home without it. started using it in 1976 when I moved to Germany. been using it ever since. great for your face.&lt;br /&gt;this is a wonderful deal. recommend it to anyone who wants a great cream and a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I used Nivea cream my hole life. I am glad I got the genuine cream.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t  feel like this product from Germany&lt;br /&gt; i would never buy it again</li>
    <li> Fals advertisment! The cream is made in Spain. I should&#x27;ve given only one star but I did not want to create a negative impresion about the product. I&#x27;ve been using it since I can remember (around 40 years now - I was born and I grew up in Europe).I also know that some of the European countries have production licenses, including Spain. I have received the box faster than predicted and in good condition,and the cream itself it is similar with the one made in Mexico.</li>
    <li> container arrived in damaged condition and I&#x27;m not positive, but I have a Nivea Creme that a friend from Hamburg, Germany gave me and German was the first language listed on the back along with other languages but the one I received supposedly made in Hamburg listed the first language as Italian, so I&#x27;m wondering if I received the &#x27;real&#x27; thing?</li>
    <li> Made my skin breakout terribly.</li>
    <li> Smaller tin than earlier but that is inflation - but my the entire female side of my family and in laws love and trust only Nivea</li>
    <li> excellent consistency, fast delivery/shipment very reasonable price</li>
    <li> Want a made in Germany product?  Nivea Smooth Souffle soaks into the skin faster, you don&#x27;t want to have this film on your face for hours get the Souffle.  It&#x27;s easier to get moisturizes better is only made in Germany.  I own both the creme is really good, I bought mine from SmallFlower and it appears to be authentic, they have their own website now called smallflowerdotcom.  It is so much better than the Thailand one I bought from amazon prime.  I buy it from ItalianBarberdotcom if Small Flower doesn&#x27;t have it in stock.  I would say ItalianBarber is a larger more reputable company.</li>
    <li> Ordered and just received mine from Smallflower through Amazon and it is most definitely from Germany. Well, that&#x27;s my assumption as ingredients are displayed in german and it does not say Made in Thailand anywhere. Seems genuine enough to me. :)  A bit more creamy and smooth on application than the Nivea Creme that is made in Mexico, in my opinion.  I actually like the brand that is made in Mexico, but I will spend a bit of extra money for this one simply because I don&#x27;t want to apply anything to my face that has &#x27;Methylchloroisothiazolinone&#x27; and &#x27;Methylisothiazolinone&#x27; in it; Two preservatives that not only are difficult to pronounce :) but they just aren&#x27;t good to leave sitting on your skin. These 2 ingredients are in (the astronomically expensive) Creme de la Mer as well, which really surprises me. Really wish Nivea would come up with a more natural and less irritating preservative, if a preservative Nivea Creme must have.  In conclusion, I believe it&#x27;s a very good product, from wherever you happen to buy it.</li>
    <li> I have had horribly dry skin all my life &amp; this is amazing. There is a huge difference between the kind you buy at the pharmacy &amp; this kind made in Germany. I will buy this repeatedly. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Only complain is that it take time to get it since it is shipped from Germany.</li>
    <li> Thankfully I was able to locate a German meat shop that for some reason sells authentic German Nivea. I also purchased American Nivea from Target to compare the two. And the difference between the two is this: INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;German Nivea ends in an ingredient called CINNAMYL ALCOHOL.&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, German Nivea is firmer in texture and has more thickness, but only slightly.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant smell that reminds me of citrus mixed with a vintage-smell type of flower, like rose or lavender.&lt;br /&gt;It quickly absorbs into my skin and leaves it soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American Nivea ends in an ingredient called METHYLCHOLOROISOTHIALOZENE and METHYLISOTHIALINONE.&lt;br /&gt;It is somewhat shinier and thinner, and turns &amp;#34;soupy&amp;#34; in the middle. It leaves a luster on my skin even after being absorbed (the German cream is luster when applied, but matte once absorbed). It smells similar to the German version, but not as good. It smells more like plastic roses if I could describe the difference. I have a sensitive sense of smell so I definitely prefer the smell of the German cream over the American version. But for those who don&#x27;t care about scent, it isn&#x27;t very distinguishable. In any case, I will not be using the American version any longer as I do not like the sound of those two ingredients listed above. They are preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve posted photos of my two cream tins. As you can see, the German version does not explicitly state that is was made it Germany, but the ingredients tell all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;German ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Aqua, paraffinum liquidum, cera microcristallina, glycerin, lanolin alcohol (Eucerit), paraffin, panthenol, decyl oleate, octyldodecanol, aluminum stearates, citric acid, magnesium sulfate, magnesium stearate, parfum, limonene, geraniol, hydroxycitronellol, linalool, citronellol, benzyl benzoate, cinnamyl alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Apparently Canadian Nivea has the same formula, except that it ends its list with just &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; (the last 7 ingredients in the German cream are considered fragrances under Canadian standards)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American ingredients (Made in Mexico):&lt;br /&gt;Water, Mineral Oil, Petrolatum, Glycerin, Microcrystalline Wax, Lanolin Alcohol, Paraffin, Panthenol, Magnesium Sulfate, Decyl Oleate, Octyldodecanol, Aluminum Stearates, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Magnesium Stearate, Methylchloroisothiazoline, Methylisothiazolinone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Thai version also contains the last two preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: I did not try the Canadian or Thai version of Nivea, so I cannot vouch for the quality of those. However, as Canadian formula &#x3D; German and Thai &#x3D; American, one might deduce that quality &#x3D; quality.</li>
    <li> Thanks...Great product!</li>
    <li> This cream is great for the face as it smooths and hydrates your skin while also improving your complexion. It really does work and the fact that this is genuine made in Germany says a lot about the good quality of this product. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to try something new!</li>
    <li> This was clearly made in Thailand.  The tin says so.  The sticker is placed there to cover the &amp;#34;Made in Thailand on the tin.  This is a scam.  Also the ingredients listed are not the ingredients listed on the tin I received.  I prefer to buy the Made in Mexico Nivea Cream, at least it delivers a quality product and does not it cost twice as much as this one does.  This company should be shut down for misrepresentation.  Look at the ingredients listed and the &amp;#34;Made in Thailand&amp;#34; on the tin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Really thick, so warm between your fingers before applying.</li>
    <li> Genuine German Nivea Cream is one of the best, all purpose creams out there. The scent reminds me of baby lotion, soft and mild. It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer, made in Beiersdorf Hamburg, no mention of Thailand at all on my tin. If the seller/Amazon activates the \\&quot;add a picture\\&quot; option again, I will post it.  The tin is rather large and you get a lot of product for the money. If you apply it to wet or damp skin, it will spread better and melt into your skin. I&#x27;m buying a few more, it&#x27;s great stuff. Recommended</li>
    <li> Love this classic iconic creme, especially in the winter months since it is quite rich. Comparable to La Mer, but definitely has to be the German import. Only order from&lt;br /&gt;Small flower.... Their the best and to be trusted for authentic product.</li>
    <li> Everyday item.  Nivea from Germany is a must! Kind bought at stores in the us is not made in Germany, but Mexico!</li>
    <li> this nivea is the BEST in the world....i use it on my face hands and body...and don&#x27;t use anything else and i used to be a skin care specialist...esthetician and i love this stuff!!!...and i&#x27;m 50 years old and people say i look like i&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s or 40&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Total liars...the writing on the tin is all in Tai!  Fraud!  Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Great body cream, bought it for face to be compared to crime de la mer but probably won&#x27;t use it for that. I&#x27;m 37 and have always struggled with oily skin and have always needed to use an acne treatment and this stuff is too thick to put on my fave. Would be great for those with no oil and dry skin though,</li>
    <li> Hands down, Nivea is the best skin product I&#x27;ve ever used.  45 years now and at 61, people still think I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  I briefly tried other products, but nothing beats Nivea.</li>
    <li> Fair price, very good product, was shipped super fast.</li>
    <li> The order arrived so much SOONER than expected and it IS the REAL thing. Great value for the price. My face is VERY HAPPY</li>
