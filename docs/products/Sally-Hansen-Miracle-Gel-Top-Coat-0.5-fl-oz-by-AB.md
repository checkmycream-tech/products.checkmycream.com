      <li>I liked it!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been using Sally Hansen Triple Strong with wonderful results, but needed to take it off and re-apply every 3 - 4 days.</li>
      <li>I purchased Truffle Shuffle, a neutral medium brown shade (perfect for the workplace) and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>

      <li>The shine is seriously gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Good luck changing colors).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>The good (miraculous indeed)</li>
      <li>To be fair, I am comparing this to the Gel that you receive at the nail salons.  </li>
      <li>Awesome right?!</li>
      <li>However, this top coat forms a great barrier and gives my nails strength.</li>
      <li>I have to say that this is a great grill top coat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this top coat.</li>
      <li>This is easily the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars for looking very good for the short time it does look good - and the shine is quite brilliant during that time.</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this to try!</li>
      <li>This top coat is literally just the icing on the cake!</li>
      <li>I love this Polish!</li>
      <li>but it sure did hold up well over a week!  </li>
      <li>I love the colours of the polish!  </li>
      <li>Never will buy the top coat again!  </li>
      <li>They have so many colors to choose from!</li>
      <li>Love these products &amp; so happy not to have to go to a salon &amp; pay for good looking nails anymore:))</li>
      <li>I was so excited to overhaul my nail polish with what was supposed to wear beautifully for two weeks.  </li>
      <li>It looks amazing on my fingers &amp; toes.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>but I give the shine a 4-6 day period, which for me is amazing, I just reapply after that and</li>
      <li>I really liked it until I realized it was ruining my nails.</li>
      <li>Dries the color nicely.  </li>
      <li>so if you like doing your own nails, this may work for you.</li>
      <li>This products help my nails that tend to split after reaching a nice length.  </li>
      <li>Polish stays on sooooo nicely   </li>
      <li>but I cant seem to spend that kind of money on something that looks</li>
      <li>y u get 2 for $14.00( the top coat and any color), by the way the product is good, so shiny</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used it with the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel polishes, just my own polish, so</li>
      <li>There were times I added another layer of top coat, there were times I didn&#x27;t, and my nails looked good either way.  </li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m kind of disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>best when I did one nail at a time appling topcoat to the leading edge of the nail, and then over the whole nail.  </li>
      <li>Probably the best plus for me is that it dries insanely fast.</li>
      <li>While I like how it looks, I will not be spending this kind of money (I paid $10 at Walgreens) on it again.</li>
      <li>I do like how it looks - nice shine to it.</li>
      <li>I am a person who does my own nail design.</li>
      <li>I really liked the polish</li>
      <li>drys nicely.</li>
      <li>Part of appearing well groomed (to me) is to have nice nails.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m super happy.  </li>
      <li>It comes off very easily with acetone</li>
      <li>No chips until about 8 days after application which I feel is great and worth the price.</li>
      <li>Before this product, my best efforts never  looked anything close to a professional manicure.</li>
      <li>the colors are nice and the top coat is shiny.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed about this nail polish was that it feels great going on, drying, and staying</li>
      <li>Nice strong black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
      <li>easy to do own polish at home</li>
      <li>So I bought the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel @ Rite Aid for $15.99 for the set which came with the top coat &amp; a beige color.</li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure to share all my tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I foolishly purchased 5 colors (my mistake)and the top Gel Coat.</li>
      <li>I bought this top coat and a purple to try, I wanted to see how well it worked</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s because my nail polish never stays on more than 3 or 4 days</li>
      <li>I do it Sunday nights, 2 color coats, one top coat).  </li>
      <li>I am sure it is the intention of Sally Hansen to sell the color and top coat together</li>
      <li>Plus the top coat seems to strip the color off the non gel nail polish.</li>
      <li>It does take a bit longer to remove, but I love that I don&#x27;t have to soak as I did with Gelish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With the miracle gel colors and top coat</li>
      <li>I can wear the top coat for a week and there will be no chips.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this top coat.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is really great srudd. It performs exactly as  advertised. Makes my nail polosh look so professionally done when I put a coat of this over it.</li>
    <li> I did the French manicure in this and it is amazing! ! It lasted about 6 days and that&#x27;s with me cleaning and doing normal day to day things.  Did not even try to be careful.  I will be getting more colors for sure at this rate.  Normally I get 3 days from a polish. So double that and I&#x27;m super happy.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long, waste of money</li>
    <li> This top coat is a must when using Sally Hansen Miracle Gel. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My nails were stained and damaged after removing this. It&#x27;s been months and it&#x27;s still growing out. I really liked the polish but I&#x27;m  terrified to use it again</li>
    <li> I am a person who does my own nail design. I have to say that this is a great grill top coat. I can wear the top coat for a week and there will be no chips. A good top coat will allow your nail design to lay long. Also this is better than three uv light ones since the uv light can cause skin cancer. Make sure you still use a base coat, it says you don&#x27;t need to but you really should use one. Can also use this with regular polish underneath.</li>
    <li> I used this with the Dig Fig Miracle Gel polish. While I do like that it dries faster than other top coats, it started chipping after only three days! I will use the rest of the bottle but will not be purchasing it again. I was looking forward to it lasting at least a week, but it is not any better than regular top coat. When I removed the polish it left a pink stain on my nails as well.</li>
    <li> I clean houses for a living and I love having my nails done but obviously its pointless. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try gel nails but I cant seem to spend that kind of money on something that looks like I could of done, so I tried this. I bought this top coat and a purple to try, I wanted to see how well it worked so I tried different colors/ brands with this top coat and they ARE chipping but the gel purple is not. Plus the top coat seems to strip the color off the non gel nail polish. the top coat dried fast but make sure and seal the ends well. Over all the product is good once you get passed the sticker price which I find ridiculously expensive for nail polish. But if it lasts and no more trips to the salon, its worth it</li>
    <li> Brought this at target, but it&#x27;s the same product.  Simply terrible. Takes forever to dry, meaning hours not minutes!  Chipped within 24 hours.  Better off paying less for a regular Polish.  This will be the first beauty product I ever returned for not liking it!</li>
    <li> Nice color, horrible product. The nails not only chip after two days, but they also start to reflect a dirty color. Save your money and use Elmer&#x27;s Glue for a unique touch, I bet that will peel off less easier.</li>
    <li> After spending approximately $15 for the polish and the gel, it chipped after only two days! I even wear rubber gloves to do dishes and clean. Giving it the benefit of the doubt, I tried using it again only this time I used two coats of polish then applied the gel.  Unfortunately, I had the same results. On the upside, it dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product initially. While it only lasted one week, as opposed to the two weeks promised in the product description, that still seemed like a long time to me. I&#x27;d been using Sally Hansen Triple Strong with wonderful results, but needed to take it off and re-apply every 3 - 4 days. Using the Triple Strong this way I had long, beautiful, strong nails, which was great because in my work as a Barbra Streisand impersonator/tribute artist long nails are a required part of the costume. After using SH Miracle Gel for a few weeks, I noticed my nails breaking and splitting. The product ruined the entire surface of my nails! Now I have to use fake nails for shows until the damaged nail surface grows out- what a pain! I wish I&#x27;d looked on Amazon for reviews before purchasing this product at Ulta because I would have seen other people make this complaint and saved myself a lot of trouble.</li>
    <li> To be fair, I am comparing this to the Gel that you receive at the nail salons.  I do not feel this helps my nail polish stay chip free any longer than regular polish does.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product! Stays on for 2 weeks as stated and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
    <li> First I only write reviews about things that totally blow me away, either with their amazing quality or their lack of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nail polish lasts about 7 days for me and not because it chips, but because I have extremely fast growing nails and 7 days of growth is about all I can stand! I am not a princess-y girl and my days involve feeding animals, hauling water, high intensity work outs, lots of baking and cooking, and cleaning... Meaning I need a nail polish that is just as tough as my everyday life. This is definitely the one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With most nail polishes and any salon style manicure, the feeling of it on my nails drives me crazy... Heavy and suffocating, especially while drying. The first thing I noticed about this nail polish was that it feels great going on, drying, and staying on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that a lot of people complain about the tips wearing, but I really make sure the polish and most importantly the top coat is going on thick every where, especially the tips. Depending on how you paint your nails sometimes the tips can get less of the product and that obviously causes wear problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this as good as salon quality? No, but it has some pros and cons compared... including the price. So it lasts a week... well you can buy a BOTTLE for 7.99$ at Walmart, Target, or other drug store... I would say worth the price!!</li>
    <li> I love this Polish! I&#x27;m chasing around a puppy and toddler all day and the Polish is doing great! Certainly a good buy! Not damaging my nails or surrounding skin. Buying new colors soon! So far only using 270 street flair. Very soft purple. Also used the top coat over my regular polish and it helped keep the Polish strong!</li>
    <li> Used the polish and gel top coat. If you don&#x27;t put two coats of polish (and let them dry thoroughly ) the polish streaks and ends up on the top coat brush. It did last longer than anything I had used before but labor intensive. As I have read in other reviews about the gel brush falling apart...yep, mine did after four uses. Walgreens replaced it with apologies, but I do think this is a serious design flaw. Brush falling apart makes this product completely useless.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Looks horrible and started chipping after the first day. I&#x27;ll go back to the gel polish that requires the lamp.</li>
    <li> Definitely works better than regular polish but not sure if thats attributed to the top coat or a combination of the two.  Lasts at least two weeks as a PEDICURE but chipped off after four days on my fingers.  Still better than regular polish.  I would give it 3 stars for manicure and 5 for pedicure.</li>
    <li> Far too expensive and doesn&#x27;t last the day. Part of appearing well groomed (to me) is to have nice nails. If colored, they must be fully colored. Not chipped or streaked. I was excited that Sally Hansen offered a Gel process that did not require a light.  I foolishly purchased 5 colors (my mistake)and the top Gel Coat. This was an expensive day in the cosmetics department.  The polish is thin and takes at least 3 coats for good coverage. The Gel coat actually seems to thin the color during the application (and transfer the stain into the Gel Coat bottle. Good luck changing colors). I was very careful to dry my nails between coats. Sadly, within a couple of hours I had chips. I touched these up only to realize even worse chipping again... less than an hour later. In some instances the entire color would fall off as if it was an artificial nail. I tried all the colors and none seemed to fair any better than the #470 Red.  Although I like other products by Sally Hansen....this is definitely NOT one of them. I would like to recoup some of the money spent and will be contacting the company directly shortly. I would NOT recommend this product to my friends or family.</li>
    <li> I bought the gold color and was so impressed with how solid the color was. I never review products but this one deserves it! I am an RN and have never been able to wear polish bc it chips so quickly that it&#x27;s not worth doing but this stayed on without a single chip for 4 days worth of work then another 3-4 days of play. Thoroughly impressed with it and plan on buying more colors!</li>
    <li> After reading all the advertising and a few glowing reviews, I had high hopes for this Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Topcoat. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m particularly hard on nail polish. I have a desk and phone job and I&#x27;m sort of lazy about vigorous housework. But I can never seem to keep nail polish from chipping for more than a couple days. I thought this would be the one. Finally. Alas, it was mostly all hype because this extended the wear by maybe a day or so. I&#x27;m really disappointed because I love black nail polish and purchased the Sally Hansen Gel Polish in black to go along with this. Black is like the worst for showing chips and imperfections. So I&#x27;m really bummed that it didn&#x27;t last longer. I&#x27;m coming to realize that &amp;#34;Up to 2 weeks wear&amp;#34; means anywhere from 1 day to 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good thing about it is that it&#x27;s pretty easy to apply and dries to a glossy, shiny finish. If only it lasted even a week I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I really hoped that I finally found a nail polish that would last a day before chipping - especially paying $10 a bottle. Either I&#x27;m too hard on my hands or my nails are jerks, because this lasted only slightly longer than a day before I got chips at the tip of my nails. Tried 2 colors and felt like the red was worse than the purple - even tried 2 coats of the top coat.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent and the manicure lasts at least a week but there seems to be a problem with the  brush of the top coat. I bought several bottles and all the brushes fell apart after 3 o 4 uses. This happens only with the top coat, not with the polish.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this new product as I do my own gel nails at home and thought this would be easier, however, I returned it yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;It only lasted one day and then the tips wore off on two fingers.  I wasn&#x27;t even doing anything other than every day chores, so no unusual wear and tear.  Unfortunately, the product is a bust, and I would not recommend spending the $16 for the two bottles you need to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I am sad to have to write this review but it&#x27;s the truth. So far, I guess there&#x27;s no short cut for the light!</li>
    <li> Scary stuff! I used it twice... The first time was okay it lasted 4-5 days before peeling. The second time it started to peel the same day but worst of all I noticed my nails were very thin and bending in half. I even had shooting nerve pain down my thumb because I think this polish thinned out my nails so much. I liked how fast it dryed and the finish but not worth the pain and damage that was done to my nails :(</li>
    <li> This is the worst nail polish I have bought. The polish was chipped on the fourth day. When applying it is not smooth and it doesn&#x27;t  cover properly. My natural nails are very hard but after 5 days my nails are peeling. I will go back to Essie.</li>
    <li> Cons: Bubbles appear a lot with the color and top coat; the polish cracks rather chips and takes your nail with it so you left with short nails&lt;br /&gt;Pros: drys fast; has the potential to last at least five days if you apply another clear coat half way through the week when you start to see the cracking happen.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find a polish to avoid those $40 trips to the salon for gel nails. This stuff? Not even close. I had chips on the end of my nails after 2 days. I told my daughter about it when I purchased it and she tried it as well. We sent each other the same photo after two days: we both had chipped nails. Back to the salon :(</li>
    <li> I have had this on my nails for 3 weeks. I can&#x27;t believe how long it has lasted. Wanted to protect my nails before getting married at the end of this month. This stuff really did the job. I&#x27;m not easy on my hands, I highly recommend</li>
    <li> This gel did nothing for my nails. It didn&#x27;t keep the nail polish longer , it actually damaged my nails. The item is overpriced and its false advertisement.</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed in the performance of this product! It took forever to dry, started showing wear around the edges on day 3, had chips in the color by day 4. It does NOT perform or hold up like a Gel product and really doesn&#x27;t last or perform any better than regular polish.  I am going back to Gelish!</li>
    <li> I have never had a gel manicure just to be clear so I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s like or how long it lasts. I have 3 small children ages 4 and under. So my hands are busy and in and out of water constantly throughout the day. Normally if I put on nail polish it is all chipped by the end of the same day. With this it takes days for the polish to start wearing away at the ends. I still do not have any chipping days later. I have used this top coat on the sally hansen gel polish but I&#x27;ve also used it on other brands of nail polish and it works great with both. I found you have to let the polish completely dry first otherwise the top coat might smear the polish a little....sort of expected that for some reason. Keeping up with my nails is hardly something I really have time for but now that I found this top coat I have made the time because I know it will last more than 3 hours with my kids!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Now it does not last 14 days as advertised, but my nail polish lasts about 10 days. I am a mother of 3 and hold a desk job with a great deal of typing involved. So you can imagine between housework and office work, my nail polish tends to take a beating. And I use it over ANY polish brand I have. Like most reviewers have stated - WAIT UNTIL YOUR POLISH IS FULLY DRY. Otherwise, it will move the polish around and cause uneveness. It does take a while longer to dry than most top coats. Has saved me money in the long run since I no longer need a nail salon gel manicure and no UV lights. I can go to bed feeling a little safer at night.</li>
    <li> I bought number 310 it did not have a brush in it</li>
    <li> this IS NOT JUST LIKE getting a gel manicure...should not be advertised as such</li>
    <li> Dyes pretty quick and prevent from tipping for longer period than regular nail polishes/top courts. However, it doesn&#x27;t really look like Gel Nail.</li>
    <li> For me, the overall result has been that my nails look a bit better for a little longer than using traditional products. But there is a HUGE issue with the quality of the brush in the gel. Upon opening the bottle, I noticed that some of the bristles had come away from the wand…sticking out at a right angle thus rendering the brush unusable. Was able to exchange at CVS once showing them the problem, but the same thing happened with the replacement bottle/brush after 3 uses.  So I have to use a different brush with the gel. Probably won’t  buy another bottle because the hassle is not worth it. Upon reading reviews it seems this is not an unusual problem. Can&#x27;t imagine how the product made it to market with such an obvious flaw.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these and only received one!!!!</li>
    <li> I put a ton of this product and colors on my Christmas list.  I was so excited to overhaul my nail polish with what was supposed to wear beautifully for two weeks.  I never achieved more than two days without chipping.  I sit at a desk all day and design software.  I&#x27;m not doing anything harsh with my hands to cause unusual wear.  Plus,  the polish is very watery.  What I mean is that the color goes on unevenly making it look unprofessional because you can see the brush strokes.  It takes forever to completely dry.  Even the next day the polish can be dented because it is still soft. So disappointed. Now I have to overhaul my polishes again to get rid of all of this brand.</li>
    <li> please offer this cheaper and as a bundle with colors.</li>
    <li> Lasted 2 hours! Hours, not days! Save your money.</li>
    <li> This product does not last!! When applied to colors...actually strips color from nail. Then peels off with barely any force. Horrible product</li>
    <li> I am really rough on my nails and this nail polish has stood the test of time. I wash dishes daily, rough house with my dogs, lift weights/kickbox, and work in a lab that requires me to wear gloves and this polish still lasts for AT LEAST a week without as much as chipping. Normal high end nail polish (OPI, Essie, ORLY...etc) usually only lastS about 3 days on my nails before it starts cracking and chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I started using the gel polish, my manicure usually lasts between 7-9 days and I end up changing it because of either nail growth or because I feel like changing colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews that claim it takes way longer to dry, but that hasn&#x27;t been my experience at all. I usually put 2-3 coats of the color (no base needed) and then 1 coat of the top coat and it takes about 15 minutes to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s worth the price. I buy mine at Walgreens for $7.99 a bottle.</li>
    <li> I have to say...this stuff rocks!! It takes a while to dry but totally worth it.  It stays in for a couple of weeks and I am REALLY rough on my nails.  I went to take it off and thought Id be filing with eye goggles on but it came RIGHT off with pure acetone.  Im buying a LOAD of colors...what a time saver!</li>
    <li> Used as recommended. ships and fall of nail easily.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the Money, i have gotten better results with much cheaper polishes.</li>
    <li> I hate that I spent so much money on this. I purchased the top coat and a nail color that&#x27;s also Sally Hansen miracle gel. It does not last at all. I have better results from using Essie. It chips and doesn&#x27;t last at all. I read great reviews so I tried it 3 times trying to be more careful each time, let it dry thoroughly etc...and each time same results. The color goes on nice and pretty but it doesn&#x27;t last, it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
    <li> As a regular nail polish I like the colors. But as a gel replacer it is definitely a big NO! I brought the nail polish to my nail salon and had my nail tech try it out on me. It chipped after day one. Big disappointment for the price. It survived day one on my toes so far.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last 14 days for me but WAY better than regular polish. No other complaints! I work in a professional environment, so most of the colors don&#x27;t work for me. A little too colorful, but the two light colors I&#x27;ve tried are nice. Removed easily with regular polish remover.</li>
    <li> I love the colours of the polish!  The one thing I didn&#x27;t care for is that it took forever to dry completely it was sticky feeling even the next day even after being in the sun which was supposed to help it harden. I was afraid to do anything with my hands for fear of it smearing the polish. Once it finally did harden the polish chipped by 2 days...I&#x27;m not even hard on my hands...for the price it&#x27;s not worth it considering I can buy regular polishes that are higher quality for the same price think I&#x27;ll stick with regular polish or my true gel polishes.</li>
    <li> Please! This product is horrible! It doesnt stays more than 3 days, does not shine and to take it off completely is a pain in the neck! Dont waste your money</li>
    <li> Definitely a muted finish as others have noted, but the wear holds up. I&#x27;m rough on my nails and the polish stays. I would like it to look more like a standard, light cured gel manicure, but the wear and easy to apply and remove wins the day for me. I also wish there were more sophisticated colors, but I&#x27;ve found a few winners.</li>
    <li> really works!  drys nicely.</li>
    <li> The best top coat I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Application was easy and it dried fairly quickly. It looked great for about two days and it&#x27;s started to crack. It hasn&#x27;t chipped but the cracks are pretty obvious on the light blue I chose.</li>
    <li> People here crack me up, with what &#x27;It only lasted four days.  This is out outright lie to consumers.....&#x27; yada, yada.  Here&#x27;s the thing.  YOU know how long a manicure generally lasts you as an individual.  Everyone is different and there are a host of factors:  Body oils, products you use, how long your hands are in water for a prolonged period, any chores or tasks requiring your hands.  The bottom line is that this product lasts LONGER than other products.  I put the product on 2 days ago and my nails are still chip free.  I&#x27;ve showered a couple of times, have cleaned, done laundry and dishes, and tons of typing and my manicure is intact.  Yes, its only 2 days so far.  Who knows?  Maybe it will last 5 more.  But the point is this, I usually don&#x27;t have an intact manicure longer than a few hours.  I almost always wake up with sheet marks and nails invariably chip no later than the next morning.  So for ME, 2 days going strong is an improvement.  And if it lasts longer - Bonus!</li>
    <li> This does not last as long as it claims. I am on day 3 and just touched up the chips. I do like how it looks - nice shine to it. While I like how it looks, I will not be spending this kind of money (I paid $10 at Walgreens) on it again.</li>
    <li> Polish applies streaky looks really bad</li>
    <li> Just like I saw in other review you can use this with any other nail polish brands!.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this to try! I bought these at CVS (they are 10dlls each, or 14 or for a set of this top coat and a color) I got 3 of the miracle gel colors &amp; this top coat. At first I thought they would only work together, but after weeks of trying them I  figure out this top coat is the only one worth it! (The miracle gel colors are also really great (the color looks fantastic but they are expesive, I own over 100 nail polish of diferent brands and it will work the same if I use this coat with those).    I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star simply, because surely doesn&#x27;t really look exactly as a real gel product, but they are still look very nice and shiny &amp; also because I think they  are exaggerating with the 14 day advertisement. I can say, it would for sure last you 14 days, but if you don&#x27;t eat,shower,clean,  wash dishes, work, move your hands at all :/. If you&#x27;re a normal person like most of us and do use your hands, then you still find this product really great, but not for 14 days long.. I can certanly give it a 4-8 day long period of great nails!... Which it still amazing in comparison with other nail polish coat that promise you not chipping and don&#x27;t work. This one does work! regarding the chiping, I have lasted with the same nail polish around a week and there&#x27;s no ugly chiping, BUT you do get a bit of nail polish discoloration or a small thin line of color removal at the tip of the nails (because you use your hands!it looks like if you just have pass a little bit polish remover on the tip), but it&#x27;s not that that bad, or noticeable and still doesn&#x27;t look as bad as the chipping.  Regarding the shine, its really great as well, they nails do shine!, but I give the shine a 4-6 day period, which for me is amazing, I just reapply after that and nothing happend turns right back as the first day. I have also find its great with the application of glittler nail polish, since that always make nails rough (not smooth texture) you can feel the glitter when touching your nail even after applying a top coat!, and finally this gel MIRACLE did the trick! It does give you a smooth &amp; shine texture after apliying  glittler nail polish so for me that a SUPER plus!!...  Overall like I said, I&#x27;m giving this a 4 star because of the false long lasting 14 day advertisement (they will not stay 14 days intact and shine, with no reapplying) , but I think this still one of the greatest coats I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ll keep buying it when it runs out...</li>
    <li> This top coat works very well. I looked at all the reviews and didn&#x27;t expect the problem I&#x27;m having. The brush is falling apart. Only used it once and half of the bristles are gone. I really can&#x27;t continue to use it. All the polishes work very well and last as advertised. Never run across this problem before. It&#x27;s too expensive to buy another one and have that do the same.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty well and definitely does a better job as a top coat than anything I&#x27;ve used before.  However, the smell is incredibly strong (which I kind of expected) and the tips of my nails still chip after a day or two.  It&#x27;s good, but not fantastic.  Would probably buy again though, unless something better comes out on the market.</li>
    <li> This polish duo method is okay - not bad - but it&#x27;s most definitely *not* a miracle. Also, I find it to be a finicky little application. You apply the first coat of polish...and then you should *really* wait WELL beyond when you think it&#x27;s dry bc if you don&#x27;t, the 2nd coat actually seems to wipe off some of the first coat, it&#x27;s just bizarre! Same w/ the 2nd coat -- let it dry dry dry and dry some more. Because if you don&#x27;t, the top coat WILL actually remove some of the polish -- again very odd and I don&#x27;t understand why this is happening when the polish seems 150% dry. Lastly, wait a GOOD long time for the top coat to dry too. So, this whole set is very finicky in my opinion. And, I live in Phoenix where one would think the dry climate would encourage faster drying, but I guess not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as lasting - I really only get about 5-6 days MAX out of it, and that&#x27;s it. By then, it&#x27;s chipped, the grow-out is obvious, and/or the tips have shown too much wear (despite sealing them w/ the top coat). I&#x27;m not terribly hard on my nails, but I really did expect way more than 5-6 days. So, I&#x27;m kind of disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars for looking very good for the short time it does look good - and the shine is quite brilliant during that time. But I don&#x27;t find it particularly longer-lasting AT ALL, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> new to the gel scene, and it&#x27;s a great product so far.  thank you!</li>
    <li> Never will buy the top coat again!  Waste of money!  Would not dry!  The colored gel nail polish is fantastic, but I use another gel top coat to protect it.</li>
    <li> Nails chip after 2 days :/</li>
    <li> You can get this at target, rite Aid,  CVS, etc for $10.00 y u get 2 for $14.00( the top coat and any color), by the way the product is good, so shiny</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!! Works for me :)</li>
    <li> I used the Grey Matters #290 polish and then this top coat as instructed. The only directions I could find on the bottle, were two coats of the color and one of the top coat. I don&#x27;t know how much waiting you are supposed to do. But even after more than five minutes, the color coat was gooey. So I thought maybe it needs the top coat to \\&quot;cure\\&quot;. Which it seemed to do. After about 12 hours, almost every nail had tip wear (polish worn off at the tips). After less than 24 hours, one nail had chipped. I filed it a little and applied a little more polish, then recoated all nails with the top coat. On a couple of nails, brushing on this top coat wiped off some of the color coat, so you can definitely see through to the nail on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not look like a gel manicure. It looks dull. It does not have that deep, thick, glossy look of a gel manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this manicure Saturday evening, with another topcoat Monday morning. By Tuesday morning, it was toast. The edges were peeling and my little finger had a big chip on the side.</li>
    <li> This topcoat is very good, my mani lasted for a week with no chips. However, it is a lot cheaper in drugstores. It&#x27;s only $7</li>
    <li> Takes nail polish off. Nail polish transfers to the tip of the nail brush. Causes mail polish to be streaky.</li>
    <li> Brush broke on 2nd use.</li>
    <li> I was highly skeptical, but this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> I expected this top coat to have the same consistency and durability as the actual gel used in salons that require a light.  This product peels off my nails in a matter of days and does not have the same quality or durability of an actual gel top coat.  Save your money and go to the salon.</li>
    <li> Never buying again!!! I spent $9.99 for this polish, believing that I will have a nice shine and it would last 15 days as advertised. I applied 2 coats on nails without oily residue, did not perform any heavy scrubbing, cleaning, or soaking, and within hours, my tips were chipping. I applied in the morning, and by afternoon it was a gonner. What a waste! I could have gotten better results with a $1 Wet &amp; Wild and a protective top coat for LESS than $5!!! Save your money and don&#x27;t waste it on this. You get better results with other brands or Sally Hansen&#x27;s original, cheaper line.</li>
    <li> This nail gel doesn&#x27;t work any better then the regular polish. My nails chipped after just 2 days. Save your money.</li>
    <li> The place where I got my nails done charged me $10.00 to apply it.  That night I started itching all over my body especially my neck and lower back area and am still having a problem after four days.  I just got done filing it all off as the acetone did not take any of it off.  Bad reaction to it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product from Sally Hansen.  With her no LED/UV light gel nail polish kit, doing a mani is a cinch.  Just apply the Sally Hansen Miracle activator, watching to avoid what can be irritating fumes, and before the product is dry, apply the Sally Hansen Miracle gel polish.  Finish the mani off with the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel, Top Coat, and  enjoy your nails for two weeks.  This products help my nails that tend to split after reaching a nice length.  Doing housework and weeding does not seem to bother the entire Sally Hansen Miracle Gel set.  And my nails look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the Sally Hansen LED/UV products; however, the Miracle Gel is so much easier and faster to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it.  I feel confident that you will be happy after how long lasting and beautiful your nails can be.</li>
    <li> good...gave a lot of shine...a little hard to remove</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last much longer than any nail polish for me, but that&#x27;s not even the worst part. After using it maybe twice the brush fell apart! I can&#x27;t even use it anymore. Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money.</li>
    <li> stays on great.  easy to do own polish at home</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this top coat. I usually use it with the Red Eye color. I&#x27;m a doctor and work with my hands all day and wash them constantly and I have to keep nails short. I&#x27;d given up on wearing regular polish during the week because it would be chipped/peeling in spots by the end of one day. I tried shellac, which I love, but my nails started thinning and splitting so I only have them for vacations/special events. This top coat works really, really well. If I&#x27;m careful during application I can get about 10 days without any chips whatsoever. The other thing that&#x27;s great is it doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry like some of the other formulas I&#x27;ve tried. I apply two coats of polish, then one to two thin coats of top coat. Main thing is to make sure you don&#x27;t have the top coat spread across from nail bed/edge to skin, because if it dries across, it will start to pull off on the nail when it lifts off the skin. I just touch up with a layer of top coat once mid-week and I&#x27;m good to go. Also recommend using solar oil on nails to keep polish flexible. Helps extend life of shellac as well. Top coat works just about as well over regular polish, too.</li>
    <li> This lasted a week for me. I could have left it on longer, but it started to look a little bit worn on the tips, and I wanted to try other colors. I really liked it until I realized it was ruining my nails. I normally never wear nail polish, so maybe any polish would have done this, but my nails are peeling. I had to cut them short, and I will have to keep them short until the damage grows out. For the record, I changed the polish weekly for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Love these products &amp; so happy not to have to go to a salon &amp; pay for good looking nails anymore:))</li>
    <li> After I bought this product for over $17 I was in Walmart and noticed that their regular price was $7.99 and it was on sale for $6.99.  I purchased one in Walmart and then Amazon&#x27;s order arrived a few days later.  Now I have two but I wasn&#x27;t happy spending twice as much for the Amazon Gel--same exact product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like it however and have tried it out several ways so I couldn&#x27;t determine if it was long lasting.  I was able to put a color (not the Miracle Gel) under the Gel application and it worked fine.  One nail chipped but I might have been in too much of a hurry to apply the Gel and the color might not have been set.  Then I removed all the color and just put on several coats of the Gel alone.  I liked it!  My nails stayed smooth and shiny and they&#x27;ve been this way for several days now.  I bought French white polish and next I&#x27;m going to try a French manicure with the Gel covering it.  However, the plain clear look works very well and I&#x27;m not in any hurry to remove it.  Oh, BTW, it does come off with regular nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> The color is to thin. It leave streaks and looks awful. I tried several coats and it still leaves streaks. I had it on for two days and it started to peel off. It is NOT like a gel at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this top coat.  I&#x27;ve never used it with the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel polishes, just my own polish, so I can&#x27;t comment on those.  I use this a lot with Incoco french manicures and it lasts a week, no chips, before I get tired of it and change my polish because I choose to.  There were times I added another layer of top coat, there were times I didn&#x27;t, and my nails looked good either way.  It does take a bit longer to remove, but I love that I don&#x27;t have to soak as I did with Gelish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I&#x27;ve used the Butter London system, which chipped as soon as I showered, and the OPI, which performed well except for some bubbles, but had a ridiculously strong smell.  I went to bed 3-4 hours after doing my nails with the OPI topcoat and had to keep my hands away from my face because the odor was still that bad.  The Sally Hansen has no downside I can see.</li>
    <li> Not really a gel polish like how it is in the salon but def a great nail polish!!! Last longer than a reg nail polish and goes on very smooth. I would def buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now. The polish really stays on for two weeks only nail growth shows but I fix that with filing. I have one tip that I use that I feel helps the polish last for 2 weeks that is I soak my bare nails in white vinegar for. 15 minutes before I put polish on and it removes any oils on nails. I put 2 to 3 coats of color on ( depending how I want coverage  ). I wait a few minutes between coats and add.  1 coat top polish and let it dry for 15 minutes then it&#x27;s really dry to the touch.  So far I have seen no damage to my nails .  And they are as hard as gel polish.</li>
    <li> Painted on Friday, polish peeled off first nail on Tuesday.  Three more the next day.  Took it off after that. Didn&#x27;t last any longer than regular polish. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail product I have found, ever!  First of all, I have not used any of the miracle gel colors, only this top coat. I am sure it is the intention of Sally Hansen to sell the color and top coat together but it is not necessary to buy the miracle gel colors. I have a lot of colors from OPI, Essie, etc and I wanted something I could use with them as well.  So I purchased the top coat just to test and see if it would work with other polishes. It works great so that is a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many other positives as well. First, the top coat gives a nice glossy finish to your nail, just like a gel manicure from the salon. It is also very hard when dry. I have a huge problem with nail breakage and tearing. My nails are very thin and rip at the base very easily. Polish alone usually does nothing to help. However, this top coat forms a great barrier and gives my nails strength. I have had no breaks or tears in the two weeks or so I have had the product on my nails.  It comes off with regular nail polish remover. Most gel manicures require special remover and can be difficult to remove so this is another big plus.  Probably the best plus for me is that it dries insanely fast. I am super impatient when it comes to waiting for my nails to dry so I love this aspect of the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big question for people will definitely be &amp;#34;does it really last for 14 days?&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m guessing the Sally Hansen company would only stand behind that claim IF both steps were used, meaning a step one miracle gel polish and the top coat together.  Plus, I honestly don&#x27;t like to wear the same color for more than a week anyway so I don&#x27;t really expect 2 weeks of wear. Having said that, after 1 week of use (I changed the color after the first week), I have no chips and have had no peeling. I am a SAHM so I do lots of housework, cooking, dishes, yard work, etc and am constantly using my hands.  I have noticed a slight, and I mean slight, bit of wear on thevery tips of my nails.  This is only really noticeable if you look for it but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.  I have read from others that have used the product that applying it to the tips and underside of the nail will help with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I had to share my success with is product. Mainly, I wanted people to know that you can use your favorite colors from other brands and this top coat will still work wonders with them.  As far as tips, I applied a very thin first coat, let it dry completely, applied a second coat for complete coverage and also let it dry completely.  That is very important, your color coats must be completely dry before applying the top coat. The top coat will smear and take off color on nails that are not dry. Once color is dry, add one coat of miracle gel top coat and that&#x27;s it. Very simple. Give it a try, this product could save a bundle on salon manicures.</li>
    <li> Crap, no better than Wet and Wild. Chipped after only 2 days!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has lasted two weeks for me no problem.  You can purchase this at your local WalMart for $7.50.  I have bought several colors.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target...I absolutely LOVE this polish.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but am urged to write one based on the product.  I polished my toes two and a half weeks ago and they still have not chipped.  I wear sandals nearly every day and it continues to look like I just went for a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;The polish on my fingers did not hold up as long, but that&#x27;s understandable because I am washing dishes and such but it sure did hold up well over a week!  Definitely better than any other polish out there.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great way to save time and money on all my manicures &amp; pedicures!</li>
    <li> I bought this top coat gel in a kit that came with 2 polishes and cost $20. Since polish never lasts more than 2 days on me I thought if I get 4-5 days out of it I&#x27;ll be happy, it lasted 2 days. On the pro side, love the colors and the shine, on the con side it chips just like regular nail polish.  I will use it until it&#x27;s finished, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not at all like gel nails - not even close.  The top coat is a bit thicker than other top coat products.  Dries soft - not at all like real gel nails.&lt;br /&gt;Misleading advertising.</li>
    <li> I have tried every polish and method under the sun.. While the miracle gel line does look very much like a true gel manicure, i don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re close to finding a regular polish that lasts like one yet still has easy removal.. That being said, if i wipe my nails with alcohol before applying, this polish lasts about a week with a small touch up somewhere in the middle, mainly for shine as it tends to dull a little. Removal is a breeze.. And, why i give it four stars.. If you&#x27;re a use of another brand that doesn&#x27;t dry quick enough and you get those nasty sheet marks, this is your answer. Strong top coat that dries quickly with high shine. We are getting closer to that perfect miracle nail polish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this both with the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel polish and as a top coat with other polishes (Rimmel, OPI) and I&#x27;ve found it to be very shiny and long-lasting. With SHMG Polish, as toenail polish it lasted more than three weeks. I think it&#x27;s important to prepare the nail well, so I use OPI Nail Envy as a base coat every time. It&#x27;s also important to let the polish dry completely before you add the top coat, at least when you use a non-SHMG polish. Great for smoothing over flubs and accidental marks!</li>
    <li> This honestly was a waste of money. It only lasted 2 or 3 days and if you don&#x27;t paint it perfectly right, you end up with what looks like uneven layers.</li>
    <li> This is easily the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s shinier than my expensive OPI top coat, and lasts so much longer. The shine is seriously gorgeous. I use it over any nail polish and it makes my nails look so professional and pretty! Not to mention it lasts so much longer, no chips worn down tips at all. I take hair, skin &amp; nails vitamins every day and my nails look and feel healthy and strong. This top coat is literally just the icing on the cake! Seriously worth the money. It looks amazing on my fingers &amp; toes. My toes stay looking like I did them earlier that day for ages!</li>
    <li> Tried it twice now with two different colors.  Lasted for 5 days, which is about as long as any pigment with any top coat for me.  Very very disappointed that I wasted money on this sham.</li>
    <li> Chipped first day.... longest I have ever had to wait for a nail polish to dry. Very expensive. Not many decent colors. This will be the last Sally Hansen purchase I will ever make, their products have didisappointed me in the past.</li>
    <li> Over Sally Hansen color or your own nail polish (let completely dry first), this gel as a top coat is great!</li>
    <li> It works!!! I was very skeptical to try this. However, it has been two weeks, and my nails are still chip-free and strong!!! I garden, swim, do dishes...and I am an artist constantly cleaning paint off of my hands. I am so happy that I found this!!! Try it, for sure. PS...I applied it over my regular nail polish and it works wonderfully! :)</li>
    <li> The top coat is the only part of the SHMG system I liked.  My first experience was a pedicure with Red Eye, which lasted nearly two weeks in sandals. Based on that trial, I purchased several shades, and regret it now.  On my hands, polish requires at least THREE coats to cover nicely, and then chips and fades quickly after day 3 or 4.  It also dulls, caused partly, I&#x27;m sure, by normal handwashing. Whatever. I&#x27;m going back to regular polish (some of my faves ARE Sally Hansen) and top coat.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time, it didn&#x27;t last 24 hours let alone two weeks.  Something that is too good to be true, is usually a warning sign.  I should have trusted my stay away from this product instinct.</li>
    <li> The polish didn&#x27;t last.  On the third day the polish started to peel around the edges.  Plus the polish glides on too watery and makes the color uneven.  You can see the brush strokes too clearly.  I prefer Revlon&#x27;s Gel Envy.  It lasts longer and the colors dry evenly and that makes it look professional.</li>
    <li> Dries the color nicely.  No need for UV light.  Just used it for first time.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Not any better than any other top coat.  Have been trying it for several weeks and nail color chips the sme as it always does.  No more protective.  Too expensive to not work.  Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> This review is for Sally Hansen Miracle Gel - Top Coat and Color.  I had such high hopes, but I was very disappointed.  It may have the GEL name on it but I felt it was just your standard polish.  Polished my nail at 6am on a Tuesday and by Thursday afternoon I had a chip on two of my nails.  I followed the instructions, let it dry between coats... still chipped a lot quicker than I expected.  I went in thinking, if I can get at least 4-5 solid days I&#x27;d be sold.  The only reason I gave it two instead of one star... the colors are nice and the top coat is shiny.  Not that the topcoat helped in any way with the chipping but it was shiny.  Oh and the biggest thing you should note... when you go to a salon to get a gel manicure, it makes your nails a bit thicker - harder.  This was the same as any other polish - no hardening effect whatsoever.  That was the most disappointing part for me.  My take - back to the salon I go.  Gel manicure is $20 weekdays... its worth it for 14 days of color.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money. Does not work.</li>
    <li> I normally like Sally Hansen products but this Miracle Gel polish chips after 1 day. The Extreme wear polish lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say how long this last soay update this later. My first impression isn&#x27;t a good one. I just applied this today and used only one coat of each and it appears to be too thick an hour after applying i was getting some cash out of my pocket and some of the polish ended up pushed down. Someone said on here the polish is too thin I also see brush strokes after applying. I am not sure how it can be so thin that brush strokes are visible yet so think that once dry it will clump together. Pretty color but no way worth the fifteen dollars I paid for it. I would not recommend this to a friend waste of money.</li>
    <li> I NEVER write reviews but feel this is a must. I have now bought 3 colors and they have all went on smoothly with no issues. Always need 2 coats. No chips until about 8 days after application which I feel is great and worth the price. Comes off easily. I will not get Shellac as long as this product is available. Love!</li>
    <li> Yes, I have reviewed three of the other colors I&#x27;ve tried, so this review may look familiar.  But it&#x27;s because my nail polish never stays on more than 3 or 4 days and this one has really worked for me I wanted to make sure to share all my tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does it really stay on 14 days?  Yes it did for me, but I was on vacation so no cleaning around the house.  I get closer to 10 days before I decide I want a new color and the new growth is just too much.  We did a big scrub and clean of the house this weekend and my middle finger on the right hand kept hitting things and I broke the tip of the nail.  I think if I had filed it right away and put a top coat on, that it would have been fine. My left hand and most of my right hand hung in there like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and so far the 3 colors I&#x27;ve tried did not discolor my nail bed so I&#x27;m following the directions and not putting a base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1-Worked best when I did one nail at a time appling topcoat to the leading edge of the nail, and then over the whole nail.  Sealing it on the end made it last even longer when I was back home cleaning and back at work typing.&lt;br /&gt;2-Go ahead and add top coat every few days and reseal the edges if you are hard on your nails.  It dries quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3- It didn&#x27;t look good when I tried to add a coat of color to compensate for the new growth.  It did look better, after about a week I filed my nails to take care of the slight chipping, sealed the edges and applied topcoat over the nails.  (I&#x27;m not trying to grow them and I really am super tough on my nails.)&lt;br /&gt;4-  If you break/chip a nail, then get it filed quick and put a layer of topcoat on sealing the edges!</li>
    <li> Did not even come close to Gel Nail Polish</li>
    <li> I bought this top coat with the pink tank color (which I love) from Walmart. Tried it on my toes and it lasted three weeks, obviously it grew out and I needed to replace it, but that was the first time a nail polish has stayed on that long for me. I have a toddler, a newborn and a needy husband, so I am very busy and don&#x27;t have time to do my nails frequently.</li>
    <li> Takes forever to dry like I mean forever I&#x27;m sitting here 30 mins later with wet nails still. I wait at least 10 mins in between coats. Half the time they never dry after hours of wait time and I put on the thinnest coats of pain and top coat. When I finally get a nice dry nail they do look nice but do not last 14 days no way. I often wonder if a light lamp dryer would make this process faster.</li>
    <li> I started using these about 3 or 4 months ago. At first, I LOVED the product. No, it doesn&#x27;t last 14 days, but it would last the entire work week looking good. And I wash a lot of dishes and wash my hands frequently at work. So I was impressed. Plus, it dries quickly and comes off easily making it not too hard or time consuming. But after a few months, my nails all started cracking and peeling. And they have broken off so that the are all very short. It&#x27;s been a month since that started and I have tried all kinds of things from strengthening polish for damaged nails to vitamins to strengthen hair and nails. Nothing has worked so far. They just keep peeling and breaking. It&#x27;s also left my cuticles and the nearby skin in terrible shape.</li>
    <li> Barely lasted two days! What a waste of 20 bucks for a bottle of polish and topcoat. Also is not shiny like gel. Finish was muted. Won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I used this with the black miracle gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color- Nice strong black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went on easy and smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem, I work as a nurse, was chipping after first  shift, including one nail broke, I had to clip 3 nails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my toes, it&#x27;s fine, think it may last longer than normal polish, but if you wash your hands often,  forget it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the 8th day of my Miracle Gel manicure and I haven&#x27;t had even the hint of a chip.  And the shine is still intact.  This is definitely a revolutionary product.  I usually wear light shades because chips are less noticeable.  I purchased Truffle Shuffle, a neutral medium brown shade (perfect for the workplace) and it&#x27;s still going strong.  This top coat and individual colors sell for $8 to $10 in the drugstores and the duo sets, which include the top coat, sell for about $16.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the investment.  The magazine reviews boast of two weeks wear without a chip and I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to that.  I haven&#x27;t babied my manicure at all.  I usually have a manicure every 6 or 7 days and have many nicks and chips at that point.  I took the Miracle Gel polish and top coat to my salon, and I&#x27;m sure that upset the manicurist somewhat, given that she charges more than double for a gel manicure.  But what could she do?  The polish went on smoothly and dried in the same amount of time as regular polish.  It also comes off with nail polish remover, which is better for the nails than having it filed off. I did use a base coat, however, but I understand now that that&#x27;s not necessary so next time I&#x27;ll not do that and maybe I&#x27;ll get even more wear. There are about 25 colors and a few more sold in duo sets. I&#x27;m sure the company will add new shades as the product gains popularity.  I would like to be able to wear dark polish, a nice red or burgundy or even black, and not have it chip.  If I can go 8 days without a single nick or chip and do so without having to baby my manicure, then I&#x27;m definitely sold on this product.  I plan on cleaning the kitchen today (a dirty job) and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to wear gloves.  I&#x27;ll see whether my manicure stands up to this punishment.  So far I certainly haven&#x27;t done anything special to protect it.  The shine is still there, although it&#x27;s not as bright as it was in the beginning so I&#x27;m wondering whether or not to paint on a coat of the top coat just for added shine.  I haven&#x27;t read anything about not doing so, so we&#x27;ll see.  In any case, lasting 8 days without a chip is an amazing feat.  I usually head to the salon after 6 or 7 days, at which point my manicure has many, many chips.  Maybe this product can save me some cash.  So far it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.  My only question is, What will I do with all the regular polish I&#x27;ve collected over the years?  It was a sizable investment.  I guess I can always use that polish for my pedicures, which never chip.  In any case, I&#x27;m sold on Miracle Gel.  I will update this review at the two week mark.  However, I like to change colors frequently so I may choose not to wait that long.  In any case, 8 days without a single chip or nick is surely a feat.  I highly recommend this product.

    <li> It dries fast and goes on smooth,but &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is something of a misnomer; it&#x27;s nothing like professional gel nails. It comes off very easily with acetone so if you like doing your own nails, this may work for you.</li>
    <li> Very nice &amp; would buy.  Price was a bit steep compared to in stores.</li>
    <li> I finally have nails that I see growing to a nice length. Polish stays on sooooo nicely   Sure it does not create the thickness and strength of gel that uses a UV light I didn&#x27;t expect that.  But it is so quick and easy to use AND removes so easily with regular polish removers and a cotton ball...no soaking..  I did a do it yourself UV kit and burned one of my nailbeds - so I gave up on gel.  Then I saw this advertised recently and gave it a try.  I have VERY soft nails that no polish stays on more than 24 hours without chipping.  This has been on 7 days so far. Of course the nails on my active fingers have had some wear away the tips -as  expected but NO peeling or chipping. I just follow up with some maintenance touch ups.....easy  I originally thought that you has to use their polish being sold with this topcoat so I did...but any color polish responds well with this topcoat.  This is a miracle product....LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
    <li> The bad: You know the saying \\&quot;always under promise, then overachieve\\&quot;... well, the marketing department at Sally Hansen decided not to follow it. In their website they argue \\&quot;up to 14 days of color and shine.\\&quot; The name doesn&#x27;t help either... Particularly the GEL part. All of these things lead to overinflated expectations by the costumer, who is clearly entitled to assume that this product is going to behave exactly like the light activated gel polish... If not better. Well, it doesn&#x27;t. Period. However...  The good (miraculous indeed): on its own merits this is a FABULOUS  product. I have never come across something exactly like it. I have no time to deal with my nails. As often as I can, a few minutes once a week, I try my best. Before this product, my best efforts never  looked anything close to a professional manicure. The only way to achieve that would be to use decent products and sit still for about an hour or so. I simply can&#x27;t sit around for that long without messing things up.  MIRACLE 1: With the miracle gel colors and top coat I spend literally 10 minutes waiting for what looks like a very decent manicure to dry (no sun needed... I do it Sunday nights, 2 color coats, one top coat).  MIRACLE 2: Two weeks in a row different people asked me where I get my manicure done. MIRACLE 3: My nails have indentations which contribute to fast peeling of normal nail polishes. The rubbery texture and coat thickness of the miracle gel allows me to forget about my nails for a full week without a single chip. (I don&#x27;t wash dishes by hand. sometimes I add a topcoat layer midweek -5 minutes on Wednesdays- to refresh the manicure).  In sum, if you are willing to pay a bit mor for this polish and you are expecting similar results, I think you won&#x27;t be disappointed. PS. Different colors have different consistencies, some are a bit streakier than others, but nothing that two coats before the top coat can&#x27;t solve (that is how I use most of them...I also clean my nail bed with alcohol before application).</li>
    <li> Love this top coat. I use it with all my nail polishes, I&#x27;m busy, it lasts a minimum of 1 week, 10 days max, but my nail polish usually lasts one day with other top coats.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I like the line of SH over Revlon&#x27;s gel envy even though this is more expensive because it goes on without bubbling and tends to last longer than Revlon, on average about two - three days longer. I&#x27;m getting a business week out of it and that&#x27;s good enough for me. Fourteen days? Well, for women with a cleaning lady and a nanny maybe. The brush is also more pliable than that of the gel envy line. Do store it in the dark when you&#x27;re not using it to prevent it from curing. But I have to say this about both Sally and Revlon, the polish color you&#x27;re using seems to make a tremendous difference for either company. SH Mad Women? Great! Street Flair? Merely okay. Revlon&#x27;s Hot Hand? Hot Damn! Their Royal Flush? More like royally duped. So I&#x27;ve had hits and misses in both lines. Sally has had more hits that Revlon has.</li>
    <li> I was crazy excited to see this new Salley Hansen Miracle Gel polish!  Most nail polishes start to crack and peel within one to two days on me as my hands are constantly in water, shuffling papers at my job or typing away on a computer.  The wear and tear on my nails on a normal week for me basically means that getting my nails done is a waste of time and money as even a professional solar nail color only lasts a week and perhaps a day or two.  After that it&#x27;s cracks, and unless you go back to the salon, it takes forever to get the rest of it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to do my own French manicure using the Mod color and the clear top coat.  I lightly brushed three nails with the Mod color after my nails were ready for painting, and was going to go back over the line with a Q-tip dipped in polish remover to help make a solid line, and erase any mistakes. My surprise was imminent when I realized the polish was almost dry by the time I painted three nails, and was trying to rub the Q-tip over the lines.  So this dries very quickly, which is great!  But I did go over my nails twice to make sure the white wasn&#x27;t thin, and I tried putting just a smudge of polish on a place I missed by going sideways with the brush.  Definitely a mistake.  Since the first layer was pretty dry, the sideways lines were very visible.  So I had to go over it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the biggest question is does this product really work?  The answer...pretty well, but it does depend on how much wear and tear you put your hands through.  I&#x27;ve washed so many dishes this week, scrubbed the floors, etc., that I&#x27;m pretty amazed that it has lasted for a full seven days.  Yesterday I did notice the clear top coat easing up on the sides (not the tips) as you get a more translucent color when paint starts to rise from the nail.  Normal nail growth helped this along also as my nails grow pretty quickly. But today it actually started peeling all around the sides of my nails.  The actual Mod color on my tips still looks great though, and seriously, if I just add another layer of top coat I can more than likely go for another week.  The only other brand that has stayed on my nails for at least five days is Rimmel&#x27;s 10 day color.  And everyone around me did believe that I got my nails done at a salon!  I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth it for the extra days I get out of it, and unless you hold my hands up close, they still look great!ps still looks great though, and seriously, if I just add another layer of top coat I can more than likely go for another week.

    <li> I think this a great product if you don&#x27;t have the money to spend over 30 bucks a month on gel at a salon. I am really rough on my nails,and i pick at my polish so this only lasted me little over a week. When i did take off the red polish i purchased it did stain my nail beds, but just had to go over again to remove the rest. Diff recommend this product. last longer than regular polish, does not last as long as getting your nails done at the salon. but if you are trying to save money use this product. I put 2 coats on and was generous with the color and then put a generous top coat on. Dries really quick!</li>
    <li> Have had regular gel nails which last for 3 weeks and are great. Thought this would be a great alternative but polish started peeling after a few days so was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> So I bought the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel @ Rite Aid for $15.99 for the set which came with the top coat &amp; a beige color. I bought the blue separate since I can&#x27;t live without blue nail polish! I have been wanting to try this out for so long now, i&#x27;ve been obsessed! I love nail polish, especially any color blue, but working with my hands as much as I do nail polish tends to my last me 3 days top. So I am very impressed with how long this Miracle Gel lasted for me! Now mind you, I work with food. So I am constantly washing my hands, wearing gloves and doing the dishes. So anytime I wear regular nail polish by day 3 more than half my polish is off! Awesome right?! I can&#x27;t even tell you how my times a day I change my gloves, wash the dishes or even wash my hands for that matter. Working in food, let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s A LOT. So for there to still be nail polish on my fingers after Day 8 was so amazing! I would seriously recommend this nail polish to everyone &amp; anyone who loves nail polish as much as I do. They have so many colors to choose from! The price is a little expensive for nail polish but totally worth every penny! If this could be my result in 8 days with the job I have, can you imagine how long it&#x27;ll last on your fingers? Head on over to your local beauty store and pick it up! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
