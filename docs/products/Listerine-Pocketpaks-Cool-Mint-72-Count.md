      <li>you aren&#x27;t ready for the strong mint flavor be careful..</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them as a 1.)</li>
      <li>It will give you instant fresh breath and kills alot of the bacterias in the mouth.</li>
      <li>These mints thats soon thin looks like paper even feels like it by touching but sinks in on the human tounge and makes your breath smells twice as good then any tooth paste or pepper mint can.</li>
      <li>you what new technology does.</li>
      <li>Strong, last longer than mint gum , actually freshens breath very well, and you get alot for a low price</li>
      <li>There are several other flavors, most of which are based on mint, though one has a berry flavor.  </li>

      <li>It helps clear up any sinuses or stuffy noses.</li>
      <li>I tried couple of times, but every time after use I had to cough several times as the effect this created in my mouth is so intense.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very expensive at the store (CVS, etc.), but a pretty good deal if you buy them in packs like this.  </li>
      <li>The package is small enough to fit in any clutch or change purse so you can take them anywhere with you.</li>
      <li>this products are very effective, killing bad mouth in just second.</li>
      <li>this thing will overwhelm in the first few secounds.</li>

<li> You don&#x27;t really need a review, it&#x27;s a thin strip that melts instantly in your mouth and has the same effect as mouthwash.</li>
<li> When you&#x27;re single you&#x27;ve gotta be prepared.</li>

<li> It may be good  or bad for you, but not good for me.  </li>
<li> These provide the usual &amp;#34;Listerine burn blast&amp;#34; but I always find that reassuring because I figure if it has that effect on me, imagine what&#x27;s it doing to a tiny little germ!  </li>
<li> These little strip look like plastic but put one in your mouth</li>
<li> kills bad breath fast..</li>
<li> It really does help mask bad breath.</li>
<li> Since it&#x27;s so small, you can carry it in your pocket or purse.</li>
<li> Prime membership is making me lazy.</li>
<li> So yeah, it&#x27;s a little silly to write a review for this.  </li>
<li> No more bad breath.</li>
<li> Therefore I am unable to chew gum for a while.</li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone who gets bad breath during work or school.</li>
<li> Just do remember never offer this to your friends, or they would think you are referring to their bad breath!</li>

    <li> Very strong and minty. It will give you instant fresh breath and kills alot of the bacterias in the mouth. Word of caution tho: it&#x27;s pretty strong. Some of my friends don&#x27;t like it cause it&#x27;s too strong. I like it cause it&#x27;s strong, fresh, and does the job.</li>
    <li> kills bad breath fast.. i you aren&#x27;t ready for the strong mint flavor be careful.. this thing will overwhelm in the first few secounds.</li>
    <li> i love it. i do not have to take chewing gum anymore</li>
    <li> Had these with me while visiting a cousin and she loved them. It was nice to be able to surprise her with them by sending them to her. Cheaper than if I&#x27;d bought them at the store and had to mail myself.</li>
    <li> Very strong..at first..then leaves a very pleasant taste and your mouth feels fresh &amp; clean!!</li>
    <li> In good quality and easy to use.</li>

    <li> Good to have as a breath back-up. Used to use these all of the time and got away from them. They are very strong, Be prepared. Don&#x27;t choke.</li>

    <li> These mints thats soon thin looks like paper even feels like it by touching but sinks in on the human tounge and makes your breath smells twice as good then any tooth paste or pepper mint can. It goes toshow you what new technology does.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it. I tried couple of times, but every time after use I had to cough several times as the effect this created in my mouth is so intense. So, beware of this product. It may be good  or bad for you, but not good for me.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>

    <li> I especially like this product. Also for a change since the manufacturer has a mail in rebate on this, I got this item (3 in fact) for free. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Koustubh, NY</li>
    <li> The Listerine Pocketpaks are very cool and interesting. I love that it melts on your tongue. It really does help mask bad breath. It&#x27;s a little bit too strong for me. It helps clear up any sinuses or stuffy noses. Hahaha!!! It definitely wakes you up in the morning. Since it&#x27;s so small, you can carry it in your pocket or purse.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t really need a review, it&#x27;s a thin strip that melts instantly in your mouth and has the same effect as mouthwash. I always keep some with me.</li>
    <li> I like them but you have to know the trick to not getting it stuck to your mouth roof. Put one on your tougne and keep your mounth open for about 6 seconds. Then close. But don&#x27;t leave them in your pants pocket during a washing machine cycle, you will have a gummy surprise.</li>
    <li> I can rarely find this item in the stores so when I found them online, I was excited. They work like a charm and I will definitely be coming back here when my supply runs low.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because just got my Invisalign. Therefore I am unable to chew gum for a while. These Listerine strips are high-quality strong but not too strong. Does a great job with long-lasting scents. No more bad breath. These may even cover people with Halitosis.</li>
    <li> It came really fast and its great.. i love it..</li>
    <li> very good product and excellent quality. the price was the best, I recommend it to everyone. do not hesitate to buy it.</li>
    <li> A very handy size to keep in your pocket. Freshens your breath really quickly. I keep a pack in the car and in my messenger bag. When you&#x27;re single you&#x27;ve gotta be prepared.</li>
    <li> good mints. these work for me to keep some fresh breath through the day. definitely wont last all day but if you take one every so often you will be good to go. shipping was fast and it came in like a bubble tube shaped thing.</li>
    <li> great product as expected</li>
    <li> Not enough mints for the money!</li>
    <li> This product came through the mail fast. It made my breath smell good, to bad it didn&#x27;t get the ladies. I&#x27;m on my last 25 strips and have up to 3 a day. the packaging was quality and kept my package safe. I would recommend this to anyone who gets bad breath during work or school.</li>
    <li> I love listerine pocketpaks. They freshen your breath and leave your mouth feeling super clean. The package is small enough to fit in any clutch or change purse so you can take them anywhere with you. I keep them stashed in the car, my purse, and all over the house. I received a free sample of the listerine pocketpaks for reviewing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> HOLY SMOKES THESE ARE SOOOOOOOOOO STRONG</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product for testing and review purposes, my opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the convenience of this the tiny little containers of Listerine Pocket Paks.  They are great for stashing in the 5th pocket of your jeans. They work fast and are very strong, so the freshness lasts for quite some time.  I like having the taste and freshness of Cool Mint, without having to carry around a bottle of Listerine with me.</li>
    <li> This is a great portable mouthwash!  I bought it for my girls in mind (they both have braces) and I like it too.</li>
    <li> My family and I all love the Literine Pocketpaks.  Need a quick and delightful refreshing taste....just pull out a strip and enjoy!</li>
    <li> Freshen my breath, but cannot handle above-average warm weather without melting</li>
    <li> As expected. Everything is fine.</li>
    <li> These provide the usual &amp;#34;Listerine burn blast&amp;#34; but I always find that reassuring because I figure if it has that effect on me, imagine what&#x27;s it doing to a tiny little germ!  These little strip look like plastic but put one in your mouth and it melts into instant mouthwash.  I carry one in my purse all the time for those times when you need something to freshen your mouth and breath but you can&#x27;t brush or gargle.  There are several other flavors, most of which are based on mint, though one has a berry flavor.  They&#x27;re all pretty good for what they are designed for.</li>
    <li> Good breath-freshening product. Prime membership is making me lazy.</li>
    <li> Product does what is expected. Packaging could be improved.</li>
