      <li>I feel like this product made my lines more</li>
      <li>It will absorb much better into the skin.</li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t break me out like most anti-aging products have.</li>
      <li>I love the product and the cheaper price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best face product I have ever use, and trust me I have used a lot of different products.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Yes it did work, but do not think I saved any money, since a thicker product allows more uses per bottle.</li>
      <li>This is my third time that I use it, excellent item</li>
      <li>I do not see many (if any) anti-aging benefits however</li>
      <li>I love the product because you can feel it tighten your skin.  </li>
      <li>After using up the first bottle, which is something in itself for me, I know that it is a good product for my skin.</li>
      <li>It has minimized the fine lines around my eyes and mouth</li>
      <li>After that, the fine wrinkles are gone and the deeper ones are smoothing out between the brow and forehead.</li>
      <li>on time a fine quality product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and within about 2 wks my wrinkles and fine lines had soften.</li>
      <li>awesome - might be a little stinky for 5 minutes but</li>
      <li>I use it as instructed and am waiting for the fantastic results.</li>
      <li>My skin has become tighter and it just feels fantastic.</li>
      <li>I will buy it from a Nerium Brand Partner, however, because I know that I can get the product for free if I can get three preferred customers.</li>
      <li>Noticed great improvement in very short period of time.</li>
      <li>you do not get the advantage of getting the product for free if you tell 3 people and they become preferred customers.</li>
      <li>I was given a free trial bottle to try for one week.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
      <li>FABULOUS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>I was given a 5 day free sample of both the day and night Nerium creams and started to apply it on one hand.</li>
      <li>This is an absolutely fantastic product.</li>
      <li>Put it on from neck to forehead lightly, and rub in upward motions.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you put it on while your face neck, chest are damp or right after the shower.  </li>
      <li>and I would recommend it to anyone, its worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Would recommend hooking up with a medium distributor, try it for free, and if u get the amazing results I did, order direct from nerium.</li>
      <li>Honestly, my face feels much better after I wash it with a simple exfoliate.</li>
      <li>I do not believe this was a full container.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d bought this before at full price.</li>
      <li>In doing research the company has  sellers do their best to bury any negative feedback.</li>
      <li>Amazon sent me another, this time full product.</li>
      <li>Came quickly.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>FACE LOOKS SUPER..</li>
      <li>After only five days I couldn&#x27;t be more excited about this product!</li>
      <li>It does work,  in order for someone to really get the true experience you have to use this product for about 3 1/2 to really get the most of the experience.  </li>
      <li>Who wants to pay retail when you can earn free products??</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying</li>
      <li>Found out later that she has natural ruddy cheeks &amp; great skin.</li>
      <li>Worth the money</li>
      <li>totally worth</li>
      <li>is so worth it.</li>
      <li>All these things (and there are more natural things that can go on your face like chamomile and aloe vera)</li>
      <li>This night cream is well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>I noticed results and improvement in skin tone right away.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think this was quite right.</li>
      <li>The box was damaged and I really don&#x27;t feel it was a full bottle.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time ordering it off line and right now don&#x27;t know if I will again.</li>
      <li>It is not a fast working product but once it takes hold it is amazing.</li>
      <li>Already during the first application I knew it was a mistake .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been taught to recognize a pyramid scheme - and this is exactly how it works.</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and the first container lasted almost a month with nightly use.</li>
      <li>, when I use this product consistently, I have no breakouts what-so-ever.</li>
      <li>RESULTS IN FIRST WEEK.</li>
      <li>I literally could not leave this on my face for more than ten minutes.</li>
      <li>Make sure to apply to a moist face, I can definitely tell results!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Save your money, not worth the cost!!!! It&#x27;s so thick it&#x27;s difficult to spread!</li>
    <li> The product would not pump out. My husband had to take it apart and transfer product to another container. I&#x27;m sure some was wasted:(</li>
    <li> The greatest skin care product ever.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with this product. I don&#x27;t see any difference in my before and after pictures.</li>
    <li> I paid $90 for the night cream but recieved the day cream instead which is on $45. Also, this product only lasted about a week and a half before it was empty or the pump broke. Very unhappy with recieving the wrong product!</li>
    <li> Excellent seller! I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and within about 2 wks my wrinkles and fine lines had soften. I have bought just about everything you can imagine to combat the signs of aging on my face and this product is the only thing that has worked! It&#x27;s definitely worth trying</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m bummed. Don&#x27;t know why I believed in this product so much more than the dozen other night creams I have in my bathroom. I really believed that this product was going to work. Met a mom at my kid&#x27;s school &amp; thought her skin looked great &amp; she told me about this product. Found out later that she has natural ruddy cheeks &amp; great skin. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s &amp; my skin is ok. I have larger pores &amp; a few old acne scares I was hoping this would lesson them along with the 3 lines on my chest from tanning over the years. I feel like this product made my lines more defined.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I agree with the reviews about the pump. It&#x27;s very poor &amp; stopped working after 3 weeks, 4 pumps a night.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t suggest purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a couple of years now. I do not see many (if any) anti-aging benefits however, when I use this product consistently, I have no breakouts what-so-ever. I use it for that purpose alone. I like that I can use it at night, and wake up in the morning and just rinse my face. No need to wash my face again in the morning.</li>
    <li> Skin seems brighter smoother. So far.</li>
    <li> Love it. Should have read the instructions though. It says not to put on the soft skin under your eyes and I did. Ouch. :(</li>
    <li> This is the only product that makes a real difference.  I am very impressed with my results.  Now I can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> Received item. However, couldn&#x27;t get anything out. Just a dribble. That was for a few days. Now nothing will come out at all!!!! I&#x27;m so sad as this is a great product. This is my first time ordering it off line and right now don&#x27;t know if I will again. So much money and no product. Just waiting to hear back from seller.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> The box was damaged and I really don&#x27;t feel it was a full bottle.  I am using it as instructed and it is almost empty.  I do like the product, however, I am hesitant buying it through Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Not fresh or something...I love Nerium but I don&#x27;t think this was quite right. Came quickly.</li>
    <li> Hated it. Irritated my skin</li>
    <li> I had tried Nerium from a rep and then ordered this to compare, it&#x27;s real and it&#x27;s awesome!!  Will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> keep going back to using this! skin always looks and feels better after using this product</li>
    <li> It does not have a particularly good fragrance.</li>
    <li> Iam 37 years old and used the cream as a free trial.I was allowed to keep it for seven days.I stop using it after the fourth day, here&#x27;s why.i tend to get really dry skin if it&#x27;s not well moisturize, my skin  is also sensitive .I used this product to help improve some skin discoloration and expressing lines on the corners of my mouth . By the second day of using the product my expressing lines looked deeper, by the third day I develop a slight rash on one cheek and by the fourth day I had dry patches on my cheeks.I used cream as directed,  on damp skin.I then read some reviews online and other customers were complaining about the same thing.some customers suggested to give it time to work that these results are normal.Sorry but I never used an expensive product that made my skin looked worst in four days! This cream is clearly not for everyone, good thing is was only a free trial, otherwise would be a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Too harsh for my skin type, but could work for those with thick and undamaged skin.</li>
    <li> The best stuff ever!!!! Wish it was cheeper</li>
    <li> This s*** does not work, I hate the feeling</li>
    <li> This night cream is well worth the price.  The results are real.  My skin texture and tone has improved dramatically.  The downsize, if you stop using the cream the results will reverse.</li>
    <li> Love it ! It&#x27;s the best face product I have ever use, and trust me I have used a lot of different products.</li>
    <li> After using up the first bottle, which is something in itself for me, I know that it is a good product for my skin. First it softened areas that had started to become a bit leathery on my neck and around the mouth. After that, the fine wrinkles are gone and the deeper ones are smoothing out between the brow and forehead. My neckline doesn&#x27;t sag so much, and the skin feels very different. It was soft before, but now it seems smoother too. I am looking forward to the next two months treatment, after which I will be going to a family reunion. ;-) I have already had comments from the locals here lately that I &amp;#34;don&#x27;t seem to age.&amp;#34; :-D</li>
    <li> Seemed like it was watered down compared to the product I receive ordering from nerium company. Guess you get what u pay for. Yes it did work, but do not think I saved any money, since a thicker product allows more uses per bottle. Also paying extra for expedited shipping did not seem to get it here very fast. Would recommend hooking up with a medium distributor, try it for free, and if u get the amazing results I did, order direct from nerium. A bit more expensive but worth it!</li>
    <li> awesome - might be a little stinky for 5 minutes but totally worth it- my husband noticed a noticeable difference after only 4 weeks - woot woot!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and the label on the box read &amp;#34;Nerium AD Age-Defying Treatment&amp;#34; on it, but the box itself reads &amp;#34;AGE-DEFYING Night Cream&amp;#34; and was not the product that was on the picture. I would like to includepictures, but I have no idea how.</li>
    <li> The bottle was half empty and definitely not the true product.</li>
    <li> FABULOUS PRODUCT. RESULTS IN FIRST WEEK.</li>
    <li> It does work,  in order for someone to really get the true experience you have to use this product for about 3 1/2 to really get the most of the experience.  I&#x27;ll be honest this is not a quick fix, but it definitely alternative with getting the injections.  It&#x27;s something to consider for a long term use that if use this product consistently, and take a picture of before and after during the 90 days. You&#x27;ll be able to see and use the pictures and compare the difference.  The company really spent the money on research and proven clinics trials that NeriumAd works. And it does if you follow the directions.  How can anyone not.  It&#x27;s very simple unless your super lazy to wash your face before you go to bed.  FYI!  Nerium products should not be sale to Amazon, the company is very clear we this rule.</li>
    <li> I tried the 30 day challenge and the first application you can feel your skin tightening. It has minimized the fine lines around my eyes and mouth and I would recommend it to anyone, its worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Product arrived. It&#x27;s empty! Buyers beware!!</li>
    <li> Loved it! Made my skin look and feel amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple months and I have seen amazing results! I look young for my age but this helps, I&#x27;m 51.  Your face NEEDS to be a little damp. Worth the money</li>
    <li> NERIUM, absolutely is wonderful! However, I purchased my second bottle on Amazon and the bottle came empty.  I was so disappointed and as you can see it&#x27;s NOT a cheap product.  So the one star is NOT for the actual Nerium, it&#x27;s the for quality of product that I purchased from Amazon.  Very disappointed and will not buy this from Amazon ever again.  I will buy from the actual Nerium company.</li>
    <li> I have problem skin due to pre-menopause....acne at 45! But Nerium did not make me break out at all and after using it for over a year I am hooked. The bottle lasted forever because you need so little. And as soon as I ran out my skin started looking terrible again. The wrinkles around my eyes are so much worse without it. This is an amazing product. I noticed reviews saying it smelled. Really? I don&#x27;t notice anything and I&#x27;ve had 3 bottles. It&#x27;s not cheap but having something that actually works is so worth it.</li>
    <li> The pump isn&#x27;t working well at all.  Other suppliers, the product just needed 2-3 pumps, now I&#x27;m pumping several times!  I feel that it just doesn&#x27;t work well at all and is very disappointing.  Not sure what&#x27;s going on with the internal packaging of the product.</li>
    <li> I feel like I spent a lot of money for nothing. See no difference whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;on my skin, and feel like I was duped. wissh i could get my money back.....wonder how it did for others ? What a scam !</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely fantastic product. I noticed results and improvement in skin tone right away.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT NOTHING LIKE THIS.. FACE LOOKS SUPER.. DAUGHTER USES WITH ACME PROBLEM IS MUCH BETTER .. GREAT PRICE ON AMAZON</li>
    <li> I have used this product before &amp; have really liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;Dck</li>
    <li> Bottle was cracked and the surim won&#x27;t come out.</li>
    <li> HAVE NOT SEEN THE DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE AS ADVERTISED</li>
    <li> Shipping price is way out of line - much too high</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product!  Have notice noticeably results</li>
    <li> I use it because I&#x27;ve seen its results on others . Can&#x27;t really see less wrinkles on me.</li>
    <li> WOW what a great produt!! I know it&#x27;s suppose to be for the face but I applied it to my abdominal area. The stretch marks are now disappearing and the area is more toned and firm.</li>
    <li> I have been using nerium for over a year. I love the product and the cheaper price was a bonus!</li>
    <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works. Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised. Product does not work period DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
    <li> This is my third time that I use it, excellent item</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 years and it has improved my skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the night lotion! Make sure to apply to a moist face, I can definitely tell results!</li>
    <li> I am a 57 year old woman who was born with eczema and as a result I have extremely thick, dry, wrinkly skin on my hands. I was given a 5 day free sample of both the day and night Nerium creams and started to apply it on one hand. I was fearful because my skin has a tendency to break out with most creams. I have only used Eucerin or prescription creams throughout my life. After only five days I couldn&#x27;t be more excited about this product! I immediately noticed a change in the smoothness of my skin and looking at the before and after pictures there is already a very noticeable change in the amount and size of the wrinkles. My skin has become tighter and it just feels fantastic. For someone who has suffered their whole life with skin that can really be described as painful, I can not tell you how wonderful it feels to have a product that actually changes the way my skin feels and it doesn&#x27;t just disappear after it is applied or feel like I&#x27;m applying a thick grease to the outer layers of my skin. I am not rich but I will be affording this product. I will buy it from a Nerium Brand Partner, however, because I know that I can get the product for free if I can get three preferred customers. I can not imagine someone having no results with this product unless they have no wrinkles to begin with. I realize that perhaps it may not work for some but I am hoping that this review may help someone who really is suffering to see that it might be worth a try. I have never written a review before and I do not sell Nerium but I am living proof that it works.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Noticed great improvement in very short period of time. My pores look less noticeable. Skin tone is even.</li>
    <li> I have been using it, took a while to get the night one, so the jury is still out.  I use it as instructed and am waiting for the fantastic results.</li>
    <li> Item came empty just like one of the other reviewers. Amazon sent me another, this time full product. I have used this for two months and zero difference. Noticed some reviews are clearly from Nerium sellers. In doing research the company has  sellers do their best to bury any negative feedback.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I am happy that AMAZON has the bestprice...</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;d bought this before at full price. Great price on Amazon. Fast delivery. Good quality. I love the product because you can feel it tighten your skin.  Some people say the smell bothers them.  Doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  Do lightly dampen your face and neck prior to application.  The bottle does say that.  I missed that detail the first bottle.  Put it on from neck to forehead lightly, and rub in upward motions.  Didn&#x27;t break me out like most anti-aging products have. Will definitely purchase again. Expensive, but worth it, and some products cost more and are greasy.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample from a friend and that is what made me buy this product! What a difference it has made! My skin is so smooth and the wrinkles have become much more less in appearance.  I would recommend this product to anyone!  Just make sure you put it on while your face neck, chest are damp or right after the shower.  It will absorb much better into the skin.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. I can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
    <li> It is wonderful.. I love what it has done foe my face</li>
    <li> I was really dissatisfied with this product. After using for 4 weeks, I saw no difference. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product!  I love how it tightens and lifts my wrinkles!  It doesn&#x27;t take them all away, but does improve the look of my face.</li>
    <li> Nerium was introduced to me by Chris Hawkins from Shawnee,KS. I am nearly 70 years old but many people say I look more  like I am in the late fifties. It is not a fast working product but once it takes hold it is amazing. Mary Ellen in Lawrence, KS</li>
    <li> I do not believe this was a full container. I have used this product before and the first container lasted almost a month with nightly use. I barely got a week out of this bottle. I love the product. I will not use this seller again.</li>
    <li> I was given a free trial bottle to try for one week.&lt;br /&gt;From the moment I was introduced to this product, I was suspicious. My suspicions were so right.&lt;br /&gt;On night one, I hated the feel of this product on my face. The texture of it, while still on my hand, felt so synthetic. I could smell it inches away from my face. I was told it would smell like &amp;#34;going to a spa&amp;#34;. I have no idea what these people are talking about. It smelled like a mix of burnt rubber, and sun dried rotten cactus. I hesitated putting it on my face, but my curiosity got the better of me. I literally could not leave this on my face for more than ten minutes. The overpowering smell gave me a headache. I scrubbed this crap off and put it back in the box. Honestly, my face feels much better after I wash it with a simple exfoliate. I went to bed that night with a headache that would not go away. I still woke up the next morning with the headache.&lt;br /&gt;NO WHERE around this product is there any sort of scientific evidence that it works, or published results from experimental trials. There are ZERO facts presented honestly about this. It hasn&#x27;t even been approved by the FDA.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to look young forever, try this ladies: Stop giving a crap about what the media says - you WILL age (because there is this thing called TIME), and you WILL wrinkle. ACCEPT IT. Instead, wash your face, apply sunscreen when in the sun, eat healthier foods, get more exercise, stop smoking, be happy. All these things (and there are more natural things that can go on your face like chamomile and aloe vera) will make you age beautifully. Promise.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;ve learned about this product is that there is an entire cult of people behind it that are only looking to suck your entire wallet out of you through their disgusting lucrative schemes. Everyone involved essentially loses their soul to this pyramid scheme. I&#x27;ve been taught to recognize a pyramid scheme - and this is exactly how it works. BEWARE AND DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!!!!DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!!!!</li>
    <li> on time a fine quality product</li>
    <li> I have tried  Nerium AD from curiosity . Already during the first application I knew it was a mistake . If is like applying some sort of glue to your face. After 3 weeks I see absolute no results. No comparison to Obagi products I have been using for about 10 years.</li>
    <li> By far the BEST cream I have EVER used! It minimized my forehead lines within 5-7 days and evened out my skin tone after a week or so and my brown spots seemed less after 1 week...as evidenced by a before pic and after 7 day pic!  I have a ton of friends who have all gotten amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not getting results, its possible the person who sold it to you on amazon had it in their hot car or garage for months and months...or even years! Do not order on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus you do not get the advantage of getting the product for free if you tell 3 people and they become preferred customers. Who wants to pay retail when you can earn free products?? NOT ME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a MUST HAVE! Get the day cream too for faster results!</li>
