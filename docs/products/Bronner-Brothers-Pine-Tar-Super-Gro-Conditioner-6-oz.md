      <li>I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>I tried many things and doctors never want to do anything beyond looking at it and guessing what it is.  </li>
      <li>I follow this healthy hair page on instagram and saw some comments about pine tar</li>
      <li>those thinning areas have filled in quite nicely.</li>
      <li>and I had not idea why it was so strong that it smelled like the aftermath of a fire.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the seller and transaction are fine.</li>
      <li>It should work just fine if it was processed propperly.</li>
      <li>I head has bald spots in it but notice some of them has filled in.</li>

      <li>I love this product it really works.</li>
      <li>Im glad I can order it here, thanks.</li>
      <li>After many years of relaxers, hair pulling, brushing, and braiding, I never paid much attention to my edges until now.</li>
      <li>However it makes your hair very strong, long and healthy...</li>
      <li>and I needed something powerful to remove it.  </li>
      <li>Overall it a good hair product it conditions your scalp and hair very well.</li>
      <li>However, it is still worth it.</li>
      <li>The fragrance of product is just what it is named, but  worth the use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, this product is good, but it did not solve my dark spots (fungus or something) on my head.  </li>
      <li>Black tar is always been a good repair grease for thinning hair or edges</li>
      <li>You get use to it after the first couple weeks.</li>
      <li>Just keep using it consistently.</li>
      <li>Better off going to your local beauty supply store.</li>
      <li>First off bbq campfire</li>
      <li>Been having breakage problems but the first time I used this product, the breakage subsided as well as the shedding.</li>
      <li>I also know that many will used female anti-fungal products to grow hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not trying to grow more hair, I&#x27;m trying to add enough substance to it to allow styling.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly my hairline grew back and ofcourse my patches filled in.</li>
      <li>ONCE YOU GET PAST THE SMELL, ITS GOOD.</li>
      <li>Within a week, I&#x27;m certain my face will be unrecognizable, permanently.  </li>
      <li>this is real.</li>
      <li>And came straight onto amazon (as I do for everything).</li>
      <li>I had some thinning spots in my hair from pressing my hair too much.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, since I cant find it in stores,</li>
      <li>After so much stress on my hair it started to fall out.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really use it much, but I like the product.</li>
      <li>I had a very itchy sore scalp, which turned into a bumpy, itchy, sore scalp.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t know if it would be as effective if left on for a lesser amount of time.</li>
      <li>I had several patches and my hairline was pretty much gone!!</li>
      <li>I used one jar of this in 2-3 months and it work better than all those other pricey products</li>
      <li>Full head of hair, almost approaching a mullet.  </li>
      <li>Therefore, I would use lots of headbands and braids in my hair until I reached a decent amount of growth.</li>
      <li>So if it fits your particular needs, it may work for you.</li>
      <li>I was highly upset!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The Pine Tar has started my scalp to  have new growth</li>
      <li>However, this substance has the unique ability to go back in time, gather up all acne and pimple-related problems I had during puberty, and concentrate them all into a weeklong time period in the present.  </li>
      <li>it gave me instant relief the first time i used it</li>
      <li>The smell is strong and it is a heavy grease</li>
      <li>New growth is in hard to grow edges and at top of head.</li>
      <li>but this stuff leaves your hair so soft &amp; moisterized</li>
      <li>Plus, I am more careful with how I wear my hair making sure not to pull it back too tight, I comb instead of brushing the front of my hair, and no more braids.</li>
      <li>hair is growing like crazy, my scalp is super healthy, so I ordered another jar.</li>
      <li>did so much research on products that say it will make edges grow, such as, Dr. Miracle, ORS, Soft Sheen, Jamaican Castor Oil (this I actually tried), etc.</li>
      <li>I went natural three years ago thinking my hair would miraculously grow back</li>
      <li>I decided to go natural and take the big chop plunge which took some getting use to.</li>
      <li>Its cheaper at the local beauty surply near you.</li>
      <li>Well, it does grow hair back quickly and bring out a little something that may have been blocked - but it will not make bald people have hair again, it will only unclog follicles and allow from some grow that you thought was bald.  </li>
      <li>After a few weeks, I have new growth!!!</li>
      <li>If you can get past the smell woodsy smell its worth a try.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an AMAZING product! I&#x27;m a DIY girl so all my realxing, bleaching and colouring I do at home so ofcourse eventually my hair was bound to give up on me! After so much stress on my hair it started to fall out. I had several patches and my hairline was pretty much gone!! I discovered this miracle in a jar and I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly my hairline grew back and ofcourse my patches filled in. I do also wear a lot of weave so its PERFECT for weave wearers. I&#x27;m currently on my second jar!</li>
    <li> Wow, not only did this have a terrible smell, which I was actually prepared for, but it was impossible to apply it to my hair.  It was so thick and sticky that all it did was make a serious mess of my hair.  Not to mention, it took several washings just to get the residue out of my hair. I can&#x27;t tell you if it will help your hair grow or not, I didn&#x27;t use it long enough and don&#x27;t intend to ever try it again!</li>
    <li> Overall it a good hair product it conditions your scalp and hair very well. And I do believe it helps in growing. The smell you will get use to it. It&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell great but works wonderfully. Been having breakage problems but the first time I used this product, the breakage subsided as well as the shedding. The directions say you need to leave it on for 3 days which is what I do but I don&#x27;t know if it would be as effective if left on for a lesser amount of time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but this price in inflated like times 3. This product runs for like $2.50. Better off going to your local beauty supply store. I have thick long natural hair and this is a great product for maintaining moisture in the hair.</li>
    <li> If you can get past the smell woodsy smell its worth a try. I had some thinning spots in my hair from pressing my hair too much. So I decided the do the extreme chop and those thinning areas have filled in quite nicely. I recommend this product to anyone who have thinning scalp areas it works in a matter of months.</li>
    <li> Smell reminds me of that French&amp;eacute; dog mane.</li>
    <li> This scalp treatment REALLY works it caused me to have to get 2 relaxers in a 3 week period when I only usually get a relaxer every2-3 months! I also purchased a second for my aunt that has lupus and it is affecting her hair and the growth jux like me ! And she is praising me for it ! But I did find it in my local hair store without looking for it for $2.48 and it was the same size jar !</li>
    <li> This is NOT the kind of conditioner I thought it would be. This kind, you put on your scalp and rinse out.  No, this is the kind you put on your scalp and LEAVE ON FOR THREE DAYS.  Three days of your head smelling like a creosote bush.  No thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I did not get that this is a black hair product, so this is unsuitable for me. It&#x27;s supposed to grow hair back, and I am missing little or no of my original hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the seller and transaction are fine. So if it fits your particular needs, it may work for you.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really use it much, but I like the product. I know a lot of people that use it and they loved it. I heard a great things about it I give it a 5*****</li>
    <li> I love it.  It has always made my hair grow.</li>
    <li> Best product ever IT WORKS. MY HAIR GREW AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT ...I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I had a very itchy sore scalp, which turned into a bumpy, itchy, sore scalp. I called my dermatologists office and had a 3 week wait. In the mean time, my hair started falling out in clumps. When I say it fell out, I don&#x27;t mean it broke off, I mean I had bald patches. I called a dear friend who is a licensed cosmetologist. I sent her photos of my scalp and she immediately suggested Pine Tar. I couldn&#x27;t find any in the local hair care stores so I ordered it from Amazon. While I waited for the order my hair was still falling out and my scalp was sore to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my jar of pine tar arrived I shampooed my hair with homemade Tea Tree oil infused medicated shampoo, and applied the pine tar. It really smells bad, but after 2 applications of pine tar my scalp stopped itching. In about 10 days all the sores were healed, and the hair loss stopped. I continued this regimen until I got in to see my dermatologist. My doctor said I had a severe allergic reaction to a conditioner I used. The allergic reaction developed into eczema, which itches like crazy and the constant scratching turned into an infection. I had A LOT going on with my scalp. The ointment the doctor gave me, caused a severe migraine. He forewarned me of that side effect, and let me know if I got a headache to return to the pine tar, because pine tar actually heals the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is growing like crazy, my scalp is super healthy, so I ordered another jar. It is great for my scalp horrible for my social life. I don&#x27;t EVER want to experience anything like what I went through with my scalp, so I will continue to treat my scalp to this wonderful stuff once in a while.</li>
    <li> I have tried too many products to start naming in hopes of regrowing my hair.  After a few weeks, I have new growth!!!</li>
    <li> I have some type of fungus or something on my head and I needed something powerful to remove it.  I tried many things and doctors never want to do anything beyond looking at it and guessing what it is.  I tried this because I know the pine tar is good for dealing with fungus.  I also know that many will used female anti-fungal products to grow hair.  The science behind those working is that it removes fungus from the scalp, while not blocking the follicles, so hair grows again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That same science is what is behind this Pine Tar grease.  I recall my mother using this on her back in the day and I had not idea why it was so strong that it smelled like the aftermath of a fire.  Now I know - because that is what it is!  Well, it does grow hair back quickly and bring out a little something that may have been blocked - but it will not make bald people have hair again, it will only unclog follicles and allow from some grow that you thought was bald.  So it works!  It also makes my hair look neater too.  I am a male with low cut.  I cannot explain why my hair is neater, but it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product is good, but it did not solve my dark spots (fungus or something) on my head.  I just get wind of something called &amp;#34;Dettol.&amp;#34;  I have that coming on the way and from what I read about it, it appears to be the thing that should take care of my problem!  I hope so because it is annoying!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy that loves nothing better than a fresh haircut with a nice crisp lining, so I really care about preserving my hairline! I don&#x27;t know why, but I started loosing a small section of my hairline about a couple months ago, it got so bad that this particular area was completely hairless and smooth. My mom recommended I rub this grease on it, and I must say after about a week of using it, I can definitely see growth coming back to that area. It does leave your head and hands smelling like burnt bacon, but its worth it in my book!</li>
    <li> I have now been using it for a week and it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I went natural three years ago thinking my hair would miraculously grow back but a lot of it fell out around my edges and nape. I thought I was going be bald by the age of 21. I used one jar of this in 2-3 months and it work better than all those other pricey products but this is cheaper at at BSS.</li>
    <li> Made my scalp itch... I also smelled like a walking barbeque all day... soooooo strong pew!!!!</li>
    <li> After many years of relaxers, hair pulling, brushing, and braiding, I never paid much attention to my edges until now. I decided to go natural and take the big chop plunge which took some getting use to. Therefore, I would use lots of headbands and braids in my hair until I reached a decent amount of growth. However, the last time I got braids it made my edges break so bad because they were too tight. I was highly upset!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did so much research on products that say it will make edges grow, such as, Dr. Miracle, ORS, Soft Sheen, Jamaican Castor Oil (this I actually tried), etc. Then, a friend introduced me to BB Pine Tar and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It&#x27;s cheaper to buy from a local beauty store. It&#x27;s not the best smelling but it&#x27;s not unbearable either as others make it seem. You get use to it after the first couple weeks. I only use the Pine Tar on my edges. In the beginning I would use a different hairdress on my scalp to help counteract the smell but now it doesn&#x27;t bother me. The results may be slow depending on your hair growth pattern, but it definitely works with consistent use. The directions says to use 3 times a week, but some weeks I use every day or 5 days a week. Plus, I am more careful with how I wear my hair making sure not to pull it back too tight, I comb instead of brushing the front of my hair, and no more braids.</li>
    <li> OMG! I love using this product so i had to come leave a review for you guys. First off bbq campfire lol exactly but this stuff leaves your hair so soft &amp; moisterized i use this everyday in the morning and at  night i used do gro oil stimulate and avocado  cream if needed and wrap my hair up. Im african american with past shoulder hair thats been chemically treated perm dye fryed you name it and this product i recommend. Oh also it does help with itching and dandruff my hair and scalp gets sooo dry. U will be satisfied with this product ;-).</li>
    <li> I suffer from polycystic ovaries so unfortunately one of my side effects was thinning hair which BADLY affected my edges. I literally had none. I tried everything including vitamins and Jamaican castor oil. Which didn&#x27;t work at all. I follow this healthy hair page on instagram and saw some comments about pine tar so I thought I would try it. And came straight onto amazon (as I do for everything). I&#x27;m so happy I found this. This stuff works, it&#x27;s AMAZING. Just keep using it consistently. I&#x27;m currently on my second jar. Need to buy more!!</li>
    <li> i loved the pinetar, i would recommend it to anyone having problems with flaky and itchy hair. it gave me instant relief the first time i used it</li>
    <li> I love the product! I head has bald spots in it but notice some of them has filled in.</li>
    <li> I love pine tar by B&amp;B my hair grows with this product. The smell is strong and it is a heavy grease but it will make for a healthy head of hair and healthy scalp.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my hair grow.  It grew longer, thicker and stronger.  However, you cannot escape the smell.  You will smell like you have just left a campfire.  However, it is still worth it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do justice to this product as I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it. It should work just fine if it was processed propperly. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
    <li> I love this product it really works.Have been using this for years ,when my edges are in need of a touch up</li>
    <li> My beautician recommended this product and it has been extremely helpful. My hair was chemically damaged and came out all over. The Pine Tar has started my scalp to  have new growth and I am so thankful. New growth is in hard to grow edges and at top of head. The fragrance of product is just what it is named, but  worth the use. I do recommend this product to others with similar problem.</li>
    <li> OVERPRICE!!!!!!!!!! Its cheaper at the local beauty surply near you.Check and compare you will see for yourself it&#x27;s way way cheaper.</li>
    <li> this is a very good product!! my mom always tried to get my sister and i to use it but i hated the smell...its very strong ,it smells like bbq wood...However it makes your hair very strong, long and healthy...I love everything about this product now! even the smell lol...This product been around for over 20 years!!! its a staple product of mine,and a must buy!!!</li>
    <li> ONCE YOU GET PAST THE SMELL, ITS GOOD.</li>
    <li> I have a fair amount of hair for a guy.  Full head of hair, almost approaching a mullet.  I do need a haircut soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use enough of this to cover a fingertip, perhaps once a week.  I&#x27;m not trying to grow more hair, I&#x27;m trying to add enough substance to it to allow styling.  This works well, and I rather like the smell of pine tar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one drawback I&#x27;ve found:  If I accidentally get even the smallest amount of this product on my face, I will have an acne/pimple eruption there, despite any amount of cleaning I do.  I&#x27;m 29, and didn&#x27;t often have problems with acne even when I was in my teens.  However, this substance has the unique ability to go back in time, gather up all acne and pimple-related problems I had during puberty, and concentrate them all into a weeklong time period in the present.  Repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever need to change my identity, I&#x27;ll shave my beard off and cover my face with this pine tar stuff, wait 5 minutes and remove it.  Within a week, I&#x27;m certain my face will be unrecognizable, permanently.  I&#x27;ll probably look like a burn victim.</li>
    <li> hard to find. this is real. also in a useable size that wont have you buying six tmes what you need just to get some</li>
    <li> I really like this product, since I cant find it in stores, Im glad I can order it here, thanks.</li>
    <li> Black tar is always been a good repair grease for thinning hair or edges</li>
