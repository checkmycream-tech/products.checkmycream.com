### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s prone to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;Although I take good care of my hair</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m loving the results.  </li>
      <li>I searched and researched for an effective vitamin to help my hair grow, without breaking the bank.</li>
      <li>I  just finished a bottle of 120, and I must say , I have 3c/4a kind of hair</li>
      <li>Nice</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s even more effective than hairfinity!</li>
      <li>and I think more effective.</li>
      <li>BUT on top of these pills, I am taking fish oil and biotin pills</li>
      <li>I must say I got much better results with these my hair</li>
      <li>My nails and hair look better and better.</li>
      <li>I love it, love love it.</li>
      <li>The pills are also very easy to swallow, have no bad aftertaste and have not upset my stomach at all.</li>
      <li>good very good&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
      <li>I was born with baby fine hair like a lot of the women in my family.  </li>
      <li>They are huge...</li>
      <li>Maybe I saw such great results because I doubled the dosage?</li>
      <li>I was taking Rainbow Light women&#x27;s multi-vitamin (6/day), NatureMade Hair Skin &amp; Nails vitamin (3/day), Align probiotic, vitamin C (2/day) and this twice a day.  </li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>will definitely be buying more!</li>
      <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
      <li>I am never one to write reviews, so the fact that I&#x27;m actually taking my time to write this really shows how effective this product is.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t grow very much.  </li>
      <li>My skin is still completely clear and free of blemishes.</li>
      <li>I hope that later on I can give them a better review.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m still use it didn&#x27;t finish the first bottle ...</li>
      <li>I would say my hair has grown more than 2 inches in length since starting this supplement which is a lot for me since my hair usually NEVER actually gets longer, just more frizzy and puffy.</li>
      <li>For the first time in my life, my hairdresser even asked me if I was taking anything for my hair as it was a lot healthier and longer.</li>
      <li>I went the first week in July 2014 then again yesterday which is the first week of September 2014...</li>
      <li>But with these pills, it grew almost 1.5 inches the first month.</li>
      <li>I realize it will take time to notice a growth in hair, however my nails are stronger are growing to a nice active length.</li>
      <li>Also we noticed tiny hairs sticking out at the top of my head, most likely new hair growth.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really track the first months growth, but I got my color done on Jan 11.</li>
      <li>I know that isn&#x27;t much for most people, but compared to how much my hair grows when I don&#x27;t take it, it makes a big difference.</li>
      <li>I have been taking these pills for about 6 weeks, they work pills are a lil large</li>
      <li>Be warned, these are huge vitamins (see pic next to water bottle cap).</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything (or haven&#x27;t done so in very long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really notice a difference</li>
      <li>I know that isn&#x27;t much,</li>
      <li>The thickness in my hair hasn&#x27;t changed too much</li>
      <li>I noticed with using a water filter and these combined my hair seems sooo much softer, thicker and stronger.  </li>
      <li>Not really a stomachache, more like a heaviness.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than Hairfinity</li>
      <li>Now my hair is thick and it has grown a good six</li>
      <li>I still get a significant amount of breakage that sets me back wen trying to gain length...</li>
      <li>My hair usually only grows about .5 inches every 2 months if I&#x27;m lucky.</li>
      <li>These pills seem to be doing a little bit more than I expected, my nails are so long and healthy, I suppose it may take a little longer for me to be able to write anything about my hair, but the nail situation is a plus</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m already noticing some new hair growth.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
      <li>but then again I&#x27;m only halfway through my first bottle.</li>
      <li>My skin has also being less oily, which is another huge plus to me.</li>
      <li>I only saw positive results.</li>
      <li>She is amazed how much my hair grew since my last visit.</li>
      <li>Havent seen much growth but again its only been 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I put blonde highlights in my hair, which lets me see how much it grows.  </li>
      <li>So far I can&#x27;t tell if it has helped or not.  </li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to grow their hair.</li>
      <li>SO i quit taking them and within weeks my skin was back to normal.</li>
      <li>I am a 37 year old, Caucasian, female.  </li>
      <li>but when I did not take these vitamins, my hair barely grew a quarter of an inch over 2 months.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this products for a few months and it is definitely worth the investment and effort.</li>
      <li>Good,  my hair grows like crazy</li>
      <li>I prefer this one because the ingredients are a little better, but have swapped out about half the time in two years and my hair has still grown and thickened up even with the cheaper vitamin along with this one.</li>
      <li>and if you&#x27;re like me with dry brittle hair i highly recommend gettting some of this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really trying to grow out my hair for the summer and get it thicker and healthier after an extreme cut/color episode</li>
      <li>The first few times after taking them I would feel a knot in my stomach.</li>

    <li> Back in August of this year, I stupidly chopped all my hair off. From 36 inches to less than 1. My hair is naturally thin and a terrible mix of curls/waves. It took me 6 years to get my hair from shoulder length down to my butt. Due to bad diet habits and natural slow hair growth, I knew it would take forever to grow out my mirco pixie cut. I searched and researched for an effective vitamin to help my hair grow, without breaking the bank. I first thought of going with Hairfinity, but reading some of the reviews on how people would have bad acne break outs, I passed. Don&#x27;t need to make my bad skin worse! Then I found these vitamins. I bought 3 bottles, thinking that should hopefully help my hair grow enough to put it in a pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;September 15th I started taking the vitamins. My hair was about 1 inch long in the back, and 3 inches up front. November 20th, today, my hair is 4 inches (a little pass 4 actually) in the back and almost 8 inches in the front! I gained over 3 inches of growth in a little over 2 months!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier! If it weren&#x27;t for these vitamins, I wouldn&#x27;t have seen any growth for at least another 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the vitamins being crazy huge, I had no adverse side effects. My skin didn&#x27;t break out, I didn&#x27;t have any digestive issues, or anything like that. I only saw positive results. Longer hair, stronger nails, and I don&#x27;t have any break out around that time of the month anymore. My skin has also being less oily, which is another huge plus to me. Maybe I saw such great results because I doubled the dosage? Either way, these vitamins do the job, plus more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying more! They have my business for life.</li>
    <li> good very good&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> I saw a difference within 2 weeks and so did my hairstylist!  They are huge... but I don&#x27;t have a problem with big pills.  They don&#x27;t upset my stomach at all and I&#x27;m loving the results.  My nails are growing like crazy too... I hope to see a difference in my lashes soon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this supplement for two weeks and I&#x27;m already noticing some new hair growth. Be warned, these are huge vitamins (see pic next to water bottle cap). The first few times after taking them I would feel a knot in my stomach. Not really a stomachache, more like a heaviness. Now I take them after lunch and it&#x27;s no problem. Unlike other reviewers I have not noticed any skin problems. My skin is still completely clear and free of blemishes. I&#x27;m really trying to grow out my hair for the summer and get it thicker and healthier after an extreme cut/color episode so I hope these supplements keep working as well as they seem to have already.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these supplements for just over a month. i have noticed serious growth in the length of my hair and an increase in volume. My nails have also started to grow way faster and stronger than before. I would say my hair has grown more than 2 inches in length since starting this supplement which is a lot for me since my hair usually NEVER actually gets longer, just more frizzy and puffy. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to grow their hair. The pills are also very easy to swallow, have no bad aftertaste and have not upset my stomach at all.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it has worked</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon and I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything (or haven&#x27;t done so in very long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does not grow 0.5 inch per month. It grows even slower than that. But with these pills, it grew almost 1.5 inches the first month. It&#x27;s unbelievable. 3 times faster than before, at least! I love it, love love it.</li>
    <li> It definitely is making my nails grow like crazy and my hair does seem to be growing a little faster than usual...it usually grows very slowly. :l</li>
    <li> Nice but I&#x27;m still use it didn&#x27;t finish the first bottle ...</li>
    <li> Way to hard to swallow, even cut in half they gag me. Never order again. Cant verify if they work as I dont think I can keep taking them</li>
    <li> I hate to rate this so soon.  So far I can&#x27;t tell if it has helped or not.  My fingernails were so thin that the nail tech&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t even put on false nails.  Also they are so short and brittle and peeling that I can&#x27;t tell from that if they&#x27;re helping or not.  I&#x27;ve been taking them a month the 15th of July.  I hope that later on I can give them a better review.</li>
    <li> For some reason, my hair shedded more and I broke into a nasty rash. Just weird...I will never buy this product again. I gave it a two star because of price.</li>
    <li> I curl my hair everyday and use alot of heat products. It had gotten so bad i would pull out hair so much to the point of being afraid i would eventually end up bald. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and have noticed ALOT less breakage. Havent seen much growth but again its only been 2 weeks. If my hair ends up getting thicker that would make me come back to this reveiw and give it 5 stars. Ill keep using it for now and if you&#x27;re like me with dry brittle hair i highly recommend gettting some of this.</li>
    <li> this actually works.  however you can get it at GNC for just under $13.00  And, there is a GNC everywhere.  If there isn&#x27;t one near you, they charge less than $4 for shipping.  Just so you know</li>
    <li> I was taking this to help my hair and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after 2 months. PLUS I broke out with acne soooo bad. I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it. I tried everything. Then it hit me that It came along when i started these caplets. SO i quit taking them and within weeks my skin was back to normal. I will never take this again and will warn others if they decide to try this. Be careful.</li>
    <li> This product gave me horrible headaches, did not gain any results from it.  Dumb.</li>
    <li> Started taking these Dec 11. I didn&#x27;t really track the first months growth, but I got my color done on Jan 11. it&#x27;s Feb 28 now and my roots are insane. I usually only need to get a color done 3-4 times a years! Much cheaper than Hairfinity and I think more effective. A must try.</li>
    <li> No change in my hair whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this supplement once a day for the past 3 weeks and i already see a difference in my hair and nails.</li>
    <li> These pills seem to be doing a little bit more than I expected, my nails are so long and healthy, I suppose it may take a little longer for me to be able to write anything about my hair, but the nail situation is a plus, I&#x27;ll continue to use them, hopefully I&#x27;ll get the same results for my hair.</li>
    <li> I am a 37 year old, Caucasian, female.  I was born with baby fine hair like a lot of the women in my family.  It doesn&#x27;t grow very much.  I was taking Rainbow Light women&#x27;s multi-vitamin (6/day), NatureMade Hair Skin &amp; Nails vitamin (3/day), Align probiotic, vitamin C (2/day) and this twice a day.  I wanted to cut something out, so I cut this out for 2 months and I regretted it.  I put blonde highlights in my hair, which lets me see how much it grows.  When I was taking these vitamins, my hair would grow about an inch every two months.  I know that isn&#x27;t much, but when I did not take these vitamins, my hair barely grew a quarter of an inch over 2 months.  I decided to quit taking the NatureMade Hair Skin &amp; Nails vitamin and go back to this one and it worked.  I&#x27;m now back to growing an inch every two months.  I know that isn&#x27;t much for most people, but compared to how much my hair grows when I don&#x27;t take it, it makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> My hair was braking and wouldn&#x27;t grow, this made such a difference!! I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
    <li> These vitamins were giving me stomach ache. After a few days of taking them, I had to throw them away :-(&lt;br /&gt;At the time of purchase I didn&#x27;t realize they had not been approved by FDA.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking gnc hair supplements for over two years along with romaine for women. When I started you could see my scalp because my hair was so thin. Now my hair is thick and it has grown a good six + inches. I can&#x27;t always afford this version of gnc&#x27;s hair vitamin so sometimes I get the regular hair skin and nails from gnc. I prefer this one because the ingredients are a little better, but have swapped out about half the time in two years and my hair has still grown and thickened up even with the cheaper vitamin along with this one.</li>
    <li> I  just finished a bottle of 120, and I must say , I have 3c/4a kind of hair&lt;br /&gt;I was on hairfinity for about 2 years and 6 months off and on. an  although  they aren&#x27;t too bad I must say I got much better results with these my hair has grown bout 1 1/2. For me this is supernatural hair growth for just 1 month since my hair grows extremely slow n it&#x27;s prone to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;Although I take good care of my hair I still get a significant amount of breakage that sets me back wen trying to gain length...I must say thank u GNC For these vitamins..also my nails r super hard, and long. This I noticed in only 2 weeks on the vitamins</li>
    <li> these pills are too big they taste terrible they leave a terrible taste in your mouth and always make me nauseous and vomit had to stop taking them.  No noticeable results after dealing with the vomiting for a month</li>
    <li> I have been using this products for a few months and it is definitely worth the investment and effort. My nails and hair look better and better.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it.. Feel like it caused me to breakout&lt;br /&gt;Starting hairbrust in a few days</li>
    <li> I have been taking these pills for about 6 weeks, they work pills are a lil large but the results are worth it.My hair has grown approximately 1 1/2 inches in 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Good,  my hair grows like crazy but i still wanted extra boost .  I noticed with using a water filter and these combined my hair seems sooo much softer, thicker and stronger.  I can go 4-6 months without a hair cut and have zero split ends</li>
    <li> I am never one to write reviews, so the fact that I&#x27;m actually taking my time to write this really shows how effective this product is. I&#x27;m 20 and have always had thin curly hair. I started using this product about a month ago and in this month, my hair has grown about 2 inches in length. My hair usually only grows about .5 inches every 2 months if I&#x27;m lucky. BUT on top of these pills, I am taking fish oil and biotin pills but I was inclined to use this product after I wasn&#x27;t seeing results on those supplements alone after having taken them for about 2 months. For the first time in my life, my hairdresser even asked me if I was taking anything for my hair as it was a lot healthier and longer. The thickness in my hair hasn&#x27;t changed too much but then again I&#x27;m only halfway through my first bottle. In addition to hair growth, my nails have also been gaining strength and length. I was skeptical about this product but trust me, IT WORKS! Way cheaper and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s even more effective than hairfinity!</li>
    <li> Within using this product for two weeks, my face started breaking out, calls to company have not answered my questions, I quit using product and my face cleared up, they should warn you of this side effect, I would definitely&lt;br /&gt;NOT have bought it!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product. It works as stated,my hair stylist has said she will reccomend this to her other clients. No funky after taste either.</li>
    <li> These work! I have tried Biotin by itself and it did nothing, but these pills actually work. I take 2 pills a day and started noticing a difference after I took them for 2 to 3 months. I regularly go to my hairdresser every 2 months....I have been going to her for about 10 years now. She is amazed how much my hair grew since my last visit. I went the first week in July 2014 then again yesterday which is the first week of September 2014...so 2 months. She said my hair grew 2 inches, if not close to 2 1/2 inches, and it&#x27;s thicker. Also we noticed tiny hairs sticking out at the top of my head, most likely new hair growth. I do take a multi vitamin a day but I&#x27;m not as regular with those as I was with these pills, my multi is not a prenatal, just a regular multi vitamin. But I have taking a multi vitamin for years and never achieved these results. So these pills must be what my hair needed. Also my nails are stronger and look nicer...grow like crazy and the skin on the back of my arms look smoother, hardly if any pinkish-red bumpy look to them. I&#x27;m gonna keep taking these.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really notice a difference</li>
    <li> I have been taking faithfully every day and my nails still are brittle, and I notice no change in skin or hair that would make me thankful for this purchase. To me, it is a waste to take. Sorry</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I realize it will take time to notice a growth in hair, however my nails are stronger are growing to a nice active length.</li>
