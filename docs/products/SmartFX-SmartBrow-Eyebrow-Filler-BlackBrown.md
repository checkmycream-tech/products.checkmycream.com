### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Requires patience and practice to apply, but an excellent product.</li>
      <li>This product is Amazing!!!</li>
      <li>It works and blends in perfectly.</li>
      <li>Awesome product.  </li>
      <li>I was impressed</li>
      <li>Excellent product and stays on until you wash it off.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
      <li>Awesome.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!!!</li>
      <li>One of my favorite purchases this YEAR!!  </li>
      <li>and I loved it since then.</li>
      <li>It is a really good filler</li>
      <li>but I loved</li>
      <li>I am very pleased will order soon thank you again Theresa</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love this product and recommended it to my friends!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>If you have sparse brows to begin with, stick with powder (use the kind where you get a dual compact of powder and wax, as this makes the powder easier to control and apply).  </li>
      <li>This product does not run smudge and stays in place even while submerged under warm bath water.</li>
      <li>but it works great; so, for me it was worth the money.</li>
      <li>First let me say, skin should be oil free for the best effect,</li>
      <li>It appears to be eyeliner and mascara repurposed into a new product which is a brilliant marketing strategy however the color is quite a bit darker than advertised therefore its challenging to control the application.</li>
      <li>ok  </li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t love that you need a &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; soap to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The more you do it the quicker the process becomes</li>
      <li>This product is better than any powder or pencil</li>
      <li>Fabulous!  </li>
      <li>Works better than the eye brow pencil.</li>
      <li>A keeper, for sure.</li>
      <li>but I do love it and it does stay</li>
      <li>Would love to see some more variety of applicators, etc.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>excellent, my third time ordering</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>but this kit looked interesting.</li>
      <li>I love it, try it.</li>
      <li>SmartBrow eyebrow filler covers the gray and gives me beautiful, natural looking eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>Overall, very good product.</li>
      <li>Believe it or not, I found it easier to take waterproof mascara in the shade you use for your eyelashes and lightly brush it on your eyebrows until you get the desired affect (you can use the tip of the brush for more definition).  </li>
      <li>It washes off easily.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to master.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, but easier to overdo it.</li>
      <li>But, really, it&#x27;s such a great product that I can overlook those downsides.</li>
      <li>My advice is to keep a light hand while using it</li>
      <li>Finally, I had to soften the color by adding some of my mineral powder and the end product looks great.</li>
      <li>Really useful!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I did not need the  special remover</li>
      <li>Believe me, this SmartBrow is ONLY for those who have a fair amount of brow hair for the fibers in the product to adhere to them.  </li>
      <li>but as I really need this more for drawing and not for filling-</li>
      <li>However beware, if your eyebrows are very sparse and you have more skin in the area than brow hair, this stuff will give you painted-on look.  </li>
      <li>Go light with your application at first then add as needed.</li>
      <li>Hey, some of us love to experiment with new beauty aids</li>
      <li>Easy to use,wish fibres were more obvious so more hairy and wish it included stencils to get a great shape as it&#x27;s hard to get precision for shape unless you still pencil draw first</li>
      <li>I used this along with pencil to make them look more natural.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it, there are plenty of tutorials on line.</li>
      <li>Really useful product, which I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
      <li>I used the mascara on looked much more natural.</li>
      <li>My eyebrows grow unfortunately low and are oddly shaped so I struggled through trying a variety of products until I found the perfect tool to shape and create brows as I have to wax most of my natural brow away.</li>
      <li>It comes in handy especially while doing hot yoga, 108 * heat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that having fuller eyebrows makes your face look younger and your eyes stand out more.</li>
      <li>Now that&#x27;s smart!</li>
      <li>This came highly recommended by a friend whom typically refers great products  - however It did not meet my expectations.</li>
      <li>However I used a normal brow brush after to soften the lines.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product that lives up to the advertised claims, but I think it is very overpriced and will not be getting a second order.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I&#x27;m truly impressed</li>
      <li>First off, the black/brown color isn&#x27;t great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I figured when I ran out of the formula on the brush side reservoir I&#x27;d be able to switch the applicators around, but the way the threads are designed you cannot properly get the brush into the spoolie reservoir.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says.  </li>
      <li>Definitely apply the initial filler with a LIGHT hand, and you will love this product.</li>
      <li>I was really worried about the color when I first looked at the product.  </li>
      <li>My brows only needed a little filling in, it works beautifully.</li>
      <li>hopefully the next one should be better easy and not so dry</li>
      <li>It made my eyebrows dark and full, product was easy to use, and does what it claims to do.</li>
      <li>I really like the smart brow.</li>
      <li>it absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product really does work.</li>
      <li>Very unnatural.  </li>
      <li>The videos make it look easier than it really is.</li>
      <li>Thanks again</li>
      <li>This product lasts me months because you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>It really works well.</li>
      <li>This really works well.  </li>
      <li>I have very sparse brows</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been good at eyebrows and it only took me a couple of tries.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this directly from SmartBrow (not Amazon), and tossed it after I FINALLY realized that you actually need brow hair - and a fair amount.  </li>
      <li>They could reduce the price by not including a &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; when your own ordinary facial cleanser will work just fine to remove the eyebrow color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brush is small enough for a super precise application, although the I would prefer not to have the spooly side , just one tube and one the one fine brush applicator.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s how it works: first you use what looks like a very fine tiny brush, like an eyeliner brush, to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; the bare and sparse spots in your eyebrow line (I don&#x27;t have bare spots but remember, this was an experiment).</li>
      <li>If you really are nearly browless, stay away from SmartBrow, unless you want to look like Eddie Munster!  </li>
      <li>I have tried several pencils and other products to have nice looking eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Kind of hard to make your eyebrows look realistic.</li>
      <li>It looks MUCH more natural than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Sets very well and looks natural.</li>
      <li>I discovered this stuff a few years ago by accident and have been in love with it every since.  </li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews on this product.</li>
      <li>, it came off with my normal MakeUp remover wipes (MAC) .  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love that this product stays on for days sometimes, but find it really hard to put it on without stray marks. I also don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t really get a thick line for brows.</li>
    <li> I had to practice a few times but finally got the hang of it. I&#x27;m Asian and chose black/brown. I actually just ordered another so I wouldn&#x27;t run out. My brows looked natural.</li>
    <li> This product is Amazing!!! It works and blends in perfectly. 👍👍</li>
    <li> WISH IT WERE EASIER TO APPLY AND NOT BE SO DARK</li>
    <li> excellent, my third time ordering</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this product.I have very sparse brows and this stays all day even in the shower.It takes a little practice to get it how you want your brows to look.,but will look natural.</li>
    <li> TOO, TOO dark for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Sets very well and looks natural.</li>
    <li> Was extremely disappointed ... can I return it/</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, I found it easier to take waterproof mascara in the shade you use for your eyelashes and lightly brush it on your eyebrows until you get the desired affect (you can use the tip of the brush for more definition).  I did this on one eyebrow, and applied this product on the other.  The eyebrow I used the mascara on looked much more natural.</li>
    <li> Works better than the eye brow pencil.</li>
    <li> I was really worried about the color when I first looked at the product.  It looked very brown while my brows are black.  However it did turn darker as it dried so it was not as obvious as I worried it would be.  Product did stay in place all day as promised.  I did not need the  special remover, it came off with my normal MakeUp remover wipes (MAC) .  I did like the Liner and mascara type brush options. However I used a normal brow brush after to soften the lines.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product that lives up to the advertised claims, but I think it is very overpriced and will not be getting a second order.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works just as expected. My advice is to keep a light hand while using it</li>
    <li> I use the brush cause I only want a little on  I like it</li>
    <li> This product really does work. I have basically no eyebrows due to overplucking. The only reason I gave it a 4 not a 5 was it takes some time to get use to putting on.  The videos make it look easier than it really is.</li>
    <li> your product has made such a difference for me  I am very pleased will order soon thank you again Theresa</li>
    <li> I have tried several pencils and other products to have nice looking eyebrows. I don&#x27;t remember where I saw this product advertised, but wherever I decided to try it out. First let me say, skin should be oil free for the best effect, next take your time - you will master the application after a few tries. Go light with your application at first then add as needed. Finally, I had to soften the color by adding some of my mineral powder and the end product looks great. You can also define the line using concealer but I used the mineral powder for this step also. I agree it is rather pricey but it works great; so, for me it was worth the money. Check out some videos online. Thank you for reading my review!</li>
    <li> I really like the smart brow. It is a really good filler</li>
    <li> You may as well use your mascara and save your money - I don&#x27;t see any difference using this $50 product.</li>
    <li> I discovered this stuff a few years ago by accident and have been in love with it every since.  It does not smudge or smear and you can wear it all day.  It washes off easily.</li>
    <li> Really useful product, which I didn&#x27;t expect. Hey, some of us love to experiment with new beauty aids and I confess, I&#x27;m one of them. I don&#x27;t have thin eyebrows but this kit looked interesting. The one teeny complaint is the product isn&#x27;t waterproof, so the cleanser they provide (for removing the product) is really not necessary. They could reduce the price by not including a &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; when your own ordinary facial cleanser will work just fine to remove the eyebrow color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how it works: first you use what looks like a very fine tiny brush, like an eyeliner brush, to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; the bare and sparse spots in your eyebrow line (I don&#x27;t have bare spots but remember, this was an experiment). Then you open the other end of the tube and lo and behold, it&#x27;s a brush that looks like a mascara brush, with the same black-brown product to use. Then you use the mascara-like brush to finish the job on your eyebrows. I was very skeptical about this whole process but it ended up really nice! It made my eyebrows dark and full, product was easy to use, and does what it claims to do. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy this again because the cleanser adds to the cost, but if you have thin eyebrows or gaps in them, this is definitely worth a try. I was impressed and I hope you are as well.</li>
    <li> It really works well. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and stays on until you wash it off. This product is better than any powder or pencil I have ever used. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Everyone thinks I got my brows waxed. It takes some getting use to, as the color darkens when applied. A little to dark for my liking, so I will try the lighter version next. I find it very forgiving, so long as you don&#x27;t allow it to set, while you make adjustments. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> If you have eyebrows to begin with, this stuff might be alright to darken and enhance.  However beware, if your eyebrows are very sparse and you have more skin in the area than brow hair, this stuff will give you painted-on look.  Very unnatural.  The product needs to adhere to the hair that make up your brows.  Clearly, if you have very little brow hair, there is no way the product is going to adhere well, and will make it look as though you painted on eyebrows.  If you have sparse brows to begin with, stick with powder (use the kind where you get a dual compact of powder and wax, as this makes the powder easier to control and apply).  Use the former over say, pencil, or just soften pencil with a brow brush after you apply.  Believe me, this SmartBrow is ONLY for those who have a fair amount of brow hair for the fibers in the product to adhere to them.  If you really are nearly browless, stay away from SmartBrow, unless you want to look like Eddie Munster!  I ordered this directly from SmartBrow (not Amazon), and tossed it after I FINALLY realized that you actually need brow hair - and a fair amount.  Of course if you have brow hair already, this will probably enhance what you have, but if it has nothing to adhere to (or very little hair), then forget it!</li>
    <li> This really works well.  It looks MUCH more natural than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Did not live up to the hipe.  Wore off during yard work.  Washed off with Eucerin Redness Relief Cleanser, so I did not have to use the special cleanser - so that was wasted money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effort and patience required to learn and to apply this product are not worth it.  It did not last three days and did not stand up to sweat and toweling during yard work.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, THICK GLOPPY MESS. SO NOT WORTH THE MONEY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff.</li>
    <li> too dark and my brows are very dark to begin with.</li>
    <li> It is amazing. I look different and younger, it brighten my face and it looks natural. I love it, try it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Does exactly what it says.  I don&#x27;t have thin or sparse eyebrows, just a lot of gray.  SmartBrow eyebrow filler covers the gray and gives me beautiful, natural looking eyebrows.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Kind of hard to make your eyebrows look realistic. I used this along with pencil to make them look more natural. It does stay put all day and when getting wet. Overall, very good product.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. I had been wanting to try this product for over a year. First off, the black/brown color isn&#x27;t great.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this gives a natural look and not easy to use. I also don&#x27;t love that you need a &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; soap to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with my Anastasia pencil.</li>
    <li> This product  does not do what you claim Its alos sloppy</li>
    <li> Fabulous!  Really useful!</li>
    <li> This came highly recommended by a friend whom typically refers great products  - however It did not meet my expectations. It appears to be eyeliner and mascara repurposed into a new product which is a brilliant marketing strategy however the color is quite a bit darker than advertised therefore its challenging to control the application. If you decide to give it a try perhaps you might receive a satisfactory result if you order a few shades lighter than the color you wish to achieve ,</li>
    <li> Very difficult to apply</li>
    <li> Stays on all day - looks natural!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s true that having fuller eyebrows makes your face look younger and your eyes stand out more. I have naturally thin eyebrows and even when I stopped plucking and went all natural, they did not fill in well. I use this product sparingly - a little goes a long way! I&#x27;m still new to using the product but found I tend to over-apply and use a Q-tip to take some of the product off so it&#x27;s a less severe look. It stays on for days - throughout face washing, showers and the gym - and doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge. I love this product and recommended it to my friends!</li>
    <li> i will purchase again</li>
    <li> I love this product! My eyebrows grow unfortunately low and are oddly shaped so I struggled through trying a variety of products until I found the perfect tool to shape and create brows as I have to wax most of my natural brow away. It stays on MUCH longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and looks very natural even on bare skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really only use the brush side, and it was much too long to be useful and accurate, but after cutting it down it works like a charm. A felt tip applicator would make it absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of the spoolie on the other end but as I really need this more for drawing and not for filling- it goes untouched. I figured when I ran out of the formula on the brush side reservoir I&#x27;d be able to switch the applicators around, but the way the threads are designed you cannot properly get the brush into the spoolie reservoir. A big bummer. But, really, it&#x27;s such a great product that I can overlook those downsides. I can&#x27;t foresee myself ever going a day without it. Would love to see some more variety of applicators, etc.</li>
    <li> It was way  too dark but it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It&#x27;s OK&amp;#34;, says the wife. The difficulty is just in the outlining if there is either no or little eyebrow hair.  She did relate that it was easier than what she had been doing.</li>
    <li> The one they sent me was so hard to open on the brush side I believed it was more than ten twenty times attempts couldn&#x27;t opened the damn thing I was so frustrated shouldn&#x27;t be that hard so I waited until my husband got home so he can tried he had to get a plier from his tool box to open it so when finally did I tried it and I loved it since then. But it is dried maybe that&#x27;s why it was so stuck I was ready to send it back ..hopefully the next one should be better easy and not so dry ok  but I loved it!..expensive on amazon but on derma store is a lot cheaper though...</li>
    <li> One of my favorite purchases this YEAR!!  Truly looks like you really have brows even when they are super thin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s truly smart!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a product like this for over 10 years! Thank you Smartbrow!&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows are thin and sparse and I&#x27;m extremely active and sweat profusely almost everyday. This product does not run smudge and stays in place even while submerged under warm bath water. It will come off without a problem if I use regular face soap and scrubbing. It comes in handy especially while doing hot yoga, 108 * heat. Now that&#x27;s smart! The only drawback would be that it takes a little getting used to the intensity of the color and going ever gentle with the brush. I haven&#x27;t even attempted to use the brush side, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people who have extremely sparse eyebrows. It&#x27;s too much unless u already have heavy heavy brows, which wouldn&#x27;t need to use this product in the first place. That is the only reason I have not given it a5 star rating. Also, it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I&#x27;m truly impressed so I&#x27;ll keep buying it. I think I have used just about every product imaginable that promised to do the same but hasn&#x27;t even come close to this product. Thanks again</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! You get natural eyebrows, stays on all day, and it fills in all bald spots. With that being said the first time you get this it is not easy to use. Correction... It&#x27;s easy to use, but easier to overdo it. You start little and build your way up. You can&#x27;t go at it like splattering paint on a canvas and expect to get a DaVinci masterpiece. The more you do it the quicker the process becomes and it&#x27;s easy to master. I&#x27;ve never been good at eyebrows and it only took me a couple of tries.  Tip side use for bald spots, brush side to even brow out. For a long time I never used the brush. This product lasts me months because you don&#x27;t need that much. I honestly don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews on this product.</li>
    <li> Way too dark and unnatural looking.</li>
    <li> the brush is not good at all. it carries too much filler and is very difficult to get an even application.</li>
    <li> Love it!  My brows only needed a little filling in, it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now and I love it.  It does not last for days like it claims, you have to sleep and who doesn&#x27;t wash their make up off, but it does last, through heat and humidity and work-out sweat like a champ!  It does take some practice to master but it&#x27;s worth it, there are plenty of tutorials on line. The brush is small enough for a super precise application, although the I would prefer not to have the spooly side , just one tube and one the one fine brush applicator. A keeper, for sure.</li>
    <li> This shld be called &amp;#34;blackest black&amp;#34;. It is super dark. I tried to return after trying it on one eyebrow &amp; was told no. No other options we&#x27;re given. Disappointed :(</li>
    <li> Easy to use,wish fibres were more obvious so more hairy and wish it included stencils to get a great shape as it&#x27;s hard to get precision for shape unless you still pencil draw first but I do love it and it does stay and I mean STAY!!!</li>
    <li> The door was too light for dark eyebrows</li>
    <li> Awesome. Definitely apply the initial filler with a LIGHT hand, and you will love this product. Dab brush on tissue so not so harsh.  The only thing I would wish was that the finishing mascara-type wand was smaller, half the length.  I end up getting some on my skin around my brow after, which is annoying after I have the initial filler on perfect. T</li>
    <li> Requires patience and practice to apply, but an excellent product.</li>
