    <li> These tote bags are a perfect size and will go perfect with my daughters birthday party theme. We love them.</li>
    <li> Small but cute. I plan to hand them out to the great nieces at Family Reunion. I think they&#x27;ll love them.</li>
    <li> These were for a destination wedding. I gave them to the bridal party and they were a hit! Filled them with tons of &amp;#34;get away&amp;#34; goodies. The bags are little but cute for &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; items! Loved them.</li>
    <li> I bought these canvas bags as little gift bags.  I run a nonprofit and we put together little bags for new moms.  They are very cute and sturdy but much smaller than I had imagined.  I believe they have the dimensions on the web, but they don&#x27;t hold very much.  Maybe a small gift - like one large lotion and 1 soap perhaps to give you an idea.  They are perfect for very small gifts and that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll use them.  But I do wish they came in a larger size.  They arrived timely and colors are very bright and cheerful.</li>
    <li> Great bags for our pool party treat bags.  A nice size that fit the &amp;#34;Beach Toy Assortment&amp;#34; we also bought on Amazon.  Bags are cute and something kids can re-use later on for their sunglasses, snacks etc for the car or a trip to the park.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected</li>
    <li> From the description, I thought this bag would be bigger.  I was still able to use but had to improvise...</li>
    <li> great product - perfect for birthday giveaways . Just as I expected.</li>
    <li> They are smaller than expected</li>
    <li> We bought these items for an 11th birthday party with 12 guests. That being said, we were EXTREMELY disappointed when we got the bags and realized that there were only 11 instead of the 12 bags that were promised in the description. The only thing we can do now is hope that one person doesn&#x27;t show up considering we only have enough bags for 11 guests.</li>
    <li> The were very nice and perfect size for party gift bags.  Good Quality material and nicely printed.  kids loved them</li>
    <li> So cute, perfect size for party favors. I did a whole beach theme with mini beach balls. Everyone loved it.</li>
    <li> My customers live their free little girl tote</li>
    <li> Very cute. Didn&#x27;t realize how small they were though.  It will not work for what I bought them for, but I improvised.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a small goody bag. Price is right. Holds sunglasses, deflated beach ball, and small squirt gun with room to spare.</li>
    <li> Adorable bags, using as a gift bag for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party this weekend!</li>
    <li> Once/year my family travels together internationally.  I used these as gift bags and stuffed them with sunscreen, chocolates and airplane liquor bottles!  They were a huge hit!  Many reused them throughout the week as beach bags.  They were bigger than I expected and a GREAT buy for the money!!!!  I&#x27;m thinking about buying them again for next year and just stuffing them with different items.</li>
    <li> Came on time...cute for goodie bag for children&#x27;s summer theme parties!</li>
    <li> Used these as the goodie bags after a Hawaiian Luau party.  The kids loved them.</li>
    <li> They are cute, but small. I bought them to thank my clients, since I am a travel agent.  Wanted to put some essentials in them,  a floppy hat isn&#x27;t going to fit. So I am putting smaller travel stuff in them. I was hoping they were bigger, so clients could take them to the pool, with essentials without it being so small, they might forget them. Guess they will have to work.</li>
    <li> Very cute bags!!  I used them for my 8 year old daughters goody bags.</li>
    <li> Used these as summer birthday party bags. They worked great and held multiple party items without a problem. A little pricey but they are material and hopefully the party goers can find a use for them rather than tossing them like they would paper bags.</li>
    <li> I bought these as gift bags for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party.  They were the perfect size and are super cute.</li>
    <li> These were brilliant as eco-friendly gift bags for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party.</li>
    <li> These bags were great for our welcome bags to our destination party in Mexico. The colors and quality were much nicer in person than pictured.  Great deal!!</li>
    <li> Kids loved this gift bag at our grandson&#x27;s 6th birthday swim party.</li>
    <li> Cute but very small.... size of your palm</li>
    <li> Good quality but very small!! Not a good value for money! There was another option for almost the same price but double the size! Wish I bought that! At least that would have been useable!</li>
    <li> Super cute party favor bags</li>
    <li> Kids loved it as party favors</li>
    <li> Nice tote that was able to fit a reasonable amount of part favors. Great for a beach or pool party theme.</li>
    <li> Just what I was look in for</li>
    <li> I had to return these as they were way too small. But nice bags if you need a very small size.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2A81QCMPTQ0DU]]These are about the height of an iPad and fit everything I got for favors for our daughter two year old pool party, snack bag, kettle corn cone, sunglasses, deflated 6\\&quot;beach ball a little runner Ducky and some candy ...

    <li> Great little bags the fit the right amount of party favors in them for birthdays and such.. I fit a deflated beach ball a toy car 1 pair of sun glasses a small squirt gun and mini hand rockets and some stickers in them worked out perfect However they shorted me 1 bag. I didn&#x27;t have the time to wait for them to ship me 1 bag so I did with out. I never complained to them so I don&#x27;t know how they would have handled fixing it for me but over all great little bags!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a piano teacher and I bought these for a summer party as gift bags for my students. They arrived quickly, the colors were beautiful, and they were big enough for my use. I wanted something small to hold little gifts, and they were perfect. If you&#x27;re looking for a beach bag, however, this is not the bag for you.</li>
    <li> Very cute for the price, used as party bags for 3rd grade Hawaiian themed party. Small but worked great!</li>
    <li> great sturdy material and cute !</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> A bit smaller than I originally thought they&#x27;d be, but it worked out great.</li>
    <li> They are great for the price.  I bought to use as party favor bags and they have lasted for a few months since.</li>
    <li> small but very nice little bags used for party favors.</li>
    <li> They were cute but to small</li>
    <li> These are not huge bags but they are the perfect size to hold a t-shirt, some candy and other trinkets. The quality is really good for the low price. We also took them and added names in glitter to personalize each bag.</li>
    <li> These bags are amazing! Could they be a tad bit bigger? Sure.  But it worked just fine! Used for my 3 year old favor bags. The bags included: deflated beach ball, sunglasses, water soaker/pump, fubbles, beach stickers, and a large beach ball cookie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bags were amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and find!</li>
    <li> I was not careful enough about checking the size of these bags when I ordered and they are mini&#x27;s not exactly what I wanted, but I can make do</li>
    <li> You cannot even fit a flip flop in the so called bag, let alone a towel, I was very disappointed, I should&#x27;ve looked for more information on this product, I&#x27;ve tried to contact amazon with not too much luck. I want to return these, I have no use for them.</li>
    <li> These are darling and were a big hit and my granddaughters birthday party.</li>
    <li> gifts they were a big hit</li>
    <li> much smaller than it looks, can&#x27;t fit anything in it....</li>
    <li> These cute little bags worked great as goodie bags for my daughters birthday party. They are small and low quality, but they fit all the trinkets I wanted to put in them (child sized plastic gym water bottle, bubbles, deflated mini beach balls, plastic glow necklaces, punching balloons, Olympic medals, lip balm, stickers) and they are a lot more durable/functional than a basic plastic bag that just ends up in the trash. My daughter and her friends are still using them to carry around small toys/items. The three different patterns and handle colors worked well too. The blue handled bags were suitable for boys - they weren&#x27;t too girly. The stitching inside the bags was a mess but I just trimmed off some of the excess thread which made them more presentable. I bought two sets of these bags (24 in total) and none of them were ripped at the seam or came apart when I stuffed them chock full of &amp;#34;stuff.&amp;#34;  Only one bag had a handle that was too frayed to give out at the party but my daughter uses it around the house just fine! These bags served their intended purpose well - a great value as goodie bags for a child&#x27;s birthday!</li>
    <li> Cute but really, really small. Might be able to get 2 cans of corn in it.</li>
    <li> Adorable to use as goody bags for a kids birthday party!</li>
    <li> IT WAS REALLY CUTE. NICE TO USE FOR GOODY BAG LOL</li>
