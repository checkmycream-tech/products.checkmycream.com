      <li>and it has done me good so far!</li>

      <li>Thanks for the product!</li>
      <li>Pleasently surprised with how comfortable and well this glue held.</li>

      <li>Works really well for me</li>
      <li>I really didnt like it&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
      <li>I really like Ardell.</li>
      <li>Anyway, this works really well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad Ardell made DARK lash adhesive</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>I love that it is black</li>
      <li>No drugstore or cosmetic department could keep stock of this particular eyelash glue</li>
      <li>Good, dries grey, last long, easy to work with, need to put extra in the inner corners of the eyelashes.</li>
      <li>This glue was SO much better: it was so easy to apply that I may start using false lashes in my regular makeup routine.</li>
      <li>Love that stuff, no more fussing with falsies.</li>
      <li>and I look and feel quite pretty actually.</li>
      <li>I recommend getting the clear instead, however, since I didn&#x27;t think about that</li>
      <li>clear gloss my lips</li>
      <li>but it came as a clear which I didn&#x27;t want</li>
      <li>Not messy</li>
      <li>My only problem is the smell straight from the tube, but it doesn&#x27;t smell when it dries, so its alright.</li>
      <li>Of directly applying.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more of a dark gray than a black.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more of a dark gray than  black.</li>
      <li>Be sure to only put a VERY small amount of adhesive on the lash line, or else the lashes will not stick at all.</li>
      <li>Though this is difficult to use at first, once you get the hang of what you&#x27;re doing you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>Be careful, because it is very runny</li>
      <li>Usually I just use a wet q-tip and my false eyelashes fall off easily, and finish off with a cleanser :)</li>

<li> It&#x27;s just the right consistency, not too runny or too thick.  </li>
<li> it glued well i just wish i had gotten the clear one instead of the dark.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s not only invincible, my eyelashes stay on all day long.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t come dry, last fairly long.</li>
<li> Stays long and does the job.</li>
<li> It takes a long time to dry to the tacky state you want to apply your lashes.  </li>
<li> only use this if you use black eyeliner.  </li>
<li> dries black no white rresidue</li>
<li> I have absolutely no complaints about it.</li>
<li> Works well with cheap lashes or expensive ones!</li>
<li> PERFECTION, if you are new to using false eyelashes</li>
<li> Only complaint would be the consistency.</li>
<li> Also, the glue ruins the eyelashes, making them so you they can not be reused.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t get the one I wanted I ordered the dark one</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t always wear dark eye makeup.</li>
<li> ruins the eyelashes so if you have reusable ones don&#x27;t get this</li>
<li> The dark adhesive looks like dark eyeliner between the lashes.</li>
<li> it may take some time to adjusted to the dark adhesive.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t always need to add extra eyeliner when I&#x27;m finished applying the false lashes because it dries dark and not clear.  </li>
<li> I bought the black one</li>
<li> but it wasn&#x27;t really black</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this eyelash glue is the best one I have used so far the color is great and it really holds, I slept in my lashes and they were still on perfectly the next morning.</li>
    <li> Great packaging , very fast delivery!!!! A really great glue- u can actually get it in your eye and doesn&#x27;t sting- not so with others!!!</li>
    <li> Tried this with fake lashes. Gave up and purchased Younique 3d fiber mascara. Love that stuff, no more fussing with falsies.</li>
    <li> Im very happy with this product! It keeps lashes on, very easy to apply. Lashes did not fly off even when i was riding a motorbike!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this glue for fake eye lashes.</li>
    <li> They keep my lashes on extremely well!! Even in the winds of the Colorado winter. I have absolutely no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> I got it as a gift. I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints but this brand is pretty good and I haven&#x27;t head any complaints yet</li>
    <li> It is exactly what is shown it works great!</li>
    <li> This is the most brilliant idea ever. The dark adhesive looks like dark eyeliner between the lashes. I really like Ardell. Several weeks ago I had never even heard of the company. But I bought this along with the applicator (another brilliant invention) and Ardell&#x27;s multipack demi wispies and I am loving it. I&#x27;m allergic to latex and neither these nor the lashes have given me any problems whatsoever. I&#x27;ll throw my lashes on, dash some blush on my cheeks, clear gloss my lips and I look and feel quite pretty actually.</li>
    <li> IT WAS OK. NASTY SMELL!</li>
    <li> Great. Stays long and does the job.</li>
    <li> just as good as clear.  only use this if you use black eyeliner.  It avoids having to put the eyeliner over the glue.</li>
    <li> I bought this on Feb 10, 2012 (Yeah, I know... I forgot to leave a product review back then) from Luxxe Beauty since their international shipping fee was affordable.  Anyway, this works really well and I still have it! You only need a tiny amount to use it. Moreover, it washes off easily too. Usually I just use a wet q-tip and my false eyelashes fall off easily, and finish off with a cleanser :)</li>
    <li> they were a bit longer than I expected but they still look great and they came super early</li>
    <li> Though this is difficult to use at first, once you get the hang of what you&#x27;re doing you&#x27;ll be fine. I recommend getting the clear instead, however, since I didn&#x27;t think about that and I don&#x27;t always wear dark eye makeup. Lesson learned!</li>
    <li> Good glue! Works well with cheap lashes or expensive ones! I love that it is black and it has done me good so far! I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Glue didn&#x27;t get tacky</li>
    <li> Very strong and sturdy. Overrall probably the best lash glue out there. My only problem is the smell straight from the tube, but it doesn&#x27;t smell when it dries, so its alright.</li>
    <li> Awesome product with that price... Better than getting it at any drug store! Love it and stay long... Seller also quick in sending the product!</li>

    <li> My lashes keep falling off.</li>
    <li> PERFECTION, if you are new to using false eyelashes it may take some time to adjusted to the dark adhesive. I am getting to use to and I will be using this from now on. GREAT PURCHASE!</li>
    <li> I bought the black one but it wasn&#x27;t really black it was great but good tho</li>
    <li> I bought this for Halloween to use with false lashes that came with not-so-great glue. This glue was SO much better: it was so easy to apply that I may start using false lashes in my regular makeup routine.</li>
    <li> I really didnt like it&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt stick as well its to messy!&lt;br /&gt;i had to throw away my lashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer DUO</li>
    <li> This adhesive is amazing.  I don&#x27;t always need to add extra eyeliner when I&#x27;m finished applying the false lashes because it dries dark and not clear.  My customers love how strongly it holds the lashes on, too!</li>
    <li> I would buy again it did really good stays on easy to take off for a beginner this was the best pproduct</li>
    <li> Really good product. Dries out quickly, not too messy and it remains black</li>
    <li> I bought it for someone else</li>
    <li> Works! Slightly hard to get off!</li>
    <li> Works great. Not messy</li>
    <li> it does what it should!</li>
    <li> Not good. Cannot even stick my eyelash on.  Easy to fell</li>
    <li> Its ok..doesn&#x27;t hold well for me</li>
    <li> FAKE HAIR IS GLUED TO MY FACE SO WELL!</li>
    <li> Works really well for me</li>
    <li> I am just learning how to put false lashes on.  I bought this because the reviews said it would be good for a beginner.  Well, I must be whatever comes before beginner because it is difficult to use.  Coming out of the tube it is runny and gloopy.  It takes a long time to dry to the tacky state you want to apply your lashes.  It&#x27;s gray.  I am going to look for something else.</li>
    <li> With these things, they either work or they dont.  This one does.  It&#x27;s just the right consistency, not too runny or too thick.  Just be sure to clean off the tip when you&#x27;re done to prevent it from clogging up on you.</li>
    <li> Worked well to attach false lashes</li>
    <li> The glue never gets tacky(I wait like 1 minute) and it slides around on my eyelid. Doesn&#x27;t compare to duo</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the one I wanted I ordered the dark one but it came as a clear which I didn&#x27;t want but i guess it could work too</li>
    <li> For some reason, I thought it would blend with my fake eyelashes better but it&#x27;s more of a dark gray than a black. It still does the same job and a great job at that, but I think I&#x27;d prefer the white glue.</li>
    <li> It was okay i assume. it glued well i just wish i had gotten the clear one instead of the dark.</li>
    <li> 5 stars! Works great 😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad Ardell made DARK lash adhesive, it&#x27;s not only invincible, my eyelashes stay on all day long. Also, very easy to remove. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I ordered the dark eyelash glue and it came in perfect condition, deliverd as promised, and I would most definitely come back and purchase again. No drugstore or cosmetic department could keep stock of this particular eyelash glue I use so I am extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> stays on. there is a difference between lash GRIP and lash TITE.  they both work fine for me depending if i want to take them off at the end ofthe day. dries black no white rresidue</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and can&#x27;t live without it! Love it</li>
    <li> Good, dries grey, last long, easy to work with, need to put extra in the inner corners of the eyelashes. Didn&#x27;t come dry, last fairly long. Good product, just don&#x27;t like the grey.</li>
    <li> First experience with this brand and a tinted glue. Pleasently surprised with how comfortable and well this glue held. It was more a dark gray than brown, but it looked really good. Only complaint would be the consistency. Be careful, because it is very runny and you my get a big glob on your lashes without even squeezing the tube. I ended up painting it on instead. Of directly applying. Did not irritate my eyes or contacts at all, evenafter wearing 6 hours. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> ruins the eyelashes so if you have reusable ones don&#x27;t get this</li>
    <li> great product and fast</li>
    <li> Perfect and simple! Thanks for the product!</li>
    <li> It does not require allot of glue and it stays all day and then some. Very happy with product!</li>
    <li> Right consistency. Not too runny or too thick. I thought it would blend perfectly with fake eyelashes but it&#x27;s more of a dark gray than  black. It does the job though!</li>
    <li> This glue dries black and makes look like you have on black eyeliner!! Great hold and easy to apply!! Would definitely recommend!!</li>
