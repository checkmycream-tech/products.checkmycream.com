    <li> These are very good for cleaning in between teeth.  They work better and are easier to use than dental picks or toothpicks.  You can bring them with you anywhere to use right after you eat. The only problem I have with them is that the handle is way too flexible.  I have used other brands that have a more rigid handle so it is easier and quicker to use.</li>
    <li> These are great for that extra teeth cleaning that we all need.  I like these brushes and got them here because they have subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> VERY SATISFIED ........... EXCELLENT VERY GOOD QUALITY GOOD OPTION FOR THE PRICE AND RECOMMEND ... MUYBUEN BUY QUALITY, EXCELLENT DURADERO</li>
    <li> These are great for cleaning between the teeth that is more convenient (although my dentist tells me not a substitute for) flossing.</li>
    <li> This product is great for keeping in-between your teeth clean and avoid plaque build up. My teeth have a lot of space in-between and there was always a build up especially between my bottom teeth, BUT NO MORE. Love it</li>

    <li> These brushes fit perfectly in all of my daughter&#x27;s orthodontia appliances. Last for several days. Easy to pack in a purse or school bag.</li>
    <li> I liked this product the brushes however were a little too flexible.. But I was so pleased to find this product on Amazon, It serves my purpose, I have been unable to located these brushes in stores.</li>
    <li> It is as the picture shows. I do not have other things to say anymore. Again, no more to say to fill up the required number of words.</li>
    <li> So Much easier to use and re-use, than Dental Floss,  Keep in pocket or purse for appropriate use most anywhere.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my kid in braces needed.</li>
    <li> Better than floss and much less messy.  Grab a pack for your car, briefcase and you desk.  You definitely won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> These are a great invention, works well for braces to get the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; the big toothbrush misses.</li>
    <li> These are pretty weak. If it had been a 50-pack at this price, I&#x27;d give them five stars...but it&#x27;s a 10-pack. Not a good value and there are many better versions on the market for less.</li>
    <li> Amazing for removing inter dental food that flossing might not get. My dentist has said that I&#x27;ve been taking excellent care of my teeth, and I give credit to these little helpers...</li>
    <li> These are really good - just wish there were more of them. These are quite useful to carry around in your purse or pocket.</li>
    <li> Great for tight spaces between teeth.  The brush lasts for a few days.  I would buy again for future use.</li>
    <li> I have lingual braces (braces on the backs of my teeth), so cleaning my teeth could be a hassle. This makes it easier for me, and can go through multiple uses — you just need to wash it, of course.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really good, and I trust Plackers.</li>
    <li> You can brush, you can floss, you can vigorously swish, and STILL you will not believe how much is left behind, between your teeth, that this product removes.  I&#x27;m so grateful I found it!</li>
    <li> great product works great with braces</li>
    <li> Shipped quick, as advertised, handy to have in your purse, its a handy little helper, recommened !!!&lt;br /&gt;Used this product daily</li>
    <li> easy to use for cleaning between braces....brushes can be re-used several times if you rinse brush off between uses....you&#x27;d get quite a long time of use out of this package. My son has been using them for 3 months and still has some left.</li>
    <li> These work great!  The center &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; wire is a bit thick for my teeth, but these come in handy at work.</li>
