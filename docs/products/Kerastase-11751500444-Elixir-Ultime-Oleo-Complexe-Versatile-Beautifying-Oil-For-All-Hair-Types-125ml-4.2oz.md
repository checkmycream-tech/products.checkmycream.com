      <li>/&gt;Moroccan oil (regular and light) are far superior to this product, and much more affordable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m older than most but keep up my looks.</li>
      <li>It has a very pleasing scent - not too strong.  </li>
      <li>I viewed several videos on Youtube about amazing hair care.</li>
      <li>well worth the price.</li>
      <li>but it is worth the wait.</li>
      <li>I also sometimes run a teeny bit of oil between my hands to further smooth the top layer of my hair after I am done styling it.</li>
      <li>But honestly, it&#x27;s gathering dust since I only use it on the weekends now.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried dozens of oils, but this is by far my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I have long curly hair and this product makes it look very nice and feel natural.</li>
      <li>I saw a huge difference the first time I used it, and now I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>Tried this one for the first time and it worked with my hair.</li>
      <li>so tonight I used it for the first time.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, it has arrived one day before!</li>
      <li>The golden blonde shines line18k gold and the platinum in smooth and shines as well.</li>
      <li>The ends were dry and when I applied it, my ends got softer and much better.</li>
      <li>Its really does help</li>
      <li>It left my hair so silky and smooth</li>
      <li>smells so good and really does smooth those crazy hairs</li>
      <li>I love this oil for holding down flyaway hair pieces.  </li>
      <li>This is the first hair oil that hasn&#x27;t weighed down my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was better than nothing - but for the price I felt I should&#x27;ve had much better results.</li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long way, it smells great, and my hair feels really soft.</li>
      <li>I focus more on my ends because they&#x27;re very dry, and I also use it after my hair is blown out, to smooth it down.  </li>
      <li>I have straight hair naturally.</li>
      <li>My hair is color treated from brown/gray to golden blonde.</li>
      <li>This last&#x27;s a long time, and I love the way my hair feels.</li>
      <li>If you can get it at a price that you can live with, try it out.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you apply it after and not before flat ironing if you are using it on dry hair.</li>
      <li>They certainly seem to be the most expensive though and the jury is still out for me on if they are worth the price.</li>
      <li>Having fallen in love with Keratsase, I purchased this instead of my usual Moroccan oil.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair soft!</li>
      <li>I used it last night for the first time.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Worth the price and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>really adds back the shine.  </li>
      <li>and my hands are just as soft.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the high price.</li>
      <li>Hair was smooth and less dry.</li>
      <li>This fine little bottle can cure any dry, unshiny hair.</li>
      <li>Hair that is already dry plus oil plus high heat equals deep-fried hair.</li>
      <li>As soon as a bottle is empty, I buy a new one.</li>
      <li>Although a little pricey, it&#x27;s worth every single penny.</li>

    <li> Product is amazing! Have been using it for about 2 years. Makes my hair so smooth &amp; manageable. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This last&#x27;s a long time, and I love the way my hair feels. This is one of the many products I use from Kerastase.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this product herself.  She recommended it for me, and now I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!  My hair is lustrous and rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do but I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the high price. Hair was smooth and less dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 3 years... my hair looks greats, so soft and smell great!</li>
    <li> Love it but don&#x27;t order from this seller because IT&#x27;LL NEVER COME!</li>
    <li> Great product! This is the first hair oil that hasn&#x27;t weighed down my fine hair. Also reduces frizz and has a nice light smell.</li>
    <li> This is hands down one of the best hair products.  I use it on my hair when it&#x27;s damp- I focus more on my ends because they&#x27;re very dry, and I also use it after my hair is blown out, to smooth it down.  Not only does it make my hair softer it also smells great.  If you buy it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  A little bit goes a long way, it smells great, and my hair feels really soft.</li>
    <li> Fabulous stuff!  It has a very pleasing scent - not too strong.  And just 1 pump of the product, massaged into damp hair - really adds back the shine.  I really love this stuff - I wish it was less expensive!</li>
    <li> smells so good and really does smooth those crazy hairs</li>
    <li> Love Love  Love this stuff! My Salon uses it at the John Charles Salon in uptown and It is AMAZE! Plus, it smells like sugar. Super sweet and yummy smell no overpowering or alcohol or perfume smell. Its light and super absorbant, makes a HUGE difference on my hair. Two pumps is all I need. Hair is not greasy or oily after. Start with One pump and work your way up.</li>
    <li> I had very dry and damaged ends and this hellped smooth them out. Hair has a lot more bounce and it is easy to brush through</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil, that my hairdresser advised me to try! Has a nice smell, hair look silky and shiny. Doesn&#x27;t make hair oily or heavy! I would recommend it to everybody! Shipping was fast, it has arrived one day before! Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil.  I have relaxed hair which gets very dry.  I have tried dozens of oils, but this is by far my favorite.  It is very pricey, but this is the best price I have found.  If you can get it at a price that you can live with, try it out.</li>
    <li> As soon as a bottle is empty, I buy a new one. The bottle lasts 1 year...&lt;br /&gt;I receive so many compliments on how shiny my hair looks</li>
    <li> Still need to give it some time to see if it lives up to my expectations but so far I think it&#x27;s a nice product &amp; it smells incredible!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use Ciment Termique Reconstructor Milk along with this product and my hair never looked better</li>
    <li> will go a long way as you only have to use a little at a time. very light and has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I will never be without this product! Wow! This product is so amazing...so tonight I used it for the first time. It left my hair so silky and smooth and my hands are just as soft. My hair is so damaged due to bleach and several highlight jobs. Although a little pricey, it&#x27;s worth every single penny. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Thus is a wonderful producy that smoothes even the frizziest of hair (mine) and puts a healthy shine on toi. Pricey but it will last a long time.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have tried many products. I use this one every day with no build up or greasy look. I have long curly hair and this product makes it look very nice and feel natural. Worth the price and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Tried this one for the first time and it worked with my hair. The ends were dry and when I applied it, my ends got softer and much better.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! It keeps my hair soft!</li>
    <li> Nothing different from any other oil treatment. hair was still tangled after use even when i use copious amounts</li>
    <li> My hair can get dull and a bit frizzy from coloring and heat styling it, and this oil makes it look so much shinier and healthier. I saw a huge difference the first time I used it, and now I can&#x27;t live without it! I have shoulder length hair, and I distribute one pump through towel dried hair and then comb it through. Usually I then blow dry my hair and flat iron it in places. Sometimes I just dry the front and throw the rest of my hair up. Neither the hair I blow dry nor the hair that air dries ever looks even slightly greasy. I also sometimes run a teeny bit of oil between my hands to further smooth the top layer of my hair after I am done styling it. Just make sure you apply it after and not before flat ironing if you are using it on dry hair. Hair that is already dry plus oil plus high heat equals deep-fried hair. I have tried many, many products (from drugstore to high-end) to keep my hair looking healthy, and this oil is far and away the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really serious about my hair care products. Having fallen in love with Keratsase, I purchased this instead of my usual Moroccan oil. I&#x27;m sad to say that this didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was better than nothing - but for the price I felt I should&#x27;ve had much better results. Because of the ridiculous price tag, I&#x27;m using this bottle up (and sharing with my daughter as well). But honestly, it&#x27;s gathering dust since I only use it on the weekends now.&lt;br /&gt;Moroccan oil (regular and light) are far superior to this product, and much more affordable.</li>
    <li> Amazing , the smell the texture and most important the result on my hair</li>
    <li> I think my wife liked it</li>
    <li> Works miracles! I have straight hair naturally. It for sure helps make it look as if I had used a straightening iron.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for holding down flyaway hair pieces.  It also is great for shine and softness if you have dry hair.  I only have to use a drop or two so even though it is an expensive product it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Fantastic before shampooing (I put it on my ends the night before I shampoo and tie my hair in a braid.) It soaks it up and smells amazing and is super soft. Love!</li>
    <li> I am a hair care fanatic. I want my hair to look it&#x27;s best at all times. I&#x27;m older than most but keep up my looks. My hair is color treated from brown/gray to golden blonde. I recently added some platinum highlights which took a toll on my hair. I viewed several videos on Youtube about amazing hair care. The Kerastase brand came up more than once so I began my search for this product. I used it last night for the first time. I applied a liberal amount and left it on my hair for several hours before shampooing. After towel drying, I pumped small amounts and worked it through the troubled areas. This morning when I woke I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. The golden blonde shines line18k gold and the platinum in smooth and shines as well. I have already added another bottle to my cart because I never want to run out. The price is the best I could find. The seller is a little slow in shipping but it is worth the wait. I am looking forward to trying other Kerastase products. Don&#x27;t hesitate, order it now, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This fine little bottle can cure any dry, unshiny hair. I use it before I brow dry and after I have straightened my hair. Its really does help</li>
    <li> I started using Keratase products about 6 months ago because my hairdresser said they are the best. They certainly seem to be the most expensive though and the jury is still out for me on if they are worth the price.That is, on everything but this Elixir. It is the best hair smoothing product on the market and well worth the price. I&#x27;ve been growing my hair long for about a year and am getting very small trims every three or four months. The ends were getting dry and shabby looking so I tried other less expensive products but they made my hair feel heavy and greasy. I finally broke down and tried this one based on the reviews on Amazon. I am so happy I did because it smooths my hair so well and feels so lightweight, even though I use it sparingly. My hair even stopped growing but this product seemed to jump start the growing process again. Probably because it keeps the ends smooth and well hydrated so it isn&#x27;t breaking off anymore. My hair is longer, smoother, and shinier since starting this product and I will definitely by it again.</li>
    <li> loved, and continue buying chefgou in record time.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product.  Moisturizes and shines without making hair flat and oily looking.  Love it.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive...</li>
    <li> if you thought that moroccian oil was best you are incorrect.  this does not strip color and makes your hair stronger.  On the advise from my stylist I changed, what  a difference</li>
