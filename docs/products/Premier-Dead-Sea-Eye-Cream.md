<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it !! Would recommend it ..</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works for me to keep skin around my eyes from being too oily or dry.</li>
    <li> I have used these products for over a year now and I love the results. I look younger, even my kids could tell the difference! Used together with the full eye care set, you get great results.</li>
    <li> Again, do not waste your money.  I use it for a body cream because it did nothing for my eyes.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is great for the face and neck...it didn&#x27;t do much for the eyes...great for the winter months when your skin dries out</li>
    <li> This is a really good product.  I have problems with eye creams traveling into my eyes, and this one doesn&#x27;t.  It also reduces the puffiness that comes with age, lack of sleep, etc.  Amazon is the place to shop!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I wonder if this is an expired lot or if it just sat in my mailbox in the sun too long? Got to me in a form I can&#x27;t imagine as original. Still, the active ingredients appear to still be active, it definitely moistens under my eyes.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> This eyecream is the best!</li>
    <li> gets rid of puffiness. smooth as silk.</li>
    <li> there is a little problem in transit,A bit leak out.</li>
    <li> I purchased the eye cream for my mother and she is very happy with the product</li>
    <li> GOOD, IT HELPS ME TO GET THE WRINKES OFF</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this one make my skin red. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This works as good as any other eye cream I apply this to the top and bottom of eye. I did noticed it burns my eyes if I rub my eye but it&#x27;s not anything that last I think the benefits out weight the minimal burning of the eyes.</li>
    <li> Great way to erase off the puffiness and fine lines. I use it as a night cream and it has been splendidly  effective!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, attractive large jar, nicely packaged with a couple of samples. Would experiment with other items in the range based on this.&lt;br /&gt;Crows feet seeme to have disappeared surprisingly, still working on the squint lines!</li>
    <li> The puffiness of eyes fades. The eyes look fresh and lifted the whole day. It eliminates fine wrinkles around eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of eye creams and this cream is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.  Hydrates the eye area well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like some creams do.  Price is budget friendly and speedy delivery.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a different</li>
    <li> Great product I have used before and the amazon price is more affordable than the mall kiosk prices. I like that this is also a large quanity for the price. Eye cream can be expensive and its a miniscule amount. Tip: keep the inside seal this product is a water base and can evaporate.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but after a week of use, the skin around my eyes became tight, dry, itchy, and inflamed. At first, I only applied the cream in the morning, then I increased it to night time use, and then, as the aforementioned symptoms became more severe, I applied it whenever my skin was, well, in pain. The more eye cream I applied, the worse it became. Of course, I didn&#x27;t want to believe that, but by the 7th or 8th day of use, I realized I needed to stop.  As soon as I did, my eyes calmed down. My results may not be typical--could have been some sort of allergic reaction, sure. But I still felt it was necessary to post this warning to others.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and have been using it twice a day, everyday for the last 2 months and have seen NO RESULTS.  I also purchased other products from this line and again NO RESULTS!!!!!!!!!!!!  Extremely dissappointed.</li>
    <li> This was something I bought for my mother in law to address the puffiness under eyes. Most of the reviews said it reduced puffiness and it received a pretty good rating. My mother in laws skin was extremely irritated and the puffiness increased immediately upon application. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> GREASY!  Not what i thought I was getting at all.  Is not the same stuff you get at the mall.</li>
    <li> This cream is INCREDIBLE!! I have used other creams in the past and waited and waited for results and none ever came. Finally something that shows results FAST! I received this cream 4 days ago and have been using it day and night since. I can already see a difference in the fine lines under my eyes. I am keeping it in the fridge, since I wake up with puffy eyes, and it seems to help with the puffiness. I also ordered the eye serum from this brand and I am hoping it has the same amazing effects that this cream has had. I will definitely continue to use and will recommend over and over again!</li>
    <li> This dried my eyes out, and I was unable to return it.  I never should have talked to that saleslady, she was really pushing this stuff.  It didn&#x27;t hurt my eyes until the next day, and of course the &amp;#34;personal phone number&amp;#34; she gave me just went straight to voicemail and no one ever called me back.  Note to self: don&#x27;t speak to the evil kiosk people in the mall.  Just pretend you can&#x27;t hear or see them.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use it as a facial moisturizer, which means I go through it much faster than those who use it just for the eye area. Because of that, it ends up being fairly expensive for my budget. This seller is offering it at a great price; I think the other sellers, mostly off of Amazon, are ripping people off. I like how it softens my skin and prepares it for make-up. I haven&#x27;t been able to find a moisturizer that does the same. My skin is sensitive and so I have tried many products in search of one like this.</li>
    <li> On the one hand I am sort of glad because they must not have used any type of testing - animal or otherwise - because should you get even the tiniest amount in your eyes, it will burn your eyeballs out of their sockets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same goes for their eye serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a snake-oil selling company that needs to be avoided at all costs!</li>
    <li> I had a skin rash on my face after I used it.</li>
    <li> quick delivery, the jar is quiet big</li>
    <li> I have to say I am surprised with this product. I needed an eye cream that was good but did not break the bank. This eye cream got great reviews so I thought I would give it a try. Most eye creams have many promises and very few actually work. The first night I used this eye cream the light wrinkles around my eyes disappeared! Amazing! I am very pleased so far and hope it continues to work well! I will be purchasing the face cream I think now to try:)</li>
    <li> The Dead Sea eye cream helps take away puffy eyes in the morning.  It is a fabulous product and I have recommended it to other people as well.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I love this eye cream, I use it with the premier eye serum.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This appears to be the same product I purchased a year ago while in Las Vegas at a kiosk.  I paid double what I paid here.  I LOVE this product because it really works; however, the product I just received is half the price but somehow different.  It is not creamy like the other and when applied to my face is lumpy and does&#x27;t smooth out easily.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for myself and my daughter. We are both amazed at the results.Not only goes it assits in hydration, it pumps up your sking and we found results to be immediate. Would definitely recomment to everyone, well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this cream for a week, and it seems to work great. It is a perfect texture for the eye cream -- not too heavy, and not too light, and it leaves my skin silky-smooth!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream!  It is so silky smooth and feels great on the skin around my eyes!</li>
    <li> both the eye serum and the eye cream came in a timely manner and were both in perfect condition.  I would recommend either product for I am completely satisfied with them both..  It is the greatest eye product I have found in a long time do not go to the website itself the price is out of line Amazon sells the same product at a fraction of the cost..  Thank you for your great customer service</li>
    <li> This is not any better than any other eye cream I have tried--and for the cost--I would not recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I was excited after reading reviews to try this under my eyes for the lines and wrinkles I am getting. I have NOT felt or noticed ANY difference at all! Nothing! I have used it right away in the morning under makeup, and use it before bed. I would think using it twice a day I would have noticed SOMETHING! \\&quot;Maybe\\&quot; just \\&quot;Maybe\\&quot; it will help prevent new lines, but I bet ANY under eye cream, even from a Dollar store would do the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years after being introduced to it at a kiosk at the mall. This is a much cheaper way to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Non greasy easily aborbs under the eyes. Definitely reduces puffiness and tiredness. Just need a small amount as it goes a long way. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I did like it and was worth the money.  I would purchase again in the near future.  Last a long time.</li>
    <li> i have very sensitive skin around my eyes. so sensitive that i have allergic reactions to just about any product i try to use. eye lotion, eye shadow, eye liner... you name it! this eye cream actually helped heal my swollen skin and rash from the last product i tried to use. it feels soft and smells great. AND the container it comes in is huge! normal eye creams come in a 0.5 fluid oz bottle. this is 1.2 fluid ozs for the same price! very very pleased and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Only started using it about 2 weeks ago and love this product, a definate purchase again, I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Odd texture -- not smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Premier is the only line I will use, it works wonders!  Give it time though to work and you will be happy.  Ive been using it for 2 years and I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price. Nice container and large amount of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Just thought I would try since it was originally over $100.</li>
    <li> I feel good, I think it is effective, I hope I can change my constant use black rim of the eye</li>
    <li> This felt nice going on but after using almost the whole jar I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my eye area. I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true Olay eye cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I am allergic to cetyl alcohol and cetearyl alcohol and those ingredients were not listed in the description of this product. Stupid me put it on immediately upon receiving the package and then I read the fine print. Fortunately I did not have a reaction but since then I have only used it sparingly and not regularly, to avoid a reaction. I certainly don&#x27;t see any immediate results from the occasional use. I cannot use it daily because of the allergies. Wish I had read the package first, because then I would have just returned it.</li>
    <li> Used the product as directions indicated did not see any improvements or changes in the eye area, leaves a slight greasy feeling around the eyes and make up was hard to apply after applying the lotion.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;Hydrating and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it says it will deliver&lt;br /&gt;Will use again</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m very impressed with this eye cream, although I love Premier&#x27;s eye and facial serums, as well as their biox anti-aging cream.  To begin with, I&#x27;m fortunate in that I actually don&#x27;t have any wrinkles (yet), so I can&#x27;t attest to if it gets rid of wrinkles or not.  I&#x27;ve chronically had dark circles under my eyes and this cream does nothing for that.  It is extremely greasy compared to others I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t absorb very quickly.  Because of the greasiness, it then tends to \\&quot;migrate\\&quot; into my eyes, causing irritation.  I&#x27;m going to be trying something else as soon as I finish up this jar.</li>
    <li> Just received, a big bottle of eye cream.It is a friend introduced to me.I hope to be able to effectively.</li>
    <li> I am 59 and this cream has kept all the lines around my eyes gone. I LOVE this eye cream. I would never buy any other.</li>
    <li> You misleading the customers by showing a new line and as soon as we click then you showing the OLD line.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t remember ever getting this???  I&#x27;m sure if I had of liked it I would still be using it but frankly, I don&#x27;t remember ever getting it.</li>
    <li> I am 30. I felt this left my under eyes looking more creased than using no moisturizer at all. It felt greasy and did not feel nice to put on. I went back to using Bare Minerals eye moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I look 40 years younger...it&#x27;s a miracle.  Nobody recognizes me any more.  I am so hot now, and yesterday I was just a grandma!</li>
    <li> sometimes it goes to eyes, it fuzzy. very big volume 35g, it can be use for a LONG time. it is oil , but dry very fast.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is the same product that sells for well over $250?  Located here... [...]  Can&#x27;t believe that it is...Normally when things seem to good to be true, they usually are not.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my mother,the price is low,but i don&#x27;t know if it is good or bad.i think i will buy it again</li>
    <li> I like it. The delivery speed is good, But the package for the product is not well protected.It can open without using convenient bag.</li>
    <li> do not waste your money on this product, it does not work at all</li>
    <li> This too contributed to my watering eyes so I am not using it or the eye serum. I am disappointed that I can&#x27;t use either of these products.</li>
    <li> I use it all over my face because it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out like so many  other creams.</li>
    <li> I shot the Premier Usa Dead Sea Eye Cream (35 ml/1.20 oz), but it is received Gratiae Organics Ultrox Expression Marks Anti Wrinkle Cream, 1.7 Ounce, totally not what I want.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is nice and light but moisturizing. It is also a great primer for eye makeup.There really is no scent to it. It goes a long way! I bought this a while ago and didn&#x27;t use half. I am 27 and don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles but I do have black circles. I also like to try to do wrinkle prevention. There has been no difference in the black circles. The eye cream just makes under your eyes look healthier and maybe a little bit brighter. Its a good eye cream and you should try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it every night for a couple months and maybe my under eyes look a little better.  I&#x27;m not sure- but they definitely don&#x27;t look worse than before and I haven&#x27;t had any negative reaction to it.</li>
    <li> This works well and goes perfectly with the Premier Dead Sea Eye serum.  I love them both and see a big difference in the way the skin around my eyes looks and feels.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find this great product at such an affordable price. This sells for 6 times as much,  if you purchase elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I have ordered this product. Quick delivery and looking forward to the same great results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and still love it!  it lasts a long time as you only use a small portion.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product it made the puffiness and dark circles go away. I was happy and will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> This is another product that was sampled on the Big Island of Hawaii. I tried it and liked what I was told and thought I would try it</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face, neck,eye cream all in one.</li>
    <li> Premier&#x27;s eye cream is an excellent item. Used nightly, over and under the eyes, it eliminates lines and wrinkles, and definitely evaporates the years from a face --- particularly when followed by an under-eye dab of [[ASIN:B00115TXRE Premier Dead Sea Eye Serum]], which not so long ago sold for $100 for a tiny few-ounce jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Premier people must have been hard-hit by the global economic downturn, because they have more than halved their prices on most items. And while still expensive, I can attest from prior experience, they do work, and a few dabs of cream followed by a tiny drop of serum go the longest way.</li>
    <li> Wish the lifting action of this product was a little stronger.  If you cannot use retinol, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Have had good experiences with all products n deliveries on the products.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for many years, I really like the product and the whole product line.  I have not had any problem with this cream being old or ineffective.  Such a price saving from kiosk in mall.  I would imagine the company lets go of dated creams but the quality has been great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Fine lines are no longer visible.</li>
    <li> this light weight emulsion eye cream is just what the doctor ordered especially for this hot days of summer and the amount I received is just unheard of 1.20 oz.</li>
    <li> Say goodbye to those wrinkles, I apply this every night around my eyes and let the magic work as I get by beauty rest in.&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality and fraction of the cost you would spend buying it at the mall. Get your and watch those wrinkles disappear.</li>
    <li> If you want this product don&#x27;t buy in the mall as you can see cheap here,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how good the product is, it does a little, but your not paying that much as you can see,, what do you expect,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the serum and the eye cream,, roughly a total of $30 bucks which doesn&#x27;t cost much more than cream at walgreen&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;so my expectations are lowered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean this isn&#x27;t Dr Perricone stuff or Eye Serum from Erno Lazo or any of the other expensive creams. But what do you know what really is in the bottles and how much it really cost for them to manufacture? You don&#x27;t, I say you try a few different ones and find the one that works for you and your skin type. I mean $30 bucks total to try this isn&#x27;t much considering how much I pay for my Lazo Eye serum and cream and they raised the bar of sea mud soap from $20 to $40 now, which is lame, the soap has doubled in 10 years. Still I like the Erno Lazo for men best.</li>
    <li> does not fill in any lines, or even moisturize well.  I have used it faithfully for a solid month, twice a day, and I do not see one bit of difference in my skin.  Honestly I have had better results with Roc eye rollers.  this stuff....no.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this produt.</li>
    <li> A different brand of dead sea eye cream was sent.  Its called Gratiae.  It works fairly well too so I didn&#x27;t send it back.  It looks like the foil liner had been loosened and some of the product had been used.  That bugs me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years, and I don&#x27;t have the usual puffiness or dark circles like other women my age.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great!</li>
    <li> Very irritating under eye.  Left red, dry patches that burn.  Took a week to heal them.  Tried it again a couple of weeks later, just in case it was a fluke, and the same thing happened.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the same product I tried in the mall kiosk. That product actually took down puffiness and smoothed lines. This product hasn&#x27;t done anything for me other than make me break out with pimples around my eyes. Hasn&#x27;t done a thing for my laugh lines or puffiness. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> his helped my eyes look less baggy when used with the DS eye serum.&lt;br /&gt;I  keep buying this product since I think it helps.</li>
    <li> One of the best eye creams around and the price is unbelievable! Very happy with it and will order again.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product! As soon as the mail man knocked on the door, I ran up through the&lt;br /&gt;house, opened the door and took the box up stairs.  Cleaned my face and neck&lt;br /&gt;etc and used the eye cream.. I JUST COULDN&#x27;T WAIT! &#x3D;D  I have never had an&lt;br /&gt;eye cream that didn&#x27;t burn the skin around my eyes, except for this one.  I&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came quickly, the company is very friendly to deal with and this eye cream is great!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff! We were  in Key West and got pulled into this store trying to hock this stuff to us for $135! Found It here on Amazon for a fraction of the cost. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For me, it did NOT live up to all the hype.  It didn&#x27;t seem to work like what was used on me initially.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, my skin is very dry, and this cream is fantastic--and it is so much cheaper through Amazon than the kiosks in the malls.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as I thought it would</li>
    <li> For the girl of the house, she loves it</li>
    <li> It is light, something I like for my eyes, but I can not notice any difference about the benefits that this product offer.</li>
    <li> Worth the price.  Outstanding eye cream.  Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing eye cream.  gets rid of under eye wrinkles without redness or irritation. highly recommended.      [[ASIN:B000VER1RU Premier Dead Sea Biox Intensive Age Cream/Anti-age Complex, 2-Fluid Ounce]][[ASIN:B000VER1RU Premier Dead Sea Biox Intensive Age Cream/Anti-age Complex, 2-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> The product does not work as advertised. I used the product for 4 months with no results.  My puffiness was not reduced.  No miracle here.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described. The cream has a light texture and is easily absorbed. Leaves a nice glow</li>
    <li> I love this product! Finally I found something I will continue to use again and again. It is creamy and smells great. the best thing of all is I love the way my eyes look! It works! Thank you Premier!</li>
    <li> Tried samples of dead sea products from other companies and this did not seem to work as well.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smooth and clean feeling.  Four of us in our household use it, even me--a guy.  Great stuff, nothing too weird in it either.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream!  It hydrates the dry areas under my eye.  I think it has helped with darkness as well.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. It makes my eyes feel softer and feel more alive. The dark circles are not so noticable, and amazing. I&#x27;m 20 using an eye cream, because if you don&#x27;t want wrinkles in the future you need to start moisturizing now!  Moisturize me!!! (If you know that quote then you are my hero) But anyway this is wonderful and for the price I&#x27;m super excited about it because all the other products are at least 100 dollars no thanks :D Thanks amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the minority here. I&#x27;ve loved everything I&#x27;ve ever ordered from Premier until I tried this eye cream. The consistency and creaminess seemed impressive. Once on a few minutes, my eyes were watery and painful. Gave this cream to somebody else who loved it. I don&#x27;t know. Guess it&#x27;s great if it does not irritate your eyes. My eyes tend to be sensitive. I use only Perricone and Hydrolyze successfully</li>
    <li> Love!love!love! This eye cream.  Creamy, yet hydrates well.  Smells great and does a great job smoothing my delicate eye tissue.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this product, it felt silky and glide on smoothly.  The smell is also a plus...it has a soft smell like baby lotion on the eyes.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Not yet used,It looks nice</li>
    <li> no change noted to eye area after using almost a jar of cream</li>
    <li> I received my Premier 35ml Dead Sea Eye Cream today and it is great! It was packaged VERY well, the packaging of the product itself is beautiful- almost a rosey gold lid, and a deep teal glass bottom. Once I run out, I&#x27;ll probably purchase from them again!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this product.  It really works. My skin haven&#x27;t felt this good in a long time. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> My eye creams arrived today Sunday July 27th 2014.  These two creams have been opened prior to arrival so I put it back in the box and returning it tomorrow.  Obviously, someone tampered these creams.  Be careful everyone.  If it is NOT sealed, I advise you to return it.  You don&#x27;t know what is inside of it or if you are really using the genuine product.  How easy it is for them to replace the cream with something else… who knows???</li>
    <li> love the eye cream.Better than some big brands.</li>
    <li> Great Price! Only 15% of the original price, and the quality is better than I supposed.</li>
    <li> I love him. immediately feel the result, I definitely will use again.</li>
    <li> Good. I am not hell-bent on looking younger like a lot of women, but it does FEEL good on my paper thin under-eye skin.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal advertises this as a new product and it may be.  I haven&#x27;t seen it at the drug stores, as that&#x27;s where I usually buy cosmetics, but I really like the product.  It goes on so smoothly and even without foundation or mineral powder, it makes the skin look and feel nice.</li>
    <li> I can use very few products around my eyes because they are so sensitive to the ingredients or perfumes that are found in so many other products.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of different ones from Estee Lauder, Lancôme, Clinique and a few others but none compare to this product.  I use this along with the Premier eye serum and it helps to reduce the appearance of the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product about 3-4 weeks and I already see the reults. It made my skin uder eyes firmer and I got rid of the wreankles. Works even better in combination with other anti-wrinkle products. I use it with Bare esentuals \\&quot;firming eye treatment\\&quot; cream and I&#x27;m very satisfied. These 2 products together work perfectly</li>
    <li> I have an extremely busy lifestyle and barley have time some days to remember to put on my eye cream but I found when I started using constantly along with eye serum that this product worked wonders. Having fine lines and Unflattering dry skin under my eyes sent me on a desperate hunt to find a miracle worker and I caN say I found it in this eye cream when I started using it as instructed!</li>
    <li> I bought 4 items,it is fine,but the expiration date is JULY and AUGUST,so I must try my best to use it up,I can&#x27;t give as a present to my friend as I expected because of the expiration date.</li>
    <li> when I received them，I found 2 of them were not well sealed so that the oil leaked.</li>
    <li> This product does not work as eye cream.  But it comes in a big bottle, and I don&#x27;t want to waste it.  So I used it as body lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past.  The skin around the eyes is very thin and sensitive.  This moisturizes and absorbs quickly so makeup can be applied almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I receive the item, but it is opened.  I am not sure it isn&#x27;t be used. I&#x27;m worry about it.</li>
    <li> So far, this has been awsome, I also use the dead sea serum with this and for the first time since I started chemo my eyes look normal and not puffy all the away around, thank you Premier...for letting me at least look normal.</li>
    <li> I have been using Premiere Dead Sea Eye Cream now for three years, and I honestly can say that I &amp;#34;cannot&amp;#34; live without it! I have seen a MAJOR difference in my eye area almost immediately upon use. The elasticity, firmness and overall younger glow that it seem&#x27;s to give my whole face is just amazing. Before using this cream,  Just after turning 40 three years ago, I was starting to notice puffiness, dark circles and an overall tired and bloated look around my eyes. I needed a miracle....and fast! I can definitely say that Premiere Eye Cream IS my miracle:)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My skin is so soft and looks ageless. I use it all over my face, not just eyes. I get complimented on my face skin all the time.  I am 51 but look in my 30&#x27;s.  I will never change products!</li>
    <li> I have used Premier Dead Sea Eye cream for several years now and feel that the product reduces my wrinkles greatly.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> This product was not the quality I expected from a Dead Sea product. I have purchased eye cream products from other companies which produce products from the Dead Sea. This eye cream was inferior and doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claims. I am very disappointed because I thought I was purchasing a quality product.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t oily but i didn&#x27;t see any improvement after 8 weeks of use</li>
    <li> It was getting dried up.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like the feeling of this cream</li>
    <li> I have used almost every eye cream out there, and I rate this one similar to the one that costs 250.00 retail.  No names, most probably know which one I&#x27;m referring to.  Can be used day and night,  light easily absorbed, best to wait 5-10  minutes before putting eye make-up on. Been using this for 3 years now.</li>
    <li> This cream makes my skin feel so smooth and hydrated. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent eye cream for daily use.  I use it at night or during the day.  You also need very little.</li>
    <li> I bought an $80 eye cream that I tried at a makeup event which was sent to me through another store.  It was a smaller container than I anticipated.  I subsequently returned it and looked on Amazon for another eye cream.  I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for awhile and am very happy with the results.  It is super absorbent on your skin and you really only have to use a tiny bit.  I usually end up getting more than a dab on my finger and have to put it on other areas of my face.  I&#x27;m always on the lookout for quality beauty products and honestly bought this based on positive reviews.  So I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because it lives up to the reviews.  You have to be diligent and put it on at least once a day to get the desired results-less puffy, reduce dark circles.  It is a great product for the price, I&#x27;m happy to report!!</li>
    <li> I paid about $200 for this product at the mall. What a waste of money. I&#x27;ve been using this product, as directed, for over a month with absolutely no results. I wanted to brighten the area around my eyes and reduce the fine lines. Richard, the Dead Sea Spa representative in Roosevelt Mall promised all this would happen. $200 later, I am more than disappointed by the product and with their \\&quot;no refund policy\\&quot; I am against the products and the entire company. Completely unprofessional.</li>
    <li> Great product, reasonable price from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great packaging.  Product looks different from previously ordered product.</li>
    <li> Love the product my skin us sensitive and this is awesome for me...</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this Premier Dead Sea Eye Cream for 10 years, made in Israel from minerals from the Dead Sea. This eye cream is totally different from the product I have come to trust for the maintenance of my skin. I&#x27;m not sure because &amp;#34;Usa&amp;#34; is in the product name, if this means that this product is now manufactured here in the USA instead of Israel. If that is true, it is definitely an inferior product and should be advertised as such. This eye cream is very thin and doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same properties as the product from Israel.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  There&#x27;s quite a difference in the delicate skin around my eyes.  Buying from Amazon.com is much cheaper than the mall kiosk.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but it worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I tried a few times morning and night, but not like it at all. won&#x27;t buy or refer to others.</li>
    <li> I was approached in a mall and bought the eye serum at an unbelievably high price.  I thought I could probably have gotten it on Amazon for a much lower  price.  I could have.  So I bought this eye cream and it works really well.  Much lower price.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I use it on all over my face, neck and hands in addition to an eye cream.  I have very sensitive skin and this product is very mild and not heavy on perfume.</li>
    <li> Love it, thinking about getting another one.</li>
    <li> Bought because my wife needed a refill. Says that it works well, and plans to use until it does not. C6</li>
    <li> I love this product and it is as good as advertised..... The BEST! When i first heard it described , i thought yeah but we&#x27;ve heard so many times before about what ap product claims to do..... This eye cream is the best and the price is reasonable.....</li>
    <li> So I was stopped by a booth at a mall and given the sample of this along with a purchase of Dead Sea face scrub. Never has anything worked so good so I looked it up on line and was sold for a mere 250.00!  So, not really in my price range. Then one day looking on amazon for god knows what I somehow came upon the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; eye cream for 25.00!  I was so excited and ordered two, one for my mother and one for me. Totally not the same thing at all! Should of known by the huge price difference but it was packaged the same as the one sold on the Dead Sea mineral site so I jumped on it. Definitely an imposter, did nothing for me at all. Anyways... Just wanted to warn you all.</li>
    <li> Amazing price compared to retail.  The cream is wonderful, got rid of the wrinkles around my eyes in a week.  My mother is 70 years old and use this products as well and she had seen a great improvement as well.  Not completely gone but fading.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream ever!  I originally bought it at a mall kiosk for over $100. I was so happy when I saw it on amazon for cheap!!!  I was skeptical that it would be the same thing, but was willing to take the chance for $14. I got it, and it&#x27;s exactly the same stuff!&lt;br /&gt;If you want to know if this works...put it on one eye only, wait a minute, and look at the difference.  HUGE difference!!</li>
    <li> love this brand cuz it works!!!  Will order again</li>
    <li> A reasonable eye cream for $15. Don&#x27;t buy this at a Dead Sea kiosk. They&#x27;ll charge you well over $100.</li>
    <li> My wife said cream a little greasy, cosmetics can not be quickly see the effect, maintenance, hope such as introduction, pure natural without side effects</li>
    <li> This odd little tray-pot has a standard plastic shield between the dome lid and the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dome twists off in one easy swipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white, creamy moisturizer inside is very condensed -- you need only a very tiny amount on a fingertip, and it spreads on contact with warm skin perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin doesn&#x27;t feel taut or stretched, but wrinkles and sags are mitigated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company, Premier, has some kind of science behind it that even L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> this is the first time i use it, it is perfect, smoothly. and good price from Amazon, i will return again once it run out.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product -- and the price compared to kiosks and spas.</li>
    <li> bought the 2 they used at mall saved alot of money. when they put on at mall i seen difference in hydration under eyes,needless to say it did nothing when i got it home, weird, did it exactly same way and same 2 products unless theres a shelf life to it.</li>
    <li> I do not use this product I purchased it for my girlfriend and she said she likes it, a bit pricy but it keeps her happy</li>
    <li> living in the desert it is paramount to care for one&#x27;s skin&lt;br /&gt;most over-the-counter creams merely clog the pores.&lt;br /&gt;The results with Dead Sea Eye Cream have been&lt;br /&gt;above expectations.  I highly recommend their line of products</li>
    <li> I wanted to share my personal experience with a store on Lincoln Road in Miami called Brilliance New York that sells the Premier line of cosmetics.  My friend visited the store yesterday looking for a non-premier product.  The nefarious store saleswoman immediately began shoving the Premier line of products in his face.  She began first by smearing the eye serum all over his eyes and the eye cream next, stating \\&quot;look!!!  Can&#x27;t you see how much better you look?\\&quot;  The bottle was clogged, and she could not use the pump to get the eye serum out of the bottle.  But, she said that it is best to unscrew the damn thing and dab a bit on your finger instead of using the pump.  What???  Do these people get trained how to come up with idiotic lies prior to selling these products? None of the Premier cosmetics in this store had prices marked on the products whatsoever.  She told my friend that the eye serum was $299 as well as the eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he seemed shocked over the prices, her response was, \\&quot;listen...I had a great day...I can sell you each for $249.\\&quot;  Still shocked over the prices, she began grabbing shaving cream and another product he had no interest in and said, \\&quot;I can offer you these for free, $400 for both the serum and eye cream together, and a facial.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, he left the store without purchasing anything and told me the entire story when it was over.  He checked on Amazon and saw that he could buy the products for $20 each, and then began reading some of the reviews written by customers who were ripped off by kiosks in malls and stores who also sell the Premier line of cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to visit the store myself to speak with the manager to let him know that I was aware of their corrupt business practices.  When I informed the manager that I knew that you could buy a $249 Premier product online at Amazon for $20, he told me that he was aware of this, he KNEW everyone that sold the products on Amazon, and that all of the Premier products sold on that website were past the expiration date.  LIAR!!!  He told me that on the U.S. website for Premier, the product is $249.  I told him that my friend was quoted $299 just one day ago, and he said that no salesperson in his store would sell the product above the Premier website&#x27;s price of $249.  LIAR!!!!!  He went on to tell me that he would sell both the eye serum and eye cream together for $249.  I then told him that the salewoman offered him both products for $200 yesterday.  When he asked me who quoted that price to him, I pointed her out in the store, and he said that it was not possible that she would ever offer that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a FACT:  stores or kiosks who sell Premier products are CORRUPT.  My heart breaks for anyone who has been ripped off by these vile con artists who seem to relish in lying straight to a customer&#x27;s face, who work for villainous companies that sell over-priced poor products, and seem to lack a good work ethic.  Karma is a bitch, and what goes around comes around.  Brilliance New York on Lincoln Road in Miami is a store that must be avoided.</li>
    <li> Packaging very unwieldy and crème seemed ineffective.</li>
    <li> So, let me first start off on the overall performance of this eye cream.  It feels really nice on the skin.  Really feels like it is moisturizing my under eye area.  The only thing is that I feel like it is a little too heavy for wearing under makeup.  Even if I put a face powder on top of my makeup, my eye make up will run due to the heaviness of the moisturizer.  To counter this, I apply baby powder or cornstarch under my eyes.  So I do like it b/c I bought it to moisturizer my delicate eye area.  My biggest issue with this product is the packaging.  I don&#x27;t mind small pots of moisturizer but this one is really big and it has that annoying plastic cover that sits on the inside that you have to remove every time you open it.  Yes, I can throw it out but then it just ends up every where when I open it.  It would be wonderful if the packaging could be a tube to easily apply the formula to your finger.</li>
    <li> I love all the Dead Sea products!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and love it. But, the best thing about this was dealing with the seller. When I ordered the product it arrived in a blink, I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly. And, to make things even nicer, the seller included a free gift of a lovely product. I could not be more pleased with the product or with the seller.</li>
    <li> This cream is nothing special . I tried the same cream in the kiosk at the shopping mall and it works really well but the price is very high.  I think this cream has different ingredients.</li>
    <li> such a rip-off.. don&#x27;t waste your money. Other products, oil of olay, are soooo much  better.</li>
    <li> OK. Very fast delivery</li>
    <li> Nice soft, non greasy eye cream. Was in the mall this holiday season, saw a kiosk with these products. I was roped into trying this eye cream, and the eye serum. They felt wonderful and I immediately wanted them.....until I was told their cost . The eye cream was $99.00. The serum, to help alleviate wrinkles...(works great!! ) was $199.00.  I came home and immediately looked on Amazon, saw the HUGE savings I would have, and purchased the set.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy I did. Would highly recommend these products.&lt;br /&gt;Linda Calcaterra&lt;br /&gt;Manalapan, N. J.</li>
    <li> Finally an eye m that works. Seriously I&#x27;ve tried all kinds, this is the only one that helps if you problems with having bags under your eyes. They didn&#x27;t go away completely, but Dead Sea Eye Cream helps minimize the bag look.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream and it absorbs really quickly. It makes the eye area smooth and really hydrated. thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use this every night &amp; I also use the eye serum too. It lasts me over a year &amp; not greasy. It seems to go in the skin &amp; prevents wrinkles from getting any deeper.</li>
    <li> this product was opened when I got it. got a credit, but threw it away. Yuck! the product itself, very nice.</li>
    <li> This products does not go at all into the skin, even when using a very small amount, and does absolutely nothing for the eye area. After using it for 5 weeks there was no difference except that the skin was and looked dry and dehydrated.</li>
    <li> I just love the way this cream goes on my eyelids and makes my eyes feel!  It helps with wrinkles better than many other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> the box was wrapped , however done in a gross way. When I opened the product , I saw that the cream was not their usual rich eye cream program.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like regular Nivea cream......&lt;br /&gt;dissapointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that old recipents are used, reconditioned and filled in with super non expensive products.</li>
    <li> This is the best under eye cream I have ever used. It smoothes out the wrinkles under my eyes. This is the third time I have purchased this cream.</li>
    <li> The eye cream works really well to conceal dark circles around the eyes and gives the eyes a refreshing look.</li>
    <li> 2nd jar this stuff works great for me</li>
    <li> Premier eye cream is very rich and luxurious, my fine lines have vanished and you get so much for your money you can lavish it on.</li>
    <li> The perfect complement to the serum.  Eyes look brighter and younger</li>
    <li> fantastic cream and service way better than eBay!!!!  I now buy everything books cases covers all from amazon and mugs awesome</li>
    <li> The foil was opened and the cream had spilled out around the rim of the jar.  Very disappointed. Looked like it&#x27;s been used.</li>
    <li> The jar was 2/3 full.  There was a second part of a waxy disc in a lid compartment that was dried up.  I wrote a letter to the address on the shipping label but it was returned to me as undeliverable. I would like my money back or a new jar of product.</li>
    <li> No fragrance and it feels great applying it.  The wrinkles around my eyes are reduced and my eyes look younger and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I use this after the eye serum. Nice smell and a nice, smooth consistency. Like with all Premier products, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff!!</li>
    <li> FEELS GOOD AND GOES A LONG WAY</li>
    <li> Like the eye serum I use this product all over my face and I like it very much. My husband has also noticed a difference in his face.</li>
    <li> I love this product --took a chance, had never used it before, but I love the product for the value</li>
    <li> I use this eye cream as a face moisturizer! Absorbs fast without any greasiness. Leaves skin looking fresh and glowing</li>
    <li> The product is very good</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product ...great service,got the product right away...terrific product..used it for about 2 years..works very well..reduces fine lines and puffiness and dark circles,takes about 2 weeks to see results,</li>
    <li> size runs small,didn&#x27;t fit ,to tight.would recommend getting a size larger then ,that way when you wash it ,it will fit properly.</li>
    <li> Need more time to give it a fair trial.  Not pleased in one week use. The sample applied did miracles on my puffy eye but the one I ordered has NOT one the same.</li>
    <li> The eye cream is quite rich which is just right for me.  Great products considering they are at 70-90 discount from the mall.  I would definitely buy all my Premier Dead Sea products from Amazon.  They are identical from the mall.  Save you the money to spend on something else.  Your skin thanks you and your pocket book thanks you too.</li>
    <li> This product used with the company&#x27;s eye serum reduces the puffiness under the eyes.  You can see the difference before and after usage.</li>
    <li> A great eye cream for women in last 50&#x27;s early 60&#x27;s when used with they eye serum. Great moisture and firming under eye and crows feet and eye brow. Younger women can use it and it will help them not have many lines around eyes as they get older. I love the eye cream and serum. I would tell a friend about this product.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly the same as sold in stores at substantially higher prices. Works very well around the delicate eye area.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000VEWF2Q Premier Dead Sea Eye Cream, 1.1800-Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;I recently received a sample from Neiman Marcus. The sample literally sat in the bottom of my shopping bag for about a week. I thought one night let me try this since i had ran out the eye cream I use by strivectin. Well lo and behold I tell you I could see a difference in the appearance of my eyes in about a week. the fine lines were not as noticeable. I went to Nordstroms to see if they offered it. They do not carry the product. I was telling the sales girl that I planned on ordering it. She advised me to check on amazon first before ordering from there website... And Boy am I glad that i did. I just ordered it for 29.00 compared to 150.00. THis made my day! and i can&#x27;t wait to receive my order.</li>
    <li> This product is more like lotion than an eye cream.  Not what I expected from the branding.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream, have used it for a year and wanted more. Non irritating and soothing as well as reducing puffiness. It also makes my eyes look younger I think.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and reordered it because I really like it. It is very light but seems to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I see no benefits with this product. Find it irrelevant.</li>
