      <li>I live in Florida with olive skin that hyperpigments very easily.</li>
      <li>The original left an amazing glow and moisterised feeling.</li>

      <li>This originally was given to me by mistake, but this sunscreen really works and helps keep your skin glowing, I really would recommend to those who want to keep their skin looking young.</li>
      <li>The spf really protects my skin against sunburn.  </li>
      <li>I spent more money than I used to on this product, not knowing the formulas&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;been</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and definitely protects your skin from sun damage.</li>
      <li>Now I feel I am aging fast.  </li>
      <li>Have used it for years and really like the tint, protection from the sun, and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>

      <li>but since it&#x27;s tinted, I can use it as foundation that is completely invisible!</li>
      <li>The biggest issues I have with this product is its over-priced price tag and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t hydrate my skin as the old formula did.</li>
      <li>Looks natural.</li>
      <li>The newer version is nothing like the original and, does not look the same, a smaller amount and smaller container.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll save money next time and go back to Neutrogena&#x27;s higher spf formula for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>you will be disappointed but still worth the investment if your looking for a good sunblock.</li>
      <li>I used the Ti-Silc sheer for nearly 16 years and all of a sudden--poof!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to people that don&#x27;t mind over paying for a face cream and have really oily skin or will only use it during the summer, when your skin won&#x27;t suffer of dry skin.</li>
      <li>messing up on sunscreen is not a minor problem</li>
      <li>They are charging twice as much for a bottle half the size.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pricey but a little goes a long way.  Gives just a little natural finish and the sun screen part seems to work well.  This product was recommended by an esthetician.  I have been using it for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> Loved the Neova tri silc sunscreen until I had to order more and realized they changed the ingredients! They claim it is a new improved, but it isn&#x27;t! It left my skin looking dull and dry. The original left an amazing glow and moisterised feeling. Sorely disappointed and will now have to find something else! Fast delivery and service to Amazon though!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past.and I loved it. The bottle that I received this time is different and not as shown.I hope the product is the same</li>
    <li> works perfect on my face.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen for rosacea type skin.  Gives you just the amount of glow and coverage you need.</li>
    <li> It is a great product.</li>
    <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FANTASTIC SELLER~LOVE NEOVA SUNSCREEN IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT~SPEEDY SHIPPING~A DEFINITE 5 STAR RATING IS DESERVED HERE.</li>
    <li> I used this product for years and loved it and the way it made my complexion look.  The newer version is nothing like the original and, does not look the same, a smaller amount and smaller container.  Very disappointed and wish they would bring the original version back.</li>
    <li> have totally relied on the original for many years.  this new product is awful. looks pasty and texture is weird.  leaves skin very dry almost immediately. this WAS a wonderful product.  messing up on sunscreen is not a minor problem</li>
    <li> Was introduced to this sunscreen a number of years ago. It goes on my face everyday after i apply my moisturizer.  I apply my makeup over it. My face is protected from the harmful rays from the sun.</li>
    <li> After my last visit to the dermatologist, it was recommended that I begin using neova sunscreen daily.  I love the easy pump dosage meter &amp; the feel of the lotion on my face.  I have used it for several months including trips to the beach.  The spf really protects my skin against sunburn.  This product also recommended for wrinkle prevention.</li>
    <li> This originally was given to me by mistake, but this sunscreen really works and helps keep your skin glowing, I really would recommend to those who want to keep their skin looking young.</li>
    <li> This new formula is horrible!!! Not only do you get alot less product for a more inlated price,but the quailty is terrible.The orginal product was silky and gave you a glow,this product is drying and more orange.Very disappointed and will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Instead of makeup sheer and great protection!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Looks natural. Not white</li>
    <li> Love it!  I is such a pleasure to shop through amazon!  Getting such a wonderful product!  Light!  Protects! Looks luminously !  😘</li>
    <li> Im so disappointed...I spent more money than I used to on this product, not knowing the formulas&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;been completely changed! Its no longer sheer and illuminating under my makeup, but heavy and matte.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll save money next time and go back to Neutrogena&#x27;s higher spf formula for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> You guy&#x27;s have impeccable service,  as well as AMAZING products!!  I&#x27;m a customer for life!  Keep up the phenomenal work!</li>
    <li> I used the Ti-Silc sheer for nearly 16 years and all of a sudden--poof! Gone. Too bad, too, as this product is nothing like Ti-Silc sheer. They are charging twice as much for a bottle half the size. This is a lackluster product, so if you are looking for a replacement for Ti-Silc sheer, this isn&#x27;t it. Save your money and try something else.</li>
    <li> excellent product feels good on the skin and has skin tone tint which blends with light to medium complexions</li>
    <li> Makes your skin soft love it</li>
    <li> Neova Silk Sheer is a wonderful product!  I started using this years ago when recommended by a doctor.  I had been unable to use other products due to breakouts and allergic reaction.  Have had no problem with this product and love the light coverage it provides</li>
    <li> I normally sunburn very easy but I have never burned while using neova , I use it daily</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a dermatologist and love it.  It does not give you a cakey heavy make up appearance but provides good UV protection.  I use it under Bear Minerals product and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I use the product every morning. Have used it for years and really like the tint, protection from the sun, and the way it makes my skin feel. I have recommended to several friends.</li>
    <li> I am 46 years old and have very acne prone skin.  This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t make me break-out! Not only that, but since it&#x27;s tinted, I can use it as foundation that is completely invisible! My skin looks clean and radiant and it&#x27;s actually benefitting from the sunscreen because it has DNA repair in it! If you want a sunscreen you&#x27;ll happily wear everyday, this is your product!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen. It provides coverage with just the right amount of pigment so I don&#x27;t have a white face. I use it over my moisturizer or over my foundation. It&#x27;s a creamy sunscreen without any fragrance.</li>
    <li> BEST for skin that hyperpigments. I live in Florida with olive skin that hyperpigments very easily. This is the best I have used</li>
    <li> I used to use the old Neova silc sheer product which was perfect...and then they changed it to this new formula which also costs more. The biggest issues I have with this product is its over-priced price tag and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t hydrate my skin as the old formula did. When I wear it all day during the winter, I find that it doesn&#x27;t hydrate the area around my mouth as the rest of my face. I end up applying another moisturizer to combat the dryness around this area. I have used neutrogrena  in comparison and this one does the trick; however, this ones makes my T zone more oiler than when I use the Neova. I would recommend this product to people that don&#x27;t mind over paying for a face cream and have really oily skin or will only use it during the summer, when your skin won&#x27;t suffer of dry skin.</li>
    <li> Looking for larger size.  The product really is nice.</li>
    <li> I used Ti-silc for about 15 years through the cosmetic surgeon I worked with,  it&#x27;s not intended to be a moisturizer or a make up because of its tint, it&#x27;s still a great product when used as sunblock. If you used the Ti-silc you will be disappointed but still worth the investment if your looking for a good sunblock. You&#x27;ll get use to the change, at least I did.</li>
    <li> I have used Ti Silc for many years and was disappointed to learn it was discontinued.  I decided to try the new product and I am very unhappy.  My face feels dry and the product seems to not moisturize at all.  The old product really kept my skin silky and with a dewy glow.  Now I feel I am aging fast.  If any one had another product to recommend, please let me know.  I miss my product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has a light tint and makes your face look fabulous. No need for other makeup. It goes on smooth and definitely protects your skin from sun damage. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Great product I have used for years.</li>
