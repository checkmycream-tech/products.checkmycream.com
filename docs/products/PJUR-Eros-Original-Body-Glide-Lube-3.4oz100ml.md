      <li>The PJUR products I&#x27;ve used are about adding a more glide than you might get naturally or without aid.</li>

      <li>This personal lube is the best, hands down (pun intended).</li>
      <li>Much better than traditional water based products.  </li>

      <li>she was upset at first.</li>
      <li>Do not use to much!  </li>
      <li>not greasy very slick works great</li>
      <li>He asked me where this had been his whole life?  </li>
      <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, in a very agreeable way.</li>
      <li>it is the right amount of fun, My wife got this before the actual gift I ordered so</li>
      <li>It implies that this product is somehow different from the original body glide -</li>
      <li>It is labelled as and is actually the original body glide.  </li>
      <li>This is actually the original body glide with the word eros added to the descriptive label to make it appear that you are getting something other than the original.  </li>
      <li>No weird fragrance, feels amazing for whatever you choose to use it for and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>we use for clitoral stimulation, vaginal intercourse (when rarely needed), and for occasional anal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The lubrication feels natural, but I found it takes more than a few drops.  </li>
      <li>I have reviewed the larger size of this product, and this is my \\&quot;purse size\\&quot; companion to the large bottle for the bedroom.</li>
      <li>Not to mention after his long days of work, its great to rub down those hard muscles with Pjur.  </li>
      <li>Hours of fun await you and your lover with this slick stuff.</li>

<li> Sorry astroglide, if you are second only to nature, PJUR IS nature!</li>
<li> Just a little pricey.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few of these as gifts to friends.</li>
<li> and you&#x27;ll know what I mean.</li>
<li> Not sticky and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin or leave behind stains.  </li>
<li> If you find sex dirty and disgusting you might not need this at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent product, highly recommended. Lasts a long time, and helps a great deal for the love machine.</li>
    <li> I have reviewed the larger size of this product, and this is my \\&quot;purse size\\&quot; companion to the large bottle for the bedroom. This stuff is amazing. It feels natural, is long lasting and not sticky! Hours of fun await you and your lover with this slick stuff.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t think of any other lube product that has the longevity and effectiveness than this lube.  No drying or stickiness.  Actually feels like a moisturizer after washing too.  Plus, I can&#x27;t believe a small amount goes this long distance.  Truly a god-send product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good stuff.  Not sticky and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin or leave behind stains.  Lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> I only order this stuff now -- this is my fourth bottle. No weird fragrance, feels amazing for whatever you choose to use it for and a little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve ordered a few of these as gifts to friends. Buy it. You (and your partner) will love it!</li>
    <li> Good lube.  Me and the wife love it and better price than competitor&#x27;s.  Just realize that just a little can go a long way.</li>
    <li> Having tried numerous other such products over the years with the wife, we&lt;br /&gt;find this one is simply the best in every way.  Not at all \\&quot;wattery\\&quot; or&lt;br /&gt;annoying to deal with.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, in a very agreeable way.</li>
    <li> This personal lube is the best, hands down (pun intended). It helps the ship cut through the waves for a super fun ride. Can also be used to lube the body to prepare for your journey!! I will purchase again, very soon!!!!</li>
    <li> not greasy very slick works great no fragrance very good product recommend to everyone that needs lube we like it</li>
    <li> This is a quality product and may be what you want for long sessions.  The lubrication feels natural, but I found it takes more than a few drops.  It lasts, but my main complaint is that it requires soap and water to remove the residue.  I don&#x27;t always feel like scrubbing up after sex, so I think I will stick to water-based lubes from now on.</li>
    <li> Maybe it is just me, but I do have a problem with the labelling.  The word Eros is deceptive.  It implies that this product is somehow different from the original body glide - that is why I ordered it.  The original body glide which I also ordered is a superior product.  When I received the \\&quot;Eros\\&quot; version I thought there had been a mistake.  No where on the bottle does the word \\&quot;eros\\&quot; appear.  It is labelled as and is actually the original body glide.  If you magnify the image for this product you will see that the word \\&quot;eros\\&quot; is not there.  This is actually the original body glide with the word eros added to the descriptive label to make it appear that you are getting something other than the original.  \\&quot;Eros\\&quot; needs to be removed from the description.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s supposed to be used primarily as a \\&quot;personal\\&quot; lubricant, but I use just a few drops all year &#x27;round on my hands to keep them from drying out and cracking. It also works great keeping my golden retriever&#x27;s coat shiny and the dander to a minimum if you apply just a few drops between the shoulder blades about once a month.</li>
    <li> Tried most, love this. Sorry astroglide, if you are second only to nature, PJUR IS nature! Not sticky at all. Tasteless, odorless, stays out of the way and lets you enjoy the moment instead of thinking about the lubrication the entire time. Hopefully, that makes sense. Grab some of this and you&#x27;ll know what I mean.</li>
    <li> Some of the best lube I&#x27;ve used! If your partner is larger or has a lot of girth to them this is the stuff to use! It doesn&#x27;t break down easy and it makes sex very comfortable!</li>
    <li> This product was part of a gag gift. Love this stuff it is the right amount of fun, My wife got this before the actual gift I ordered so she was upset at first. Speed of shipping was extremely fast, Product is top of the line, packaging was spot on.</li>
    <li> bought this on recommendation from a mariage website and it is everything they say. It is a great massaging oil and also a very good personal lube for my wife.</li>
    <li> The PJUR products I&#x27;ve used are about adding a more glide than you might get naturally or without aid. If there is a down side to having more sexual fun I don&#x27;t see it. If you find sex dirty and disgusting you might not need this at all. It is condom safe. That&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> only lube my wife and I use, after trying many others (ky, etc). one bottle lasts us way longer than a year; just bought another, and I honestly can&#x27;t remember when I bought the last one, probably 2-4 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a tiny bit goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need gobs of it like you do with some of the water based ones. also, it is more &amp;#34;concentrated&amp;#34; than some cheaper silicon based alternatives. we use for clitoral stimulation, vaginal intercourse (when rarely needed), and for occasional anal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worth the price, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this think it was normal sexual lube, but when it arrived I wasn&#x27;t too disappointed as I was thinking of buying a massage lubricant any ways. It works well and feels wonderful. It also lasts long. The only worry I have about this product is its ingredients, nothing springs out as harmful, but I&#x27;m sure there are more healthy massage oils out there.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. So smooth. You only have to apply it once and it goes a really long way. Ive been using it for awhile and way better than water based lubrication by far.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully!  Girlfriend loves it and so do I.  Excellent for &#x27;backdoor&#x27; activities and a must have for such things.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay if you like to change the sheets and anything you have touched while using this project.  We do not recommend it hightly...that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Much better than traditional water based products.  Just remember, a little goes a long way.  Do not use to much!  need lube?  This is your product!  Just a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Lets just say I got this to assist my man friend for his alone time, and for us as a couple during Long sessions at home.  He asked me where this had been his whole life?  Not to mention after his long days of work, its great to rub down those hard muscles with Pjur.  Worth every penny.  Trust me.</li>
