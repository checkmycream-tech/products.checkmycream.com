      <li>It was ok.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t start loosing more, but just sleeping much better</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and so did my wife, brother and cousin who all tried it for 6 months or more.  </li>
      <li>pretty good.  </li>
      <li>so I was glad to fine it here.</li>
      <li>but it was a huge letdown.</li>
      <li>Not only do I get a great night of sleep, but I awaken feeling fabulous.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure with a responsible diet and more exercise</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>I used to use the original relacore &amp; saw results</li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it has a lot of natural herbs and stress is a huge factor for me</li>
      <li>I have had great success with the daytime version of this and just thought I&#x27;d add this to give myself a little more &amp;#34;oomph.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>I purchased the Relacore PM more for the anxiety and stress components and I can really tell the difference in my mood.</li>
      <li>took this years ago and really like it helped me sleep better</li>
      <li>Have been using this for a week now and have found my moods better and my anxiety levels much lower.  </li>
      <li>This product does exactly what is says!</li>
      <li>BUT...after taking them for a month, I find that I actually sleep better and do no get up to eat during the night, which was a problem for me!</li>
      <li>I wake feeling relaxed and calm.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the product thus far.</li>
      <li>I have tried just about every diet pill and \\&quot;buy our food\\&quot; diet without any success.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>You have to exercise and eat right.</li>
      <li>Try it and see if it is right for you.</li>
      <li>And since it is getting harder to find at a retail store, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available here.</li>
      <li>We enjoy this product and sleep well with it naturally!</li>
      <li>i hope this helps anyone whos thinking of trying relacore and relacore pm for the first time.</li>
      <li>I am glad to finally have my Relacor again.</li>
      <li>I slept better and didn&#x27;t have the same amount of water weight issues.  </li>
      <li>well, as many of you know, they have changed the formula from a while back and then the packaging and now from capsule to tablet.  </li>
      <li>they need to bring back the original!</li>
      <li>First night I couldn&#x27;t really sleep.</li>
      <li>Definitely helps me sleep at night better than many other supplements.</li>
      <li>A natural path doctor first told us of this and they were right, it works.</li>
      <li>I assume most of the positive reviews are paid for because some companies pay other companies to review and purchase products online.  </li>
      <li>I appreciated so much.</li>
      <li>thanks again Carlena</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work as advertized</li>
      <li>this product really helps me sleep now</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t see any real benefits from using it.</li>
      <li>but it made me really sleepy.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really believe that these would work...</li>
      <li>it really does help to reduce it.</li>
      <li>Hasn&#x27;t helped with fat burning but it really helps me sleep.</li>
      <li>Im very relaxed.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice to much change in mood, stress or anxiety, nor did I notice any change in sleeping.</li>
      <li>I work at night so the PM formula really helps with sleep.</li>
      <li>I find that it helps me sleep and keeps my  tummy down try it for yourself and you will be pleased</li>
      <li>I have lost more than half of my belly fat without any effort.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think anybody has any older boxes of the capsules, so I got the tablets.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I actually seemed to sleep better when I didn&#x27;t take this and piggy back on PM sleep med.</li>
      <li>came highly reccomended.</li>
      <li>ive been over weight almost my whole adult life, and i have tried every diet pill.</li>
      <li>Already on the normal Relacore for daytime.</li>
      <li>Word of caution, make sure you do drink the entire glass of water recommended and do not take on a completely empty stomach, caused me to wake up with almost migraine level headaches.</li>
      <li>and I weigh exactly the same.  </li>
      <li>Wish they never altered the formula of the original Relacore, that one worked well for me, kept me active &amp; helped me maintain weight.</li>
      <li>I have recommended RELACORE to numerous friends and family who have obtained similiar positive results, Try it, you have nothing to lose but the belly fat.</li>
      <li>It is really to early to comment on this product</li>
      <li>at least helps me sleep :)</li>
      <li>It also does really help enhance your mood and ability to sleep... but the key word is HELP.</li>
      <li>far as taking the Relacore, I felt no side effects.  </li>
      <li>I cannot say that I have seen an accelerated difference since I started doing this, but as far as a sleep aid, it seems to take the edge off a bit.  </li>
      <li>i could understand but 4 of the same makes me sure this product is a waste of money.  </li>
      <li>My only reget on the product is it&#x27;s not as fresh as I&#x27;d like, expiration is next month.</li>
      <li>its worth the money spent.</li>
      <li>I am not extremely obese nor is anyone else i know who tried this product</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I took it several days and it did not help me at all. I ended up throwing it away as I did not see a &amp;#34; get your money back&amp;#34; guarantee.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any differance.</li>
    <li> My wife has been taking this product for several months already and says that it has reduced her stomach size considerably. An added bonus is that she has been sleeping better and feels more refreshed in the mornings.</li>
    <li> This a really good product if taken correctly along with a exercise plan.  Along with eating healthy without this these pills are not a substitute. You have to exercise and eat right.</li>
    <li> I work at night so the PM formula really helps with sleep. I purchased the Relacore PM more for the anxiety and stress components and I can really tell the difference in my mood. I haven&#x27;t been taking it long enough to tell whether it helps with belly fat. I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the product thus far.</li>
    <li> i used the original version of this product both day and night and loved them! but the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version sucks!  it made me jittery and i could not sleep. and did not help at all. i waisted my money!  they need to bring back the original!</li>
    <li> I really like the regular relacore, but this PM formula kept me wide awake.</li>
    <li> I am glad to finally have my Relacor again. It arrived as promised. And since it is getting harder to find at a retail store, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available here. Just wish the wait wasn&#x27;t so long.</li>
    <li> made my hair fall out.. took this years ago and really like it helped me sleep better but not sure what they did to it but would not recommend it</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I rarely have trouble sleeping, but on occasion when I am worried or upset about something i will take a Relacore PM and it all goes away. Not only do I get a great night of sleep, but I awaken feeling fabulous.  It even makes me feel sooooo good while I&#x27;m sleeping. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable using it and have found it does help me somewhat keep things in check.  Use the P.M. as well</li>
    <li> I took this for only one day! It made me feel really light headed and weird. I have 20 pds that I need to loose and I just wanted something to help me. I liked the fact that it has a lot of natural herbs and stress is a huge factor for me but it made me really sleepy. Maybe this will work for some people, just not for me.....</li>
    <li> I followed the directions, cut my fat and carb intake, took a 30 minute brisk walk each day and lost nothing.  I kept this up for two months and have had no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars just because I had to give it something.  I don&#x27;t want to exactly say it was all Relacore that failed.  It could be just me becuase I have tried just about every diet pill and \\&quot;buy our food\\&quot; diet without any success. I have also spent money on gyms with very little success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as taking the Relacore, I felt no side effects.  No jitters, thirst, hunger, gas or other bowel problems.</li>
    <li> this product really helps me sleep now if i could just take every night i might loss some weight. it not a sleeping pill it helps you to relax.</li>
    <li> I am 29 female. First night I couldn&#x27;t really sleep. Ended up taking a PM sleep med as well. I did not and have not noticed any weight loss while taking this. I didn&#x27;t change any habits, not did I include any exercise. With any diet supplement I would assume it works best when adding the exercise and diet change. Can&#x27;t expect fat to just melt away without doing anything extra. Wouldn&#x27;t that be nice! I didn&#x27;t notice to much change in mood, stress or anxiety, nor did I notice any change in sleeping. I actually seemed to sleep better when I didn&#x27;t take this and piggy back on PM sleep med. Just my experience. Try it and see if it is right for you.</li>
    <li> Helps me to relax and sleep</li>
    <li> waiting for the &amp;#34;break through&amp;#34; no results yet after 2 1/2 weeks. came highly reccomended. if results occur, will reply back!</li>
    <li> I have been using RELACORE for approximately 2 1/2 months and it really works. I have lost more than half of my belly fat without any effort. Besides the physical results, I awaken refreshed and rejuvenated, with RELACORE there are no side effects just results. I have recommended RELACORE to numerous friends and family who have obtained similiar positive results, Try it, you have nothing to lose but the belly fat.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know yet.  Lost no pounds or inches.  Email me back in two weeks.</li>
    <li> Best natural sleep supplement out there and that helps with stress management which helps maintain a healthy diet &amp; exercise. I don&#x27;t know if it helps with weight loss or not. I&#x27;ve been loosing 10 lbs a month with diet and exercise on the day time formula; without it 7 lbs a month. I didn&#x27;t start loosing more, but just sleeping much better and that is crucial for me. Love this stuff and will get more.</li>
    <li> Wish they never altered the formula of the original Relacore, that one worked well for me, kept me active &amp; helped me maintain weight. Needless to say, this one didn&#x27;t work anymore &amp; didn&#x27;t put me to sleep either. It&#x27;s loaded with B-vitamins &amp; that means if you tend to eat late at night even a small snack, those vitamins would be converted into energy instead... so how would you be able to sleep then? This is my experience, I tried it once, but I won&#x27;t buy it again. Try it if you&#x27;d like &amp; see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> Just added this to our regimen and it seems to be making a difference. Already on the normal Relacore for daytime.</li>
    <li> helps me sleep at night</li>
    <li> I have been able to sleep better and I wake up refreshed!  This worked for me starting on day 3!  I am very impressed and i&#x27;d suggest this to everyone who&#x27;s life threw them a curve and they can&#x27;t sleep.  It didn&#x27;t do anything for weight loss. 3 weeks in and I weigh exactly the same.  I bout it as a sleep aid and it is an excellent one.</li>
    <li> I know it is advertised for weightloss, and it might help a little, but I use it as a sleep aide during high stress times.  I wake feeling relaxed and calm.</li>
    <li> Might work for others but I have not seen a change in my figure yet... at least helps me sleep :)</li>
    <li> Helps to relax an sleep without the post morning hangover.</li>
    <li> well, as many of you know, they have changed the formula from a while back and then the packaging and now from capsule to tablet.  I for one, take this not for weight loss but for the amazing job it does to get rid of my muscle aches/myalgias.  with a side benefit of some energy.  I quit taking this when they changed over to the tablet for it is hard to swallow them verses the capsules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I contacted this seller and she informed me up and down that the picture shoes it is capsules and I defiantly will receive capsules....NOT.....I don&#x27;t think anybody has any older boxes of the capsules, so I got the tablets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh well, I now take it with milk and it is a little easier to swallow.  Just wish that all of these sellers would change the PICTURES!</li>
    <li> I find that it helps me sleep and keeps my  tummy down try it for yourself and you will be pleased</li>
    <li> It was super awesome to get the product as fast as I did. I appreciated so much. thanks again Carlena</li>
    <li> I noticed I slept better but can not see any weight loss effects. I would recommend if you want to sleep.</li>
    <li> pretty good.  I slept better and didn&#x27;t have the same amount of water weight issues.  weight loss?&lt;br /&gt;remains to be seen.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome</li>
    <li> Did not change or do anything for me personally ,but everything isn&#x27;t for everyone ill try something else in the mean time .</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really believe that these would work...BUT...after taking them for a month, I find that I actually sleep better and do no get up to eat during the night, which was a problem for me! The urge is just not there any longer...even when I do wake occasionally!  Great product and price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure with a responsible diet and more exercise this is the perfect thing to boost weight loss. Unfortunately, it did not do miraculous things for me. Word of caution, make sure you do drink the entire glass of water recommended and do not take on a completely empty stomach, caused me to wake up with almost migraine level headaches.</li>
    <li> this supplement is used by my wife and she&#x27;s happy with it.  It helps her control her weight gain  by suppressing appetite and food cravings.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a week now and have found my moods better and my anxiety levels much lower.  So far so good</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t helped with fat burning but it really helps me sleep.</li>
    <li> I am not currently using Relacore but i have in the past and i plan on using this product again. Its no miracle pill but if you have issues with belly fat it really does help to reduce it. If you do nothing to change your diet and excersize then its possible you may see little to no results so if you don&#x27;t plan on changing anything then don&#x27;t waist your time and money. It also does really help enhance your mood and ability to sleep... but the key word is HELP.</li>
    <li> Makes you tired don&#x27;t know if you lose belly fat or not, but you have deep REM sleep for sure</li>
    <li> It was ok.  Didn&#x27;t see any real benefits from using it. I used to use the original relacore &amp; saw results</li>
    <li> In case it&#x27;s helpful:&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I tried this product because of the (listed) ingredients and their potential impact on mood/calmness; that is, regardless of weight loss/cortisol benefits. Since then, I&#x27;ve taken Relacore for several years with brief intermittent breaks. There is no question that for me, (again, not concerned about or critically measuring belly or weight loss), the mood aspect is undeniable and beneficial. There may very well be other products out there with the same (mood) advantage, since it is likely due in large part to the B vitamins, but I&#x27;ve taken straight Bvits independently and not observed the same moderate effect had with Relacore.</li>
    <li> it did nothing for me. I did not lose 1 pound</li>
    <li> We enjoy this product and sleep well with it naturally! A natural path doctor first told us of this and they were right, it works.</li>
    <li> relacore pm made my insomnia worse. I had to stop taking it by the third night. definately will to purchase again</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work as advertized</li>
    <li> I take this to supplement the Relacore Extra Maximum Strength I take each morning. I have had great success with the daytime version of this and just thought I&#x27;d add this to give myself a little more &amp;#34;oomph.&amp;#34;  I cannot say that I have seen an accelerated difference since I started doing this, but as far as a sleep aid, it seems to take the edge off a bit.  This does not come in a bottle as shown.  It comes on blister cards which makes it quite a bit bulkier for storage. I do like the fact that it comes with 96 caplets so I only have to order it once a month as opposed to the daytime version which comes in 72 count bottles.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to assist me with my insomnia and pervious moment of narcolepsy which was believed to be caused by prescription medicines. Surprisingly, it worked well for my anxiety and stress. Due to my serious chronic sleep disorder - I received or had partial and very limited success in this area.  But it has help with my stress/anxiety. Just wished I didn&#x27;t get drowsy or tired  when I have to take it during the day, as I was unable to focus on reading anything thereafter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it&#x27;s worked great for me, I use it in conjuction with the regular Relacore and I lose the extra belly fat and it calms me down at night without any side affects you can&#x27;t buy the Relcore PM in stores anymore so I was glad to fine it here. My only reget on the product is it&#x27;s not as fresh as I&#x27;d like, expiration is next month. Other than that I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing. I actually ended up throwing them away. I was hoping those &amp; the daytime relacore would be a miracle but it was a huge letdown.</li>
    <li> I assume most of the positive reviews are paid for because some companies pay other companies to review and purchase products online.  Or maybe people have just convinced themselves of false results.  I did lose weight after i stopped taking these and so did my wife, brother and cousin who all tried it for 6 months or more.  One result i could understand but 4 of the same makes me sure this product is a waste of money.  I am not extremely obese nor is anyone else i know who tried this product but i doubt that would change these results.</li>
    <li> Relacore pm is great in conjunction with relacore daytime formula. It puts me to sleep. take an hour before your going to bed, and yes you fall alseep with them. its great, and i notice my mood change. Im very relaxed. I would recommend bother relacore and relacore pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: ive been on relacore pm and relacore day time formula for 4 weeks and lost a total of 10lbs. but this is in conjunction to taking both. its worth the money spent. You have to do a diet and exercise... but the pills do work, and this is coming from someone who battles with weight loss. ive been over weight almost my whole adult life, and i have tried every diet pill. relacore seems to work. i hope this helps anyone whos thinking of trying relacore and relacore pm for the first time.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t seem to work.  you are better off eating healthier and exercising.  watch biggest loser and it&#x27;ll inspire you to eat healthier.</li>
    <li> Definitely helps me sleep at night better than many other supplements. Also helps with appetite control.</li>
    <li> They are working for me!1</li>
    <li> It is really to early to comment on this product but I have lost a few pounds.  More to come when I finish off the bottle</li>
    <li> not really sure that they reduce stress, but im still trying. :)</li>
    <li> Taking product as directed by company.  Will let you know the out come once product is finished.  Hope it works.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what is says! A great mood stabilizer, I sleep great, sometimes I have to take one pill if I am going to work long hours. You have to manage your diet and may have to add a stool softer!!&lt;br /&gt;By the summer I will look so cute in my shorts and tees!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Netta-Queen</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s ok. It relieves stress. I wake up in the morning feeling good but I haven&#x27;t noticed any weight loss. haha</li>
