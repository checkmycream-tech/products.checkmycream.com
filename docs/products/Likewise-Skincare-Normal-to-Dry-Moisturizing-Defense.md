      <li>It stays on even during hot weather and it provides excellent coverage and protection for my very sensitive face.</li>
      <li>One of the most important aspects of this particular product for me is that I apply it, get protection and a great moisturizer that my makeup goes on smoothly over.</li>
      <li>It is also a wonderful combination of moisturizer and sun screen as it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy sun screen feeling.  </li>

      <li>Likewise Skincare is fantastic for a combination of moisturizing and sunscreen.</li>

      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>I have dry skin, fair with freckles and just turned 50.</li>
      <li>This is my second purchase of Likewise moisturizing defense and am very happy with how well it moisturizes my dry skin as well as the coverage.  </li>
      <li>Purchased mainly for the high SPF, but it works amazingly well under makeup.</li>
      <li>It is light, yet very hydrating.</li>
      <li>Well worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
      <li>Likewise moisturizer is very gentle and has never once caused this to happen.</li>
      <li>I have never found a moisturizer with a higher zinc content.</li>
      <li>I have used Likewise since the product first came out.  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this skincare product by Jo Ellen at Dr. Pena&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>I am SO lucky to live in Nashville and to be a patient of Skin Solutions.</li>
      <li>The zinc soaks right into the skin without a trace and my skin feels very soft.  </li>
      <li>I started using Likewise after my first visit to Dr Pena&#x27;s office and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It will leave your skin very hydrated.  </li>
      <li>Also of note, the Amazon price is the same as you can buy at my doctor&#x27;s office, so there is no online markup, and it is available for Prime shipping.</li>
      <li>I know that I can feel confident that I am not only protecting my skin from the sun, but also looking clear while doing it.</li>
      <li>I have always needed daily sunscreen and this works far better than applying 2 products; moisturizer then sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Even with this, it goes on lightly and provides an excellent base before applying make-up.</li>
      <li>Having used other well known name brand moisturizers and sun blocks, I was surprised at how much I liked this one.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer does both better than any I have tried previously, OTC or from a dermatologist.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is not thick and goes on evenly.  </li>
      <li>Living in CO, I am in great need of a moisturizer that can handle my already dry skin, in addition to the dry climate and extreme sun exposure at 6500 ft. altitude.</li>
      <li>I also have very sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
      <li>It absorbs completely, helps my makeup go on evenly, and never clogs my pores.</li>
      <li>Originally recommended by my dermatologist, I have used this product for about 4 years as my everyday moisturizer/sunscreen.</li>
      <li>My only wish is that they made an equal whole body product that was water-resistant for summer use.</li>
      <li>I really like that only a pea-size amount is necessary, as it makes the tube last longer.  </li>
      <li>While they recommend a &amp;#34;pea-size&amp;#34; amount, I found I need just a little larger amount for adequate face and neck coverage.</li>
      <li>As the instructions advise, only a small amount is needed for full coverage.</li>
      <li>You only need a small amount and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>I do not use it at night, only am, and a tube lasts about 3-4 months on average, so I think that it is very affordable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> product is really good for skin.  Does not clog pores or create a shinny surface. Makeup goes on smooth and even with moisturizer.  Great delivery.</li>
    <li> Likewise Skincare is fantastic for a combination of moisturizing and sunscreen. It is wonderful to use year round but especially great in the summer because it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin. I started using Likewise after my first visit to Dr Pena&#x27;s office and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My sister introduced me to this product a couple of years ago. Living in CO, I am in great need of a moisturizer that can handle my already dry skin, in addition to the dry climate and extreme sun exposure at 6500 ft. altitude. This moisturizer does both better than any I have tried previously, OTC or from a dermatologist. The zinc oxide provides great all-day protection. It goes on light, absorbs into my skin fully and is not greasy. As the instructions advise, only a small amount is needed for full coverage. Well worth every penny. I will continue to purchase this product for as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> Purchased mainly for the high SPF, but it works amazingly well under makeup. I use every day!!  After only a few weeks, my skin seems to be healthier.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin so I thought this would be a good product for me. However, this felt greasy, not moisturizing. It didn&#x27;t matter how dry or not dry my skin was, it never felt like it was moisturizing for my skin and left a greasy sheen on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product was more a sunscreen than a moisturizer. It has a thick consistency, but with an oily film. It leaves a white cast wherever I apply it and looks like I&#x27;m wearing sunscreen. It feels heavy and clogged up my pores like a regular sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hated using this sunscreen and ended up using it for the body where a white sheen doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.</li>
    <li> I have used Likewise since the product first came out.  After years of having pre-cancer spots removed from my face, my dermatologist recommended this product.  It is perfect for my combination skin type. It is also a wonderful combination of moisturizer and sun screen as it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy sun screen feeling.  I really like that only a pea-size amount is necessary, as it makes the tube last longer.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This line of skincare products was created by my dermatologist. These products WORK. I have used Likewise face moisturizer for approximately two years. I never start the day without it. I have never found a moisturizer with a higher zinc content. Even with this, it goes on lightly and provides an excellent base before applying make-up. My face no longer burns, even when on vacation and spending extra time outdoors. I also have very sensitive skin around my eyes. Other products have actually made this skin feel like it was burning. Likewise moisturizer is very gentle and has never once caused this to happen. Highly recommended!!!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this everyday for about 3 years now.  Keeps my face moisturized under my makeup without making me breakout.  Just a little dab goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Likewise moisturizing defense and am very happy with how well it moisturizes my dry skin as well as the coverage.  The zinc soaks right into the skin without a trace and my skin feels very soft.  I&#x27;ve tried other products with zinc oxide and broad spectrum spf but none that help my dry skin as well.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this skincare product by Jo Ellen at Dr. Pena&#x27;s office. I am SO lucky to live in Nashville and to be a patient of Skin Solutions. After being introduced to this product, I have started buying it for my husband, who is a pilot, and my brother, who is an outside contractor. Each of us using this product is in the sun at maximum rates so having the proper protection is KEY.  Thank you Dr. Pena and her wonderful staff for not only the development of this product, but for educating us about it!  WE LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!  I have used it daily for 3 years and have noticed a dramatic difference with my skin.  This product goes on easy and works well into your skin, it&#x27;s not greasy and feels amazing.  I am 58 and wish I had this back when I was 20!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love likewise skincare! I put this facial moisturizer on daily. It keeps my skin healthy, smooth, and oil/acne free! My make up sits on likewise perfectly and I have used it to replace my primer. I know that I can feel confident that I am not only protecting my skin from the sun, but also looking clear while doing it. I recommend this product to anyone who needs a good sunscreen or moisturizer---best one of the market.</li>
    <li> Originally recommended by my dermatologist, I have used this product for about 4 years as my everyday moisturizer/sunscreen. It absorbs completely, helps my makeup go on evenly, and never clogs my pores. The SPF 50 is excellent. I can use it in the summer without another sunscreen over it. While they recommend a &amp;#34;pea-size&amp;#34; amount, I found I need just a little larger amount for adequate face and neck coverage. I have dry skin, fair with freckles and just turned 50. I have always needed daily sunscreen and this works far better than applying 2 products; moisturizer then sunscreen. It is never oily. I do not use it at night, only am, and a tube lasts about 3-4 months on average, so I think that it is very affordable. My only wish is that they made an equal whole body product that was water-resistant for summer use. Also of note, the Amazon price is the same as you can buy at my doctor&#x27;s office, so there is no online markup, and it is available for Prime shipping. Love it!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the BEST! I started using Likewise after my dermatologist recommended it for my very dry skin (especially in winter.) It is light, yet very hydrating. I ran out recently and tried to buy something similar from the drugstore, but nothing even comes close! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen.  You only need a small amount and it absorbs quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film like other sunscreens I have used in the past.  This sunscreen is also odorless and has great moisturizer.  Once to try it you will never go back to any other sunscreen brand.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist created this formula with SPF 50 sunscreen.  I have used this for about 9 months now and it is excellent!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use Likewise everyday and I like the coverage. It is not thick and goes on evenly.  It stays on even during hot weather and it provides excellent coverage and protection for my very sensitive face.</li>
    <li> I use this all summer long.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I began using this based on a recommendation from my dermatologist. Having used other well known name brand moisturizers and sun blocks, I was surprised at how much I liked this one. One of the most important aspects of this particular product for me is that I apply it, get protection and a great moisturizer that my makeup goes on smoothly over. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer!  I use it daily without fail.  Best purchase ever...</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product.  Great moisturizer with the best sunscreen protection combined in one.  My dermatologist recommended this product.  Helps to keep younger looking skin.  Only a small amount is needed to moisturize and protect all day.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this product is really good and will continue to use ...</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It only takes a pea size amount as stated.  It will leave your skin very hydrated.  Highly recommended.</li>
