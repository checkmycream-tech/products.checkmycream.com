      <li>Love that the ingredients are good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an OK product.  </li>
      <li>I have curly hair and love MOP</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 years and love it.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve found better organic hair care products now.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>After I submit this review. :-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>I thought this product was fine.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t keep your hair looking flat-iron-smooth, but it does an amazing job keeping hair healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>No annoying scent.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my hands, is light in my hair.</li>
      <li>I have medium length, fairly curly hair, and needed a product to put in and preserve curls while looking natural.</li>
      <li>I just started using this product, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>Lastly, I love that it has a light, clean smell that&#x27;s pleasant but unisex and not in competition with other hair product smells.</li>
      <li>It has kept my hair pretty healthy</li>
      <li>It also has a mild clean smell that doesn&#x27;t over-power like Moroccan oil.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad product.  </li>
      <li>it is a great, light conditioner for everyday use.</li>
      <li>And the price is so reasonable!!</li>
      <li>This one is not too heavy and does a great job keeping my curls together.  </li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>The old formula helped with tangles, kept my hair looking healthy, defined, and kept frizz at bay.</li>
      <li>Besides being more natural than most hair products, this leave-in conditioner is nice because it adds volume and definition to your hairstyle without making your hair stiff.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re right, stranger.  </li>
      <li>I use a generous amount on my hair right after shampoo</li>
      <li>It holds the shape of the curls and dries beautifully: just the right amount of weight to tame the curls and protect from frizzing while leaving the hair feeling soft.</li>
      <li>This does exactly that.</li>
      <li>It does nothing positive for my hair</li>
      <li>I was excited to find it here, and my hair has become softer, silkier, more manageable and healthier looking after just a few uses.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.</li>
      <li>It works very well for me.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really control</li>
      <li>This stuff works very well.</li>
      <li>For thinner hair, this formula is probably better because it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down as much</li>
      <li>But I also need to avoid fly-away hair, which happens when fine hair gets dry.  </li>
      <li>Actually, after I apply it to my hair, it absorbs right into my hands and makes them soft, too, which is rare with a hair product</li>
      <li>Cannot live without this product!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and weighs down my hair without making it too &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;, which is exactly what Im looking for.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This formula is much thinner than the old version.</li>
      <li>– normally you have to wash them off.</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s still a fine product.</li>
      <li>I do dye my hair, typically light, sparse highlights in very dark hair (bi-annual basis).</li>
      <li>With this product, if I don&#x27;t use heat, my hair is really soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of different leave in conditioners for my very curly hair.  </li>
      <li>My local retailer stopped carrying MOP products and, after having to go without, my hair became much drier and damaged in a matter of weeks.</li>
      <li>This leave-in conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>My 3 year old daughter has naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>It just sinks in, which is exactly what leave-in conditioner should do.</li>
      <li>benn using this product for several years - can&#x27;t live without it</li>
      <li>I have big curly hair and this stuff defines my curls while keeping them soft and natural looking.</li>
      <li>Works really well in softening and hydrating my thin, long hair&lt;br /&gt;I would have prefer a more pure version without fragrance and other non-organic chemicals</li>
      <li>I have thick, coarse, frizz-prone hair and this is the only leave-in conditioner that leaves my hair looking and feeling healthy.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly (3B) hair, thin but full.</li>
      <li>I do not typically have dry hair, but its&#x27;s winter here.</li>

<li> I have naturally curly (3B) hair, thin but full.</li>
<li> I do not typically have dry hair, but its&#x27;s winter here.</li>
<li> I have very fine thin straight hair, so I can&#x27;t have a heavy product weighing it down.  </li>
<li> I leave my hair until it is completely dry and then fluff it up or blow dry it straight.</li>
<li> A hard to find item that works very well for my thinning hair.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that the product itself isn&#x27;t very thick so sometimes more comes out of the tube than you might want at one time.</li>
<li> so it lasts forever; one tube lasts about 6 months for long hair.  </li>
<li> I used to use this all the time for my very curly, thick hair.</li>
<li> For those with curly color treated hair that ends to be dry, MOP leave in</li>
<li> It also makes my dry hair shine.</li>
<li> My hair isn&#x27;t dry</li>
<li> She wished the person who left it would have thrown it away rather than subject someone else to it.  </li>
<li> I use a tiny bit of this on the ends of my hair and any places that seem to need a little extra moisture, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s moisturizing my hair or not - hair still seems very dry.</li>
<li> As usual, you have to be careful about not touching your hair, since its just a leave-in and not a mousse or gel, but it is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
<li> I left this on the gym counter hoping someone else would take it and enjoy it, and the next day heard a woman talking about how she tried some conditioner left on the counter, and she hated it.</li>
<li> I would definitely recommend this product for people looking to moisturize and tame their hair without weighing it down.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a looser consistency than other product I&#x27;ve used, and it leaves a residue on my hands that I feel compelled to wash off after use, requiring soap.&lt;br</li>
<li> I notice the difference when if I use other conditioners.</li>
<li> and I have since tossed it out in favor of other products.</li>
<li> The tube I received recently was very wet and the flow was hard to regulate.</li>
<li> My hair feels like silk but isn&#x27;t weighted down.  </li>
<li> My hair is slightly curly and frizzy.</li>
<li> You can avoid weigh-down by watering it down a little in your hands.</li>
<li> Does not leave my hair greasy or heavy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is great.  My hair feels like silk but isn&#x27;t weighted down.  I have short hair and only need a dime size portion.  Wonderful product.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect for my curly hair, which would otherwise frizz and fro-out. It also allows me to style my hair without leaving a sticky or hard feel of product. [[ASIN:B0016FVJQC MOP Leave- In Conditioner Unisex, 6.76 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I hear about this item sooner? I am glad the internet had great reviews on this product. Will I buy this product again? After I submit this review. :-)</li>
    <li> This is everything I&#x27;d hoped it would be. I switched over from It&#x27;s a 10, which is a tough act to follow. I was skeptical of a cream or gel because I&#x27;m really bad at evenly distributing anything except a spray in my hair, but this spreads like a dream. It isn&#x27;t the least bit oily or sticky. It just sinks in, which is exactly what leave-in conditioner should do. Actually, after I apply it to my hair, it absorbs right into my hands and makes them soft, too, which is rare with a hair product – normally you have to wash them off. Lastly, I love that it has a light, clean smell that&#x27;s pleasant but unisex and not in competition with other hair product smells. I hope MOP doesn&#x27;t change a thing about this product.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old daughter has naturally curly hair and I put the MOP leave in conditioner in her hair after each wash.  Works great on her hair and it has organic ingredients.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a really excellent leave-in conditioner.  Does a great job of softening hair without leaving any residue.  Doesn&#x27;t require a lot to cover, so it last longer than you think it would.</li>
    <li> Love it! Locks in moisture! I have curly/wavy hair and it does wonders!^^</li>
    <li> I thought this product was fine. It smells good but is just okay...i&#x27;ve found better organic hair care products now.</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;m in danger of falling in the shower I need a leave-in product like this. It also makes my dry hair shine. The tube I received recently was very wet and the flow was hard to regulate. Other than that it&#x27;s still a fine product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years.  Every now and then I try something else, but I always come back to this MOP product.  I have very fine thin straight hair, so I can&#x27;t have a heavy product weighing it down.  But I also need to avoid fly-away hair, which happens when fine hair gets dry.  I use a tiny bit of this on the ends of my hair and any places that seem to need a little extra moisture, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this, now I can&#x27;t find it locally.  My hair isn&#x27;t dry but I wash it every day after I work out.  With this product, if I don&#x27;t use heat, my hair is really soft and shiny.  Still great with heat, just not quite as shiny</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 years and love it. It was recommended to me for tangles from my stylist at the time. It has kept my hair pretty healthy and I get foil highlights and have had chemical straighteners through the years as well.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, frizz-prone hair and this is the only leave-in conditioner that leaves my hair looking and feeling healthy. I used the product for 7 years and only got my hair cut once every 6-9 months because I never got split-ends. My local retailer stopped carrying MOP products and, after having to go without, my hair became much drier and damaged in a matter of weeks. I was excited to find it here, and my hair has become softer, silkier, more manageable and healthier looking after just a few uses. I love this stuff and hope I am never without it again! It won&#x27;t keep your hair looking flat-iron-smooth, but it does an amazing job keeping hair healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> Works really well in softening and hydrating my thin, long hair&lt;br /&gt;I would have prefer a more pure version without fragrance and other non-organic chemicals</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shines and manageable.  I notice the difference when if I use other conditioners. It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK product.  It&#x27;s a looser consistency than other product I&#x27;ve used, and it leaves a residue on my hands that I feel compelled to wash off after use, requiring soap.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad product.  It&#x27;s light and weighs down my hair without making it too &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;, which is exactly what Im looking for.</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well. I have big curly hair and this stuff defines my curls while keeping them soft and natural looking. No crunchy, no sticky, no flaky, no nothing. My only complaint is that the product itself isn&#x27;t very thick so sometimes more comes out of the tube than you might want at one time.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and love MOP leave-in conditioner because it tames my hair without making it crunchy or hard (like mousse can).  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for about two years and it still works well.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product, but so far so good. it is a great, light conditioner for everyday use. Does not leave my hair greasy or heavy. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Besides being more natural than most hair products, this leave-in conditioner is nice because it adds volume and definition to your hairstyle without making your hair stiff.  I can testify that it works well with curly hair.</li>
    <li> A hard to find item that works very well for my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 10 years.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my hands, is light in my hair.</li>
    <li> This item is perfect for my needs. I have medium length, fairly curly hair, and needed a product to put in and preserve curls while looking natural. This does exactly that. As usual, you have to be careful about not touching your hair, since its just a leave-in and not a mousse or gel, but it is exactly what i was looking for. Frizz no more!</li>
    <li> This leave in does make your hair softer.  It is ultra concentrated so it lasts forever; one tube lasts about 6 months for long hair.  You can avoid weigh-down by watering it down a little in your hands.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It&#x27;s lightweight yet moisturizes my hair well. Works great under styling products or alone. Love that the ingredients are good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really big on buying organic products. This is not it. Was disappointed to find they don&#x27;t list the ingredients on the product listing. Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s moisturizing my hair or not - hair still seems very dry. Very thin texture. Doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell. Lightweight. Doesn&#x27;t really control frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I should mention hair type. I have naturally curly (3B) hair, thin but full. I do dye my hair, typically light, sparse highlights in very dark hair (bi-annual basis). I do not typically have dry hair, but its&#x27;s winter here. Just didn&#x27;t do anything noticable.</li>
    <li> benn using this product for several years - can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great, Smells amazing and it&#x27;s Organic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 years. I have naturally curly hair &amp; this is very moisturizing without being greasy, sticky or heavy!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my hair for the last 5 years. My hair is slightly curly and frizzy. I use a generous amount on my hair right after shampoo and I comb it in. I leave my hair until it is completely dry and then fluff it up or blow dry it straight. It works very well for me.</li>
    <li> Good all around leave in conditioner for my wavy hair. I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this. No annoying scent.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in product for curly hair. It holds the shape of the curls and dries beautifully: just the right amount of weight to tame the curls and protect from frizzing while leaving the hair feeling soft. It also has a mild clean smell that doesn&#x27;t over-power like Moroccan oil.  And the price is so reasonable!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Cannot live without this product!  Have been using it for over 5 years and very time I have taken a break or used something else my hair feels dry and awful.  For those with curly color treated hair that ends to be dry, MOP leave in is the absolute best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of different leave in conditioners for my very curly hair.  This one is not too heavy and does a great job keeping my curls together.  The scent is fresh and not overpowering.  I would definitely recommend this product for people looking to moisturize and tame their hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Very effective product!!!</li>
    <li> I used to use this all the time for my very curly, thick hair. The old formula helped with tangles, kept my hair looking healthy, defined, and kept frizz at bay. This formula is much thinner than the old version. It does nothing positive for my hair and I have since tossed it out in favor of other products. For thinner hair, this formula is probably better because it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down as much but I needed the extra conditioning and extra product weight.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! This did NOTHING for my hair.  I left this on the gym counter hoping someone else would take it and enjoy it, and the next day heard a woman talking about how she tried some conditioner left on the counter, and she hated it. She wished the person who left it would have thrown it away rather than subject someone else to it.  You&#x27;re right, stranger.  Dully noted.</li>
    <li> Ingredients are not organic. Seller should update the photo of the product.</li>
