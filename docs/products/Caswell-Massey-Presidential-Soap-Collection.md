      <li>I have been buying them for more than 20 years.  </li>
      <li>And really, more than that.</li>
      <li>Caswell-Massey soaps do not come cheap, but the patient shopper can look for sales here or at the manufacturer&#x27;s own site.  </li>
      <li>Caswell Massey makes an outstanding product.  </li>
      <li>we love the smell of all 3.  </li>
      <li>Lovely packaging, historical interest, wonderful fragrance.</li>
      <li>George Washington&#x27;s favorite was Number 6</li>
      <li>Bought this for years for a man friend I love.  </li>
      <li>but until then I can not buy any more of this companies soaps.</li>
      <li>I absolutely, positively, love this set.  </li>
      <li>Were shipped very quickly, products were excellent, about $6.00 more than getting them directly from caswell Massey, but let me tell you I originally ordered these soaps two weeks before this company and they were never shipped out by caswell Massey, so my advise</li>
      <li>I love the scents, but, some may think it&#x27;s too strong.  </li>
      <li>all this happened to me, so I ordered from this company and couldn&#x27;t be happier, they did everything with flying colors, shipped within 24 hours, perfect soaps, relative was very happy with items, will order again if needed, will never again order from caswell Massey, they offered me a 25 percent discount for the mixup, not good enough to go through that again when you have a good company as this company that does the job right the first time around!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Reduce the level of scent/perfume in each soap and they might be fine,</li>
      <li>I am a HUGE fan of this soap.</li>
      <li>The scents are powerful but mostly musky and woody.  </li>
      <li>Caswell-Massey makes really smooth, rich, and protective soaps.  </li>
      <li>Truly a unique product which draws the interest of all our guests as to what it is and where we got it.</li>
      <li>get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
      <li>That is, I felt that it performed its role in getting me clean during my shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is a special sophistication that you feel after you shower with these soaps.  </li>
      <li>Note that all these soaps are full, hard-milled 5.8 ounce bars, not samplers.  </li>
      <li>These soaps are true luxury.</li>
      <li>The variety pack is a good alternative and is a standard gift under the Christmas tree.  </li>
      <li>But once I reminded her I don&#x27;t complain about her $80 hair cut&#x27;s compared to my $9.99 ones, she quickly backed away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This gift arrived as advertised and quickly.  </li>
      <li>First of all this is a Caswell-Massey product which means it will be made of the finest ingredients available.</li>
      <li>mostly if I feel I can contribute something new.</li>
      <li>I do suggest that the bars of soap be identified more clearly.  </li>
      <li>Really worth the splurge for soap.</li>
      <li>I hope someone may find this information useful.</li>
      <li>Other than that they felt good and lathered well</li>
      <li>and I can smell it on me right now.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are also very large so you def.</li>
      <li>with B.O. on the way out, Hillary as a strong contender (BLAUAUAUAUauaaauuuuuauuuuu) and Donald Trump being taken seriously, i think i have a really good chance.</li>
      <li>Republican&amp;#34; of the 1950s, shows up in Almond Cold Cream -- smooth, effective, and widely popular.  </li>
      <li>I used the brown one for the first time this morning</li>
      <li>I bought these for my fiancé so he could have many smelling soap that would also last him a while.</li>
      <li>All three are great and last a long time.  </li>
      <li>Pretty box for gift giving.</li>
      <li>Cute present!</li>
      <li>However, I personally find the scents overwhelming as does my husband.</li>
      <li>They lather nicely and a single bar  lasts much longer than soap you buy at the grocery.</li>
      <li>Such a cool gift, for yourself or someone else!</li>
      <li>The scents are really strong, especially with the Number 6 soap (it&#x27;s the orange bar you see in the picture).  </li>
      <li>I think reviews about products such as this are somewhat subjective, and I&#x27;m not an expert on fine quality soap.</li>
      <li>Please spend a little extra now for weeks and weeks of great cleaning pleasure.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t worry though, because, you really won&#x27;t smell like a woman.  </li>
      <li>Always appreciated..</li>
      <li>decided on 3 stars because it functions admirably in its role of soap and because I believe the smell is a very subjective aspect.</li>
      <li>months in fact, and they lather better than any other soaps I have tried or reviewed.</li>
      <li>I wish I could describe the odor in other terms, to be more descriptive.</li>
      <li>These bars are solid and hold up alot better than your standard store bought soaps.</li>
      <li>The youthful and adventuresome Democratic John Kennedy, who followed Eisenhower as President, is here as Jockey Club, an upscale scent, assertive but not too sweet, reminiscent of summer New England and sailing clubs.  </li>
      <li>George Washington, who had no political party, is represented by Number Six, based on the kind of bay rhum-inflected soaps Americans enjoyed back in the late Eigteenth Century.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>All 3 are long lasting after a shower on the person and in your home. :)</li>
      <li>and I have to say I feel pretty manly using soaps that former presidents used!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only on the first bar.  </li>
      <li>The other reviewer was right, the soaps are very very strong in terms of scent and even the almond cold cream soap was too strong.</li>
      <li>Clearly quality and heritage soaps.</li>
      <li>Smells like the 50&#x27;s old man&#x27;s soaps.</li>
      <li>This was a gift for my 40+ yr old son who likes this product.  </li>
      <li>Classy gift without overdoing it.  </li>
      <li>It is unusual to get three such distinguised soaps in one giftworthy box.  </li>
      <li>this soap is a product you have to try at least once in your life, it will be the cleanest you ever felt, these soap bars are huge and last an incredably long time, this is worth every penny</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ok...these soaps are STRONG!  I mean...it&#x27;s one thing to have scented soap...but...even in the box these things made our kitchen smell.  I used the brown one for the first time this morning and I can smell it on me right now.  It&#x27;s almost as if I&#x27;m wearing parfume.  My other half sent me a text message and asked that we dispose of them &#x27;cause they were burning his eyes in the bathroom.  I thought about returning them but I did open one of them and that wouldn&#x27;t be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please know...they are gorgeous soaps and they come in a very nice box.  I&#x27;m sure they work just great too.  They just smell too strong!  If the soaps were diled down 95% they would be awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also very large so you def. get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> First of all this is a Caswell-Massey product which means it will be made of the finest ingredients available. Great packaging and comes with a Biography of each of the Three Presidents, and their favorite soaps. All smell great and each one is unique just like the Greenbriar Soap. Why should a man buy this soap? Simple. They last a very long time...months in fact, and they lather better than any other soaps I have tried or reviewed. Please spend a little extra now for weeks and weeks of great cleaning pleasure.</li>
    <li> A great product and fast service!</li>
    <li> I exclaim the benefits of using this soap. Caswell-Massey makes really smooth, rich, and protective soaps.  All three are great and last a long time.  I have a water softener so I cannot guarantee it will last as long for you as it has for me. I am a big man, but, you only need to rub the bar on your washcloth a few times and it lathers up like a beast.  I think it&#x27;s cheaper using these soaps in the long run than continually buying soaps from the supermarket. The scents are really strong, especially with the Number 6 soap (it&#x27;s the orange bar you see in the picture).  I love the scents, but, some may think it&#x27;s too strong.  Don&#x27;t worry though, because, you really won&#x27;t smell like a woman.  The scents are powerful but mostly musky and woody.  Number 6 has a sweetness to it but it doesn&#x27;t smell feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All summed up, I would recommend these soaps.  You can&#x27;t go wrong and even US Presidents have bathed with the same soaps.  George Washington&#x27;s favorite was Number 6, Jockey was loved by John F. Kennedy Jr, and Eisenhower coveted Almond Cold Cream. (it says so in a packing slip contained in the box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just take heed - if you have dry skin, this probably isn&#x27;t the soap for you.  It lathers well but I do find this soap drying when traveling as the hotels I stay in don&#x27;t have water softeners.  Just an FYI. If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizing soap, try anything from Nubian Heritage soaps, especially their coconut papaya soap.</li>
    <li> This gift arrived as advertised and quickly.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> BEST FEELING SOAP.  TREAT YOURSELF</li>
    <li> My father received this as a Christmas gift and once I smelled the soaps I ordered them immediately. These bars are solid and hold up alot better than your standard store bought soaps. Though they are more expensive, the quality and the fragrances are well woth the extra few dollars.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this product from a brick and mortar, however, they closed.  I purchase it for gifts often.</li>
    <li> The soaps were phenomenal! He loved them. The after shave was a disappointment. Too strong  of a scent!</li>
    <li> Lovely packaging, historical interest, wonderful fragrance. Comes with parchment-like paper explaining the significance.  I think I found a great gift idea</li>
    <li> This product  met my expectations!  I ordered on June 29 and it was delivered July 3.  Great service.  I do suggest that the bars of soap be identified more clearly.  It is hard to distinguish which bar is which</li>
    <li> Really worth the splurge for soap.</li>
    <li> The other reviewer was right, the soaps are very very strong in terms of scent and even the almond cold cream soap was too strong. They have me a headache after every shower which my previous bar soap never did. Other than that they felt good and lathered well but because of the headaches, I&#x27;ve had to send them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reduce the level of scent/perfume in each soap and they might be fine, but until then I can not buy any more of this companies soaps.</li>
    <li> Hey - did you ever wonder what George Washington smelled like?  He smelled like me, after a shower with this soap.  Come get a piece of history.  Own this soap now.  No complaints regarding its effectiveness - it seems to do the job that soap does, 100%.</li>
    <li> Love these soaps.  Great gift for under $30&#x27;</li>
    <li> I think reviews about products such as this are somewhat subjective, and I&#x27;m not an expert on fine quality soap. I don&#x27;t review often; mostly if I feel I can contribute something new. At the time of this writing this product had 12 reviews, all 5 stars. It is part of the reason I purchased this product with no other information. I realize 12 reviews is not very many, but it is soap right (how bad can it be)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me start the actual review by saying it functioned well for me. That is, I felt that it performed its role in getting me clean during my shower. And really, more than that. There always seems to be discussion of whether or not soap leaves a residue behind -- some tangible effect on the skin. I&#x27;m oily. I don&#x27;t want moisturizers and prefer that there is no lingering effect on my skin from the soap. In this regard, this product was to my liking. But again, that is subjective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I decided to write a review, however, is that the soap has an unmistakable odor I associate with \\&quot;inexpensive hotel room\\&quot; soap. I mean, it also has a unique fragrance, but it is overpowered by the hotel room soap smell. And I smelled it all day long on my body. I find it unpleasant. And since it does fill the room with its odor (as others have mentioned), I will likely just throw all three bars away. I wish I could describe the odor in other terms, to be more descriptive. I cannot think of another place I&#x27;ve encountered that smell, though I recognized it the moment I opened the shipping box. That realization you have on a trip when you forgot to pack soap and are going to have to shower with the soap provided by the budget inn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided on 3 stars because it functions admirably in its role of soap and because I believe the smell is a very subjective aspect. I hope someone may find this information useful.</li>
    <li> Products were excellent! Were shipped very quickly, products were excellent, about $6.00 more than getting them directly from caswell Massey, but let me tell you I originally ordered these soaps two weeks before this company and they were never shipped out by caswell Massey, so my advise I would spend the extra money and order from this company!  Caswell Massey never answers your phone calls, emails, cancels orders once you do order the items, it is a total headache, all this happened to me, so I ordered from this company and couldn&#x27;t be happier, they did everything with flying colors, shipped within 24 hours, perfect soaps, relative was very happy with items, will order again if needed, will never again order from caswell Massey, they offered me a 25 percent discount for the mixup, not good enough to go through that again when you have a good company as this company that does the job right the first time around!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Clearly quality and heritage soaps. However, I personally find the scents overwhelming as does my husband.</li>
    <li> Holiday gift to myself.  I&#x27;m only on the first bar.  I use it for my Saturday night shower because I&#x27;m rarely in public on Sunday so don&#x27;t run the risk of razzing for wearing perfume.  I&#x27;ll likely reorder.</li>
    <li> Bought this for years for a man friend I love.  He loves these, so I love them too.</li>
    <li> Recommend trying this soap, I purchased from Amazon for all memebers of my family for Christmas, they all love it!</li>
    <li> Caswell-Massey is a constant in our house.  My husband uses nothing else.  He used to only buy Tricorn, but we have had trouble finding it in recent years.  The variety pack is a good alternative and is a standard gift under the Christmas tree.  I also like the story behind each fragrance.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 40+ yr old son who likes this product.  Always appreciated.. I have given this gift previously.</li>
    <li> I absolutely, positively, love this set.  My wife was not happy I spent the money on 3 bars of soap.  But once I reminded her I don&#x27;t complain about her $80 hair cut&#x27;s compared to my $9.99 ones, she quickly backed away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a special sophistication that you feel after you shower with these soaps.  I can certainly understand why our great fathers of this country used these.  They do leave your skin a little dry but nothing that a touch of lotion can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> Caswell-Massey the best of the best. Used to have to go far and wide to get their products. Now point click done. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
    <li> These are wonderful soaps.  These scents are appropriate for both men and women.  I have been buying them for more than 20 years.  Caswell Massey makes an outstanding product.  They lather nicely and a single bar  lasts much longer than soap you buy at the grocery.</li>
    <li> We would recommend these soaps to everyone.  Truly a unique product which draws the interest of all our guests as to what it is and where we got it.</li>
    <li> this soap is a product you have to try at least once in your life, it will be the cleanest you ever felt, these soap bars are huge and last an incredably long time, this is worth every penny</li>
    <li> we love the smell of all 3.  JFKs is the best. All 3 are long lasting after a shower on the person and in your home. :)</li>
    <li> I bought these for my fiancé so he could have many smelling soap that would also last him a while. I thought it was neat that they were scents used by former presidents, and he thought so too. Cute present!</li>
    <li> My eye doctor saved the sight in my eye after the retina detached.  I gave him these presidential soaps as a token thank you gift.  He seemed very  delighted with it.  Caswell Massey has been  around since the beginning of our nation.  This is a collection of three soaps that were the favorites of three different presidents..  Classy gift without overdoing it.  Makes a flawless impression.</li>
    <li> these came just in time. i plan on making a bid for the presidency this term. with B.O. on the way out, Hillary as a strong contender (BLAUAUAUAUauaaauuuuuauuuuu) and Donald Trump being taken seriously, i think i have a really good chance.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had though it was a way to get the Tricorn fragrance, but alas, it isn&#x27;t one of the three.  However, these hard-milled soaps last forever -- frugality disguised as self-indulgence.</li>
    <li> Got this for my brother in law - each soap has a very nice and distinct fragrance.  Pretty box for gift giving.</li>
    <li> Best price and fast shipment. Wish they had more of a selection. Would buy from again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Who says politicians can&#x27;t get along?  Here are three soaps inside of one box that represent the best (smelling) aspects of America.  George Washington, who had no political party, is represented by Number Six, based on the kind of bay rhum-inflected soaps Americans enjoyed back in the late Eigteenth Century.  Dwight Eisenhower, &amp;#34;Mr. Republican&amp;#34; of the 1950s, shows up in Almond Cold Cream -- smooth, effective, and widely popular.  The youthful and adventuresome Democratic John Kennedy, who followed Eisenhower as President, is here as Jockey Club, an upscale scent, assertive but not too sweet, reminiscent of summer New England and sailing clubs.  It is unusual to get three such distinguised soaps in one giftworthy box.  Note that all these soaps are full, hard-milled 5.8 ounce bars, not samplers.  Caswell-Massey soaps do not come cheap, but the patient shopper can look for sales here or at the manufacturer&#x27;s own site.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this soap collection for himself.  They are very strong and not to my liking.  Smells like the 50&#x27;s old man&#x27;s soaps.</li>
    <li> These classic soaps are perfect.  Split them up among the family.  I&#x27;ve loved Caswell Massey quality for years, never disappointed.  These soaps are true luxury.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of this soap. I was lucky to find it in a department store on clearance once, and every since then have been addicted to it! I refuse to use any other soap product. The scents are amazing.... and I have to say I feel pretty manly using soaps that former presidents used! Such a cool gift, for yourself or someone else!</li>
