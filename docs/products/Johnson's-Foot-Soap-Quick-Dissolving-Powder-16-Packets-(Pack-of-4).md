      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and delivers the results it promises!     </li>

      <li>So here&#x27;s another great review for this over 100 year old product!</li>
      <li>After years of neglecting the dry skin on my heels (too busy raising kids)... I am happy to say this product is GREAT!!</li>
      <li>I was so glad to find this on Amazon--it is no longer available in stores by me.  </li>
      <li>You will feel the effect of this old but very effective potion with in seconds.</li>
      <li>I like the original it is better.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong before putting it in the water.</li>
      <li>Nothing has worked nearly as quickly or as well as this product!</li>
      <li>This powder really makes my sore feet feel better!</li>
      <li>Last time I could not find it, and I was so happy that it is available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Amazon sells it in bulk and its a great savings over the same amount, if you can find it, than in a store.</li>
      <li>When I bought it, free shipping was also included.    </li>
      <li>Just bought this huge amount of it because I liked it so much.</li>
      <li>No longer being sold in the local stores I tried and I am so glad I could find it online and save a good penny buying in bulk.  </li>
      <li>I bought a lot of this soap and will be back to buy more because I will be sharing with my loved ones.</li>
      <li>I was excited to see that it was available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I borrowed one from my mother-in-law years ago but never perceived any significant benefit so didn&#x27;t purchase one.</li>
      <li>Always the very best foot soak; my dead skin wipes (or exfoliates) right off.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product and hard to get.</li>
      <li>This soap is great and still the same from when it first came out.  </li>
      <li>Seriously, words cannot describe the wonderful relaxing feeling.</li>
      <li>After a long day, she brought out two clean basins filled with warm water and this product.</li>
      <li>I was ecstatic to find it on Amazon and loved that I was able to purchase such a huge supply for such a reasonable price with free shipping!</li>
      <li>I have tried lots of fancy foot products, but not one of them softened callouses or soothed aching feet like this tried and true old favorite.</li>
      <li>I have battled dry skin for many years and have tried many foot soaking products and lotions.</li>
      <li>My dad and his dad used this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Removes dead skin and soften toe nails, great stuff if you maintain your foot health.</li>
      <li>A quick rinse under the shower before drying them off and everything was clean, soft and sweet smelling.</li>
      <li>I first tried it when I was at a friend&#x27;s cabin.</li>
      <li>A real bargain here!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I love soaking my feet in a regular basin (no need for a massage spa with Johnson&#x27;s -</li>
      <li>Once weekly I use this compound to cleanse, clean and vitalize my old feet.</li>
      <li>As an older person, the time required to soak and seek comfort is well worth the effort.</li>
      <li>It makes your feet feel refreshed and super soft.</li>
      <li>It feels good to soak in after a long day and seems to restore some softness to the skin, reducing further cracking.</li>
      <li>I certainly will buy again.</li>
      <li>It has helped him because it is very soothing to his feet</li>
      <li>Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap has really helped BOTH of us.  </li>
      <li>I have tendonitis and it really helps when I use this to soak my feet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Whether you are elderly or not, Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap is very soothing to irritated skin, in either a foot bath or a whole-body bathtub.  </li>
      <li>Put this in your footbath and you will realize great relief to aching or tired feet.</li>
      <li>It works great on tired feet.</li>
      <li>After much on-line research, I found Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap.</li>
      <li>but my feet really feel rejuvenated after usage.</li>
      <li>Shipped well &amp; fast.</li>
      <li>A bath makes your whole body feel relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>even when the skin was not broken...</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves this product.</li>
      <li>but it really works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And I keep doing so, because it&#x27;s simply the best - a proven, foot remedy for sore and tired or otherwise exceedingly stressed feet.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soothing and it softens the skin so that you can remove dry skin easily.</li>
      <li>And it has helped me by keeping his body odor down, since we discovered that most of his body odor came from his feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>particular</li>
      <li>in all this item is truly a foot care classic.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it in my foot spa and it works just fine as long as you don&#x27;t turn any \\&quot;jets\\&quot; on as it will start bubbling and make quite a mess!  It is relaxing and the product does what it&#x27;s suppose to do....my feet feel refreshed after a little time in the spa with Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap.</li>
    <li> The champagne of soaks, no wonder this stuff is still around, nothing can compare to how GREAT your tootsies feel after the J.F.S. TREAT-ment!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about product claims, but the product actually softens your feet. After about thirty minutes, my dry heals were starting to slough their callouses. I wish I had found this product sooner!</li>
    <li> I stand on my feet for 10-12 hours at work. Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soup works just as you would want. You will feel the effect of this old but very effective potion with in seconds. Draw up a shallow tub of warm water, dump in the packet and put your tired feet in. Be advised the powder will make you sneeze if breathed in. A bath makes your whole body feel relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy in bulk because once you try it, you will not want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I have battled dry skin for many years and have tried many foot soaking products and lotions. Nothing has worked nearly as quickly or as well as this product! I first tried it when I was at a friend&#x27;s cabin. After a long day, she brought out two clean basins filled with warm water and this product. We relaxed and soaked our feet for approximately half an hour, then dried them, and applied lotion before retiring for the evening. I was AMAZED how soft my feet were the next day and for days afterward! Given the difficulty I had always had at keeping my skin soft, use of this product made them softer than they had been in years! I was disappointed when I arrived home and visited all the stores in my area who might carry such a product, only to find that it wasn&#x27;t available. I was ecstatic to find it on Amazon and loved that I was able to purchase such a huge supply for such a reasonable price with free shipping! I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and delivers the results it promises!     One additional note: I had looked at many foot spa products over the years and contemplated buying various bubbling vibrating spas in which to soak my tired feet. I borrowed one from my mother-in-law years ago but never perceived any significant benefit so didn&#x27;t purchase one. Since using this product, I found that you don&#x27;t need a fancy foot spa. I purchased two 12 quart plastic dish tubs, one for my daughter, and one for me. When we use the product, I put down a plush bath towel folded in half for each of us, place the basins of warm water mixed with Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap on top of each towel, then we sit down on the sofa and relax, placing our feet in our respective basins. We visit with each other while we soak our feet and find the time to be very relaxing. When done soaking our feet, we slide the basin off the towel, and then use the towel to carefully dry our feet. We find that we are quite happy with this process and this product! It&#x27;s an inexpensive way to pamper ourselves and take care of our feet!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, great price!  [[ASIN:B000NSS1J6 Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap, Economy Size, 8 packets [8 oz (226 g)], (Pack of 4)]]</li>
    <li> Johnsons Foot Soap is hard to find in stores but so worth it. No matter how badly your feet hurt, burn or smell, this stuff will fix you right up. You can not only soak your feet but a couple packets in the bath will help you soak away those sore muscles. Amazon sells it in bulk and its a great savings over the same amount, if you can find it, than in a store.</li>
    <li> So far, this has been the best product I have used for painful cracked heals.  It feels good to soak in after a long day and seems to restore some softness to the skin, reducing further cracking.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Soothes tired and aching feet.  I use it, my teenage daughter uses it.  We used to be able to purchase at the pharmacy but they no longer carry it.  I was excited to see that it was available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> After years of neglecting the dry skin on my heels (too busy raising kids)... I am happy to say this product is GREAT!! This review is being submitted after only one use and what a difference! I am cconfident that my feet will be back to normal in no time. I will continue to use Johnsons Foot Soap as it is relaxing and also smells good. Also like the way my hall closet smells from storing unopened packets. I bought a lot of this soap and will be back to buy more because I will be sharing with my loved ones.</li>
    <li> I tried Johnson&#x27;s Foot soap after the incisions from my foot surgery healed enough to soak.  I had many callouses on my foot, and this soap softened them and helped me remove the bad skin from my foot very easily.  However, if you use it in a bubbling/massaging foot bath, DO NOT use the entire packet.  Start out with only 1 tsp., then add a tiny bit at a time until it&#x27;s right.  Otherwise, bubbles will be everywhere!</li>
    <li> ORDERED A CASE OF JOHNSONS fOOT SOAP AND WITHIN FOUR DAYS IT ARRIVED AS ADVERTIZED. GREAT SELLER.</li>
    <li> My wife is a manager of a commercial kitchen and is on her feet for up to 12 hours a day for several days throughout any particular week when her schedule gets very busy. I looked for something that would help soothe her feet after work as my hand massages do help, but I thought there might be something that could help her feet in a better way. After much on-line research, I found Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap. After reading reviews from a bunch of different websites, I ordered the Economy Size package (best value) from Amazon.com and hoped for the best. My wife loved it! And whenever her tootsies are aching, she soaks her feet for about 20 minutes and can&#x27;t believe just how great her feet feel after the soaking. So here&#x27;s another great review for this over 100 year old product!</li>
    <li> If you bike and have sore feet, or just enjoy a good foot soak, this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for soaking feet. I had a difficult time finding Johnson&#x27;s foot sooap in stores, went to Amazon and there it was so much cheaper than in store.</li>
    <li> Due to some health problems, the skin on my feet &amp; legs has gotten very dry. I used to use this when I worked retail in high school and was on my feet all day. Nothing works as well as Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap to soften and soothe my feet.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my wife. She used to buy from a major retailer which quit caring it. She absolutely loves this product. She says that her feet feel so much better after use. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product that I use all the time.    The price was less than half of what I usually pay.    When I bought it, free shipping was also included.    I certainly will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find product in my area. Not only is it good for sore, and or calloused feet, it is wonderful in the bath to ease away the aches and pains of the day. Great product; great price!!!</li>
    <li> tried the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; ... this is the one that softens the tough places and leaves my feet years younger</li>
    <li> Johnson&#x27;s foot soap has been around for years. Unfortunately, where we live, a lot of people wonder what we are talking about when we ask for it. Now, we know we can get it at Amazon. Put this in your footbath and you will realize great relief to aching or tired feet.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and hard to get. A real bargain here! Thanks! I got these for an elderly neighbor who couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Always the very best foot soak; my dead skin wipes (or exfoliates) right off.  Amazing!!  Will keep buying from this seller every time I run out.  The best price for an item that is not always easy to find.</li>
    <li> Soothes feet well as others have stated before!!!  For the price it&#x27;s one of the best foot soaps out there!</li>
    <li> I love this foot soap. Just bought this huge amount of it because I liked it so much. I threw out my electric foot bath and just use a plain old tub of water. It makes your feet feel refreshed and super soft.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find johnson&#x27;s foot soak on amazon.  I was so disappointed when Walmart stopped carrying it. This product is magical.  It softens your feet like no other product. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, I wish I could find it locally but will have to accept I can only find it online.</li>
    <li> definitely using this a lot</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s soothing and it softens the skin so that you can remove dry skin easily. I have been using it for years--I always have a supply. Last time I could not find it, and I was so happy that it is available on Amazon. Long live Amazon and may Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap always be available.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this foot soap for years but haven&#x27;t been able to find it for a while.  there is nothing out there that i&#x27;ve found that even comes close - so was very happy to find it available on amazon.  simple but it really works.</li>
    <li> excellent happy camper</li>
    <li> The Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap, Economy Size, 8 packets [8 oz (226 g)], (Pack of 4)  is a great product my mother has used this for decades... I also use them. They have recently become hard to find here in MA, I used to get at CVS but they replaced with a CVS brand. I like the original it is better. You can use just half a pack and get the same results. It really does make your feet soft and relaxed. Here is a Suggestion... After you soak, dry your feet and use Miracle Foot Cream, put a plastic baggy on and a pair of socks, ( do this while watching TV or when you are in bed) Your feet will change over night.. ) The price was great also</li>
    <li> My parents used this and now my grandson is using it in his bath. It was hard to find in the stores. So glad I found this on web.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and highly recommend it to anyone with tired , sore and achy feet</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this on Amazon--it is no longer available in stores by me.  I am 92 yr old and I was not ready to try a different brand or product since this one works so well</li>
    <li> Got a foot bath for Christmas and my brother recommended this product. It works great on tired feet. I have tendonitis and it really helps when I use this to soak my feet. Would highly recommend this for anyone with tired feet or a foot bath.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of there&#x27;s chemical/metallic not-so-pleasant smell to it that lingers wherever you store the boxes. Makes you wonder about the ingredients. When you open the packet, the powder content does spread in the air and it made me and my husband, who was 10 feet away, sneeze. Once you get everything mixed in, it does make you feet feel soft. Its just not worth it for me, I&#x27;d rather find a product that when I can soak my feet, I actually feel relaxed.</li>
    <li> This product use to be sold at Walmart and Walgreens. I used it then.  The soap worked well but is no longer sold at these stores.</li>
    <li> My elderly dad has very limited mobility, preventing routine shower or tub use, and his feet are always swollen now from the diabetes and the limited mobility.  Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap has really helped BOTH of us.  It has helped him because it is very soothing to his feet (whereas, salt baths seemed to aggravate his foot sensitivity for some reason... even when the skin was not broken... maybe from stimulating the circulation).  And it has helped me by keeping his body odor down, since we discovered that most of his body odor came from his feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are elderly or not, Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap is very soothing to irritated skin, in either a foot bath or a whole-body bathtub.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For some reason this item is very hard to find in the stores. Not only was I able to find it here, but the price is half of that I would have paid anywhere else. Great deal!!!</li>
    <li> This soap is great and still the same from when it first came out.  My family loves it.  It&#x27;s like medicine!</li>
    <li> LOVE JOHNSON&#x27;S FOOT SOAP.  IT SOFTEN CALLUSES AND CORN.  I USE IT OFTEN. MAKES FEET FEEL HEAVENLY. I RECOMMEND  THIS.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this 4-pack of Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap countless times over the years here on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I keep doing so, because it&#x27;s simply the best - a proven, foot remedy for sore and tired or otherwise exceedingly stressed feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A blissful and relaxing weekly foot bath with Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap is bound to improve your overall sense of well-being and state of health even if you have no significant foot problems worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also just the thing to soak your feet in for about 20-30 minutes to help soften them before attending to whatever else may be causing those poor dogs of yours to bark incessantly. Alternatively, it can even be used as a relaxing full-body bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In particular it helps prepare hard fungal nails for further treatment either with one of the available antifungal remedies such as Kerasal by improving nail penetration (see my review) or a more hands-on approach with an electric pedicure tool such as the Home Pedicure PediNova III - Electric Manicure Kit (see my review) for especially thick and problematic nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this item is truly a foot care classic. Try it soon; you and your feet be glad you did!</li>
    <li> This powder really makes my sore feet feel better! But I have to keep the packets in the garage double bagged. The smell is strong before putting it in the water.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of walking, and standing. I love soaking my feet in a regular basin (no need for a massage spa with Johnson&#x27;s - although that probably only adds to the delightful feeling!) after a hard day on my feet. Ahhhh, it&#x27;s an amazing relaxing feeling to soak in this amazing concoction. Seriously, words cannot describe the wonderful relaxing feeling. Please, if you are on your feet and they ache, do yourself ONE FAVOR: GET YOURSELF SOME JOHNSON&#x27;S FOOT SOAP. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!!!</li>
    <li> My dad and his dad used this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Removes dead skin and soften toe nails, great stuff if you maintain your foot health.</li>
    <li> I have used this foot &#x27;SOAK&#x27; since I was a little girl(50 years now). My mother used to let me soak my tootsies in a basin of warm water with Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap while she soaked hers. I have tried lots of fancy foot products, but not one of them softened callouses or soothed aching feet like this tried and true old favorite. I used to put it in the bathwater with a few toys for my boys, when they were little after a long summer day of hard play. A quick rinse under the shower before drying them off and everything was clean, soft and sweet smelling. I can&#x27;t remember a time when I didn&#x27;t have a box of Johnson&#x27;s in the linen closet.</li>
    <li> I can remember my grandmother using this when I was a child so I know it has been around for a long time. I am on my feet several hours a day during the work week and by mid-week my feet begin to swell and ache. This foot soap helps to relieve some of the swelling and aching. I buy the economy size packets because I like the water to come up past my ankles so the bigger packets are needed for that much water.&lt;br /&gt;I fill a basin according to the directions and sit with my feet/ankles soaking in the evening until the water cools off. I usually soak right before bed time so that my feet are elevated afterwards to help keep the swelling down. I might add that this soak makes my feet feel amazingly soft. There is a slight scent but nothing strong or pungent.</li>
    <li> Shipped well &amp; fast. the product of course is THE BEST foot soap one can find. No longer being sold in the local stores I tried and I am so glad I could find it online and save a good penny buying in bulk.  There is nothing more refreshing than Johnson&#x27;s Foot soap. Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is a distant second and the others I&#x27;ve tried are worthless to me.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know how well this product works because I had to dump it out of my house because of the horrific smell. I felt like I could taste the chemicals from it in my mouth. The very worst stuff that I have ever smelled!</li>
    <li> As an older person, the time required to soak and seek comfort is well worth the effort. Once weekly I use this compound to cleanse, clean and vitalize my old feet. Wouldn&#x27;t it have been wonderful to have this mixture during basic training 62 years ago. Don&#x27;t know how it does the job but my feet really feel rejuvenated after usage.</li>
    <li> great product  for dried old feet helps reduce cracking makes cutting toe nails easy. I would recommend to anyone having trouble with their feet.</li>
