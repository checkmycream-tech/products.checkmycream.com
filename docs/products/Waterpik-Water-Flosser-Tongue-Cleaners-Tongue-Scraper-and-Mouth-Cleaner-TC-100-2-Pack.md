      <li>My manual tongue scraper works much better.  </li>
      <li>Much better.</li>
      <li>Better cleaning with a manual brush and some tooth</li>
      <li>I would suggest that you would be better off just using your toothbrush with toothpaste on it after you have done your teeth,  </li>
      <li>Really works as a great finishing touch in the morning.</li>
      <li>they are OK would i buy them again no</li>

      <li>My tongue is clean and my breath is fresh!!!</li>
      <li>Nice seller and quick shipping but a bit overpriced for what you get.</li>
      <li>Quick Shipment, just as described!</li>
      <li>however the scraper is too smooth.  </li>
      <li>Still looking for replacements to fit.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s just a smooth surface.  </li>
      <li>Great tongue scraper when waterpik is not on I only turn the unit on to rinse the scraper out</li>
      <li>I did not think these tongue cleaners would fit but ordered anyway.</li>
      <li>Great to have this outside to get in.</li>
      <li>The water-pick, while not a proven DIRECT replacement for flossing, is a far more pleasant way to get kids interested in keeping good care of their teeth.  </li>
      <li>Takes a bit of use to get familiar with the correct way to use them though.  </li>
      <li>My tongue has never felt so clean.</li>
      <li>We like these very much they clean way back in your throat without gagging you and of course cleans your tongue great</li>
      <li>Good accessory but not as necessary as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>It works better and for efficiently than a toothbrush and much easier on your tongue to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll use this but not for the purpose of getting my tongue clean, just cause it fun to use, I think.</li>
      <li>12 year-old is worried more &amp; more about her image, and her breath has been an issue for a long time.  </li>
      <li>You have to use products at your own risk because products work differently for some people.</li>
      <li>This really helps clean your tongue</li>
      <li>Just sprays water on the tongue, doesn&#x27;t clean very well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit my old Waterpik.</li>
      <li>My whole family loves these tongue cleaners!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like my tongue is that much cleaner after using.</li>
      <li>That being said it seemed to work very well</li>
      <li>This item works very well in &amp;#34;scraping&amp;#34; and washing away debris that collects on your tongue.</li>
      <li>I dont really see the purpose in this attachement.  </li>
      <li>It does clean your tongue but there are challenges like if you open your mouth you will be showering and have that gagging feeling</li>
      <li>I can only compare it to using a spoon to clean your tongue.  </li>
      <li>I use them to clean my tongue, but then have the chage back to my normal tip to do my gums.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>a little better than a tongue cleaner.</li>
      <li>I am new and you have to master it.  </li>
      <li>Before I ordered these I compared the flosser stems in the Waterpik Classic Professional Flosser</li>
      <li>Also, the head is too small to really get in there and clean.</li>
      <li>I had an old one that kept hurting my tongue.</li>
      <li>Improves my breath considerably.</li>
      <li>But, no other choice if I want to use my Water Pik.</li>
      <li>Other than that little problem, I am satisfied with the units and their price.</li>
      <li>There are no rough edges, bristles or anything on this</li>
      <li>I hope that my reviews really helps out because I read other reviews and that will give me a sense on whether to purchase or not.  </li>
      <li>For a few weeks, my kids used the water pik and then started flossing first, then washing it away with the water-pik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sometimes just little things like this outdoor remote are so Cool.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it, and it definitely uses mechanical action of water to blast away the bacteria &amp; food on your tongue, and I find it far less hurtful then brushing my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Sometimes just little things like this outdoor remote are so Cool.</li>

<li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything but direct spray down as a non-scrubbing &amp;#34;soft waterfall.&amp;#34;</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed far less of an issue, so</li>
<li> They work well, but for my older unit I had to cut the stem down a little to get it to seat properly.</li>
<li> The water pressure is not very strong on your tongue and you can reach the same goal by using one of the attachements that come with the water pik.</li>
<li> The water jet is too weak, even if I use the setting #10, and I don&#x27;t feel it does much cleaning.</li>
<li> I expected the pressure to be a lot stronger.</li>
<li> the design is poor in that you cannot really scrape the tongue&#x27;s surface.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like watch TV with a remote control versus not having one.</li>
<li> If you want to massage your tongue or get really wet, well then buy it,  </li>
<li> It has got to be better than nothing, but still, I was disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> It WILL NOT clean your tongue.  </li>
<li> This product takes a little getting used to, after all it is scraping your tongue.</li>
<li> These items are just a joke and a waste of money.</li>
<li> I wouldnt waste my money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll keep it for when I buy a new base unit.</li>
<li> I like the water feature, but not really good with scraping the tongue.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately they did not fit.</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed with the low pressure that the tongue cleaner attachment has (even at the highest level it is very weak).</li>
<li> These were the wrong size for my Waterpik Flosser.</li>
<li> This is a blatant mis leading product,  If you buy it, well then your just not listening to the reviews,</li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>
<li> Useless.  </li>
<li> i am not impressed with this.</li>
<li> and she SWEARS they have made her bad breath go away.  </li>
<li> What a worthless piece of plastic.  </li>

    <li> i thought this would be a great product, but the water and scraper don&#x27;t work well together.</li>
    <li> An absolute waste of my money.  I would suggest that you would be better off just using your toothbrush with toothpaste on it after you have done your teeth,  run your brush over your tongue, then swish with water and be done with it.  These items are just a joke and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> A nice attachment for the WaterPik Cleaning System.  Takes a bit of use to get familiar with the correct way to use them though.  When used in conjunction with a regular toothbrush it does make cleaning the tongue and especially the back of the tongue easier.  With regular use, you may find your taste changing a bit since bacterial buildup gets cleaned and flushed away.</li>
    <li> my manual scraper works better. the design is poor in that you cannot really scrape the tongue&#x27;s surface. i am not impressed with this.</li>
    <li> I love  this tongue  cleaner work as great</li>
    <li> product arrived on the agreed date and as advertised.</li>
    <li> We have used these cleaners for years, and like them. Arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> I had an old one that kept hurting my tongue.</li>
    <li> The seller delivered the product at the start of the Delivery Windows and should get 5 stars!  The reason for the 2 star rating is the product itself.  The bristled tongue brush I have does a much better job, compared to this attachment.</li>
    <li> We like these very much they clean way back in your throat without gagging you and of course cleans your tongue great</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Save money and buy a regular tongue scraper.</li>
    <li> My tongue has never felt so clean. Improves my breath considerably.</li>
    <li> It just squirt water on your tongue and I didn&#x27;t feel that it cleaned it well. It is nothing like my steel tongue scraper.</li>
    <li> Nice seller and quick shipping but a bit overpriced for what you get. But, no other choice if I want to use my Water Pik.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed with the low pressure that the tongue cleaner attachment has (even at the highest level it is very weak). I expected the pressure to be a lot stronger. I don&#x27;t feel like my tongue is that much cleaner after using. It is probably a better idea to just get a non-waterpik tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> works great with the water pick</li>
    <li> This is a waterpik accessories and again don&#x27;t wear clothes.  It does clean your tongue but there are challenges like if you open your mouth you will be showering and have that gagging feeling but when you close your mouth your mouth will fill up with water to the point to decision swallow or spit.  I mix my water with mouth wash w/ enamel and I have a separate enamel care, you can&#x27;t swallow those products.  I am still trying to get use to it.  I am new and you have to master it.  Nevertheless it does get the job done.  I hope that my reviews really helps out because I read other reviews and that will give me a sense on whether to purchase or not.  You have to use products at your own risk because products work differently for some people.</li>
    <li> Really works as a great finishing touch in the morning.</li>
    <li> What a worthless piece of plastic.  If you want to massage your tongue or get really wet, well then buy it,  It WILL NOT clean your tongue.  This is a blatant mis leading product,  If you buy it, well then your just not listening to the reviews,</li>
    <li> Product came as described, but not the best for efficiency.  I like the water feature, but not really good with scraping the tongue.  It&#x27;s just okay...</li>
    <li> Good accessory but not as necessary as I thought it would be. I prefer to just use the Sonic brush on the tongue.</li>
    <li> I dont really see the purpose in this attachement.  When I use it I dont feel that this is even doing anything.  The water pressure is not very strong on your tongue and you can reach the same goal by using one of the attachements that come with the water pik. I wouldnt waste my money.</li>
    <li> Great tongue scraper when waterpik is not on I only turn the unit on to rinse the scraper out</li>
    <li> This product takes a little getting used to, after all it is scraping your tongue. That being said it seemed to work very well and I am extremely pleased with it and the WaterPik 660 I bought.</li>
    <li> Worked great thanks barb</li>
    <li> I had hoped that this would replace my tongue scraper but no.  It really is a good thing to use after the tongue scraper, so all is not lost.</li>
    <li> They work well, but for my older unit I had to cut the stem down a little to get it to seat properly. Other than that little problem, I am satisfied with the units and their price.</li>
    <li> Its just water and then you scrape your tongue. Better cleaning with a manual brush and some tooth past.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this but not for the purpose of getting my tongue clean, just cause it fun to use, I think.</li>
    <li> Received as promised. Before I ordered these I compared the flosser stems in the Waterpik Classic Professional Flosser I recently purchased. I did not think these tongue cleaners would fit but ordered anyway. Unfortunately they did not fit. Still looking for replacements to fit.</li>
    <li> This is just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;&#x27; but a good &#x27;ol toothbrush works better.</li>
    <li> The water-pick, while not a proven DIRECT replacement for flossing, is a far more pleasant way to get kids interested in keeping good care of their teeth.  For a few weeks, my kids used the water pik and then started flossing first, then washing it away with the water-pik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 12 year-old is worried more &amp; more about her image, and her breath has been an issue for a long time.  So on a whim, I bought these for her and she SWEARS they have made her bad breath go away.  I&#x27;ve noticed far less of an issue, so I think she&#x27;s correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it, and it definitely uses mechanical action of water to blast away the bacteria &amp; food on your tongue, and I find it far less hurtful then brushing my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I think these work, and the mechanics of them seem to be valid.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they did not come with my Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Useless.  Use your toothbrush.  Much better.</li>
    <li> Just sprays water on the tongue, doesn&#x27;t clean very well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this is. It doesn&#x27;t fit my old Waterpik. I&#x27;ll keep it for when I buy a new base unit.</li>
    <li> I use them to clean my tongue, but then have the chage back to my normal tip to do my gums.</li>
    <li> This is one of best iteams I have ever used</li>
    <li> Most people forget about their tongue when brushing their teeth. This item works very well in &amp;#34;scraping&amp;#34; and washing away debris that collects on your tongue. It fits my Waterpik WP-900 device with no problems.</li>
    <li> they are OK would i buy them again no</li>
    <li> I like the idea of including a scraper with the water however the scraper is too smooth.  My manual tongue scraper works much better.  Also, the head is too small to really get in there and clean.</li>
    <li> This product I will advertise to anyone!! My tongue is clean and my breath is fresh!!! I love it! BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> Great to scrub your tongue with!</li>
    <li> Wonderful addition for the Waterpik.  This really helps clean your tongue and I highly recommend this.  It works better and for efficiently than a toothbrush and much easier on your tongue to use.</li>
    <li> Quick Shipment, just as described! TY</li>
    <li> The water jet is too weak, even if I use the setting #10, and I don&#x27;t feel it does much cleaning.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use them, as it causes gag reaction in patient.</li>
    <li> works good simple,durable design</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything but direct spray down as a non-scrubbing &amp;#34;soft waterfall.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Last one died and this took its place without a hitch. Great to have this outside to get in. Sometimes just little things like this outdoor remote are so Cool. It&#x27;s like watch TV with a remote control versus not having one.</li>
    <li> a little better than a tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> My whole family loves these tongue cleaners! We are going to buying them again soon!</li>
    <li> Love how it cleans and freshes my breath with just water.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  There are no rough edges, bristles or anything on this, it&#x27;s just a smooth surface.  I can only compare it to using a spoon to clean your tongue.  It has got to be better than nothing, but still, I was disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> These were the wrong size for my Waterpik Flosser. Be sure to put your Model number in so you don&#x27;t make this error like me.</li>
    <li> Excellent. No complaints</li>
