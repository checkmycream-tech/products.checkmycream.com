<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Due to winter, and the now changing of the seasons, my lips had been dry, and cracking, so I was in desperate need of a lip balm that could do the job, and didn&#x27;t have all the yucky chemicals in it.  These La Luna Naturals fit the bill.  I have loved them since the first time it touched my desperate lips.  Each one has a truly lovely scent (my daughter always says, &amp;#34;I want to eat it!&amp;#34; whenever I/she uses it), and it does a fabulous job of moisturizing.  It stays on nicely, and doesn&#x27;t have a yucky taste.  On top of doing a great job of bringing my lips back to life, I love that it is totally organic, natural, with no chemicals, and gluten free.  It&#x27;s just the icing on the cake!  I did receive this for review purposes, but all opinions are entirely my own.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my 2 year old granddaughter who is always wanting my chapstick. Perfect as they contain no additives and she can put as much on as she wants.</li>
    <li> I love it. Taste great and feels amazing on my lips.</li>
    <li> Works quite well, loved the pepermint scented one and the vanilla. The Asian pear one had an awful smell unfortunately...</li>
    <li> As A Member Of Tomoson I Was Selected To Sample And Review La Lune Naturals USDA Certified Organic Lip Balm In Exchange For My Honest Opinion.  All Opinions Stated In This Blog Are Strictly My Own&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I Opened The First Tube Which Was Raspberry, I Immediately Put It To My Nose To See How Strong The Scent Would Be! It Wasn&#x27;t A Overwhemling Scent But Time Kinda Hard To Smell Almost Like A Freashly Ripe Red Raspberry A Light Scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Lips Feels So Soft! This Winter Weather Has Caused Major Dryness In My Skin,  And So I Love Products That Include Beeswax And Natural Oils, Since The Moisture Lasts Longer. I Could Feel The Protective Layers On My Lips Long After Applying The Balm! It’s Not Very Thick, As Sometimes Beeswax Balms Can Be. I Felt It To Be Very Light Weight On My Lips And Smooth. It Goes On Very Easily And Smoothly. It Dosen&#x27;t Feel Waxy Or Greasy Because There Is NO Wax Or Petroleum In It To Make It Feel That Way. I&#x27;ve Had It On For About An Hour And Even Drank Some Tea In Between And I Can Still Tell That Its On My Lips. It Did Not Interfere With My Tea, Which Is A Good Thing Because I Don&#x27;t Like Anything To Come Between Me And My Tea. It Makes My Lips Feel Smoother And More Moisturized And I Love That Its Natural So I Know I&#x27;m Not Putting Any Junk On My Lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lalune Lip Balms Are Certified Organic And Contain No GMO&#x27;s, Petroleum Or Parabens. They Do However Contain Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Coconut Oil, Vitamin E, Organic Rosemary Extract, Organic Calendula And Natural Organic Flavors. They Come In A Cardboard Recyclable Box Which Contains Four Flavors Of Lip Balm Raspberry, Asian Pear, Peppermint, And Vanilla Bean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Can Not Say Anything Negative About This Lip Balm. Its Natural, It Doesn&#x27;t Really Have A Tastes To It, It Goes On Easy, Not Greasy Or Waxy And Its Organic. Also It Has A Great Price To For Four Of Them At That!&lt;br /&gt;I Wish I Had Something Bad To Say To Make This Review More Balanced But I Can&#x27;t. Its A Great Product And I Think Anyone Would Love It If Givin A Try At Least Once. Great For Babies, And Adults Too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If You Would Like To Pick Up Your Very Own Lalune Naturals Organic Lip Balm Follow The Link Below To Get Your @ Amazon.com http://www.amazon.com/dp/b00sxbc5uqalanced But I Can&#x27;t.

    <li> I bought these for myself.  i cant believe how long they last, easy to apply, non-greasy or heavy feeling.  the scents are delightful and not over powering in any way.  Good to have variety.  I bought a 4 pack for a friend and she doesn&#x27;t know it yet.  I couldn&#x27;t resist, had a major price reduction and could not pass up the opportunity to pass on a great product as a surprise gift.  That&#x27;s what friends do.</li>
    <li> I love this four pack of Chapstick. I put it on once and my lips stay moisturizers all day so I don&#x27;t need to keep reapplying. The scents and flavors are great. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and long lasting. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Great lip balms! They hydrate well, go on smoothly, and it feels great knowing everything is organic and I&#x27;m not harming my body with any chemicals!</li>
    <li> I love these!! Natural, smooth. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I am a lip balm JUNKIE! Seriously if you looked around all my stashes I probably have 30 or more that are all in active use. That doesn’t count any my kids or hubby has! I’ve been trying more of the natural types so I was pretty interested in this pack of four when I was offered them for free* to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are made with natural products such as beeswax and coconut oil and come in four different types all of which smell great but do not have an actual taste to them.  It came with a peppermint, raspberry, Asian pear and vanilla bean. My husband quickly took the Asian pear and vanilla bean because he knows peppermint is my favorite of anything and he just wasn’t interested in the raspberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall we both find these very moisturizing and nice to use. They glide on smoothly, leaving our lips moisturized but not waxy or greasy feeling. They do not dry either of our lips out with the exception of the raspberry. I did not mark this down any stars however because my family members can use it just fine and I’ve had reactions to other brands such as EOS that were raspberry flavored so I think it’s a personal allergy to something in the raspberry flavored items I use just on my lips. It’s not a super bad reaction, but my lips start to feel more dried out and get chapped and flaky, like a lip rash, no swelling. It’s not an instant reaction, but one that builds up using it multiple times throughout the day or over a span of a few days. Again I’ve had no reaction to any of the others and likewise my family doesn’t have any problems with the raspberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes that these go on without the shiny gloss that some products have and that they are not heavily scented so other than a quick whiff when putting it on he’s not going to smell of unmanly scents. He also likes that they are not actually flavored taste wise, he hates my lip balms and glosses that have sweet tastes to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely something I will be purchasing again, I’ll just give the raspberry to my hubby or one of my kids who all regularly use lip balms as well and do not have any reactions while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting these lip balms for free this is both mine and my husband’s 100% honest opinion.purchasing again, I’ll just give the raspberry to my hubby or one of my kids who all regularly use lip balms as well and do not have any reactions while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting these lip balms for free this is both mine and my husband’s 100% honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I have nothing negative to say about these lip balms!&lt;br /&gt;I love each of the scents &amp; they are so nourishing &amp; soothing to my lips. One day I used it on my cuticles &amp; was impressed .&lt;br /&gt;This company puts out a consistently good product.&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered the coconut oil! Can&#x27;t wait to try it!&lt;br /&gt;BTW I ordered these on my own. They are not review products :)</li>
    <li> These are the nicest lip &amp;#34;balms&amp;#34; I have ever used. They really stay on, they really do moisten your lips, they also protect your lips from sun damage. I love the ingredients and feel comfortable putting this product on my skin. The &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; are not really flavors as much as they are scents, except the peppermint which has a tingly feel, but I don&#x27;t like flavored lip stuff so I am very happy that the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; are really just scents. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These smell incredible.  I really enjoy the Asian Pear scent!  I think they&#x27;re a little smaller than the regular store-bought lip balms, but they&#x27;re really worth it.</li>
    <li> Kept two for myself and gave the other two flavors to my son and daughter-in-law! They love it as well :) Will keep by my bedside to use instead of Vaseline.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm.  Good feel, great at what it&#x27;s for (moisturizing), and stays on well!</li>
    <li> These 4 lip balms come packed in a cute cardboard box and are 4 different flavors. I think the Asian Pear is my favorite.  They are delightful to see--very smooth and soft.  All organic and natural products.</li>
    <li> These lip balms are amazing!  Almost immediately you feel the relief of dry, chapped lips.  Very soothing and delightfully light scents that add to the calming of the discomfort.  Most definitely recommend to all who are prone to dry lips.  Even if you&#x27;re not, this balm makes your mouth and area of your face feel just great.  Wonderful product, thanks very much.</li>
    <li> With so many drug store type lip balms having bad ratings on EWG.org, I&#x27;m very pleased to find these.  I&#x27;ve never liked balms that drag when you&#x27;re putting them on.  These are smooth and go on easily but are not too soft.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is so perfect for this transitioning weather! The ingredients include beeswax, sunflower oil, coconut oil, vitamin E, rosemary extract, and calendula. ALL organic and cruelty free! It’s such an exciting blend of nutrients, and it shows in just how smooth this lip balm feels when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips felt so soft! This winter weather has caused major dryness in my skin, and so I love products that include beeswax and natural oils, since the moisture lasts longer. I could feel the protective layer on my lips long after applying the balm! It’s not very thick, as sometimes beeswax balms can be. I found that it felt almost delicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 4 scents included in the pack: raspberry, vanilla bean, peppermint, and Asian pair. They are deliciously flavored, without smelling artificial. The raspberry is my favorite, with its balance of a fruity and soft scent combination. Your lips are about as close to your nose as you can get, so I’m sure attractive smells are as important to you as they are to me when it comes to a good balm. My least favorite scent is the peppermint. This isn’t because it’s not pleasant, I just don’t tend to prefer minty scented products. La Luna’s lip balm scents are pronounced enough to entice, but not so overwhelming that you find yourself turned off from its potency. I always love when a product finds just the perfect balance in its scent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a very straightforward lip balm that moisterizes and adds a protective barrier. I definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To read my full review, check it out here:&lt;br /&gt;https://candidreviewmom.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/la-lune-naturals-organic-lip-balm/#more-63&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product free from the company for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Excellent products.  Very satisfied.  Arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever love the smell and being organic is the best of all, there is so many bad things in conventional lip balm, love it</li>
    <li> Received my lip balms today (I live in Guam).  The packaging is as others described ... nice box, simple.  I chose Asian Pear to start and so far I am very pleased.  Feels different from my previous lip balm.  Smell and flavor is not overpowering, don&#x27;t even notice it.  And, I love that these lip balms are organic!!!  So far I am a happy customer.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are really nice balms. Silky smooth and great scents/flavors. My toddlers like to use balms, so the safe organic ingredients make me happy! (I even threw out all my other sticks! These are so much better than anything I had)</li>
    <li> I have struggled with dry lips for my entire life, and I&#x27;m always trying new chapsticks. Rarely am I completely satisfied. But this brand works extremely well, and they&#x27;ve got a great feel and a light, natural scent. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> As a self-confessed lip balm junkie, this 4-pack from La Lune has quickly become a favorite. I keep one in my purse, at my desk at work, bedside...basically anywhere I am, I am not without lip balm. The flavors are nice, not chemical tasting whatsoever, and I love that these are no petroleum based. I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Not greasy, smells well and discrete way. Very good either for the snow or the beach.</li>
    <li> you get exactly what it is described. good value. full disclosure, they give me $2 off coupon. but if it&#x27;s not a good product, i won&#x27;t even need to coupon since i am going back to buy it again. great pdts.</li>
    <li> I just received the lip balm for my two year old twins.  I LOVE THEM!  It is smooth and penetrates the skin rather than &amp;#34;laying&amp;#34; on the lips.  There are very few ingredients and the smells are pleasant and not overpowering at all. The price point is fair as you would pay this or even more for a name brand chapstick/lip balm in a drug store.  I will absolutely purchase this again and look forward to trying other products by you.</li>
    <li> All 4 flavors are great.  My daughters took away one each.  Lips feel soft and the product doesn&#x27;t taste weird.  Keeping them handy to use often!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is very light in flavor and the feeling on the lips.  However, it lubricates the lips very well.</li>
    <li> Love the lip balm... super love this company!</li>
    <li> It makes my lips feel so soft and smooth. It&#x27;s organic so a big plus for me.I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I frequently bite my lips which sometimes results in cracked, bloody, painful lips. When I received these in the mail, I tried the peppermint flavor first and was pleasantly surprised at how smooth they glide on and at the cold, soothing feeling the peppermint leaves behind! Within a couple of days, my lips were almost back to normal and so soft! Something that no other lip balm has managed to do so fast! You get four lip balms (Peppermint, Asian Pear, Raspberry, and Vanilla Bean) and they smell downright edible, and not overwhelmingly powerful. I also like that these lip balms are cruelty free, organic, non-GMO, non-toxic, gluten free, and are not greasy. I received these at a promotional discount but I would definitely pay full normal price for these!  Ingredients according to the individual lip balm labels are:  Peppermint: Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Essential Oil of Peppermint, Vitamin E, Organic Rosemary Extract, Organic Calendula.  Asian Pear: Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Pear Flavor, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Watermelon Flavor, Organic Spearmint Essential Oil, Vitamin E, Organic Rosemary Extract, Organic Calendula.  Raspberry: Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Raspberry Flavor, Vitamin E, Organic Rosemary Extract, Organic Calendula.  Vanilla Bean: Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Vanilla Flavor, Vitamin E, Organic Rosemary Extract, Organic Calendula.</li>
    <li> very good. not greasy, my lips are moisturized and no rough, dry lips any more. The good thing is it is organic!</li>
    <li> These lip balms are better than any other ones in the market, my lips feel hydrated, they don&#x27;t break as often as before, and they do not become dependent on these lip balms. They have a great smell and they don&#x27;t taste oily like other brands. I love these and would recommend them to anyone with really dry and breaking lips, these is a great product and a set of 4 for this price and quality, I&#x27;d definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Very hydrating. Very happy with results.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been looking for a good chapstick.....and we&#x27;ve found it!!! All four flavors are awesome!</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife because she was looking for natural product and she loves it. it is a bit more expensive but if my wife is happy then i am happy too. i will definitely recommend this and planning to buy again when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is an update to earlier review. still a great product and my wife loves it, so i will definitely buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This is the best balm I&#x27;ve ever used. Love the ingredients and how smooth and creamy the texture is! I would definitely recommend this product! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s smooth, conditions and doesn&#x27;t tastes good compared to other lip balms. No I don&#x27;t eat it but those other lip Balmer know what I mean</li>
    <li> Love these! So smooth &amp; hydrating! They smell good enough to eat! Love that they are organic so I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I wanted something to use on my lips that is more natural &amp; without sunscreen chemicals. I am very happy with La Lune Lip Balm. It has an interesting scent that I find calming. My husband likes it as well.</li>
    <li> Very soft and smooth like velvet!!</li>
    <li> I use lip balm constantly in this dry harsh climate. I have tried several, and had a favorite that had to be ordered from a special vendor, until I bought this one. I love this. It is soft and goes on easily, I like the fact it is organic, and the different choices available.</li>
    <li> These seem like a healthier choice over 7-11 or gas station lip balm.  Smell and taste good, if not a bit girly.  Unfortunately, application does not last as long as gas station lip balm I am used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to prob reorder these as I use up / lose them.</li>
    <li> Got these a day sooner than expected. We LOVE lip balm at our house and have had a hard time finding organic and GMO free ones. These were perfect! Loved the scents (vanilla is my favorite), they glide on smooth and last a long time. No weird residue or waxy feeling on my lips. We will definitely be stocking up on these! Great job La Lune Naturals! Another great organic product we can enjoy :)</li>
    <li> I got this product at a reduced price. I could not be happier with it. I love that it uses all organic ingredients. Since you inevitably end up ingesting any lip balm, I like that this is organic oils and ingredients. Also very moisturing</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for in a natural, organic lip balm!! Absolutely no chemicals! All four lip balms have a great scent and last for hours! I will definitely be buying these again!</li>
    <li> Smooth, not waxy. Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I love these organic lip balms. They glide on smoothly and they do not leave that usual chemical feeling on your lips. It is nice getting a package of four different flavors, all of which are subtle and not too overwhelming. These are a great safe product for my family to use.</li>
    <li> Great product and flavors. I love these lip balms. They last forever and are so good for your lips.</li>
    <li> I just received these lip balms and they are great. It&#x27;s like a spa treatment for your lips. Really makes them soft and the flavors are excellent. I cannot tolerate peppermint due to allergies so I gave that lip balm to my husband and he loves it too. Thank you for one of the best lip balms I have tried. I will update after I have been using it for a while but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and love that it has all of the good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye to other not so healthy chapsticks!</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients and I love how smooth and nice the blam feeling you lips. It&#x27;s not greasy or goopy at all, and the flavors are great!</li>
    <li> Great product for a good price. This product contains Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Coconut Oil, Vitamin E, Organic Rosemary Extract, Organic Calendula and Natural Organic Flavors&lt;br /&gt;It is made of natural beeswax making this product great for your moisturizing your lips without any harmful ingredients. Its texture is really smooth and glides nicely. It does not leave any residue behind after drying. It comes in four different flavors -  Vanilla Bean, Peppermint, Raspberry and Asian Pear.&lt;br /&gt;Each one is unique in their own way. I personally liked raspberry and peppermint as i could smell them and kind of taste them which brought a fresh feeling.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in nice brown cardboard box packing. You may also use these for gifting.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommended. I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> Huge fan of this lip balm! Is it a bit pricier than chapstick? Yes. But I believe with all my heart that it is worth every penny! I used to have chronically chapped lips and had to apply chapstick like every hour, all the time wondering why it didn&#x27;t seem to help. I absolutely hate that dry cracked feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After changing my diet to about 90% organic, I felt great. So I figured, why stop there? I searched for organic lip balms, tried one or two that were very dry and disappointing...then found this brand. After reading reviews, I gave it a try and I am in love with these balms! I put it on MAXIMUM, 3 times a day. And usually because I just ate or brushed my teeth. I think in the long run I&#x27;ll save money because it actually helps the problem instead of masking it. My lips are healed, smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the raspberry, and only tried that and the Asian pear so far. It&#x27;s pretty good too!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product, not only for the organic, chemical free ingredients, but for the silky smooth application and result.&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> This lip balm goes on so smooth.  I especially love the peppermint.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Lovely texture, nice, simple scents. I wanted some basic, all natural lip balm and La Lune was perfect!</li>
    <li> Nice lip balms but it is small balm.</li>
    <li> Love the lip balm! Smooth texture and great flavors as well as prompt shipping!</li>
    <li> Very nice lip balm with all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Recently, I had developed an allergy to something I was putting on my face, particlarly my lips.  They would become red, peeling and swollen overnight. I was having to use a cream the dermatologist gave me, and no matter what, the condition remained until I started usi8ng La Lune Naturals USDA Lip Balms, which are organic and all natural.  They feel like velvet on my lips, too.  I  highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Make my lips smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loving these - I wanted a natural lip balm with coconut oil which is OH so wonderful for your skin.  I&#x27;ve been delighted with these which are full of great organic and natural ingredients.  My favorite is the raspberry - my daughter and I are constantly fighting over it because we both like it so much.  The vanilla is scrumptious - smells exactly like a vanilla bean.  The pear one smells surprisingly overly sweet and almost a bit &#x27;fake&#x27;, but once you have it on I find it actually smells/tastes just like a ripe, fresh bear.  The Peppermint one is the least impressive of the bunch - the peppermint seems to be very lacking as far as smell/taste, not strong at all, but I&#x27;ll still happily use it because it does such a fantastic job of moisturizing my lips.</li>
    <li> I love these! They feel so good on my lips and they moisturize really well. I like that they are organic so I can let my kids use them.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this. Its amazing, smoother than any i have ever tried and better yet organic</li>
    <li> I LOVE these lip balms. They smell so good, and smell just like the flavor they are. The formula used is perfect and smooth. Lasts a good long time on your lips, and soaks in fast leaving a soft and smooth lips. All four flavors rock, and comes inside a cute little box. They are pretty long so they will last you a long time for sure. All natural ingredients found inside per tube. My favorite is the purple and yellow one for sure. I put one in my purse, car, bathroom, and one on my night stand. I like how they give you so many so you can scatter them where you are the most. I have sensitive skin and it is hard for me to use certain balms, and these I was able to use without breaking out which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received product(s) for free, in exchange for an honest review, which may differ from yours. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I used personally, and believe will be good fit for consumers.</li>
    <li> I love these. I feel like they hydrate my dry lips well. I like all the flavors but my favorite has to be the raspberry. Peppermint  is the second favorite.  The other two are OK but I wish could just get a pack with my two favorites.</li>
    <li> These do a nice job of moisturizing my lips in the heat and the sun. They smell nice and I like that they are made from organic ingredients. My only suggestion would be to make an organic or all natural lip balm that also has some level of spf. That would be a 5 star lip balm to me.</li>
    <li> Love these! They make my lips very soft and actually stays on your lips for a long time.</li>
    <li> These lip balms work great!  I love the consistency- not too waxy or sticky.</li>
    <li> One of the best lip balms I have tried!! Very moisturizing!! Smells great too. Priced reasonable when you purchase it in this 4 pack. I will buy again. Better than Burts and Bees.</li>
    <li> La Lune Lip Balm is by far the Best lip balm I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something to heal my ridiculously dry upper lip.  The edge was so dry, it looked like I had lipstick on and a cold sore - ewww!  The  La Lune arrived today - 2 days after ordering - I applied the Asian Pear and voila!  My lips  look 100% better.&lt;br /&gt;La Lune is an Organic magic potion.  I&#x27;ve tried other lip balms with beeswax - they were hard to apply.  La Lune glides across my lips without tugging.  There are NO Parabens, GMOs or mineral oil !  I was fooled by other &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; products - only to discover they were chemical compost.  La Lune is an organic remedy for young and old alike.  If a child had dry lips - this would be the perfect treatment.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about licking off some horrible ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve only tried Asian Pear.  The flavor is subtle.  The balm is AMAZING.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to neighbors and family.&lt;br /&gt;AND&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Made in America!  Well done La Lune!</li>
    <li> i have many allergies, so I&#x27;m alway on the lookout for products I can use safely.  Your lip balm is not only good to my sensitivities it&#x27;s also smooth and soothing for my lips which tend to get dry from medications I have to take.  I&#x27;m very glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is best all organic lip balm so far..loved all flavors. Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for dry lips. Beeswax lip balm formulation is recommended for CPAP lip moisturization for my husband&#x27;s CPAP machine and this product has a pleasant taste and smell.</li>
    <li> I am a huge (and I really mean HUGE) fan of organic all natural lip balm. I had recently been using another organic lip balm but was starting to notice this red dry patch on the side of my lips and a dark ring around my bottom lip. Now I did not expect it to be my lip balm as what I was using was &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and I did not have a cold sore (I&#x27;ve just never had one). It was frustrating and I couldn&#x27;t get it to go away, until I tried the La Lune Naturals lip balm. After just one day of using it the ring on the bottom of my lip was gone and the size of the red spot on the side of my lip was less than half size and gone by day 3 (after sticking around for 2 moths previously). I also noticed I use a lot less of La Lune&#x27;s lip balm due to it actually moisturizing my lips, unlike the brand before I had before it. If you struggle with dry lips and/or marks around your lips I highly recommend you giving the La Lune Naturals lip balm a try. The peppermint is my favorite, it goes everywhere I go!! *I received this product free/discounted in exchange for my review. My reviews are completely honest and 100% my own.*</li>
    <li> I have to say as far as lip balm goes this is the top of the line! They are not only organic, they go on so smooth you will not believe it.&lt;br /&gt;I love that they are safe for my granddaughter to use as she is only 18 months and tends to &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; them. lol&lt;br /&gt;They have great flavors, my favorite is the pear. The ingredients in these balms are top of the line premium ingredients you can trust on your lips. No nasty chemicals to worry about getting in your body either.&lt;br /&gt;Throw away the Chapstick this stuff wins the race!&lt;br /&gt;I was given my products free of charge to facilitate this review.</li>
    <li> ALL FAVORS ARE WONDERFUL JUST THE ASIAN PEAR SMELLS VERY FOUL AND UNPLEASANT (IMO)</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my toddler as it is organic...so far so good.</li>
    <li> !!! ORGANIC !!!  Very smooth and last longer than non-organic chapstick.</li>
    <li> I really like this lip balm.  It&#x27;s very smooth and helps with the dryness.  I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Amazing lip balms! Every flavor is great and smooth! Lasts long and helps keep lips moisturizer. So smooth and protecting. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> going back to La Natura vanilla.  It&#x27;s more expensive but it&#x27;s the only really good lip balm I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> My young daughter purchased these for my birthday...then when she gave them to me asked if I would share two of them with her, lol.  She and I both enjoyed the balms - felt very nice. They keep our lips moisturized and we need them when we camp in dry weather.  I used peppermint and vanilla - awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm junkie. Pretty sure I&#x27;ve got about 20 of them now, all different brands and flavors. With this brand, the raspberry is my favorite... so smooth. And being organic, well, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Love how they feel on my lips. Great smell and super fast shipping and savings deal too</li>
    <li> Yummy and nourishing - absolutely love these and will be my new go-to lip balm for me and my husband.</li>
    <li> Love these lip balms! Keeps my lips from the constant chapping I had before discovering La Lune Naturals Lip Balm.</li>
    <li> I use these before bedtime. I used to use yestocarrots, but prefer these! Lasts a long time and I will repurchase when I&#x27;m out of flavors.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product received.  Exactly as described.  Will definitely order from this seller again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> These all organic lip balms are moisturizing and pleasant on the lips. Me and my children enjoyed using these, especially on the cold and windy days here is Northern Pennsylvania. I would definitely purchase these for future use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Item received for testing and review purposes.*</li>
    <li> I really like this lip balm. I gave the berry one to my 3yr old daughter and said &amp;#34;umm, this smells good&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s also a decent price, can&#x27;t com about that.</li>
    <li> Goes on very smooth and very pleasant vanilla bean flavor... I have only tried this one. Organic ingredients, too.</li>
    <li> I like it very much because it&#x27;s natural. I am glad it doesn&#x27;t have any chemical in it. Yes, I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> love the ingredients &amp; nice smell.  Finally something without soy.  We will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> My new lip balms could not have arrived on a better day.  I had been working on a demo/remodel job of an old farm house.  So, I was covered in plenty of old dirt that we stirred up along with Sheetrock &amp; sawdust among other very drying elements along with a dry, windy hot west Texas day. Okay.....she the parching going on?  When I got my mail at the end of the day, my new balms arrived (not to mention they arrived only a couple of days after I placed my order!!)  I opened them immediately and chose  the Raspberry flavor.  I could tell by the Silkiness that these were going to be a new perfect product for me.  Honestly my dry peeling lips that day were corrected by the time I made it to bed a couple of hours after applying.  I&#x27;m LOVING this new all natural product!!! Good one LaLune!!!</li>
    <li> I was using Burt&#x27;s Bees prior to buying this lip balm - and while I loved Burt&#x27;s Bees, I really wanted an organic lip balm that used quality ingredients (and nothing &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using La Lune Naturals for a couple of weeks now and I LOVE IT!!! I thought I&#x27;d never find anything I liked better than Burt&#x27;s, but now I can barely stand to use that stuff! I&#x27;m truly amazed at how great my lips feel! I love the LOOK of this lip balm a lot more, too  - it gives a more &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; look than Burt&#x27;s Bees does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using this lip balm to soften my cuticles, too. I apply it right before bed after doing my lips. It also works great for healing painful hangnails -- just apply it several times per day to the area. Another way you can use this product is on sore noses from too much blowing. Apply it on your nose throughout the day and and then liberally at night (I like to keep a special tube just for my nose) - and no more red and painful nose during your cold! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I placed my order, I didn&#x27;t realize I would get different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;. So far, I&#x27;ve tried the raspberry and pear. I love them both, but I&#x27;m partial to the pear flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around, this is a fantastic product that I will be referring to all of my blog readers and private group members for sure!!! Thanks bunches, La Lune!</li>
    <li> Though I like the results, I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  All the scents are a little off and smell vaguely of alcohol.  And it&#x27;s not just at application that I smell it, the scent from my lips bothers me for at least 15 minutes after putting it on.  :(</li>
    <li> Excellent  product. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Best for lip. Definitely will buy again !</li>
    <li> They are hydrating and not having that waxy film over like other lipbalm. I did not try the vanilla bean since I don&#x27;t like vanilla so I can&#x27;t tell if the smell is pleasant or not but I like the peppermint and raspberry flavor. However, the Asian pear which I have the most hope for since I love the fruit itself turned out to be a disappointment. It has a strong medicinal smell. So I got use 2 out of 4 tubes.</li>
    <li> Best lip palm I&#x27;ve used. Love it !!</li>
    <li> My organic lip balm arrived on time and certainly did not disappoint! Not only do they all have a great taste, but they are organic! My new favorite lip balm!</li>
    <li> Great quality lip balms!</li>
    <li> Great lip balm, love that these are organic. They go on smooth and have great natural smelling scents.  La Lune even sends coupons to use on Amazon!  Thanks La Lune!</li>
    <li> Softest, smoothest, CLEANEST lip care out there! Love the all-organic ingredients and packaging. Quick shipping and would purchase again!</li>
    <li> LOVE these lip balms! And I am a lip balm addict.  Can&#x27;t live w/o them; they are in my purse, on my desk, in my gym bag. These are as nice as any I&#x27;ve had, and being organic is certainly ice on the pudding. I mean pudding on the cake. Or whatever that is. ;~D</li>
    <li> La Lune Organic Lip Balm is the best lip balm I have ever used! Way better than Burt&#x27;s Bees. The Asian Pear has a very delicate scent/flavor and the Raspberry is my favorite. The balm applies very smoothly and is quite moisturizing! I love how my lips feel after using! I would definitely buy this product again. Thank you La Lune for another wonderful organic product.!</li>
    <li> These chapsticks are well made and very very well balanced moisturizer for lips.  They go on smoothly and soft.  I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with these products.  They shipped very fast and we&#x27;ll packaged.  They leave my lips soft and the scents of the fragrances smell good.  I bought several chapsticks in my life and these blow the other brands out the water.  I have used chapstcik my entire life and these are absolutely by far my favorite!!  I would recommend these to everyone!  :)&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the peppermint one and I wish we would be able to choose the items individually.  Other than that.  These are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great flavors and soft lips!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Leaves lips feeling super soft. One of my favorite balms. Wears very comfortable never greasy.</li>
    <li> I love these lip balm they are very moisturizing, and smell great. It&#x27;s definitely something I would repurchase, and the packaging was great!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using these lip balms. They smell good and work great! Will definitely buy again in the future!</li>
    <li> Nice feel and happy with the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Wanted to get a lip balm for my 3 yr old granddaugther who loves to use makeup like adults do.  Most makeups are full of toxic ingredients, even pretend makeup for children!  I chose this because it is made with all organic oils, beeswax and herbs.  Also it&#x27;s gluten free!  Very happy with the products.  Three of the four flavors are great - raspberry, vanilla bean and peppermint; only weird flavor is Asian Pear.  Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I live in the very dry Arizona desert.  I have tried every lip balm I can get my hands on.  This is the BEST product I have found in years.  It helps with the corners of my mouth that get dry &amp; cracked.  No waxy build up or icky smells.  I am very active and love the outdoors.  This stays on well even when hiking and sweating.  Highly Recommend this product. I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I ordered these 10 days ago and was really excited. I must say that I love the scents!! So far I&#x27;ve only tried the peppermint one and I really like it. Don&#x27;t expect something that glides on your lips as smoothly as a vaseline-based lip balm does. These are made from beeswax so they are a lil bit harder but still soft enough to glide on your lips and give them a good coat. I&#x27;ve read the ingredients (organic sunflower oil, organic beeswax, organic coconut oil, organic essential oil of peppermint, vitamin E, etc.) and believe that this balm will not kill you if you accidentally swallow some of it, however, I don&#x27;t suggest eating it to test my statement!</li>
    <li> Great lip balm! Recently developed very chapped lips after an international flight. This product cleared up the problem completely within just a few days. And it tastes great, too. Now I use it under lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Love how it&#x27;s not oily and moisturizing my lips, just don&#x27;t like peppermint flavor but pear is my favorite</li>
    <li> These lip balms are amazing! They have a smooth glide and are very hydrating. The flavor aren&#x27;t overbearing and they just feel amazing on my lips. I also like that they are organic and natural.</li>
    <li> I normally use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s but after trying La Lune Naturals, I have to say this is my new favorite lip balm.  It feels good and smells good &amp; I like the variety pack - all 4 are great.  I just purchased this 4 pack again as a gift.</li>
    <li> I received the lip balms and it did wonders for my dry lips. It was just right in weight and scent.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this company is using organic ingredients. I usually use EOS lip balm but honestly I have been a bit disappointment in there new scents. I just ordered this lip balm pack and I can not wait to try it. I love the organic part about it and I am sure it will be great, can not wait to smell them, the scents sounds wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;After I use them I will make an updated review.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I ordered the peppermint oil from this same company and I love it, great smell and has tons of uses. I like to put a few cotton balls in a paper cupcake tin then put drops of the LaLune Naturals Peppermint Oil on the cotton balls then put it under the seat of my car for a great natural car air fresher. I do that in my house too and makes your house smell great!</li>
    <li> Just received and tried one of the flavors.... Nice and smooth!!!</li>
    <li> these are fantastic in every way! Many commercial lip products have bad chemicals in them..these don&#x27;t, plus they feel great and make your lips feel spectacular!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order these as I live in Phx and I didn&#x27;t want them to melt in my mailbox! I actually received them at my door step on q Sunday! The texture of the Chapsticks is super smooth! I love how light they feel on my lips. They smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> These balms are so yummy, the smell is not overwhelming &amp; they&#x27;re good for people with sensitive skin. I definitely recomend them!</li>
    <li> The are a nice, creamy lip balm.  I like the natural ingredients.  They moisturize well.</li>
    <li> Great delivery and good product. Be prepared for very strong and tangy peppermint flavor.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product very much. Surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t melt in the hot and humid weather of Cancun. The only thing I didn&#x27;t see was an SPF rating, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how much protection I was getting from the UVA and UVB rays. It&#x27;s not noted on the product or box.</li>
    <li> I have tried LOTS of lip balm, use it 20 times a day.. this product smells and tastes great, makes my lips soft and hydrated, and does not leave any sticky, oily feel</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of natural and organic lip balms and this is a great product! It lasts and flavors are great. I will buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Nice lip balm, not too greasy, slick, or waxy. I&#x27;m a lip balm junkie so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I really like these lip balms.  They feel nice on- not too heavy, and they actually work to moisten and soften my dry, chapped lips.  They taste good too, although I&#x27;m not a fan of peppermint.  My favorite is the Asian pear, although to me it seems to taste more like Juicy Fruit gum.</li>
    <li> Seriously, I think I may have an addiction to lip balm. I can&#x27;t go one minute with out some on my lips. I made the mistake of purchasing the &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; lip balm from Blistex (the one in the blue tube) because I ran out and couldn&#x27;t wait to order some from Amazon. I used the Blistex brand for about 2 weeks and I didn&#x27;t put 2 &amp; 2 together until it was too late. Shortly after I started using it, my lips started getting very sore, red, and VERY chapped. I mean, we are talking painfully chapped. My lips started pealing and getting all wrinkley. I thought that maybe I spent too long on the beach and maybe they got burned, but that wasn&#x27;t it. It was the Blistex. I read the packaging to see what was in it and I was horrified. I returned the Blistex to the store and ordered the La Lune based on the reviews. I just got it today and what a difference!  The La Lune is so creamy &amp; buttery on my lips and the smell is terrific! I feel like my lips are healing as we speak! Thanks for a great product without all the questionable ingredients! I&#x27;m officially addicted!</li>
    <li> OK nothing spectacular</li>
    <li> I was a HUGE blister addict.  Never again after trying this product.  I will forever order La Lune Naturals!</li>
    <li> Just as expected thanks!</li>
    <li> Great chapstick. All natural and doesn&#x27;t feel waxy or make your lips &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Was not a fan of all the flavors. The only decent one is the peppermint one - the rest smell / taste super artificial and sweet. It makes me think that I have melted candy on my lips or something (especially the raspberry ones). I don&#x27;t find them particularly hydrating either. I think I&#x27;ll go back to my Dr. Dan&#x27;s Cortibalm (really effective but doesn&#x27;t smell/taste great).</li>
    <li> What I like, is that, the lip balm is not sticky where your hair will get caught in it. Also, it provides long lasting moisturization. The flavor could be sweeter. Overall, I enjoy using the product.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery.  Really like the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become something of a lip balm/chap stick hoarder lately. I get a lot in my different subscription boxes, which is good...to a point. I&#x27;ve found there&#x27;s a lot I don&#x27;t really like and that just sit in my purse after one or two uses. Either they don&#x27;t help with my chapped lips (thanks winter!) or I don&#x27;t like the texture/feel. I was worried that these would be added to the list, but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the smell of the Raspberry and Asian Pear. The Peppermint is a bit strong for me and I worry about headaches, so this one will be used very sparingly. Vanilla Bean has never been a favorite of mine, although, the smell is light enough that I may be able to use it/won&#x27;t really notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the lip balms is what I really like. It goes on smooth and leaves my lips feeling silky/well moisturized. No stickiness or residue left over as well. Overall, a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free from la lune naturals in exchange for my honest evaluation of their product. All opinions stated here in this blog post are strictly my own.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these lip balms! They are so soft and buttery feeling. As soon as I received the package, I immediately opened them and put the Asian Pear flavor on first. I love the flavors, but what I love even more, is that the flavors aren&#x27;t overpowering. I&#x27;m so happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> I prefer to wear lip balm over lipstick. Even if I do wear lipstick, I like to use a good lip balm underneath. Problem for me is that I don&#x27;t always find the kind of lip balm that I want. I especially like balms that are made from organic ingredients. This sounded like a product that I just had to try and I&#x27;m thrilled that it came in a pack of four.&lt;br /&gt;The labels are nice and the flavor variety is great. I&#x27;m very pleased that these particular lip balms are non-toxic, non-GMO, gluten free, organic, and natural-- not many of the other lip balms that I&#x27;ve tried are.&lt;br /&gt;They are not tinted, which is fine with me. Keeps my lips looking nice and a little shiny.&lt;br /&gt;All of the flavors are nice and very light. My favorite is the Asian Pear one. I love that the balms go on really smoothly, keeping my lips soft and smooth for a long time. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t cake up and turn white or end up actually drying my lips out more later on. This balm works very well. I&#x27;m beyond happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this four pack of La Lune Naturals Organic Lip Balm for reviewing purposes. All opinions expressed are solely based off of my own experience with the product. No other compensation was received.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend LOVES these !</li>
    <li> I really Enjoy the Chapstick! Was having problems with burts bees causing my lip to be sore and broke out. No problems With this brand ordered for 2nd time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip balm brand in the US — it&#x27;s better than Carmex and Burt&#x27;s Bees.  (Nivea is #2).&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.  The raspberry one is especially yummy.  -1 point because the pear one smelled and tasted funky.&lt;br /&gt;I love that everything is organic and natural! :D</li>
    <li> Every product I have purchased from LaLune has been first rate, these organic lip balms included.  It&#x27;s frequently windy where I live and my job has me outdoors a lot, so I have tried a few different balms.  None better than these.</li>
    <li> I bought these bc I needed a good, non toxic lip balm. These are better than anything I&#x27;ve tried from the drugstore and better than any &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; lip balms I&#x27;ve used in the past. Amazing price, too.</li>
    <li> I received these lip balms free courtesy of lalunenaturals and I have to say I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;ve gotten to try these, they go on your lips soooo smooth and give a nice light shine without feeling and looking greasy. My favorite is the raspberry flavor it&#x27;s a sweet scent and I really like it, the others are great too especially Asian Pear it&#x27;s a minty but fruity scent. If you have issues with dry lips definitely give these a try.</li>
    <li> I received my La Lune Naturals Lip Balms in the mail as expected.  They are awesome!!!  I highly recommend ordering some!!!  Kudos!!!!</li>
    <li> great to know these are organic and work very well</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lip balms! I got a discount for trying them, and they are extremely moisturizing. I will definitely purchase again, and love the fact that I can use them on my littles, without being concerned about harmful ingredients. Thanks for having such great specials, that allow customers to try your great products!</li>
    <li> I prefer this lip balm over others because I have the bad habit of licking my lips. I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m hurting myself if I ingest a little.</li>
    <li> I love these lip balms. The scents are lovely and they feel so buttery and smooth when applied. They also last a long time before having to reapply more. I&#x27;m addicted to lip balms and chap sticks, and these definitely fit the bill for me. I&#x27;ll be back to buy more. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that they are made from all natural, organic ingredients, however, they do not offer enough moisturizing for my lips.  Because of some medications I take, my lips are extremely dry.  I am sure they are perfect for others.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the lip balm.  Lips feel great.  I especially like the peppermint!</li>
    <li> love the smells and works well</li>
    <li> I have never used any other lip balm that applies with the sensual pleasure that La Lune’s does. This is an EXCELLENT product, for a fair price, from an Earth-conscious enterprise.  La Lune is a business to support — you get expedient shipping, eco-friendly packaging, a wonderful product, AND you help to support products that do not threaten human health or Mother Earth.  La Lune is a welcome change to the deluge of commerce-driven products sold without regard to the consequences of their additives, colorings, preservatives, etc.  I will be a regular La Lune customer!</li>
    <li> Oh, This is good stuff! Smooth, creamy, and not sticky. It is also long lasting. The lip balm has a hint of flavor that doesn&#x27;t overpower you. And thank goodness no citrus flavors. I am so tired of Lemon, and orange flavor. I hesitated because the description said best for kids and babies, but it was just what I was looking for. I thought old lips are as tender and sensitive as baby lips. I am really pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing. Love that they are organic!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this lip balm!!!  My lips are so moisturized and there is no drying effects like normal lip balm.  I have shared it with both my daughters and they love it!  Will be back for more!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing lip balm with quality, organic ingredients.  I prefer the peppermint flavored balm which I would give 5 stars to and would order again.  The other flavors are not to my liking.</li>
    <li> I bought these for teacher gifts so I have them tried myself. But the packaging was gift worthy, coming in a cute box.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Don&#x27;t care for the Pear smell as much as the others. Would love to try a Root Beer flavor!  Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> good quality.  they flavoring could be a little more potent.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Prompt delivery</li>
    <li> Nice but the scents are a bit strong for my taste.</li>
    <li> These do not come sealed</li>
    <li> great product, last a while. healed my lips well</li>
    <li> I am a lip balm addict and I love these!  They go on light (it doesn&#x27;t feel like a layer of wax) and there is a subtle hint of flavor when you initially put it on.</li>
    <li> I loved them.  The Asian pear flavor smells really good.</li>
    <li> The raspberry is quite good, with a nice texture and flavor.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to be heartless so I gave 4 stars. The ingredients, the texture are good but the flavors... The raspberry is wonderful, the vanilla isn&#x27;t bad but I full with vanilla scented/tasted/flavored things, peppermint would be okay if you like peppermint and the asian pear is awful. There is no way to use it. I know people are different so maybe I&#x27;m just a picky one (I have a &amp;#34;hunting dog nose&amp;#34;) and somebody else can enjoy it. But as a 4 pack when I can&#x27;t choose the flavors it would be better more common like coconut, strawberry. On the other hand this lip balm is 5 stars thanks for the excellent ingredients my Daughter can use it too. She chose the raspberry one. I wish there were 2 raspberry instead of asian pear. I will order it in the future too hope there will be more choice with the flavors.</li>
    <li> These came well packaged. These came very quickly to me as well. I have only used the vanilla bean so far. I love it. Product is very good quality. Would recommend and I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are so hydrating and great! Me, my husband, and my son all use them, and it is nice not having to worry about the ingredients since they are organic! I would highly recommend purchasing! The scents are not too harsh, and the flavors are great!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like any of the flavorings. Neither did other family members</li>
    <li> My lips are extremely dry in the winter time, and these lip balms are wonderful for dry, chapped lips.  They go on smoothly with no waxy feel.  My lips already feel much smoother after only a few days of use.  The favors are yummy, and I love that they are 100% organic.  I would definitely recommend this product and I will buy these lip balms again!  These would make great stocking stuffers at Christmas, or for a little something extra in that birthday gift bag !</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my lip balms!  They go on incredibly smooth and and are all yummy - although my favorite is the peppermint!  Well done, La Lune Naturals!</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It&#x27;s better than other lip balms.  Seems to nourish and to stay on longer.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm!!!! Smells great, feels great and love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural!! My toddler loves it too!!! I have to hide them from her!! lol (:</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lip balms and so does my husband. I&#x27;m so happy I finally found a really good ORGANIC lip balm.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all the flavors yet but I like it, seems to always keep lips looking healthy with a nice shine:)</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm! It goes on so smoothly and is instantly moisturizing. The scents are subtle and lovely too!!</li>
    <li> Great natural lip balm. Nicely packaged, could be used as a gift.</li>
    <li> As soon as I seen La Lune Naturals Lip Balm I thought of my children. Their lips are so dry during the winter months and they use lip balm all the time. I tried each flavor and they were great. They kept my lips nice and moist and also helped heal my dry lips. A lot of lip balms are packed with chemicals and additives and I a happy to know these are not especially when it comes to my children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I loved that it was all Organic. Four great flavors: peppermint, raspberry, Asian pear, and vanilla bean. PURE ALL NATURAL LIP BALM: Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Coconut Oil, Vitamin E, Organic Rosemary Extract, Organic Calendula and Natural Organic Flavors. I received these Lip Balm complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with these lip balms and the flavors. Peppermint is my favorite and love they way my lips feel.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! Very creamy, great flavors and soothed our chapped lips from the horrible cold winter we had. Ordered them on Friday, received on Sunday!</li>
    <li> I am going to start by saying that I did NOT get this item for free. I paid for it, and quite happily too. I find it hard to accept reviews from people who don&#x27;t actually pay for things because part of the disappointment or satisfaction with products is due to cost and use. So I paid for this item and absolutely love it. It is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is natural and smells heavenly. My husband who is not a fan of natural products tried it and said, &amp;#34;Wow. Am I really not supposed to eat this? It smells like I should eat it. And it feels so good. It lubricates my lips, in such a nice way&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves this non-greasy, tenderly soft feeling on your lips. And it is good for you. The smells are just an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for another amazing product. I have had only good experiences with La Lune. I have many of their items...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advantage to these are that I keep them to myself. I wouldn&#x27;t give them to my kids, They would chew it up as soon as they smelled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good lip balm. Works just as good as any others I&#x27;ve tried but ingredients are all things I&#x27;ve actually heard of. Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I have been using a commercial brand of lip balm for a while that is made from natural ingredient,s and I have to admit I just love the product.  However, I am always open to trying new organic products, and the flavors of these balms sound like dessert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Non-GMO&lt;br /&gt;Non-Toxic&lt;br /&gt;Safe for babies&lt;br /&gt;Soy Free&lt;br /&gt;No Petroleum-ewww&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty-Free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients alone are a big selling factor for me for these lip balms.  Organic, non-GMO, and non-Toxic are super important to me.  I love that I Can feel safe handing a tube of this to my children and knowing there is nothing in the product to harm my child!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ADDICTED to the Raspberry lip balm.  It just smells so amazing, and I want to re-apply often just for the scent alone!  My dog gave a big paws up because these balms were never tested on his family members.  My dog is another one of my children, and I refuse to use any products that were tested on animals.  This is not a negotiating point for me, and I have been known to stop using a product I am in love with because they were tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can readily recognize and tell you where every ingredient comes from:  Beeswax, organic coconut oil, Sunflower oil, Vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These balms work well.  My son has really bad allergies and it is pollen time again.  His lips went from normal to cracked from one day to the next, so I slathered his lips in this balm and within a day they were back to being supple and not hurting him again.  We love any product that utilizes my beloved coconut oil, so I am officially in love with this balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mint was my 2nd favorite flavor, and the vanilla and Asian pear flavors are in my children&#x27;s purses as we speak.  I typically pay $4.19 per balm that I usually buy and these are right under $11 for 4 balms so they are way cheaper than what I have been using.  I am officially a new favorite customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally would love this same product offered in a glass or metal tin to be applied with my finger so that it meets my no plastic preference, but it is almost impossible to find any brand of balm that isn&#x27;t in a plastic container, so this isn&#x27;t a ¨break it¨ problem that will prevent me from purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********Disclaimer:  I received a product for a review.  All opinions stated are 100% honest and my exclusive opinion*******s my no plastic preference, but it is almost impossible to find any brand of balm that isn&#x27;t in a plastic container, so this isn&#x27;t a ¨break it¨ problem that will prevent me from purchasing this product.  ********Disclaimer:  I received a product for a review.

    <li> It&#x27;s like having a combination of all the best lip chaps and essential oils and flavors in one. I love it. Goes on smooth and definitely prevents all dryness.  I will be ordering this product regularly.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, the smell is great and feels great on.</li>
    <li> I only use natural lip balm because my lips are sensitive to the mineral oil and other drug store lip balms. Love these!</li>
    <li> Lovely scents, smooth texture that rolls on easily, and a decent price for organic.  I like them all!</li>
    <li> I love it !!!!!!!BEST lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> These products are awesome, love the all organic ingredient list and my lips are soft and wonderful!  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> You can never have enough lip balm; I put it on obsessively. The fact that these are organic and GMO free makes it even better! They have great scents/tastes and works very well!</li>
    <li> Absolutely loving these new chopsticks! Not only did they come two days early(yippie!) but they are the same amazing quality of all lalune products! I couldn&#x27;t wait to open and try them all. They make your lips feel nourished, moisturized and smooth instantly with out a bunch of chemicals. I love that I know everything in the ingredients list. My husband even loves them, so he got two I got two. Great natural product for a great price.</li>
    <li> These did not give me a weird feeling in my throat the way some of the Burts bees lip balms do...Almost like i have an allergy to something in BB&#x27;s--but not these. They were great. They were effective, not sticky, didn&#x27;t taste gross, and the smell wasn&#x27;t overwhelming. Some lip products are so strong smelling/tasting that i cant even bare to eat or drink with them on. This wasnt the case here. Mild and non-perfumey, yet pleasant. I liked the raspberry best. The vanilla and mint were also fine by me. However, I was not a fan of the pear.  But overall, very good product for me.</li>
