<li> All the little gems are intact when I received it, and it has maintained it&#x27;s beauty ever since.</li>
<li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll wear it or give it away as a gift.</li>

    <li> This is a nice, heavy and pretty hair pn but be sure you have long hair or a thick ponytail to stick this in because it is big.
