      <li>I think it was a good buy.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping, everything was labeled correctly, very happy!</li>

      <li>i love them!</li>
      <li>I think these are amazing</li>
      <li>All wrapped up and packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>Great price, great quality and fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d paid more attention, because I didn&#x27;t notice the kit doesn&#x27;t include any tunnels, but that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
      <li>great tapers, no burrs or other defects on any of them... would love an option for a storage case, but am totally happy with these!</li>
      <li>Overall great product and great quality though.</li>
      <li>started with the smallest &amp; made it to a 0 with these tapers they&#x27;re amazing &amp; very easy to clean</li>
      <li>Got everything and more</li>
      <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>steel tapers are SO much better for stretching than acrylic, and these are no exception.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy for me to remember what size I need to go up to.  </li>
      <li>and I was really excited to start using them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited but disapointed.</li>
      <li>Love stainless steel.</li>
      <li>I received package quickly.</li>
      <li>Overall this is amazing.</li>
      <li>Came very fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good price, and the tapers are very nice, a bit heavy when you get into the bigger sizes, but I think that&#x27;s to be expected with stainless steel.</li>
      <li>Thanks 😀</li>
      <li>Additionally the rings to hold the tapers in worked really well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I used the size 8g as jewelry for a couple of weeks while waiting for my new tunnels to arrive, they stayed in and I got lots of complements.</li>
      <li>I was able to go from a 4 gauge to a 0 gauge in about 6 weeks without any excessive irritation.</li>
      <li>The rubber circles fall off easily, but that&#x27;s only with the smaller smaller sizes.</li>
      <li>The o-rings are tight, so they&#x27;re a little tough to get off at first, but they don&#x27;t fall out easily, which is good.</li>
      <li>This did not allow for me to properly stretch my ears at a moderate spread but instead was basically like pushing the next size right into your ear.</li>

<li> This did not allow for me to properly stretch my ears at a moderate spread but instead was basically like pushing the next size right into your ear.</li>
<li> /&gt;It came earlier than expected, and came with separate bags with the sizes on them.</li>
<li> These tapers helped my newly stretched ears heal alot quicker than leaving my gauges in over night.</li>
<li> almost all of the orings on the sizes from 14 to 6 fell off, theyre way too loose.</li>
<li> Having tight o-rings makes it easier to go up sizes because you can stop in the middle and wait for your ear to adjust before you go ahead and work your way up all the way to the end.</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet so no real info.</li>
<li> The product came a lot sooner than I expected</li>
<li> I&#x27;m at a 6 and had to put an 8 O ring on to keep it from slipping off</li>
<li> Because they&#x27;re heavy, they pull your lobes down and back a little.</li>
<li> but I had a slight problem.</li>
<li> they are shorter then the acrylic which is a little aggravating also</li>
<li> I give it 4stars because the 0&amp;00 are very small and hard stay in your ear and gave me a lot pain.</li>

    <li> steel tapers are SO much better for stretching than acrylic, and these are no exception. i love them!</li>
    <li> Very nice product, my girlfriend loves them and they look really good too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t include size 2 tapers or plugs, baggies were incorrectly labeled, no plugs included for size 0 or 00.</li>
    <li> Arrival faster. Good product. Love stainless steel. Workwd great for my husband. I give it 4stars because the 0&amp;00 are very small and hard stay in your ear and gave me a lot pain.</li>
    <li> This included everything it should have. All wrapped up and packaged nicely. Haven&#x27;t used them yet so no real info. It appears to he quality metal tho</li>
    <li> almost all of the orings on the sizes from 14 to 6 fell off, theyre way too loose.</li>
    <li> I love them. They are great. I hope I can stretch to 00 by the end of the month. I used to stretch my ears.</li>
    <li> These tapers are just what I was looking for.  Great price, great quality and fast delivery.  I also appreciate that they were packaged in labeled pairs so it&#x27;s easy for me to remember what size I need to go up to.  Additionally the rings to hold the tapers in worked really well. I used the size 8g as jewelry for a couple of weeks while waiting for my new tunnels to arrive, they stayed in and I got lots of complements.</li>
