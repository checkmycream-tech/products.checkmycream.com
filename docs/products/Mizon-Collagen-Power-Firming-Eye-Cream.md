      <li>It has a great texture and does wonders.</li>
      <li>And looks great</li>
      <li>I read about MIZON products on a beauty blog, and decided that I would give it a try because it is inexpensive and has great reviews on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I use this with my five minute facelift after it has dryed, and it looks great.</li>
      <li>Loving it!</li>
      <li>It is a great addition to my night routine and though I&#x27;m in my 20s, there is nothing better than preventative measures.</li>
      <li>I w s very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>

      <li>it is a great product i can see a difference i would highly recommend</li>
      <li>Sooo good and very fast</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a laser treatment smooth and plump, but it&#x27;s pretty darn good.  </li>
      <li>Makeup applies easily over it and stays all day.</li>
      <li>I will say that this collagen cream had been available</li>
      <li>It glides onto the skin smoothly, and keeps my eye area</li>
      <li>Like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>Product is great at moisturizing delicate skin around the eye area.</li>
      <li>Happy that it makes skin around eyes soft, not sure about building collagen, but worth another bottle to continue treatment.</li>
      <li>But the claims of collagen firming and helping with under eye circles, not so much.</li>
      <li>Really like thisp oroduct and the price is not out of line.</li>
      <li>I like this product because it has a light texture with deep moisturizing properties.</li>
      <li>but it really helps.</li>
      <li>It really does plump up the skin.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say much about the anti-wrinkle properties, since, you know, I&#x27;m eighteen, but it did reduce puffiness.</li>
      <li>I really like the feel of this collagen product</li>
      <li>so much I use it on my face</li>
      <li>Anything from a jar is much easier to control.</li>
      <li>im very please with this eye cream</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light gel and not heavy or sticky..........makes your skin feel soft .........</li>
      <li>Under eye area did not feel particularly moisturized.</li>
      <li>Hence, highly introduce.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes but then again, I am only 21 years old</li>
      <li>The affects don&#x27;t last all day but it does a nice job of smoothing and firming the eye area for a few hours.</li>
      <li>Unoffensive smell, and does not irritate my very sensitive eye area in any way.</li>
      <li>This might sound a lot but anyone with severe eczema can tell you that it&#x27;s a godsend to be applying so little.</li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:moZJDCDK1JZY57]]I have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>I just got today my order ,  but when I open the jar it was only half full!</li>
      <li>I do not recommend this product for such a sensitive area.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and rich and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.</li>

<li> Its non greasy, affordable and will last a long time.  </li>
<li> well hydrated all day long, without looking oily.</li>
<li> I was so surprized It will go a long way.</li>
<li> This is from the perspective of someone with eczema (dry skin).</li>
<li> The little tube (10ml) lasted a while but was hard to control how much product came out.</li>
<li> My wife uses now only creams that firm.</li>
<li> A little of this goes a LONG way.</li>
<li> The feeling of this eye cream is slightly oily so a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I would recommend using this only at night because it is thick and can spread if sweating occurs.</li>
<li> I would recommend Kose eye cream, although a little pricey, the eye cream helps a lot with moisturizing and and whitening.</li>
<li> Well, I bought a small tube of this stuff months ago, and when I used it, it took away almost all traces of the dark circles AND bags.</li>
<li> It made a difference, not a huge difference</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have very dark under eye circles, just some from late nights, so</li>
<li> i like this product, no sure about all the ingrediants etc</li>
<li> I&#x27;d hoped this stuff would help with my dark circles (probably a little stupid, yeah)</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t comment on anything worse than that.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very skeptical of anything that says it will help with eye firming.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from bad eye bags, and I thought nothing would help.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t do a thing, and smells very bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> leaves you with a gresy eye and your mascara smear under your eye and it looks like someone socked you in the eye or you&#x27;re trying to look like Alice Copper</li>
    <li> Sooo good and very fast :D&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU ^^</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a thing, and smells very bad.</li>
    <li> 5 starsssssss!!! it is the best ever.</li>
    <li> Gel-like texture. Odorless. I feel eye areas feel more hydrated since using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d hoped this stuff would help with my dark circles (probably a little stupid, yeah) buuuut it didn&#x27;t. It also irritated my skin a bit at the outer corners. Under eye area did not feel particularly moisturized. I can&#x27;t say much about the anti-wrinkle properties, since, you know, I&#x27;m eighteen, but it did reduce puffiness.</li>
    <li> I just got today my order ,  but when I open the jar it was only half full! And it&#x27;s look like  as if someone has already used!  Will never buy  again!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! It&#x27;s thick and rich and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all. I would recommend using this only at night because it is thick and can spread if sweating occurs. My mom tried using it during the day and it didn&#x27;t work out. I don&#x27;t have very dark under eye circles, just some from late nights, so I can&#x27;t comment on anything worse than that. It is a great addition to my night routine and though I&#x27;m in my 20s, there is nothing better than preventative measures. Would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Just re-ordered.  Happy that it makes skin around eyes soft, not sure about building collagen, but worth another bottle to continue treatment.</li>
    <li> i like this product, no sure about all the ingrediants etc but i like how it feels.</li>
    <li> My wife uses now only creams that firm. Very pleased. And looks great</li>
    <li> This is from the perspective of someone with eczema (dry skin). The price is amazing and I have used products quadruple mizon&#x27;s price that didn&#x27;t work as well as this. I do find myself having to apply twice a day, once after nighttime cleansing and once when I wake up in the morning if I&#x27;m not starting my morning routine to get out the door. This might sound a lot but anyone with severe eczema can tell you that it&#x27;s a godsend to be applying so little. But the claims of collagen firming and helping with under eye circles, not so much. If I&#x27;m short on cash then I definitely reconsider buying this product. I would recommend Kose eye cream, although a little pricey, the eye cream helps a lot with moisturizing and and whitening. I know when people with eczema hear whitening they run for the hills but it really helps.</li>
    <li> Like this product very much.  Its non greasy, affordable and will last a long time.  The best part is my friend said my under eye area looks good!  I notice a difference in the skin around my eyes.  Smooth!</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this product! The affects don&#x27;t last all day but it does a nice job of smoothing and firming the eye area for a few hours.</li>
    <li> Really like thisp oroduct and the price is not out of line.</li>

Anything from a jar is much easier to control. A little of this goes a LONG way.</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction after using this cream for two days. Skin around my eyes was red and puffy. I do not recommend this product for such a sensitive area.</li>
    <li> I Been using it for a couple days im very please with this eye cream I would recomend to everyone</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this collagen product so much I use it on my face........it&#x27;s light gel and not heavy or sticky..........makes your skin feel soft .........I love the feel of it!</li>
    <li> Product is great at moisturizing delicate skin around the eye area. Haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes but then again, I am only 21 years old so I&#x27;m not looking for wrinkle reduction ect. The feeling of this eye cream is slightly oily so a little goes a long way. I like this product because it has a light texture with deep moisturizing properties.</li>
    <li> It really makes your eye area firm; you can actually feel the difference.  Loving it!</li>
    <li> I w s very pleased with this product.  It really does plump up the skin.  It&#x27;s not a laser treatment smooth and plump, but it&#x27;s pretty darn good.  Some of the products that I have purchased, believe it or not, I have yet to try.  When I do I will rate them.  I say this because I have been requested to give my review and I can&#x27;t if I haven&#x27;t used them.  I will definitely  purchase this product again.  I will say that this collagen cream had been available I would have started using it in my 20s.  I feel that I could not begin too soon to do what I can for staving off the ravages of time.</li>
    <li> I do love this I was so surprized It will go a long way. You only need a tiny bit to use. I use this with my five minute facelift after it has dryed, and it looks great.</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable find! I read about MIZON products on a beauty blog, and decided that I would give it a try because it is inexpensive and has great reviews on Amazon. This is a giant jar when compared to comparable products! It glides onto the skin smoothly, and keeps my eye area well hydrated all day long, without looking oily. Makeup applies easily over it and stays all day. Unoffensive smell, and does not irritate my very sensitive eye area in any way. I recommend this to my friends, and to anyone else for that matter! I am a customer for life!</li>
    <li> it is a great product i can see a difference i would highly recommend</li>
    <li> It made a difference, not a huge difference but it did make a difference</li>
    <li> Thank you it&#x27;s amazing item</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moZJDCDK1JZY57]]I have sensitive eyes and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t cause any irritations to my eyes. Hence, highly introduce.</li>
