<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good prices!  Thought the time it took to receive the item was a little long.</li>
    <li> I previously rated this lotion with 5 stars having had none of the other reviewers&#x27; similar experiences.  With my last order, however, all that changed.  The color was a little off--not the snowy white--more of a tannish white, and then I used it for the first time.  Boy, did I have to eat my words.  This is just awful.  The smell is beyond bad.  In fact, even combining it with my favorite lavendar oil doesn&#x27;t make it smell better.  It&#x27;s still emollient, but there&#x27;s no getting past the smell and I&#x27;ve had to breathe through my mouth to escape the smell while putting it on.  I&#x27;m currently debating whether or not I&#x27;ll ever buy more of this stinky stuff.  It&#x27;s nasty.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the NEW owners of Alba has chosen to alter the formula of several of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have added several ingredients that in my opinion make this lotion a poor choice for someone who cares about the toxic and potentially harmful chemicals they apply to their body. They also moved the dimethecone several places up on the ingredients list so it contains even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also changed the scent. The new scent is horrible. It smells like some lotion my SIL brought from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed them my concerns basically they said their customers help them determine what they prefer. I guess they dont know who their customers are. Ive spoken to the natural foods stores I shop in and they are considering whether or not they will carry the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a list of ingredients they added. Polysorbate 60, Potassium Hydroxide, Xanthan Gum, Alcohol (1), Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Amyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxycitronellal,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make your own decisions but if you buy this product because of a lack of harmful ingredients, sadly, this is no longer the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******UPDATE*******&lt;br /&gt;After trying several lotions I am currently using Loving Naturals bubblegum scent, I am sooo tired of lavender. It has no toxic ingredients, best of all Im not allergic to it. [[ASIN:B0058NWS04 Loving Naturals Hand &amp; Body Lotion - Bubblegum - 16 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;For now amazon has the best price but I am planning on contacting the manufacturer for a bulk order and possibly better pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another option is Organic bath company. Avoid the Fig as it can cause skin cancer when exposed to sun. It also has topoherols which I try to avoid but isnt a huge concern. [[ASIN:B0040OXS5Q Lavender Vanilla Super Hydrating Lotions - 14.2 oz,(Fresh Organics)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another chemical to avoid is phenoxyethanol. Sadly a lot of so called natural and organic lotions are using this preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the lotions I tried that came in a larger bottle with a pump the Loving Naturals and Organic Bath company lotions were the most effective moisturizers. Mill Creek Botanicals was the worst, my hands always felt dry after using it.larger bottle with a pump the Loving Naturals and Organic Bath company lotions were the most effective moisturizers. Mill Creek Botanicals was the worst, my hands always felt dry after using it.</li>
    <li> I used to love the old formula of this lotion.  The scent was great and it went on so smoothly.  I recently got the new formula and it smells terrible and is nowhere near as good as the old.  This used to be the only lotion I used and now I have to find something else.  If you can find the old formula or if they ever go back to it get it, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Alba is a great brand and I like many of their products.  This moisturizer has no scent, goes on super light and smooth, and absorbs very quickly.  My only concern is that it seems like this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t last all day.  I have been having to apply more later in the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alba products for years and was very satisfied with everyone one of them.  I just received my new order and to my dismay they have changed this one. This stuff feels like grease when applied and it smells bad too. I&#x27;m sending mine back. I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the worst stuff I have ever purchased.  I&#x27;m hoping I can return it.  It&#x27;s horribly gritty; like rubbing sand in my skin. It&#x27;s nearly as fluid as water.  I&#x27;m not sure if this bottle is spoiled or what, but I won&#x27;t be bothering to find out.</li>
    <li> Love the price!  so much cheaper then at the healthfood store!  Great product!  Love the smell and feel of this lotion.  it works great.</li>
    <li> Used this for many years as is or with added essential oils; simply the best neutral lotion.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of Alba products, so when I received this lotion, I was a bit disappointed with the formula. This particular one is a bit more \\&quot;runny\\&quot; than Alba&#x27;s other lotions, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because this is unscented?! Regardless, it does work as the other lotions do and as always, I appreciate this because it does not test on animals and it&#x27;s all plant-based, another plus for me! Other than the above fore-mentioned, I am still satisfied with the lotion.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the old formula of the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Alba Botanica Very Emollient Body Lotion and always bought the 32 oz size.  I love using a pump and since I have the storage space, I like the cost-effective larger bottle.  A little goes a long way with this lotion so the large bottle really lasted a nice long time between purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was running low on my bottle, I bought a new one, not really paying attention to the pink triangle in the upper left corner claiming \\&quot;new improved hydration.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home, I put it next to my near-empty bottle and noticed the pump is green instead of the old white and noticed the pink triangle.  I decided to use the old version on one arm and the new version on the other arm after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got off the phone with customer service (888-659-7730) to let them know the terrible difference I did notice and what I didn&#x27;t notice.  I noticed no difference in \\&quot;hydration\\&quot; so it is not a bit improved in my personal experience.  However, I do notice a big difference in the smell.  The new \\&quot;original\\&quot; smells a lot stronger in a cloying, super-sweet way. I dont like it at all.  The old \\&quot;original\\&quot; version had a much more subtle smell, that didn&#x27;t catch high in my throat the way the new version does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a noticeable difference in feel as well.  The new version feels thinner and more slippery.  The older version is thicker and feels softer on my fingers, not slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I would have noticed a difference in the feel had I not tried them at the same exact moment, but the smell difference is pretty big and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this review hoping that more people will contact the company to ask them to either chang the formula back to the previous version or to offer the old formula in a different bottle for more money.  I assume they changed the formula to make it cheaper to make, which is a big disappointment.  I would have preferred to pay more for the same formula because I can&#x27;t find another brand of lotion that I like half as much as the old \\&quot;original\\&quot; very emollient lotion. :(d of lotion that I like half as much as the old \\&quot;original\\&quot; very emollient lotion. :(</li>
    <li> I love this brand and use many of their products but this one caused me to break out and I returned it.</li>
    <li> My new favorite lotion!</li>
    <li> Great lotion for dry skin. Rich, like putting whipped cream on your body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and years and LOVED it! But the company must have changed their formula as well as their label. It smelled horrible! I had to return it. I even emailed the company but they never responded.</li>
    <li> Four years ago I researched lotions to find one that was natural, not greasy or oily and worked great on my skin. I fell in love with Alba! Once I&#x27;ve found a product I love, I stick with it.. never thinking I needed to re-check the ingredients. This was a learning experience for me. Running out of lotion from the last bottle I purchased, my husband finally said to me... \\&quot;that new lotion you have stinks every time you use it.. I checked the ingredients and it is full bad stuff..\\&quot; I was stunned - new lotion? I have been using Alba for years. My great Alba - stinks? Full of bad stuff? I went and checked and yes, the list of good ingredients now also has stuff I was trying to keep out of our house and off my skin. Our skin is the largest organ on your body and absorbs chemicals right into your blood stream.. What do you want going into your system?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m done. Alba - you have lost a customer for good. Will I go back if you change? Maybe? but that means I need to check the list of ingredients every time I buy. Who has time for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. Hope you saved lots of money, you will need it with the loyal customers you will loose.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write negative reviews, but for this product, I wanted to warn others like me.&lt;br /&gt;This product is far from natual - it smells artifical and it feels wrong...&lt;br /&gt;Expect the product to be similar to that of P&amp;G.</li>
    <li> I have fair, sensitive skin and this is by far my favorite all-over body lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy, not heavy, has a light, pleasant fragrance that won&#x27;t interfere with your perfume and the softness lasts all day. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion on sale at Fredmyer buy 1 get 1 free and loved it but the price was the same as this big bottle on amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because I am in love with Alba products. It goes on very smooth and smells great but my only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like it to. I noticed that as soon as I wash my hands, or after a while, my hands are starting to get dry again and I find myself reapplying the lotion again. However, because it doesn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients I would purchase again in the future. Overall, I am satisfied with yet another Alba product.</li>
    <li> This lotion does the trick! Smells great although light fragrance, and can be enjoyed by male or female. Nice and thick, but not greasy. I will purchase this lotion again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read other people&#x27;s reviews that they changed their formula.  Maybe I never used the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; formula, but I do love everything about this bottle of lotion and I&#x27;ve purchased it several times over the last 3 years.  It&#x27;s a great all over lotion, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t promote breakouts (but I rarely use it on my face), pleasant scent.  I would totally but it again!</li>
    <li> This lotion is light yet moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years! If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you should, then you will be hooked on it too!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and have used it for years!  Every time I try something different, I end up going back to using the Original Alba Botanica Very Emollient Body Lotion!</li>
    <li> This product is very good for very dry skin. The only drawback is the smell, which while not totally unpleasant,could be a little more pleasing to the senses.</li>
    <li> Very emollient and a light nice smell.</li>
    <li> This is actually a reorder for me. The lotion is nice, and soaks in quickly. I live in the high desert, very dry here, and cheap watered down lotion will not work. This lotion works nicely, and in such a huge bottle- lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Only lotion we will purchase.  The whole house uses it.  Purchased one to try.  Was so taken with the quality that I purchased a gallon of the stuff to refill everyone&#x27;s bottles in the house!</li>
    <li> The original lotion smells the best, but if your skin gets a bit to dry like mine, you&#x27;ll want to use the extra dry formula. This lotion is GREAT for massages, its exactly like it says, very emollient! A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> The lotion used to be wonderful but I figured out why the new formula is so awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHEA BUTTER!  The problem with shea butter is like any butter once it goes through a refining process (i.e. cocoa butter, almond butter, etc.) preservatives are required to prevent them from going rancid. In that Hain is cutting costs you can be sure that they are not using high grade unrefined shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally shea butter does not go rancid but breaking down refined shea butter to a semi-liquid form requires using solvents and heat.  Thus the shea butter goes rancid and smell.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel and it is not scented a very good value.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great standard moisturizer. Does what it is supposed to do. Smells nice, isn&#x27;t sticky, smooth skin...</li>
    <li> love it! not greasy, not white, moisturizing.  will purchase again</li>
    <li> Love love love this lotion as I can&#x27;t leave it in the bathroom or my teenage sons use it all up!!!!!!I seriously just had to go and buy a new bottle yesterday and I paid 18$ for it at a health food store ...so getting 32oz.on Amazon is a steal from now on I will most definitely be ordering from here.on to the lotion I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this lotion I&#x27;ve been using it about 4 years now and its one of the best if not the best body lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried it has a fantastic scent to it and it keeps my SKIN so soft and moisturized until I shower again. Which to me says ALOT I&#x27;ve had body lotions in the past that I&#x27;ve applied directly out of the shower and a couple hours later It felt like I hadn&#x27;t applied anything.I see why both my boys love this so much it really works great and dosent smell feminine I wish I could describe the smell but u just can&#x27;t I guess to me It smells fresh??I don&#x27;t think anyone with dry skin who purchases this will be sorry.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! Even before I started buying it online. I have very dry skin and this lotion works to keep my skin nice and moisturized without a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Works very well, absorbs well &amp; is not greasy. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the smell but it is light &amp; does not linger.</li>
    <li> A wonderful lotion. I used to find it at Target but now it&#x27;s only hit or miss. It has an unassuming fragrance so it&#x27;s easy to wear anywhere and with your own cologne. At least, it is for me. It also works well into the skin and softens -- just like it says it will.</li>
    <li> I have been using Alba Botanica for about 8 years. Today&#x27;s improved formula is the best its been. It keeps you from drying out like some of the other brands. It also does not have a strong sent, so you can use it and still use perfume.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that people don&#x27;t like this scent!  It smells like Hawaiian tuberose.  I wanted to buy it after sampling it in Target because it smells so good, and finally caved and did it when I learned it&#x27;s paraben-free.  So silky and moisturizing, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky like some other lotions do.  Love it!  And this is a great value for the price; at Target, it&#x27;s $17.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb too quickly.  The best I&#x27;ve found for nighttime use since I have really dry skin.  No petroleum, which just further dries out the skin.  Original scent smells like faint papaya to me and is not too strong, but next time will try the unscented.</li>
    <li> Whole Foods sells this lotion for $40, and even though I LOVE it, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy it because it was so pricey. A friend mentioned that Amazon is amazing, which is true. It&#x27;s super thick and creamy! And you don&#x27;t need a lot of it for moisturizing!</li>
    <li> This product had a yellow tint and smelled like vegetable oil. It looked nothing like the picture and came wrapped in dusty, thick plastic that looked like it had been in storage???  At first I&#x27;d figured the batch had gone bad in storage, but according to the other reviews, it is the formula that has changed for the worse.  I do not like to complain, but I have an autistic son and have to search carefully for non-toxic products for him.  The change was very upsetting. Back to the drawing board.  Help me if you can recommend a product that was like the old Alba...or is the old Alba still available in stores?  I&#x27;d even given the company the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe they were using Amazon to get rid of an old experimental formula batch...#desperateimaginationstretch...</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s so thick and moisturizing without getting greasy. I would give the product 5 stars, but when I received mine, the pump was completely broken off the top :(</li>
    <li> I normally buy this lotion at the store but took a chance with this seller.  The lotion that arrived was old.  I could tell because it was discolored, extra thick, and had an old smell.  It was not like the lotion normally is.</li>
    <li> Even tho I started using this brand last year when a friend gave me a huge bottle of the bath &amp; shower gel, I hadn&#x27;t tried any of their other products. I then went on a trip and stayed with friends who used their shampoos/conditioners and this lotion and after a week of using it, I couldn&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t been doing so sooner. As a fan of Bronner&#x27;s, I don&#x27;t usually feel a need to try much else, but I&#x27;m glad I did because for years I&#x27;ve been looking for sunblock w/o oxybenzone and finally found that with Alba Botanica. This is when I started to do more research on the company, their labs, their customer reviews and learned how hard they work to keep things free of abrasive chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended. No parabens or no animal testing (this is a biggie for me).</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion many years ago through an advertisement and after using it I was so satisfied that I starated looking places to purchase it  I finally located through amazon and have continued to purchase it though amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion does such a good job of moisturing dry skin!</li>
    <li> 12/18/13 I just found some old notes I had on their OLD ingredients: Certified organic herbal infusion of Camomile, Echinacea, Green Tea, Lavender, Safflower Oil, Jojoba Oil, Sesame Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Avocado Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Certified organic Aloe Barbadensis, Glyceryl Stearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Cucumber Extract, Organic Sea Kelp Extract, Pro-Vitamin B5, Lecithin, Silica, Methyl/Proplyparaben, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vitamin E.  Compare this with their newer formula!&lt;br /&gt;This was my review from 5/09 when I used to buy the gallon size Very Emollient Body Lotion..&lt;br /&gt;I have been purchasing Alba in the gallon size for years. Unfortunately last year when I purchased more, I noticed I did not like it at all. When I compared the ingredients on the new bottle versus the older one, I noticed they cheapened the formula...water is now the #1 ingredient with safflower seed oil being #2 and vegetable glycerin being #3. The good ingredients like essential oils are much further down their list...so to save money they&#x27;ve replaced the essential oils w/more water and vegetable oils. I wrote to them months ago asking they bring back their old formula. They never responded. Not the kind of company I wish to purchase from any longer. It&#x27;s too bad, since they used to put out a quality product. I now use BWC brand lotions and am very happy w/them.&lt;br /&gt;11/26/11 I was curious if Alba ever went back to their original formula, but reading everyone&#x27;s more recent posts &amp; looking at the ingredient list, I see they haven&#x27;t ...that&#x27;s too bad. :(</li>
    <li> for anyone who suffers from dry skin, this lotion is by far the best I&#x27;ve found. Never have icthy,dry skin again</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the way it feels on my skin. I would recommend this lotion to anyone looking for a body moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too heavy, not greasy, and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Really like this lotion has a soft scent and is not a heavy moisturizer</li>
    <li> i think this lotion is totally great. one of the reviewers mentioned a bunch of chemicals that were added to this but i&#x27;m not sure where he/she is getting that, since the ingredients listed to not contain any of those items. i&#x27;ve been using this for years and think its fantastic!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite lotion for a many years now. I had been surrounded by it working for a natural foods market, and never tried it. But customers were crazy about it. Eventually I tried it, and I can&#x27;t find a replacement for it. Drug store lotions are usually not moisturizing enough, and cause my skin to break out, but this one is a keeper. It gets really dry during the winter months in Chicago, so I just use a shower oil to add extra moisture. This has a nice, light scent.</li>
    <li> I was a bit apprehensive ordering this Alba lotion since it has gotten numerous poor reviews.  But I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like this lotion after using it.  It is not greasy or oily at all, absorbs quickly, and hydrates my skin quite well.  There is a mild scent that isn&#x27;t obtrusive and doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I love that it is all vegetarian, cruelty-free, no parabens or phthalates.  This will be my daily-use lotion from now on.</li>
    <li> Best daily moisturizer! Non greasy, unscientific, perfect! Great value!</li>
    <li> Natural, non-sticky, not overly scented....perfect!</li>
    <li> best lotion there is.  sometimes I try to save money and switch but I always come back to Alba.</li>
    <li> We love this lotion and this company offers it at a good price. We would highly recommend it.  It is thick and rich feeling.</li>
    <li> So I had just bought this lotion when I looked it up and I was almost going to take it back. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t! The people who complained about the ingredients should take a chemistry class or better yet just google it lol. Anyway it smells great and feels amazing. Will definitely buy it again! Love the ease with the pump.</li>
    <li> Leaves my dry skin feel very smooth and is absorbed quickly without leaving any greasy film. I love the smell, it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, but not heavy and greasy.  Goes on smoothly.  I have sensitive facial skin and dry body skin and this can go on anywhere!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my legs every night and it helps keep them&lt;br /&gt;from drying out as I need to wear elastic hose.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on a daily basis for over 5 years, I re-ordered some from amazon only to receive it damaged ! The bottle came covered in lotion, and the pump won&#x27;t pop up so that it can be dispensed. I am curious if the product inside the bottle is what it is supposed to be, as it smells more like flowers than I remember.  I am severely disappointed!</li>
    <li> I guess this had been sitting around for a while for it was very thick and smelled awful. would not buy again</li>
    <li> i like the product but the packaging of the product is not done with very much care so be careful when ordering this product i have had lotion all over the place and some of the pumps were broken but the product is great</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, although I prefer the unscented variation</li>
    <li> Item was received promptly with no problems. Lotion very moisturizing and smooth. Total price was very affordable and may I say worth it...</li>
    <li> After finding out that St. Ives&#x27; parent company tests on animals, I had to find another daily body lotion. After browsing cruelty-free brands, I came across Alba. The big size of the bottle and the reasonable price sealed the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion smells great...musky and floral. It is also non-greasy and a little goes a long way. However, I feel like with the formula, in order to keep your skin really hydrated for 12 hours, you&#x27;d need to reapply (which is impossible if you&#x27;re out and about all day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase another bottle. If anyone knows of any other cruelty-free lotions that don&#x27;t break the bank, please share! :)</li>
    <li> This lotion is one of the best one&#x27;s I have purchased so far. Scent is great &amp; it really hydrates my dry skin during the winter.</li>
    <li> Not too fragrant and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 bottles of the Original at the beginning of the year and I put them away until I needed a new lotion. This was about 3 months from my initial purchase. Unfortunately I was sent 3 bottles of Unscented. I didn&#x27;t bother looking into exchanging it as it had been so long, but I really was quite disappointed. Other than that the consistency was that of what I&#x27;ve always purchased --- I was just looking forward to that slight scent that the original had.</li>
    <li> Light scent and very hydrating!</li>
    <li> Love Alba lotion.  Soaks in well without any residue, clean, moisturizes very well, natural ingredients.  My husband and kids use it all over (except face) and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have been happily enjoying Alba Botanica Original Very Emollient Body Lotion for many years. The light, natural fragrance and feeling on my skin are just perfect. It&#x27;s lovely to find it conveniently right at my door whenever I simply put in a quick order. My skin says, &amp;#34;Thank you!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Why fix it if it&#x27;s not broke?  Simply concept people.&lt;br /&gt;Origninal formal was changed and it is noticeably different for the worst.</li>
    <li> This is an all natural product with out the chemicals.  The product is light and not a heavy cream.  Very nice to apply to the whole body.  Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for over 5 years now and have never had any problems like the ones described in these reviews. My guess is, a couple of these folks may have received Alba&#x27;s body lotion wit SPF 15. That formula is definitely different from the original and the smell, well smells like sunblock. I too have tried BWC lotion as well. I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much as I like this product. If you can get this lotion in bulk at the Health Food Co-op, then it must be good!</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion, provides great moisture for dry and sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been recommending it to all of my friends and keep bottles at home and in the office.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have used. My daughter had some and I tried it feel in love with it. Found it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like it and its cheaper than at the store but still expensive.</li>
    <li> very emollient? more like very bad. crap. fillers. Just like all the rest, no better than JASON. turned corporate i guess, going down hill fast.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for several years.  It is not greasy and the smell is pleasant and not per-fumy or overpowering.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever. Not oily. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, but really hydrates my skin. I tried to buy something else when I finished my first bottle but immediately regretted it and bought another.</li>
