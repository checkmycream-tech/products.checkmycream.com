### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it&#x27;s the best nose trip that I have ever use.</li>
      <li>it works good!  </li>
      <li>good buy!</li>
      <li>I am so happy with this gift, and I&#x27;m defiantly buying more!!</li>
      <li>Not working very effectively.</li>
      <li>You just love to look at your nose all the time after use this!</li>
      <li>These are amazing, my nose hasn&#x27;t been clearer.</li>
      <li>Though these take a good amount of time to go through, they are much better than Biore strips.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I have to cut mine to make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
      <li>But maybe that&#x27;s just me. :)</li>
      <li>Step one opens them even more.</li>
      <li>Suspicious of  its authentication without strong evidence, so I will just give it the benefit of doubts.</li>
      <li>Step 2 is kind of like putting sticky tape on your face, but it really does pull the blackheads out!</li>
      <li>Amazingly, these really work if you give them some time.</li>
      <li>I suppose it was already fairly clean that day.  </li>
      <li>Then I used them again after a week of my regimen and WOW, it was amazing how much dirt came out of my pores.</li>
      <li>Felt nice, but not really any better than my old Biore strips.</li>
      <li>First time use this product.</li>
      <li>Step 3, you remove the clear plastic and one you have successfully placed the jelly like strip, you remove the 2nd piece of film, or else the jelly strip will not stay on your nose for the actual suggested amount of 10 minutes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I used this product, I did not have a whole lot come out from my nose-</li>
      <li>These work very well.</li>
      <li>Every step spend around 10 -15mins, so i have to control the time very carful.</li>
      <li>Product works way better than any other nose strip</li>
      <li>Really fast delivery, nicely packed and even threw in a small gift.  </li>
      <li>I noticed the difference immediately - not only did I see a bunch of blackhead gunk on the sticky tape from step 2, but after step 3, my nose looks noticeably better and overall</li>
      <li>, I guess the new ones come in.</li>
      <li>I pretty much have the squeeze the suckers to get them clean, or go to an aesthetician and have them do it.  </li>
      <li>I used a hot wet towel on my face first as someone else suggested, which does help your pores open up a bit.</li>
      <li>since I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Other nose trip brand do the job, but leave an open pore and doesn&#x27;t feel smooth like the pig nose.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase this again because the price is pretty high, but i definitely think it works much better than any other strips I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Step 2, you have to wet your nose with a little bit of warm water or the nose strip doesn&#x27;t stick properly.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell of the last step but since they really seem to be helping I would still order them again.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s having the extra steps that do the trick, but I was genuinely surprised.</li>

<li> I have black head that hard to get rid of.</li>
<li> But the 3rd piece smell bad.</li>
<li> I am in my late 30s (not yet 40, woo hoo!), and have always had oily skin and acne problems.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s fake,,,,, it&#x27;s not Holika Holika.</li>
<li> but not impressive as promoted..</li>
<li> it&#x27;s Fake!</li>
<li> I am so ANGRY about this product!</li>
<li> Even if they are fake, THEY WORK!!</li>
<li> I have blackhead on my nose and chin, but the nose ones are the worst.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First time use this product. Every time have to spend almost one hour to do this nose mask. Every step spend around 10 -15mins, so i have to control the time very carful. But anyway it works.</li>
    <li> These work very well. I like the 3 step way of doing the nose cleaning for removing blackheads. You prep the area then remove the blackheads with the second step (well remover the surface junk) and then the final step moisturizes and soothes the area. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell of the last step but since they really seem to be helping I would still order them again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OK. Not working very effectively.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fake,,,,, it&#x27;s not Holika Holika. It&#x27;s from China.......  DON&#x27;T BUY IT</li>
    <li> I am so ANGRY about this product! it&#x27;s Fake! It is different from the one I used before</li>
    <li> second time bought this, so disppointed this time, never buy again</li>
    <li> Really fast delivery, nicely packed and even threw in a small gift.  Satisfication 100%</li>
    <li> It works. But the 3rd piece smell bad.</li>
    <li> the second one did not work</li>
    <li> I saw these being sold individually and decided to give it a try after reading a review of the product on someone&#x27;s blog. I am in my late 30s (not yet 40, woo hoo!), and have always had oily skin and acne problems. I have blackhead on my nose and chin, but the nose ones are the worst. Overall my pores are small, which just means that Biore strips and similar products never work for me. I pretty much have the squeeze the suckers to get them clean, or go to an aesthetician and have them do it.  Perhaps it&#x27;s having the extra steps that do the trick, but I was genuinely surprised. I used a hot wet towel on my face first as someone else suggested, which does help your pores open up a bit. Step one opens them even more. Step 2 is kind of like putting sticky tape on your face, but it really does pull the blackheads out! And step 3 then closes your pores.  I noticed the difference immediately - not only did I see a bunch of blackhead gunk on the sticky tape from step 2, but after step 3, my nose looks noticeably better and overall the pores on my nose were smaller and less noticeable (and definitely cleaner).  I recently purchased a 10 pack of these things and plan to use one every other week or so. It is a little time consuming, but if you do the steps while watching tv or surfing the web or something, it&#x27;s not a big deal at all.</li>
    <li> it works good!  I used it twice a week and it did help me</li>
    <li> Though these take a good amount of time to go through, they are much better than Biore strips.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best nose trip that I have ever use. I have black head that hard to get rid of. Other nose trip brand do the job, but leave an open pore and doesn&#x27;t feel smooth like the pig nose. the only reason I gave 4 stars bcuz u have to reuse it after couple days, I guess the new ones come in. I was expected the result last longer....</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift, and reading the reviews might be worrying. Even if they are fake, THEY WORK!! These are amazing, my nose hasn&#x27;t been clearer. I am so happy with this gift, and I&#x27;m defiantly buying more!!</li>
    <li> it works on me......i like it....since I have sensitive skin but it won&#x27;t cause my skin break out.....good buy!</li>
    <li> Product works way better than any other nose strip product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Instructions are not accurate or too clear. Step 1, you leave on for 15 2 20 minutes. Step 2, you have to wet your nose with a little bit of warm water or the nose strip doesn&#x27;t stick properly. Step 3, you remove the clear plastic and one you have successfully placed the jelly like strip, you remove the 2nd piece of film, or else the jelly strip will not stay on your nose for the actual suggested amount of 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual nose strip (step 2) is smaller than the pore opener (step 1), which leaves some of your pores open and unmanaged... I have to cut mine to make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
    <li> When I used this product, I did not have a whole lot come out from my nose- I suppose it was already fairly clean that day.  However, when using it on my husband&#x27;s nose, the removal was substantial.  While these did not pull everything visible out of his pores, it pulled out A LOT!  So I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase this again because the price is pretty high, but i definitely think it works much better than any other strips I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Amazingly, these really work if you give them some time. I recently switched to a Korean 12 step skincare regimen, and used these at the start. Felt nice, but not really any better than my old Biore strips. Then I used them again after a week of my regimen and WOW, it was amazing how much dirt came out of my pores. Only downside is that the sticky pore strip is pink, not white, so it&#x27;s harder to see the gunk stuck to it afterward. But maybe that&#x27;s just me. :)</li>
    <li> Suspicious of  its authentication without strong evidence, so I will just give it the benefit of doubts. It works okay but not impressive as promoted..</li>
    <li> Just as what I wanted!</li>
    <li> dont buy it！it is fake！ my friend bought some from korea，the quality is totally different from this one！the one i bought it is not sticky at all.</li>
    <li> You just love to look at your nose all the time after use this!</li>
    <li> I think you only give me 1pc , I paid $21 for 10pc , This is a deception</li>
