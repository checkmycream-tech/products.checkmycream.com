      <li>It helps calm him nerves.</li>
      <li>so it is wise to just order one to try out first) with a couple other chewers.</li>

      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I loved the red material it was chewy enough to keep her interested in them.  </li>
      <li>The student has chewed holes in other chewys, but this one is very strong.  </li>
      <li>He has limited grasp function and tends to release most objects, but not the chewy tubes.  </li>
      <li>We loved it after using it about a month or 2 she hardly needed it at all anymore.  </li>
      <li>They are simple, easy to grasp and hold, easy to clean and this particular one is a little stronger for the older chewer, who has stronger teeth!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this Chewy Tube!</li>
      <li>This works really well for our daughter who needs to chew everything.</li>
      <li>The Tube itself is very well made and has really held up through all of the chewing.</li>

      <li>If you have a kiddo that needs to chew, I highly recommend trying these.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>When I tried to order 4 of the same exact chewy tube, the fees quadrupled!  </li>
      <li>It is really nice to have an acceptable alternative to offer her instead of &amp;#34;please don&#x27;t chew that.&amp;#34; I think it maybe a little too obvious for when she is mainstreamed in school</li>
      <li>These chewy tubes are very soft.  </li>
      <li>If I remember from the accompanying literature the large (blue) is for older chewers and may solve that issue.</li>
      <li>It became pretty constant with change or while watching a movie.  </li>
      <li>My daughter is 2 years old and chews on everything.</li>
      <li>It was well used, and survived months of chewing from my two year old (with teeth).</li>
      <li>My four year old calms right down when I give him this in a stressful moment.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My daughter is your typical 6 year old.  Get nervouse and start chewing/ sucking on something.  It became pretty constant with change or while watching a movie.  I loved the red material it was chewy enough to keep her interested in them.  So my friend suggested a chewy tube.  We loved it after using it about a month or 2 she hardly needed it at all anymore.  We keep it around incase there is something she needs to work out otherwise this is a perfect product for someone with just the slightest sensory issues.</li>
    <li> Like the yellow chewy tube, this is a great product.  It is quality all the way around and is great for any folks with oral motor issues that need proprioceptive feedback.  They are simple, easy to grasp and hold, easy to clean and this particular one is a little stronger for the older chewer, who has stronger teeth!  My son likes to hold this one on the short end and often mimics a pipe smoker.  He has limited grasp function and tends to release most objects, but not the chewy tubes.  It keeps him from his nail biting when available and helps with exercising his muscles in his mouth and cheeks to keep them toned as well.  Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> The Chewy Tube was excellent just like I&#x27;ve seen on you tube.  My daughter uses it for her Feeding Therapy &amp; it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> My son, 4, has an oral motor disability and needs to bite (a lot)!  This was a great item, but was easily misplaces because there isn&#x27;t an easy way to keep it on his person.  I ended up buying others that had a loop so I could tie a ribbon around it and put it around his neck like a necklace.  That worked much better.  I would have given it 5 stars if it were easier to carry around.</li>
    <li> This has been a perfect tool to help with mouth cleansing. She can bite down comfortably and the caregiver can clean her teeth more easily.</li>
    <li> I know these are therapeutic based items but they turned out to be perfect for my teething one year old. He will choose one of these over all the other baby tethers we have.</li>
    <li> These chewy tubes are very soft.  I brought them for my 3 y-old twin boys and within less than a week they chewed off the edges. I had to toss them. They would be best suited for 1 year olds with sensory issues.</li>
    <li> We purchased this for my son, who is 6, and has anxiety, after a recommendation from my friend. He used to chew on his hands, fingers, and anything else he could get his teeth on, but now he enjoys chewing on this toy. It helps calm him nerves. He said \\&quot;it feels like a finger\\&quot; which means it gives him good resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that I pictured the product to be bigger, so it is a bit difficult for him to hold on to at times. I&#x27;m sure it says the measurements somewhere, but I didn&#x27;t read it (my fault). It is only a few inches long.</li>
    <li> Our daughter has some sensory issues. One of the things she does is bite others, herself or objects when she gets frusterated. Her OT gave us this chewy tube for our daughter to bite on when she feels frusterated. She loves it! And randomly chews on it even when she does not \\&quot;need\\&quot; to. She still bites herself from time to time but much less now that she has the chewy tube. I got a bunch of them  for home and put them on pacifier clips. I keep one in the diaper bag, one in the kitchen, one in the nursery and one is clipped to our daughter&#x27;s shirt. So glad there are products like this out there!</li>
    <li> I am a special education teacher.  I purchased 2 of these for one of my students with autism.  It is great!  We put a soft piece of yarn through the top of the T and hang it around his neck.  The student has chewed holes in other chewys, but this one is very strong.  I highly recommend this product.  It was also what the Occupational Therapist at our school suggested to purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my son who has Autism. He likes to put everything in his mouth and taste and chew on it. The Chewy Tube has been a big help in letting him chew, and not worrying about what he has in his mouth. The Tube itself is very well made and has really held up through all of the chewing. I highly recommend this Chewy Tube!</li>
    <li> This item helped my son with making his jaw stronger since he had such a week bite. His speech instructor advised me to get this and with her help, it has worked wonders for him.</li>
    <li> This is for my son who like to chew on things. HE wore out the other ones. This were easy to order and work great. Im a happy and satisfied customer of this product. Will order again when these wear out.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to see the chewy tubes so reasonably priced despite the $6.50 S&amp;H fees.  When I tried to order 4 of the same exact chewy tube, the fees quadrupled!  Really?!?!  $26 dollars in S&amp;H fees for $4 worth of products!!!!  Absolute robbery!!!!  Disgusted with this company for taking advantage of people with disabilities.</li>
    <li> We received one of these from one of my child&#x27;s rehab therapists. It was well used, and survived months of chewing from my two year old (with teeth). After my son no longer needed it, it graduated to my teething infant and was well-loved until it disappeared on a trip. I&#x27;m ordering more now that I know they are on Amazon (whew)! I&#x27;m not sure why other reviewers have had difficulty with ends being chewed off. If I remember from the accompanying literature the large (blue) is for older chewers and may solve that issue.</li>
    <li> This works really well for our daughter who needs to chew everything. It is really nice to have an acceptable alternative to offer her instead of &amp;#34;please don&#x27;t chew that.&amp;#34; I think it maybe a little too obvious for when she is mainstreamed in school but there are other options for when that time comes. (She is four now). Our OT gave us one to try out (like any tool, some kids respond and some don&#x27;t...so it is wise to just order one to try out first) with a couple other chewers. This was a favorite (although she likes the yellow size best, I think). I ended up getting several so we can have some in each room. If you have a kiddo that needs to chew, I highly recommend trying these.</li>
    <li> I ordered the medium chewy tube thinking it would be a perfect size. Not too big, not too small. This was WAY smaller than I thought it would be. My daughter is 2 years old and chews on everything. So I figured a chewy would be good. The product itself is fine, it is durable and we have had no problems. It is hollow all the way through (like a straw). I would just have expected it to be bigger.</li>
    <li> Been needing these for my kiddos. They are excellent! This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> My special needs daughter&#x27;s therapist uses this in therapy and recommend we buy it to do her oral exercises at home.  We are very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> My four year old calms right down when I give him this in a stressful moment. He doesn&#x27;t even look for it (thankfully), so no problems like that darned binky.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with product....I would highly recommend for all children with sensory issues......Product also arrived very very quick.....</li>
