      <li>however now I LOVE putting lotion</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s okay...</li>
      <li>I love everything &#x27;St. Ives&#x27;</li>
      <li>how many times I reapplied the lotion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the lotion</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>Probably my favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>Love the St. Ives lotions.  </li>
      <li>I think I am now in love with this lotion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d like to address one more thing: the texture of this lotion.</li>
      <li>I would love to NEVER SEE &#x27;MADE IN CHINA&#x27;.</li>
      <li>and it still needed more lotion.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the reason we have 500 cereals to choose from, just more life&#x27;s complications.  </li>
      <li>I think I am now in love with this lotion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d like to address one more thing: the texture of this lotion.</li>
      <li>Mostly I can see an episode coming these days and can avoid being scratched but</li>
      <li>More than I can say for St Ives at this point.</li>
      <li>I will buy again as it keeps my skin healthy.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t handle how fragrant most products are so</li>
      <li>It just sits on top of it.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of love it/</li>
      <li>St. Ives should have known better than to have changed such a wonderful product and replaced it with this foul smelling stinch.</li>
      <li>Although I like the St. Ives line of products, I especially love the &amp;#34;Renewing&amp;#34; Body Lotion (i.e., the one with the blue label.)  </li>
      <li>I LOVED it and immediately bought a big bottle, also whenever I let my friends use it they all loved it too.</li>
      <li>I loved this product so much, I converted many people to it over the years.</li>
      <li>Good normal moisture lotion.  </li>
      <li>THe lotion is great, bfor some reason I thought the bottle was larger as the price was almost twice what you pay at Walmart.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was happy to find the subscribe and save price lower than anything local.</li>
      <li>It feels cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this.</li>
      <li>does a great job overall.</li>
      <li>I got a free sample of this lotion with their apricot scrub and threw it  in my purse.</li>
      <li>I used the old product over a decade - LOVED IT.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more perfumed but still good overall.</li>
      <li>Under $5 is a great price for this much lotion that even contains urea to help it really sink in.  </li>
      <li>Now that the company has sold out to mega-conglomerate Unilever, they have apparently taken a huge step backward, and no longer adhere to that noble and more progressive philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the new Collegen Elastin you will find more people giving it a one star rating with very candid reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Hundreds of people who were loyal fans of the old lotion</li>
      <li>It has a very mild (almost undetectable) fragrance that dissipates once the lotion is absorbed.</li>
      <li>I like the smell; not flowery, just clean.</li>
      <li>I will say that I never tried the old formula and maybe it was exceptionally amazing</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not everyone is allergic to it, but it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;m allergic to - and it gave me a good chemical burn.</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal customer to St. Ives Collegan Elastin body lotion for almost 20 years.</li>
      <li>I had been a loyal user of the Collagen Elastin lotion for 13 years.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re losing loyal customers over this change.</li>
      <li>I too have been a loyal customer of St.Ives for years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so upsetting because previous formulas were great.  </li>
      <li>Also, the climate where we are is dry so this is a good choice for us.</li>
      <li>Good for dry skin without leaving residue on skin.  </li>
      <li>Really good for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Fresh, mild fragrance that dissipates quickly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it does the trick when the air is dry and my skin needs relief after a good wash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve definitely noticed softer skin after using this lotion, and it soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my legs feeling slimy.</li>
      <li>So here&#x27;s my take...for whatever it is worth...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used this product when it was bought as a sample piece. It&#x27;s okay...I&#x27;m oily skinned and it does the trick when the air is dry and my skin needs relief after a good wash. USE SPARINGLY because a little goes thousands of miles! I used too much once and it had this weird dew-y feel on my body the whole day. Would use this in a skin emergency, not as a everyday product --personally. Smells kind of pleasant, but doesn&#x27;t kick you in the face. I enjoy this. I would agree with others that this product is a lot wetter than usual lotions but this might work for someone else.</li>
    <li> St. Ives had a real winner with the \\&quot;old\\&quot; formula (in the 18 oz rectangular bottle).  This?  It is supposed to be an \\&quot;improved formula\\&quot; but it is awful.  My skin was itchy the morning after using it because IT DOES NOT MOISTURIZE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the outcry is loud enough that St. Ives (Lever) will realize they&#x27;ve gone down the \\&quot;New Coke\\&quot; route and are losing customers.  I used the old product over a decade - LOVED IT.  Recommended it to everyone.  Now I tell all my friends to avoid it.</li>
    <li> If only I could give zero stars. A few months ago they changed to a, \\&quot;new and improved formula.\\&quot; My ass. I had been a loyal user of the Collagen Elastin lotion for 13 years. I loved this product so much, I converted many people to it over the years. My husband never used lotion, but once he tried the CE lotion he used it almost every day. Now I&#x27;m embarrassed that so many people, on my recommendation, will waste money on a product that does not work. I&#x27;m so dismayed with the new formula. I don&#x27;t know if there is a new cheap chemical on the market that has resulted in the incredibly diminished quality of this formerly superior product. I do know that I can not use it. I tried, I really did, but somehow it manages to be greasy and chalky at the same time. The old formula was thick and creamy, and the new formula is thin and liquid. It definitely does nothing close to moisturizing my skin. It just sits on top of it. I spent this weekend testing all of the lotions in my pharmacy and none of them even came close to the comfort that the old formula gave. But since the new formula is so horrible, I had to switch brands. I hope St Ives sees how poorly this new formula is received, realizes how many loyal customers they are losing and reverts back to the old one. I would gladly come back to them if they bring back the quality we are used to.</li>
    <li> Have used for many years and it was great and non greasy, but agree that the new formula is awful.  Still use though and it is just ok.  Have to say though that you can get this at Target or Walmart for 3.50 -4.99 a bottle so not sure how they are getting away with selling it here for 2-3x more??  Same size bottle too.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal customer to St. Ives Collegan Elastin body lotion for almost 20 years. I loved the lotion and never used anything else.  Now they&#x27;ve recently \\&quot;improved\\&quot; the formula,  and unfortunately, the term awful doesn&#x27;t begin to describe the new formula.  It&#x27;s greasy.  It leaves a waxy film residue.  It is not quick absorbing.  It is NOT moisturizing at all.  I used the new \\&quot;Improved formula\\&quot; for 3 days and then threw away the whole bottle, that&#x27;s how bad it was.  It&#x27;s so upsetting because previous formulas were great.  I wish St. Ives would just leave a good thing alone.  They&#x27;re losing loyal customers over this change.</li>
    <li> Was delivered earlier then expected. Great product.</li>
    <li> A large percentage of the contents cannot be used at the end of the bottle due to the poor design. Tired with fighting with  bottle after bottle.  Probably look elsewhere.  The product itself is good, design is wanting  .</li>
    <li> I picked up this lotion because I was looking for something cheap and that smelled good. I had never used this brand before so I don&#x27;t know what it was like before.&lt;br /&gt;I can say before this lotion I was pretty much anti lotion, hated putting it on, the feeling on my hands, etc. however now I LOVE putting lotion on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what this fragrance is but I LOVE it. I will be buying more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it absorbs fast, doesn&#x27;t take much time to dry, and within a day my skin is noticeably smoother!</li>
    <li> The ingredient list on Amazon (at the time of this writing) is incorrect. I&#x27;ve added the actual ingredients below. Besides substituting soybean oil for mineral oil (which may be the main reason the new formula is so much worse than the old awesome formula), more disturbingly they have added METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE which is causing an epidemic of skin allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone is allergic to it, but it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;m allergic to - and it gave me a good chemical burn. You can google METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE and EPIDEMIC to see for yourself. Or see the London Telegraph story on it here: bit.ly/13tENDI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;WATER, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) OIL, STEARIC ACID, CETYL ALCOHOL, UREA, HYDROLYZED COLLAGEN, HYDROLYZED ELASTIN, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER, DIMETHICONE, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, CARBOMER, PEG-100 STEARATE, FRAGRANCE, TRIETHANOLAMINE, BHT, PHENOXYETHANOL, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, DISODIUM EDTA.</li>
    <li> Smells so good. I love everything &#x27;St. Ives&#x27;</li>
    <li> Although I like the St. Ives line of products, I especially love the &amp;#34;Renewing&amp;#34; Body Lotion (i.e., the one with the blue label.)  I use it daily, and liberally, on my face and body -- and can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
    <li> If you loved the St Ives lotion like I have for years and years, you will be shocked when you use their \\&quot;New Improved\\&quot; lotion. It is horrible. You will  first notice the smell and feel of it. It fills like you need more in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t absorb at all.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves, I am not kidding, a feeling of immediatly needing to put lotion on.&lt;br /&gt;My hands started to itch after using this new crap. (I think because of the perfume).&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t tell a difference from any other major brand of lotion now. You could feel a big difference before.&lt;br /&gt;It costs more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look on St. Ives own site. For the new Collegen Elastin you will find more people giving it a one star rating with very candid reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Hundreds of people who were loyal fans of the old lotion don&#x27;t like this new stuff and have in fact said they will throw the new stuff away rather than&lt;br /&gt;use it.&lt;br /&gt;St. Ives must realize they have a problem because they put the big bottles where you get like 30 percent free out. The funny thing is with the old stuff you had to get to the store pretty early on when they offered the bigger bottles before. This time they are still after a month the shelves still are full of the big bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON\\&quot;T WASTE your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 25 year user of this lotion will not purchase a single new bottle of this crap. If you fill like the other reviewers and I do please speak out. Go to the St Ives site and demand that they do something to change their new product. Thanks for your time.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived already broken. The pump didn&#x27;t work and it spilled in the packaging. I had to throw the bottle away.</li>
    <li> It makes you skin feel smooth and it at least a day before you have to apply it again. All the other lotion i have used before i would have to do it a couple of time and it still needed more lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some bad reviews about this particular lotion but, I have to say, I love it.  I like the way it smells and feels.  St. Ives has been a favorite of mine for a looong time.</li>
    <li> I too have been a loyal customer of St.Ives for years. This new skin renewing lotion is HORRIBLE! My husband who never smells a thing if I wanted him too...made the comment... \\&quot;what is that awful smell?!!\\&quot; I thought it was just me. I threw the intire bottle in the garbage. St. Ives should have known better than to have changed such a wonderful product and replaced it with this foul smelling stinch.</li>
    <li> works well and nice feel. does a great job overall. I will buy again as it keeps my skin healthy.</li>
    <li> Had this in a small tube and used on my face. Just loved it! Really good for dry skin. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> St Ives Skin Renewing Body Lotion is easy to apply, has a good fragrence and it was selected by Dr. Oz</li>
    <li> It feels greasy after I put it on. This is probably because it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin immediately.  It feels like its been watered down. It doesn&#x27;t feel thick and rich like other lotions.  It feels cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Among the few St Ives product I have used, I would prefer Deep Restoring and Intensive Healing as they moisturised better than Skin Renewing. Skin Renewing smells like chewing gum. Deep Restoring smells the best.</li>
    <li> The only reason I give it one star is because the price. Amazon is usually a great place to purchase things for cheaper BUT not this. I went to target the very next day and saw it there for $4.75 NO JOKE! That is a LOT cheaper than $10.58! Love the lotion HATE the Price! WAY OVER CHARGED!!!!!!</li>
    <li> When we bought this earlier this year our price as prime members was less than $5.  We went to reorder today, and the price is now $14.99???  What gives?? I can still get this at my local big box for $4.89.  Even if Amazon is padding it to cover the prime shipping, and extra $10 seems completely out of line.  I&#x27;ll have to pay a lot closer attention to pricing out my purchases here.  Good lotion if under $5 - TERRIBLE value at $14.99.</li>
    <li> Good lotion at this end of the price spectrum.  I use it to mix with my more expensive lotions so they last longer.</li>
    <li> I love this body lotion, which is especially good for moisturizing after shaving my legs. It smells good, but not too strongly and applies smoothly and evenly. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed softer skin after using this lotion, and it soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my legs feeling slimy. Also, I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
    <li> I like St. Ives products and this one lives up to its reputation.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase in the future as it does its job.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  Good for dry skin without leaving residue on skin.  Excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> The product isn&#x27;t entirely bad; at first I used it on my entire body. While I didn&#x27;t have any problems with my chest and neck area, my legs and arms felt ridiculously dry no matter how many times I reapplied the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;While I will keep using it for my chest and neck, it&#x27;s safe to say I won&#x27;t be buying this again.  It&#x27;s cheap, but not worth it.</li>
    <li> Ingredients in the description are wrong as of this writing!  There is NO mineral oil in this - yay!  Absorbs quickly leaving skin very soft!  Under $5 is a great price for this much lotion that even contains urea to help it really sink in.  Fresh, mild fragrance that dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Urea, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Carbomer, PEG-100 Stearate, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, BHT, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the product all in all</li>
    <li> Love the St. Ives lotions.  They all seem to be consistently thick no matter what fragrance/type you get. I have loved every one I have tried and I believe I have tried them all!</li>
    <li> THe lotion is great, bfor some reason I thought the bottle was larger as the price was almost twice what you pay at Walmart. Live and learn, I guess.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s one of the few lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried that is adequately moisturizing but completely non-greasy.  I&#x27;ll even apply it on my face if I&#x27;m just too tired before bed to deal with multiple products.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feels good. Absorbs well and provides good hydration! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of love it/hate it reviews here and complaints about a formula change. I have a middle of the road view and can&#x27;t address the formula change since I&#x27;ve never used the lotion until a week ago. So here&#x27;s my take...for whatever it is worth...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t generally buy \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; lotions. There are a lot of ingredients I like to avoid and I gravitate towards brands that at least make an effort to use organic ingredients and skin/body friendly formulas. I came across this St. Ives Skin Renewing at my local grocery that was restructuring their store and had this on clearance for two bucks. The ingredient list is largely inoffensive and contains no parabens or pthalates and I was in the middle of a battle with prickly winter skin so I bought it. I&#x27;ve been using this almost daily for a week now and I am *so* close to absolutely loving this lotion. I&#x27;m not wild about the scent...it isn&#x27;t bad, but a little strong for me even though it does dissipate in an hour or so. This healed my winter bumps within 24 hours, something my slew of natural and organic lotions can&#x27;t seem to do unless I religiously slather it on twice daily. So, hooray...my legs have finally stopped itching. This lotion also leaves my skin BABY SOFT up to and including the keratosis pilaris bumps on my upper arms. The bumps are still there but are significantly less red looking and scaly feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this is all very wonderful but not ultimately what compelled me to write a review. I have a couple of cats. One of them has an annoying issue referred to as \\&quot;petting induced aggression\\&quot;. You&#x27;ll be sitting there with him in your lap, he&#x27;s purring while being loved on and then suddenly he turns into a flailing bunch of claws and teeth and your forearms are mincemeat. Mostly I can see an episode coming these days and can avoid being scratched but once in a while he still gets me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the point of this little story? Well, as I&#x27;ve gotten older (I&#x27;m 37) the little kitty scratches, even shallow ones, take longer and longer to heal and are more likely to scar. Our most recent session of \\&quot;hey mom, meet my claws\\&quot; ended with quite a few scratches on my forearms. This happened right about when I started using this new lotion. Now, just a few days later, the scratches have all but disappeared!!! There are some almost imperceptible red lines, but they are just about gone. In less than a week! This is absolutely unheard of for me and I will definitely keep this lotion around because it is clearly doing some good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to address one more thing: the texture of this lotion. It is a little thick, so if you slather this onto completely dry skin you&#x27;ll feel somewhat sticky. I put it on after I shower without drying off and then pat myself dry about 10 minutes later. This accomplishes two things: no stickyness and you use less lotion. I come out out of this perfectly soft and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Mere hours after writing this review I have to give an update. I think I am now in love with this lotion. I am a Pharmacy Technician and I mix sterile products in a cleanroom. Whenever I go into the cleanroom I have to scrub my hands and arms like a surgeon...past the elbows, harsh soap, etc. I had to do this TWICE today and my arms are STILL SOFT. My hands are somewhat dry because I wash my hands more frequently than I do my cleanroom scrubbing, but they are still in far better shape than they usually are. Love, love, love!!! Am upgrading from 4 stars to 5!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on... it only costs a couple of bucks. Maybe it will work this well for you, too.scratches, even shallow ones, take longer and longer to heal and are more likely to scar.

    <li> Probably my favorite lotion. I like the smell; not flowery, just clean. I like the texture; not greasy and not runny like some other brands. I use this every day after showering.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years and have always liked it.  Recently, I have had 2 bottles that are so thick that I can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle.  What do I do with it?  I don&#x27;t have the receipt and don&#x27;t remember where I bought it.  I don&#x27;t think I will be buying any more of it.</li>
    <li> wow! really! new and improved? i&#x27;ve been using this for 20 years...now i find myself looking for another product, doesnt abosrb well, and it leaves a horribe scent, bring back the old formula. i normally dont write reviews at all but this change upset me so much i had to say something, if i could i would give it 0 stars...</li>
    <li> I like this lotion. It&#x27;s a bit more perfumed but still good overall.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I&#x27;ve been looking for a body lotion with natural ingredients. Although this one uses \\&quot;natural moisturizers\\&quot;, that&#x27;s close enough. I am SOOOO glad that they took out the mineral oil that was used in the old formula, and replaced it with soybean oil (The ingredients list for this product is not current).  This lotion leaves my skin soft and moisturized until I shower the next day. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it still has a few ingredients that aren&#x27;t good for you, but they are toward the end of the ingredients list. It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion and while on the hands it leaves them soft.  It does not repair really dry hands though, if that is what you are looking for.  Good normal moisture lotion.  The fragrance does cause a burning sensation on really dry hands.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat picky when it comes to lotion texture and scent. This hit the mark on both features. Exceptionally moisturizing and a nice non-flowery, non-chemical scent. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used and loved St Ives lotions for decades because it is (WAS) the only one that had no perfume; which I HATE.  I cannot find any lotion that replaces St Ives; furious!  What&#x27;s the deal???  Everything has to have perfume.  It is now in dish washing  detergent, my dishes might love to smell like flowers and fruit, but I get sick to my stomach when I smell the &#x27;earth scents&#x27;.  Now I have no choice for lotion.  I noticed the change in the packaging, so I sniffed every choice at the store, ALL were terrible.  Get it together and give us the only lotion that WAS fragrance free. I AM REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO PERFUMED FOOD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using Suave now and I hate it too!  If I want perfume, I&#x27;ll choose my fragrance and use the amount I want... no thanks for your help and added cost to support your competition efforts.  That&#x27;s the reason we have 500 cereals to choose from, just more life&#x27;s complications.  5 NEGATIVE STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the new improved toilet tissue that leaves confetti all over my behind.&lt;br /&gt;China must be trying to cover up something.  Their imported landfill should be upsetting to the tree huggers. I would love to NEVER SEE &#x27;MADE IN CHINA&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Lotion has good consistency, not greasy, not thin, hands feel moisturized long after I&#x27;ve put the lotion on. Have been using St. Ives for at least 10 years, have gone back to other brands if they have been cheaper and always eventually end up picking up this one. Also, the climate where we are is dry so this is a good choice for us.</li>
    <li> It is a great lotion because it is not greasy and it smell good. I would recommend this product if you have dry hands.</li>
    <li> Great price for a huge bottle smell&#x27;s nice to.</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic! I&#x27;ve been using this for an all over body moisturizer for over 6 months and just love it! It has a very mild (almost undetectable) fragrance that dissipates once the lotion is absorbed. I can&#x27;t handle how fragrant most products are so this is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No residual greasy or oily feeling either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find the subscribe and save price lower than anything local.</li>
    <li> Smells divine! My hands felt softer after 2-3 uses. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this skin cream since 1989. This is one of the few non organic products I still use. Eventually  need to switch to an all organic product for health reasons. However, when I use this product after showering for almost 25 years to date, my skin is not dry nor does it look dry.</li>
    <li> Wow, I have to say I&#x27;m really surprised at how many people are so upset with this new lotion. I will say that I never tried the old formula and maybe it was exceptionally amazing but I guess I&#x27;ll never know. I got a free sample of this lotion with their apricot scrub and threw it  in my purse. I LOVED it and immediately bought a big bottle, also whenever I let my friends use it they all loved it too. I definitely don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s waxy or chalky and I feel moisturized all day when I use it. So maybe their trying to market to different customers or something but I really don&#x27;t get how anyone can say this is a bad product, especially considering the great price and GREAT smell.</li>
    <li> I am amazed that even after such a backlash of loyal customers saying this new formula SUCKS BIGTIME and we want our old formula back they still have not responded. This is right up there with \\&quot;new improved coke\\&quot; as far as all time bone headed moves. At least Coke eventually listened to their customers and changed back to the original formula their loyal customers knew and loved. More than I can say for St Ives at this point. I have stocked up on the old formula hoping it will hold me over until someone in charge at St Ives comes to their sences and changes back to the old formula we all know and love.</li>
    <li> Before I say what I think about this product, I have to talk about what others are saying.  At the time that I&#x27;m writing this review, most of the reviews on amazon are very very passionate letters describing how much they hate St. Ives new formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only have I not noticed a difference in the lotion, but I think it&#x27;s really really weird that so many people are this mad about it.  It&#x27;s a $4.00 bottle of lotion; I&#x27;ve never been this angered by something that cost $4.00 before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this lotion.  It feels nice to me and the bottle lasts for a while.  I&#x27;m still young and haven&#x27;t used this long enough to say it makes my skin look younger.  But it does feel soft.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever!  Spouse just turned 50, skin is almost perfect!  No wrinkles!  Has used for years!</li>
    <li> I can remember when St. Ives carried a &amp;#34;not tested on animals&amp;#34; notation on its packaging. Now that the company has sold out to mega-conglomerate Unilever, they have apparently taken a huge step backward, and no longer adhere to that noble and more progressive philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since no particular fragrance name is noted on the package, I wrongly assumed it would be relatively fragrance-free.  Only after I purchased and opened it did I discover that it has an obnoxious odor.  I will never again buy this brand.</li>
    <li> Wisconsin winters are no match for the healing properties of this product.  Pleasant smell is not overbearing. Can irritate the eyes, however, if you accidentally rub some into them.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite lotion. I have been using st ives for years and this is my go to type.</li>
