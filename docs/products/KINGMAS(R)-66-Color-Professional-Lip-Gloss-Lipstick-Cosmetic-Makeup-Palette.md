      <li>most colors not all but still was nice</li>
      <li>The colors r very appealing &amp; true to the shade once applied to your lips!</li>
      <li>but it functions more like a very lightly tinted lip /gloss/.</li>
      <li>Some of the lipsticks are more opaque than others.</li>
      <li>Love love love this product.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;) just need to apply more lip gloss than u need..</li>

      <li>My daughter love the colors</li>
      <li>and i love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also enjoying thsee lip gloss shades.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just getting into makeup a bit more and wanted a palette with a lot of colors to see what I can and can&#x27;t pull off.</li>
      <li>but it not they are more a bunch of lip glosses and the amount that you get in each one</li>
      <li>Love the color just wish it lasted</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this palet yet however I did think that it would be more of a lipstick quality</li>
      <li>but the colors are very nice and stay on lips very well 4 stars</li>
      <li>colors go on very smooth and easy.</li>
      <li>I just wish they had a palette with bright vibrant colors!</li>
      <li>and I really think this is a good buy.</li>
      <li>it was cheap, i thought i would give it a try...</li>
      <li>I rate this palette a five because it has such a great variety of colors to try.</li>
      <li>Overall a good selection, most are matte and some are shimmery or glittery.</li>
      <li>The variety is very nice but the amount of lip color is extremely tiny.  </li>
      <li>Great shipping took long abt a month</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say maybe 5 or 6 come out true to color.</li>
      <li>Two because the colors look cool.</li>
      <li>very nice to take on lone trip alone with other thank you</li>
      <li>Pretty colors!</li>
      <li>The colours really pop and it ships really quickly!</li>
      <li>I had tried a few colors and it looks great</li>
      <li>There is a huge assortment of colors in this kit, but they aren&#x27;t very long-wearing.  </li>
      <li>So, if you&#x27;re looking for a palette with vibrant colors, I would strongly advise you to move on.</li>
      <li>but it has not been worth it..</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for fun, colorful, pigmented lipgloss....</li>
      <li>but its worth it</li>
      <li>The lipsticks mix right into each other really good.</li>
      <li>BUT ITS OKAY AS YOU USE DIFFERENT ONES-NEATLY PACKED</li>
      <li>Or what exactly the debrieas is.</li>
      <li>For those who like to dabble in multiple lip colors this is item is okay.  </li>
      <li>My only problem was that you don&#x27;t get much lip gloss but other than that it offers great lip color choices!</li>
      <li>i would recommend this palette, it&#x27;s cheap, you will try on different colors, and you will find the color(s) that is right for you.</li>
      <li>Shipping was pretty fast.</li>
      <li>I love all of the colors I can choose from and how it is moist and long lasting..will buy again!</li>
      <li>is not that much.</li>
      <li>but what do you expect for such a cheap price?</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay in ur lips and get off fast.</li>
      <li>some of the colors are very pigmented.</li>
      <li>My daughter is very please</li>
      <li>The majority of the lipsticks have a cream sheen feel to them very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t  heavily pigmented but they make nice lipgloss.</li>
      <li>AND IF YOU TRAVEL IS EASY TO TAKE LONG.</li>
      <li>Great colors and quality only thing is that it is kinda small and not all colors are so opac.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s decent.</li>
      <li>I apply different colors to make different shades, so the shear is ok by me.</li>
      <li>Also most of the colors were either damaged with the film cover, or were forsome reason not full.</li>
      <li>very light on the lips ..not too heavy or greasy</li>
      <li>Blue make up lookes great on black and white film.</li>
      <li>More than half of these colors come out nearly clear.</li>
      <li>This arrived ten days earlier than expected, with which I was very pleased.</li>
      <li>Ok for a try,but not worth for daily use.</li>
      <li>The color is hard to pick and very light.</li>
      <li>I know from watching youtube reviews on the same palette by coastal scents, i went on amazon and seen that the palette looks exactly the same as coastal scents but much cheaper, so</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s really not good for longterm use or say if you have a favorite color among them.  </li>
      <li>No regrets!</li>
      <li>but in using it it&#x27;s more like a gloss because the colours are very dull.</li>
      <li>Gave it to my 5 year old enough said</li>
      <li>Shipping was much faster than expected, it comes from China so it could&#x27;ve taken over a month</li>
      <li>As other reviews have said, it can be pretty sheer in color.</li>
      <li>Exactly like the more expensive ones from coastal scents!</li>
      <li>But other than that, highly recommend!</li>
      <li>well, glittery!&lt;br /&gt;-Small enough to just barely slip in a purse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These lipsticks/glosses are not long lasting</li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t that many pale pinks, there are a lot of oranges and corals, very few purples.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Para las barbies o unas niñas para jugar esta bien</li>
    <li> it was cheap, i thought i would give it a try... but it has not been worth it..</li>
    <li> This lip gloss is very good jus wish I could have got more colors...Other than that I like and will buy and Recomend!</li>
    <li> Gave it to my 5 year old enough said</li>
    <li> This is literally THE worst palette i have ever bought. Colors are not pigmented at all, except for reds &amp; pinks. There is half a centimeter of lipstick actually in each container. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a palette with vibrant colors, I would strongly advise you to move on.</li>
    <li> The glosses aren&#x27;t sticky when applying. They are creamy and the ones with glitter I couldn&#x27;t feel. I think there&#x27;s only one that has sparkles in it and I use it as a &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; every color is well pigmented. So, you can get the desired color if you need it. I like the various colors and I really think this is a good buy. I mostly bought it because I like lipsticks, but I hate paying a lot. So, this way I could find out which ones I like and buy those individually or if I wanted to do costume makeup. These are good for that.</li>
    <li> For those who like to dabble in multiple lip colors this is item is okay.  Each color well is not deep at all so it&#x27;s really not good for longterm use or say if you have a favorite color among them.  They are nice and we received it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Love the color just wish it lasted</li>
    <li> Great for the price. As other reviews have said, it can be pretty sheer in color. I apply different colors to make different shades, so the shear is ok by me.</li>
    <li> some of the colors are very pigmented. I had excellent communication with the seller .</li>
    <li> My daughter is very please and I wold recommend this product. I&#x27;m also enjoying thsee lip gloss shades.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product I thought it was a lipstick but in using it it&#x27;s more like a gloss because the colours are very dull.</li>
    <li> everything you need is in this lip gloss lipstick palette. go for it if you&#x27;re a color lover. am happy i got it</li>
    <li> It is not very glossy but not smooth as your regular lipsticks</li>
    <li> Pretty colors! They are pigmented as well. Wish it was a lot bigger though. I had tried a few colors and it looks great</li>
    <li> Exactly like the more expensive ones from coastal scents! I put them side by side and they are the same product under different names. The glosses are high pigmented and yes, it is small, but you don&#x27;t require a lot of product to see the color (:</li>
    <li> Looks like tiny samples ..a squeeze of lipstick and lip gloss.I had to give to my  teen daughters Couldn&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> this is great for traevling i took this on a trip and i love it i&lt;br /&gt;like most colors not all but still was nice this is nice just to have&lt;br /&gt;and very nice to take on lone trip alone with other thank you</li>
    <li> There is a huge assortment of colors in this kit, but they aren&#x27;t very long-wearing.  It was a great price.</li>
    <li> Came on time&lt;br /&gt;Nice product for its price&lt;br /&gt;Really nice color palette</li>
    <li> This kit has pigmented colors in all shades. perfect for mixing and blending colors . Blue make up lookes great on black and white film.</li>
    <li> These are not opaque whatsoever and I was under the assumption that this was lip/stick/ but it functions more like a very lightly tinted lip /gloss/. Kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> The color is hard to pick and very light. It doesn&#x27;t stay in ur lips and get off fast. I will not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This arrived ten days earlier than expected, with which I was very pleased. The shipping went great. The product was in no way damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-HIGHLY pigmented colors&lt;br /&gt;-Lots of variety&lt;br /&gt;-The glittery colors are extremely... well, glittery!&lt;br /&gt;-Small enough to just barely slip in a purse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The pans of color are smaller than expected... about 5/6 the size of a dime.</li>
    <li> My only problem was that you don&#x27;t get much lip gloss but other than that it offers great lip color choices!</li>
    <li> I like this Palette. Colors are good and very nice pigment. I will definitely purchase again. Good buy for your money. colors go on very smooth and easy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my mother and she loves it. She uses it in her cosmetology classes and sometimes in herself.</li>
    <li> I love all of the colors I can choose from and how it is moist and long lasting..will buy again!</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good deal. These lipsticks/glosses are not long lasting and I didn&#x27;t expect them to be. I&#x27;m just getting into makeup a bit more and wanted a palette with a lot of colors to see what I can and can&#x27;t pull off. So it worked for me. You will need a lipstick brush, using your fingers doesn&#x27;t cut it with this formula. The texture is creamy, a bit tacky but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the colors in the picture don&#x27;t quite match up with what I received but still similar. There aren&#x27;t that many pale pinks, there are a lot of oranges and corals, very few purples. Overall a good selection, most are matte and some are shimmery or glittery. Shipping was much faster than expected, it comes from China so it could&#x27;ve taken over a month but I received my package in about 2 or 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this product, the quality isn&#x27;t amazing but what do you expect for such a cheap price? It&#x27;s decent. I recommend.</li>
    <li> excellent used for all occasions, gives a perfect finish</li>
    <li> This is terrible do not waste you money. There are 66 different shades but after you use them once they are empty.</li>
    <li> lovely colors.  Bought it as a gift. will definitely buy one for myself. a lip gloss for every mood and occasion</li>
    <li> They are smeling nasty</li>
    <li> Very good lip glosses &#x3D;) just need to apply more lip gloss than u need..but its worth it</li>
    <li> More than half of these colors come out nearly clear. If you&#x27;re looking for fun, colorful, pigmented lipgloss....this isn&#x27;t it. I&#x27;d say maybe 5 or 6 come out true to color.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. Great colors and quality only thing is that it is kinda small and not all colors are so opac. Some are a little less vibrant then what the color may seem to the eye. But other than that, highly recommend! Would purchase again</li>
    <li> NOT MUCH IN THE LITTLE CONTAINERS BUT ITS OKAY AS YOU USE DIFFERENT ONES-NEATLY PACKED AND IF YOU TRAVEL IS EASY TO TAKE LONG.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t  heavily pigmented but they make nice lipgloss. Great starter kit!</li>
    <li> The variety is very nice but the amount of lip color is extremely tiny.  I do not think I will buy this product again though.</li>
    <li> Ok for a try,but not worth for daily use.Quality little bit poor.</li>
    <li> Great shipping took long abt a month will order again had it a few months Colors really pop kinda</li>
    <li> I rate this palette a five because it has such a great variety of colors to try. There are a lot of good quality colors in this palette. They are all pigmented. Some of the lipsticks are more opaque than others. This palette is great for all skin tones. I know from watching youtube reviews on the same palette by coastal scents, i went on amazon and seen that the palette looks exactly the same as coastal scents but much cheaper, so i thought i&#x27;d give it a try and i must say i am impressed. There are some mac dupes in this lip palette like up the amp, candy yum yum, vegas Volt and a couple of others. I&#x27;ve tried on each of the lipsticks and glosses.  The majority of the lipsticks have a cream sheen feel to them very moisturizing. Some of the lipsticks have a frost finish. Some of the lip glosses appeared to be melted but they were still wearable. I can tell that at least one of the lip glosses is vasoline just from the scent and texture. The rest of the lipglosses had a gloss shine to them and were slightly pigmented. I didnt have any problem mixing the lipsticks together to create more beautiful colors. The lipsticks mix right into each other really good. Its actually easier than mixing two actual lipstick tubes that i wear together on my lips. Shipping was pretty fast. i would recommend this palette, it&#x27;s cheap, you will try on different colors, and you will find the color(s) that is right for you.</li>
    <li> My daughter love the colors</li>
    <li> Got these for my girlfriend who has recently gotten into makeup! She loves em! The colours really pop and it ships really quickly! No regrets! Try em out!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this palet yet however I did think that it would be more of a lipstick quality but it not they are more a bunch of lip glosses and the amount that you get in each one is not that much.</li>
    <li> I like it. The colors r very appealing &amp; true to the shade once applied to your lips! I just wish they had a palette with bright vibrant colors! Great Product though!</li>
    <li> fast shipping and wonderful range of colors</li>
    <li> i like this due to the color choice but it took 23 days to arrive, the lip glosses and lipsticks are smaller then expected. but the colors are very nice and stay on lips very well 4 stars</li>
    <li> I give two stars. One because it cane on time. Two because the colors look cool. However the case was broken when i opened it. Also most of the colors were either damaged with the film cover, or were forsome reason not full. And there is debries in the lip color itself. Didnt even use. Who knows ware this came from. Or what exactly the debrieas is.</li>
    <li> Love the colors ..very light on the lips ..not too heavy or greasy</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas.  She said it was perfect and she was very happy with it.</li>
