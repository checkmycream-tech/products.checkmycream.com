      <li>It heats quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the settings. It is a bit long; I am petite. I wish the curling iron was shorter.</li>
    <li> I use this item for very short soft delicate hair and I rarely have breakage! But you have to watch the temp settings as it does get very hot!!!</li>
    <li> I just love this curling iron. Have found it hard to find the very small irons which I am usto using. 3/8 works great for my short hair. The only down part is the handle you open is a bit high but am getting us to it.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product!  It shipped very quickly, and the product is top-notch!  Great quality!  I have a lot of trouble finding these 3/8 inch curling irons in stores &amp; so it is awesome to be able to find them online &amp; have it be such a sturdy, quality product! Even shipped with extra springs &amp; that is ALWAYS the part that goes out on curling irons for me!</li>
    <li> good Quality heats quickly. I love it!</li>
    <li> It was a gift they were very happy with it! Great curling iron.</li>
    <li> Hot Tools makes the curling irons I prefer to use. This particular size, is impossible to find in the beauty supply stores that I frequent. Thank you so much for making this appliance available.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I had to order this same curling iron because the 1st one went out in about a month and the 2nd one has done the same thing!!! It lasted just a lil over a month this time. What is the deal with this curling iron, I have another one just like it, different size tho, same brand and everything. I love these curling irons, I guess it&#x27;s the lil size of this one that it can&#x27;t hang with the heat of it. What gives I wonder???</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron.. I am tired of getting perms, so I decided to get a small curling iron to curl my hair.. I get the same results with this iron as the curl in a perm.. I just have to do it more often.. Worth it as a perm for my hair is over $60.00 every 3 Months..    I luv it.</li>
    <li> There is a reason why Hot Tools are used in salons. They are quality equipment. This was a great transaction. A very good price. I will be going back to this seller&#x27;s store again.</li>
    <li> Smaller barrel than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is right for a certain length hair and in certain areas.  I actually use this size &amp; a larger one.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. One of the best buy this year.</li>
    <li> This is a great curing iron. I like the multiple heat settings, which allow me to create a variation of curls depending on the kind of look I want that day.</li>
    <li> This iron overheated without warning and literally vaporized a section of hair 2&amp;#34; x 2&amp;#34; at the top of my hair.  I had no warning; I put the wand to my hair and it immediately turned the hair to ash!  The barrel got so hot, that the plastic tip melted on to the barrel.  I am just thankful that no skin came into contact with the barrel or I would have had an emergency room visit for third degree burns.  My husband immediately tossed the iron or I would have returned it for a manufacturer&#x27;s refund.  Do Not Buy This Brand of Iron!</li>
    <li> Awesome for those tight corkscrew curls.  It heats up quickly and the curls last a long time.</li>
    <li> love this . use it all the time the curls come out execellent . since i have short hair. go out and buy this item</li>
    <li> I got it for my wife, she used them before and is very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> It works just like advertised, very well. The best part was the extra lever spring that allowed me to repair the old version of the same iron! Now I have two!</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional tool and very easy to use. My first curling iron was in use for more than 15 years. This is my second purchase and I am very happy with the curling iron.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 3 weeks. So sad. It was the perfect size.</li>
    <li> I tried it on coarse hair, and the curls are so perfect ! I&#x27;m a professional and this tool had been on my wish list for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Love this pencil curler my hair is so short this gives curls some hope</li>
    <li> All three items met my expectations and am completely satisfied with the order.</li>
    <li> Love the product ... 1 of three already not working due to cord, seems to be a short! Will return for a new on and be back with 5 star rating! :)</li>
    <li> I have used the curling iron once or twice but only on low and it has been very very effective.</li>
    <li> Great for very short hair that still needs to be curled.  Iron gets nice and hot very quickly and stays hot for the duration of the curling!  This is a professional iron and has a nice long cord, adjustable heat control settings, and a comfortable handle.  Comes with extra spring clips, too.  I am a hairdresser and I have and use daily all Hot Tools irons, so does everyone I work with.  I have every size available, from the very large diameter to the smallest (this one the 3/8 inch).  They hold up for years even with heavy use.  When the springs get worn out all of the Hot Tools irons come with at least 2 extra springs so you can change them out.  In my opinion, Hot Tools customer service has always been nice to deal with should you ever need to contact them.</li>
    <li> I saw this same curling iron at the store for $20 more. Heats up right away. Spring is good and holds hair snugly. Would highly recommend this curling iron.</li>
    <li> I love this curler, I get small tight curls, cute afro kind of look. Heats up pretty fast :-) if you love curly hair, buy this curler, hot tools is amazing !</li>
    <li> this curler is the best... im able to get super tight curls in seconds with this iron. and its small enough that i can use it on children too!</li>
    <li> Great item because I wear my hair very short and I don&#x27;t have issues burning my scalp or fingers. heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> This tool is way fun to use. Like all the other \\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; I own, it works wonderfully. It heats up fast and works like a charm on all different type textured hair.I have curly hair and i use this tool to define my already tight curls. But all my other friends have thick straight hair, and they love how this tool makes their hair curl so fast and easily. I would recommend this iron to any one who is looking for a reliable tool that makes tight curls. And amazon had the best price.</li>
    <li> I just recently went from naturally long hair to a short pixie cut.  I have searched several stores in my neighborhood looking for this size curling iron and could not find one any where.  I was very happy that I was able to find this curling iron at a reasonable price.  I intend to have this tool for as long as possible!!</li>
    <li> This tool is small and easy to use. I love the control temperature because I can set the temperature for my short hair and can reduce the chance of burning my hair or my hand. Overall, it is convenient to carry and travel.</li>
    <li> Width between handle and thumb hold is way too wide for me.  I had one before and it burned out way too soon so I don&#x27;t think it is a really great curling iron but I do have a hard time finding one that is 3/8&amp;#34; as I need the small curling iron.</li>
    <li> I returned it. The wrong size was sent and I didn&#x27;t want to fool with ordering another one.  I bought one locally.</li>
    <li> I like this one but it don;t curl my whole  hair as good. I recommened people to try it out before buying it your self</li>
    <li> Great product!  Really long cord. Multi heat levels. Tiny barrel easily curls the my short cut. Heats up very&lt;br /&gt;quickly.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother to replace a small curling iron she once had.  She had issues finding the right size but this one is perfect for small curls!  She has short hair so it works great!</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better. I am enjoying my new curling irons.</li>
    <li> IF YOU WANT TIGHT, TINY, BOUNCY CURLS THIS CURLING IRON WOULD BE PREFECT FOR YOU. IT HEATS UP FAST, ITS VERY SMALL AND LOOKS SO NICE. I HAVE BOUGHT ALOT OF CURLING IRONS FROM BRAND NAME TO CHEAP ONE AND I DIDNT LIKE NOTHING. BUT IM VERY PICKY AND THIS PRODUCT HAVE EVERY THING I WANT IN A CURLING IRON AND LEFTED MY HAIR HOW I WANTTED TO LOOK. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I WOULD TELL EVERY1 &amp; ANY1 ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. BUY THIS PRODUCT NOW YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> The first one received had a defective sticky handle, so I returned it at my own expense for a replacement.  The second one was also the same, so I returned it for a refund; they supplied a free shipping label this time.  In the interim, I ordered and got one that was good from a different company.  I could tell right away that this one had newer packaging, so perhaps the 2 I got through Amazon/Bple were old ones that had deteriorated over time.</li>
    <li> All in the title. Perfect for that short hair around the edges. The extra spring really makes this a &amp;#34;keeper&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mother and she is very pleased. It was very difficult for her to find this size curling iron in the stores in here area. It was delivered to her promptly and she is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> perfect love the multiple heat settings, very quick to heat, holds heat well.  Long barrel makes it easy to work with long hair.  Yep recommend this one.  If you are looking for a 1/4&amp;#34; barrel --- here is the solution</li>
    <li> received promptly, great condition, packaged well, and reasonably priced.  I love this iron and it is the perfect sixe for creating tight ringlets!</li>
    <li> impossible to find in stores. only can purchase on line. with very short hair, need the tiny barrel... love that it heats up fast and temps get hot so only a couple seconds and its done.</li>
    <li> I like this curling iron.  It was hard to find one this small.  It heats good and holds the curls very good.</li>
    <li> This is a good curling iron; I have used this brand for many years. It would have been rated great except that the spring does occasionally pop out (after the warranty expires)and contrary to what the description says it is not easy to replace.  You cannot get fingers or tools in the opening to do the job. It is not worth the money to get it repaired professionally.  However, I still buy this product as it really does the job. It usually sells for #36 in beauty supply stores in my area so you save a lot buying on-line.  It is worth it in the long run. I haven&#x27;t found any other product that works as well as Hot Tools.  Just be aware of the  spring problem.</li>
    <li> This item works great. Received in perfect condition and on time.  It is difficult to find this size curling iron that heats well enough to curl very wavy short hair. Kudos to Hot Tools for remembering there are some that maintain Natural short hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent love love love.</li>
    <li> Performs as promised, is attractive, and heats rapidly. I am happy with the curling iron and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Curling iron is bulky and difficult to use.  Took many tries to get correct heat setting.  Curls do not last and barrel sticks to hair instead of slipping easily off barrel.</li>
    <li> Love this iron. Beware, do not use at highest setting or you will burn your hair.  Definitely Would buy again</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and does a fantastic job on the shorter hair around my face. Speedy shipping.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this curling iron.  Can&#x27;t be found in stores.  Not many people use irons this small.</li>
    <li> highly reccomend. This did wonders to my hair. My hair is not str8 but its not curly. Its not shiney and smooth but its not corse and dull. Its in the middle i guess you can say. Package arrived in 2 days. I used it yesterday &amp; i was extremely impressed. I didnt replace my old curling wand because it works great too. I got this one because i needed a smaller size. This will give you extremely ghing tight small curls. I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Took it on a cruise already</li>
    <li> I bought this a gift for one of my friends and she said she loved it as well. :) Such a Quality Product</li>
    <li> This iron gets hot enough to curl your toughest grey haired customers so tight they will think they had a blue rod perm!</li>
    <li> I never realized that there was a curling iron with temperature control - what a difference it makes!  There are directions on how to set the various temperatures for the type of curl you are looking for.  I will definitely look at Hot Tools products the next time I need something.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!! It works fear fast heat up and perfect curels! Hands down best curler I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair and I use this just to clean it. It works great and I love how it heats up fast and works great every time. My old one had the spring break so I do recommend buying these one amazon rather than double the price in a store.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for as I have short, short hair that is straight, straight! This changes that.</li>
    <li> Works very well on short hair.</li>
    <li> It curls really well. Fine haired people need to be careful of frizz.</li>
    <li> I have used this product only twice so far on a low setting, it seems to burn the ends of my hair each time that I have used it. I have very fine hair, so I would not recommend it to someone with fine hair.</li>
    <li> These curling iron does get hot and curl very short hair well.</li>
    <li> Hot Tools HT1138 Micro Mini Professional... Gold Curling Iron, 0.38 Inch. This product is a pretty good micro curling iron. It is becoming harder and harder to find them in retail stores. The curling iron produces tight curls, has a knob for setting the temperature on the side and can be adjusted to 430 degrees. You will be able to get close to the hair shaft. This can be a good thing if you have short or ethnic hair. In addition, if you have natural or chemically treated hair, please make sure you use a hair protectant to help minimize the damage from the heat. Chemically relaxed hair requires less heat then non chemically relaxed hair in most cases. Buying this micro curling iron will truly save you money compared to what a trip to the salon would cost. The curling barrel diameter is smaller then what is shown in the Hot Tools HT1138 Micro Mini Professional...  picture and it is pretty long.</li>
    <li> Unless you dont mind burning your fingers I wouldnt recommend this type of iron, Get the one with the comb built in</li>
    <li> This is the only curling iron of this size I could find!  It is easy to use on the very short ends that refuse to blend into longer hair at the nape of the neck.  My only complaint is that it keeps sliding off the slick surface of my vanity counter.  I wish it came with some kind of secure base or holder while in use, and I also wish it had an automatic shut-off.  It heats quickly.</li>
    <li> I own a salon, the description was accurate so I got just what I wanted. I&#x27;ve used this iron daily for almost a month , it hasn&#x27;t let me down yet. The build quality is good, I&#x27;m sure it will last me for years to come.</li>
    <li> Product was above expectations. Have bought similar products from Sally&#x27;s and they always&lt;br /&gt;broke within 3 months. Love the heat settings and the ease of using it to curl my hair, it gives&lt;br /&gt;me the results that I am looking for. Glad I bought two and will buy this product again</li>
    <li> Nice gift she needed it and loves it.</li>
    <li> HT1138 Micro Mini curling irons stopped working after the first use and I returned them. I am searching for another brand in this size.</li>
    <li> I have one customer I use this on and it works better then any other size iron, never thought I would ever use such a small iron.</li>
    <li> Great tool, make curls tight or after curling run fingers through curls to loosen up, holds well when sprayed. Even heat , great product.</li>
