      <li>It has made my nails stronger and they are looking good.  </li>
      <li>Loved this product.  </li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>On days where I don&#x27;t have time to go the whole nine yards, I just swipe a layer of this on and my nails are hydrated and look beautiful.</li>
      <li>When used according to the directions, it strengthens nails and makes them look so much better.  </li>
      <li>I wouldnt suggest using it with out a top coat.</li>
      <li>OK, so I&#x27;m a guy</li>
      <li>I prefer my rejuvacote better bc</li>

      <li>It also drys very fast.</li>
      <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>My sister started using this product and within 3 weeks you could see a real difference in her nails!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use nail polish or anything else on top of the ridge filler but, once on and dry, a gentle touch up with a very fine polishing board smooths the finish out and it lasts for a long time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used it in a pinch to create a matte look on finished looks, which turns out well enough for someone who&#x27;s to cheap to splurge on a matte topcoat. ^_^;</li>
      <li>fast service.</li>

      <li>While it looks yellow-ish in the bottle, it applies relatively clear so it can be used for \\&quot;nude\\&quot; nails.</li>
      <li>Not only does it keep my nails intact, but it keeps my color from chipping much longer than OPI&#x27;s Nail Envy.</li>

    <li> Loved this product.  It has made my nails stronger and they are looking good.  Good price excellent product.  Above ex[ectations.</li>
    <li> Great product. fast service.</li>
    <li> Hello, I just wanted to give my 2 cents on this ridge filler. Not only does it fill ridges well and leave a smooth base for nail polish apllication. It also drys matte , yes a flat matte off white color. which is kinda neet.I think this helps the polish stick to the nail better. Plus it helps keep nail tips looking whiter and not so dingy. But using non-acetone nail polish helps that too. It also drys very fast. Do I recamend this product? Yes! The price is fair and it works well. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> This product is a necessary part of the Nail Tek treatment.  It fills in ridges and helps the Nail Tek Intensive Therapy to adhere to the nail.</li>
    <li> Overall I think it&#x27;s ok. I sometimes use this along with Duri Rejuvacote nail hardener to strengthen my nails as they grow. I find that it gives a very dry matte look and feels grainy on the nails. I prefer my rejuvacote better bc it has helped my peeling weak nails grow to a length I could never achieve before. I guess for a man this would be great as it has no shine. I prefer a glossy shine on my nails.</li>
    <li> When I was looking for a base coat, I wanted something that would keep my nails from peeling under my manicures. This stuff does the trick! Not only does it keep my nails intact, but it keeps my color from chipping much longer than OPI&#x27;s Nail Envy. It dries matte and a bit rough so color coats really stick to it. While it looks yellow-ish in the bottle, it applies relatively clear so it can be used for \\&quot;nude\\&quot; nails. I apply this about once a week to my nails in a thicker coat, and what an improvement it&#x27;s made! I&#x27;ve also used it in a pinch to create a matte look on finished looks, which turns out well enough for someone who&#x27;s to cheap to splurge on a matte topcoat. ^_^;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this basecoat for over 2 years and it does a great job of keeping my nail polish intact. I didn&#x27;t realize this until I ran out and stopped using it. My nail polish chipped within two days. This basecoat definitely extends the life of my manicure and is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This product was used by my former manicurist and I purchased it from her. My nails are weak, brittle and break easily. This product has strengthen my nails which allows them to grow. I done use clear fingernail polish I only use this product. It gives my nails the same glow and double to protection. Yes, I recommend this polish for more then one reason.</li>
    <li> Excellent product prefect for a base coat and my nails are all ridged and this covers pretty well.  I also have another NailTek product that is a nail strengthener and the two work great together.  I actually have nails again, not all broken and messy.</li>
    <li> Again, can&#x27;t go wrong with NailTek.</li>
    <li> My nails are thin, ridged and long.  I used 1 coat of this under polish.  It started peeling after 3 days, taking tiny chips off the tips of two of my nails with it.  Then my hand slipped opening a drawer and 2 months of growth snapped off my middle-finger nail.  I will never use this again.</li>
    <li> My sister started using this product and within 3 weeks you could see a real difference in her nails! I would reccommend this to anyone that has paper thin nails!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else but these made my nails beautiful. They provide a smooth and sticky base for nail polish. I find that my polish don&#x27;t chip as easily as they used to and do not peel off as easily. On days where I don&#x27;t have time to go the whole nine yards, I just swipe a layer of this on and my nails are hydrated and look beautiful. It&#x27;s also great for hiding discolored nails.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome base coat. Helps to keep the polish on. I wouldnt suggest using it with out a top coat. It has a rough feeling to it. So I use it under my polish.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  When used according to the directions, it strengthens nails and makes them look so much better.  I send it to friends now when they complain about split and broken nails.</li>
    <li> Great as a base! Best product I&#x27;ve used so far. This is my second purchase &amp; will definitely buy more when it finishes. Keeps my nail polish chip free for at least a full week! I took off a point because I dropped the bottle and it shattered :(</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product, I have very thin, weak nails and after using this product my nails are stronger and look so much healthier!!!</li>
    <li> one of the best base coat for nails. a little goes a long way. i highly recommend this to those who wants healthy nails and everlasting polish. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> OK, so I&#x27;m a guy but I do use this filler on my thumb nails which have very deep, and rough ridges, which I hate! I don&#x27;t use nail polish or anything else on top of the ridge filler but, once on and dry, a gentle touch up with a very fine polishing board smooths the finish out and it lasts for a long time. The slower the nails grow, the longer it lasts of course. I have been using it for a few years and would recommend it, even for the guys!</li>
    <li> I like and order as i have seen on the picture and when i got the item is different from what i order.</li>
    <li> I have never had good nails, mostly because they&#x27;ve always been thin, but also I have liver problems.  Despite those problems, I now have 10 perfect sassy nails!</li>
