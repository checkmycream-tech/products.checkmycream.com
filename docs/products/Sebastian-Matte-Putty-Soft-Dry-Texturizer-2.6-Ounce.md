      <li>I have short hair and this is the best product for mold it.</li>
      <li>and I have to say &amp;#34;I Love It&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Enjoy it!</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used gel to treat my medium length hair for years but after some researching, i found this brand, ordered it- and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>:).  </li>
      <li>I like this product and the end results, but much more is needed to have any effect.</li>
      <li>but the putty resembles foam more than putty.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I need to work with it more and see what looks I can get with it.  </li>
      <li>I would gladly recommend this product to my friends &amp; family.  </li>
      <li>This product will require a good glob at the end of your finger instead of the teeny amount that you use with most matte pastes, so you&#x27;ll use it up quicker, but I really like it.  </li>
      <li>Non greasey, light weight, love it.</li>
      <li>Because of the good reviews, the name description and reasonable price, I ordered Sebastian Matte Putty</li>
      <li>Easy to use,</li>
      <li>so it is easy to style and keep out of my face.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair look great -- enough hold to get a textured look, but still moves.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit too light for me</li>
      <li>I liked it because just a dab was needed and hair looked tousled without having too much separation.  </li>
      <li>This has a matte finish that controls the frizz and has a light hold.</li>
      <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this putty might resemble that original formula.  </li>
      <li>Good control without making your hair gross or sticky or crunchy.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad product.</li>
      <li>I have pretty fine hair, so I like a product that will give my hair some bulk and volume.</li>
      <li>Perfect for times when I need just enough hold to keep it all in place, but not so strong that it creates a hard, spiky crown.</li>
      <li>Makes my life easier to order this online with the other things; this product is very nice and works well; I was looking to replace it but would have had to make a special trip to a salon; this was far easier to order online.</li>
      <li>The original was true \\&quot;putty\\&quot; having the consistency of soft taffy.  </li>
      <li>No weird shine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i think there is too  much chmical in it ..  </li>
      <li>I really like the look, feel, and texturizing of this.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t like spiking it straight up</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t believe anyone likes this.</li>
      <li>just what I wanted to rough up the top of my hair when i have it in a pony.</li>
      <li>However, the Sebastian Molding Mud Remoldable-fiber Sculptor works better for my hair (basically straight hair with slight wave and frizz during rainy weather).</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong if you are looking for something that gives your hair great texture without making it sticky....</li>
      <li>I love using this after I curl my hair as it keeps it from looking too stiff</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight, limp hair</li>
      <li>Soft stylisher product!</li>
      <li>I was using pomade and other gels but always found that my hair ended up looking super greasy and shiny.</li>
      <li>Wife thought I was going for a look of a &amp;#34;70 year old distinguished gentleman&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>online, only to discover it is very cream-like.  </li>
      <li>When it dries it gives a natural look, not shiny or crunchy.</li>
      <li>...just need to remember that too much leaves a white residue that makes one&#x27;s hair look a bit white/gray.  </li>
      <li>This is similar to sculpting clay but much softer and lighter.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy with a natural finish.</li>
      <li>so I use this to add texture and get some hold while leaving my hair pliable and natural looking.</li>
      <li>..... I have fine short hair and this product gives it alot of texture without weighing it down.  </li>
      <li>I alternate between this and American Crew Fiber, depending on my mood and the weather, but lately I&#x27;ve been using more of this.</li>
      <li>but sadly it is not dry, or matte.</li>
      <li>I get this is considered a soft dry texturizer</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a product that will give a little volume with very flexible hold, this product will work well for you.</li>

<li> I get this is considered a soft dry texturizer</li>
<li> If you are looking for a product that will give a little volume with very flexible hold, this product will work well for you.</li>
<li> I work in an environment that is very dusty and by the end of the day most products tend to let the dust settle and stay in my hair.  </li>
<li> Alterna&#x27;s new version works well, but it&#x27;s less putty-like and smells</li>
<li> I used to use Sebastian&#x27;s Crude Clay, but sadly it is no longer available.  </li>
<li> This will last for a long time!</li>
<li> I like to use a tiny bit even when I am letting my hair air dry</li>
<li> I tried this product several different ways in several different amounts and the over all effect was always  &amp;#34;week of camping, no shower.&amp;#34; As such, no better than the cheapest drug store putty/wax/ texturizer.</li>
<li> One jar lasted a long, long time.  </li>
<li> Well, I hate calling her my &amp;#34;stylist&amp;#34; since I just get haircuts, but it&#x27;s a salon where I pay a little too much for a much better haircut than the cheapo places around here.</li>
<li> I was hoping to find some texturizer that didn&#x27;t make my hair an oil slick - the name &amp;#34;Matte Putty, Soft Dry Texturizer&amp;#34; gave me hope</li>
<li> No issue...just wiped away the excess and took note to use less product next time.  </li>
<li> This product provides a little less volume than what I normally prefer (I usually use Aquage transforming paste), but overall I like it.</li>
<li> so it is hard to find a product that is not heavy.</li>
<li> i put a dime size amount through my thick unruly hair and it makes it soft yet keeps it in shape.</li>
<li> this stuff are no good for american african also - DONT USE IT!</li>
<li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
<li> I found was that this gave my hair that \\&quot;crusty\\&quot; gel texture that I wasn&#x27;t really looking for - maybe I&#x27;m applying it wrong</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not super shiny</li>
<li> simply because I have very thick, course hair.</li>
<li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve got thin *and* thinning hair, and this stuff is lightweight while providing just enough hold without being too greasy.</li>
<li> but it does make hair greasy looking, even in small amounts.</li>
<li> You need to rub a small amount of texturizer in your hands before putting on your hair or it will look clumpy.  </li>
<li> It provides plenty of hold and shapping once applied without the thick clumpiness of clay.  </li>
<li> Bad if you have the habit of playing with your hair throughout the day.</li>

    <li> It makes your hair look great -- enough hold to get a textured look, but still moves. Bad if you have the habit of playing with your hair throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I get this is considered a soft dry texturizer but the putty resembles foam more than putty. I used it once and have thrown it away. Definitely not worth the money. Stick with TIGI Bedhead, Bumble and Bumble Sumotech, or Gatsby Mat Type Styling Wax.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a replacement putty ever since Alterna reformulated their hemp putty.  The original was true \\&quot;putty\\&quot; having the consistency of soft taffy.  I liked it because just a dab was needed and hair looked tousled without having too much separation.  It didn&#x27;t feel or look greasy.  One jar lasted a long, long time.  Alterna&#x27;s new version works well, but it&#x27;s less putty-like and smells bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this putty might resemble that original formula.  Because of the good reviews, the name description and reasonable price, I ordered Sebastian Matte Putty online, only to discover it is very cream-like.  Nothing \\&quot;putty\\&quot; about it.  I like this product and the end results, but much more is needed to have any effect.</li>
    <li> it is good. i like it because it helps to style my hair .!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think there is too  much chmical in it ..  i kinda lose hair !</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair which frizzes up in this Florida weather. I was using pomade and other gels but always found that my hair ended up looking super greasy and shiny. This has a matte finish that controls the frizz and has a light hold. Love it.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product. However, the Sebastian Molding Mud Remoldable-fiber Sculptor works better for my hair (basically straight hair with slight wave and frizz during rainy weather). Sometimes I mix and rub in both products depending on weather.</li>
    <li> Well, I hate calling her my &amp;#34;stylist&amp;#34; since I just get haircuts, but it&#x27;s a salon where I pay a little too much for a much better haircut than the cheapo places around here.

    <li> An easy and honest review. I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve always used gel to treat my medium length hair for years but after some researching, i found this brand, ordered it- and fell in love with it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product will require a good glob at the end of your finger instead of the teeny amount that you use with most matte pastes, so you&#x27;ll use it up quicker, but I really like it.  Good control without making your hair gross or sticky or crunchy.  No weird shine.  For the price... it&#x27;s solid, pick it up and avoid helmet-hair.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  I really can&#x27;t believe anyone likes this.</li>
    <li> Makes my life easier to order this online with the other things; this product is very nice and works well; I was looking to replace it but would have had to make a special trip to a salon; this was far easier to order online.</li>
    <li> I have a mohawk but I don&#x27;t like spiking it straight up so I use this to add texture and get some hold while leaving my hair pliable and natural looking. I like to use a tiny bit even when I am letting my hair air dry so it is easy to style and keep out of my face. This gives a great matte finish and isn&#x27;t greasy or oily at all. This also works well for keeping the short hair on the sides of my hair under c9ontrol and not sticking out every which way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. i put a dime size amount through my thick unruly hair and it makes it soft yet keeps it in shape. I love using this after I curl my hair as it keeps it from looking too stiff but once again keeps it in line. I will be buying this when mine runs out</li>
    <li> light and matte - perfect. just what I wanted to rough up the top of my hair when i have it in a pony.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Tried on a recommendation from friend.  Love it.  This will last for a long time!</li>
    <li> You need to rub a small amount of texturizer in your hands before putting on your hair or it will look clumpy.  I thought it would do a better job of making my hair look tosseled.  I need to work with it more and see what looks I can get with it.  Does not leave any shine to your hair.</li>
    <li> Soft stylisher product! Easy to use, practical results, amazing look! That&#x27;s a great idea to have one of this at home! Enjoy it!</li>
    <li> I used to use Sebastian&#x27;s Crude Clay, but sadly it is no longer available.  So I decided to give this product a try and I have to say &amp;#34;I Love It&amp;#34;..... I have fine short hair and this product gives it alot of texture without weighing it down.  I work in an environment that is very dusty and by the end of the day most products tend to let the dust settle and stay in my hair.  This product doesn&#x27;t do that.  I would gladly recommend this product to my friends &amp; family.  You can&#x27;t go wrong if you are looking for something that gives your hair great texture without making it sticky....</li>
    <li> I was looking around for a hair putty/pomade that would give me a matte finish but flexibility and pliability, so I gave this a shot based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was that this gave my hair that \\&quot;crusty\\&quot; gel texture that I wasn&#x27;t really looking for - maybe I&#x27;m applying it wrong but I could never get this stuff to give me that \\&quot;flexibly\\&quot; or \\&quot;malleable\\&quot; putty feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this if you are looking for a more pliable hold without the crusty feel:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001H3OYRE Healthy Sexy Hair Cocoa Paste]]</li>
    <li> This product is great for a light hold &amp; non greasy feel. It&#x27;s a bit too light for me simply because I have very thick, course hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for times when I need just enough hold to keep it all in place, but not so strong that it creates a hard, spiky crown. Love it!</li>
    <li> what it does? dont see a different? i can use something else… styling gel… something cheaper that do the same trick. this stuff are no good for american african also - DONT USE IT! - white matte</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find some texturizer that didn&#x27;t make my hair an oil slick - the name &amp;#34;Matte Putty, Soft Dry Texturizer&amp;#34; gave me hope but sadly it is not dry, or matte. It&#x27;s not super shiny but it does make hair greasy looking, even in small amounts. I tried this product several different ways in several different amounts and the over all effect was always  &amp;#34;week of camping, no shower.&amp;#34; As such, no better than the cheapest drug store putty/wax/ texturizer.</li>
    <li> Great putty for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great value...really good hold.  Works well...just need to remember that too much leaves a white residue that makes one&#x27;s hair look a bit white/gray.  Wife thought I was going for a look of a &amp;#34;70 year old distinguished gentleman&amp;#34; one morning. :).  No issue...just wiped away the excess and took note to use less product next time.  I really like the look, feel, and texturizing of this.</li>
    <li> Non greasey, light weight, love it. I have fine, straight, limp hair so it is hard to find a product that is not heavy. I have short layered hair and it stays in place with this product.</li>
    <li> This is similar to sculpting clay but much softer and lighter.  It provides plenty of hold and shapping once applied without the thick clumpiness of clay.  When it dries it gives a natural look, not shiny or crunchy.</li>
    <li> Cost of the good price~!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Rio de Janeiro and I always buy this texture. I have short hair and this is the best product for mold it. It&#x27;s creamy with a natural finish.</li>
    <li> I have pretty fine hair, so I like a product that will give my hair some bulk and volume. This product provides a little less volume than what I normally prefer (I usually use Aquage transforming paste), but overall I like it. If you are looking for a product that will give a little volume with very flexible hold, this product will work well for you.</li>
