    <li> I just got my kit and the pot leaf machine was not there, nor were the adjusting tools as the description said and pictures showed. Also the quality of the steel tips is less than expected and not what was shown. All and all I&#x27;m very disappointed do to the fact all of what I paid for was not there. I will say the machines I did get are a little better quality than I had expected. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend any1 wit experience order this kit. You will b just as disappointed as I am. Been doin tattoos for about 5 years, not exactly a pro but far from novice.</li>
    <li> The machines themselves were a bit heavy for me and alot of the ink had dried up before i got them. A little over a third of them were useless. Not sure if I&#x27;ll order again</li>
    <li> the tattoo guns do not work the needles are bad  and bent the ink is very bad I have way too many unhappy customers</li>
    <li> this product is very good selo relidad recommend all very good you can buy with your eyes closed and comes before than expected</li>
    <li> One tat machine was wrong and it broke the same day I got it so it sucked</li>
    <li> Was really happy with everything in this kit, other then the power supply dying after a short time.</li>
    <li> So i got this kit. everyone seems to trip about the power supply. there is a switch on the back, use it and the power supply will work normally. if youre getting this for the pot leaf machine you are mistakened it is the worst machine but is both a liner and a shader, the other 2 machines are good though. the lucky 7 machine is a shader, the gold one is the best machine which is a liner. also the ink sucks but overall its not a bad kit</li>
    <li> finally i got my things, just what i need it ..</li>
    <li> Everything is great; handles nicely, works great, and everything shown was in the box..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY problem,.. the flashbook disc is a VIRUS &amp; completely wiped my laptop&#x27;s hard drive clear!&lt;br /&gt;*would be 5 stars if not for that</li>
    <li> It took them a lot longer than what they said n forgot my inks. But they made it rt. They sent my inks to me and now I&#x27;m very satisfied with them</li>
    <li> Great kit...I rated it a 4 because it stated it was a beginner kit but didnt have any instructions.</li>
    <li> Hey I was looking to buy This kit, but I&#x27;ve read the only one review on here &amp; wanted to ask if the power supply is any good because that was the only problem that person had.is there anyway to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen to me before I buy this product?</li>
    <li> Yo sent me 2 of the same gun. And left out the red Palm leaf gun. That&#x27;s the gun that I wanted</li>
    <li> Bought this and power supply does not work, because of this i lost 6 clients, wasted tubes,needles.ink,gloves. i waited a almost a week deciding on which to order to get. i wanted this, i would like to just return the power supply but also have a 7rl needle&amp;tube and a 9mag needle and disposable gripped tube back too and ink for i didn&#x27;t crack anything open until i was supposed to use it.. i picked you guys i like what you have to offer i liked what i saw people say about your products, please get back at me for i am not a happy customer right now and dealing with unhappy customers of mine as well. thx</li>
    <li> terrible product no instructions and its the cheapest gun ive ever seen. I would highly recommend you buy one from somewhere else</li>
    <li> This kit is bull the left out two lights then switch two of the machines and did not tell me I am so mad I lost over 3,000 dollars waiting for this lame kit</li>
    <li> This brand isn&#x27;t allowed to be sold in Europe because the ink has chemicals that cause cancer! Shouldn&#x27;t be legal ANYWHERE. The machines are terrible! Put together very poorly. I honestly regret this purchase. The seller doesn&#x27;t contact back. So I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Kit was shipped fast and was a great price.  Everything worked excellent except the ink is junk.  (use it for practice only)  Guns work flawlessly and never heat up for me.  I your looking for a good kit, go with this one, you be happy you did, just order different ink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this 4 stars due to the ink.</li>
    <li> was not happy was missing the ink and the guns were poorly made. i planned on doing a tattoo the day i got the kit and couldn&#x27;t because i had to return it.</li>
    <li> I regretted getting this product as soon as I got it. Horribly constructed, shoddy paint job, and terrible inks. I didn&#x27;t realize I was buying  Chinese made products, if I had I would not have purchased this set</li>
    <li> Every thing seems to be good so far DVD won&#x27;t play tho but other then that its ok</li>
    <li> the product was great only thing is ink bottles are small an u gotta buy ur own case an black ink</li>
    <li> Just got this kit in June. After I got it I found out that the ink that comes with it called dragonhawk is a ink know to poison pwople and cause infections that take up to 4 antibiotics tip get rid of. The power supply works great. The stainless steel tips however I don&#x27;t like do to the open face on them the gap is too wide causing the ink to adopt everywhere. I won&#x27;t buy from dragon hawk again.</li>
    <li> This kit was garbage !!! I can say 3 out of 2 guns were gd. The ink suck so I had to keep redoing tattoos. I would not recommend this entire kit just the 2 guns.</li>
    <li> The ink is no good did my feet and now the ink is fading out already I did them a week ago and also got a infection from the ink machines work good only complaint is the fact that the ink sucks colors don&#x27;t go in good and they all fade</li>
    <li> Only had an issue with one gun and not knowing how to use the LED lights. I think it needs instructions on how to use them and which gun is used for lining and which is for shading. Ink was great too!</li>
