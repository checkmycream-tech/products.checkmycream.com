### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Seller is wonderful!!</li>
      <li>So, I went to the best source in town...</li>
      <li>and I was very happy with the quality and price!</li>
      <li>Great product for the price!  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve found that bleach is excellent at getting rid of any crud that may grow on them (make sure to rinse the bleach out thoroughly, or leave in the sun).     </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll get some good use out of them.</li>
      <li>These are wonderful to get your face scrub clean morning/evening.  </li>
      <li>I love these scrubbing loofah pads!</li>
      <li>so I am glad I could find them here on Amazon!</li>
      <li>So you must use your own hands to do the lathering.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful item for gently washing and exfoliating your face.</li>
      <li>The elastic band is a nice feature to have to hold onto when using the product or to hang it off of something else.</li>
      <li>There is a nice strap for the hand on one side.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started using the pad on my body instead, which seems a much more suitable use.</li>
      <li>These are great and should last me a good while.</li>
      <li>Way better than a wash cloth or just your fingers....</li>
      <li>I keep hoping it  will soften up and be more flexible.</li>
      <li>I use these often for my face and love them.  </li>
      <li>feels smoother and looks better.</li>
      <li>I was pleased that Amazon did accept the return of the unopened packages.</li>
      <li>Be sure to rinse them out well after use</li>
      <li>Bought these because I wanted more than one in a pack.  </li>
      <li>IT EXFOLIATES THE SKIN AND LEAVES YOUR FACE NICE AND CLEAN.  </li>
      <li>I like them just fine, except the fact that they are listed as face loofahs...</li>
      <li>I added these to my order to qualify for the free shipping.  </li>
      <li>I use it primarily with a papaya bar soap for whitening the skin and the [[ASIN:B000052YM4</li>
      <li>I do recommend wetting them well first before use so that they&#x27;re more pliable.</li>
      <li>These sponges work better with bar soaps since they can&#x27;t really develop a rich lather by themselves.</li>
      <li>Overall really good and reusable products to exfoliate your face.</li>
      <li>great product, comes very hard but softens and puffs up after using warm water on them.</li>
      <li>your skin feel clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>Nice loofahs that fit my hand with the strap on the back.  </li>
      <li>and I love how it leaves your skin baby soft!  </li>
      <li>it really worked nice and my skin is very soft now.  </li>
      <li>These little things are great.</li>
      <li>They might be good to use on your feet/heels or somewhere you have rough skin.</li>
      <li>The scrub is a bit rough, but good for getting the grime off your face.</li>
      <li>I will definitely pick up more once I go through them, they should last about a year or more, but I like to give extras away &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Those features would be useful when using for body scrub.</li>
      <li>They are priced right for a 3 pack.</li>
      <li>The elastic on the back makes it very easy to slip on my fingers and stays put.</li>
      <li>totally worth the price and after 2 months i&#x27;m still using the first pad.</li>
      <li>They were very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>As the picture shows, there is a fabric border outlining the front face, and it would&#x27;ve been nice if the spongy loofah material was thicker in the center so that it actually stuck out more than the border.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS FACIAL LOOFAH PAD</li>
      <li>First Time Use:  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect it to soften up over time to be useful for my wants.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to clean my face and it hurts to use it not only that you cant keep it clean...</li>
      <li>I used to be able to buy these in the local drugstore or grocery store, but have not been able to find them anywhere in a long time.</li>
      <li>I bought these pads purely for the purpose of exfoliating my face.</li>
      <li>I bought this pack to replace my older one that had pretty much bitten the dust.</li>
      <li>just fair its to hard to really rub over your face</li>
      <li>I put the face scrub on my face and then pass the loofah over it and rub gently</li>
      <li>A real MUST at my house.</li>
      <li>scrubs your face gently, yet</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing again for the purpose of exfoliating my face; I&#x27;ll try using a manual face brush instead, which would probably be much easier to use.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than buying them in the store</li>
      <li>The quality was okay but not quite what I expected.</li>
      <li>My face is so much cleaner after using this.</li>
      <li>My shower has a rather large, high up window that allows all kinds of stuff to come inside.</li>
      <li>Overall these are great for getting rid of dead skin and making it soft again.</li>
      <li>A facial brush (Clarisonic Mia, Olay, etc) is much more gentle, even though it can be a big investment.</li>
      <li>I find the size more convenient to use than a typical body loofah.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and very oily.</li>
      <li>They are cheap and roll up like a taco as so as they are wet.  </li>
      <li>I was pretty impressed with these as facial Loofah&#x27;s with only a minor complaint.</li>
      <li>Will definitely consider ordering more in the near future!</li>
      <li>Other folks will find it fine for that.  </li>
      <li>They really get deep down into your pores to make your face squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>Like one person who gave this product a favorable review, I have been using this size of loofah pad for years, and first found them at a \\&quot;Brick &amp; Mortar\\&quot; store (Big Lots).  </li>
      <li>They work wonders to exfolliate your skin and are gentle if you will allow them to get completely wet the first time you use it.  </li>
      <li>The 3 pak is less expensive than in the stores and the loofahs are perfect for cleaning my face each morning.</li>
      <li>and I really like that they leave my face soft, no red marks at all.  </li>
      <li>rough enough to leave your skin feeling sooooft and smooth...</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had these since last year and they&#x27;ve held up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think I brought these to round up the $25 for free shipping.</li>
      <li>The first time I used these they developed grey spots/smudges on the sponge surface.</li>
      <li>Like another person who gave this product a less favorable review, I purchased enough packs of three (3) pads to qualify for free shipping.</li>
      <li>By the time the loofah is soft enough to use on my face, they have already cleaned my body for a week or two...and naturally I don&#x27;t go to washing my face with them!</li>
      <li>My older one was not as thick and softened up relatively quick.</li>
      <li>The price was cheap and size is small and idea for facial washing.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been using these with a facial scrub and it has helped my face clear up.</li>
      <li>The size is small enough to work around my face to lightly buff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really flat and not fluffy at all.</li>
      <li>, so it&#x27;s even more awkward for the face since it&#x27;s only touching a small area at a time.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very rough, so you only need to go over your skin gently to exfoliate.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have said they don&#x27;t bend easily around corners and small areas.</li>
      <li>These little loofahs effectively remove dirt and makeup, without irritating my skin.</li>

<li> Just beware they are pretty stiff and rough.</li>
<li> They truly last a long time</li>
<li> They last a long time.</li>
<li> No matter how well I dry these out and hang them to allow air to the entire pad, they still start to grow mold within a couple of weeks.</li>
<li> but that&#x27;s a minor annoyance.</li>
<li> They take forever to dry out and are smaller than I expected.</li>
<li> UPC on this is 8-94195-00218-1, for those of you who may find this locally and look for other pricing options.</li>

    <li> No matter how well I dry these out and hang them to allow air to the entire pad, they still start to grow mold within a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. The size is small enough to work around my face to lightly buff. The elastic on the back makes it very easy to slip on my fingers and stays put.</li>
    <li> These little things are great. They are priced right for a 3 pack. I use them on my body. I put my hand through the strap and palm the loofah and scrub a dub dub!  I like them just fine, except the fact that they are listed as face loofahs...I don&#x27;t use them on my face, because they are pretty stiff! By the time the loofah is soft enough to use on my face, they have already cleaned my body for a week or two...and naturally I don&#x27;t go to washing my face with them!</li>
    <li> I use these often for my face and love them.  They are extremely hard to find in the small sizes and I was very happy with the quality and price!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!  Much cheaper than buying them in the store (though I won&#x27;t call the name of the store)!  They work wonders to exfolliate your skin and are gentle if you will allow them to get completely wet the first time you use it.  When I need to replace it, I will be coming back to Amazon!!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful to get your face scrub clean morning/evening.  It&lt;br /&gt;makes your skin feel clean and fresh.  I was not able to locate any in&lt;br /&gt;my small town.  So, I went to the best source in town...Amazon.  It arrived&lt;br /&gt;less than a week from the time I ordered it.  So, the product is fabulous;&lt;br /&gt;the Seller is wonderful!!</li>
    <li> First Time Use:  The first time I used these they developed grey spots/smudges on the sponge surface. I had to pick these off and so now have a gaping hole in the sponge. They are still usable however. I&#x27;m not sure if this stuff develops due to the bacteria in my skin or the environment but once I picked it off it did not return, so I assume it&#x27;s an inherent problem of the sponges, hence my 4 stars.     Usage:  The pads have the elastic bands to slip your hand through. I like to hang them from this in the shower to dry them properly (sponge facing down), but they still manage to get stuff growing on them after a month or so. These sponges work better with bar soaps since they can&#x27;t really develop a rich lather by themselves. So you must use your own hands to do the lathering. I use it primarily with a papaya bar soap for whitening the skin and the [[ASIN:B000052YM4 Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash - 6 fl oz]] to remove make-up/refresh.    Maintenance:  After a month or so of being in my shower the pads tend to develop nasty black stuff, mostly on the cloth (back and elastic) portions of the pads. My shower has a rather large, high up window that allows all kinds of stuff to come inside. So it is difficult to maintain a completely mildew free shower. But I&#x27;ve found that bleach is excellent at getting rid of any crud that may grow on them (make sure to rinse the bleach out thoroughly, or leave in the sun).     Overall really good and reusable products to exfoliate your face. I will definitely pick up more once I go through them, they should last about a year or more, but I like to give extras away &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Very rough on your skin but if you are looking for something that does its job cleaning this is it!</li>
    <li> Like one person who gave this product a favorable review, I have been using this size of loofah pad for years, and first found them at a \\&quot;Brick &amp; Mortar\\&quot; store (Big Lots).  They were very reasonably priced. I have never used them as a facial loofah, but used them as a body wash loofah. I find the size more convenient to use than a typical body loofah. I was very disappointed with the quality of these pads. Like another person who gave this product a less favorable review, I purchased enough packs of three (3) pads to qualify for free shipping. In the package I opened, two (2) out of the three (3) pads in the package were of such inferior quality, they were not usable for one&#x27;s body, let alone one&#x27;s face. The strands of loofah had sharp barb&#x27;s that were much too rough for skin, especially for facial skin. I was pleased that Amazon did accept the return of the unopened packages.</li>
    <li> Way better than a wash cloth or just your fingers.... scrubs your face gently, yet rough enough to leave your skin feeling sooooft and smooth... they need to be replaced every few months tho, depending on use level.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and very oily. These little loofahs effectively remove dirt and makeup, without irritating my skin. Yea!</li>
    <li> I just got them in the mail and I love how it leaves your skin baby soft!  I put the face scrub on my face and then pass the loofah over it and rub gently and that&#x27;s all it takes.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this pads in the shower and I really like that they leave my face soft, no red marks at all.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet. They&#x27;ve been sitting in my drawer. I think I brought these to round up the $25 for free shipping. But what I can say personally is that they feel so abrasive to touch that I haven&#x27;t brought myself to lather them up. The price was cheap and size is small and idea for facial washing. There is a nice strap for the hand on one side. It&#x27;s really flat and not fluffy at all.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like these at all! I have acne and sensitive skin, and this is NOT a good product for exfoliating my face. It was very painful and scratchy and left my face red and irritated. They might be good to use on your feet/heels or somewhere you have rough skin. I would not recommend them for the face though. A facial brush (Clarisonic Mia, Olay, etc) is much more gentle, even though it can be a big investment. I ended up selling these loofahs at a yard sale for 50 cents.</li>
    <li> I love these scrubbing loofah pads! They really get deep down into your pores to make your face squeaky clean! My face never felt cleaner. They are very hard to find in local stores so I am glad I could find them here on Amazon! Will definitely consider ordering more in the near future!</li>
    <li> I used to be able to buy these in the local drugstore or grocery store, but have not been able to find them anywhere in a long time. This is a wonderful item for gently washing and exfoliating your face. They last a long time.</li>
    <li> I wish it had a little storage container to place it in after using it.</li>
    <li> gentle enough to not be painful but rough enough to scrub away the dead skin cells on your face and get the dirt out of your pores when used with your facial cleanser. I use these everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean my face and it hurts to use it not only that you cant keep it clean...</li>
    <li> great product, comes very hard but softens and puffs up after using warm water on them.</li>
    <li> The pads are really thin. As the picture shows, there is a fabric border outlining the front face, and it would&#x27;ve been nice if the spongy loofah material was thicker in the center so that it actually stuck out more than the border. The elastic band is a nice feature to have to hold onto when using the product or to hang it off of something else. One of the pads in my 3-pk came with a broken elastic band.</li>
    <li> I have used small loofah sponges before to exfoliate my face, and was hoping to use these for the same.  However, they are hard as rocks.  I mean literally, actually, it&#x27;s like washing your face with a rock.  No bend at all, and shaped like a ball when wet and puffed up, so it&#x27;s even more awkward for the face since it&#x27;s only touching a small area at a time.  I do like the little band you can use to hold it on your hand, and they usable for elbows and knees.  But not good for the face.</li>
    <li> These are not too hard to use on the face. My face is so much cleaner after using this. Gets off all makeup, dead skin and unclogs my pores. I can literally see how disgusting and clogged they are before use and then after that&#x27;s all gone.</li>
    <li> Nice loofahs that fit my hand with the strap on the back.  They truly last a long time and i had to use them for my feet.  I had surgery and the doctor told me to wash my feet when they were healed with a zinc shampoo and a loofah.  it really worked nice and my skin is very soft now.  I did not use them on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for years and will continue to do so.  Really removes the dead skin cells from my face.  A real MUST at my house.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using these with a facial scrub and it has helped my face clear up. feels smoother and looks better. totally worth the price and after 2 months i&#x27;m still using the first pad. they last.</li>
    <li> The 3 pak is less expensive than in the stores and the loofahs are perfect for cleaning my face each morning.</li>
    <li> I added these to my order to qualify for the free shipping.  I wouldn&#x27;t order them again.  They take forever to dry out and are smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> I was pretty impressed with these as facial Loofah&#x27;s with only a minor complaint. As other reviewers have said they don&#x27;t bend easily around corners and small areas. I do recommend wetting them well first before use so that they&#x27;re more pliable. I also noticed that the handle does not stay on my hand well but that&#x27;s a minor annoyance. Overall these are great for getting rid of dead skin and making it soft again. Be sure to rinse them out well after use and you&#x27;ll get some good use out of them.</li>
    <li> just fair its to hard to really rub over your face</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS FACIAL LOOFAH PAD IT EXFOLIATES THE SKIN AND LEAVES YOUR FACE NICE AND CLEAN.  WOULD DEFINETLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.</li>
    <li> As these are fabricated, when wet, the loofa expands so much that it domes up into half an orange and it is STIFF.  The white fabric side is then caused to be concave.  I was hoping to use both sides on face - instead of wash cloth.  This will not do that. Too stiff and rough for face.  I don&#x27;t expect it to soften up over time to be useful for my wants.  I did also cut off the elastic band on the back, which would hold it on your hand and cut off the tabbed loop used for hanging because of my intent. Those features would be useful when using for body scrub. Other folks will find it fine for that.  UPC on this is 8-94195-00218-1, for those of you who may find this locally and look for other pricing options.</li>
    <li> I bought this pack to replace my older one that had pretty much bitten the dust. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and it&#x27;s still so stiff that it makes it difficult to use. My older one was not as thick and softened up relatively quick. Not so with these. I am not enjoying them at all at the moment. I keep hoping it  will soften up and be more flexible. So far it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> I bought these pads purely for the purpose of exfoliating my face. Overall, these accomplish that purpose. They&#x27;re very rough, so you only need to go over your skin gently to exfoliate. I like that the pads have a strap on the back so that the pad stays on your hand when you&#x27;re using it. After I&#x27;m done using it, I&#x27;m left with a fresher complexion and softer skin. I&#x27;ve had these since last year and they&#x27;ve held up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is that the pads are large and very stiff, making them awkward to use on the face. When I&#x27;m trying to  exfoliate in small areas, such as in the corners around my nose, it&#x27;s very difficult because the pad doesn&#x27;t really bend to allow you to get into small areas on your face. Plus, because the pad is pretty sizable (almost as tall as the palm of my hand), moving this large pad that doesn&#x27;t bend around my face is just plain awkward. I&#x27;ve started using the pad on my body instead, which seems a much more suitable use. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again for the purpose of exfoliating my face; I&#x27;ll try using a manual face brush instead, which would probably be much easier to use.</li>
    <li> these seem to be particularly difficult to keep sanitary and reusing them becomes frustrating over a week or so. These are definitely short-term use products.</li>
    <li> The quality was okay but not quite what I expected.</li>
    <li> It was to stiff.  You could not bend it even after it was wet.  It would not contour to your face to wash it.  I would never suggest any of my friends to buy this.</li>
    <li> these items were a waste of money.  They are cheap and roll up like a taco as so as they are wet.  They do not work as a loofah either</li>
    <li> The scrub is a bit rough, but good for getting the grime off your face. For the price it is hard to argue with these. Just beware they are pretty stiff and rough.</li>
    <li> Bought these because I wanted more than one in a pack.  These are great and should last me a good while.</li>
