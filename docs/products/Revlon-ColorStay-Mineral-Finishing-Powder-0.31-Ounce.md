<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I use over my regular blush. Alone it doesn&#x27;t do much on my skin tone. I am African American. When I use a small amount of blush and then this product, I like the bronze or slight sparkle I get but I read a blog where the reviewer swore by this product and I was excited to try it but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Pleasant the result of this powder on the cheeks, nice sheen ideal for very fine pigment makeup glow effect day or night according to whether your application, use the brow bone and to brighten up some very matte shadows.&lt;br /&gt;I put 4 stars because NO lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have used this one forever but can no longer find it in the drugstores. I was thrilled to find it online!! ;-)</li>
    <li> High Hogg High High High. High hf h jk duh f g n y fh b t u. He. He</li>
    <li> Love it!  So upset that it&#x27;s been discontinued.  I use it every day.  Just a moisturizer and ColorStay.  I never use a spot treatment, foundation, or even blush.  It&#x27;s just perfect, and everyone always asks how I get such great color.  I keep it my little secret.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this for over a year!!!  I couldn&#x27;t read who it was made by on the back so I did a search on Amazon and low and behold.  I didn&#x27;t wait long for it&#x27;s arrival and there was no S/H!!!! I should have bought 2!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore, and it&#x27;s cost compared to other expensive (similar) products is unbeatable! Arrived on time!</li>
    <li> Cannot find this product in stores anymore.  It is longlasting, perfect for that finishing touch, adds a little color to brighten the face.  I bought two just in case Revlon decides not to make it anymore.  This should last quite a while.</li>
    <li> It didnt show on my skin. Im a honey skin tone and it didnt even show up.....I brought this as a mac soft and gentle dupe but totally not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Idk I thought it was a mineral powder...feels like a hard stiff unbreakable substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I gotta try the mac now</li>
    <li> Works great for any season</li>
    <li> Great color and just the right amount of shimmer! I have an olive/tan skin tone and the color looks great! A little bit goes a long way, too. The color looks better than another bronzer I have and I paid about 4 times more for it! This is a great product for the price!</li>
