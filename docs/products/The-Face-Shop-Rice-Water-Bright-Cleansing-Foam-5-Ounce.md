      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use mine up and purchase some more.</li>
      <li>I noticed I was more prone to breakouts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say this is #2-3 on my list of favorite cleansers.</li>

      <li>Love the scent, it&#x27;s creamy and sudsy together.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the richness to this face cleanser.</li>
      <li>A great light wash leaves skin feeling clean soft and smells great.</li>

      <li>It is light on the skin and foams up well.</li>
      <li>makes face feel smooth.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
      <li>This seems like a good product if you already have clear skin.</li>
      <li>My face is clean and smooth</li>
      <li>After using my cleasing oil, I use this and my face is squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>It made my face feels so clean afterward.</li>
      <li>Very light fragrance, pleasant lather, not too tight feel after rinsing.</li>
      <li>It leaves my face feeling super clean and refreshed, but also moisturized( but you do have to moisturize afterwards.)</li>
      <li>Makes my face super oily.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and it is very soft on my skin.</li>
      <li>Gentle cream foam, evens out nicely and smells simple and clean.  </li>
      <li>However, it makes your skin squeaky clean, which I love, but I know some people actually like the creaminess (or oiliness in my book) that some cleansers leave.</li>
      <li>My face feels very clean and refreshed afterwards but not dry.</li>
      <li>should have realized and done my research first.</li>
      <li>With so many things on the market, it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about this stuff that makes it special, but my face just feels so clean after I use it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a necessary addition though it provides a good massaging opportunity prior to cleansing.</li>
      <li>Wonderful gentle cleanser, seems to work very well and does not leave my face feeling tight or dry at all.</li>
      <li>I cover a birthmark and am very picky about makeup removers and face washes so for me to like it, it has to work well.</li>
      <li>really like it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t think it brighten my face much</li>
      <li>I would joke with her about how high maintenance she was that she would order her facewash all the way from Korea, but after she had me try this, let me just say nobody&#x27;s joking anymore!</li>
      <li>I highly reccommend this!</li>
      <li>but I have a whole process of moisturizers I use after my cleanser so for cleansing purposes</li>
      <li>Thank u so much .</li>
      <li>It definitely made my skin feel more soft and supple, but after I started using it</li>
      <li>Smells great, and although it does leave my skin a little dry, the brightening effect is unmistakable.</li>
      <li>Decent cleanser.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>The first few times I ordered this shipping took several weeks since I think it was coming from Korea, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue any more (esp.</li>
      <li>this leaves my skin so soft.</li>
      <li>My face felt soft and refreshed after my bath.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on a total Korean beauty kick lately, and this is my new favorite face wash.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s somehow able to draw out all the excess oil without over-drying (though I do usually apply a generic face moisturizer after cleansing).</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if I had acne it would do anything special.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Bright&amp;#34; is apparently PR code for white.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
      <li>Okay Korea has officially won the facewash game..</li>
      <li>I have been having troubles with red spots on my face but it calm it down...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this cleanser for all normal to oily skins and only for dry skin if you wear a lot of makeup.</li>
      <li>A little bit foams up really well.</li>

<li> The tube is definitely going to last a long time.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it with the cleansing oil, and I&#x27;m not entirely impressed with the oil in and of itself although it is very mild.</li>
<li> I have oily skin in the summer and really dry skin in the winter</li>
<li> Could be a little cheaper but should last a long time.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll recommend it for dry skin!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only user it for a few days with the rice water oil cleanser</li>
<li> I have yet to be disappointed by a cleanser from The Face Shop, but this one is probably my favorite.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little bit dry</li>
<li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars so as not to change the average.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a thick, lotion-y consistency and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> already pale</li>
<li> /&gt;Moving on.. I&#x27;ve used almost everything sold in drug stores to keep my acne in check, and while I&#x27;m not sure a &amp;#34;silver bullet&amp;#34; cleanser truly exists, this is probably the closest I&#x27;ve gotten to one.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can return it or not.</li>
<li> Its delicate.</li>
<li> On the plus side, it provides a subtle brightness to my skin.</li>
<li> it very hard to wash off.</li>
<li> so 1 use won&#x27;t mess me up, but I&#x27;d hate for someone with a darker skin tone to get an unintended surprise.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> THIS IS MY MOST FAVOURITE CLEANSER OF ALL!!!! It is light on the skin and foams up well. The scent is light and pleasant. It leaves my face feeling super clean and refreshed, but also moisturized( but you do have to moisturize afterwards.) I can&#x27;t wait to use mine up and purchase some more. I&#x27;m thinking of buying some more just for my friends and family. I highly reccommend this!</li>
    <li> amazing cleanser with light scent I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way so this should last a few months easily with daily use morning and night. Very light fragrance, pleasant lather, not too tight feel after rinsing. My face felt soft and refreshed after my bath. Will buy again. Could be a little cheaper but should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love the richness to this face cleanser. It makes my skin feel fantastic. Great price, too!</li>
    <li> Wonderful gentle cleanser, seems to work very well and does not leave my face feeling tight or dry at all. This stuff smells great, though if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Works great! I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> Makes my face super oily.</li>
    <li> A great light wash leaves skin feeling clean soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only user it for a few days with the rice water oil cleanser and I can&#x27;t def see a difference in the brightness in my skin. And others have noticed as well. Looking forward to see how much better it can get.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, a gamble of a try.  Gentle cream foam, evens out nicely and smells simple and clean.  Unfortunately, it drys out my skin.  On the plus side, it provides a subtle brightness to my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it, it stripes the oils off my face and it very hard to wash off. It doesn&#x27;t foam well and it just feels like slimy white gunk.</li>
    <li> Best cleanser I have ever use, it make my skin feel to fresh.</li>
    <li> i use it with my konjac sponge. Cleanses great and smells divine. Love Korean products!</li>
    <li> really like it. makes face feel smooth. haven&#x27;t seen a BIG lightening effect but I&#x27;ve been out in the sun a lot though. would get it again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it is very soft on my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this every night before I shower.  My face is clean and smooth I love it!</li>
    <li> product came in good order and it foams nicely on the hands and face and cleans your face smooth and soft</li>
    <li> I bought this for morning cleansing. I like it very much!!</li>
    <li> Love the scent, it&#x27;s creamy and sudsy together. It&#x27;s nice</li>
    <li> Thank u so much . Exelllent</li>
    <li> I am going to buy this again because it actually helps my skin and brighten the tone... I have been having troubles with red spots on my face but it calm it down... sometimes I wash my face with rice water. Plus i actually changed all my cleansing product to this brand... I love it.</li>
    <li> I use this at night and it feels so great! A little bit foams up really well. I love foam cleansers so this makes me really happy! The tube is definitely going to last a long time. My face feels very clean and refreshed afterwards but not dry. My mom even tried it and she said she really liked it.</li>
    <li> It definitely made my skin feel more soft and supple, but after I started using it I noticed I was more prone to breakouts. I used it continuously for about three weeks and it did not seem to help at all with blemishes or acne prone skin. This seems like a good product if you already have clear skin.</li>
    <li> Decent cleanser. Its delicate.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think it brighten my face much but I think it cleans well. It made my face feels so clean afterward. I have oily skin in the summer and really dry skin in the winter so I think for now, since it&#x27;s summer, it works great for me. It&#x27;s a little bit dry so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll recommend it for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Very good cleanser, it removes makeup well without makes skin oily</li>
    <li> Works great, it really did help brighten my acne scars. It&#x27;s a bit drying though,so I think this would be great for oily skin. Great cleanser and nice scent.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency of the foam, I love how it makes my face feel. I will buy it again when I run out. I was amazed that I actually did look brighter after I used it.</li>
    <li> this leaves my skin so soft. However, I have really great skin already so I&#x27;m not sure if I had acne it would do anything special.</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my face after I use the cleansing oil of this same brand to take my makeup and sebum off. It works great and smells great. It is very gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! After using my cleasing oil, I use this and my face is squeaky clean. I wear alot of makeup bc I cover a birthmark and am very picky about makeup removers and face washes so for me to like it, it has to work well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars so as not to change the average. I&#x27;ve only used it once (my face feels nice).&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to warn you that I went to the Face Shop&#x27;s webpage and it&#x27;s suggested use is for Whitening/Lightening. &amp;#34;Bright&amp;#34; is apparently PR code for white.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already pale so 1 use won&#x27;t mess me up, but I&#x27;d hate for someone with a darker skin tone to get an unintended surprise.&lt;br /&gt;I should have realized and done my research first. I&#x27;m not sure if I can return it or not.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get a cleanser better than this at this price point. I&#x27;d say this is #2-3 on my list of favorite cleansers. The scent is mild, the foaming is superior and cost is quite extraordinary. It effectively removes your makeup, and keeps your skin bright and clear. However, it makes your skin squeaky clean, which I love, but I know some people actually like the creaminess (or oiliness in my book) that some cleansers leave. I&#x27;d recommend this cleanser for all normal to oily skins and only for dry skin if you wear a lot of makeup. My skin tends to be combination but I have a whole process of moisturizers I use after my cleanser so for cleansing purposes, I want it all off!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it with the cleansing oil, and I&#x27;m not entirely impressed with the oil in and of itself although it is very mild. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a necessary addition though it provides a good massaging opportunity prior to cleansing.</li>
    <li> Okay Korea has officially won the facewash game.. I was introduced to this cleanser and others from The Face Shop by my Korean friend who has the most flawless skin. I would joke with her about how high maintenance she was that she would order her facewash all the way from Korea, but after she had me try this, let me just say nobody&#x27;s joking anymore! **The first few times I ordered this shipping took several weeks since I think it was coming from Korea, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue any more (esp. because it&#x27;s now on Prime)**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on.. I&#x27;ve used almost everything sold in drug stores to keep my acne in check, and while I&#x27;m not sure a &amp;#34;silver bullet&amp;#34; cleanser truly exists, this is probably the closest I&#x27;ve gotten to one.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a total Korean beauty kick lately, and this is my new favorite face wash. It&#x27;s a thick, lotion-y consistency and a little goes a long way. Smells great, and although it does leave my skin a little dry, the brightening effect is unmistakable.</li>
