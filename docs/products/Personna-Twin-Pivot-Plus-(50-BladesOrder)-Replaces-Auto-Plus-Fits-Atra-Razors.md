      <li>The cheap Atra and TrackII copies at Dollar Stores perform much better than these blades.  </li>

      <li>thanks for filling the order on time and the product works good.  </li>
      <li>Glad I could still find these!  too much of a throw away society!  </li>
      <li>I razor burn easily</li>
      <li>This bulk package provides a good value and a decent product.</li>
      <li>I have been using a double edge blades for a good many years and love them, saw these at Amazon and decided to try them.</li>
      <li>These twin blades are fine.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would use them if I were a man, shaving my face, but for a woman, these are fine.  </li>
      <li>Cheap and work fine.</li>

      <li>The blades fit two of my existing handles</li>
      <li>(smooth skin).</li>
      <li>These blades are cheap but they remind me of the ones I got at the 99 cent store.</li>
      <li>But they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
      <li>because it&#x27;s so cheap.  </li>
      <li>Blades fit both my atra and twin 11razors.</li>
      <li>I should not have trusted something so cheap.</li>
      <li>They appear to fit my razor.  </li>
      <li>I shopped around for some atra blades for a reasonable price, bought these and am loving them.</li>
      <li>but  it does fit, and holds its edge.</li>
      <li>Very good blade, not too sharp</li>
      <li>Good quality for the price, not as nice as some of the other no name brands.</li>
      <li>You get 50 blades for a good price and you get at least a week of good shaves out of one cartridge before you change to a fresh one.</li>
      <li>They provide an equal or better shave than the HB3 and much better than the HB4 or HB6.  </li>
      <li>These blades work great for my Atra razor and last really well.</li>
      <li>I will re-order more on my next amazon purchase to keep many on hand.....</li>
      <li>I did not like the &#x27;lubricating strip&#x27; which gets sticky if used with very HOT water.</li>
      <li>every bit as good as the blades I use to get at Walmart only much cheaper!</li>
      <li>15 real ones, but they nic you up too easily.  </li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>So for the price really worth it.</li>
      <li>Certainly worth the money.</li>
      <li>These blades are just as good as any other brand of blades for my razor.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper and easier on the environment than the full plastic blades.</li>
      <li>I gave only 4 stars because it still doesn&#x27;t perform like a true ATRA !!</li>
      <li>The price is great and the blades I been getting from gillette were almost dull right out of the package.  </li>
      <li>have enough blades for a long, long time, and they are quite good enough for my purposes, and I save SO MUCH money, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The blades are good. I did not like the &#x27;lubricating strip&#x27; which gets sticky if used with very HOT water. But I reduced temperature and the problem was solved.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium texture hair and get four or five shaves from a blade set. My rule for shaving is  &#x27; You can HEAR the shave and it is ok but if you feel the shave it is time for a new blade&#x27;. Which means that it is different strokes for different beards.</li>
    <li> Yes, these are razor blades, and yes, you can shave with them, but there will be blood. If you try to use one more than a couple times you may need a transfusion. After using these blades for a couple months (I got a 50 pack) I tried to donate at the blood drive at work, but the phlebotomist told me that my red cell count was too low to be of any use. If you&#x27;re a hemophiliac these will kill you, pure and simple. It&#x27;s like trying to shave with a grapefruit spoon. But they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
    <li> Certainly worth the money. Doesn&#x27;t give as comfortable a shave as Gelettes.</li>
    <li> great deal on a now hard to find item, thanks</li>
    <li> Outstanding in all respects, in product performance, price and delivery! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband, and his razor he can never find replacements for. He says they are just like the one&#x27;s he used to use. We were a little skeptical about the price versus quality. However he says he can get three to four shaves out of each one, and that includes shaving his head. So can&#x27;t beat it. Thanks!! We will be reordering again!!</li>
    <li> Very good blade, not too sharp</li>
    <li> The price is great and the blades I been getting from gillette were almost dull right out of the package.  I was getting 2 or 3 shaves from them so I tried these at 1/3rd the price.</li>
    <li> the blades are not sharp , pull on skin, dont know if they really are pesonna blades,would not buy again</li>
    <li> thanks for filling the order on time and the product works good.  good fit for my razor thanks again and i will order when i&#x27;m running low</li>
    <li> Blades fit both my atra and twin 11razors. Plus a fantastic price and great shipping. Will do it again when my supply starts to run out</li>
    <li> My dad wanted them. He said they work great thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my face shredded by generic blades for my Gillette Atra. Not these. They are a little less streamlined than the Gillettes, but work great.</li>
    <li> In combination with the all-metal Atra/Trac II compatible handle I bought at the same time, these blades mean I won&#x27;t be paying the highly inflated prices shaving companies charge for their new designs (which they put on the market only because the patents on their old designs have expired).  Each of these blades lasts me a couple of weeks, I can&#x27;t tell much (if any) difference between them and the name-brand blades.  The price is so low compared to today&#x27;s five-blade, pivoting, roller etc. designs that even if these blades only lasted half as long they&#x27;d still be an amazing deal.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order more of these blades.</li>
    <li> Our local stores quit carrying generic Atra razors, so I reluctantly bought a 5-pack of the fancy &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brand for as much as I paid for 50 of these, thinking that I&#x27;d get several shaves out of each one.  The expensive ones gave me 1-2 shaves before becoming unacceptably dull, so I headed for Amazon and found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are at least as good as the expensive ones I bought, but in fact they seem to hold their edge longer, and work great.  new life for my old Atra.</li>
    <li> These seem to be nearly as high as quality as the Gillette Atra blades. I have tried some other store brand blades that were poor quality.  These seem to last long and stay sharp.  Great value.</li>
    <li> I use these on my HeadBlade ATX with the yellow adapter (it came with the HB3).  It took a little getting used to, about a week, but I love the blades since then.  They provide an equal or better shave than the HB3 and much better than the HB4 or HB6.  I shave my head daily, and being bald by choice, I have a lot of growth.  I&#x27;ve gotten as many as 5-7 shaves out of one cartridge, but tend to change the blade twice a week (Friday and Monday) because it&#x27;s so cheap.  Most cost effective shave I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy for razor blades.  My husband would pay alot more for the same quality blades in the retail stores,</li>
    <li> I shopped around for some atra blades for a reasonable price, bought these and am loving them. I use them for around a week at a time shaving my scalp everyday. I have used about 10 of them so far and my only complaint would be that they are difficult to flush out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Just like the originals.  Will return for more later..........</li>
    <li> Good and met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Best value for money.  Remember it works for tracII and Atra.  If you wait a week between shaving it will clog up a bit but it works well for daily or twice a week shaving.</li>
    <li> cuts my face more than any blade I have ever used...even with very light pressure.....I&#x27;ve only used 5 but I&#x27;m thinking about throwing the rest of them away</li>
    <li> The blades fit and have the same basic shape but are just a little thicker which may cause them not to pivot quite as much.  They seem to be of good quality just started using one.  Glad I found them.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try these on the handle I have from Dollar Shave Club, and they do fit, but not perfectly.  They go on very tight and come springing off quite far when removed, and when they are on the handle they sit at kind of an odd angle - I have to hold the handle nearly parallel to the floor to shave correctly.  Quality of the blades is decent.</li>
    <li> Thought I would get an older razor system to saber money because the new stuff is ridiculous. These things work but only for a couple shaves. You better change it too or you&#x27;ll be bloody and battered! They probably will still save me a little money though. I suppose they&#x27;ll last awhile.</li>
    <li> My husband had looked several places for these blades without success.&lt;br /&gt;Received them within a short time and they were just what he had been looking for.</li>
    <li> I like Personna DE Blades but these hurt to shave with. Cant hold a candle to Gillette. I guess you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> Great blades..every bit as good as the blades I use to get at Walmart only much cheaper!</li>
    <li> these are great I will buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having a better shave now than I&#x27;ve ever had, with this razor and blades.&lt;br /&gt;  Glen Staflund</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price, not as nice as some of the other no name brands. I typically get two weeks out of a razor, these I get one...but still worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Works great for me!  I don&#x27;t know if I would use them if I were a man, shaving my face, but for a woman, these are fine.  I usually buy the grocery store brand replacement blades, and these are very comparable to that--so not top of the line, but I don&#x27;t need that.  Possibly they get dull a bit quicker than the grocery store brand--I&#x27;m not quite sure if that is true as I have only used one so far, but even it was, these are so cheap I can just throw them away sooner and use a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enough blades for a long, long time, and they are quite good enough for my purposes, and I save SO MUCH money, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> very happy to find and at a great price these blades. I had bought another set about a year ago but couldn&#x27;t find the rest after a move so I just ordered more. Someday I&#x27;ll find the rest had have enough probably for life</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find them anywhere else and my husband and myself have old razors these are perfect</li>
    <li> Perhaps three or four blades give a closer shave, but I&#x27;ve found two sufficient.  This bulk package provides a good value and a decent product.</li>
    <li> I used one blade one time. Ended up with many small micro cuts. My face was sore when I got done and little while later I noticed several tin little blood spots. Gonna try and get my money back!</li>
    <li> Even better than expected for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very glad to have found these. They are the best!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I put one of these blades in my Headblade this morning to give it a try.  I cut up the back of my head so badly that I had to throw them out mid-shave.  There must be an asymmetry issue or something that causes these blades to be rather dangerous.  I should not have trusted something so cheap.</li>
    <li> They appear to fit my razor.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they look to be okay.</li>
    <li> great price.  good product</li>
    <li> Awesome can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  The blades fit two of my existing handles and I got a great shave.</li>
    <li> If you expect the best shave of your life, these blades are not for you. They are, however a good value and do a reasonably good job. I have a very tough beard and find that I spend much more time trying to get a close shave with these than a normal trac II blade.</li>
    <li> Awesome deal would give these 20 stars if they had that high of a rating I bought at least 2 years of blades for the price I would&#x27;ve paid for a few months in the expensive name brand blades. These blades work great for my Atra razor and last really well.</li>
    <li> Only one shave per blade vs 3 or 4 with original Atra plus blades.  They do nic you up.  50 blades &#x3D; 15 real ones, but they nic you up too easily.  I will not try again.</li>
    <li> Great product, unreal price. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> These fit nicely on my atra shaver and give a nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> If you have bout razor blades recently then you already know they are way over priced ! These blades seem to work well by a brand name &amp; realistically priced.</li>
    <li> Good shave, excellent value for $, only concern is country of origin or MFG. name not listed.</li>
    <li> These blades are poorly designed.  The angle of the blade is different from that in the Atra and TrackII.  One will see better results if the beard is softer texture, but for medium to course beards they perform poorly.  I have tried to use them, 3 blades so far, but I consistently have small cuts all over my face.  The cheap Atra and TrackII copies at Dollar Stores perform much better than these blades.  I do not recommend</li>
    <li> These blades are cheap but they remind me of the ones I got at the 99 cent store. That is, they are inconsistent.&lt;br /&gt;One will be quite good, the next one will be uneven and drag across my face, even cut me.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy these again unless I can&#x27;t find a better quality deal somewhere.</li>
    <li> Glad I could still find these!  too much of a throw away society!  These refills save you money!</li>
    <li> I bought the personna-twin pivot plus blades and I liked them. You get 50 blades for a good price and you get at least a week of good shaves out of one cartridge before you change to a fresh one. I was satisfied with this product plus buying in bulk should last you a long time.</li>
    <li> these razors fit my Atra / Vector, but they look a bit differently than the normal atra cartridges do.. but they work splendidly :)</li>
    <li> I used to find these at walmart &amp; then they quit selling them for another brand (crappy).  So Glad I found these again.  I will re-order more on my next amazon purchase to keep many on hand.....</li>
    <li> Cheap and work fine. So long Dollar Shave Club. Thanks for the funny video!</li>
    <li> Great shaves. Unbelievable price. Used to pay lots more at Walmart for the same cartridge. Glad that Walmart stopped carrying them. It forced me to look online and get a much better deal.</li>
    <li> Anything else is marketing hype...if you want to shell out a fortune for the latest and greatest gimmickry, be my guest.  But I have been using these for many years and they are great!!</li>
    <li> very pleased with this purchase. would recommend to anyone looking for a bargin.</li>
    <li> A great deal on razor blades. I can&#x27;t tell the difference in theses and the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as advertised. The construction seems to be slightly less solid than the original blades, but not enough to be a problem. Great value for the money!</li>
    <li> It is not  quite the same as the original razors but  it does fit, and holds its edge. Been using the same one for over a week now.</li>
    <li> The blades are great.  It is very close together and it doesn&#x27;t irritate as others.  The only thing is you need to till the head in the right angle to shave.  They are still sharp after a week.</li>
    <li> So far, so good with these blades; seem to be as good as the best of other after-market blades for Atra razors that I&#x27;ve tried, and the price is great.</li>
    <li> After using these blades for a few weeks, decided to order more because they work well and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Penni&#x27;s husband says: I&#x27;m not a connoisseur of razor blades... been shaving with the handle and same type of head for about 35 years. I just don&#x27;t buy all the hype over the new 5 blade heads. When the stores stopped selling twin blades I was in a panic. Their marketing was now forcing me to buy overpriced, unnecessary products! These twin blades are fine. I have a medium to heavy beard and non-sensitive skin. These blades have no trouble cutting and I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet (smooth skin). I learned a trick on the Clark Howard show about drying your blades thoroughly after each use (don&#x27;t leave them wet in the drawer). Now a single blade lasts me at least 2 weeks. That means I have 2 years worth of blades for less than $10... heck yeah! Highly recommend. Those $50 12-pack of blades... a fool and his money.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well the blade performed. I have tried several Atra substitutes over the years. Most were no better than a disposable. You know, one scratchy shave and throw it away.. But I can use this blade for several shaves without scratching my face..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very pleased.. Great price !!! I gave only 4 stars because it still doesn&#x27;t perform like a true ATRA !!</li>
    <li> Great deal and they work nearly as well as the Atras.</li>
    <li> Kinda bought these by mistake but I&#x27;m glad I did, I found an old Atra handle and have been using them ever since. Well worth the money compared to the cost of other blades. I hope to buy more when this batch runs out.</li>
    <li> I have been using a double edge blades for a good many years and love them, saw these at Amazon and decided to try them. I used them in a old Gillette Atra razor and they worked great. They may not shave quiet as close as a good double edge but they are very close and I don&#x27;t have to be as careful against nicks and cuts.</li>
    <li> These blades are just as good as any other brand of blades for my razor. And the cheap price makes these the winner!</li>
    <li> Worked as well as other brands... but cost much less...&lt;br /&gt;Quite satisfied with product...</li>
    <li> They are not as good as Gillette&#x27;s; however, hard to match the price.  If you shave daily, they are just fine.  A few days stubble and you will notice the pull.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as advertised. Five ten packs equal a lot of shaving.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality! Works great!!</li>
    <li> I razor burn easily so I will use for two shaves max then toss. The blade&#x27;s edges deform and scratch if I push it. So for the price really worth it. Much cheaper and easier on the environment than the full plastic blades. The blade quality I find equal to the plastic razors.</li>
