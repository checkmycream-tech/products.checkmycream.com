      <li>It has a very nondescript smell, just a sortof...oil smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use it for my hair and there&#x27;s a noticeable difference in texture----for the better! Don&#x27;t use it on skin though, it made me breakout.</li>
    <li> Great oil. I wish it came in a glass bottle but it is a great product!</li>
    <li> I LOOOVE this oil on my hair!!!! its makes it so soft,&lt;br /&gt;and manageable and there&#x27;s no smell.</li>
    <li> Great for skin and hair. After a summer in sun both my skin and hair were dried from sun exposure. This oil was just what the Dr. ordered to replenish both.</li>
    <li> love love love this one I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> A good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Works great in my hair, and is light weight. I am African American with 3b,3c, and 4a hair so this oil works great in my hair. The oil works for all hair types so give it a try: you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Nice oil, nice packaging.  Only one issue; I wish it had a dropper, but if it did, the price would probably be more.</li>
    <li> I add this to my lotions and it moisturizes my skin very well! I used it on my face even and it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
    <li> I like to mix a few drops of this oil with rosewater as my nightly moisturizer</li>
    <li> Got my order quicker than I thought it would come. Came intact. No problems</li>
    <li> Use regularly on my natural hair</li>
    <li> I needed a carrier oil for the Thieves oil from Bulk Apothecary, very happy with this oil and use it for general moistuerizer.</li>
    <li> Love this oil and this seller is great. Combined shipping since I ordered 3, 4 ounce bottles of oils. Recieved fairly quick too. I saw someone said it took almost 2 weeks to arrive, mine didnt and even if it did, so be it. The oils are worth the wait and they do not advertise 2 day shipping like amazon prime does. WILL buy from again and will be recommending to friends and family</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very happy with this oil. price is good and 4 ounces will last a while. it softens and clears my face, giving it a nice healthy glow. I&#x27;ve read reviews before that said &#x27;...glowing skin&#x27;, now i know what they ment.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to add to my hair that would give it shine, make it manageable, and overall, not affect my face. I was using another hair product that contained a lot of additional chemicals and my forehead was in constant breakout. My mother recommended Jojoba Oil and I gave it a shot. After reading reviews and product description, I gave it a whirl. From hair to all over my body, this stuff is amazing. I never felt so nourished before, like my skin was actually drinking this stuff. The first day I tried it I took an 8 hour train ride and the entire time, I just felt GOOD. My skin didn&#x27;t have any reaction, in fact, I kinda had, and still have a glow immediately after application. I added a few drops of lavender oil for scent, and its even better. I apply after my shower, and even a little to my face before I shave as a pre conditioner. Give it a shot. It&#x27;s natural, and you wont be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend ordering Jojoba Golden by H&amp;B Oils Center!!! Give your skin what it needs.</li>
    <li> I used this and reordered in a larger size. odorless, moisturizing, it was perfect to use in my home made shaving cream and body lotions.</li>
    <li> Love this for hydrating the under eye area without greasiness!  Absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face twice daily.  It absorbs and does not leave me feeling tight and dry like drugstore products.</li>
    <li> This oil is liquid gold.  It absorbs nicely into the skin.  I dry brush and follow with this oil morning and night and my skin has never looked better and felt so smooth.  I use it on my face as well.  I usually break out with night creams but not with this stuff... It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love this, I sometimes use this plain . it absorbs quickly, and is a nice product also a decent price</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how quickly I got this product in the mail. I ordered it to use for my stretched ears to keep them moisturized and it works so well! Also, this bottle literally comes as full as you can get it. I was glad it didn&#x27;t come 3/4 full like a lot of other things I order. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I use this in my hair about once a week....I put my hair in a pony tail and what hangs from the pony tail I slather the jojoba oil on it and wrap it in a bun or put a shower cap on and let it sit for at least 30 mins, get in the shower and let hot water beat on my head (with the shower cap on) for a few minutes, rinse my hair, then shampoo and condition as normal....my hair is so soft, shiny, and feels amazing.....I also mix it with coconut and grape seed oils once a month. I love this oil!</li>
    <li> I guess it works OK.  It&#x27;s oil.</li>
    <li> I tried this for my face but my skin didn&#x27;t agree. However, my scalp seems to love this brand of jojoba oil. Since using this product on my scalp, my itchiness and dryness has been minimal. Additionally, I&#x27;ve produced less dandruff (it&#x27;s not completely cured of course). It is not a miracle oil by no means, but it is a great addition to my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> If only I would have purchased this instead of ALL of the other oils that people swore by! When I put this on my ends, my hair just absorbed it like a sponge. and seemed to repair itself instantly! This oil is very very fluid, and my Jamaican Black Castor oil is very very thick! So merging the 2 together was perfect!! If you aren&#x27;t careful you will use this bottle in 2 sittings. So mix it w/something. I really think this specific brand is also the highest quality. I probably won&#x27;t try another, but maybe. I squeeze it directly on my hair because it will instantly absorb into your hands! So use sparingly. A teeny tiny bit goes a longgg way! I highly recommend for 4bcd hair to nourish. And even 3bc to tame frizzies.</li>
    <li> love this and it&#x27;s organic. 2nd time I purchased it and will do it again</li>
    <li> Good stuff with out a dout. massage or other things it is what was needed ..and now we are hooked</li>
    <li> I like this oil, it performs well, but it is odorless and I miss the good smell of my previous jojoba oil. My husband had ordered the old one from a site that is no longer online.  That jojoba oil had the same frangrance of a shampoo i used years ago with jojoba oil in it. But I am still okay with this oil and will just add a little bit of essential oil if i want some frangrance.  I use it mainly for my hands, fingernails and to mix in with my body lotion for legs and arms.  I do occasionally put a few drops on my hands and run through my wet hair after shampooing.  I will re-order unless i find one with the old familiar fragrance.</li>
    <li> I use it in my bath or after bath and it takes my usually flakey dry skin and gives me a very soft and smooth feeling. Also my husband uses it since there is no perfumed scent.</li>
    <li> I tried to hold out on this review but couldn&#x27;t. I was skeptical at first because it seems impossible to find info on H&amp;B Oil Co outside of Amazon. I must say that I had made up my mind to only use Aura Cacia jojoba oil but after trying this, there is no comparison. This is, in my humble opinion, what it is all about. You do not have to use a lot at all, I have only tried it on my face so far and it feels great, better than coconut or any other oil or butter that I have tried. I don&#x27;t know what it is that makes this particular jojoba oil distinctive, be it cold pressed, organic and unrefined but it makes Aura Cacia seem like a different oil altogether. Why am I the second reviewer for this product, is it a new company?</li>
    <li> Came on time and as expected</li>
    <li> Very light and does what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
    <li> I use this oil, along with avacado oil, to wash my face and moisturize my skin and hair.  It works great and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Perfect and happy with content of bottle</li>
    <li> Love this oil shipping was fast pure it&#x27;s great on my stretched ears</li>
    <li> This jojoba oil is wonderful. I have switched to an entirely natural beauty routine, and this is a vital part of my daily regimen. It has never caused me to breakout, and it really, *really* helps during the winter months, when my skin becomes much drier. However, it is also great in the summer, when I tend to get a littler oilier. It actually helps to control oil for me. So happy with it!</li>
    <li> On time. good price. no problems!! A+</li>
    <li> I love it and very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I like it. Will order again. Just wish it was a bigger size. But lasted a good amount.</li>
    <li> Works so well for me. I love it. I use it to massage my ears and help lubricate them when I stretch my ears or change jewelry. It helps with my stretch marks as well.</li>
    <li> Shipped in a plastic baggy, sealed foiled top, and no spills. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Please consult a doctor before using oils on your face! I tried the OCM with this product, and it cause my entire face to break out, and I&#x27;ve been left with a face full of clogged pores even two months after stopping use. It&#x27;s the worst my skin has ever been! Now I&#x27;m seeing a dermatologist to correct the problem, who said to NEVER use oils of any kind on acne prone skin! Please ask a professional before using!</li>
    <li> My hair stopped shedding since I started using this oil.Since I workout everyday I have a dry scalp from washing my hair everyday.I started massaging Jojoba oil in my scalp after I take a shower and I rub Aragon oil on my ends to keep them moisturized.Jojoba oil is helping me grow my hair out fast and I feel a little more thickness to it.I was having hair loss and then I used this and I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.I just massage it in and put a shower cap on and leave it in for an hour everyday and its been making my hair feel good and look shiney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is its super greasey so beware.</li>
    <li> Not organic. Gave me and my kids a rash!</li>
    <li> I love the product, however, I had gotten lazy about applying it everyday and my face is saying tisk, tisk.  If you have dry skin, you will notice this working within the first week to reduce the appearance of fine lines.  I need to get back to using this again because it was showing results I was seeking.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best Jojoba oil I have used. I just love it. I use it on my scalp and hair and also my face and body before bed. It has cleared up my dandruff problem. My hair is moisturized and shinny with less shedding. My face feels like silk. My legs which usually have white scaly dry skin are soft and silky. My heels are soft without cracks now. In the winter my hands are dry and in the past I have used lotions but have to repeat it every hour or so. With this Jojoba oil I just rub a few drops on my hands and it lasts all day. I put it on at night also and wake up with soft silky hands. I use it after a hot shower all over my body. In the shower I uses several drops to wash my face and neck. It stays on and I don&#x27;t get that tight itchy feeling like I do with soap. I put a few drops on my scalp and ends of my wet hair. My hail combs out without shedding and is silky and not oily when I uses just several drops. I never want to be without this amazing product. I bought the large bottle and am very glad I did.</li>
    <li> This has absolutely no smell and feels wonderful on the skin.  It is a great quantity for the price, too!</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair nice and soft after I use it and it seems to work well as a carrier oil. My cat licked the spoon I used to measure it with--not sure what that means.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that good for my skin...</li>
    <li> Great oil, just needed more! Bottle should be bigger.</li>
    <li> The oil itself seems to be okay. I tried using it as a part of my moisturizing routine, I&#x27;m on Accutane and my skin gets very dry. But it was still a bit too comedogenic for me. It is generally listed at either a 1-2 comedogenic rating. The term &#x27;comedogenic&#x27; isn&#x27;t regulated, so it will vary. But it said to get virgin cold pressed to have the best chance of less pore clogging. It did do a good job at moisturizing, it just made me break out at well. But I&#x27;m on accutane, so I obviously have very troublesome skin. It has a very nondescript smell, just a sortof...oil smell. Not nearly as strong as olive oil or something similar. Nearly odorless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My real complaint is the bottle design. The top has no dropper or pour spout, it just comes out. This gets very messy when you want to pour out any amount. I was just taking my finger and sticking it in to apply the oil, but what happens when it gets too low? I&#x27;ll have to pour it into my palm or a vessel and then have to wipe up after every time. I&#x27;m going to be using this on my hair instead of my skin.</li>

    <li> This is my nightly moisturizer for my nails and cuticles. I&#x27;m having great results!</li>
    <li> Bought this product in February &amp; only now having to buy again (September). I use it as a make up remover at the end of my day &amp; it works great. No break outs, leaves my skin feeling smooth, takes off waterproof mascara, and a little goes a long way. Outstanding quality.</li>
    <li> This is a very good oil for cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> Jojaba Oil Golden Pure Organic Carrier... is light in color and fragrance- barely  there. It is used in combination with other oils for skin moisture sealant.</li>
