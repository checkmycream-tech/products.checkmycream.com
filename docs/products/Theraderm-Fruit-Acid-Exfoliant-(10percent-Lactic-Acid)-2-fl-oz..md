      <li>Love this product!!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
      <li>I have always had what I would call good skin</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!  </li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>So glad I did  a search on Amazon and found a good place to buy it.</li>
      <li>Fine lines disappeared and I had an all over glow!</li>
      <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;i still have huge pores and oily skin, but it&#x27;s by far the best product for reducing blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
      <li>Perfect for reducing brown and red spots on skin.</li>
      <li>That cancels out many of the acne products out there, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
      <li>Someone already noticed my skin looks better  and</li>
      <li>My face is smoother and more even-toned than it has been in years.</li>
      <li>I use it most every morning and find discernible difference in the texture of my face before and after use.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love Theraderm products.</li>
      <li>Love this product....</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
      <li>Love this fruit acid, using it morning and evening.</li>
      <li>but I was glad I found it on Amazon as I&#x27;m sure it would have been much more costly at the doctor&#x27;s office and</li>
      <li>This stuff after one night will make skin smother and more radiant.</li>
      <li>But since my face is the most visible, I am super super happy that this works.  </li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like so many lactic acid products do, this is truly great!  </li>
      <li>I love it makes your skin look great 2nd bottle</li>
      <li>But after two minutes i felt fine.</li>
      <li>Great daily exfoliant.  </li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I even put it on my eyelids to make them smooth if they get scaly.</li>
      <li>Keeps skin smooth without peeling.  </li>
      <li>I have used.my first bottle lasted about 6 months be sure and try it</li>
      <li>because of all the good reviews I read, I expected more from this product.</li>
      <li>The skin on my face used to be super oily.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as ordered...thank you!  </li>
      <li>judging from the other reviews, it sounds like it&#x27;s a good price.  </li>
      <li>Since I received this originally as a sample, I have no idea how much it should have cost</li>
      <li>I put it right in my eye and it burned for a while.</li>
      <li>It is easy on sensitive skin and does not cause drying.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had more compliments on my complexion since I started using this product, so not only can I tell the difference, but others can too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle of it and love the results.</li>
      <li>and I definitely have a nice youthful glow/radiance to my skin which I most definitely did not have prior to using this product.</li>
      <li>In addition to that, my skin is SUPER sensitive.  </li>
      <li>i have large pores and oily skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it is much less pronounced and my fine lines are MUCH more reduced and in some areas completely undetectable.  </li>
      <li>Felt fine the next day, too.</li>
      <li>It is MUCH firmer</li>
      <li>I could use 6+ of those oil absorbing sheets in a day and STILL have a greasy face.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried acne medications (prescriptions) as well as antibiotics, but who wants to be on antibiotics for the rest of their life?  </li>
      <li>they are much tinier.</li>
      <li>I originally was given this product as a trial sample (I received the entire set - face wash, exfoliant, repair lotion and moisturizer) at a doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several different toners and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
      <li>Because as soon as the 3 month period is up, my acne comes right back.  </li>
      <li>(This also comes in a combo pack apparently, and I&#x27;m sure the combo pack has other products to help with redness, blackheads/whiteheads, but I haven&#x27;t tried any of that.)  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend you give it a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Keeps my face hydrated and clear.</li>
      <li>Just to be clear, I do not use ALL of the products that came with the sample.  </li>
      <li>Then I put this product directly on my face.  </li>
      <li>it has completely changed the texture of my skin.  </li>
      <li>After two nights of use you will be soft like a baby.</li>
      <li>I first bought it from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office, which is more expensive than Amazon.</li>
      <li>only 1/4 of bottle is used so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only 23 years old, but I have struggled with aggressive acne since I was about 13.  </li>
      <li>Now this product hasn&#x27;t done very much in the way of helping with blackheads or whiteheads, and unfortunately, I have acne in spots other than just my face which I&#x27;m sure this product could clear up, but then the product would be gone in the blink of an eye.  </li>

<li> I seriously can&#x27;t rave enough about this product.avail.  </li>
<li> My complexion had grown dull over the last few years and this changed that!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this exfoliant for a few years now along with the pads sold by theraderm as well.</li>
<li> (The bottle recommends that you put it on a cotton ball and dab on your face, but I feel like that&#x27;s a waste of product.)  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m talking, I use any type of Benzoyl Peroxide product, and the next day my face is swollen, red, and painful to touch.  </li>

<li> I don&#x27;t think this product is horribly expensive especially compared to some products on the market today.  </li>
<li> that&#x27;s how lazy I was!</li>
<li> In Addition the smell of the exfoliant is quite bad, so I only used it over night.</li>
<li> quite frankly I always refused to spends hundreds of dollars on crazy products.  </li>

    <li> i have large pores and oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;i use this twice a day every day.&lt;br /&gt;i still have huge pores and oily skin, but it&#x27;s by far the best product for reducing blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not a miracle worker. i still have them.&lt;br /&gt;but they are much tinier.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  A plastic surgeon recommended it to me for a dewy complexion ,it does it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exfoliant for a few years now along with the pads sold by theraderm as well. I use it most every morning and find discernible difference in the texture of my face before and after use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it. I first bought it from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office, which is more expensive than Amazon. So glad I did  a search on Amazon and found a good place to buy it.</li>
    <li> A recommendation from a friend, I purchased Therederm Fruit Acid. What a great exfoliant! My face is smoother and more even-toned than it has been in years. I&#x27;m on my second bottle of it and love the results.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Your face feels so goid after applying.  You&#x27;ll be amazed by the results.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I love it!  My complexion had grown dull over the last few years and this changed that!  I noticed the results immediately!  Fine lines disappeared and I had an all over glow!</li>
    <li> As soon as you put it on, you can feel your skin tingle and you know it is working. Someone already noticed my skin looks better  and only 1/4 of bottle is used so far.</li>
    <li> I love it makes your skin look great 2nd bottle I have used.my first bottle lasted about 6 months be sure and try it</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after about 4 weeks and have continued using this product.  It is easy on sensitive skin and does not cause drying.</li>
    <li> Love Theraderm products.</li>
    <li> Introduced to this product by my plastic surgeon.  Great daily exfoliant.  Keeps skin smooth without peeling.  Best price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this exfoliant for a decade now and it has improved the texture of my skin dramatically. I have combination skin and even psoriosis in small amounts. This stuff after one night will make skin smother and more radiant. After two nights of use you will be soft like a baby. I even put it on my eyelids to make them smooth if they get scaly. It is always gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I once mistook it for contact solution, though. I put it right in my eye and it burned for a while. But after two minutes i felt fine. And didn&#x27;t take that contact out either. Felt fine the next day, too.</li>
    <li> Exactly as ordered...thank you!  Love this product.... I&#x27;m 42 and this makes a big difference in my complexion.!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 23 years old, but I have struggled with aggressive acne since I was about 13.  In addition to that, my skin is SUPER sensitive.  I&#x27;m talking, I use any type of Benzoyl Peroxide product, and the next day my face is swollen, red, and painful to touch.  That cancels out many of the acne products out there, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I&#x27;ve tried acne medications (prescriptions) as well as antibiotics, but who wants to be on antibiotics for the rest of their life?  Because as soon as the 3 month period is up, my acne comes right back.  My aunt recommended this product to me.  I LOVE IT!  Before I apply this to my face, I use Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Cleanser.  Then I put this product directly on my face.  (The bottle recommends that you put it on a cotton ball and dab on your face, but I feel like that&#x27;s a waste of product.)  My acne is gone (on my face).  Now this product hasn&#x27;t done very much in the way of helping with blackheads or whiteheads, and unfortunately, I have acne in spots other than just my face which I&#x27;m sure this product could clear up, but then the product would be gone in the blink of an eye.  But since my face is the most visible, I am super super happy that this works.  (This also comes in a combo pack apparently, and I&#x27;m sure the combo pack has other products to help with redness, blackheads/whiteheads, but I haven&#x27;t tried any of that.)  In addition to this helping my acne, the skin on my face is also drastically less oily.  (Actually, it can get a little dry now, so I have to use a moisturizer.)  The skin on my face used to be super oily.  I could use 6+ of those oil absorbing sheets in a day and STILL have a greasy face.  (Gross, I know).  But this product has helped with that also.  I&#x27;ve had more compliments on my complexion since I started using this product, so not only can I tell the difference, but others can too.  I would recommend this product to anyone struggling with acne that has tried everything to get it to go away to no avail.  I seriously can&#x27;t rave enough about this product.avail.  I seriously can&#x27;t rave enough about this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Keeps my face hydrated and clear.</li>
    <li> Love this fruit acid, using it morning and evening. It&#x27;s clearing my skin and after couple weeks I notice my skin tone improvment.</li>
    <li> it is sold by a plastic surgeon friend of mine from Arkansas and my wife has used it for years</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like so many lactic acid products do, this is truly great!  Will definitely buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I can tell a difference in my skin quality after only 3 weeks of application.  My skin is smoother and has an added glow-several people commented that my skin looks wondeful!  Can&#x27;t beat that at age 54!</li>
    <li> I originally was given this product as a trial sample (I received the entire set - face wash, exfoliant, repair lotion and moisturizer) at a doctor&#x27;s office.  It sat for about 6 months before I tried it because I&#x27;m not a products girl and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the \\&quot;routine\\&quot; involved with having to use several products on a daily basis and quite frankly I always refused to spends hundreds of dollars on crazy products.  I have always had what I would call good skin and I have only ever used soap (antibacterial soap at that) to wash my face and a simple moisturizer.  I never even used sunblock that&#x27;s how lazy I was! Well I noticed my skin texture was starting to change (I&#x27;m 47 now) and my jawline was starting to get a little slack so I though what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  This product is amazing!  In a very short time (I&#x27;m talking about a week) it has completely changed the texture of my skin.  It is MUCH firmer and I definitely have a nice youthful glow/radiance to my skin which I most definitely did not have prior to using this product. Obviously this product is not plastic surgery in a bottle, my jawline is still somewhat slack but it is much less pronounced and my fine lines are MUCH more reduced and in some areas completely undetectable.  Just to be clear, I do not use ALL of the products that came with the sample.  Only this exfoliant.  I have now switched to using Neutrogena soap and I use this Fruit Acid Exfoliant and the same simple moisturizer as before.  I don&#x27;t think this product is horribly expensive especially compared to some products on the market today.  Since I received this originally as a sample, I have no idea how much it should have cost but I was glad I found it on Amazon as I&#x27;m sure it would have been much more costly at the doctor&#x27;s office and judging from the other reviews, it sounds like it&#x27;s a good price.  I highly recommend you give it a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Perfect for reducing brown and red spots on skin. Was recommended by my MD</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different toners and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
    <li> because of all the good reviews I read, I expected more from this product. My skin didn&#x27;t change or improve in any way. In Addition the smell of the exfoliant is quite bad, so I only used it over night.</li>
