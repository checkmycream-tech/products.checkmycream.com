<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this for my brother in law and he&#x27;s already noticed a big difference in his beard.  Usually it&#x27;s all over the place and with this oil it&#x27;s tamed the beard!</li>
    <li> my son used this and he loves it.  He said it made his beard soft and manageable</li>
    <li> Got this for my friends beard. He has been using it for a little while now. Doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy smell and feels a little bit softer.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great quality product</li>
    <li> Great smell, not oily but leaves a subtle gloss for healthy shine!</li>
    <li> Loved the burlap little baggie it came in. I gave this as a gift and the recipient loves it!</li>
    <li> Does exactly as it says! This time if year, right after winter, and again during summer, then just before winter, my beard gets itchy, this oil has helped moisturize my skin inner my beard, relieving the itch! LOVE Smooth Viking, and recommend to anyone with a beard to buy their products! I have the Beard Conditioner, Beard Balm, and now the Beard Oil... What a great combination of beard care products!</li>
    <li> Really made a difference on my beard. As it gets longer and starts to curl in places you don&#x27;t want, this helps keep everything in place. Love the smell as well. Noticeably softer as well. Makes it easier to push thru that awkward stage when trying to really get some length on your beard.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this product, it soften his beard, and made it easier for him to comb through. I like like how his beard feel, it was so soft. I will be buying this for him.</li>
    <li> Packed with conditioning ingredients like jojoba oil, grapeseed oil and argan oil IMHO essential for maintaining facial hair. Cost effective and not burden by unnecessary &#x27;fluff&#x27; ingredient(s).</li>
    <li> My husband is so excited and cannot wait to try this product.</li>
    <li> The first time my husband used this, he immediately fell in love with this beard oil. He&#x27;s been trying to grow his beard and this is helping him maintain a very well-groomed looked. It has made his beard feel a lot softer. He didn&#x27;t think that his beard was that harsh and scruffy, but after applying a few drops of this beard oil, he noticed a significant difference in the way his beard felt. He uses it every day and unconsciously plays with his beard throughout the day because of how it feels, It leaves a very light fragrant smell. A few drops is all you need. As a product tester, I purchased this on promo for my husband. He loves it and continues to use it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend who hasn&#x27;t been able to find beard oil that he’s happy with. After using Smooth Viking for a few days, he told me that this was the product that he’d been looking for. He loves the all-natural ingredients and that it’s very moisturizing.  He found that only a few drops are needed to give his beard a healthy shine. The dropper was a plus for ease &amp; mess free use. Since a little oil goes a long way, this bottle will last him awhile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not using it for my beard....but for my badly damaged hair. Works great and makes my hair feel incredibly soft. Smells ok...but it I guess because it&#x27;s meant for a man. Either way I would recommend it to anyone wanting soft hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, smells great!</li>
    <li> Received quickly and hubby loved the product!  Smells great, no greasy feeling, and softens right away!</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Despite its name it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling in your beard and I usually use more than the recommended 3 drops without any issue.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend! totally controlled his wild beard and made it look thicker!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! It makes your beard look and feel very healthy!!</li>
    <li> Definitely has that &amp;#34;swing low sweet chariot&amp;#34; ole naturale smell to it. Only takes a few minutes to get used to because this will soften and shine up your beard quickly. You&#x27;ll look like the majestic spawn of Odin himself in less than ten minutes.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this so far. There is no smell, just a natural smell. He really likes the way it makes his beard feel.</li>
    <li> This is the first and only beard oil i have tried. At first I must say I was very skeptical about &#x27;beard oils&#x27; effectiveness. I purchased this particular beard oil after a lot of research and reading tons of reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say that this beard oil is very effective. The smell of the oil is very slight but good. Only after using the oil twice I can already feel my beard hair have gotten softer. After about five times of using it i can see that it made a difference in taming the stray hairs. This oil also gives your beard a very slight shine. Not a big shine to make you look like you use product, but enough to make you look sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> I bought for my husband and after 2 uses you could feel the difference in his beard, it was softer and smoothed out a bit. I would have never thought to buy &amp;#34;beard oil&amp;#34; but i am glad i did its very useful especially if you have to settle for your husband wanting to grow out a beard lol.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get used to but now he loves it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and his review is that he likes the product, but it is a little runny, but doable.</li>
    <li> I always get itchy about 5 days into growing out my beard and this product completely took that away my fresh beard is smooth and soft and my skin feels great. 5 stars</li>
    <li> He loved the oil!! Smells great and a small amount goes far.great buy !</li>
    <li> All natural which was a concern&lt;br /&gt;This oil has made 100% difference&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to keep in stock</li>
    <li> Got for my son and he was skeptic but using it he ordered more&lt;br /&gt;I liked the little canvas bag it came in</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband, his review is as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil smells nice, left a nice shine to it and helped tame the beard.</li>
    <li> Husband likes it &amp; it has a very light (not over-powering) smell. I think it makes his beard look smoother and not so frizzy &amp; messy.</li>
    <li> Great neutral smell, quick shipping, applies great.  Can&#x27;t wait for your guys to expand the oil brand into other scents!  Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Hubby has no complaints so it must be good.</li>
    <li> My husband likes how easy it is to use this beard oil as he just places a few drops in his hands and rubs into his beard. It leaves his beard soft and manageable. It doesn&#x27;t make it hard or crunchy. His beard has a healthy shine to it and its not greasy. His likes the fact that it comes with a dropper to make using it easier and mess free. I received this for a discounted price in exchange for my review, good or bad. I was not paid or sponsored for my opinions all thoughts reflected in this review are my own.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Nice earthy aroma. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> I actually use this on my hair and it made it so so so so so.....etc shiny and healthy looking&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m def getting some more once this one is done 😍😍😍</li>
    <li> This beard oil is intense. My beard was as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind as I stroked it riding on the back of my dragon. It&#x27;s not just beard oil, it&#x27;s Viking Beard Oil. I&#x27;m pretty sure just putting it on made my beard grow a few inches, not to mention how soft and yet manly it became. Buy this oil, learn how to ride dragons, and become a viking!</li>
    <li> Works good, brings out colors.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gag gift for my bearded friend. It was a huge hit! He even uses it and has likes the effects.</li>
    <li> I received the beard oil last night. My facial hair is very thick and gets itchy after a week of not shaving. I put the oil on my week old beard last night after I showered. The oil felt light. I woke up in the morning and my itchiness was gone. This oil works and doesn&#x27;t make your face feel oily!</li>
    <li> I love my husbands beard.  The only thing wrong with it is it is very rough.  It gets really dry and itchy for him also.  This oil has been a life saver.  I am sad we did not have this during the winter months when his skin was very dry.  The oil is very easy to apply.  It comes with a glass dropper that gives you the exact amount you need.  The smell of the oil is not great but it does not bother us in any way.  The serum is not sticky or oily.  My husband massaged it into his beard and about half hour later made me touch it so I could feel how smooth it mad it.  He has been using it for the past 3 days and really likes the way it makes his skin feel. It is more hydrated and not itchy. Anything that makes my husband beard look good I am all for it.</li>
    <li> Technically, growing a beard requires nothing more than a face, swarthy genes, and time. However, there are a few additional items you’ll need to maximize your beard’s potential. Beard oil, for example, can keep your mane soft and help stave off unwelcome itchiness. A good beard oil is especially important during the winter months, when cold winds can make your beard brittle and your skin dry. You don’t want just any product, however; you want the best beard oil there is. That’s where Smooth Viking&#x27;s beard oil comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made with Avocado Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Moroccan Argan Oil, Olive Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Castor Oil, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E and Pure Essential Oil. These oils moisturize and replenish damaged hair, smooth itchy skin below, and most importantly ( as the girlfriend of the guy that uses this) softens rough scratchy beards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The essential oils are subtle but there is a slight fragrance that I would describe as clean, woodsy, and mysterious. There&#x27;s just enough so that when someone is close enough, they&#x27;ll want to lean in and get a better sniff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love how this has a glass dropper - makes this neat and easy even for those with butterfingers. It arrives gift packaged in a burlap drawstring bag with a hanging gift tag, making this the perfect gift for Father&#x27;s Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> it gets the job done, it nice little tool in the kitchen to help keep bread nice</li>
    <li> My husband loves this beard oil, and it smells really good!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 37 yr old son who has recently grown a beard. He really likes&lt;br /&gt;it..likes the way it smells too.&lt;br /&gt;As usual, it arrived when it was scheduled to. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> my hubby beard is so soft after using this beard oil</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Got as a gift for my boyfriend, it is a great product... Smells ok too!!</li>
    <li> I thought that my boyfriend would like this, as he&#x27;s been using my hair conditioner to try to tame his beard. It is a great conditioner and a little goes a very long way. 2 or 3 drops has his beard looking and feeling amazing. It has no &amp;#34;fly-aways&amp;#34; and just looks clean and sophisticated. An extra bonus is that he can rub the product into his skin beneath his beard and combat the dry skin he suffers from. He does like the scent and it dissipates rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> His beard smells great, even after working all afternoon. It feels weird at first, but I imagine that&#x27;s because of how coarse his beard is. Super stoaked for the end result!</li>
    <li> This beard oil is easily the best I have used. Worth every penny. It has made my beard softer, more manageable and dandruff free.</li>
    <li> I received a discount on this product to give my honest opinion. I gave this to my husband to try. I always love it when he grows a beard, I just don&#x27;t love how it feels. With this it feels very soft. He loves this because it makes it easier to comb and since it is soft he is not irritated as much. He says that it makes the skin underneath his beard super soft as well, without being greasy. He puts a little in his hair as well, it tames his flyaways and keeps his hair soft. Overall, he really likes this and so do I.</li>
    <li> I bought this beard oil for my Son and he really likes it. He enjoys the softness that he gets with his beard. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My husband has quite the impressive beard and has used this product a few times. It doesn&#x27;t leave his beard oily at all an has a great smell to it too. We also have a child whom is 15 months old she has a very very dry scalp and have asked her doctor what a good remedy to use is. We had tried coconut oil, along with eczema shampoos and nothing has really seemed to help. She did recommend trying a avocado oil which is the first ingrediant in this product, and this is 100% natural. It has improved his scalp dryness a lot. great product we will re order!</li>
    <li> I have tried many beard oils in the past and was always disappointed. So when I decided to try this product out, I was a little bit hesitant. But after using just a couple times I was highly satisfied. My beard is defiantly much more softer to the touch and can even be noticed. Smoothing Viking makes several great products and this is my third one of them to try and I have never been disappointed. They use all natural ingredients and that is why I think they work so great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells great- fun packaging for a gift.</li>
    <li> Me and my husband have tried both the conditioner and beard balm by Smooth Viking. I have to say this really does work great with them because on top of those two keeping your beard looking great and feeling soft, this helps keep it healthy and dandruff free. He generally applys this to his beard after he uses both the conditioner and beard balm.However I would recommend dampening your face before applying, because he did not do this before applying the first time and it took a little longer then it should have. Also, after seeing a few comments of people getting a rash from this I can not say my husband has! I would highly recommend this product and any other of Smooth Viking&#x27;s Products!</li>
    <li> This really a wonderful product! It is the second Viking Beard product my husband had tried and he is very impressed. You just need a few drops to massage into your beard and skin to leave it soft, shiny, and manageable. It has really helped to keep his skin healthy, too!</li>
    <li> Product does work, it&#x27;s really just a essential oils blend with some addictions. Doesn&#x27;t have the best of smells.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several beard oils in the past but have never been satisfied. I have a problem with dry skin and itching. I had the chance to try the beard oil by Smooth Viking and love it. I love that the ingredients are all natural. My beard is now soft and manageable and I no longer itch. Even though this is a small bottle, a little bit goes a long way. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this! I love it on him!</li>
    <li> Son tried this product and said it was good. He said it made his beard feel softer.</li>
    <li> This product did seem to work well but my boyfriend wasn&#x27;t fond of the scent. I thought it was very faint and not unpleasant, you couldn&#x27;t smell it until you were pretty close up</li>
    <li> My husband used this a few times and was not a fan.  He also doesn&#x27;t usually use stuff on his face or beard, so he may just not be use to it.  I will probably use it to moisturize the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this when he is going to sleep much like I put on face cream.  It gives him soft, kissable beard.  Now its much better to snuggle up to him without his beard stickling me.</li>
    <li> This is great, my husband uses this and he likes it a lot! It makes his beard lively.</li>
    <li> This beard oil is great.  The smell isn&#x27;t really strong but it makes my beard soft.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> My husband is a big fan of this product. His review: &amp;#34;Strong initial smell, but not overbearing. Left beard feeling less frizzy and out of control.&amp;#34; A win, and a definite keeper.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 05/20/2016: I am not sure if I will continue to buy Smooth Viking because they changed their formula in the last few months.  The new formula has an added fragrance which smells like very cheap after shave which was NEVER in the product before.  They also changed the formulation of the ingredients, whereas Olive Oil is now the prominent base oil although it used to be Avocado Oil, and they ADDED Safflower Seed Oil and added less Castor Oil (which is now labeled Ricinus Communis instead of Castor Oil).  I miss the old formula that smelled faintly like pumpkin-sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value for what you get, decent scent although my nose picks up more of the pumpkin than other oils.  Very nice packaging.</li>
    <li> Wonderful ingredients in this beard oil!  I gave this to my husband for a gift and it&#x27;s softened up his beard and made his kisses even more welcome.  ;)</li>
    <li> Great product, keeps the beard smooth with no flaking or girly smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for over a week now and i really like it, it makes my beard look very smooth and shiny. The best part of it is that its made out of natural ingredients and you know that it will not damage your beard. I have used other product and they had way too many chemicals in it. This is a perfect fit for me</li>
    <li> Got this for my brother. He was skeptical at first but after massaging in, he was impressed. It smoothed his beard out and moisturized the skin. I think I got him hooked. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> I bought the beard oil for my husband, and I appreciate it as well. His skin is less irritated, and softer. His beard is softer, and is continuing to grow in nicely. I think it smells nice too.</li>
    <li> A little messy, but the results are worth it; No itch and it softens your facial hair.</li>
    <li> I prefer the balm over the oil.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my bearded honey. I LOVE the smell. He&#x27;s used it twice so far and it&#x27;s already worked its magic. Love love love this. I think he does too!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. He was impressed with how much it works.</li>
    <li> This is some nice oil. Makes your beard silky smooth and soft. Helps prevent breakage also.</li>
    <li> Beards are all the rage again and my husband is at the head of the line. No one likes shaving but beards can be itchy and ruff.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been using Smooth Viking Beard Oil for 3 days now and he loves it and i love it. This product really takes the itch out and his beard is noticably softer and he says more managable. This all natural product is great for sensative skin types and leaves your beard smelling and looking great.Resonable price , great service , happy customer.</li>
    <li> Fantastic oil! Never really thought about adding an oil or conditioner to the beard, until I came across this product. On a whim I bought this for my husband. From the very first time her used it, it was great! It softened his facial hair and even helped with dry itchy patches that he had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is all natural and there seemed to be no reaction as far as allergies or skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend!</li>
    <li> My beard is so soft after using this oil. The dropper makes is really easy to dispense the right amount too!</li>
    <li> Smells a little weird - but makes the beard feel soft</li>
    <li> very good product, i use it everyday now</li>
    <li> Smooth Viking Beard Oil I got this beard oil for a promotion to try and I had my son give me his critique. Overall he really likes this oil but he said a little bit goes long way so start off with less then you think you need. Also he said it has a light nice scent.</li>
    <li> Got this Beard Oil for my hubby, he loves it, and NOW i do too!!!  It got rid of those icky white flakes!  LOVE this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Hubby beard became soft using this. He does not have itchy problem so I am not sure about that part.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND LOVED THE PRODUCT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> Does the trick. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. It really softens his beard and is not too oily feeling. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Great oil has diffidently soften my beard and also help with my skin too..good product will order again..</li>
    <li> I gave this to a friend&#x27;s husband and he&#x27;s only been using it for a few days, but he said he likes it so far. Beard oil is a new hipster thing, but maybe it&#x27;ll smooth out those scratchy facial hairs; anything that&#x27;ll help!</li>
    <li> My husband has naturally just bad skin... gets rashes, eczema, has dandruff, you name it.  Part of why he grows a LOT of facial hair is b/c his skin can&#x27;t handle regular shaving.  His mustache is the worst by far though, with thick flakes that leave very red, tender skin behind, and it&#x27;s not very attractive to boot.  This beard oil was just something I randomly saw as an Amazon suggestion when purchasing essential oils, so I thought I&#x27;d buy it for him.  He&#x27;s been using it for almost a month now, and reports significant improvement in his skin under his mustache and &amp;#34;soul patch&amp;#34; areas.  :)  :)  Not to mention, it&#x27;s hard to get him to remember to use any kind of product beyond soap and deodorant, but this sucker is left out on the vanity daily, so myproof that it&#x27;s working is that he&#x27;s now very motivated to use it, after getting relief on his skin.  Seems like we will be back to buy more when he runs out.  Guessing it will last him about six months of very regular use.  He does not run it through his long beard, really just uses it at the skin level.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my husband&#x27;s beard look. It makes it much softer.</li>
    <li> My dad loves this product he enjoys using it on his beard.</li>
    <li> This is going to read like a backwards review but I buy this product for preventing razor burn and keeping my skin smooth and soft AFTER shaving my bikini area. Without it I get an awful rash every single time I shave that area. But, being the frequent host of several relatives with questionable hygiene who posess bushy mountain-man beards  (I often see last nights dinner still in their beards at breakfast, and sometimes lunch the next day) I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be long before one of their chubby hands got a hold of my bottle of beard oil. I was surprised to see what one cousin was doing with it though, which was taking the full dropper and digging it deep into his beard so that the tip would touch his face, and applying little bits of the oil all over his cheeks and chin. It&#x27;s a good thing the dropper is super durable cause Grizzly Adams is not gentle and his beard is like a Brillo pad. Only after he dabbed his entire face did he put some in the palm of his hands and rub it on the actual beard, removing what I assume was days worth of food in the process. Afterwords I actually didn&#x27;t mind sitting downwind of him and asking why he was digging the dropper in like that and he said that he always used my Smooth Viking when he came to visit because it stopped the &amp;#34;beard itch,&amp;#34; which is really quite gross when I think about where I use it myself, and I know his beard has not been washed in years. This time I let him keep the bottle and ordered myself a new one.</li>
    <li> i love it and so does he!&lt;br /&gt;out of all the beard stuff he has tried, i ran across this and gave it a chance and we are both highly satisfied with this product, he definitely gets more kisses now, and i think it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;also the company hit my email up saying they would send me an additional bottle at no cost, which was fantastic customer service!!!</li>
    <li> Good product, hubby likes it a lot!  He puts it in his goatee and likes the way it makes it feel.</li>
    <li> Vary good beard oil one of my favorite&#x27;s I will order again love the smell leaves beard soft too.</li>
    <li> works great real smoooth</li>
    <li> Tried it out. It&#x27;s not bad as far as beard oil goes, but I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the smell. Luckily, this doubles as a shaving oil which is how I use it now. I put some on my neck when I&#x27;m trimming my beard neck line with my safety razor. Works great.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used beard balm before but I got a promotional code to try this stuff out and leave a review so I figured why not.  It leaves my beard soft and shinny, and has a light, clean smell that&#x27;s fine by itself, or could be easily covered up, if desired.</li>
    <li> Great scent!  Not oily leaves the beard looking great and soft!</li>
    <li> didnt realy notice a difference... was maybe a little softer?</li>
    <li> Smells clean and effective.  To The point and efficient can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> This is a nice beard oil and it smells great.  It is comparable the the $40 a bottle oil that he usually uses</li>
    <li> Helped my husbands beard lay flat and make it look much healthier!</li>
    <li> This is a good choice for the itchy faced fellow.  My husband has experienced some mild irritation since growing his beard this year and really likes this beard oil.  It&#x27;s not greasy and the smell is pleasant.  He says he&#x27;s had zero itchiness since using the oil.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been trying many beard oils over the last few months. I love the feel and natural smell of the Smooth Viking Oil. It apply&#x27;s nice and thick leaving a smooth feeling on my beard throughout the day.</li>
    <li> So far my husband havent feel the result yet for he have just applied it for 2nights. But he likes the feel of it and the smell is not overwhelming the oil is very suttle not too slimy</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I started using this product.  The skin under my beard was itchy and flaky.  But now I feel so much better.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husbe\and, it seems his beard is getting a little rough. He has been using it for a few days now after he trimms his beard and I have already noticed that it is softer and shinier now but it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel to it. After using the Beard oil he has a more groomed look to his beard. It does have a fragence but it is very lite and not really noticable once it it on his beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since he&#x27;s been using the beard oil it hasn&#x27;t broke out his skin at all.</li>
    <li> Left my husband&#x27;s beard smooth, soft and shiny.  Great seller, excellent product</li>
    <li> This is a great gift item for bearded friends, and it&#x27;s truly a fantastic product.  I also received excellent tips from the seller, as well. I am very pleased! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I got this for my brother to try.  He loves this oil! It has softened his beard and has made it healthier looking as well</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. He has been able to grow his beard out without having itchy or dry skin.</li>
    <li> Smells kinda piney, foresty. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long. I recommend using it with a comb to work it in. You may need more or less than what the bottle recommends due to your beard size. Use more for a softer beard, but be careful otherwise it will feel oily. You can use wax instead of something like this if you want your beard softer without the oiliness.</li>
    <li> I can definitely feel the difference using the Beard Oil.  My beard is about 5&amp;#34; long and I have been using about 6 drops each morning.  I enjoy the smell and had a few friends sniff test.  The consensus is the smell reminds people of sawdust.  I enjoy the smell and how soft my beard feels throughout the day.  Would recommend again.</li>
    <li> First of all, the little burlap bag that this product comes in is adorable (wife&#x27;s opinion)! Per my husband, this oil is good for a beard that&#x27;s being grown out and is past the stubble phase. It helps with the itchiness and keeps the skin moisturized and soft. This is oil, so a little goes a long way. The bottle will last a really long time. The ingredients are all natural, quality, and Made in the USA, which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> Has a really nice feel and just a slight hint of fragrance from the oils.  Makes me want to grow a longer beard.</li>
    <li> Great oil ...contains pure, healthy oils that smooth and condition, as well as smell great!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this product! Made his beard smoother after just two uses!</li>
    <li> Just gave this to my husband as a Merry Day gift and he loves it! One thing to note, a little goes a long way. His beard feels soooo nice since he&#x27;s been using this product.</li>
    <li> Ok, my beard is thick and coarse. It&#x27;s like I have a box of brillo on my face. This beard oil does the trick in keeping it healthy and keeping my skin from flaking under my beard. So no more beard dandruff for me! I&#x27;ve used it just twice, and my beard stays softer and has a nice scent to it after application. If you have a big beard, it will probably take you more than the recommend three drops, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> This is nice and smooth! My hubby loves using it after a shave</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he was very happy.  The packaging was cool as it came in a burlap sack and he liked the product.  I&#x27;m pretty sure he will be buying more in the future</li>
    <li> I got this Beard Oil on a promotional Price. So as soon as the package came&lt;br /&gt;I gave it my husband as a surprise gift, hahah and he loves the thought that it was a beard oil and its Natural since he loves growing out his beard which I really hate. So he was getting excited to using it the next day and he was actually pretty happy with the result as his beard became smoother he doesnt wanna shave it out hahah&lt;br /&gt;As long as hes happy!</li>
    <li> I love how this stuff make my husband bread feel great smelling</li>
    <li> Makes your beard feel really nice. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This oil nourishes your beard as well as your skin. It is even helpful if you do not grow out a beard but instead use it after shaving.</li>
    <li> My husband and I really like these products! The combination of the beard oil, balm and conditioner have made a great improvement to his beard.  He likes that they smell like cedar and that they help control the itching that is associated with dried out beard hair.  Personally it helps me not get tickled when getting too close for a kiss.  He has a very thick, coarse, and dark beard that was often dry so we were very excited for the opportunity to review this product in exchange for a discount.  This has brought the sheen back in his beard in only a few applications and actually made it appear a bit darker.  I&#x27;m assuming this is because it is better hydrated now.  Even though this is oil it didn&#x27;t leave him looking greasy, so it must absorb quickly and well.  I&#x27;m very impressed with this product line! All the products even came in handy little burlap bags which was a nice touch! My only warning would be to those who are sensitive to scents as it does have one, especially if you use the balm and conditioner in addition to this.  It definitely​ isn&#x27;t overpowering to me, but it is noticeable if you get close enough! (For me that is a plus!)</li>
    <li> Not bad, I really can&#x27;t tell the difference</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband, as I am not the bearded lady that travels. :) And he loves it. He has the curse of small patches of psoriasis and it really drives him batty under his beard. I thought that this might help soothe his beard and make his face 99% less itchy!! And, it looks like he owes me one. Because he has raved about how much smoother and kinder his beard has been. It comes with a dropper, in a glass bottle. All the ingredients are 100% natural....some include: Avocado oil, Sweet Almond oil, Argan oil, Vitamin E...and so many other wonderful ingredients. I happened to drop a few drops on my hands just to smell and feel the texture. It&#x27;s a yummy...soothing almond-y smell. The oil is not heavy or gunky. It blends and smoothes right into the skin. Refreshing! I might even sneak some out and rub it on my feet. It just felt THAT moisturizing. (And no I don&#x27;t have hair feet.) I&#x27;m so very thrilled as is my husband, that I was able to receive and review this product! Incredible! Oh and because packaging always makes an impression on me - this cute little 2 oz bottle comes in a drawstring burlap little bag. I really loved that. Ok - I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this oil. Leaves his moustache soft</li>
    <li> Very nice.  This is more for a fine texture of beards.  My husband and son prefer the beard balms over this oil. This is a little too thin for thick burly beards. However they were pleased with the scent and it worked well, just needed to be applied more often.</li>
    <li> This beard oil helps keep my beard looking healthy and it smells awesome! No bumps or beardruff here. 100% satisfied. My wife loves the smell. The blend and quality of oils you get for the price is very reasonable</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves it. He said it makes his skin feel soft and fresh</li>
    <li> I absolutely enjoy the product. After using conditioners in the past that weighed down my beard/facial hair, this is not one of them. The product goes on easy and after a few applications, I noticed a different in my beard. It was indeed a bit softer than before. It also has a pleasant smell which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Wife bought this for me and I swear by this stuff. Helps control course facial hair. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has been using this for a week and it has made all the difference! His usually unruly and tough beard has softened and has looked more sleek and put together (added bonus!). I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better it will get! he&#x27;s even said that his normally itchy beard has become more comfortable for him</li>
    <li> this stuffis great i love the feel</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s amazing.  I bought this for my husband who&#x27;s beard is rough and flaky (gross)&lt;br /&gt;He started to use it in the first day I notice it&#x27;s smoother and feels nice.  Also a lot nicer to kiss!&lt;br /&gt;And it smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loved it and loved the smell. It made his beard smell amazing and feel super soft.</li>
    <li> My dad loves this! Has helped tremendously with dry skin under his beard.</li>
    <li> Got it for my husband to start growing a beard.  He started using the oil from day one like suggested, so far so good.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! It&#x27;s the best brand around --- Will always buy this brand! Fast Shipping too!</li>
    <li> Works instantly! Out of all the Smooth Viking products, this is my favorite for my hubby. As soon as he applied this Beard Oil to his beard, it became a little softer. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it so that&#x27;s a bonus.  If you(or your man) has a rough beard, you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the smooth viking items but the oil is essential.</li>
    <li> Light and moisturizing</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great!</li>
    <li> loads of great ingredients! slightly masculine scent</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my nephew to use on his newly growing beard and his review was nothing but positive as he said it really helped with the itchies and dryness. I personally noticed the softer and better management of his beard. Good product with good results.</li>
    <li> Loved how soft this product made my beard feel. I have used others, but I wear a short beard for work purposes and seems like typical all these products work better on longer beards. This one did exactly what the description said it would and I would definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Pleased with this product. Softens beard and relieved  beard itch.  Product was also well packaged.</li>
    <li> Living in Brooklyn, I see a lot of guys walking around with massive beards and handle bar mustaches. If that&#x27;s your guy then this is for them or just for the guy who has a basic goatee (which is my favorite). These make nice grooming kit gifts. They are made from all natural ingredients like shea butter, beeswax, avacado oil, almond oil, mango butter and just everything that will make that lucious beard feel and smell like heaven. They come in these amazing little burlap sacks which makes a great gift presentation that looks expensive but, isn&#x27;t. i received this item for reviews. Opinions are completely my own as you can see...lol.&lt;br /&gt;Read more at http://arainofthought.blogspot.com/2015/02/valentines-gift-guide-2015.html#xTQ58KR7REB8kHcK.99</li>
    <li> Work as expected. Got item free would buy again</li>
    <li> This may sound a bit odd, but I use this as a cuticle treatment. I have looked at various treatment oils, and was unimpressed with their ingredients and when I came across this I really liked the ingredients, and it does a great job at maintaining your cuticles. So, ladies, we can use this also. :)</li>
    <li> I got this one for my inlaw and he really like it.</li>
    <li> awesome stuff. now my girlfriend can&#x27;t complain about sitting on my face</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because my beard gets brittle at a certain length and I was hoping this would condition it and allow it to grow longer.  The product comes well packaged in a burlap pouch, and has a very manly feel.  The good news, is that this product works exactly as designed.  The bad news, is that it has been usurped by my 18 year old...I will be getting another bottle for myself!</li>
    <li> Got this discounted for review. So far, so good but I need to use it longer to see if it makes a bigger difference. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband a he loved it!</li>
    <li> I got this for my Dad,&amp; he loves it. He says his beard is smoother/softer now,&amp; that he also doesn&#x27;t have the dandruff/flakes in his beard like he occassionally used to. It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
    <li> My husbands review -&lt;br /&gt;Great oil. Nice for the mornings when you are in a rush. Adds a good shine without being greasy, nice moisturizer, makes your beard more manageable but doesn&#x27;t add any hold. The reason for 4 star instead of 5 is the unpleasant smell. Also like the fact that it&#x27;s an all natural product.</li>
    <li> We have the oil, balm and conditioner.  Used together, these really pamper your beard and make it quite comfortable.  The products last a while.  It&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
    <li> My Hubby Loves this and uses it daily, states his beard is so much softer.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product a 4 and not 5 is because I didn&#x27;t actually use the product. I bought it for my brother as a gift and asked him later whst he thought. Which, he really liked! His comments where that it left no smell after applying and that it absorbed quickly!</li>
    <li> The husband and I love how it make his beard feel.  Soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Very mild scent, but still smells nice. Perfect for my husband. His beard is always scratchy, so I&#x27;m looking forward to it being much softer. After just a few uses, it already felt better to both of us. I&#x27;m also pleased with the natural ingredients. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it transferring on to me or anything else.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes his beard so soft!!!</li>
    <li> The oil is nice, handy to have around, not just for beards.</li>
    <li> I got this for my fiancé to use on his beard because he said it itched and he wanted to shave it off.  I like his beard, so I got this, and it worked!  Now we are both happy!</li>
    <li> Great oil. My husband loves his soft it makes his beard feel</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell. But does moisturize skin.</li>
    <li> Smells good and makes my boyfriend&#x27;s beard so soft.</li>
    <li> This oil works great!</li>
    <li> Hubby doesn&#x27;t mind the smell of this version and his beard has never looked better. Thanks for making it softer for kisses.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s beard was wirey and rough!! This is helping tremendously !! we love it!~!~</li>
    <li> If you have a long, rough, tangled beard then this is for you. It&#x27;s moisturizing on those rough beard hairs. Also was good on the skin.</li>
    <li> Four thumbs up! Four? Yes. Four. My guy being the one with the beard gave his input, as he was my test subject and intended recipient. We use it as a full regimen. He uses the conditioner first, then the oil at the beard roots, followed up with the balm. And given I am the one who gets to smell and touch too, I wager my thumbs count! Amazing products. We have tried many, this is sure to be a re-purchase!</li>
    <li> Great product. I ordered this for my brother who has decided to join the beard gang. He sometimes complains of it being itchy and he says this product has helped. He also said his beard is softer/more moisturized and the smell is pleasant. You also get a pretty good size product and it comes in a rucksack thing. Packing was nice and it arrived quickly. He says he would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome oil. Was a little funny smelling at first, but definitely helps with the beard. Thanks so much! Great product! Can&#x27;t wait for the conditioner!</li>
    <li> Good product,  nice to be able to try this out.  Boyfriend lives the smell and it makes his beard don&#x27;t and soft. Expected a little different based on other reviews, but I think is plenty manly and pleasant.</li>
    <li> It works and smells better than most beard products.</li>
    <li> Helps with beard control and also with the overall look/sheen</li>
    <li> This made a great gift. Perfect for anyone who wants a smooth beard!</li>
    <li> Lightweight oil easily dispenses with the dropper bottle.  Just a few drops, rubbed between the fingers then worked into the beard produced a wonderfully soft beard and tamed those flyaway or curly beard hairs perfectly.  Excellent Father&#x27;s Day Gift, we bought the balm, oil, and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other oil&#x27;s and this one seems to leave my goatee feeling the softest the scent isn&#x27;t to overpowering and smells clean my wife also really enjoys the softness and the clean scent I will definitely be buying more</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It has a subtle scent and absorbs quickly. As an added bonus, it makes his hands and cuticles soft. With each use, it makes his beard look and feel bettet and better.</li>
    <li> I like the oil. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but I&#x27;m happy with the results so far. I don&#x27;t love the smell, it&#x27;s not bad, but not great either.</li>
    <li> Great product makes my beard soft and manageable. I will always use this product. Thanks guys. Chuck</li>
    <li> I liked this oil. I&#x27;m a female with very kinky curly hair and used this oil as pre poo for my hair. I love the ingredients tht are in it. That&#x27;s what prompted me to buy it. The smell of the oil is kinda woodsy, of course, because it&#x27;s meant for a man&#x27;s beard. I don&#x27;t mind it, I&#x27;m washing it out any away. The oil really softened my hair and kept my moisture level up after shampooing it out. If bought for its purpose, it would definitely softened a man&#x27;s beard and/or hair.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this on his beard and he said it leaves his skin nice and soft, has a pleasant smell and leaves the beard soft!</li>
    <li> It seemed to work well but the smell was a little strange.</li>
    <li> Smooth Viking Beard Oil&lt;br /&gt;This oil has made my hubby&#x27;s whole face soft. These oils are super hydrating and my hubby&#x27;s face is just loving it.&lt;br /&gt;A nice side effect is that his hands are softer too. Well his fingertips. My husband has worked in construction for years and like most men he just doesn&#x27;t have soft hands. The beard oil that he applies goes on nice, spreads well and the rest soaks into his terribly dry finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this oil especially with Father&#x27;s Day coming up!</li>
    <li> Bought this for the boyfriend, he said the oil absorbed really well and had a great texture and feel, but that after a while it caused his skin to have a burning sensation most likely related to the essential oil. The bottle doesn&#x27;t specify what the essential oil is, but it smells like orange oil which can be very irritating and harsh to skin and would explain my bf&#x27;s bad reaction. It&#x27;s too bad because otherwise the ingredients are great and the packaging is nice as well, if this came in an unscented formulation it would get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this beard oil for some time now and I wanted to make sure we had a good knowledge of the product before leaving a review. It surely does the job it&#x27;s meant to - my husband&#x27;s beard is soft-to-the-touch and growing in much more nourished than it used to. He&#x27;s even getting many comments on how nice his beard looks! Helps with the dry skin of the winter time too!</li>
    <li> Its smell is good but i do not feel it makes different .</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It is not a overbearing scented oil.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:d92151d2024457e2dc6f56417be3e8f8]] This bottle is HUGE! Way bigger than any other bottle of beard oils that I have and it costs right about the same.&lt;br /&gt;I work out in the elements year round for the post office delivering mail and Beard oils are a must have for me.  The winter months are brutal on my skin under my beard but my beard helps keeps my face happy ...So beard oils are an everyday item I use.  I got this Beard Oil By Viking Blend to test and review and I am happy to report that this beard oil smells awesome and I have tested some down right funky blends in the past. After opening the bottle and getting a good smell I put it right in the beard without a second thought. It is a very light smell..I am not great on describing smells. Its just MANLY!  The oil itself is a medium blend and it did distribute through my beard pretty evenly. As with most oils, a little goes a long way..It did help with the dry skin over a period of time in the winter. After a few days it was feeling better. It somewhat made my beard feel softer but that&#x27;s no different than any other beard oils I have tried. The dropper is nice and the lid stays tight when closed. I have had some other brands leak out while I was traveling. Thats no fun to clean up. I have other oils I like and will keep buying and when this bottle runs dry I will buy another..For the price its a good beard oil that really helped with the dry skin and it is going on the top shelf with my best beard oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving the Beard Oil By Viking Blend for Men a 5 star rating for its nice clean, not to brutal scent, its ability to spread evenly and help with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe &amp; Happy Shopping!!&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample product to test and evaluate. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review.te my review.</li>
    <li> Aahhhh. The infamous beard oil! What does it do? What is it for? Well let me tell you my friends, it can do anything!! Not exactly, but let me describe the type of multifaceted function this beard oil has. Firstly, it actually has a lot of quality ingredients in it! In its appropriate size of 2oz, its got Avocado, Argan, and Almond oil! A trifecta of smoothly rich oils! These are the best types of oils you can have in a product that promises to moisturize. It definitely does. Let me also state that, the oil was not for me, it was for my other half, who recently decided that having a beard is just easier these days. Since I was able to score the product at a deep discount for the purposes of this review, I figured why not, Sir, escape my wrath this time. If he could not keep it moisturized, it was gonna have to go!! But I digress. So secondly, this is a pretty neat product. It will surely moisturize the beard, and will surely moisturize your hands whilst you rub it in. Using the dropper directly in the beard isn&#x27;t ideal I think, but rather you do have to rub it in. But it smells great (mostly like jojoba to me), and it for sure does not make the beard look grossly oily! Great product, will have to order it again. Happy thus far! Also, the packaging is just neat also! Little baggie is super convenient and not too frou frou for your manly man!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in a promotion. My husband was complaining that he wished his beard was softer (as did I), so I saw this and figured he could give it a try. The scent isn&#x27;t my favorite but it isn&#x27;t awful by any means. It really does help condition his beard and give it a slight silk feeling. I would recommend to any men and wives/girlfriends who have a man that they would like to have a more kissable beard :)</li>
    <li> OIL FOR BEARD EXCELLENT PRODUCT HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT,.</li>
    <li> I really like this bead oil and will be ordering it again for myself and for gifts to my other bearded brothers. I recommend this to anyone with a beard!</li>
    <li> Used in combination  with the Smooth Viking Beard Balm and it improved my beard, it feels softer and stopped itching, great product, also superb consumer support :)</li>
    <li> Wore this like a BOSS!!! ....until my wife made me shave my beard.....</li>
    <li> Tamed my wirey beard!</li>
    <li> Nice smell as well as makes a soft beard.</li>
    <li> Helps with skin irritation form facial hair.  I can go several days without shaving and avoid skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Makes my beard less itchy.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my dad, and WOW!  What a difference!  No more scratchy, itchy feeling for the grandbabies!  A complete WINNER!</li>
    <li> works well to soften my husbands beard</li>
    <li> My beard has never felt smoother and silkier.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift... he loved it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for a close friend. It came in a nice burlap bag. I was overall impressed with everything about this product. Will update once my friend tells me how it worked.</li>
    <li> This has cured any beard dandruff. Very pleasant scent. I have a short, but heavy full beard. Wife highly approves.</li>
    <li> Loved this beard oil I used it for 2 weeks now and it had reality made or adultery smooth.</li>
    <li> Great stuff -- wish I&#x27;d known about this sooner.</li>
    <li> Oil is the best I have ever had would recommend</li>
    <li> Great product! I noticed a discount code for this product. I bought it for my Hubby to try. It is great, his beard looks good and feels good.</li>
    <li> Throughly enjoyed this...was skeptical it would make a difference but it really does improve the feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Received a discount code to review this product.</li>
    <li> Other beard oils have better scents.</li>
    <li> I love this beard oil.  Great smell, but not over powering.  I personally think the droplet top is critical by allowing you to get the perfect amount every time.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my beard feeling oily, just soft and smooth.  After a few days of using it in the morning and at night I have received several compliments on my beard!  I would highly recommend this to anyone growing a beard from the smallest stubble to the greatest of beards. Great quality</li>
    <li> I got this because my ginger beard was becoming stiff and unmanageable. Within a week of using this every day, my beard became softer and much more easily manageable. The skin under my beard is very sensitive to anything I use on my skin (or beard) and tends to get scaly quite easily. This product has helped to eliminate that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as he complains of itchy beard when it is growing back. He said that the oil does not completely remove the itchy &amp; sore feeling but it helps a lot. It makes his beard smoother. He uses it everyday!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and can really tell the difference. Great product, but I am not a fan of the scent, so simply added a few drops of cedar oil and now am very happy. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> Exactly what me and my husband expected! It does wonders for his skin!</li>
    <li> Does a great job at keeping a longer beard manageable.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband. He loves it! Uses daily.</li>
    <li> This is a mildly scented product that is packed with excellent oils. The dropper is a very convenient way to get just the right amount of oil.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! My beard is very coarse and I use this and their beard balm and my beard feels a lot smoother. It also helps with itchiness. The odor is very enjoyable. Clean but manly.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> My husband has used 3 of the Smooth Viking products, including this one. He loves all of them and they have made a huge difference in his short beard.</li>
    <li> great smell. husbands beard looks and feels great</li>
    <li> This product is hard to use--especially when it comes to covering a large area. It was hard to &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; in and didn&#x27;t make the beard any softer.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for the hubby and he loves it! It works well and definitely makes the beard much less course and it actually makes it look fuller as well. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great gift for the bearded guy in your life! ;)</li>
    <li> This is a great soothing products for someone like my husband who is just not used to growing facial hair.</li>
    <li> I like it,  would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping! I ordered this for my partner and he&#x27;s already noticed a difference in just a few days. Softer hair is growing back and it&#x27;s less irritation for both of us and our skin.</li>
    <li> Great Product for taming and conditioning beards.&lt;br /&gt;already reordered.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Goes on smooth with a nice fragrance. The only thing I do not like is it stays oily and will transfer all over anything you touch and it seems to creep up all over your face</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product and we use it often</li>
    <li> Great product, Not only does it leave your beard looking nice and smooth but it made shaving easy. Your razor will just glide through.</li>
    <li> Smooth viking always has the best beard products, definitely a great purchase for the price, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Beard Oil. I&#x27;ve been really liking it. I&#x27;ve just starting growing out my beard for the first time and this product has been helping out a lot. It has great ingredients and no chemicals. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a bad fragrance to it.</li>
    <li> I have received this product free to review from the website Tomoson. This was sent to my brother, and he thought it was weird. The packaging that came with it smelled vaguely like pickles. It&#x27;s also expensive compared to other people such as honest amish. My brother was also not a fan of the graphics on the packaging because it&#x27;s not anything with a viking on it.</li>
    <li> My husband used this and he said it did help with the roughness of his beard after only a few days the smell though he was not a big fan of but works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he really enjoy this product</li>
    <li> Smells good, deep conditions your beard, and since you only use a few drops it&#x27;ll last for ages. What&#x27;s not to like? It even came packaged in a cool little burlap bag which pretty much means its prewrapped as a gift/stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend didn&#x27;t like the smell at all. It says unscented but it does leave a smell</li>
    <li> quick results, beard has thickens and feel much better.</li>
    <li> I bought this beard oil for my boyfriend who had a small and crunchy bread. I hate how his beard scratches my face. I had my fingers crossed that the oil would soften and tame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: faint pleasant smell, didn&#x27;t leave a greasy, film, smoothed out beard&lt;br /&gt;Cons: if you are sensitive to fragrance you may want to take caution although it&#x27;s faint it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product didn&#x27;t disappoint, it truly softens and tames the beard.</li>
    <li> Some women hate facial hair on men because it’s itchy, flaky, and messy. Believe it or not some men hate beards for the exact same reasons, but they continue to grow them. Growing and maintaining a beard doesn’t have to be hard. Smooth Viking Beard Oil is the ultimate product to keep beards from being a pain to all parties involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients such as Jojoba Oil, Pure Essential Oil, Vitamin E, Avocado Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Olive Oil, Castor Oil, Moroccan Argan Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil are a special blend from Smooth Viking. These ingredients will help soften even the hardest of beards. Use it for styling to keep every hair in place and to protect again beard dandruff.  Yes, beards can have dandruff. Itch because of the dry skin or just because hair makes people itchy can be soothed with this beard oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard oils don’t have to be messy! Three drops of this product is enough for most beards to benefit from this product. More beastly beards may need to a little more oil for each application. Rub the oil between your fingers and through the beard. You’ll be well on your way to stronger hair from root to tip and an easier to manage facial hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep beards strong and manageable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> this stuff works it actually made my beard a wole lot softer too!</li>
    <li> My husband hates growing a beard because of how itchy it is, which is unfortunate for me because I just love a good beard. This oil was easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and helped relieve the itch. His beard looks and feels healthier. On a side note, I&#x27;ve been using it on my cuticles and they look amazing as well. Absolutely worth a try. I love that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, packaged well.  You only use a few drops of this product so it should last a long time.  My husband&#x27;s beard always seemed rough and not very manageable.  Not any more!  It is soft and doesn&#x27;t seem to be &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; looking like it used to be.  The smell is pleasant as well.  He really loves this product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff,all natural.Smells even better than it conditions.Amazing.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for a few day&#x27;s now and he has mentioned that he does feel a difference when using all three of the products. It does not leave his beard all nasty and oily and not to soft he said it is just right.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my hubby and he loves it..He loves how it smells and how it feels on..Definitely worth buying for your man..</li>
    <li> This beard oil has worked wonders at softening my beard. I love the smell, too.  My beard has had an amazing feel. My wife loves it because it used to be so scratchy.  I love the price of this product, too.  Will recommend.</li>
    <li> This smells great and feels nice.  I really like that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients like avacado, almond, olive, and pumpkin oils (and more).  It comes packed really nicely for gift giving, too.  It comes in a little burlap bag inside of a cardboard box.  I like that the bottle is big and uses a glass dropper so there will be no deterioration of the dropper. It should last a while.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t anything to write home about,  not good but bot bad,  used it for one day and it was ok,  not $17 worth but for the $1 I paid ok.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  My husband is obsessed with this Beard Oil, he has used it every day since i gave it to him. His beard is much softer, you can even see the difference.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this oil. He seen results in a day. No itching and I can definitely vouch his beard is much softer. Easy to use dropper so it&#x27;s not messy at all. Also washes off hands easily.</li>
    <li> My husband started to grow his beard out and always itched really bad...i got this stuff and it has surpassed the itching a lot! he loves it and it makes his beard feel soft so it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin when kissing! This product has many many benefits!</li>
    <li> This has given my husband a soft beard, much nicer for smooching</li>
    <li> *THOUGHTS FROM MY HUSBAND ** A common complaint I hear from lady dental assistants when we talk about beards while the dentist fills a cavity is that beards are scratchy. Their husband grew one a bit, then it was not pleasant to the touch, and she decreed he must remove his manhood! (the beard I mean, in case you were confused). Sadly, at the time, I didn&#x27;t know of Smooth Viking Beard Oil to recommend, otherwise I would have. Then everyone could be happy. The husband, as he could have the beard he wanted, and the wife, would could enjoy that manly looking man she married, and the soft, snugly beard. Like all good things, sometimes it just takes a little effort to get from itchy beginnings to how things aught to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tested this beard oil, I put it on half my beard, and after it had soaked in, I left my wife feel and compare the sides, and not knowing which was which beforehand she correctly identified which I had applied the oil to. Well, she said &#x27;this side is softer&#x27;. I can&#x27;t say if this would be as effective on a fledgling beard, but on a full beard it works quite fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the oil to a beard is as simple as using the dropper to put 3 drops on your fingertips, then rubbing it into your beard. Not enough to cover your whole beard because it&#x27;s that fantastic? Just use a little more! I&#x27;m pretty sure you could have figured that out, but it&#x27;s printed on the bottle, in case you forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a beard? Get this beard oil. It works, and everyone will be happy. **This item was received for review**</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff love it!  Sellers are amazingly attentive as well.  All around great product and experience.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> BF Loves this! Beards are trending! 100% Natural Products, works well, doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it as recommended for a little bit now and I cant&#x27; tell much difference granted i started with quite thick, coarse facial hair.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son and he said that his beard is a lot softer now.</li>
    <li> Helping me prepare for the NHL playoffs</li>
    <li> Very hydrating oil, totally helpful for irritated skin...has made my chin improved after shaving...</li>
    <li> my nephew love this beard oil...bye bye dry and itchy beard ^_^</li>
    <li> So far my husband loves this. He has been growing a beard and it is super unruly. After just one application, its already tame and much softer. I am sure that it will get softer as time goes on (as the directions say). So far we love this product! It works.</li>
    <li> If you have a beard, I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a beard, maybe buy some just in case you change your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome stuff, 5 stars all around.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I was afraid of how it&#x27;d smell from reading the other reviews, but I love the smell.  It&#x27;s not fruity or feminine, it smells &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  I greatly enjoy this product and glad I ordered it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. He loves it. He says it makes his beard a lot smoother and lays down flatter. The scent can be a bit strong but its totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this beard oil for my hubby - he has been using it for a few weeks now and we both love it!  It is easy to use and it absorbs into the hair and skin easily.  The skin under his beard has always been itchy and red but now that he is using this beard oil that is a thing of the past!  This oil has helped heal the dryness so it is much softer.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My husband likes this product for his beard.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a friend as a retirement gift. He loves it. He said his beard is really soft since using this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  My beard is quite short, but I can tell it really makes it quite a bit softer.  I didn&#x27;t notice a smell to the product, which is either good or bad depending on what you want.  Overall great</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried a beard oil yet you need to try this one. The unique blend of oils are all natural and will leave your beard softer and more manageable. Your skin will also be less irritated as well. Complete the look with the bead balm to smooth and control your beard.</li>
    <li> I love this comes in a dropper. So you can drop the amount of oil you want on your skin. Now I have been using this for cuticles. It is softened them up. Which is nice due to the area I am in. The area of country can be finicky on my skin. I have been using this also on my leg hair. I have noticed that are not as stiff to shave. I have had the man in my life using this too and has reported it is easier to shave now. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> High quality natural ingredients, great packaging.</li>
    <li> Made my husband beard very smooth and soft. I don&#x27;t like the smell but he likes the smell. He did say that his beard seems like it is growing faster. I did get this to review. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> My item was delivered on time, it was as described, I recommend the seller and the item.....Must have.....</li>
    <li> Great product and works really well</li>
    <li> Does the job and smells good. Wish it would tame moe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my beard out for about 2 years now and always wanted to try out an oil I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks about every other day or every 3 days it keeps my beard soft and strong  it seems to strengthen my beard and ive only noticed because my 6 month old doesn&#x27;t leave with a fist full of beard so that&#x27;s a good sign. I will continue using and will update in a month or two.</li>
    <li> My husband has only used it once but he said he really likes it. It didn&#x27;t smell the greatest at first-- it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it also doesn&#x27;t smell good-- but the smell quickly dissipated. I look forward to see how it works long term.</li>
    <li> Love the scent! Great product</li>
    <li> My husband has had some trouble getting his beard to grow thicker. Within a couple weeks of using this beard oil it was thicker and so soomth and soft!</li>
    <li> Beard feels nice and smooth after applying this</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically a liquid version of their other products (minus the beeswax from their balm). I disagree with the directions of only using three drops and it makes no mention of apply it to a wet beard but it seems to have the best effect when using after a shower. As with the others it has a light floral/soap scent that doesn&#x27;t last long (I consider this a plus).</li>
    <li> This oil is made out of the same natural ingredients that many hair pills are made out of.  After adding a drop or two of lavender essential oil to each use, I am able to use this product on my hair to add a healthy shine and added manageability.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he could already feel the difference in softness after a few uses. It also has a nice smell to it.</li>
    <li> this is my new favorite beard oil.  it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent (okay by me).  one dropper full allows me to achieve my desired look without looking greasy (i had to use a lot more oil from different companies).  i have about 7 months of growth and this is my new oil of choice.  thanks smooth viking!</li>
    <li> This has softened my husband&#x27;s beard.  He likes it and I like how it smells.  Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Leaves beard soft &amp; very healthy looking. My beard is looking it&#x27;s all time best since using this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother in law who loves his beard!!  He can&#x27;t get enough of it.  He reports that his beard feels nicer on a daily basis and because of the all natural ingredients his skin isn&#x27;t reacting to it. H</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff and we really like the scent. It is very affordable and works really well. Doesn&#x27;t leave him feeling like an oil slick either because it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> it was wonderful one of the best products I have ever tried I highly recommended if I could read it more than 5 stars I would</li>
    <li> There are so many beneficial oils in this product that you can find so many uses other than beards.The smell is not strong,  Avocado Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Moroccan Argan Oil, Olive Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Castor Oil, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E and Pure Essential Oil. These are all great ingredients for skin and hair. Frankly, I will be using it on a regular basis on my arms and legs. It has all the ingredients to improve dry, itchy skin. Beards itch because of using shampoos and soaps that dry out the skin and clog the pores. This helps get that skin and hair softer and relieve the itchiness.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the beard oil.  It absorbs well and leaves his chin and beard moisturized without feeling oily.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for a couple days not and his beard is SUPER soft!! I love that I can kiss his face without worrying I&#x27;ll be stabbed by his rough facial hair! I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would have any affect on how his beard looks because his facial hair is black but it definitely looks healthier without looking greasy like so many other products have in the past. There is a nice citrus scent to it but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. Over all if you are a wife in need of relief from rough facial hair this product will be a life saver!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with it. Leaves his beard feeling really soft and manageable. Just takes a tab so go easy. I imagine this will last for quite awhile. Definately recomment.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever oil Ive used on my beard. I like the product, its natural and makes my beard feel so much more soft. The smell is something new to me. I got used to it within a week. Cant get enough of it!</li>
    <li> Doesnt smell, and its great</li>
    <li> my husband really enjoy ho..w this made his beard soft and that was with just one use..i would truly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This is my hysband&#x27;s favorite beard product. The oil is softens his beard and gives the hair a healthy shine (but not a feminine shine) and makes his beard more tame. A little goes a long way. We definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I ordered for my friend. He loves the quality and he told me that he will likely to buy this again.</li>
    <li> perfect for his dry frizzy beard</li>
    <li> Husband really likes it. Makes his beard nice and soft :)</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this and I think he smells of coconut when he wears it lol</li>
    <li> My husband really likes the smell of this product. It does help with the skin under the beard. No itchy beard, or dandruff under the beard. It makes the beard soft, but give it time to work. The softness doesn&#x27;t happen overnight. I know it&#x27;s Beard Oil, but the beard doesn&#x27;t stay oily. This would make a great bearded guy gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review. I&#x27;m a professional blogger that writes my own opinion.</li>
    <li> So really this is for hubby to use not me, but when we first received it for free* to try and review I helped him out because I wanted to also see what it was like for him to use. I think he enjoyed the impromptu beard massage. I dripped a couple drops on my fingertips rubbed the fingertips of both hands together and then massaged it into his beard, mustache and the skin below and around it all. I explained to him the benefits of the oils while doing so. When done he looked in the mirror and liked how it made the hairs in his beard and mustache look moisturized and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it a few times on his own he has decided its best use for him is once or twice a week depending on factors like weather, working out, etc. that might cause skin/hair changes. He likes how it moisturizes both the hair and his skin and helps keep it looking healthy. He said he would recommend it to other men who like to maintain their beards and keep them looking healthy and not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I find worth noting and think is really cute is that this bottle came in a tiny jute drawstring bag. Also this oil has a mixture of great oils that would be good for both men and women’s skin so if the wifey or girlfriend have an emergency need for moisturizer they could use this in a pinch. It could even be used to condition the hair on your head as well. The oil itself comes in a glass bottle with a dropper connected to the lid to dispense the oil like other essential oils or skin serums you might buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting the item for free this is both mine and hubbies 100% honest opinions.</li>
    <li> I got all 3 of these by Smooth Viking as a gift for my husband, he loves the Oil, Balm, and Conditioner!  Using all 3 as a combo set in this dry weather he noted that his dry skin itch is gone and his beard looks fuller and kempt.  I loved the fact that these products are organic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend buying all 3 as a gift set for the grizzly man in your life!</li>
    <li> This will make your beard so soft! And easy to manage, it also does not leave any greasy feeling in your beard. My brother in law loves using this, together with smooth Viking beard balm, and conditioner! Those three together, and he&#x27;s got a soft, manageable beard. My sister loves running her hands through it! Product received for review.</li>
    <li> The combination of this and the beard balm is absolutely amazing!  He has such a soft beard now.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my boyfriend.  He uses it daily and it has helped any dryness that he had.</li>
    <li> With having a man beard comes great responsibility and with this beard oil I can maintain this bad boy and not let it take over my face. I&#x27;m in control with this oil</li>
    <li> This oil is slightly heavier and does pretty good at controlling wild hairs. Only 3 stars today because of the scent. Where other beard oils I&#x27;ve tested have been pleasant in one way or another, this oil is abrasive smelling. My first thought was &amp;#34;machine shop.&amp;#34; Of course, smell is personal preference; maybe it is more attractive to other people.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil for my husband to try after not achieving the conditioning results he wanted with a beard balm. He is very happy with the ease of use, lack of strong smell, and wonderful conditioning. The customer service is EXCELLENT! They followed up after my purchase with an email to make sure that if we had any questions, they could be answered right away. I will definitely be purchasing from this company again.</li>
    <li> Received at discounted rate</li>
    <li> great company and a great product! Will be again and again. Noticed a difference in just a couple of days with how soft my beard was and shiny. Helped repair the split and dead ends! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> One day my son of 19 comes home in day and said he has to cut  his beard? His girlfriend says it scarves her when they kissed . I told him I have  a product for you? In a week he said it works.</li>
    <li> I bought this beard oil for my hubby who has a beard. The stuff he was using before smelled so good before it went on, but then smelled so bad after it was on. This stuff has no smell, on or off and it&#x27;s great. It adsorbs nicely so it isn&#x27;t getting all over the place. It makes his beard not so kinky and definitely smooths it out. I wish I would have bought this one before I bought the other one--I should&#x27;ve read the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like is the fact that it&#x27;s organic. It&#x27;s so hard to find healthy organic products these days ... even the ones that say they are healthy or good for the environment aren&#x27;t, but this stuff is legit.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE PACKING. MY HUSBAND LIKE THIS BREAD OIL  HE SAID WORKING SO GOOD AND HIS BREAD SOFT. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS FREE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Started using this beard oil on the days I don&#x27;t need full control like a wax for my beard (B.I.G beard balm tame the mane) that&#x27;s what I use for work days or when I go out with the girlfriend.now for this oil I use it at night after a shower or when I&#x27;m just feeling casual and the beard just needs to look healthy and soft.does this beard oil work yes it does im happy it has a small scent to it but not too bad. Beard gets very soft and seems to give a bit of control when I comb over it. Just a few drops is all you need.will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as he has been growing his beard all winter and it&#x27;s been kind of itchy.  After a couple days use, you can see and feel the difference.  The smell is very pleasant and he is not scratching it all the time.  We will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I always prefer when a beard oil uses an eye dropper to dispense the product. It allows for more control and lest waste.  This 2 oz. bottle is double the amount you&#x27;ll get with other brands. It comes in a burlap sack which I thought was a nice touch (and which my wife promptly stole for what can only be non-manly purposes.)  It made my beard shiny and helps prevent the inevitable tangles those of us with curly beards often endure. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell.  Though mild, it is not odorless. I can only describe it as an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smell. I&#x27;d probably like to try a scented version of this oil and it&#x27;s not a horrible smell.  Just takes a few minutes to get used to.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to a friend of mine who has a crazy beard.  He is always trying new beard products so I thought he&#x27;d love to try these products that I just received from Smooth Viking as well.  The info provided here is based on the feedback he gave to me.  The product does not have much of a smell like some beard oils do but that is fine.  It did a great job of moisturizing his skin and beard.  He recommends the product because it made his beard easier to control and kept it looking good.  He only used 2-3 drops after shaving and it kept his skin and beard nice and moisturized.  Sample provided for testing, evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I love that this has the dropper with it and the bottle is bigger than I thought! It softens the beard nicely and it&#x27;s all natural which is always a plus!!</li>
    <li> For some time now I have been looking for one specifically with castor oil in it as that&#x27;s something I have actually experienced growth stimulation with. This was one of the few with any in it. I&#x27;ve already used many oils including Moroccan Argan, Avocado oil, Sweet Almond, Olive oil, and Jojoba Oil so I had an inkling this would be good. Pumpkin seed oil was a new one to me. Well this oil blend ended up being so much better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It immediately sunk in, thanks in great part to being silicone free, and softened the coarse hair with out making look or feel greasy. It feels great on the skin too and has caused zero break outs making it a great duel purpose oil/balm. Even after washing the hair still feels considerably softer. Smooth Viking really knows their stuff. One drop is literally enough so I really do not use the dropper. Since the oil is very thin and clear I&#x27;m guessing Jamaican castor oil is not used in this. The scent itself is unique and smells slightly citrus. They do not say which essential oils they use but to my nose there is a hint of lime mixed with the scents of olive and Argan. If you like Bay Rum cologne you should be fine with this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, while this could last forever because of how little is needed, this is avocado oil based (first ingredient) and that oil in particular is known to be a carrier oil that goes rancid quickly. Even when refrigerated. There really aren&#x27;t any preservatives in this so I&#x27;ll be using this on my skin as well to use it up quicker. Smooth Viking provided a discount to purchase this product for review.</li>
    <li> Everything worked as Smooth Viking described it would.  The only thing I would change is the smell.  I use a leave in conditioner that smells awesome.  Since this is a beard product you can smell it all of the time and therefore due to the smell, I personally wouldn’t use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received a complimentary sample for our honest opinion.  All opinions are our own&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Worked wonders on my husband&#x27;s beard. It went from rough and unruly to tidy and soft.</li>
    <li> Hubby received this yesterday.  After one treatment his beard feels softer and more easily to manage.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend and he really loved it for his mustache! It makes the hair softer and less itchy! Great product!</li>
    <li> I received this as a review item and gave it to my husband to try. He really likes the way it makes his beard feel and it absolutely makes his beard softer and shinier. It doesn&#x27;t have a distinctive smell, which is good for those who are allergic or who simply don&#x27;t want the odor. If you want the beard oil to smell nice, you could always add some essential oil.</li>
    <li> This product is a great addition to your beard care routine.  It has Avocado oil, sweet almond oil, argon oil, olive oil, Jojoba, pumpkin seed oil,castor oil and vitamin E essential oil.  That is quite an amazing array of oils.  All which are good for you hair and skin.  it is great to a product with all ingredients that the average person can pronounce and no chemicals.  It soaks in nicely and gives a nice sheen to your beard with out making it look too oily. it also makes your beard feel very soft to the touch. It is also a pretty big bottle at 2 ounces!  If you use it as directed at only 3 drops per use this should last ya a long time.  I think this is a great product.</li>
    <li> My sweet smelling beard thanks me for buying this product. Comes in a cool package and works great. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Fast shipping. Happy with product!</li>
    <li> This oil made my beard feel so smooth and tamed. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for an all natural product. I love that it takes so little to make a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Technically I don&#x27;t love this..my husband does.  He started using it right away and within a few days he was raving about it.  His beard looks nicer and he says it feels better and is less itchy.  Even his skin around his bear looks better.  I recommend this to all beard growers.</li>
    <li> This beard oil is used sparingly to soften, reduce itch, and eiminate dandruff. All of Smooth Viking products are all natural, so you can feel good about buying and using them. Also helps strengthen beards.</li>
    <li> It relieves the itchiness from my beard, It makes my beard shiner and softens the hair so much, I was optimistic when I purchased the product but it works so good the first time you use it you can tell a difference. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s crazy winter beard was out of control, until he received this Beard Oil.  Thank goodness we stumbled upon this product! It smells great, has a nice smooth consistency, and has made a great difference in how nice and put-together his beard looks.  It&#x27;s more moisturized, and looks more kempt.  He&#x27;s been using their Beard Oil, Beard Conditioner, and Beard Balm too, and is highly pleased with their product line!</li>
    <li> After first using it, looks good.</li>
    <li> awesome for the man in your life....he will ask you to reorder.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and works well. A little bit goes a long way and my husband has been very happy with it!</li>
    <li> My husband has a full facial beard and loves this product. It is very easy to use. It makes his beard smell great and its a smell he can stand. It makes his beard super soft. Even though it is oil it doesn&#x27;t leave his beard looking oily or feeling greasy. It also doesn&#x27;t clog up his pores. I received this to review and my husband has recommended to all his friends and co workers so I definitely recommend too/</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband it&#x27;s gentle enough for even the most sensitive skin like his and it actually reduce his inflammation and improved the circulation of his skin. It gave his him a youthful healthy glow! By drawing moisture into the skin, it is in a category of it&#x27;s own, compared to lotions and creams this is by far the best!</li>
    <li> Awesome oil. Beard feels soft and manageable</li>
    <li> I got this item as a gift for my husband, but it was also a gift for me! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s What I Love about Smooth Vikings Beard Oil, Balm &amp; Conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- His beard appears more moisturized &amp; healthier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- His beard is softer, and much more lovable after 1 week of regular use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- He doesn&#x27;t scratch his beard as much as it grows out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- His beard has no more flakes of beard dandruff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The products arrive in lovely rustic burlap bags, which would be perfect for easy gift giving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I purchased a bottle on steep discount &amp; was sent one bottle for review purposes.</li>
    <li> My husbands beard is so soft and smells delish!</li>
    <li> Has a bit of a funny smell but does moisturize.</li>
    <li> So far this has been a good product. I had actually just started growing the beard again. I will tell you that this stuff has helped a lot through the early itching stage. I am a little over a week into it, the new beard so will try to get back here when its a little thicker (which is why I only gave 4/5 starts). But so far it has worked really well.</li>
    <li> I got this and the beard conditioner for my husband because I wanted to see how he looked with a beard and anyone that has grown out their facial hair knows the struggle of having an itchy face. My husband didn&#x27;t want to grow it out because of this and it took some coaxing but once he started using the 2 products. The conditioner instantly made the itching stop after application and the oil keep his beard in shape. Also love that this is made with all natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift to my brother--a Master Beard owner. With this oil, his beard, typically unruly and wiry, has become soft and tamed and it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin. His wife thanks me for introducing him to Smooth Viking beard oil! Seller is super prompt, communicative and courteous, to boot!</li>
    <li> Comes in a great looking glass bottle and packaged in a cute little burlap sack. Smell is nice, but my Bf finds this too oily, he prefers the balm. Not bad just depends on the person. I received this free for review.</li>
    <li> I got for my husband to try because he has one of those pokey breads and he used for a few days already and already noticing a difference. Can actually get close to him without the fear of being poked with a stray hair.</li>
    <li> I use this beard oil to my hair after clean my hair . After many times use, my hair became soft and smoothing, and easy to comb. I like it&#x27;s 100% natural ingredients so I can use it everyday. Love it!</li>
    <li> Smooth Viking 100% Natural Beard Oil made my husband&#x27;s beard much softer and more fun to run my fingers thru.  He says that it doesn&#x27;t itch as much when he applies the beard oil as well.  We both agree that it&#x27;s a great product, easy for him to use, and helps keep his beard more manageable.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product on his beard for a couple weeks now. His beard is on the shorter side so I wondered how well it would work and I cannot believe how soft it makes his beard!! I think I like the product more than he does!! Plus 100% natural is an awesome added benefit!! It smells nice too! Definitely Wife Approved!</li>
    <li> Beard oil is of liquid, oil like consistency. Very easy to spread and keeps beard healthy looking. It contains all these oils, that are good not only for beard but also for skin. All natural and no chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;According to my son-in-law, all three products by Viking are great and he is thankful that I got them for him.</li>
    <li> Since I bought this for my husband I can only say I&#x27;ve noticed his beard is softer and not so unruly in the morning. It stays in its shape easier.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this stuff! He&#x27;s tried for years to grow out his beard, but always gets frustrated with how itchy it gets and shaves it off. He uses about 3 drops a day of this beard oil and has loved the results. He doesn&#x27;t get dandruff, he doesn&#x27;t have itching, this keeps it very soft. Excellent quality product. Will definitely be buying again. And again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I bought for my man, as his winter beard gets scratchy and itches both of us.  A little of this oil, and his beard is smooth, and looks like it was just manicured at the salon (don&#x27;t tell him I said that....he is not a &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; type of guy).  I also tried it on my hair- like reqular argan oil, and it worked just the same.  I then tried it in the bath, and it helped my skin too.  As you can see, I&#x27;m finding lots of smooth uses for this product!  The smell is okay, and after a few seconds dissipates, so no issues there.  Don&#x27;t let the size fool you, a little goes a long way.....  It also comes nicely packaged in a burlap gift bag, which has my thinking of buying more for guy friends with facial hair as gifts.  Thank you Smooth Viking!</li>
    <li> Lovely texture, made my beard feel really soft -- however, I find the scent to be a bit too strong that close to my nose. Since no scent type was actually listed, I was hoping it was &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s too woody/musky for my tastes.</li>
    <li> The Beard Oil has a nice citrus scent to it that is pleasing, but not overpowering.  It softens your facial hair and I like it.  Definitely not as thick or oily as a shave oil though, but the serve different purposes also.</li>
    <li> So smooth And soft. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Makes your beard feel soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> FELT THE DIFFERENCE IN MY BEARD INSTANTLY. EASY TO APPLY . BEARD FEELS SOFTER</li>
    <li> Made my hubbies beard so soft.  Calmed the wayward ones.</li>
    <li> I gave this item to a friend and he says that his beard is nice and soft since he has been using this.</li>
    <li> Hah! This made the husband&#x27;s beard less itchy and scratchy. I hate it when he kiss me and his beards feel so itchy. This one made it less those I mentioned. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s helped the itching and flaking go away. My husbands beard is a lot smoother. He does have to use more of it because his beard is longer. He would really like to try the balm that&#x27;s recommended to go with it. He will keep using this for a while as it does seem to help a lot.</li>
    <li> As expected. Works great and hubby loves it.</li>
    <li> My soon to be 84 year old father is a dapper guy and very particular about his appearance, his beard, and trying new products.  We approached this venture together starting with the wonderful blend of oils that are really excellent.  His beard can be a little course, so he decided on four drops, starting at the chin and massaging up and out.  For his medium, semi-coarse beard, four drops is too much.  A little goes a long way making it very price effective.  So, after some trial and error, two drops a day is just right.  He loves it.  It&#x27;s natural ingredients produce no sensitivity on his sensitive skin, and he&#x27;s feeling great about this experiment.  Dapper Dad loves this 100% Natural Beard Oil!</li>
    <li> This product is full of great oils! I must confess I bought it as an after shampoo leave in for my hair! And I love it! Just a few drops on the ends and my hair feels wonderful</li>
    <li> This oil contains ingredients suitable for all hair not just beard hair. I am a woman and have used a few drops to condition and soften my hair. This stuff works great.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and uses it every day!!! He was so excited when I snagged this deal for him!! Thank you</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells wonderful. Made dads skin and bread softer and nicer. Did not irriate his skin nor me as i was the one who applied it and i have chemical allergies.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and he can&#x27;t stop using it!  It smells wonderful and makes his beard very soft.  It comes in this really cool burlap drawstring bag and makes a wonderful gift for anyone.  One of my friends used some in her hair and it made it very silky. We will be buying this again!  Shipped quickly and packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> My husband tried this as part of the 3 piece set of oil, balm and conditioner. His beard tends to be rough and he has problems with itchiness and flaking. Since using this, his beard is much, much softer and the itchiness is almost gone. It takes a few tries to get the knack of applying just a few drops, but if you use too much just rub with a towel. A must item for a well-groomed beard!</li>
    <li> Does what it says will do. Makes the beard look shiny and healthy. I don&#x27;t have a huge beard but I needed more than  &amp;#34;three drops&amp;#34; to work through all of my beard.</li>
    <li> Softens the beard hair and helps stop the itch under the beard. Made his beard soft and shiny. My husband didn&#x27;t like the smell of the oil but I didn&#x27;t think it smelled bad at all. I think it&#x27;s a great oil when combined with the other Smooth Viking beard items. In combination, this set will ensure a healthy, smooth, shiny, and tame beard the ladies will love. *received at a promotional price for testing and review*</li>
    <li> My brother tried this out (it was a gift for him) and he is very happy with it but it isn&#x27;t his favorite.  He liked the balm and conditioner much better.  That is probably a personal preference of texture though.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using such an item. So far, only good results!</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the texture and look of my Husbands beard after only using this 3 days! It&#x27;s shinier, softer and no out of place hairs that looked snarled or unkempt! I didn&#x27;t even know beard oil existed and now I can&#x27;t tell you enough how Fabulous it is and can change your mans whole look! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Helps my husband so much!</li>
