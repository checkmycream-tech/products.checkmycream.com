      <li>The smell was not like the original...</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and</li>
      <li>my first review gave it 2 stars, but because it does develop into a pleasant scent after a short while, i added a star.</li>
      <li>My favorite perfume (Enjoli by Revlon) has been discontinued and this is the only reasonably-priced scent I can find that is somewhat close.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s short-lasting, but it&#x27;s not expensive.  </li>
      <li>at first when you spray it, it has an unpleasant note, but this note disappears and the scent does develop nicely, not into the wonderful original intimate scent, but nice.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much for finding it for me.</li>
      <li>this newer version (the second version of intimate) does have a hint of the original scent.  </li>
      <li>this definitely is not the original scent.  </li>
      <li>I have used this perfume since high school in the 60&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have the exact same fragrance as before.  </li>
      <li>Thought I&#x27;d have to try something new, but it&#x27;s hard to change after so many years.  </li>
      <li>It is a most becoming scent...not too heavy and very subtle.</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s getting difficult to find Intimate, too, so when I saw it on Amazon for a terrific price, I was thrilled.  </li>
      <li>thank you so very much for this and all the other items I have purchased here.</li>

    <li> Thought I&#x27;d have to try something new, but it&#x27;s hard to change after so many years.  Love the Intimate fragrance and nice to know it&#x27;s still available.  Amazon.com is the best place to find what you need.  The package arrived quickly and in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> I adore the perfume, but the fragrance seems diluted and doesn&#x27;t last very long. It seldom lasts more than an hour.</li>

    <li> Bought this perfume for Mother&#x27;s Day. It&#x27;s not as I remembered it from 35 years ago. Has a different scent. It&#x27;s ok, but not the stuff that drove me crazy when my wife wore it.</li>
    <li> She uses this perfume a lot time. She will more of this again soon..The price was also great too..Being able to recieve in a vew also helped...</li>

    <li> I have ordered this perfume before but it appears they have changed it a bit and it doesn&#x27;t have the exact same fragrance as before.  I like it but I liked the older formula better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume since high school in the 60&#x27;s.  I loved it then and Iove it now.  I hope they never discontinue it.  I only wear two perfumes and this is one of them.  Thank you so much for finding it for me.</li>
