      <li>Pretty much the best face wash</li>
      <li>Smells very earthy and pleasant.</li>
      <li>It has a very strong scent but is not unpleasant at all.  </li>
      <li>Other than that it is the perfect face bar for me.  </li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling clean, refreshed and smooth!</li>
      <li>Smells good, feels good, lasts long time, clean ingredients.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t market this as shave soap for men - it is fantastic with a badger-hair</li>
      <li>This soap makes my 40 something skin feel clean without over drying.</li>
      <li>first the scent seemed strong to me</li>
      <li>SO fresh and clean smelling-</li>
      <li>First, let me say that I really love Arcona&#x27;s Gentle Solution PM Repair, so I was hopeful when I ordered this soap.  </li>
      <li>I can not always afford to get arcona, but when I can it is worth it.</li>
      <li>find this bar to be pretty mild on my skin where it does not have any adverse effects ( no sensitivity, bumps, residue etc).</li>
      <li>I have used this toner tea bar for years and love the smell and fact that it does not dry my skin out.</li>
      <li>this is my third time ordering this tea bar :)</li>
      <li>Gives me clean, clear skin!</li>
      <li>but it will clear your skin, CLEAN your skin; it has green/black tea....</li>
      <li>I really like the smell</li>
      <li>It lasts much longer than liquid cleanser.</li>
      <li>If the price was lower it wouldn&#x27;t bother me as much.  </li>
      <li>I love Arcona products but prefer some of their other products over this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>this soap has kept my skin and teenage daughters skin clear and clean</li>
      <li>I really had high hopes for this product, but it seems to have a different effect for people.</li>
      <li>This left my skin feeling very clean, cleaner than I can remember any other cleanser making it feel.  </li>
      <li>I use this along with their Solution, and the combination keeps my skin looking great without all the harsh and synthetic garbage chemicals you see in other brands, YES it&#x27;s pricey but isn&#x27;t your face, which people look at everyday, worth it?</li>
      <li>smell is a little medicinal, which is fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>I have always had sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, this bar keeps my skin clear without any irritation!</li>
      <li>I was referred to this product by the dermatology spa I frequently visit.</li>
      <li>It lasts me about 7-8 months; simply because, I don&#x27;t use it every day;  it can dry- your skin a bit much if you &#x27;d use it daily.  </li>
      <li>it is very drying and leaves my skin feeling tight  </li>

The price here is a couple dollars better than at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this bar to be pretty mild on my skin where it does not have any adverse effects ( no sensitivity, bumps, residue etc). Pretty much the best face wash I&#x27;ve had in my 31 years. A little on the pricey side but it also lasts too.</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels good, lasts long time, clean ingredients. this is my third time ordering this tea bar :)</li>
    <li> I have used only Erno Lazlo for 30 years...  Then saw this and decided to try it...  It is wonderful!  Shrinks pores and thoroughly cleans without drying...  Only problem is the shape...  Does not fit soap dishes...  I wash my face in the shower each morning and don&#x27;t want to take a glass jar into the shower...  Wish jar was plastic or soap was rectangular...</li>
    <li> This soap was recommended for me at a spa &amp; I thought it was ust the usual up-sell product. I could not have been more wrong. This soap makes my 40 something skin feel clean without over drying. I love it!</li>
    <li> I totally disagree with another reviewer about the smell -- I guess it&#x27;s a personal thing.  I really like the smell, it smells like a spicy orange to me.  I got a free sample of this product and really liked how it cleaned as well.  I have an oily T-zone and aging skin overall.  This left my skin feeling very clean, cleaner than I can remember any other cleanser making it feel.  But it doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all.  I plan to buy it now that my sample is used up.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite Arcona Products. SO fresh and clean smelling- Leaves skin feeling clean, refreshed and smooth!</li>
    <li> absolutely love it!  My skin has never looked or felt better.&lt;br /&gt;At first the scent seemed strong to me and now I just love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I use to get a lot of breakouts but ever since switching from acne facial soap to toner tea bar, my skin has not been prone to breakouts. Along with that, it smells great and is easy to use twice a day.</li>
    <li> I could not live without Arcona Toner Tea Bar!!!</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser a lot.  THe down side is the price.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I can not always afford to get arcona, but when I can it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Great bar. Smells very earthy and pleasant. I love all arcona products.</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this product, but it seems to have a different effect for people. Even though I gave it some time so my skin would adjust, it never did...I just kept breaking out. Won&#x27;t be using this anymore. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This soap works pretty well, but the smell is terrible!  I love Arcona products but prefer some of their other products over this cleanser.  I love the Raspberry acne bar cleaner!!!!</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I really love Arcona&#x27;s Gentle Solution PM Repair, so I was hopeful when I ordered this soap.  Here are the things I dislike about it:  * it smells medicinal  * it is very drying and leaves my skin feeling tight  * it has all the downsides of a bar -- wet storage, some gelatinous consistency, sticks to the container.</li>
    <li> Love this face bar. Have been using it for a year. My only complaint is how expensive it is. However it does last about 5 months.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t market this as shave soap for men - it is fantastic with a badger-hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little medicinal, which is fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the lid - funny how hard it sometimes is to get back on.</li>
    <li> Have used this for over a year and love it. Gives me clean, clear skin!</li>
    <li> Besides having an effer-vescent great scent- this soap( hate to call it a soap..but it will clear your skin, CLEAN your skin; it has green/black tea.... helps remove blackheads...acne.... it is so great, I&#x27;ve used it for 7 years now.  It lasts me about 7-8 months; simply because, I don&#x27;t use it every day;  it can dry- your skin a bit much if you &#x27;d use it daily.  I use it more in summer, when perspireing,,( oily face;  Will clean wonderfully.  I will always have it stocked in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I have used this toner tea bar for years and love the smell and fact that it does not dry my skin out. It lasts much longer than liquid cleanser. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is amazing!!  It has a very strong scent but is not unpleasant at all.  My face feels amazing after washing with this.  The only con I can think of is that after a while the bar starts to break down and turns soft.  It&#x27;s still usable but just breaks down towards the end.  However, I love it and have bought many bars and will continue to use it and recommend it to everyone.</li>
