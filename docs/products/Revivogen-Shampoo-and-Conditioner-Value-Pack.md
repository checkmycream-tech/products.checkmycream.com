      <li>Good shampoo, but won&#x27;t regrow it.</li>
      <li>At the end of every shower my head looked good, but give or take an hour</li>
      <li>works good but a bit on the spendy side.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think this product is working for me.</li>
      <li>This shampoo make my hair fell nice</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and clean.</li>
      <li>I bought this early from the Revivogen official site , everything was perfect.</li>
      <li>its an okay shampoo.</li>
      <li>and I have already started seeing much better results.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s not this making my hair fall more.</li>
      <li>more you use it the better your hair feels.</li>
      <li>My hair is looking so much better after almost 2 months of use.</li>
      <li>I love the conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My husband prefers this product over Rogaine mostly because of price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
      <li>I really do love this product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;re-grow\\&quot; hair and don&#x27;t expect any miracles, but it will leave your scalp feeling very healthy and clean and the remaining hair that you do have will feel more full</li>
      <li>I purchased these two times as I noticed some significant thinning on the top.</li>
      <li>Worth the investment :)</li>
      <li>If you are looking for cheap shampoos or break your wallet cost shampoos just google sulfate-free shampoo list.</li>
      <li>I generally buy salon products which are good quality.  </li>
      <li>But he&#x27;s pretty fussy about his hair, so it must work OK for him.</li>
      <li>I cannot deny the power the shampoo has to clean the head.  </li>
      <li>Hair feels clean and looks thicker and healthier after use.</li>
      <li>At the end of each shower my head felt clean, and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I like the smell, the rich lather and the tingling cool after using these two together.</li>
      <li>If your scalp starts to dry out, STOP using the product, regardless of their advice - their goal is just to sell you more product!!  </li>
      <li>but it certainly makes my scalp feel better and thickens my hair..</li>
      <li>It makes your head tingle and feels pretty minty, but to be honest for the price and the changes (I didn&#x27;t really notice any...)</li>
      <li>Since she&#x27;s been using Revivogen shampoo and conditioner her hair is full, shiny</li>
      <li>But nothing I have tried is better for my particular hair issues.  </li>
      <li>It has a minty smell and it made my scalp feel fresh and cool.</li>
      <li>, im only on my first month but will give it more time to show better result...</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
      <li>Do research first!</li>
      <li>To make it better the conditioner, however light, does nothing to bring any strength or softness back.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like shelling out the money to buy the shampoo, but I can now say it was well worth my money.</li>
      <li>good thing about this is it makes my head less itchy.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d have better luck looking at some proven routines such as fish oil capsuls, biotin, Nizoral regimen, and rogaine.</li>
      <li>now i use only this shampoo all the time. :)</li>
      <li>At first it seems like it stopped the hair loss then shedding starts and never stops.</li>
      <li>With Revivogen, 5% Rogain Foam, 1mg daily of Finasteride and Aveda Grooming Clay (for daily styling) I have finally found the perfect combination in fighting hair loss.</li>
      <li>Use it for first time and waiting for results.</li>
      <li>Works much better and smells much better than WEN and OVATION on my grey, naturally curly, fine hair that I wash daily.</li>
      <li>You feel nice and fresh after shower but it looks like the hair is dried out.</li>
      <li>It has a little bit of a minty smell that is quite nice.</li>
      <li>it just gives the illusion that your hair is thicker, doesnt really help with anything.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference and am now trying another shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>it made me lose so much hair</li>
      <li>If you really believe the hype on Saw Palmetto (one of the ingredients that suppose to inhibit DHT that causes hair loss), you are fooling yourself to think your head will absorb it.  </li>
      <li>Even though It did not do  much  to  grow  my  hair, I  use  it for the shine  and  beauty that give  the hair.  </li>
      <li>maybe i wouldn&#x27;t have lost that much hair every time i used it</li>
      <li>It really hps thicken my hair.</li>
      <li>and I really like the results that I&#x27;m getting.</li>
      <li>Just didn&#x27;t work for me and cost me so much money.</li>
      <li>My hair is more sparse than ever, with a very visible wide part.  </li>
      <li>and after i use it in my hair don&#x27;t break so easy like before and is looking more strong, but if you stop use it like i do for two weeks only my hair was again thin ,so</li>
      <li>I emailed them and described the problem, and was told to wash every other day with a tar shampoo, but to be sure to continue to use the Revivogen.  </li>
      <li>Try Creme of Nature with argon oil shampoo, it is half the cost of this shampoo and in my opinion 10x better.  </li>
      <li>The reality is for us guys growing bald, we need products that contain sulfates-free ingredients (no Sodium Lauryl Sulfate SLS,  Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate ALS, etc...), as this is the main culprit that assist with speeding up the process of our hairs falling out because of its harshness as a cleaning agent.  </li>
      <li>but you must follow a steady regiment on how to use it.</li>
      <li>I have used Clearogen (by the same company) in the past and loved it.</li>
      <li>just read that drying out and stripping all the oils makes your head appear thicker because dry, coarse hair looks thicker but at the cost of weakening your hair and making it more prone to falling out.  </li>
      <li>I bought a 6 month supply of this, after 4 months I chucked it and tried something new.  </li>
      <li>Although this product does not create new hair growth I will say it stops the hair loss cycle.</li>
      <li>So, when I seemed to be losing more hair than usual, I ordered Revivogen.  </li>
      <li>So it looks thicker but not sure if healthy.</li>
      <li>Having a Father and two older brothers that went completely bald by the age of 20, I was conscious about my hair from a very young age.</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight hair that is color treated (foils / bleach) that I keep cut short because it has so little body.  </li>
      <li>I even use Rogaine on my temples and frontal hair line and it&#x27;s always worked very well for me (initial shedding phase takes patience, don&#x27;t give up!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is totally unexpected.</li>
      <li>My hair is thicker and has grown considerably longer, faster, since using it.</li>
      <li>Compared to my old shampoo (head and shoulders), hair still falls out but not that many.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Conditioner was like applying oil directly to my scalp.</li>
      <li>AND I WOULD NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
      <li>From time to time I try to use up my old shampoo, but I always remember why I switched.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see a difference other then a little more strands of hair coming out.</li>
      <li>others have mentioned, this product does dry out he scalp a little bit, so be sure to use Nizoral once or twice a week to fight dandruff</li>
      <li>&quot; (new growth) whenever I pull my hair back.</li>
      <li>On top of that now you have a super dry scalp (now flakes can start to kick in), dry hair (weak, brittle, breakable), and you have a recipe for disaster.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The ideal shampoo for me I used it years ago it  was more than wonderful, the speed of hair growth</li>
    <li> dont know if this grows hair yet.. but it certainly makes my scalp feel better and thickens my hair..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 month now and I really like the results that I&#x27;m getting. Prior to using this product my hair felt thin and frail. It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;re-grow\\&quot; hair and don&#x27;t expect any miracles, but it will leave your scalp feeling very healthy and clean and the remaining hair that you do have will feel more full and I believe it has slowed down the amount of hair I lose naturally on a day to day basis. Great product and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner as a precaution. I am only 29 and female baldness is a problem to the women in my family. My hair began to thin tremendously over the past 3 years. I was seeking something to help stop/slow the process. I didn&#x27;t like shelling out the money to buy the shampoo, but I can now say it was well worth my money. I&#x27;ve been using it for approx 6 months and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not falling out in the volume it once was and I noticed that I have a lot of \\&quot;fly aways\\&quot; (new growth) whenever I pull my hair back. My hair is thicker and has grown considerably longer, faster, since using it. I&#x27;m elated with my results and look forward to seeing what a year or two with continual use will do for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both shampoo and conditioner have a mint smell. On a bit of a side note I&#x27;ve used over the counter Nizoral (for dandruff prevention) for years and still do once a week, along with Revivogen the rest of the week. I have nothing but good from their use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to family members &amp; will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is totally unexpected. I bought this early from the Revivogen official site , everything was perfect. But this time product is horrible , looks like old items...smell horrible.</li>
    <li> This shampoo make my hair fell nice and after i use it in my hair don&#x27;t break so easy like before and is looking more strong, but if you stop use it like i do for two weeks only my hair was again thin ,so now i use only this shampoo all the time. :)</li>
    <li> I bought a 6 month supply of this, after 4 months I chucked it and tried something new.  It stained my fingers including under my nails not to mention it smelled horrible.  Also - my hair loss became worst after using this - I think I would have been better off to not even have used this product. I bought the six month kit from onlyhairloss.com.  Once I chucked this product I tried another which was better but still not great.  I have been using Bosley for about a month now and I have already started seeing much better results.  THIS PROUDUCT SUCKS AND I WOULD NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough (only a few weeks) to see if it works. It feels good  and smells good.</li>
    <li> I really do love this product.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, but won&#x27;t regrow it.</li>
    <li> Got this product for my husband not only is his hair growing back but also thicker. Also it smells great too.</li>
    <li> it made me lose so much hair and i would never go back to using it.. Hate it!! Im a male 20 and i wish i never tried this cause maybe i wouldn&#x27;t have lost that much hair every time i used it</li>
    <li> I purchased these two times as I noticed some significant thinning on the top. It makes your head tingle and feels pretty minty, but to be honest for the price and the changes (I didn&#x27;t really notice any...) I would not purchase this product. You&#x27;d have better luck looking at some proven routines such as fish oil capsuls, biotin, Nizoral regimen, and rogaine.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t think this product is working for me. I bought the shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month. After I applied shampoo and then rinse, I would see a lot of hair on the sink. Its roughly about 30-40 of them (I&#x27;m not exaggerating). Compared to my old shampoo (head and shoulders), hair still falls out but not that many.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this is it makes my head less itchy. And it does seem like my hair is getting slightly darker. Maybe some of my hair are thickening......or maybe this is a hair dye product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this to see if I will lose less hair in the long-run. Once I&#x27;m done with the bottle, I&#x27;ll purchase the scalp therapy and give that a try.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have used.  I have been using it for 2 years, hair is filling in not thinning out.</li>
    <li> Works much better and smells much better than WEN and OVATION on my grey, naturally curly, fine hair that I wash daily.</li>
    <li> Although this product does not create new hair growth I will say it stops the hair loss cycle. I have been using it for over a year and I have noticed my hair loss has leveled off.</li>
    <li> works good but a bit on the spendy side.</li>
    <li> No new hair but my hair doesn&#x27;t appear to have thinned at all in the past 4 years or so since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> Revivogen was actually recommended to me by my dermatologist, after I was diagnosed with androgenetic alpocia (female pattern baldness). My hair is looking so much better after almost 2 months of use. I can&#x27;t say if it just the shampoo and conditioner that is helping, as I am taking vitamins and using Rogaine as well,  but I did start noticing improvement after I started using it. Hair feels clean and looks thicker and healthier after use.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see a difference other then a little more strands of hair coming out. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s not this making my hair fall more. The smell is pleasant and clean. It has a minty smell and it made my scalp feel fresh and cool.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product !!! Worth the investment :)</li>
    <li> this product worked well for me and I keep using it, im only on my first month but will give it more time to show better result...</li>
    <li> Use it for first time and waiting for results. Lets see whats next. Buy it!!! and see if its works on you.</li>
    <li> My husband prefers this product over Rogaine mostly because of price.  But he&#x27;s pretty fussy about his hair, so it must work OK for him.</li>
    <li> I cannot deny the power the shampoo has to clean the head.  It literally strips your hair and scalp of all of its natural oils and leaves it dry and brittle. To make it better the conditioner, however light, does nothing to bring any strength or softness back. At the end of each shower my head felt clean, and refreshed. My hair deceptively looked thicker despite watching a ton of hair wash away each time I used this product.  At the end of every shower my head looked good, but give or take an hour and it started looking bad or worse as if it accelerated hair loss, I looked more bald than before my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just read that drying out and stripping all the oils makes your head appear thicker because dry, coarse hair looks thicker but at the cost of weakening your hair and making it more prone to falling out.  On top of that now you have a super dry scalp (now flakes can start to kick in), dry hair (weak, brittle, breakable), and you have a recipe for disaster.  There is a reason no hair stylist, magazine, or this reviewer will ever recommend this product to anyone.  If you really believe the hype on Saw Palmetto (one of the ingredients that suppose to inhibit DHT that causes hair loss), you are fooling yourself to think your head will absorb it.  Just buy some saw palmetto pills and take it daily. It is waay cheaper and at least your working from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and look for another product.  Since I stopped using this product and went to cheaper products (Now using Creme of Nature with argon oil shampoo and Pantene Pro-V conditioner), my hair is softer, healthier looking throughout the day.  The reality is for us guys growing bald, we need products that contain sulfates-free ingredients (no Sodium Lauryl Sulfate SLS,  Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate ALS, etc...), as this is the main culprit that assist with speeding up the process of our hairs falling out because of its harshness as a cleaning agent.  Try Creme of Nature with argon oil shampoo, it is half the cost of this shampoo and in my opinion 10x better.  If you are looking for cheap shampoos or break your wallet cost shampoos just google sulfate-free shampoo list.</li>
    <li> I love the conditioner. It really hps thicken my hair.</li>
    <li> Mixed emotions. You feel nice and fresh after shower but it looks like the hair is dried out. So it looks thicker but not sure if healthy. Definitely good for peeps with dandruff but I feel it lacks nutrition. So now I use dandruff shampoo combined with an alternate moisturizing shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great deal, my hair looks and feels thicker.</li>
    <li> The bet yet! Thank you so much. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t go back to traditional shampoo&#x27;s or conditioners after trying this brand.&lt;br /&gt;The more you use it the better your hair feels.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t finish the bottle. Shampoo made my hair feel stripped. Conditioner was like applying oil directly to my scalp. Would never recommend.</li>
    <li> Having a Father and two older brothers that went completely bald by the age of 20, I was conscious about my hair from a very young age. Over the years I have literally tried just about every shampoo, conditioner, styling product and supplement on the market. With Revivogen, 5% Rogain Foam, 1mg daily of Finasteride and Aveda Grooming Clay (for daily styling) I have finally found the perfect combination in fighting hair loss. At age 35, my hair is finally back to being just as thick as when I was 16 (full head of hair). I even use Rogaine on my temples and frontal hair line and it&#x27;s always worked very well for me (initial shedding phase takes patience, don&#x27;t give up!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, this product does dry out he scalp a little bit, so be sure to use Nizoral once or twice a week to fight dandruff (it&#x27;s also good for battling hair loss). My Wife tends to have thinning hair in her upper scalp region and it gets really bad when she uses store brands (diluted garbage and is sure to contribute to hair loss). Since she&#x27;s been using Revivogen shampoo and conditioner her hair is full, shiny and you can&#x27;t see through to her scalp even in the sunlight like before. We are Revivogen users for life and will never switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Great product but you must follow a steady regiment on how to use it. Do research first!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, the rich lather and the tingling cool after using these two together. My hair feels thicker and my scalp seems to like the stimulation.</li>
    <li> Bad product didn&#x27;t do anything for me except for help lose more hair. At first it seems like it stopped the hair loss then shedding starts and never stops. I used it for 14 months with no results.</li>
    <li> the value pack was awesome. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this separately and would recommend to anyone else who is looking for a great product.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work me at all!!! I wish I had never bought such an expensive and useless shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have used Clearogen (by the same company) in the past and loved it. It got rid of my acne.  So, when I seemed to be losing more hair than usual, I ordered Revivogen.  Within a few weeks after starting it my scalp was itching and burning with pimples.  I emailed them and described the problem, and was told to wash every other day with a tar shampoo, but to be sure to continue to use the Revivogen.  After a few more weeks it was worse and I emailed them again.  They again encouraged me to continue to use the product.  So after 3 months the pain and itchiness was unbearable and I stopped using it.  Six months later, I&#x27;m still dealing with it, having gone to a dermatologist and had a biopsy done.  It came back with \\&quot;a layer of crust over folliculitis\\&quot;.  Apparently my scalp was so dry and compromised that follicular infection moved in. WARNING - If your scalp starts to dry out, STOP using the product, regardless of their advice - their goal is just to sell you more product!!  My hair is more sparse than ever, with a very visible wide part.  The product did not even slow down the loss while I was using it - if anything, it increased.  My scalp issues I&#x27;m sure have made the shedding worse on top of that.  I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on everything from mild and natural shampoos to moisturizing shampoos, medicated shampoos, aloe shampoos, aloe gel, prescription lotions, etc. - trying anything that might help to heal it up.  One prescription lotion costs $180 a bottle.  I research this problem incessantly on the web trying to figure out how to just get it to heal up.  Not to mention practically losing my mind trying not to scratch - my scalp itches 24 hours a day.  I also must mention that I had never before had any sort of scalp itching, scalp pimples, or dandruff before using this product.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair that is color treated (foils / bleach) that I keep cut short because it has so little body.  This is the only shampoo and conditioner I use now.  Gives my hair body, and reduces the oiliness without drying.  It&#x27;s a little bit pricey, but you don&#x27;t have to use much.  From time to time I try to use up my old shampoo, but I always remember why I switched.  I generally buy salon products which are good quality.  But nothing I have tried is better for my particular hair issues.  It has a little bit of a minty smell that is quite nice.</li>
    <li> This hair product did nothing for my hair except to make it fly away.  Just didn&#x27;t work for me and cost me so much money.</li>
    <li> Even though It did not do  much  to  grow  my  hair, I  use  it for the shine  and  beauty that give  the hair.  I  use it  everytime a  wash  my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this product for almost two months- I have long hair.  The only thing it did was completely dry out my hair.  My stylist commented on how dry it was... bought it off of a website that is obviously subsidized by these products.  Try Rogaine instead.</li>
    <li> Combined with Biotin pills, Nizoral , Rogaine and Bosley hair gel, i have notice regrowth on my hairline and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know which of these products specifically or what combination is what&#x27;s helping me get my hair back, but I am not willing to risk cutting any one of them and losing all the progress made so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going on month 2 of this process and already seeing great results.</li>
    <li> Been using the products for about a month now and my hair looks thicker and is shedding less.  This is a Great product!!</li>
    <li> its an okay shampoo. it just gives the illusion that your hair is thicker, doesnt really help with anything. i wont buy it again because its no use, if you dont use it for two days your hair is back the way it was. don&#x27;t buy it if your hoping this would cure your hair loss or whatever.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference and am now trying another shampoo.  We&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
