      <li>While Propecia is definitely most effective, I got side effects with it</li>
      <li>and I use the liquid at night because I believe the liquid may be slightly more effective.</li>

      <li>My hair is Ok</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t been able to tell if there is any regrowth there yet.</li>
      <li>But I got this shampoo mostly for the hope that it may help with hair loss.  </li>
      <li>Recommended it to my sister and we both love this.</li>
      <li>, I bought this like a gift to my scalp and hair :)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t review many products.  </li>
      <li>If anything it made my hair fall out more than before.</li>
      <li>makes your hair more course.  </li>
      <li>Very pleasant overall odor.  </li>
      <li>As a shampoo it does a fine job of cleaning your hair and scalp.  </li>
      <li>If you are in the advanced stages of hair loss, don&#x27;t expect this stuff to give you Bieber</li>
      <li>so far so good.  </li>
      <li>Alpecin is a good shampoo in general and in my opinion works.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t expect temple regrowth, but I would recommend it for some crown regrowth and a significant slowing of temple loss.</li>
      <li>After 1 month I have significant growth throughout the balding area.</li>
      <li>After first wash I really feel my hair stronger and more healthy, also This shampoo smells so cool...</li>
      <li>im using this shampoo and its good for daily use.</li>
      <li>It really did not do the magic it was supposed to do.</li>
      <li>As far for how effective it is, the jury is still out.  </li>
      <li>..MAKES MY HAIR FULL</li>
      <li>MAKES MY HAIR FULL</li>
      <li>As a supplement to my rogain, I think this shampoo is good, especially at the price point</li>
      <li>Now at about the 2 month mark, I still shed about 40 or 50 hairs in the shower, but I seem to shed about 20 more hairs for the entire rest of the day, whereas before I would shed 50 hairs in the shower, and then probably another 100 or more throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I was hoping that I&#x27;d get lucky.</li>
      <li>just started using this product works well and smells good lets see how it preforms long term.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t get side effects with it, then Propecia could very likely save you for at least 10 years and is your best bet if you need more than just to hold where you are but need significant regrowth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been losing my hair for close to a decade, and started using Rogain foam about 2 years with success.  </li>
      <li>worth to try</li>
      <li>worth to try.</li>
      <li>well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>So right now I am using Rogaine foam in the morning and liquid at night</li>
      <li>My hair has shed less, and I am more than satisfied with this as a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>At first I could feel my scalp tingle after 2 minutes of it soaking in, but after first month, I don&#x27;t feel anything anymore, undecided if it will help in hair loss, but seems to be a great addition to the dual action shampoo that I use every other day for dandruff.</li>
      <li>But 4 months later I have to say I am still completely satisfied with this shampoo.</li>
      <li>No, but it seems logical, and it works for me.    </li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t used anything else, and my shedding was consistent for a year</li>
      <li>mostly I apply it on my hairline and brush it back with my fingers even though it is not directed for the hairline.</li>
      <li>Again, it is hard to say which product has worked best for me, because I wasn&#x27;t willing to lose hair to experiment with only using one.     </li>
      <li>not sure about increase, but this does keep from your hair falling (or atleast reduces it) did get rid of all the dandruff and smells good too</li>
      <li>Can I say absolutely that the decrease in shedding is the shampoo?  </li>
      <li>but again, I can assure you my scalp is much thicker than before.</li>
      <li>I really notice a difference in volume and notice a bit of regrowth in the front of my hairline after 6 weeks of 3/wk use.</li>
      <li>I just hope this product was available from Walmart for the same price.</li>
      <li>I use the foam because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy for the whole day</li>
      <li>So I really don&#x27;t know if I am going to start Propecia yet.  </li>
      <li>In that respect, I have been using the shampoo about 2 months, so it is difficult for me to honestly say with 100% certainty that it has helped, but I feel confident that it has.  </li>
      <li>I will get the suds from the shampoo and compress it with my hands onto my scalp and then massage, then I will slowly add a little water to my hands to make the shampoo more watery and hopefully more easy to penetrate the hair follicle.  </li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend it to anybody that wants to get rid of dandruff and hair loos.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Because I can foresee people putting this on their hands, giving their hands a quick run through their hair and washing it out, and personally I don&#x27;t see this helping that much.  </li>
      <li>Just be warned that I would bet side effects are far more likely than the studies suggest, and not all of them completely go away after you stop.</li>
      <li>tried many other shampoos and this one is only right to me.</li>
      <li>So if you don&#x27;t want to go on Propecia or had side effects, I highly recommend the combination of Rogaine and these two shampoos.</li>
      <li>I normally have to use conditioner, but I don&#x27;t have to with this shampoo.    </li>
      <li>I would say I saw some regrowth on my crown, and my hairline has been for the most part holding with possibly a very slight recession.</li>
      <li>My recommendation would be to get Nizoral shampoo and use it once a week, 2 at most, and then use this shampoo 3 times a week, and then regular shampoo the other 2 days.</li>
      <li>The hair on my hairline has receded slightly, but I have a mole that makes it fairly easy to measure, and in the last 4 years, it hasn&#x27;t receded much.</li>
      <li>I say try it, if you don&#x27;t feel it is helping by the end of the first bottle, then don&#x27;t get it again, because I think by the end of the first bottle you should notice less hairloss</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, after using this product daily for a month, I&#x27;m fairly certain it does STOP hair shedding while simultaneously thickening existing hairs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I am a 22 year old man using this product for your clarification.</li>
      <li>I only review something if my satisfaction with it really stands out.</li>
      <li>no complaints so far.</li>
      <li>I had lost nearly 80% of the hair in the \\&quot;horseshoe\\&quot; of my head and tried this shampoo when we were at a friends house in Europe.....</li>
      <li>(i.e., you can get the same product elsewhere for much cheaper)</li>
      <li>If you are in the early stages of hair thinning, I challenge you to give this product a try.</li>
      <li>it completely stop hair loss.  </li>
      <li>I can tell you is that I have tried many other shampoos, that haven&#x27;t done anything, and that have also been 2 to 3 times more expensive then this.  </li>
      <li>It is a little more pricey than your average shampoo, considering it is not sold in the U.S.; however, it is reasonably priced and cheaper than Rogaine with no side effects.</li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced compared to other Caffeine Shampoos that are being sold in the US.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a superb Caffeine Shampoo.  Very reasonably priced compared to other Caffeine Shampoos that are being sold in the US.  I can smell the caffeine in it.  Very pleasant overall odor.  Good viscosity.  It&#x27;s made in Germany, so I can be confident it doesn&#x27;t have any questionable ingredients, since the European Union has the world&#x27;s strictest standards on food and drug safety (they don&#x27;t allow GMO foods there at all, but GMO&#x27;s are widely distributed in the US and don&#x27;t even have to be labeled as such).  It definitely stimulates hair growth.  I usually wash my hair using a regular type of shampoo first and then use this caffeine shampoo on the second application.  I let it sit for at least 2 minutes; longer if possible.  Then simply rinse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  It will not work on dead hair follicles (ie. areas that have been bald for a very long time.)  But if the follicles are still functional, this shampoo will stimulate growth.</li>
    <li> My hair is Ok, I bought this like a gift to my scalp and hair :) I wanna see them well off after years.  After first wash I really feel my hair stronger and more healthy, also This shampoo smells so cool... And shipment was rapid From UK  to USA and I hope it will stay so for my next purchases.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! Recommended it to my sister and we both love this. Feel a difference in our hair just weeks after using. If you have dry scalp avoid using daily. I use twice a week and that&#x27;s already enough !</li>
    <li> To me. No any improvement after use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it with Minoxidil and they are really good couple for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It worth to try</li>
    <li> Hair growing shampoo is good</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t review many products.  I believe this is my second or third review.  I only review something if my satisfaction with it really stands out. As for the shampoo, just as a shampoo, it is great.  I love the smell (it has a very manly smell lol), and I love the way it leaves my hair.  I normally have to use conditioner, but I don&#x27;t have to with this shampoo.    But I got this shampoo mostly for the hope that it may help with hair loss.  In that respect, I have been using the shampoo about 2 months, so it is difficult for me to honestly say with 100% certainty that it has helped, but I feel confident that it has.  By about a month to month and a half mark of using it, I have definitely noticed I am shedding less hair.  It is undeniable that I am shedding less.  I did rough counts of how much hair I shed virtually every day for a while before I used the shampoo and now after using it.  There is no doubt I am shedding less.  This isn&#x27;t placebo, this is actual counts of hairs shed, that can&#x27;t be denied.  I used to shed tons of hair in the shower, and then tons of hair all throughout the day.  every few hours I would go to the bathroom, run my hands through my hair, and I would shed 20 hairs.  I would take a shower and shed another 50.  Now at about the 2 month mark, I still shed about 40 or 50 hairs in the shower, but I seem to shed about 20 more hairs for the entire rest of the day, whereas before I would shed 50 hairs in the shower, and then probably another 100 or more throughout the day. Can I say absolutely that the decrease in shedding is the shampoo?  No, but I haven&#x27;t used anything else, and my shedding was consistent for a year so I don&#x27;t know what else would have done it.    As for regrowth, I am not certain, as it has only been 2 months.  I have had some finer hairs on my hairline starting to grow in, and I have just noticed that they are starting to thicken up towards the root.  Whether they would have thickened like that without the shampoo, I don&#x27;t know, but it isn&#x27;t a risk I want to take.  My hair has shed less, and I am more than satisfied with this as a shampoo.  I am currently on no medications, like propecia or rogaine.  Although I am going to see a doctor to ask if I should.  In the meantime I am very satisfied with this as a shampoo, and something to add to the fight against hair loss.  I am not going to say this will prevent hair loss if you are destined to be a norwood 7, but I will say, I don&#x27;t think you will find a better shampoo out there, to help slow it down.    I want to make one note for how I use the product.  Because I can foresee people putting this on their hands, giving their hands a quick run through their hair and washing it out, and personally I don&#x27;t see this helping that much.  I massage this shampoo into my scalp, and continue to massage it into my scalp for 5 minute before washing it out.  I will get the suds from the shampoo and compress it with my hands onto my scalp and then massage, then I will slowly add a little water to my hands to make the shampoo more watery and hopefully more easy to penetrate the hair follicle.  This is how I use it.  Do I have any evidence this is the most effective method? No, but it seems logical, and it works for me.    **UPDATE**  Well it has been about 4 months I think since I started using this shampoo and I am still completely happy with it.  While I have a prescription for Propecia now, I honestly am not sure if I am going to start it yet, even though if you asked me 4 months ago, I would have said I would have taken Propecia the first chance I get.  But now 4 months later, IDK if it is the shampoo or my hairloss just slowed naturally, but my hair appears at least as thick as it was 4 months ago, maybe even thicker.  So I really don&#x27;t know if I am going to start Propecia yet.  I think I may wait a little longer.  But 4 months later I have to say I am still completely satisfied with this shampoo. I had tried Nizoral before this, but this honestly seems like as best as you are going to get with a shampoo treatment.  I say try it, if you don&#x27;t feel it is helping by the end of the first bottle, then don&#x27;t get it again, because I think by the end of the first bottle you should notice less hairloss, I have.      **UPDATE 1/29/15**     Eventually I did go to a dermatologist and get prescribed Propecia as a preventative measure. After taking it a few months I did get side effects unfortunately so I stopped. After that I decided to give Rogaine another shot. The first time on Rogaine I started to get some palpitations, so this time I decided to put a little less on and to ALWAYS wash my hands after application, and those two factors kept the side effects away. So right now I am using Rogaine foam in the morning and liquid at night mostly I apply it on my hairline and brush it back with my fingers even though it is not directed for the hairline. I use the foam because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy for the whole day and I use the liquid at night because I believe the liquid may be slightly more effective. Also with the liquid I can get the generic version and save money.    So that said it is very difficult to say what has helped me most. I have been using this shampoo and alternating it with Nizoral (also potentially helps hairloss) and regular shampoo. My hair on my crown which I had definitely noticed thinning has ceased getting worse. The hair on my hairline has receded slightly, but I have a mole that makes it fairly easy to measure, and in the last 4 years, it hasn&#x27;t receded much. I would say I saw some regrowth on my crown, and my hairline has been for the most part holding with possibly a very slight recession. Again, it is hard to say which product has worked best for me, because I wasn&#x27;t willing to lose hair to experiment with only using one.     My recommendation would be to get Nizoral shampoo and use it once a week, 2 at most, and then use this shampoo 3 times a week, and then regular shampoo the other 2 days. I would also recommend either Propecia or Rogaine. While Propecia is definitely most effective, I got side effects with it and I kind of regret taking it, although I would have hated if I never gave it a chance. If you don&#x27;t get side effects with it, then Propecia could very likely save you for at least 10 years and is your best bet if you need more than just to hold where you are but need significant regrowth. Just be warned that I would bet side effects are far more likely than the studies suggest, and not all of them completely go away after you stop. So if you don&#x27;t want to go on Propecia or had side effects, I highly recommend the combination of Rogaine and these two shampoos. I wouldn&#x27;t expect temple regrowth, but I would recommend it for some crown regrowth and a significant slowing of temple loss.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff... I don&#x27;t think it grows hairs back, but it makes the ones you have thicker, especially if you leave it in for 5 minutes... don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s good for you, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Although this shampoo&#x27;s claim-to-fame is that it purportedly re-grows hair, or at least prevents continued hair loss, however, what&#x27;s substantive is this product&#x27;s ability to deliver pleasant feeling on the scalp and promote thick, healthy-looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the limited availability in the USA which results in a elevated cost, Ces&#x27;t La Vie!</li>
    <li> It really did not do the magic it was supposed to do. Could be because I did not follow the instructions at the back! But the shampoo smells really good.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO..NICE SMELL..MAKES MY HAIR FULL AND IS GOOD FOR HAIR LOSS..TO SLOW DOWN..I&#x27;m using for a couple of years now and i/m going to keep using</li>
    <li> Been using the product for about a month now and i have no hair on my comb. I am not sure if any hair is growing but it is not falling out as bad.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. If anything it made my hair fall out more than before.</li>
    <li> just started using this product works well and smells good lets see how it preforms long term. no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s my take on this stuff. It does not regrow hair. If you are in the advanced stages of hair loss, don&#x27;t expect this stuff to give you Bieber hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after using this product daily for a month, I&#x27;m fairly certain it does STOP hair shedding while simultaneously thickening existing hairs. If you are in the early stages of hair thinning, I challenge you to give this product a try. The smell is great, besides.</li>
    <li> At first I could feel my scalp tingle after 2 minutes of it soaking in, but after first month, I don&#x27;t feel anything anymore, undecided if it will help in hair loss, but seems to be a great addition to the dual action shampoo that I use every other day for dandruff.</li>
    <li> Great product! For me, it helped immensely with thinning hair and breakage.</li>
    <li> I actually see my hair improve when I use this. I see new little hairs.</li>
    <li> im using this shampoo and its good for daily use.</li>
    <li> I realize that this product is catered to often desperate people searching for any solution. Personally, I must say: The Germans did it! Granted, I&#x27;m obliged to say, I was not suffering from severe or even moderate baldness, I was in the process of losing my hair and got frightened. I stumbled upon online research articles on the effects of Caffeine in hair growth and purchased this product days later. It is a little more pricey than your average shampoo, considering it is not sold in the U.S.; however, it is reasonably priced and cheaper than Rogaine with no side effects. Moreover, you can&#x27;t put a price on your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to advocate this product if only to get people to at least try it. I bought this item to indulge my curiosity and don&#x27;t regret it. Within the first few DAYS my scalp felt different - thicker and fuller. If nothing else, it did that for sure. Alpecin is a good shampoo in general and in my opinion works. I cannot attest to any regrowth at this time (I&#x27;ve been using it for one month) but again, I can assure you my scalp is much thicker than before. As soon as I combed my hand through my hair after using it, my hair felt like it used to when i was a kid and it was no longer thin and shedding but felt strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least try the shampoo if your worried about hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I am a 22 year old man using this product for your clarification.</li>
    <li> Has nice scent. Not sure if it is truly &amp;#34;energizing&amp;#34; but it does the job well enough. Will have to see its effect over time</li>
    <li> This is surprisingly a good product.  It works.  I just hope this product was available from Walmart for the same price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey, but well worth the cost. MAKES MY HAIR FULL AND IS GOOD FOR HAIR LOSS.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the limited availability in the USA which results in a elevated cost.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I must say: The Germans did it! Granted, I&#x27;m obliged to say, I was not suffering from severe or even moderate baldness, I was in the process of losing my hair and got frightened.Has nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;It worth to try.</li>
    <li> what would happen if I leave it longer than two minutes</li>
    <li> I had lost nearly 80% of the hair in the \\&quot;horseshoe\\&quot; of my head and tried this shampoo when we were at a friends house in Europe.....After 1 month I have significant growth throughout the balding area. I will use this shampoo forever.</li>
    <li> I HIGHLY recommend it to anybody that wants to get rid of dandruff and hair loos.&lt;br /&gt;I tried many other shampoos and this one is only right to me. Great product form Alpacin.</li>
    <li> not sure about increase, but this does keep from your hair falling (or atleast reduces it) did get rid of all the dandruff and smells good too</li>
    <li> so far so good.  makes your hair more course.  haven&#x27;t been able to tell if there is any regrowth there yet.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and the tingly feeling.</li>
    <li> The product is as defined, just started to use it.  However, in retrospect I felt the vendor overcharges.  (i.e., you can get the same product elsewhere for much cheaper)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 months now.  As a shampoo it does a fine job of cleaning your hair and scalp.  As far for how effective it is, the jury is still out.  When you leave it on your head for about 3-5 minutes you can feel it tingling.  Whether it is actually working or just giving my scalp a tingling sensation, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been losing my hair for close to a decade, and started using Rogain foam about 2 years with success.  So it is hard to tell if this shampoo is doing anything to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can tell you is that I have tried many other shampoos, that haven&#x27;t done anything, and that have also been 2 to 3 times more expensive then this.  As a supplement to my rogain, I think this shampoo is good, especially at the price point it is at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it completely stop hair loss.  Probably not.  Would I stop using Rogain, and just continue with it?  No.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using only this to fight your hairloss.  However, as a supplement to either Rogain or Propecia, I think this works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it a 2 for the smell. The price is crazy high. I used it for about 5 months and it did nothing to my hair. I was hoping that I&#x27;d get lucky.</li>
    <li> I had a severe hair loss and I read thar caffein might help with hair loss. I bought this shampoo and apply it as its direction says. However, after using it I experienced more hair shedding. so stopped using it, and back to my suave simple shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really notice a difference in volume and notice a bit of regrowth in the front of my hairline after 6 weeks of 3/wk use. That&#x27;s awesome, however, this is not formulated for women. I noticed a definite decrease in shine and my hair got progressively drier with each use. I added a deep conditioner which is helping but I will try some other brands tailored to women before purchasing again. Note- it does have parabens listed in ingredients if you are trying to avoid them.</li>
    <li> After using for about a week, I noticed much less hair loss. A Google search will reveal some different methods to control hair loss due to DHT in scalp/hair follicle.</li>
    <li> Smell like guys&#x27; shampoo but who cares if it works!</li>
