      <li>Why did I wait so long to buy a really good and cute hair dryer!!  </li>
      <li>Love that it has a cool setting and a flash button!  </li>
      <li>Okay, I have fine hair</li>
      <li>Since I loved the dryer so much</li>
      <li>Great product and super fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and easy to pack for carry-on luggage.</li>
      <li>If you drop this dryer it will break easily and there is no repairing it.</li>
      <li>It does start off rather cool, but it always heats up more about 30-60 seconds into blow drying.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super cute...   </li>
      <li>A huge step up from the one it replaced.  </li>
      <li>Feels cheap.  </li>
      <li>Feels solid and works great.</li>
      <li>Looks cheap.  </li>
      <li>I guess I will pay more and get the blue one I loved.</li>
      <li>I am glad that the &#x27;cool&#x27; setting is indeed that, COOL AIR, not just unheated air.  </li>
      <li>Very powerful dryer.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>If it is then it was either used or refurbished and not returned to is original state.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It really gives my hair volume &amp; I love the buttons being on the side of the dyer.</li>
      <li>Yes, its not super hot -- but heat isn&#x27;t good either!</li>
      <li>Super powerful, blows a lot of air.  </li>
      <li>Has three setting on both the heat and on the blower and let me tell you, the highest settings are hot and powerful!</li>
      <li>but the watts are so high that it keeps blowing fuses all the time!!!</li>
      <li>My first high priced hair dryer and I love it.</li>
      <li>Luckily, it&#x27;s real , but that&#x27;s how cheap it felt</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny..</li>
      <li>I can have my hair dry/styled in about 3 minutes with this powerful blow dryer and that is on the medium heat.  </li>
      <li>It is certainly worth the $59.95 I paid for it.</li>
      <li>I think the reason most people complain about button placement is because they are so used to the position of their old hairdryers.</li>
      <li>I know this because I also own the true black titanium nano portifino</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough love this one</li>
      <li>I bought this hairdryer more than year ago when my last one lit on fire.</li>
      <li>I was using a cheap dryer from Sally&#x27;s that completely destroyed my curly hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Temperature: The hot setting gets pretty hot.</li>
      <li>The nozel isn&#x27;t even hot after use.</li>
      <li>for this exact dryer.  </li>
      <li>After all, it is just blowing hot air, but I guess that I can say that it dries quickly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far I have really liked this hairdryer, it is hot, powerful and helps straighten my hair as I dry it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works great on my fine hair, lots of air, love the heat settings, and the pattern is fun.</li>
    <li> I got the leopard print and it&#x27;s beautiful!!!&lt;br /&gt;this model is a little bit heavier than the Babyliss TT tourmaline titanium (the white one), but it does dry the hair in HALF the time!!! I have long hair around the middle of my back and I dried it completely in 4m25s. With the Babyliss TT it would take about 8-9 minutes. Do this is completely worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this blow drier. Cut my blow dry time in half. I bought the leopard/cheetah print one. The price on this item has changed significantly, unfortunately. When I purchased, this dryer was significantly less expensive than other colors of the same model. Before ordering and receiving I was concerned it was a knock off because it was cheaper than the other two color options. I do think it is real. It works well. Feels well made. I looked at all of the instructions closely on the box for spelling/grammar mistakes which are common with fakes and found none. I&#x27;ve had about 2 months now and it works well. I also had one of my good friends look at it closely. She is a cosmetologist and currently works at a salon that sells this brand. She said it looked authentic to her.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer! Best dryer ever! It cut down drying time to 5 - 10 minutes rather than 20 minutes! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it but the watts are so high that it keeps blowing fuses all the time!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This is my second Portofino 6600.  My daughter and I have thick, long, curly hair.  This dryer cuts down the drying time by more than half.  The first is still going strong after two years of daily heavy use.  Also very pleased  with the diffusser and concentrating attachments.  This dryer has by FAR outperformed other well known brands costing two or more times the price.  I would do commercials for this dryer!</li>
    <li> Amazing hair dryer. The nozel isn&#x27;t even hot after use. Best investment</li>
    <li> I bought for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;My wife choose this one.&lt;br /&gt;She said it works very good.&lt;br /&gt;She likes it.&lt;br /&gt;But little heavy.</li>
    <li> Amazing blow dryer! Worth every penny! I have naturally curly hair and this blow dryer gets it almost totally straight! Amazing power and heat! Product just like expected and shipping was fast for the free option. Got it in about a week!</li>
    <li> A huge step up from the one it replaced.  Feels solid and works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer more than year ago when my last one lit on fire. I choose this one because I know the Babyliss name and I loved the pattern. The pattern IS actually as cute as it looks in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weight: This dryer weighs about as much as a weighted tape dispenser. It feels like a professional hair dryer and is not easy to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design: The cord on the dryer is somewhat rigid and unwieldy. It became easier to wrangle when I bought Velcro ties for the cord (On Amazon: VELCRO Brand - ONE-WRAP Thin Self-Gripping Cable Ties: Reusable, Light Duty - 8&amp;#34; x 1/2&amp;#34; Ties, 100 Pack - Black)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed of drying: I can&#x27;t say much here. After all, it is just blowing hot air, but I guess that I can say that it dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temperature: The hot setting gets pretty hot. Not hot enough to burn your scalp, but hot enough to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Has three setting on both the heat and on the blower and let me tell you, the highest settings are hot and powerful! This is a fantastic styling tool, comparable with my stylists dryer for sure! I highly recommend this dryer. AND IT&#x27;S ANIMAL PRINT!!! BONUS!</li>
    <li> As a man I take pride in always being ready at a moments notice, but if you have a girlfriend you know that&#x27;s not always true and sitting around waiting for her to get ready can be a pain when all you want to do is get to the party and have a few beers with your friends, with this bad boy she can dry/do her hair in 20mins or less (not including shower time, make up time and dress up time) Imagine waiting only an hour instead of 3! This has saved me time, money on the electric bill, and my relationship, plus chicks love leopard print, and it works great on my dogs (don&#x27;t tell my gf)</li>
    <li> love this dryer! i have medium length curly hair and this dryer cut my drying time buy 2/3rds. the diffuser is a big help when drying curly hair and it is hard to find 1 like this. and it was included with the dryer. my local beauty supply store charged $150. for this exact dryer.  i would not have chosen this leopard but i could not resist the great price. i like the print now that i have it. sorry i waited so long to order.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is powerful and great for straightening wavy hair.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a quality hair dryer</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! It really gives my hair volume &amp; I love the buttons being on the side of the dyer.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law was a hair stylist and owns and recommended this hair dryer. I saw the great reviews and good price for the leopard version that includes a diffuser so excitedly bought it. I am so disappointed in this hair dryer! I can see if you have straight, thick hair it would be great, the motor sounds good and the heat/speed is good. But while I have a lot of wavy/curly hair, the texture is on the finer side. The diffuser is awful!! It&#x27;s not deep enough and even on the lowest setting just blew my hair all over the place. I wanted to love this, but after a few uses gave up and returned. My search continues!</li>
    <li> Not sure why the reviews are spectacular. Doesn&#x27;t dry faster, is heavy, is ugly (bough leopard print since was $20 cheaper) and blows my hair into giant knots that I end up having to break and pull out hair. Product and detanglers make no difference and I have to use a lower setting or constantly brush vigorously while drying to prevent. I have reverted to my $10 Conair which works better. As a working physician using this product nearly daily, this is a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  I was using a cheap dryer from Sally&#x27;s that completely destroyed my curly hair.  This dryer is awesome and delivery was fast!</li>
    <li> Love it! best dryer yet. So powerful, and you can full blast on cold if you want.</li>
    <li> LOVE this, I have thick, long hair.  With a standard hairdryer it an take a half hour.  With this I can be done under 10 drying and styling, under 5 if I just want to get my hair reasonably dry before trowing it into a pony tail.</li>
    <li> I received my leopard Babyliss dryer from Beauty And, and I believe it is the real thing - not a counterfit. The packaging, accessories, and dryer all appear to be very well-made with great attention to detail. The cord is quite thick and long; you can tell by the cord alone that it is a powerful machine. It is the best hairdryer I have ever owned and it dried my very long fine blonde hair in under 5 minutes, without much heat at all (seems like it would cause less damage to hair). It is certainly worth the $59.95 I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer for my granddaughter who is going to beauty school and who wanted a quality hairdryer for her own use.  She loves it and it was delivered in time for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Bought this a a gift for my wife. She loves it and loved how it shortens the drying time. Wen My mother comes for a visit from out of town she loves it as well and would get it if she hadn&#x27;t just recently bought a lower model.</li>
    <li> Why did I wait so long to buy a really good and cute hair dryer!!  Definitely my favorite hair dyer ever....</li>
    <li> I purchased the Leopard print Babyliss Nano Titanium Portofino 6600 Hair Dryer.  It definitely cuts the drying time for my hair.  I am glad that the &#x27;cool&#x27; setting is indeed that, COOL AIR, not just unheated air.  My hair has appeared shinier with less frizz.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> So far I have really liked this hairdryer, it is hot, powerful and helps straighten my hair as I dry it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now. I previously had a Revlon with retractable cord that still worked, but it was REALLY hot. I have oily hair, so I have to wash it pretty much daily. The heat was killing my long hair. I took a chance on this and I am really glad I did. Initially, I was disappointed, but I am glad I stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Power! It has almost too much power for someone with long hair, my hair was FLYING all over the place (it also tangles easily). I added one of the 3 concentration nozzles and that really helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Heat! Yes, its not super hot -- but heat isn&#x27;t good either! It does start off rather cool, but it always heats up more about 30-60 seconds into blow drying. With as much power going through it, I don&#x27;t think you need as much heat to accomplish getting dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Buttons! Yes, the buttons are on the side. I think the reason most people complain about button placement is because they are so used to the position of their old hairdryers. It takes some time to get used to a new one. I think people notice the difference a lot at first, but it really will go away and you&#x27;ll get used to it. It hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with this blow dryer. I can&#x27;t say that my hair dries any faster than my previous dryer, but it will be much healthier in the long run and that&#x27;s something I appreciate more than speed. It definitely does not take a long time by any means though. I am happy I got it!</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer! It&#x27;s a beast and my hair loves it. My hair is softer. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed a new blow dryer until this. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair in half the time.  The attachments are great and the frizz is gone!</li>
    <li> Super powerful, blows a lot of air.  I had a much more expensive hairdryer that was almost double the price for the past 6 years before this one and this one is even more powerful than my old one.  I need a strong hairdryer b/c I have very thick hair.  Just to give you an idea, wall mounted hair dryers at hotels are totally useless to me.  If I plan to dry my hair while traveling, I have to bring one.  This one comes with a bunch of different attachments.  And I like the animal print (although my husband does not but that print was much cheaper for some reason than the solid color ones)</li>
    <li> My first high priced hair dryer and I love it. As long as you keep it on LOW heat it&#x27;s Great!!! High will burn you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not fussy on the color, but for the price, I don&#x27;t care. I want my hairdryer to last many years with daily use. This dryer looks like it will last. I have used it everyday for 7mos so far and it has worked flawlessly; it looks and functions as the day I bought it. The cord is heavy duty and the vent on the back is a little delicate, but it has a metal screen and is removable for easy lint removal.</li>
    <li> So far, I like this hair dryer.  It is very strong and has really helped cut down on my dry time.</li>
    <li> Great product... Took me anywhere between 30-40 mins to blow dry my clients hair with my old blow drier.... With this new one its cut the time in half... It&#x27;s has lots of power... Great deal... N it&#x27;s super cute...   Update: 7-8?months later it only blows cold air. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this drier for the price they are selling it now. It&#x27;s rubbish</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer I have ever owned, dries your hair so fast!</li>
    <li> Bought the leopard version of this blow dryer because of the cheaper price and I LOVE it. It is a great blowdryer and I would recommend it to every hair stylist. UPDATE: now 7-8 months later my blowdryer is broken. I really loved this blowdryer but mine just stopped work and only blows cold air now. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Cut my drying time in half. And no more static! Very powerful dryer. Lightweight and easy to pack for carry-on luggage. Extra long cord. Will not disappoint! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer I have ever used!  I bought a second Babyliss Nano after my first purchase.  Multiple heat and air settings.  Gets the job done pronto.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer I have ever owned!! It is worth every penny.. I went to my local Sally&#x27;s and bought two they were 35.00 each.. I had to buy a new one due to my daughter dropped it and Sally&#x27;s does not have these so I found it on Amazon thank goodness.. If you drop this dryer it will break easily and there is no repairing it. Your hair looks great when you use this one... I will never plan to buy another dryer except this one.. I can&#x27;t say enough love this one so I highly recommend this dryer..</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer in May and ever since I got it, when I turn it on it runs for a while and then it just shuts off , I have to wait between 10 and 15 minutes for it to come back on.  I would really like an exchange and I have not figured out how to contct you.  This hair dryer is still under warranty.  Please advise me what I am supposed to do as this was a pretty expensive hair dryer and it has been cutting out since I got it.  I could not find a way to reach you.  Hoping someone will contact me soon.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife and she claims this to be the most amazing thing ever. I&#x27;ve bought my wife her wedding ring and band, a car, clothing, a dog and I&#x27;m pretty sure I got a bigger reaction in giving this to her than all of the above. 6 months later she still says after ever use how much better this is than her old one! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Looks cheap.  Feels cheap.  But.... It works.  My hair feels great. The motor is insane.  It&#x27;s gets hott! Like burn your hand hott.  I actually called corporate of babyliss to check serial numbers and make sure this wasn&#x27;t a knock off. Luckily, it&#x27;s real , but that&#x27;s how cheap it felt, I almost thought it was fake.</li>
    <li> Awesome! If you like to save time and be able to straighten you hair quickly this is a great deal... and it looks cool!  Love that it has a cool setting and a flash button!  I have nothing bad to say about this purchase!</li>
    <li> Great product dryers quickly</li>
    <li> I used to have the blue version until I dropped it on a ceramic tile floor and damaged it. Since I loved the dryer so much I thought I would by another and saw this one was cheaper. So I ordered it. Well, when I plugged it in it didn&#x27;t go on until I jiggled the cord coming from the bottom but then it would go on then off. I promptly returned it. I guess I will pay more and get the blue one I loved.</li>
    <li> Okay, I have fine hair so my hair doesn&#x27;t take that long to dry.....I can have my hair dry/styled in about 3 minutes with this powerful blow dryer and that is on the medium heat.  Great dryer with a nice leopard pattern.</li>
    <li> This is not the titanium nano portifino. If it is then it was either used or refurbished and not returned to is original state. It overheats and has damaged my hair because it is not working correctly. I know this because I also own the true black titanium nano portifino and it&#x27;s an incredible hair dryer and my fiance is a stylist. Disappointed</li>
