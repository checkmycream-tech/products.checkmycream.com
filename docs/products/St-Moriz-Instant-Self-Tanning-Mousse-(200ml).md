      <li>I really love this product!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>All in all, I love this self tanner!</li>
      <li>Gives excellent color, dries fast, and no streaks!  </li>
      <li>One of the ingredients is parfum, so that does a nice job to camouflage the smell when applied.  </li>
      <li>it kind of reminds me of the Toni tanning stuff</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not quite as good and the color takes many applications to acheive.  </li>
      <li>The color is nice.</li>
      <li>I think this stuff is pretty close to perfect and until I find something better, I&#x27;ll def keep repurchasing.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to purchase this product after reading so many great reviews.  </li>
      <li>It does not smell, I don&#x27;t get streaks, it&#x27;s easy to work with, bendable, and it does not turn me orange!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s by far my FAVORITE!!!  </li>
      <li>I am very fair and with this on, I&#x27;ve had compliments on having such a nice looking tan.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite self tanner.</li>
      <li>do make sure you wear gloves while applying.</li>
      <li>so I decided to try St. Moritz considering many</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still going to use it on my arms &amp; neck &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>The color is gorgeous, and the mousse goes on so light and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many tanning products from Sunlove to St. Tropez and those all make you orange.  </li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s way better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve Never tried St Moriz but will be since I love getting airbrushed.  </li>
      <li>Many people who have used this product say that it is almost identical to the $40 St. Tropez sunless tanner sold in the U.S.</li>
      <li>Overall,this is a really good self-tan and worth the price.</li>
      <li>St. Moriz is, in my opinion, better than St. Tropez.  </li>
      <li>This was the DARKEST, MOST STREAKY product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to rub it in, just make sure you are covered.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll LOVE it too.</li>
      <li>slightly however one of the best I&#x27;ve tried for sure!</li>
      <li>The scent is very clean, almost like soap.</li>
      <li>It give&#x27;s you a nice brown color the very first time &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>Application is easy.</li>
      <li>Good product, goes on pretty evenly and gives color right away.</li>
      <li>I do agree that the mousse is nice and easy to apply and the texture and scent is much like St. Tropez and for that reason I will continue to use it....</li>
      <li>I have however, tried many drugstore self tanners over the last 20 years and this by far is the best I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>This comes in very handy with the back area.</li>
      <li>I read many, many reviews prior to placing my order and most were favorable</li>
      <li>I was really excited when I purchased this product.</li>
      <li>it looks soo real and its so easy to put on!</li>
      <li>I also find that the product works best if i apply it before i go to bed so that it is fully developed by the time i put my makeup on the next morning.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t streak and it gave me a nice, light,and natural looking tan!  </li>
      <li>The mitt is good to apply the mousse to your back.  </li>
      <li>I wear to bed and then wash it off in the morning, and I am left with a gorgeous colour.</li>
      <li>Okay, so I really wanted to get the St.Tropez..</li>
      <li>The only problem is it can come out watery and runny if you dont shake it really really good first.</li>
      <li>This was the first self tanning mousse I had ever tried, and I was definitely not disappointed.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite self-tanner by far!  </li>
      <li>I am a very fair skinned blonde and one application was not enough even for me.</li>
      <li>The other day I tried St Tropez Bronzing Spray and the application was great, easy and not messy.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you wear gloves or wash hand frequently during application.</li>
      <li>It dries in seconds and with one application, it gives me golden tint.</li>
      <li>However, this is using it on top of my natural tan from the summer..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m blonde haired, blue eyed and moderately fair but generally do okay with self tanners.</li>
      <li>This is probably the best and most natural fake tan Ive used.</li>
      <li>&quot; all the time - it looks very real.</li>
      <li>deep, dark mousse that dries to a beautiful brown color.&lt;br /&gt;You must move quickly to avoid streaks but nothing that isn&#x27;t manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I orderd 2 the first time &amp; since it&#x27;s not quite spring/summer</li>
      <li>giving to my South American friends, hope they have better luck.</li>
      <li>I have pink undertones to my skin and this did not make me look orange and in fact looked more natural than most things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>On the other hand the best way to apple St Moriz mousse or any other self tanners that come in a lotion or mousse form is to exfoliate your skin, apply moisturizer on your knees, elbows, wrists, armpits, around ankles and feet as well as hands.  </li>
      <li>First, I&#x27;ve been using St. Tropez for years</li>
      <li>more brown/golden/olive without being yellow or orangey.</li>
      <li>This product does NOT go on smoothly, does NOT blend, and does NOT look even remotely natural.</li>
      <li>One application lasted almost 7 days, and I could re-apply once every 5 or 6 days for a gorgeous tan year round.  </li>
      <li>I have fair skin with a yellow undertones so for those who have the same undertone I don&#x27;t suggest you try it.  </li>
      <li>It dries within seconds and leaves your skin feeling super soft.</li>
      <li>so I strongly advise you keep latex gloves on and do your hands last.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also not quite as blendable as St. Tropez and considering I have large pores</li>
      <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I really hoped this would be the self tanning lotion for me.</li>
      <li>Once fully covered keep latex gloves on and using St Tropez mitt rub gently your skin to even out the lotion.  </li>
      <li>The color is very close to my real tan.  </li>
      <li>For one, the color on me is more natural and not as red toned-</li>
      <li>&amp; I can only imgine the next time i put it on &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>For the price, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>and I had to SCRUB my face until it was red and irritated before I was willing to go out of my house!</li>
      <li>Moriz &amp; it was like a complete dupe for St.Tropez!!</li>
      <li>It makes application so easy and with a little practice I can do my whole body in well under 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>I have read of one new product that has something in it to counteract whatever it is that makes it smell.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of messy and it stained my white bikini</li>
      <li>so I did my research [usually always on youtube &#x3D;] ]</li>
      <li>The quality is amazing for such a little price!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for everyday application and will look dark after about 4 days.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Okay, so I really wanted to get the St.Tropez..but I mean 40 some somthing for tanning lotion??. NOT COOL. so I did my research [usually always on youtube &#x3D;] ] &amp; I found this little guy St.Moriz &amp; it was like a complete dupe for St.Tropez!! &amp; I LOVE iT!! It give&#x27;s you a nice brown color the very first time &#x3D;] &amp; I can only imgine the next time i put it on &#x3D;] The smell is NOT over barring &amp; it&#x27;s not strong | it kind of reminds me of the Toni tanning stuff [the lady from QVC]  I orderd 2 the first time &amp; since it&#x27;s not quite spring/summer JUST YET. I&#x27;m still going to use it on my arms &amp; neck &#x3D;] So I will DEF. be re-purchising this product SOON! It&#x27;s only downfall is that it&#x27;s NOT avaible here in the U.S.A &#x3D;/ only U.K. But atleast i can get it through Amazon..I&#x27;am one happy campier &#x3D;D &amp; you will be too, just give it a try! you&#x27;ll LOVE it too.</li>
    <li> All other sunless tanners i have used leave me with a strange orange color. This is the only tanner that gives me a nice dark tan with absolutely no orange tint. Many people who have used this product say that it is almost identical to the $40 St. Tropez sunless tanner sold in the U.S. It does not smell bad like other sunless tanners, and it is not streaky as long as you blend it in well. The only downside is that it will stain you hands if you don&#x27;t wash them immediately after applying the product. To avoid this i use a cotton ball or sponge to apply the product. I also find that the product works best if i apply it before i go to bed so that it is fully developed by the time i put my makeup on the next morning. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve Never tried St Moriz but will be since I love getting airbrushed.  It&#x27;s expensive so I&#x27;m looking at trying other things.  The other day I tried St Tropez Bronzing Spray and the application was great, easy and not messy.  No rubbing required, it went on evenly.  It comes in an arosal can.  However after my shower the color of my skin was yellowish orange. I have fair skin with a yellow undertones so for those who have the same undertone I don&#x27;t suggest you try it.  I was disappointed.  On the other hand the best way to apple St Moriz mousse or any other self tanners that come in a lotion or mousse form is to exfoliate your skin, apply moisturizer on your knees, elbows, wrists, armpits, around ankles and feet as well as hands.  Using latex gloves apply the mousse to your skin.  Once fully covered keep latex gloves on and using St Tropez mitt rub gently your skin to even out the lotion.  This will prevent streeks. The mitt is good to apply the mousse to your back.  Apply the lotion to the back side of the mitt and rub onto your back and using the front of your mitt rub it down.  The mousse goes through the mitt so I strongly advise you keep latex gloves on and do your hands last.</li>
    <li> St Moriz, the knock off to St Tropez, has it&#x27;s good and bad. The good. It&#x27;s easy to apply, dries very fast and has almost none of the bad smell that seems to last for days with other self tanning products. You don&#x27;t have to rub it in, just make sure you are covered. This comes in very handy with the back area. This is easy because of the brown/tan base. With a little buffing you can even wear this during the day. I wears off evenly too. The bad. I am a very fair skinned blonde and one application was not enough even for me. I had to reapply it the next day to get any real visual result. Compared to the price of this product vs the St Tropez, you are still coming out ahead even with the two applications vs one. Goes a long way. After three uses I still have over half a bottle left. Bottome line. I keep both on hand. St Moriz for everyday and St Tropez for special events. Scoring from 1 to 5, I would give this product a 3.</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Moriz Self tanning mousse for about 4 months now and I love it!! I heard about it on YouTube and thought I would give it a try.  I heard this is supposed to be a knockoff version on St. Topez self tanner.  I have never tried St. Tropez, so I cannot compare the two.  I have however, tried many drugstore self tanners over the last 20 years and this by far is the best I have ever used.  The color is very close to my real tan.  I hate the self tanner smell, and St. Moriz has almost no smell at all.  I usually apply it with disposable latex gloves, because it goes on with a very dark brown coloring.  I put it on before bed (never stains my sheets) and the next day after I shower, my tan is so natural looking and not streaky at all.  My tan usually lasts about 4 or 5 days before it starts to wear off, and I shower every day.  I have noticed my skin is drier when I use this.  So I have to use a heavier body cream on the days I use St. Moriz. All in all, I love this self tanner! The quality is amazing for such a little price!</li>
    <li> There is nothing I can say bad about this product except that it&#x27;s not available in the US. The mousse is tinted a brown/greenish color so you know exactly what your tan will look like and the green color offsets any orange color. The scent is very clean, almost like soap. It dries within seconds and leaves your skin feeling super soft. The price doesn&#x27;t hurt either. Please come to the US St. Moriz!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased St. Tropez bronzing lotion and I really did like it, however, I was having slight problems with streaks on my legs.  I searched the web for tips on how to prevent this, and I came across St. Moriz.  People said it was a rival comparison to St. Tropez, and at $8 a bottle, I had to try it.  (I paid $38 for St. Tropez) St. Moriz is, in my opinion, better than St. Tropez.  The color is gorgeous, and the mousse goes on so light and smooth.  The color after one application is not quite as dark as that with the St. Tropez lotion, but you can simply apply a second application for a deeper, richer tan.  (I&#x27;m fair skinned, so this is perfect for me!)  One application lasted almost 7 days, and I could re-apply once every 5 or 6 days for a gorgeous tan year round.  Also, I had no streaking with St. Moriz, and the tan fades naturally, big plus!!!  Well worth the money, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!      * Amazon is the only place to find St. Moriz, as it is only sold in the U.K.</li>
    <li> This is a great self tanner. It does not streak, nor smell like you&#x27;ve put on a self tanner, (except maybe the days following, a slight smell can be detected, but probably not by someone else). I am very fair and with this on, I&#x27;ve had compliments on having such a nice looking tan. It lasts about 5 days and then you need to re-apply. I like that when it does start to fade, it just fades. It doesn&#x27;t start blotching off of your skin. I really love this product!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite self-tanner by far!  It is natural looking and give just enough color.  If you are looking for one-time dark application this product is not for you.  This is great if you just want some color and don&#x27;t want to look like a pasty ghost.  It&#x27;s good for everyday application and will look dark after about 4 days.    WEAR GLOVES!  Otherwise everyone will know your secret!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I have pink undertones to my skin and this did not make me look orange and in fact looked more natural than most things I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s also instant so you don&#x27;t have to wait to get the tan look and it stays on if you get in the water.  It dries almost instantly too so do make sure you wear gloves while applying. It&#x27;s still \\&quot;fake\\&quot; so it&#x27;s not perfect and you can get streaks (though rare for me). I recommend applying a small amount of lotion to dry areas before using it. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s not perfect- It&#x27;s kind of messy and it stained my white bikini slightly however one of the best I&#x27;ve tried for sure!</li>
    <li> Good product, goes on pretty evenly and gives color right away. However this washes off as soon as you take a shower.. on me at least. Its great for a night out because you can put it on in the morning and you get a lot of color by night time</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews on utube about this product I decided to give it a try. Gives excellent color, dries fast, and no streaks!  Just make sure you wear gloves or wash hand frequently during application. Only down fall is that it&#x27;s only sold in the UK.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite self tanner. It&#x27;s supposed to be comparable to St. Tropez but I think it&#x27;s way better. For one, the color on me is more natural and not as red toned- more brown/golden/olive without being yellow or orangey. However, this is using it on top of my natural tan from the summer..I have yet to see how it looks when I&#x27;m at my palest in the winter. But the biggest advantage has to be the smell. St. Tropez has a really strong rose/floral scent that I hate, whereas this is totally non-offensive, smells fresh kinda like soap, and I never develop that gross fake tan smell. I recommend getting a mitt to go along with this. It makes application so easy and with a little practice I can do my whole body in well under 10 minutes. It dries in seconds and with one application, it gives me golden tint. To get darker, just keep applying it every day. I finished my first bottle in a little over a month because I was using it all the time and I cant wait to receive my 2nd. I think this stuff is pretty close to perfect and until I find something better, I&#x27;ll def keep repurchasing. For the price, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I loved the St. Moriz Self Tanning Mousse.  It didn&#x27;t streak and it gave me a nice, light,and natural looking tan!  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I really hoped this would be the self tanning lotion for me. I&#x27;m blonde haired, blue eyed and moderately fair but generally do okay with self tanners. This was the DARKEST, MOST STREAKY product I&#x27;ve ever used. I followed all the rules, exfoliated prior to applying, put 1 thin layer on my face and upper body, and went to bed. When I woke up, I looked like a brown zebra! My hands, which I washed repeatedly after applying, were permanently stained for days and I had to SCRUB my face until it was red and irritated before I was willing to go out of my house! Similarly, my arms were covered in brown \\&quot;spots\\&quot; and were especially dark in the crevices of my shoulders and elbows. This product does NOT go on smoothly, does NOT blend, and does NOT look even remotely natural. I&#x27;m really, really disappointed... giving to my South American friends, hope they have better luck.</li>
    <li> great deal for the price.... i have very fair skin and it works for me!!!</li>
    <li> This was the first self tanning mousse I had ever tried, and I was definitely not disappointed. I was a year-round tanning bed client until I decided I wasn&#x27;t going to harm my skin anymore. I don&#x27;t like the smell of lotions, so I decided to give this a try. THIS IS AMAZING!! It does not smell, I don&#x27;t get streaks, it&#x27;s easy to work with, bendable, and it does not turn me orange! People compliment my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; all the time - it looks very real. I will be buying this product for the rest of my life! I apply it with a round makeup sponge. I wear to bed and then wash it off in the morning, and I am left with a gorgeous colour. It will get on your clothes, but don&#x27;t worry, it WILL wash off! If you are unsure about this product, you have nothing to lose! It&#x27;s awesome :)</li>
    <li> I adore this self tanner! I bought it here about a month ago. It doesn&#x27;t smell weird when you put it on (it smells almost soapy) but over time it starts to stink. Honestly that isn&#x27;t so bad. It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes or sheets. If you use it even once or twice you get a little tan (it doesn&#x27;t become super dark, unfortunately). It isn&#x27;t in ANY way orange. I&#x27;ve had people ask me if I went tanning. It lasts about a week or two. I love this! Definitely a steal!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best and most natural fake tan Ive used. It&#x27;s actually brown and doesn&#x27;t streak (too much). It&#x27;s not a real dark tan but its defiantly noticeable and build-able. The only problem is it can come out watery and runny if you dont shake it really really good first. You also might look a little dirty if you dont rub it in really well. Overall,this is a really good self-tan and worth the price.</li>
    <li> I read many, many reviews prior to placing my order and most were favorable but I took all into account before making my decision.  First, I&#x27;ve been using St. Tropez for years and it&#x27;s by far my FAVORITE!!!  Times are tough and although $30 doesn&#x27;t seem much at this time I was just trying to find something that was a bit less expensive so I decided to try St. Moritz considering many raved about it&#x27;s similarities to st. Tropez.  I do agree that the mousse is nice and easy to apply and the texture and scent is much like St. Tropez and for that reason I will continue to use it....but it&#x27;s not quite as good and the color takes many applications to acheive.  It&#x27;s also not quite as blendable as St. Tropez and considering I have large pores the color is much darker on my facial pores and I have to exfoliate everyday just to continue using it but kinda useless since the color really does wash off with any kind of exfoliation or scrubbing.  I will recommend this product as a cheaper version if someone&#x27;s not wanting to spend the extra $24 but I doubt I&#x27;ll purchase it again.  Considering the amount of applications I have to use I might as well as spend the extra money and went with St. Tropez because that lasts me about a year and this product might get me thru the rest of this winter.</li>
    <li> So let me start out by saying i absolutely LOVE this stuff!! this is my fifth bottle im buying i think this stuff is great! I&#x27;ve tried so many tanning products from Sunlove to St. Tropez and those all make you orange.  This stuff tho.....its amazing! it looks soo real and its so easy to put on! i would give this 10 stars if i could i will be buying this for a long time.  Only downside is shipping is super expensive :(</li>
    <li> I was so excited to purchase this product after reading so many great reviews.  Specifically, I read that this one does not have the same \\&quot;stink.\\&quot;    Well, it doesn&#x27;t have the same stink and I figured out why.  There are two reasons.  One of the ingredients is parfum, so that does a nice job to camouflage the smell when applied.  The problem with the stink is that the ingredient used to produce the tan produces a horrible smell many hours after the application.  I have used many of these products and they all do the same because they all use the same active ingredient to produce the color.  I have read of one new product that has something in it to counteract whatever it is that makes it smell.  I have not purchased it because it is very, very expensive.    The other reason this product does not smell as bad is very simple.  It does not produce the same darkness of tan as any of the others I have used in the past.  The tan is very light, therefore, less product and less stink.  I even applied it 4 days in a row, hoping for it to develop a darker tan.  Although it does leave a little tan, I have never seen a product that doesn&#x27;t darken enough.  Usually I use the product once and the next day I have a deep tan (specifically with the Loreal dark tan product).      Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> This product is great!&lt;br /&gt;A deep, dark mousse that dries to a beautiful brown color.&lt;br /&gt;You must move quickly to avoid streaks but nothing that isn&#x27;t manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend applying this AFTER you moisturize, it makes application easier.&lt;br /&gt;I will definately repurchase!</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I purchased this product. The reviews are awesome. But, unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do so well for me. The color is nice. Application is easy. I used a mitt. However, after the bronzer washes off the next morning, I was left with a patchy mess. The inside of my elbows were horrible! So were my wrists and forearms. I tried a few times and I always exfoliated and moisturized. It always ended up the same. not going to buy again. :(</li>
