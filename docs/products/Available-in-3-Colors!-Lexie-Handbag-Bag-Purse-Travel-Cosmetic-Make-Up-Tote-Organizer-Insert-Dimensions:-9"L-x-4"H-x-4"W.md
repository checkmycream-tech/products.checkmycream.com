<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this organizer.  I have tried  several different types of purse organizers and this has been the best so far.  Makes it so easy to change purses.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years in my purse. I like it.</li>
    <li> this is for smaller bags that hold their own form.... not for US who carry larger sized duffles or satchels that are loose in form.... it serves it&#x27;s purpose though in the smaller hard leather bags.... so I will keep it and continue my search or create my own organizer for larger bags....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its actually works really nice... Im glad i purchased it... Still looking for a larger one...</li>
    <li> This is just the solution I was looking for!  It is the perfect size and fits in several bag.  Well constructed, it will last longer than some purses.</li>
    <li> not what i expected at all..alot smaller than the size listed!! not worth the price i payed for it at all!!</li>
    <li> This is a handy organizer for smaller to medium sized purses.  It also fits perfectly into the console of my Highlander to keep it organized, even though I didn&#x27;t plan for this use when I bought it. Consoles of any vehicle tend to be large enough that you have to dig to find things.  With this organizer, there is no more of that.  Everything can be clearly seen and accessed easily.  The handles also make cleaning a breeze.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Rummaging through a disorganized handbag for an important item ruins an otherwise professional, put-together image. This insert ends the sloppy search for wallet, change, keys, makeup, tissues. In just a few minutes, I was able to turn the messy hoard lurking in the depths of my dark handbag into a neat, bright, organized array, with everything at my fingertips. This organizer is perfect for a medium-sized satchel, and also would be a great addition to a large tote. It&#x27;s also easy to lift out and put into a different bag, ending the dread of \\&quot;Oh no, I have to change handbags!\\&quot; For an average or small number of items, this insert works perfectly. If you have extra large or bulky items in your bag, you may want to get a larger insert. Several of these would work together nicely in a suitcase or a dresser drawer, too. Love this product!</li>
    <li> The other reviewers already have this nifty little product down-pat. I&#x27;m just here to express my satisfaction with it.  This little organizer fits into all of my purses, helps me find everything easily, stays upright easily and can fit quite a bit of stuff in it. I like the handles which helps me easily transfer it from bag to bag. And yes, the bag is reversible to fit into smaller sized purses.  Now I can find all my bits and pieces, my umbrella, my lip balm, my whatever you get the point. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t to happy with product. Picture of products was misleading. Wish pduct was a bit bigger to suit a bigger purses. Overall quality seemed good.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this.  It holds SO much, is well-made and very sturdy.  It transformed my unruly hobo bag into a very organized tote so I no longer have to spend time searching my bag for keys, pens, wallet, etc.  Wish I knew about this years ago!</li>
    <li> Initially, this bag was very chemical/plastic smelling.  I set it out in the sun for a day and the smell dissipated.  Great organizer for my purse.  Doesn&#x27;t fit in narrower purses, but for most it works well.  The pockets are deep enough that you can fit more than one thing inside, which is very helpful.  The only \\&quot;problem\\&quot; is that sometimes the handles get in the way when reaching in, but they are also great for removing the organizer to sort or switch purses.</li>
    <li> The picture is very deceiving. it is very small. If you order this product, make sure you are satisfied with the size. It would be perfect for a small bag. On a positive side, it is very sturdy.</li>
    <li> This was a little smaller than I expected. It goes well into a smaller bag, but with bigger ones, it becomes a little lost. It is handy and useful for many things though other than a handbag bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> This was a great investment - I bought one for me and one for a friend - they are great for your purse - you can find everything all the time - nothing is burried at the bottom of your bag.</li>
    <li> I really tortured myself going back and forth with the different kinds of bag organizers out there, finally deciding on this one.  When it arrived I thought it was smaller than I had imagined it would be, but then I started moving things into it and it really does hold everything.  The light color is nice too, darker colors make it harder to see objects in a bag.  Overall very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is so handy, keeps me organized in my purses, easy transfer when changing purses.  Also makes a nice caddy on dresser.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Big Budda bag I own which is like a bottomless pit! At first I thought it was too small until I loaded it up for a test run.....I absolutely could not belive it fit all my stuff!!! Most of my handbags are meduim to xtra large but this organizer works in all of them.&lt;br /&gt;this is a great value(very afordable)and a good quality product,I will be buying more organizers as gifts for my girlfriends with large handbags.I highly recomend this seller, shipping was extremly fast and hassle free!</li>
    <li> Great item- seems well made and has proved to be very functional; I love that it is reversable! I bought two- one for purses and the other for my car console (perfect fit in my Explorer, wouldn&#x27;t fit in my husbands Elantra). Shipping was quick, though they initially only sent me one of the two, but they had a super quick response and ended up sending out an extra for the trouble. I love sellers I can count on (even if they don&#x27;t send me free stuff!), so I am very happy.</li>
    <li> This makes it much easier to change pocketbooks, has lots of pockets and is nice and stiff/sturdy. May buy a few more... I would prefer if it were a bit longer, but maybe will buy a smaller one and use one medium and one small... A bit pricey with shipping but haven&#x27;t found in stores. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Excelent purchase.  Now I can keep everything organized in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipment, very good service.  You can buy it with closed eyes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this organizer because I bought a new purse with few pockets.  I love it!  I can find things without having to dump my purse out and it fits my purse really well.  The pockets are well sized and they don&#x27;t gap so things stay in them even if my purse gets tipped over.  I would definitely recommend this organizer.</li>
    <li> i thought it was bigger but no matter the size it works perfectly to change my purses without any mess</li>
    <li> I finally arrived at the breaking point of digging through my purse trying to find what I need. I ordered the Lexie organizer because I had seen a similar product on TV.  I am SO happy with my purchase I am buying a second one for my best friend.  I know exactly where everything is now!  I just reach in my purse and grab it....no more searching!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item.  I cut the handles off because they kept getting in my way.  Works great and love the gold color</li>
    <li> My wife was always complaining how whatever she put in her purse was so hard to find.  I suggested an organizer but she was not interested.  I finally bought this organizer myself for the sake of peace and quite.  She loves it!!  Enough said.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted. It transfers from purse to purse easily. I can fit everything I usually carry in it.</li>
    <li> This holds quite a bit of stuff, &amp; makes quick swap outs a breeze. The quality of material is not bad for the price &amp; has held up pretty well.  I have not had to run it through the washer yet so I don&#x27;t know how it would hold up to that.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My only problem is a place for my keys. I see in this picture you&#x27;re posting that there seems to be a place for the keys. I&#x27;ll have to check mine out again. Maybe I overlooked it.</li>
    <li> I purchased a hobo bag a few weeks ago and although I like it, I was a little stressed out about the disorganization and trouble finding anything in it&#x27;s black abyss of an interior. I ordered an insert from another company without realizing it was coming from China. The estimated delivery was two months out! No way could I wait that long! I ordered this one (making sure it was shipping from the US) and it came very quickly! The organizer is perfect for my purse. It holds everything I have in its own pocket, including my point and shoot camera that I take everywhere with me. I love it!</li>
    <li> definitely keep myy purse organized, and easy to change to other bags...</li>
    <li> I guess I don&#x27;t have the right outer purse for this to work for me.  I bought it and haven&#x27;t used it once.</li>
    <li> This tote has many department but it is too small. It does not have enough support to stand upright. I don&#x27;t like it. it is not big enough, The material is great, just too small</li>
    <li> I love it! It was everything I hoped it would be easy to move from purse to purse and allowed versitility.</li>
    <li> Great bag organizer, a bit smaller than I expected but works for me. I love the fact that it&#x27;s reversible in case you want the pockets on the inside.</li>
    <li> Great for my Alexander Wang Small Emile bag. Helps me keep everything in it&#x27;s place.</li>
    <li> Had to buy another because I literally wore it out!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tough on these organizers so I&#x27;m not tough on my high-end handbags.  They work well if you&#x27;re like me and you switch bags often, especially at the last minute!</li>
    <li> Purchased a bag and absolutely loved it but kept losing stuff in the bottom and it was disorganized. This fit perfectly and keeps everything in place.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and my mom loves it.</li>
    <li> Initially I rated this a 5 star for the price as it appeared to be made of decent construction, item arrived quickly and well packaged. I bought this to help organize and keep my large Coach purse (13L X 11H X 4W) clean. It fits perfectly, with a little room to spare. I love that it makes switching purses quick and easy. I was showing it off to my mom and she liked it so much I ended up buying a second one for her. It should go without saying but read the dimensions to make sure it will work for the size of your purse. It is now 5/2014 and the exterior has held up pretty well (mine is dirty and needs to be washed but I&#x27;m afraid it will become snagged and/or fall apart). The satiny handles have frayed and the interior lining has started to fall apart which I feel is unusual since it just sits inside my purse. If I had to guess I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve moved it from one purse to another a little over a dozen times give or take. Essentially the same thing happened to the one I bought my mom but hers deteriorated even faster than mine. I think they would have lasted longer if it was made of better materials, like a canvas type material or ripstop nylon. For the price, size, and type of materials used it&#x27;s not a bad deal. I&#x27;m still using mine for now but I&#x27;m on the lookout for a more durable replacement.</li>
    <li> great product!! super convenient for different purse sizes! always found it hard to find things in my bag, now it&#x27;s easy and organized. both me and my mom are enjoying it! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  First of all, you can pick the size you need for the handbag you have.  Also, you can choose the&lt;br /&gt;fabric you like.  And then, the product itself makes it so convenient to fit everything you need in your bag and then also&lt;br /&gt;to switch it from one bag to the next simply by pulling it up and out by the handles and placing it in your new bag.  So easy!&lt;br /&gt;And then you can fit so much more in your bag and keep it organized so you&#x27;re able to find things when you need them quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to every lady that carries a handbag!</li>
    <li> I was so sick of all my stuff floating around in the bottom of my purse, so I bought this organizer. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but I love it! The only issue I had with it is that is has an oily industrial smell which has dissipated over 4-5 days.</li>
    <li> When my olf Relic cross-body purse had given me its all and I needed to replace it, I could not find one with similar pockets that would suit my needs.  Instead I found an adorable owl cross-body purse that had little organization, but otherwise would work for me.  This little organizer holds everything I needed to sort out right within easy reach (no fumbling around for stuff for me!): check book, comb, gum, glass case for prescription sunglasses, wallet, coupon file, cosmetic bag, little bag with tampons etc, tissues and a variety of writing utensils.  And it fits perfectly in the bottom of my new owl purse  making it even more useful than the Relic one I had loved :)  What&#x27;s even better is that this can be transitioned to a new purse if I desire and I will not lose my wonderful organization!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t quite what I was looking for, but it works fine.</li>
    <li> This organizer has been the answer to many needs to organize my purse.  Love that it is portable from purse to purse and works in medium to large bags.  Added bonus, my husband rarely complains about the contents of my purse since I began using this.  :)</li>
    <li> I just wish it was about 2 inches longer, it&#x27;s just a bit small but workable, keeps my purse very organized.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very light weight so it doesn&#x27;t add too much weight to my purse.  Many pockets allow me to organize things easily.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. It makes it super easy to organize things the quality was excellent and the price was great.</li>
    <li> was a whole lot smaller than it looks...didn&#x27;t hold hardly anything</li>
    <li> The smell of this product literally made my eyes water.  In my opinion this can&#x27;t be safe to touch or breath.  I am waiting to hear back from seller as to whether or not I can return it.  I find that strange, as well.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect product for those of us that like to transfer purses/handbags frequently.  It makes transferring effortless and the handles and side pockets are perfect.  The side compartments are a great added touch and makes finding items and digging in your bag easier.  I use this in my medium size tote purses and it fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this purchase. The bag is a yellowish beige color. It is not gold at all.</li>
    <li> It is a beautful gold and very sturdy but make sure you put your stuff in it and THEN put it in your purse. Otherwise you are just sticking things into holes and not really getting organized. It is great tho for organization. I have a small bag and I need every inch of space I have and this clearly helps that. It is and adorable gold color and the handles are small so they can be tucked into the sides. All in all a great experience</li>
    <li> Finally my girlfriend does not spend ten minutes trying to find her keys or her phone. The fabric seems durable, everything they promise.</li>
    <li> This organizer is sturdy enough to hold up in my bag but small enough to not have to stuff it in. I love the handles. I can take it out of one bag and put it in to my other with no problem. The only down side is the strong plastic smell when you first take it out of the plastic packaging. I put mine out in the garage for several days to let the fresh air get rid of the smell. For the price it is something I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected...</li>
    <li> I love my new organizer.  It has made a major difference in transferring items from one purse to another.  It is not longer a chore...I just lift the organizer and insert into a different purse.  That&#x27;s it.  Wish I had ordered this a long time agao.</li>
    <li> I like that it has handles; I was trying to find one w/ handles that was big enough and in a good color. I thought that this was more of a tannish gold, but it&#x27;s actually a rather light gold, so I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to show dirt easily. It does seem a bit small, but it&#x27;s the same size as described.</li>
    <li> Ummmm..........I thought this organizer was meant for LARGE purses??? This thing is so small and doesn&#x27;t hold a thing!!!!! I am returning it and getting a refund. Ridiculous</li>
    <li> I have several purses that don&#x27;t have a lot of compartments, so this is just what I needed. It is small, but it fits my purses just fine.</li>
    <li> Ok for the price but everything falls out into your purse</li>
    <li> love this organizer. check your dimensions before buying. super perfect !!!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to downsize my purse for what seems like forever.  The ones with enough pockets are too big.  The smaller ones don&#x27;t have enough pockets, if any.  Yes, I&#x27;m an organizational freak.  A place for everything, and everything in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This organizer is the perfect size for my favorite small purse.  It is flexible, too.  My purse is long and narrow.  You can turn this to make it what ever shape you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> To soft, handles get in the way inside of the purse.  I am waiting for an alternate item to arrive to try out instead of this one.  I will probably not return it but pass it on to a girlfriend that might be able to use it better.</li>
    <li> Love it  in my purse.. not only for make-up...So i already order me another and already got 2 and plus bigger size for bigger pocketbook.. This organizer is very handy.- wont go without one.</li>
    <li> Keeps my purse organizes and makes it easier to change purses. Just what I was looking for. I even bought 4 more to give as a \\&quot;my favorite things\\&quot; gift for friends.</li>
    <li> The quality is fine for the price but I found it too small for my large purse (this was my mistake).  Next time I will order a larger size.</li>
    <li> Well made.  Should have considered the size more in my choice.  It is a little small for my bags.  It does keep everything together.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I wish it was bigger (longer)  It is sturdy, has many pockets and works well in a smaller handbag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t use a very large bag.  If you do you will need two of these little bags.</li>
    <li> I look like I&#x27;m a organized person!!! Lol handy for quick purse change!!! I have showed tons of people all who want one.</li>
    <li> hard to get the organizer in and out of my purse I own  , may be all right in another bag but it does organize your things  just hard to get to since it is kind of large for my purse</li>
    <li> I love this item! It makes switching your purse so so easy! Also makes a great gift for the ladies or photographers in your life!</li>
    <li> I like this organizer. It holds a great deal of my belongings and it is very convenient to change handbags.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. Although the dimensions are listed, the picture makes the bag look MUCH larger than the reality.  I paid way too much for an item that might be found at a dollar, or similar discount, store.  It has that cheap, made in a foreign country odor.  Please heed my warning... buyer beware!!! I would not recommend this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> Nice space but much smaller than I expected.  Works great for a little purse but not for the large purses I usually carry.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea.  It is well made.  Pockets on the outside for larger purses.  Flip it inside out so the pockets are in the inside for smaller purses.  Finally organized.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to just dumping out my purse every time I need something. I wish they made a longer one because I have big purses!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t understand why some reviewers thought the item was small.  It measures exactly as advertised.  I was going to cut the handles off, but discovered they are very handy.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love pockets in my purse, and this provided a lot!  However, they were not as versitile as I had hoped, and I found it difficult to pull things out due to how tight some of them were even with small items in them</li>
    <li> Good for who need to organize a small purse. Good product quality and looks good. Easy to change from one to another purse.</li>
    <li> Very small not what I thought but that was my fault :) Very fast shipping. Is very cute :)</li>
    <li> Just what I needed when switching from one purse to the next. Wish I learned of this product sooner. Now time for a larger one for my totes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of women that carry a lot in my hand bag, i often go through a lot to find anything in it. Finally, this essential Lexie Organizer inset made my life easier. I love it, when changing hand bag, (which i do every other day)i just grab my organizer inset and transfer everything into the different bag and go.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will difinetly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So happy I purchased. Love it! Keeps everything organized &amp; love that it is not so big - it&#x27;s the perfect size for most of my bags.  I do not use giant bags, but they are big enough to where things do not stay in order. And they&#x27;e also not big enough to where other organizers would fit in them well. This little baby fits the bill perfectly! I cut the handles off immediately as they just get in the way. It is perfect for the person that doesn&#x27;t tote around tons of stuff but the few items she does carry around (small lotion,travel tissues, small glass case, lipsticks, phone, etc.) she likes to keep in order and easy to find. For the price well worth trying!</li>
    <li> If you are like me and like to carry larger hand bags this size is not for you. Overall it is still a good organzier when carrying smaller handbags</li>
    <li> Excellent purse organzer,,,Just hoping to find one a little bigger now,,,Great quality, perfect for organizing all my purse stuff! I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought but it works perfectly for any tote bag, shoulder bag or small purse with no insert or pockets. You can just lift it out of one purse and set it in another easily. It is reversible for any small handbag but large enough to fit all of your necessary items.</li>
