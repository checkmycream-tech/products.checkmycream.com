      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>My skin looks so much better under make-up.</li>
      <li>it contains  Sodium Hyaluronate which is not as potent as H.A.</li>

      <li>my skin has never felt or looked better.  </li>
      <li>Makes my skin smooth, but at 76 I didn&#x27;t expect a face lift from it!</li>

      <li>SUPER FAST DELIVERY!!!</li>
      <li>In contrast to the rave reviews by others,  I also did not find the moisturizing quality any better than a cheaper hyaluronic acid serum  (Oz naturals) although do appreciate that their products, this one included, are largely fragrance-free.</li>
      <li>Having not used it for a full month yet, I hesitate to review the product.  </li>
      <li>I put it on right out of the shower, and suddenly my face is smoother and the moisturizer I put on top of it</li>
      <li>This is the first PTR product that cased that reaction.  </li>
      <li>Two weeks after it looked 50% better (morning and evening daily applications).</li>
      <li>I thought it was supposed to be a powerful moisturizing, but it&#x27;s very superficial.</li>
      <li>works ten times better.</li>
      <li>(in fact, my acne may actually be some improved because skin is more balanced).</li>
      <li>I love it, this is the second purchased.</li>
      <li>My skin is looking pretty hydrated.</li>
      <li>I still use my regular moisturizer over top of this.</li>
      <li>About one month later, my skin looked much better.</li>
      <li>I purchased this originally from a well-known cosmetic store and pain nearly $50.</li>
      <li>(I would give it five stars if it were), but it works better than anything I have ever found on my forty-something dry skin.</li>
      <li>When you need extra moisture, this is a fabulous product.</li>
      <li>This product has really changed my skin.</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: you can go through it freakishly fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but not worth the price.</li>
      <li>Its main ingredient, I&#x27;m talking 75% of the formula</li>
      <li>This is not a lotion, but actually works better at moisturizing if used regularly (in my opinion).</li>
      <li>Only need to press it once and it can apply on my whole face, make your face feel moisture immediately!</li>
      <li>I add one pump of this miracle serum to my facial moisturizer every morning, and for 40, my wrinkle situation is looking pretty under control.</li>
      <li>I am 67 years old and I have used dozens of different moisturizers, both priced lower and higher than this one.</li>
      <li>My daughter, who is 39 years old loves it too.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product even if you have to spend your total skin care budget for it.</li>
      <li>My skin was dry with large peeling areas all over my forehead, chin, and nose.</li>
      <li>This product appears to be exactly the same (same bottle, label, same quality).</li>
      <li>The percentage of hyaluronic acid must be much higher than other serums with this ingredient.</li>
      <li>Smooth texture, but a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>This moisturizer seems to work well to lock in my regular (Boots sensitive) moisturizer.</li>
      <li>have normal to dry skin.</li>
      <li>Wow, I can hardly get this from the bottle to my face, it soaks into my skin so fast.</li>

    <li> good for the alergic skin.</li>
    <li> Hard to tell  on the skin my mother dont see any diffrent  but parts of her face skin falling  so that  &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;  doing some thing to the face.... i think  i will update my review in few weeks.  Sorry for my english</li>
    <li> This stuff is quite expensive (I would give it five stars if it were), but it works better than anything I have ever found on my forty-something dry skin. I put it on right out of the shower, and suddenly my face is smoother and the moisturizer I put on top of it works ten times better. I looked it up: hyaluronic acid puts moisture in your cells, which makes sense to me. I do wish this were cheaper, but you use very small amounts and the bottle lasts a long time. I swear by it.</li>
    <li> Quite disappointed with the product. I thought it was supposed to be a powerful moisturizing, but it&#x27;s very superficial. I bought it because I need a good one to go through the winter, but I&#x27;ll certainly have to get something else. Maybe it will work well during summer ...</li>
    <li> This moisturizer seems to work well to lock in my regular (Boots sensitive) moisturizer. For me, I can&#x27;t just use it on it&#x27;s own - it&#x27;s not enough moisture for me. I have oily to combo skin. I do like it as a &#x27;seal&#x27; for moisturizer, but it can&#x27;t stand on it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> Skin looks fresh all the while!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to see or feel any difference after 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my skin the next day.  I&#x27;m sold on this product and don&#x27;t plan to be without it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is amazing. I&#x27;m 27 and now starting to take care of my skin (always too lazy before) and this gives me the perfect amount of moisture that it makes my skin feel so smooth and healthy and makes me makeup also look &amp; hold better!</li>
    <li> Smooth texture, but a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried it while traveling on an airplane yet, will let you know</li>
    <li> Makes your skin look like glass-it&#x27;s a great product! Also makes your skin feel taut and youthful and gives it a nice appearance.</li>
    <li> Nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: you can go through it freakishly fast.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It gives you a lot of hydration without the greasy feeling that some lotions can leave.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great service.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smooth, but at 76 I didn&#x27;t expect a face lift from it!</li>
    <li> I am 67 years old and I have used dozens of different moisturizers, both priced lower and higher than this one. Nothing touches this one. It absorbs quickly and you get great results right away.  It protects your skin as well and makes a great base for your primer. It is a morning product but I don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t use it at night. My daughter, who is 39 years old loves it too. I highly recommend this product even if you have to spend your total skin care budget for it.</li>
    <li> It hydrates my skin. I also use it on my hands. The product is great. even though, I like the product I wish that bottles would sealed.</li>
    <li> Wow, I can hardly get this from the bottle to my face, it soaks into my skin so fast. When you need extra moisture, this is a fabulous product. The percentage of hyaluronic acid must be much higher than other serums with this ingredient.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased!  Combined with their body lotion my skin has never felt or looked better.  I&#x27;m definitely a Peter Thomas Roth fan.</li>
    <li> This is lightweight, absorbs easily, non- greasy, and when used under moisturizer faithfully, it will improve your hydration.  Also perfect after peels, microdermabrasion etc.  It does not sting, and feels soot hing after these type of treatments.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  Its main ingredient, I&#x27;m talking 75% of the formula is the hot hyaluronic acid that the skin care and beauty industry is going crazy over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal to dry skin.</li>
    <li> So far so good on this. It absorbs into the skin well. I still use my regular moisturizer over top of this. My skin is looking pretty hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love it, this is the second purchased.</li>
    <li> This product has changed my skin!!! It&#x27;s a great moisturizing serum I use after I moisturize so it locks in the moisture all day long!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Can get on Amazon for much less than retail stores.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE.  SUPER FAST DELIVERY!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this originally from a well-known cosmetic store and pain nearly $50. I loved the product but wanted to find it at a better price. This product appears to be exactly the same (same bottle, label, same quality). It goes on like a serum. It doesn&#x27;t feel like an &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; moisturizer because it&#x27;s so lightweight but it has done wonders for my chronically dry, flaky skin. My skin looks so much better under make-up. I also struggle with acne and this did not cause any breakouts (in fact, my acne may actually be some improved because skin is more balanced). I think some reviewers were expecting more of a lotion feel. This is not a lotion, but actually works better at moisturizing if used regularly (in my opinion).</li>
    <li> Yes, everything that&#x27;s listed on the description for this product is backed up by this little bottle. I was AMAZED by the effectiveness of this serum. My skin was dry with large peeling areas all over my forehead, chin, and nose. Two weeks after it looked 50% better (morning and evening daily applications). About one month later, my skin looked much better. Miracle in the bottle here.</li>
    <li> This product has really changed my skin. My face does not have that tight or dry feeling after wearing this. It woks well with my moisturizer. Never sticky or heavy feeling.</li>
    <li> Having not used it for a full month yet, I hesitate to review the product.  I do like the way it makes my skin feel and I believe my skin is showing improvement, but I will need proof to judge.  It was well recommended, which is why I decided to invest in two bottles to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor delivered as promised and on time.</li>
    <li> Silky finish after using strongly recommend for any skin types</li>
    <li> I am a international student here, and the weather here is too dry for me. I&#x27;ve been looking for something can make my face look smooth in the morning. And I found it!!!!!!!!! This is it!!!!!! I love it!!!!!!!!!! Only need to press it once and it can apply on my whole face, make your face feel moisture immediately!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not worth the price.</li>
    <li> After doing research I found out this doesn&#x27;t contain hyacluronic acid it contains  Sodium Hyaluronate which is not as potent as H.A.</li>
    <li> I never break out unless it is an allergic reaction.  DK which ingredient caused the breakout, but I tried several times over four months to use this product and each time I broke out.  This is the first PTR product that cased that reaction.  In contrast to the rave reviews by others,  I also did not find the moisturizing quality any better than a cheaper hyaluronic acid serum  (Oz naturals) although do appreciate that their products, this one included, are largely fragrance-free.</li>
    <li> it is about to expired.the bacth number shows it prducted in 2012,i will not recommond to buy it from this sel</li>
    <li> I add one pump of this miracle serum to my facial moisturizer every morning, and for 40, my wrinkle situation is looking pretty under control. It instantly puffs small lines around the eyes and makes my face dewy all day. I love it! I recommend it to anyone who will listen to me! (including the teller at the bank drive through who sees me daily and says I don&#x27;t look 40!)</li>
    <li> You can feel The difference</li>
