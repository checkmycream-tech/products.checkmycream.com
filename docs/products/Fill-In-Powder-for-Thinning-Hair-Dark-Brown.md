      <li>Works well, good price, just wish they made more color choices, like brown/gray, or salt and pepper.</li>

      <li>Washes out easily and blends amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>Used to be able to buy this at CVS.  </li>
      <li>On line is also a better buy than the stores.</li>
      <li>The Joan Rivers product is darker and I do like that better</li>
      <li>I like this much better than the marker or spray types that made my hair sticky and cost a lot more.</li>
      <li>Works great and much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I did.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Because it takes more, it is a longer process, so it that is the reason for a lower rating.</li>
      <li>Though I do like it better than the spray.</li>
      <li>so it looks like you have more hair.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I think for the size of the product for the price derm match is a better deal</li>
      <li>Joan rivers product is better</li>
      <li>Be sure to order this one.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I would give this product a five star rating if the applicator was a sponge, or something that covered better.  </li>
      <li>Decided to pay more for the Joan Rivers product, which I feel is a better product</li>
      <li>Glad i tried this before the pricier brand.  </li>
      <li>WORKS LIKE MAGIC.</li>
      <li>Just ok for covering gray hair.</li>
      <li>Just received and love it already.  </li>
      <li>COULD NOT BE MORE HAPPIER.</li>
      <li>Otherwise I love it.</li>
      <li>More goes on my hair rather than the powder that you shake on your hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is pretty good.....</li>
      <li>it just couldn&#x27;t even begin to help her, so I really can&#x27;t give this product a fair rating.</li>
      <li>The color looks funny in my bathroom mirror but it is fine in bright light.</li>
      <li>IT WAS EASY AND DID NOT FLAKE OR SMUDGE AND COVERS</li>
      <li>Easy peasy.  </li>
      <li>Very quick deliver.</li>
      <li>the applicator brush does tend to lose its bristles fairly easy, so i may buy another one.</li>
      <li>Went on easily and covered well and stayed put until I shampooed it out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have grey hair, but this dark brown blends in well and hides thinning places well. Glad i tried this before the pricier brand.  I have to agree with others that the brush loses hair like it just had chemo treatment.  I decided to put some drops of fray check (used for fabrics) at the base of the brush hairs and keep the brush upright while it dried.  It worked.</li>
    <li> This fill-in powder for thinning hair has exceeded my hopes and expectations.  Not noticeable after application.  Makes hair look fuller.  I love it.</li>
    <li> works very well. The dark brown is not too dark ...looks better on my hair than the other brand I use Good price, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long in the compact as the other one I use.  I also agree with others that the brush is almost useless. I have purchased the expensive Joan Rivers product before I found this one and thankfully I kept the brushes from that. The Joan Rivers product is darker and I do like that better but the price is just too high. This Fiske industries product is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Very good product! It makes a big difference in the way my hair looks. I&#x27;ve already ordered some more! Merchant shipped very quickly!</li>
    <li> Not exactly  the color I expected.</li>
    <li> THIS FILL IN POWDER IS THE BEST. IT WAS EASY AND DID NOT FLAKE OR SMUDGE AND COVERS EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL. THANK GOODNESS FOR THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I really needed it in a lighter brown, more like dark blond. If you get it in that color, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time now, and it is probably the best.  More goes on my hair rather than the powder that you shake on your hair</li>
    <li> Mu husband loves this product.  It works wonderfully to hide his thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Very quick deliver. This product is easy to dirty your hands and fingers.</li>
    <li> Received all three boxes with powder intact. It matches perfectly and stays on until I wash my hair. It covers very well.  Sent some to my sister, too. This is about the third time I ordered from this company. They&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> powder fell all over the place</li>
    <li> Best powder to cover balding or gray areas without making you look like a freak.  The color stays in much better than a lot of other products.</li>
    <li> Looks grey, not dark brown.</li>
    <li> Really covers those spots with no or skimpy hair&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and stays put until next hair washing&lt;br /&gt;One container lasts me over 2 months so this is a great value.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I expected, does not cover the hair near the scalp, nor stay on as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I thinning hair and bald patches... sucks, i know.... But i until i can find a product to help my hair grow back i have been using this fill in powder and i have to say it makes styling my hair so much easier because i don&#x27;t have to worry about my scalp showing through. Its great!</li>
    <li> I like products that are swear proof as in the description here: \\&quot;Rain proof &amp; swear proof. . .won&#x27;t run, sweat or rub off. Washes out only when hair is shampooed normally\\&quot;. I like that it&#x27;s rain proof, but swear proof??!! I do a lot of swearing and I&#x27;m not sure this product will hold up to that. I&#x27;ll try it on my friend and see if I can swear it off once it&#x27;s applied.</li>
    <li> Works well, good price, just wish they made more color choices, like brown/gray, or salt and pepper.</li>
    <li> This purchase was absolutely great.  The product is what I was looking for, came quickly and I could hardly believe that shipping was free on such a small item.  I will order this again, as well as look at other items offered by this seller.</li>
    <li> poor coverage. Looked so powdery and dull. Used once, never again.</li>
    <li> I like the product because it does the job and less expensive than the last product I was using.What I don&#x27;t like  is&lt;br /&gt;that the shipping cost is far too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend to my friends if the shipping is less expensive.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have good coverage and takes a lot of work and powder.  I bought this based on the reviews that claimed it was better than Great Hair.  It just doesn&#x27;t compare.  I am disappointed.  I&#x27;m seriously thinking of paying the extra money for Joan Rivers&#x27; brand.</li>
    <li> The color is too light for my hair, and each time I would run my hands through my hair, the powder gets to my hand. the powder barely provide any coverage.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a friend who has had such severe hair loss that  it just couldn&#x27;t even begin to help her, so I really can&#x27;t give this product a fair rating.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and a great price!  It works very well for covering gray roots and using in between coloring your hair.</li>
    <li> Recommended seller! Seems to be a good product. A plus for containing Procapil and that it doesn&#x27;t clog the pores like some other similar products do. A question mark for how to applie it; a wet brush makes it sticky, dry brush makes it too powdery.</li>
    <li> It works like it&#x27;s supposed to; no problem, it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t like having to put powder in my hair. Though I do like it better than the spray.</li>
    <li> They have raised the bottom of the compact so you get less product!  Just another ripoff!!</li>
    <li> We are thankful that you had this item available.  it works great for my needs and is so simple to use.  It last a very long time, but I will order again when needed.  Aloha - Mireya</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years. Very happy with this as I have a thinning and receding hairline. No one can tell ai am using this. Be sure to order this one. There is a copy out there without Procapil. This caked powder is the best as it doesn&#x27;t powder up when using and stays in place until washing. I&#x27;ve tried Adrienne Arpel&#x27;s and Joan River&#x27;s version. This is the best by far and the least expensive. On line is also a better buy than the stores. Order from Amazon, of course! My hair is lighte, a mahogany cherry,  but I use dark brown, not medium brown to cover.</li>
    <li> Does what is says it will.  It&#x27;s a little awkward to apply at first but it covers well.</li>
    <li> Brush sheds a lot. But it does what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> It truly does what it says it will do.  Masks the fact that there is less hair coming in by covering the scalp, I recommend this product to anyone having this problem,</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It works great!  I would definitely recommend this item to anyone with very thin hair.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED TO FILL IN THE THINNING AREAS AROUND THE FACE AND IT APPEARS TO BE WORKING WELL FOR ME</li>
    <li> I love the fill in powder, it certainly does the job.  However, the brush sheds and comes off in my hair making it look like lint in my hair.  Otherwise I love it.</li>
    <li> It hardly cover my thinning hair not enough coverage and very hard to apply</li>
    <li> I have black/brown hair and this works great for my eyebrows. Not too black, not too light brown, just the perfect color and it never smudges.</li>
    <li> It works very well but is very messy.  I am definitely getting it again.  It makes a huge difference in the look of my hair.  My boss asked what I was doing!</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as Joan Rivers. But,to me it goes on easier. I don&#x27;t use this in the summer. The color doesn&#x27;t stay where it is suppose to. It kinda melts. In the cooler weather it is great. I have medium brown hair and use the brown to black and it is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using Joan Rivers powder cover for hair loss from a radiation treatment and it worked great.  Because of economics I decided to switch brands.  What a mistake! No matter how hard I tried it didn&#x27;t cover.  I not only bought one but two of these mistakes.  Do not recommend.  Will never order again.  Am going back to Joan Rivers Brand.</li>
    <li> I received the Fill In Powder, however I thought the powder would be compacted down.  I had to put the loose powder in another container so it would no fly around, or perhaps lose it upon opening the container.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Powder crumbles and the brush sucks.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the size of the product, I expected it to be larger.  Whether it worked well or not I couldn&#x27;t speak to because the brush provided started rapidly shedding hairs as soon as I lifted it from the package.  I think for the size of the product for the price derm match is a better deal and I know it works.</li>
    <li> Covered my bold spots pretty well, looks very natural, you have to slowly apply, it&#x27;s good for the price. My hair is growing back now so I use it less. I use it mainly when I go out and want to look a little bit better. Doesn&#x27;t run down your face when you sweat. Decent product.</li>
    <li> Hi,  I like your product with the exception that if one carries it around, there is a possibility that it might crumble into many little pieces,  and &amp;#34;.....all the king&#x27;s horses and all the king&#x27;s men, could not put it back together again.&amp;#34;  That is what happened to mine.  Could you possibly send a replacement?</li>
    <li> Worked really well. Looked natural</li>
    <li> I just turned 50 this year. My dark brown hair has always had bits of grey, especially near the temples (why couldn&#x27;t it be in the back of the neck?!) and along the hair line. The routine has been to color every 6 weeks with my hair dresser, concentrating on the roots. In between I would get a $6 touch-up from the store. Seems now I&#x27;m having to do the touch-ups a lot sooner than every 3 weeks. So, not wanting to constantly color the hair and potentially cause damage, I looked into fill in powder. This was rated the best as far as I could tell and it has been as reviewers claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is not overly obvious yet covers very well. I like that it&#x27;s a powder and goes on in a more subtle way versus a color stick, which I&#x27;ve tried in the past and is way too clumpy and obvious. If reviewers had issue with the color/coverage, it would seem to me they have to try different colors--maybe I just got lucky with my color. This provided me the perfect solution to my problem and I would highly recommend this brand, this color.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product to cover up graying hair. Stays in hair until hair is washed.  Great product if you are letting your dyed hair grow out and you want to blend the old color with the grey to make that line of demarcation less noticeable!</li>
    <li> The powder did not go on easily &amp; didn&#x27;t have staying power,also there was very small quantity of powder in the container. I like the fact that it contains procopil ,so they should work on fixing the rest in order to make it a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other fill-in powders and they spread easier than this one. The color is great, the brush is great. It does last and stay put, as described.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t cover real well, I had to keep reapplying to get more coverage.i will continue to use it as I bought it, but I have had better and more easily to apply products</li>
    <li> Works great and much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work very well, but my package arrived with the powder itself broken up and about half of it had leaked out, making a very big mess and losing much of what I&#x27;d paid for. So that was quite disappointing. The package was certainly padded well enough, so I don&#x27;t know what happened.</li>
    <li> Its my third order of this powder works great.</li>
    <li> Love it. Have been looking for something that would cover a burn scar in my head. This is perfect!!!! I will order this product on a regular bases.</li>
    <li> Messy and the brush that comes with it sheds like crazy, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> This product is for &amp;#34;grey hair coverage&amp;#34; not for thinning hair .</li>
    <li> i buy this  all the time ,  its  a  good product...! &amp;  easy to use...!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product has more control and less mess than the hair fibers but doesn&#x27;t cover the thin spots as well, plus the darkest color is not dark enough if you have black hair.  It does seem to add body to thin hair and I still use it for additional fill in right along the hairline.</li>
    <li> Covers beautifully.  This was the right color for me.  I like that I can put it on and it stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over a year now.  I&#x27;ve been very conscious with my thinning hair, i don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s hereditary, or comes with age.  But, this product is a lifesaver, I bring this with me wherever I go.</li>
    <li> love this!!! really helps!</li>
    <li> I found it hard to use as it arrived broken and the powder was a pain to put back in the container.</li>
    <li> The powder is great but the brush loses a lot of fine hairs. It is cheaper though than similar products by $30 so is worth just buying a better brush.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY THIRD PURCHASE OF FILLIN POWDER FOR THINNING HAIR AND I LOVE IT. WORKS LIKE MAGIC. COULD NOT BE MORE HAPPIER.</li>
    <li> Just received and love it already.  It works and I recommend to people with thinning hair.  Does make one feel better too!</li>
    <li> This fills in the thin spots ok, but it makes the scalp itch a lot. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried many different products and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  It covers the thinning area and really fills it in to look fuller.  It also lasts until the next shampoo and doesn&#x27;t leave residual marks on clothes or pillows etc.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied and highly recommend it to everyone who has this problem.</li>
    <li> I bought liquid and crayon type to cover roots both waste of money because they get hair dirty and heavy and do not over gray...so I decided to try poder. I very happay, it really works and don´t make my hair heavier.</li>
    <li> Arrived in timely fashion.  Have only used it once and color (dark brown) matched my hair. A bit disappointed that some powder came off on my hands when I straightened my hair a hour or so later.</li>
    <li> I order this product first, not impressed. Decided to pay more for the Joan Rivers product, which I feel is a better product</li>
    <li> use it every day and night works well for me being in the pubric</li>
    <li> I would give this product a five star rating if the applicator was a sponge, or something that covered better.  The little brush that comes with it barely does a touch up, and if you are covering any area at all, the brush is way too small.  The product is really good though, just use a bigger applicator.</li>
    <li> I found this particular product at a Ross store and thought I would find it and I loved it!! Of course I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anywhere, so I decided to try Amazon.com, and sure enough I found it! And for the price, I definitely couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I strongly recommend this product to anyone dealing w/thinning or hair loss!</li>
    <li> This product appears nearly gray compared to my natural hair which is dark brown.  I much prefer Joan River&#x27;s brand, but was looking for a less expensive choice.</li>
    <li> I like it but wish they had a few different colors, like dark brown/gray...........then it would be a much better product.</li>
    <li> so far, so good. it does seem to blend well and helps with greys and thinning areas. the applicator brush does tend to lose its bristles fairly easy, so i may buy another one.</li>
    <li> Will not buy again.  Didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
    <li> Did the job but flakes all over, very messy because it flakes as u r coming your hair.  Joan rivers product is better</li>
    <li> Dark brown is brown.  Not dark brown as any mens hair coloring code would be.  It does not match.  Its much lighter.  Other than that is jumps to greys and skin.  Amazing otherwise.  It seems to be sweat resistant and touch resistant meaning it never blurred, ran or transferred to my hands.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was okay when I first got it, but that I just needed to learn how to use it.  I&#x27;ve since purchased other products I like much better and that don&#x27;t get everywhere!  I dropped the compact from my hand to the counter, not a big fall, and there was just powder evvvvverywhere.  The unit didn&#x27;t technically break, but the powder that already separated and got loose all over everything was even more broken up now.  If you travel with it put it in a ziplock even if you don&#x27;t think you need to!</li>
    <li> When my husband asked me if I was doing my hair differently I realized he&#x27;d finally noticed that my hair was thinning on the top of my head. Nothing I could do could hide the fact until I tried this fill in powder for thinning hair. The powder comes in a small container like one you would expect to contain blush. The powder is a dark brown color and there is a brush with short bristles to apply it. All you do is style your hair normally and then brush on the powder in the most obvious thinning areas. It works like a charm. What it really does is darken the scalp so it looks like you have more hair. This powder will also cover gray hair - I tried it. While I normally color my hair this powder is nice for touch ups between coloring. I find it works especially well at the temples where you can see the gray hair appearing. I am very happy with this product and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I like this much better than the marker or spray types that made my hair sticky and cost a lot more.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend, it was too chalky.</li>
    <li> Great for gray coverage. Went on easily and covered well and stayed put until I shampooed it out. I also bought it for the fill in capabilities, which I found wanting.  If that is what you want, this may not be for you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with my Amazon purchases.  It is such an easy and convenient way to shop.</li>
    <li> My hair started falling out worse.</li>
    <li> love it!!!!! works great!!!!!</li>
    <li> Did not really like the product. The color did not match my hair and did not provide the coverage I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and fast as well. Covers very thoroughly. Tougher to shampoo off than the leading brand, but 2 washings do the trick. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Have a hard time to get in to blend in smoothly, lose a lot of the powder tryging to get it blended</li>
    <li> This product has really made a difference for me. It works really well and I have recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> Consider dark brown to be the color the box.  It doesn&#x27;t match my hair color but still does well to cover that little tiny bald spot.  I&#x27;m indian and my hair is dark brown to black.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> My mother has suffered with extreme thinning on the top of her head for the last few years. Like any woman, she detests it &amp; is very self conscious about it. She&#x27;s done everything to cover it up, mainly with styling, but that never works. I ordered this for her &amp; it made such a difference in her confidence. It&#x27;s worked beautifully for her. Just the right shade for her brown hair. The powder&#x27;s a bit messy to use, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great product, that we continue to purchase. A great buy. Definitely serves it&#x27;s purpose of covering the bald scalp due to her thinning hair. Best wishes!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no wonder product.... Not by a mile. Brush is sturdy but a bit too wide. Product itself is just...meh. Won&#x27;t buy again, may try something else.</li>
    <li> The powder works okay. It does make my scalp itch. I haven&#x27;t decided if I am going to try another product like this again.</li>
    <li> I prefer this this hollywood instant hair! Works well with a more professional application brush... great product for its cost</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  I am purchasing this again as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous fill in powder and covers gray.  Washes out easily and blends amazingly well.  I highly recommend this product.  Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> The brush started shedding immediately.</li>
    <li> It is a great product, more resonably priced than at the beauty stores. Also, you get two, not just one.</li>
    <li> Does cover area but need to watch excess powder that get on forehead if do not put enough looks like you have dirt on scalp</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use this product because the color was not a match for me.  Can&#x27;t comment on anything else about it</li>
    <li> I really like this product, but be aware that you must buy a darker shade than JR, for instance, I have &#x27;blonde&#x27; from JR and it is fine for my light/medium brown hair. This brand is still a bit light even with the &#x27;dark brown&#x27; shade.</li>
    <li> This product in wonderful and looks so natural! I have recommended it to my friends. They are in the process of ordering it for themselves.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this purchase but since I really needed something for my thinning hair, I decided to try it. And I am happy to report that once I mastered how to apply the powder so it does not smudge or look like paint on my scalp, the results looks good. The trick is to apply like make-up. Apply thin coats onto the scalp as much as possible and blend, blend, blend with the brush. Of course it takes time to get the application correct, about 15-20minutes but it is worth the extra effort. I usually reapply once a week.</li>
    <li> I prefer the powder that you can just shake rather than this that needs a brush to apply. However, it works as well but hard to apply.</li>
    <li> Love the product but when I received it, the powder was completely crumbled and broken into pieces. It is a total mess. The product is great though. It works as well as I had heard.</li>
    <li> Did not work as advertised</li>
    <li> Powder works well, but the makeup breaks up easily in container (not packed hard enough?) Gets messy and product is lost in mess.</li>
    <li> For the affordable price I was pretty impressed with this product. The color in the container was slightly alarming like it might not match.  It&#x27;s a sort of  medium to dark brownish grey color not a straight up dark brown color. When I applied it blended in pretty well very easily. The product is not completely unscented (which is what made me chose this as I don&#x27;t want a perfumed product)  but the scent isn&#x27;t perfume its more slightly medicinal and does not linger or interfere. If there was a darker color I would try it but this dark brown is acceptable.</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel super dry and tangly</li>
    <li> This product gives very good coverage and stays well even when hair is gently washed.  Gave 4 stars because brush is losing bristles rapidly...have bought a brush that is better quality &amp; should last through more than a few uses.</li>
    <li> Feels like charcoal on your head, coverage is ok if you don&#x27;t have much to cover up, the brush releases little fine hairs which I guess are supposed fill in over the color. Probably won&#x27;t use it, makes my hair feel dirty, but people who observed me with it on my hair thought it was a good improvement.. I give it 3 stars for overall.</li>
    <li> Great product !  Happy to have it !  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was considering a more expensive product but decided to try this better value.  I am glad that I did.  Arrived  on time and works great.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this brand because the kind I normally use was sold out...First off, this was lighter than my brunette so I&#x27;d say use this if your hair is medium brown, not almost black...I did like how this stayed on..It doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34;...It stays put for what I do...I did not swim in this so I don&#x27;t know how that would work....This was very easy to use...I did like the brush, much better than my normal brand...The size was also smaller than my normal brand and I also pay $10.00 each....&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is pretty good.....</li>
    <li> i prefer joan river&#x27;s great hair day, but for some reason the only shade you can get from that site is the salt &#x27;n pepper.  this product works well for the price, i suppose, but it doesn&#x27;t cover or stick as well.  also, it was in a much smaller compact than i was expecting.  probably good for the price; it&#x27;s a definite &#x27;get what you pay for&#x27; kinda thing.  but it works in a pinch if you can&#x27;t find the GHD product, like me.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money......color was way off and it made the hair look dirty and artificial. I do not recomment this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. You only have to use a minimal amount to get a nice coverage. I would have given five stars if the brush that came with it didn&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> was not at all plesed</li>
    <li> It actually didn&#x27;t get to me on the date they said but they took care of it very promptly after I emailed them! I like the product for the price! I&#x27;m recommending it to my sister to use!  I have thinning hair and it covers well! The color looks funny in my bathroom mirror but it is fine in bright light. I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I like the product, but it does not do as well as a competitor.  I tried it because it was cheaper, but it requires more product than the competitor to do the same job, so it is a wash as far as value.  Because it takes more, it is a longer process, so it that is the reason for a lower rating.</li>
    <li> Covers very well.  This meets my needs</li>
    <li> Easy peasy.  Nice to cover my pink scalp under my dark hair and a lot less pricey than some advertised elsewhere on the net  and in magazines or catalogs.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product.  Gives me renewed confidence in my appearance.</li>
    <li> As for covering bald spots it worked great. It did make my head feel chalky and a bit dirty and I did not like that if I ran my fingers through my hair I would have residue on my fingers and under my nails and this was when I lightly ran my fingers through.     THE BIG ISSUE was with the quality the product arrived in. My compact arrived broken and more powder in the envelope than the container.  And the brush is garbage. Sheds like crazy.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the hair thinning powder, instead I received organic lotion with the hair thinning label on it.</li>
    <li> Used to be able to buy this at CVS.  Was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  This works better than all of the other similar type products.</li>
    <li> This fill in powder is working for me I have just a little of a bald spot but with this is covered just that I need to apply a lot and it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes</li>
    <li> YES! THIS PRODUCT DID COVER MY BALD SPOT COMPLETELY. THANK YOU/</li>
    <li> Just ok for covering gray hair. But if you have a bald spot it works great.</li>
    <li> powder is good, use a different brush. this one loses it&#x27;s bristles all over the place.</li>
