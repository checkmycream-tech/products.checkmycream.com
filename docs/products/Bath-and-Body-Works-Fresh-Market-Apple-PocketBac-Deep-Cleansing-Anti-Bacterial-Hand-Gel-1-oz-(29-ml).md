    <li> It&#x27;s almost 5 dollars for a little 1.5inch bottle! Only enough for like 6 or 9 uses. I thought it would be much bigger!</li>
    <li> Great smell and long lasting............&lt;br /&gt;I put it on and the beautiful smell lasts a good hr..&lt;br /&gt;Very gentle on your hands . Love it .......</li>
    <li> I orded two of these and expected them to be a normal size for hand soap. They came together in an evelope which puzzeled me until I opened it. I was horribly disappointed when I saw they were each about two applications. When I visit my daughters, we are able to go to the Bath &amp; Body works store where I purchase several containers of their wonderful scented soaps. It had not occured to me that their online items would be a complete rip-off. I will never order their products online again and may not even purchase them at the mall.</li>
