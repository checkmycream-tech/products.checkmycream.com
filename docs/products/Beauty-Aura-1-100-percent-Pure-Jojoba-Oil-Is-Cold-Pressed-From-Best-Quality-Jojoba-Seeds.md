    <li> I am absolutely loving my Jojoba Oil by Beauty Aura!!! I tried 3 or 4 different brands before this one and I liked them but this is love! The scent is the best I have tried. It can be a strong smell but not Beauty Aura, it&#x27;s very subtle. Another thing that I love about their Jojoba oil is the bottle that it comes in. I don&#x27;t drip it all over the place like I do when I am using a dropper that most come with. This bottle is so much easier and neater to use. In my opinion Jojoba oil is a must have. I use it on my hair, body and nails. It leaves my hair feeling so soft and my skin has a glow that it never has come spring. I use it after shaving and never have itchy legs. It&#x27;s fantastic!
