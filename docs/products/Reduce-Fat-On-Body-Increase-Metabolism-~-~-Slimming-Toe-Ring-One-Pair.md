### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not that impressed.</li>
      <li>all is good!!</li>
      <li>Great product for the price</li>
      <li>Anyway, I am also a great believer in foot reflexology.</li>
      <li>works great for skinny people.</li>
      <li>I found my appetite was greatly diminished, and when I did eat I didn’t have the urge to overindulge.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And the times I have had accupressure and foot reflexology, and how amazing I feel after, I am going to give these a shot, see what happens.</li>
      <li>I wore my friend&#x27;s rings for a week before purchasing my own.</li>
      <li>Fit great seems to be working, I&#x27;m very pleased with the fit.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re okay</li>
      <li>but i did feel my posture better</li>
      <li>so Im okay with it.</li>
      <li>I do not know if I should have the magnets on top of my toe or underneath.  </li>
      <li>Just eat better and save your money.</li>
      <li>well to me there OK to wear</li>
      <li>First a disclaimer - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They fit just fine on my toes.</li>
      <li>I guess that&#x27;s why it was so cheap.</li>
      <li>These slimming toe rings really come in handy and they don’t cause any side effects.</li>
      <li>However, after wearing awhile they do get bigger for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;Again great product for the price.</li>
      <li>Those spots move the energy thru all of the organs they need to get to, to promote weight loss, and just general good health.</li>
      <li>I am not a new ager, but happily I am hippy dippy.</li>
      <li>Other wise for the price they were worth a try!!  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t think this item useful.</li>
      <li>about $2, these are definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>For the price of these rings, I would say they are definitely worth purchasing.</li>
      <li>The result is that you will both correct your walking posture and also effectively exercise your muscles that are not regularly used when you walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t think this item useful.</li>
      <li>Enjoying the feeling of it on my foot, very light, not too tight.</li>
      <li>The silicon is soft and they are comfortable.</li>
      <li>, I lost 3 lbs the first week.</li>
      <li>I am very disappoint!</li>
      <li>Barefoot at home, for most of the morning, into mid afternoon, no problems at all.</li>
      <li>A waste of money  , glad it was cheap</li>
      <li>The product originates in Japan and the principle behind it is quite intelligent.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see if this really works</li>
      <li>i dont think this really works,,,</li>
      <li>and i also saw a difference on my appetite.. but haven&#x27;t really wear them.</li>
      <li>Arrived very timely.  </li>
      <li>And where these &amp;#34;magnets&amp;#34; (I don&#x27;t know if they are, or if they just put pressure on the spot they cover) set is directly in line with some useful pressure points.</li>
      <li>Regardless of diet and exercise, I hadn’t seen below 134 pounds in more than a year, until I stepped on the scale the other day and it read 133.5.</li>
      <li>But whatever the reason, I didn&#x27;t go down to my kitchen and have any chocolate covered almonds before writing this review, :)</li>
      <li>That way when you walk, you will be more likely to exercise your inner thigh muscles.</li>
      <li>In that case, just keep shifting them back and let your feet get used to them in the right position for them to work.</li>
      <li>It will only fit on my big toes</li>
      <li>so they’re only slightly uncomfortable, but I was able to wear them day or night, and even with my favorite boots.</li>
      <li>They’re soft silicone</li>
      <li>My appetite has disappeared completely.</li>
      <li>Read the reviews so far, and thought I would share my thoughts.</li>
      <li>But here&#x27;s what I do know so far.</li>
      <li>I only bough these for fun, obviously a crock of crap/</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not uncomfortable, like some other reviewers have said.</li>
      <li>, so I was surprised when these actually seemed to work.</li>
      <li>It indirectly slims you down by having the objective first to correct your leg shape and posture.</li>
      <li>And I am not sure if little magnet goes on bottom of finger or top.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say if this works or not because I couldn&#x27;t get through a half of day wearing them.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really notice that I have it on, but this product curbs my appetite so that I eat less</li>

<li> loose weight by amputating your big toes.</li>
<li> During the process of redressing your figure, the two little magnets underneath the rings can increase your metabolism by stimulating the sensitive nerves and acupuncture points.</li>
<li> so I have no idea how long to wear them etc.</li>
<li> No instructions on how to wear or how long, I am just winging it!</li>
<li> It might just be that the awareness makes me less likely to go snack, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
<li> They were a little bit bigger than my toes, but I did not feel any uncomfortableness.</li>
<li> course, they will feel a little bit uncomfortable at first, but do give it a try.</li>
<li> Not worth waiting to get.</li>
<li> Not worth the time.</li>
<li> i felt it every where i walked not worth it.</li>
<li> I noticed my craving for sweets went way down.</li>
<li> I feel like I was let down.</li>
<li> For less than $2, why not give them a try?</li>
<li> I don’t know how or why these little toe rings work, but within three days of putting them on the numbers on my scale started to go down.</li>
<li> A little.</li>
<li> /&gt;The rings do take a little getting used to.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> waste of money.</li>
<li> dnt waste your money.</li>
<li> The &amp;#34;metal thing&amp;#34; on the bottom is not completely comfortable.</li>
<li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Waste of money, do not work at all.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> From the initial look of these, they appeared to be uncomfortable wearing but while wearing I do notice a slight difference in my appetite being curved.  </li>
<li> I like these little things!</li>
<li> it also hurt like hell on one foot but not the other foot not good.</li>
<li> When I do eat I eat very little</li>
<li> don&#x27;t find it uncomfortable at all, and I definitely notice a reduction in appetite.</li>
<li> And ya know what, the power of the mind is unbelievable.</li>
<li> I am not sure about this product.  </li>
<li> The product is uncomfortable, and nowhere on the internet can I find the proper way to wear them</li>
<li> Was disappointed one of them broke on the first day</li>
<li> If the rings are too loose for you, the magnets will slant in the wrong direction.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s hard to say if it work now.</li>

<li> IT IS HELPING AT LEAST FOR ME</li>
<li> Slowly and painlessly...</li>
<li> well i put this rings for a week and this work slow</li>
<li> It is a little uncomfortable to wear.</li>
<li> I was disappointed there were no directions with this item at all, So I am only guessing how to wear it.  </li>
<li> I just couldn&#x27;t take the irritating feeling to wear them any longer.</li>
<li> : I wore these out to the grocery store, and no, they are not great to walk on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my weight or energy, maybe if you wear it for a year it might show some results</li>
    <li> nothing  happened on this one don&#x27;t recommend to buy it..</li>
    <li> It is a little uncomfortable to wear. And I am not sure if little magnet goes on bottom of finger or top.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work. Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> Just received my toe rings. Fit great seems to be working, I&#x27;m very pleased with the fit.</li>
    <li> well i put this rings for a week and this work slow but work i don&#x27;t know is that placebo effect but it works</li>
    <li> still i have same weight .i don&#x27;t think this item useful. but still i am using maybe it  work. i don&#x27;t think this item useful.</li>
    <li> I can feel them when I walk. It was stated that you can&#x27;t feel them or almost invisible...Mine were so uncomfortable that I had to take them off.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, do not work at all. I guess that&#x27;s why it was so cheap.</li>
    <li> loose weight by amputating your big toes. Slowly and painlessly...like they do to sheet perhaps. works great for skinny people.</li>
    <li> It Does Not Work, is just a lie.</li>
    <li> I don’t know how or why these little toe rings work, but within three days of putting them on the numbers on my scale started to go down. I tried these rings because I was desperate to get over the plateau I had been on in my attempt to lose 20 pounds. Regardless of diet and exercise, I hadn’t seen below 134 pounds in more than a year, until I stepped on the scale the other day and it read 133.5. Success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rings do take a little getting used to. They’re soft silicone so they’re only slightly uncomfortable, but I was able to wear them day or night, and even with my favorite boots. I found my appetite was greatly diminished, and when I did eat I didn’t have the urge to overindulge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about $2, these are definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed there were no directions with this item at all, So I am only guessing how to wear it.  It will only fit on my big toes and then I have to wear socks so they don&#x27;t fall off.  Other wise for the price they were worth a try!!  all is good!!</li>
    <li> used this product for quite a while did not see the use.</li>
    <li> They were a little bit bigger than my toes, but I did not feel any uncomfortableness. I do not know if I am losing weight or not, so it&#x27;s hard to say if it work now.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I actually bought this.</li>
    <li> These slimming toe rings really come in handy and they don’t cause any side effects. The product originates in Japan and the principle behind it is quite intelligent. It indirectly slims you down by having the objective first to correct your leg shape and posture. During the process of redressing your figure, the two little magnets underneath the rings can increase your metabolism by stimulating the sensitive nerves and acupuncture points. That way when you walk, you will be more likely to exercise your inner thigh muscles. The result is that you will both correct your walking posture and also effectively exercise your muscles that are not regularly used when you walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, they will feel a little bit uncomfortable at first, but do give it a try. If you feel that they are rubbing against your skin, just take them out for several hours. If the rings are too loose for you, the magnets will slant in the wrong direction. In that case, just keep shifting them back and let your feet get used to them in the right position for them to work. For the price of these rings, I would say they are definitely worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> &#x3D;( nothing noticeable</li>
    <li> A waste of money  , glad it was cheap</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> when i got them i have no idea why i got it but just to try i felt it every where i walked not worth it.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re okay but I&#x27;m not that impressed.</li>
    <li> I only bough these for fun, obviously a crock of crap/</li>
    <li> Arrived very timely.  The product is uncomfortable, and nowhere on the internet can I find the proper way to wear them so they press on the correct point.  Some pictures show with the button out and some show it against the skin.  It hurts when it presses against my toe calluses.  I hope this works!</li>
    <li> This just did nothing for me...it also hurt like hell on one foot but not the other foot not good.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed one of them broke on the first day</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work and was extremely uncomfortable on my feet. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews so far, and thought I would share my thoughts. Now, I just got them today (August 1, 2015). So, I have no idea if they are going to work or not. But here&#x27;s what I do know so far. They fit just fine on my toes. I have not tried them with shoes on yet, but I never wear shoes, unless I am going to work or out in public where a lack of shoes would be gross. Anyway, I am also a great believer in foot reflexology. And where these &amp;#34;magnets&amp;#34; (I don&#x27;t know if they are, or if they just put pressure on the spot they cover) set is directly in line with some useful pressure points. Those spots move the energy thru all of the organs they need to get to, to promote weight loss, and just general good health. And ya know what, the power of the mind is unbelievable. If you KNOW something is going to work, it will. Because you are using your energies to help it along. If you are sitting there thinking I am some hippy dippy new-ager.... I am not a new ager, but happily I am hippy dippy. And the times I have had accupressure and foot reflexology, and how amazing I feel after, I am going to give these a shot, see what happens. Will review again once I have some experience.   Still August 1, 2015: I wore these out to the grocery store, and no, they are not great to walk on. The &amp;#34;metal thing&amp;#34; on the bottom is not completely comfortable. That was wearing shoes tho. Barefoot at home, for most of the morning, into mid afternoon, no problems at all. Will update on progress(or not).</li>
    <li> I just recently received the toe bands. I don&#x27;t feel a difference yet.  They are to big for my toes so I wrap sports tape to hold in place. The silicon is soft and they are comfortable. Instructions are in Chinese so I have no idea how long to wear them etc.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s a rip off dnt waste your money.</li>
    <li> From the initial look of these, they appeared to be uncomfortable wearing but while wearing I do notice a slight difference in my appetite being curved.  I believe this will assist in my hunger spurts I will continue to wear until I know different.</li>
    <li> well to me there OK to wear did not bother my toes but i did feel my posture better and i also saw a difference on my appetite.. but haven&#x27;t really wear them.</li>
    <li> IT IS HELPING AT LEAST FOR ME</li>
    <li> Great product for the price, I lost 3 lbs the first week. Well purchase again. However, after wearing awhile they do get bigger for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;Again great product for the price. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really notice that I have it on, but this product curbs my appetite so that I eat less and I am not hungry,</li>
    <li> I feel like I was let down. Didn&#x27;t work the way that it advertised. I am very disappoint!</li>
    <li> i dont think this really works,,,</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this product.  I am still waiting to see results.  I do not know if I should have the magnets on top of my toe or underneath.  No instructions on how to wear or how long, I am just winging it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say if this works or not because I couldn&#x27;t get through a half of day wearing them. It felt like I had a rock in my shoe and I was just smashing it in all day. I just couldn&#x27;t take the irritating feeling to wear them any longer.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see if this really works</li>
    <li> I like these little things! Is it weird having stuff on your toes? A little. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable, like some other reviewers have said. I got used to it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one for losing weight in crazy ways, so I was surprised when these actually seemed to work. I wore my friend&#x27;s rings for a week before purchasing my own. I lost 2 pounds during that week. I noticed my craving for sweets went way down. I don&#x27;t know how these work, but they do! For less than $2, why not give them a try?</li>
    <li> Not worth waiting to get. A joke!  Very uncomfortable, but for  less than a dollar. Just eat better and save your money.</li>
    <li> No not at all. Wring kept twisting not staying in place. The metal piece was hard</li>
    <li> Painful. I was hoping this would work, but started hobbling after only a couple of hours wear. Couldn&#x27;t endure them no matter what position and had to take them off.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, I haven&#x27;t received it yet</li>
    <li> My appetite has disappeared completely. When I do eat I eat very little or else I feel horrible. But it is also gonna make me lose weight so Im okay with it.</li>
    <li> Not worth the time. Did not work for me.</li>
    <li> this item did nothing for weight lost. waste of money.</li>
    <li> First a disclaimer - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find it uncomfortable at all, and I definitely notice a reduction in appetite. Enjoying the feeling of it on my foot, very light, not too tight. It might just be that the awareness makes me less likely to go snack, I don&#x27;t know. But whatever the reason, I didn&#x27;t go down to my kitchen and have any chocolate covered almonds before writing this review, :)</li>
