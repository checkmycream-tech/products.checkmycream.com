    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and makes my hair smell really nasty it smells like men&#x27;s cologne</li>
    <li> I have always had issues will my hair growing longer than the bottom of my bra, but after using this product my hair has grown longer,faster and even healthier!!!!!! It is something I use weekly, and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love it is excellent!!</li>
    <li> My scalp feels good when I use it but it has not&lt;br /&gt;promoted any hair growth.</li>

    <li> I have used this product...its great ...</li>
    <li> Great thing i have ever bought. I haven&#x27;t seen any real results but its the best thing i brought for hair</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work, this product are not the same since the brothers that owns the company split. I used back in the 2008 and was a excellent product not anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this product ! Great for your hair and does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised for!</li>
    <li> It is wonderful.  I noticed thicker hair and small growth emerging on my scalp both front and back.  I felt added volume whenever I comb and brush my hair in which I did feel before.  I am in my one month application and expecting more growth thicker hair in the future.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily after taking a  shower. After a month , I can say its a decent product but it takes too long to see real&lt;br /&gt;results ...I have just noticed modest improvements</li>
    <li> I just received this product on May 14th so I cannot honestly provide a results review.  The product smelled great!  It also made my hair soft.  I will give another review in a few weeks if applicable.</li>
    <li> My product arrived on time, I had no problem with the shipping,,,I&#x27;m still using this product, for abt a month now and I&#x27;ve seen great results so far, my hair grew and felt thicker, I love the smell and it gives a tingly feeling on my scalp which I love.. I would definitely Order more</li>
    <li> I am currently using thifours product every time  I shampoo my hair and have been using it for about 6 months now and have noticed that it works, I will continue using it</li>
    <li> I like it a lot my hair looks good.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair is of long length and have been using the Alter Ego drops for years in combination with my garlic conditioner.  I decided to try something different to give my scalp/hair additional nourishment and Kismera has done the job.  Also, the seller responded immediately to my question.  I am very pleased with my purchase, pleased with the price compared to the website I typically purchase my Dominican products...needless to say, I will be a repeat customer for life.</li>
    <li> its okay I love my alter ego one better......</li>
