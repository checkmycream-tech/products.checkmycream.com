      <li>Okay, I need to write seven more words in order to be done with this review...</li>
      <li>I have  pair of $20 barber shears, and these Fromm scissors are much better.  </li>
      <li>I just thought it would be a bit more smoother.</li>
      <li>I love being able to cut my hair again, between hair cuts.</li>
      <li>and it was ok.</li>
      <li>I really love these shears.</li>
      <li>, thus they don&#x27;t fit my hand, they just fit on the tips of my figures and it hurts!</li>
      <li>I mainly purchased this item for trimming my own hair in which i already tried it once</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!  </li>
      <li>bought these to cut both my brothers hair and my own, however the finger holes are smaller</li>
      <li>so I wanted a good sharp pair of scissors.  </li>
      <li>They are nice and sharp and give a clean cut.</li>
      <li>Are very sharp, easy to hold, easy to manuever and easy to store for a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t think much about it until my finger was covered in blood!</li>
      <li>They cut all the hair the first time - no hair sliding off the scissors while shearing.</li>
      <li>Great price in comparison to Japanese shears and will cost less to sharpen when the time comes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never owned real scissors for cutting hair before, but I&#x27;m very happy with these.</li>
      <li>These seem to be very well made and for the cost</li>
      <li>These definitely are good and are way sharp.  </li>
      <li>I love them, however, I don&#x27;t use them when I trim my husband&#x27;s eyebrows as they are just too sharp.</li>
      <li>I cut my hair dry, and with the cheaper scissors, I hear a \\&quot;crunch\\&quot; sound when I cut my ends.  </li>
      <li>But the shears seem to me to be a fine piece of machine work: very, very sharp.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an average size person and they are comfortable in my hand</li>
      <li>I have used it about five times so far and it feels like new.</li>
      <li>i have used it for few trims and feel that it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair but rather smoothly cuts its.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trimming my own ends for about a year now since I got tired of scissor-happy stylists.  </li>
      <li>As others have said, the finger holes in these shears are designed for fingers that are small compared to most American males.  </li>
      <li>Nice and sharp, smooth cutting action.</li>
      <li>These are nice and sharp and do a great job of cutting my thick course hair.</li>
      <li>24 year old male here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are just the right size to do little snips.</li>
      <li>I do not recommend that people start cutting their own hair if they don&#x27;t  know how to do it, but these scissors are great for maintenance at home if someone is cutting about half an inch or so and they are definitely great for short hairdos especially for finishing areas above the ears and behind the neck.  </li>
      <li>I am a thrifty person but learning to invest in high quality products to last a long time.</li>
      <li>High Quality Sharp Silent Cut</li>

<li> High Quality Sharp Silent Cut</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve owned a few pairs of hair cutting scissors, and so far these are my favorite (and most expensive, although not by much).</li>
<li> This is EXACTLY what I was looking for (minus the cut), because the sharper your scissors are, the less likely your hair&#x27;s ends will fray and turn into splits.</li>
<li> They are worth the money; I just hope I didn&#x27;t dull them by cutting my finger :)</li>
<li> Before I bought a lot of sheep shears around 15-20 dollar and they didn´t last long at all!</li>
<li> I have long layered hair and a lot of people</li>
<li> They are sharp and solidly built.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how sharp these are.  </li>
<li> Came with instructions to ensure blades stay sharp.</li>
<li> so be careful, because they are very sharp.  </li>
<li> I did some research on hair cutting tools and found out how important scissors are (especially sharp scissors).  </li>
<li> I have been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for years and have tried all kinds of scissors, but none of them compare to these new shears I purchased.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for quite some time and had never invested in professional shears.  </li>
<li> We&#x27;ve been needing some REAL hair cutting scissors forever!  </li>
<li> I cut my hair at home now, and I&#x27;ve no trouble with split ends, which I know can be caused by bad scissors.</li>
<li> and since I was looking for scissors to cut my hair when its dry, I needed beveled blades which were recommended for dry cutting or cutting hair before shampoo</li>
<li> So now its back to using my paper cutting scissors :(</li>
<li> If you buy these shears you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> I use this for my family&#x27;s trims between cuts, works great. Red grips are removable for sizing/comfort. Nice and sharp, smooth cutting action. Came with instructions to ensure blades stay sharp.</li>
    <li> Great &amp; precise! Next time, I will buy I bigger sized blade.  My husband did throw away the cushion from the finger grip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming my own ends for about a year now since I got tired of scissor-happy stylists.  Before I started learning to cut my own hair I did some research on hair cutting tools and found out how important scissors are (especially sharp scissors).  The best are made in Germany and Japan.  The Japanese shears were way out of my budget and since I was looking for scissors to cut my hair when its dry, I needed beveled blades which were recommended for dry cutting or cutting hair before shampoo so I got these Fromm shears.  They are amazing.  I have cut myself twice while cleaning them so be careful, because they are very sharp.  I have long layered hair and a lot of people ask me who cuts my hair and gasp when I tell them I do it myself.  I do not recommend that people start cutting their own hair if they don&#x27;t  know how to do it, but these scissors are great for maintenance at home if someone is cutting about half an inch or so and they are definitely great for short hairdos especially for finishing areas above the ears and behind the neck.  Great price in comparison to Japanese shears and will cost less to sharpen when the time comes.</li>
    <li> These arrived today and I started doing my trim and I accidently cut my finger and I didn&#x27;t think much about it until my finger was covered in blood! I couldn&#x27;t believe how sharp these are.  This is EXACTLY what I was looking for (minus the cut), because the sharper your scissors are, the less likely your hair&#x27;s ends will fray and turn into splits. This is what I am trying to avoid, as I&#x27;m growing out my hair.  I have  pair of $20 barber shears, and these Fromm scissors are much better.  I cut my hair dry, and with the cheaper scissors, I hear a \\&quot;crunch\\&quot; sound when I cut my ends.  I don&#x27;t hear anything when I cut with these.  They are worth the money; I just hope I didn&#x27;t dull them by cutting my finger :)</li>
    <li> They are just the right size to do little snips. They cut all the hair the first time - no hair sliding off the scissors while shearing. Nice heft, too.</li>
    <li> As others have said, the finger holes in these shears are designed for fingers that are small compared to most American males.  But the shears seem to me to be a fine piece of machine work: very, very sharp.  I am not a pro barber, so I don&#x27;t have a basis for comparison.  But tey work great for me.</li>
    <li> 24 year old male here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these to cut both my brothers hair and my own, however the finger holes are smaller then a nickel in size, thus they don&#x27;t fit my hand, they just fit on the tips of my figures and it hurts! So now its back to using my paper cutting scissors :(</li>
    <li> It took me a while of searching before I decided on this shear. I didn´t want to buy something too sheep that will only last for a couple of using´s. I´m glad I took my time and read a lot of reviews cause this is a really good shear that dosen´t burn a hole in your wallet. I have used it about five times so far and it feels like new. Before I bought a lot of sheep shears around 15-20 dollar and they didn´t last long at all! Remember to wipe the blades of and put a drop of oil on them after every using as the instruction says to keep it last longer.</li>

    <li> These seem to be very well made and for the cost I feel that they are a good purchase.  I would recommend these if you are in the market.</li>
    <li> I really love these shears. They are sharp and solidly built. I&#x27;m an average size person and they are comfortable in my hand</li>
    <li> I am a thrifty person but learning to invest in high quality products to last a long time. I plan to cut our family hair and save money from hair places.  Theses scissors are great. Nice hold, amazing sharpness - 1 snip and the hair is gone, it doesn&#x27;t take several open and close to cut my son&#x27;s coarse hair like I was doing before with a low end pair of scissors.</li>
    <li> High Quality Sharp Silent Cut That Meets My Expectations&lt;br /&gt;Great Steel, Good Fit After You Take Out The Rubber Incerts</li>
    <li> These shears cut like butter. Are very sharp, easy to hold, easy to manuever and easy to store for a very reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for quite some time and had never invested in professional shears.  Wish I had purchased these sooner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few pairs of hair cutting scissors, and so far these are my favorite (and most expensive, although not by much). They are nice and sharp and give a clean cut. I also like the rubbery texture on the inside of the handles - makes it easier to keep them in place, I think.</li>
    <li> These are nice and sharp and do a great job of cutting my thick course hair.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for years and have tried all kinds of scissors, but none of them compare to these new shears I purchased.  These are great!</li>

    <li> We&#x27;ve been needing some REAL hair cutting scissors forever!  Definitely worth the money!  Okay, I need to write seven more words in order to be done with this review...phew, I made it!</li>
    <li> EVEN my hair stylists like my hair cut. LOL  Yes the shears are great. I love being able to cut my hair again, between hair cuts. If you buy these shears you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
