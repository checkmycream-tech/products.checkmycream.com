      <li>I&#x27;ve had lots of compliments on smelling nice &amp; that&#x27;s always a positive!!</li>
      <li>Clean and fresh not overpowering and lasts a good while.</li>
      <li>and I think this flanker from Dunhill is an easy thumbs up.  </li>
      <li>All three concluded that Dunhill Desire Blue was the most attractive fragrance.</li>
      <li>this use to be the cologne girls died over in my High School, and with good reason.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is pretty good but the longetivity is not as good as the red one.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells so good for non designer stuff, I met my husband wearing this cologne and looked forever to find it, reminds me of Ralph Lauren blue for Men this is a light sexy smell</li>
      <li>a must for any guy, and deff a great present when you don&#x27;t know what to give someone.</li>
      <li>The ending is basically a light tonka or musk.&lt;br</li>
      <li>its light with just a hint of musk</li>
      <li>When i wore this during a free hugs campaign.</li>
      <li>Desire Blue is a very nice citrus/aquatic.  </li>
      <li>The original one that I used could stay for a day.  </li>
      <li>Good product with low price</li>
      <li>The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Desire blue is prob the best of all aquatic based fragrances out there and definitely a must have in your collection...</li>
      <li>bought this for my dad since its his favorite and was such a great buy since the price is pretty low.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and smooth - almost fruit like, or &amp;#34;fresh out of the bath&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s hard to describe, but the women definitely love it.</li>
      <li>It is a fresh scent.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>The notes are fresh and invigorating.</li>
      <li>Wow, took a chance without even smelling this since I really liked desire red, desire blue is amazing!</li>
      <li>somehow that dosn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
      <li>Good except that we noticed a milder fragrance than the previous one we got at a store.  </li>
      <li>I would love to use this second to Clinique Happy and my third preference would probably be its brother the Dunhill Desire Red.  </li>
      <li>Love it for a daily use</li>
      <li>They sent me as soon and safe as possible ...</li>
      <li>i love the smell of this stuff, and this bottle is big.</li>
      <li>It has a light, fruity, and soft opening.  </li>
      <li>i love the smell of this stuff, and this bottle is big.  </li>
      <li>This scent, thanks to me, is tied to various fantastic crimes.</li>
      <li>To confess, I am not really much of an &#x27;Aquatic&#x27; fragrance guy but just love this...</li>
      <li>i dont think anyone can really describe a scent</li>
      <li>thanks dudes</li>
      <li>It is a good fragance and my wife loves it, and as it is not a very commom parfum (at least here in Brazil), it is even better because I have my almost exclusive fragance.</li>
      <li>Heavenly, gentlemanly scent, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>The litchi really stays noticeable throughout the length of this scent.  </li>
      <li>You need to squirt a lot of it as opposed to a spray or two from the real thing.</li>
      <li>Dunhill Fresh is the only colgone worth purchasing from Dunhill.</li>
      <li>Like other reviews have said, make sure the package says, \\&quot;Alfred Dunhill Desire Blue\\&quot; on it.</li>
      <li>Classic daytime fragrance.</li>
      <li>That being said, I love this as an everyday scent.</li>
      <li>Go sample it at your local beautician counter, its worth it.  </li>
      <li>It really is unique and smells like you would have spent hundreds on this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Some fruit, a subtle hint of musk really sets this cologne apart from the rest in my collection that are more woodsy.</li>
      <li>only problem I have with the bottle is that one press of the dispenser cap shoots out way too much cologne for a normal application at one pulse point.</li>
      <li>a truly unique scent that&#x27;s not very easily placed.</li>
      <li>I know the Dunhill desire blue very well</li>
      <li>You cant go wrong with a scent like this, very calm and cool, yet it can be classy as well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product with low price</li>
    <li> The scent will have lovely people inches from you before they know it. It literally is a lasso smell.&lt;br /&gt;It should be called &amp;#34;Inexorably Drawn.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;If there was a scent that inspired like those ridic Ax commercials, this would be it. Holy take me home. Women, men, sheep, all flock to catch a closer smell of this divine fragrance. I once had a really excellent night with lots of fun and people and things, best time. Then I realized I was actually alone all night.&lt;br /&gt;This scent just makes magic happen.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it though. This scent, thanks to me, is tied to various fantastic crimes. And it requires copious amounts of swag. People except you to back this scent up with glorious action.</li>
    <li> It is a good fragance and my wife loves it, and as it is not a very commom parfum (at least here in Brazil), it is even better because I have my almost exclusive fragance. It is a fresh scent.</li>
    <li> i love the smell of this stuff, and this bottle is big. good buy&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for my husband a while back &amp; it is now his signature fragrance. It would make any man smell attractive! it&#x27;s that good! :)</li>
    <li> Very good fresh scent..  I would love to use this second to Clinique Happy and my third preference would probably be its brother the Dunhill Desire Red.  Heavenly, gentlemanly scent, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend wears this. He just happened to go to the mall and pick this out. He has never worn it before. OH MY! It smells so good I can hardly stop smelling it when he puts it on. Its so refreshing.I wish it came in a womens scent. You wont be disappointed fella&#x27;s and ladies get this for him! Well actually it will be for YOU!</li>
    <li> Anything Dunhill is a hit !</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband a while back &amp; it is now his signature fragrance. It would make any man smell attractive! it&#x27;s that good! :)</li>
    <li> I loved it ... i do knew this wonderful fragrance and bought it. They sent me as soon and safe as possible ... thanks dudes</li>
    <li> Love it for a daily use</li>
    <li> Awesome scent for the price!</li>
    <li> i dont think anyone can really describe a scent but this has a very pleasant one. its light with just a hint of musk and i want to say floral but somehow that dosn&#x27;t seem right. i will say though it makes me think about the beach. a truly unique scent that&#x27;s not very easily placed. a must for any guy, and deff a great present when you don&#x27;t know what to give someone.</li>
    <li> To confess, I am not really much of an &#x27;Aquatic&#x27; fragrance guy but just love this... Desire blue is prob the best of all aquatic based fragrances out there and definitely a must have in your collection...the lasting power too is very impressive...I have a decent collection of about 30 odd bottles, and, I rate this as one of my favorites along with Jean Paul Gaultier, Issey Miyaki Leau&#x27;D Issey (among the expensive ones) and Obsession Night-CK and Bulgari Aqua (not aqua marine) among the slightly cheaper ones...I would suggest it as a  blind buy online, even if u havent given it a testing shot, before,  at a store...You will NOT be disappointed...!!!</li>
    <li> Good except that we noticed a milder fragrance than the previous one we got at a store.  Otherwise, it is a great product..</li>
    <li> Classic daytime fragrance.</li>
    <li> Not great. Dunhill Fresh is the only colgone worth purchasing from Dunhill.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews have said, make sure the package says, \\&quot;Alfred Dunhill Desire Blue\\&quot; on it. That being said, I love this as an everyday scent. It&#x27;s unfortunate that it&#x27;s not in production anymore, so grab a 3.4oz while you can and it will last you for quite a while. For an aquatic scent, there&#x27;s a note I can&#x27;t quite put my nose on (see what I did there) but it helps put a punctuation mark on the fragrance.</li>
    <li> good product, i smell great</li>
    <li> My Son loves this cologne and so do I !  It Smells amazing !&lt;br /&gt; I also love the Great price too.</li>
    <li> Classic with a great scent and lots of compliments from my colleagues.</li>
    <li> Wow, took a chance without even smelling this since I really liked desire red, desire blue is amazing! The notes are fresh and invigorating. Some fruit, a subtle hint of musk really sets this cologne apart from the rest in my collection that are more woodsy. It really is unique and smells like you would have spent hundreds on this fragrance. I&#x27;m very impressed, well done house of Dunhill, well done!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in great shape.  Cologne was as described...no knock-off.</li>
    <li> Desire Blue is a very nice citrus/aquatic.  It has a light, fruity, and soft opening.  The heart of DB is the sea notes with a slight woody background.  The litchi really stays noticeable throughout the length of this scent.  The ending is basically a light tonka or musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are sometimes good reasons why fragrances are popular and I think this flanker from Dunhill is an easy thumbs up.  It&#x27;s different enough from your average citrus or aquatic that it may very well deserve a place on your shelf.</li>
    <li> This product is fake. The original one that I used could stay for a day.  Cheap price means bad quality!</li>
    <li> GoT here on time got it for my husband n he loves it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband after getting a sample and he smells wonderful with it on. He is always getting compliments and people asking what cologne he is wearing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve three lady friends rate this cologne versus Baldessarini for Men by Hugo Boss, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and Ferrari Passion. All three concluded that Dunhill Desire Blue was the most attractive fragrance. One of the ladies said the aroma was \\&quot;divine\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with the bottle is that one press of the dispenser cap shoots out way too much cologne for a normal application at one pulse point. Of course, you can work around that by pouring the cologne in a different bottle, or by rubbing off from one area to others.</li>
    <li> Worst perfume ever bought. Doesn&#x27;t last even for 1 hour. Avoid it if your looking for a perfume which lasts more than 4 hours.</li>
    <li> I always buy Desire Red but this time for a change bought this one. The fragrance is pretty good but the longetivity is not as good as the red one. The effect dimnishes within 3-4 hours. Not worth the amount paid. In my opinion I will not buy this again, will definitely get the red one. If you&#x27;re buying this one have a look at the red one once.</li>
    <li> Ahh the nostalgia.. this use to be the cologne girls died over in my High School, and with good reason. You cant go wrong with a scent like this, very calm and cool, yet it can be classy as well.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful on my man.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good for non designer stuff, I met my husband wearing this cologne and looked forever to find it, reminds me of Ralph Lauren blue for Men this is a light sexy smell</li>
    <li> i love the smell of this stuff, and this bottle is big.  good buy</li>
    <li> Love this perfume I always buy this for my husbend love how smells</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I got this cologne for my boy friend for Christmas. It smells soooooo good on him. I was a little afraid that it may be fake which I expressed after he opened it and said that it&#x27;s real. He has had this before and it is authentic.</li>
    <li> Excellent. i have no complains what so ever about the product. The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne. I&#x27;m really glad I found it on Amazon and I got it at a great price. It smells nice and smooth - almost fruit like, or &amp;#34;fresh out of the bath&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s hard to describe, but the women definitely love it.</li>
    <li> Our family member loved the gift!</li>
    <li> Everyone loves and commend the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells so good. I can&#x27;t get enough of it and I love every time my husband wears it. It smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this to anyone. the smell is way too over bearing and it wreacks hard ahhhhhhh it makes me sick. ill probably wear it when im 100 years old</li>
    <li> This is my casual fragance, I really like it, it is fresh and citric, definetly is one of my favorites</li>
    <li> This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite scent, and I love the way it smells on him! We&#x27;ve tried looking for it at department stores, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
    <li> This cologne is my everyday scent. Clean and fresh not overpowering and lasts a good while. I&#x27;ve had lots of compliments on smelling nice &amp; that&#x27;s always a positive!!</li>
    <li> Another great smelling product from Dunhill for Men. You will be happy to buy this product because also this one attracts the women. Buy it and find out...</li>
    <li> Fake and cant be return I know the Dunhill desire blue very well and I use it for more than two years this item that amazon is selling its fake</li>
    <li> that s a very nice web site and the product are very original i like everything here hope all the best</li>
    <li> Absolutely great fragrance for summer. Long lasting</li>
    <li> bought this for my dad since its his favorite and was such a great buy since the price is pretty low.</li>
    <li> If you like aqua series for you fragrance, you might consider this.. Smells good and fresh for any occasions.. Try it</li>
    <li> For me it wasnt a bad smell at all it just fades too quickly.But it good for a hour or two.Not too bad of a product..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Desire Blue for a decade and I will never buy it from Amazon again. This product is a watered down version of the real thing. You need to squirt a lot of it as opposed to a spray or two from the real thing. My suggestion--- Buy it in store!!!!! You&#x27;ll have to spend the money but it&#x27;s worth it. No shortcuts here!!</li>
    <li> YOU WONT FIND BETTER FOR THE PRICE!</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered on time!</li>
    <li> When i wore this during a free hugs campaign. I recieved over 300 hugs and every girl I hugged complimented on how great i smelled. This hasnt happened with anything else i have worn. So get this. U and other girls will not be disappointed. xD</li>
    <li> Because I have used this product before and I find tasteful. I have recommended your purchase to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Go sample it at your local beautician counter, its worth it.  I wear it exclusively as a winter scent and its not overpowering at all.</li>
