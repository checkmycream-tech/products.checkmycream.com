      <li>I&#x27;m hoping that in time I&#x27;ll adjust to it and the jitters will get better.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>When I bought this I read most of the reviews</li>
      <li>I felt like I HAD to keep moving, so it does give a great boost of energy (I felt jittery and a bit nervous the first day or two but by day three I was just fine, and on the up side</li>
      <li>YOUR LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT USING THIS</li>
      <li>But, so far ... I&#x27;ve had a great experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love to snack and eat, so this a awesome for me to keep my intake down and metabolism up.</li>
      <li>These are super strong!</li>
      <li>They are STRONG so</li>
      <li>In my case I love sweet like, chocolates and ice creams, and now i just even think about it.</li>
      <li>I think it is a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>This is not to be taken lightly.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve gotta say between the results, fabulous price and value</li>
      <li>On my second bottle now, works great and drops the weight off.</li>
      <li>I have purchased multiple products like this before and never have I experienced concerning side affects like this product gave me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using good old Lipodrene with this product: http://www.amazon.com/Extract-Serving-Capsules-Contains-Chlorogenic/dp/B0083U33O4/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I took lipodrene because I had good results with the old version.</li>
      <li>I finally gave in and decided I would try this, seeing as there were so many good reviews.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good and fresh product.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be able to tell when your body is ready for more.</li>
      <li>In the first week I lost about 4 pounds, which is just okay</li>
      <li>Yes this is the original.</li>
      <li>awfully excited I</li>
      <li>It gives my the energy I need to be excited and get through work, not to mentioned I feel like a can run forever when I work out.</li>
      <li>This is what works for me, the original lipodrene.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, this stuff works a good deal better than anything else i&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m buying a few more bottles</li>
      <li>So I had to find something to control everything quickly, and since I wind up getting a dry mouth, I drink way more water, always good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lipodrene and I have been good friends for several years now.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of these types of thermogenic supplements, but only for their ability to give the user a good boost of energy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super encouraged by all the reviews, so I am convinced I will lose 40</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> With the help of these pills, I am able to stay awake at work, while working at least 80 hours a week!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005JMR11K Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals: Lipodrene (Yellow) 90 Tablet]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipodrene and I have been good friends for several years now.  I think it is a fantastic product.  I plan on continuing my use of this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Lost 10 pounds first two weeks. The pills made me a little jittery at first so I split them in half and they worked great. After a couple of days I then started to take them whole. Cut my eating down alot and gave me energy.</li>
    <li> Yes this is the original. I got fed up with trying new products that claimed to have the best ephedra formula. This is what works for me, the original lipodrene. It still has the same formula it always has, before the whole \\&quot;ephedra ban.\\&quot; This one is the best.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle now, works great and drops the weight off. Everyone wants to know what I&#x27;ve done and I&#x27;ve got several friends on this product. I&#x27;ve lost a total of 18 lbs with this product and 30 lbs overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical but decided to try. Well... It DOES make your heart race a bit, it did for me anyway, and I felt like I HAD to keep moving, so it does give a great boost of energy (I felt jittery and a bit nervous the first day or two but by day three I was just fine, and on the up side I didnt get the caffiene crash late in the day you sometimes can experience. It did not affect my ability to get a good night&#x27;s rest one taken in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only take one pill per per day, in the morning after breakfast, not the three recommended on the label. I cant imagine what would happen if I did! I wouldnt eat at all! Just one pill controls my appetite all day up to about 12 hours or so. No hunger whatsoever, no rumbles, no compulsion to snack and I am a major snacker. It seems to have a slight diuretic effect as well which the caffiene will cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, stimulant, yes! You&#x27;ll have tons of energy and it does suppress appetite. I am satisfied with my purchase and intend to buy more. Everyone&#x27;s  body is different so it may not work for you but I&#x27;ve gotta say between the results, fabulous price and value (100 at one a day is a 3 month supply!)...I&#x27;m SOLD!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for people having a hard time curbing their eating habits.. but do not exceed recommended dosage. Very potent. Very effective as a weight loss tool.</li>
    <li> I have taken my fair share of energy boosters and thermogenics. With in 20 minutes I feel a tingle, and slightly warm feeling and then a ton of energy, and I usually have a very high tolerancy. My eating habits are already affected, my portions have deminished considerably, probably more than half what I was able to eat, and I have always had an extremely large appetite, but fortunately have been able to hold my weight with only a little help until recently. My dr put me on a medicine to prevent migranes, and the side effects is gaining weight which happened very fast, about 15-20 lbs in only about 4 to 5 months. So I had to find something to control everything quickly, and since I wind up getting a dry mouth, I drink way more water, always good. So far I&#x27;m impressed. I would not advise if you have a heart problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a diet pill for a few weeks, now. Everything I see either has terrible reviews or very mixed reviews and this was the first one I&#x27;ve come across that actually seems to hold up to its reputation. Over the course of poring through webpages, I&#x27;ve probably read 200+ reviews on this product. Of course there are the occasional negative ones - there are going to be with any product. But, so far ... I&#x27;ve had a great experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, I followed many users&#x27; recommendation of only taking a half pill in the AM and another half before 3:00 PM. This has worked out perfect. After 4 days of that, I switched to 1 pill in the AM and a half pill by 3:00 PM. My heart has been beating faster than normal, but that&#x27;s to be expected with ephedra and caffeine. It&#x27;s nothing alarming, just noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone thinking about buying this, if I could give any bit of advice, it would be one thing: DON&#x27;T BE IMPATIENT. Work up to a higher dose. You&#x27;ll be able to tell when your body is ready for more. If you&#x27;re a coffee drinker, like my boyfriend who is also taking it (I&#x27;m not a caffeine person), you might be okay to take a whole pill the first day. He did, and felt little effect. But, it IS working for both of us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve been taking it for a week and lost 4 pounds. I&#x27;m going to assume some of that is water weight, but I can feel a difference. Let me tell you, I&#x27;m more awake than ever, I&#x27;ve been in a great mood, and have TONS of energy. I started at 135 lbs and have a goal of 125 lbs. As of today, I&#x27;m at 131 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottom line: it works. Don&#x27;t expect miracles without changing your diet and exercising - both of which I&#x27;m easing into. If you don&#x27;t think you can handle a heightened heart rate and feeling \\&quot;peppy\\&quot;, then it&#x27;s not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after we&#x27;re done with the bottle! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******Forgot to mention - It REALLY curbs your appetite. The other day at work, a co-worker offered me cake. I NEVER turn down a piece of cake. lol. Well, I did this time and it didn&#x27;t even cross my mind. I wasn&#x27;t even in the mood for it. So, that has been a definite plus.</li>
    <li> lost weight with these, gave boost of energy and curbed appetite big time. I started off with half because felt jittery at first until I was able to take whole. Works very well. It  has to have the 25mg of ephedra, the one without doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product just because the positiv reviews, so i gave a chance, and i need to tell that this was the best product ever. its really help me. Its not miracle, but if you do exercice and be carefull with the food so will help a lot. In my case I love sweet like, chocolates and ice creams, and now i just even think about it. I´m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps.Sorry my english.</li>
    <li> I took lipodrene because I had good results with the old version. This new version is horrible, it made me so sick I could not go to work for 2 days. I did not lose any weight and did not notice anything except the stomach pains. Good luck with this.</li>
    <li> Felt the need to write a review on this.  I was starving when I took this and within 15 minutes of taking, could not finish my salad.  Definitely curbed my appetite, FAST but I started wigging in 30 minutes.  I could literally see my chest rising from my heart pounding.  One hour since I took and now I am starting to chill a bit. I will break in half next time.  If it does it again, I will not continue using.</li>
    <li> Lipid tend always delivers. It pushes me for great workouts and helps control my appetite. If you&#x27;re looking for that extra push you&#x27;ve got to try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using good old Lipodrene with this product: http://www.amazon.com/Extract-Serving-Capsules-Contains-Chlorogenic/dp/B0083U33O4/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipodrene is great for reducing appetite, but green coffee bean extract helps reduce fat. I heard about green coffee on the Dr Oz show and am getting fantastic results using it with Lipodrene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipodrene is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of these types of thermogenic supplements, but only for their ability to give the user a good boost of energy. I have insomnia pretty bad, but these work quite well at giving me a good boost for the day. The weight loss factor is good as well. I&#x27;m not overweight, but these definitely seem to help reveal more definition in my abs, as well as enhancing my Apollos belt. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Lipodrene really does control my appetite, but it makes me feel jittery &amp; nervous.  I&#x27;ve only been taking it about a week, so I&#x27;m hoping that in time I&#x27;ll adjust to it and the jitters will get better.  Meanwhile, I&#x27;m willing to stick with it because it works so well.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good and fresh product. Hard to tell from the picture a bit, but this is the version of Lipodrene which has ephedra in it.</li>
    <li> After trying another supplement, I will probably be buying Lipodrene again. It gives my the energy I need to be excited and get through work, not to mentioned I feel like a can run forever when I work out. I take one about a half hour before I work out and it&#x27;s great. I have only taken one at a time, twice a day so that I don&#x27;t over do it. The appetite suppressant is great, it lasts about 6 hours before I even start thinking about being hungry. I love to snack and eat, so this a awesome for me to keep my intake down and metabolism up.</li>
    <li> Been taking this for a couple days and the caffeine is what&#x27;s horrible about it...  If it didn&#x27;t have caffeine it would be a good product but the caffeine boosts energy and makes me twitchy and gittery and shaky.  Weight loss wise I&#x27;m losing a pound a day at least but I&#x27;m on a VEGAN diet since I stopped eating meat and been drinking Pineapple juice, apple juice, pineapple slices, broccoli, celery, tomatoes and I feel freaking great!  My stomach is super flat and I can see my ribs stick out I love being SKINNY!  Just need to lose 30 lbs and I&#x27;m at my IDEAL weight of 180 lbs!</li>
    <li> I ordered this Lipodrene expecting it to be the regular, non-ephedra stuff. It took a long time to get to me because of the USPS being so glacially slow. Once I took the first pill though.....WOW ! this is some potent stuff. It keeps the appetite away, revs up your metabolism and makes me feel like i&#x27;m revved up on pure energy. Order early, so you can deal with the USPS slow delivery, the Lipodrene is great though.</li>
    <li> I ordered these pills based on the multiple good reviews they received and was sadly dissapointed. Not that I expected a miracle (you take that chance when ordering things like this) but because when the product was making me feel VERY jittery with an abnormally high heartbeat, the company would not refund my money when I told them about it. They stated that the product could not be returned because they do not \\&quot;promise results\\&quot;. I explained to them that it wasn&#x27;t that I was unhappy with the lack of results but that their product felt unsafe and in that case, should always offer a refund. I have purchased multiple products like this before and never have I experienced concerning side affects like this product gave me. I urge you, as a customer who was dooped by this company already, please do not buy this product. There are plenty of others out there that are better and would offer a refund if not completely satisfied. Just saying.....</li>
    <li> These are super strong! Please start with half pills. My heart went nuts with the whole pill. I take one half and then take another half a few hours later. It has really cut my appetite. It takes a little while to kick in but when it does I have no desire to snack or eat very much. I have very little weight to lose and this is just what I needed for the last few pounds.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only over the counter diet aid that has worked for me.</li>
    <li> I have lost weight but this product has all kinds of scary side effects. You can definitely tell there is ephedra in there. I am in my early 30 and very active and ive never had any heart issues, but when i take this i get palpitations, headaches, and some nausea... But it works most of the time by controling cravings and appetite in general.</li>
    <li> I tried this product, I had very strong heart beat and I was very weak and that was trying one. I contacted the company and they informed me it&#x27;s non refundable. Please DON&#x27;T BUY IT. YOUR LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT USING THIS</li>
    <li> Well I started off w/ two tablets the first evening -- awfully excited I suppose-- I was very jittery and moody. Anyway, following day I went to the recommended dosage and so far it is ok for me. This evening my husband became fairly ill saying he was nauseous. I will admit it does leave me feeling a lil funny but hey, it diminishes my craving so I am not complaining. Also, I have been having this weird lingering headache. All signs I should stop but the symptoms are not enough for me to quit, they are all minor, literally, so I am okay. I am only a week into taking the pills so I am waiting for my body to fully adjust. I like that I have stopped snacking. I like it, not great but it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> ordered it oct. 26th...its nov 11th and it hasnt even been shipped yet.. whatever. the product itself it 4stars though.  order elsewhere.</li>
    <li> followed other reviewers info of cutting tabs in 1/2 first week...letting my body adjust...so take 1/2 in am &amp; 1/2 in afternoon for first week...into week 3 taking whole tab in am &amp; 1/2 tab in afternoon...lost 2 lbs/week with no exercise!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different appetite energy pills and none of them have ever really worked. But so far, I have been on this about a month and have been very happy with them. I only take 3 pills throughout the day and not any later than 3 or 4 pm or I can&#x27;t go to sleep. I also can&#x27;t take two at a time because they make me jittery. But I am not hungry and able to eat smaller portions and have some extra energy to get through my lists during the day! I also love there are so many in the bottle. They will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought these after trying a few others that didn&#x27;t seem to work. I was a little skeptical at first, but after reading reviews and seeing the rating of this diet pill I decided to buy them! I do NOT regret buying these and I will continue to buy more! They give you energy, keep you awake if you&#x27;re dragging, and suppress your appetite as described! LOVE these! My Mom even tried one and she loves them also! Great product and fast delivery!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been on this item for 2 days, and I&#x27;m already seeing results. I am the type of person who eats every 1-2 hours and I eat large portions at that. Within an hour of taking this pill, my appetite completely dissipated and this morning I had to force myself to eat a cup of yogurt! The only cons are the jittery feeling and the fact that it makes me thirsty, which isn&#x27;t really a con because it causes me to drink more water. The pros are the appetite suppressant and the energy boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only down 1.4 lbs, which I attribute to water weight, but that&#x27;s pretty good for 2 days! I will come back in a few weeks to let you all know if it&#x27;s still doing a good job.</li>
    <li> This product is not what i expected. I used to buy smaller bottles of this Lipodrene at a small local supplement &amp;vitamin store. I figured I would be getting a better deal with this since its 100 tabs for $22.&lt;br /&gt;The store sells 30 tab bottles for $15, and 100 tab bottles for $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipodrene (with 25mg ephedra) is really a great product I can drop up to 15 pounds in a month if I use it every day and exercise. It gives a burst of energy -great to use before working out and cuts appetite. ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get the right kind. The Lipodrene in the blue-labeled bottle is what I wanted and expected. When I received the package in the mail, it was completely different. Its still the Lipodrene brand but it had a black label and different features on the label. No Ephedra! It is just packed with caffeine it makes me feel hot dizzy nauseaus and extremely jittery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like this: [[ASIN:B005JMR11K Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals: Lipodrene (Yellow) 90 Tablet, ephedra-free]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ephedra blend better but that ingredient is highly regulated and hard to find. I guess I&#x27;ll just continue buying from the local store. I won&#x27;t buy this again!</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers said, this pill is very strong. I started today and took 1 pill around 6:30am, about 30 minutes later, I could really feel the pill working, which the directions on the bottle stated. You will feel it working soon after you take it. I should&#x27;ve eaten breakfast first. I think that&#x27;s why I really felt on the jittery side after taking the pill. I knew what to expect, so I wasn&#x27;t very surprised. I also felt on the warm side, and had alot of energy. Again, that&#x27;s what the pill is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now about 10am, and I&#x27;ve eaten breakfast about 2 hours ago. Normally at 10am I&#x27;m looking for a snack. I don&#x27;t feel the urge to snack AT ALL. Plus, I feel thirstier than normal, which is normal for these types of pills.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that if you don&#x27;t like feeling like this, then don&#x27;t buy this product. I&#x27;ve had much experience in these types of pills, so I knew what to expect. I do feel that will help with my snacking. That&#x27;s why I bought these. I haven&#x27;t worked out yet, but I know I will have to make sure that to take another pill a few hours before working out, because I know that I will feel like my heart is jumping out of my chest. It&#x27;s really about spacing them out. I plan on just starting with one pill in the morning and one pill at lunchtime and see how I feel at night.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to see how much more weight I will lose using this pill. I currently am on Weight Watchers.</li>
    <li> I just started taking these on Saturday, it is now Monday. I have only taken one a day, and have lost 4 lbs so far. I worked out last night (25 min workout video) and ate a small dinner (4 slices of brisket and a small serving of beans.) My only complaint is I get really hot and my heart pounds a little more than it should I feel like. I am 5&#x27;2&#x27;&#x27; and weight 130 lbs. My goal is 115. I am hoping to be there in no time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for the past few months. Ever since last new year&#x27;s resolution I&#x27;ve decided to turn my fast food gut into a more healthy living style. This is a great supplement to restore the body, and to detoxify it I use [[ASIN:B00801KAVK Blue-green Algae]]. The combination of this and the blue green algae (it balances my blood sugar which ive always had problems with plus some other benefits) proved much more effective to me then when I was using this alone.</li>
    <li> I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
    <li> product seems to work with no after jitters and no side effects and really amps up your workouts and curbs some appeities when taken daily</li>
    <li> LOVE this!Yes you sweat more, and your heart races sometimes, you feel a little anxiety, but it works! Lost 15lbs so far, with little effort. I take one a day, early in the am.</li>
    <li> HAd to start off with smaller dose and build up the first week. I have energy all day, which has not been normal for me! love it</li>
    <li> They were right when they said it makes your heart race. I&#x27;ve just started them today though taking it with something else but my heart started racing after taking one tablet. Reduced after about 20mins or so. Will update this review as time goes on to see how effective they are.</li>
    <li> Started taking these pills 4 weeks ago and I am down 10lbs.  It took a few days to build up my tolerance taking 1/2 a dose at first but then once I got use to them, I was able to take them as directed.  Taking them with food is best for me.  What I really like besides the weight loss is the effect they have had on my A.D.D. at work.  I am far more focused and feel less overwhelmed when I take these pills.  What a great product.  Please remember to add fiber to your diet...</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was personally trying to get a prescription for phentermine because my friend had a grey outcome with it after pregnancy and looks great and I still not shedding the pounds after a year later became desperate by side I couldn&#x27;t get my hands on it I had to resort to this and I am glad I did. Losing a lb a day, I eat less and I have no hunger pains whatsoever. I seriously do recommend this product. When I bought this I read most of the reviews some said u feel jittery and all I do not, never did. I take two in the morn and one in the afternoon around 2. This is my third day I&#x27;m looking to lose 35-40 lbs so far down 4 lol</li>
    <li> This is the first day I have taken them, and I was scared to take them after reading the reviews. I received the blue bottle with ephedra. I was hesitant to take an entire pill, but I did. That was about 6 hours ago and I have not been jittery or had the desire to run around in circles. I&#x27;m still about half asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how well the appetite suppressant is working since I haven&#x27;t had much of an appetite on my diet, but I can say that I have not been hungry today. Here is a little about me to help others determine how it will affect them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6&#x27; - 241 lbs&lt;br /&gt;For the last 10 years I have lived on Diet Dr Pepper(This may be why the caffeine had little affect)&lt;br /&gt;Started diet and exercise about 3 weeks ago&lt;br /&gt;I eat 800 calories or less per day, and fast once a week(mainly spinach, flounder, and granola bars)&lt;br /&gt;I run half a mile, do push-ups, and do sit-ups about 3-5 times a week&lt;br /&gt;I do not intake any caffeine&lt;br /&gt;I take multivitamins every morning&lt;br /&gt;I dropped from 257 to 241 in the last 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mainly taking this to increase my metabolism. I have not noticed an increased heart beat or had any jitters. I did notice that I did not get cold at work today. I typically wear my coat at work, but did not today. I will continue taking it to see if it helps. I took it with a glass of grapefruit juice, granola bar, and my daily multivitamins.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and a new mother of an 8 month baby. I weigh 180 lbs thanks to pregnancy!!! :( I want to slim down to 140, my original weight. After all my research, and the decision to stop nursing my baby, I began to take these yesterday. I take one at 8 AM and one at 2 PM. So far, I feel great! I have more energy to workout and I am not hungry! Woot woot! I&#x27;m super encouraged by all the reviews, so I am convinced I will lose 40 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will deff come back to update my progress soon! :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with my weight for a couple of years. When I graduated high school i was close to 300 pounds and after finally getting my butt into gear I was able to get myself down to 210 and then the weight just STOPPED coming off. I finally gave in and decided I would try this, seeing as there were so many good reviews. I received my order three days ago and started taking them the day after. Its been two days and I&#x27;ve already lost 4 pounds! My goal is to reach 150 pounds so hopefully this keeps up and I will reach my goal in no time. This is the only thing that has worked for me in about a year but PLEASE read the rest of this review before you buy the product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You NEED to EAT SOMETHING before or after you take the pills. When I took my first pill, I began to feel nauseous after about 20 minutes, but I ate some toast and jam and it went away soon after that. I&#x27;ve found that drinking water or milk also helps keep the nausea away throughout the day. This is NOT a pill that can be taken without food in your stomach!!! You WILL get sick. Also, it gives me headaches every now and then but this too goes away when you eat something. I suggest you keep something to snack on, with you at all times, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT DRINK ANYTHING WITH CAFFEINE AS LONG AS YOU&#x27;RE ON THIS PRODUCT! The pills alone make you VERY jittery and shaky. I can hardly hold my hands still as I&#x27;m typing this. Also, if you have HEART PROBLEMS DO NOT BUY THIS!! There are times throughout the day that I can feel my heart racing like I just ran a couple miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the boost of energy, I haven&#x27;t felt it yet. In fact, it makes me want to take naps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be VERY careful with this product. This product is ONLY for people who need to lose a lot of weight. This is not to be taken lightly. For all you younger girls who think they&#x27;re fat because of magazines and bullies, PLEASE try a healthier diet and some exercise before you even THINK about buying this product. Yes, it works, but pills should be a last resort.t. Yes, it works, but pills should be a last resort.</li>
    <li> This product DOES help with appetite suppressant.  If you don&#x27;t have much in your system it will make you a jittery mess though.  As long as I take it after I have eaten it does a good job.  I love phentermine (Rx) and this is a similar product.  I have never taken more than one pill in a day due to the jittery effect though.  Worth a try if you need to curb your appetite.</li>
    <li> If I had known about this product years ago, I could have saved myself alot of time , money &amp; grief. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a couple months now, usually when i find a diet pill that actually gives me results the effects wear off and my body gets use to them within a few weeks, but i have been using these for 2 months now and am still getting results. LOVE IT. This does exactly what it says, it is a wonderful appetite suppressant, you take these in the morning and you will forget to eat for the rest of the day lol and they wake you right up and give you tons of energy- I always feel like going for a run when I&#x27;m on these. Great price great results, they may speed up your heart rate and give you the shakes more than what would be comfortable, but who cares! They work so good!</li>
    <li> I feel the gitters, goose bumps, heart palpitation peaking in 2 hours and lasting 8 hours. So make sure you are working out to release your  energy.</li>
    <li> Hi Tech Lipodrene has been working wonders for me.... I&#x27;ve been taking it for about 1.5 week and I feel Awesome all day.. I take one at 5:30am just before my morning workout...and my 2nd one after lunch which is around 1pm. I feel so ENERGIZED ALL DAY with out any Jitters! It curbs my appetite completely but of course I still eat.. Just a lot healthier! 2 Thumbs up to HI-TECH LIPODRENE!!</li>
    <li> First, be careful when starting these.  They are STRONG so don&#x27;t take them after 2pm, only take one for the first few days, and don&#x27;t be shocked if you body gets redness or does other odd things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this stuff works a good deal better than anything else i&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m buying a few more bottles right now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to drink plenty of water and force yourself to eat small snacks even if you don&#x27;t feel hungry.</li>
    <li> i have been waiting for my order for almost 3 weeks and still havent received anything, im very annoyed and dont know if i will be ordering again</li>
    <li> I had very high expectations after reading some reviews. I normally drink a lot of coffee, so I was fine with taking a whole pill breakfast and lunch the first day. After 30 minutes,  I immediately got a burst of energy. But after five hours or so, it sometimes makes me very tired. As for appetite suppressant, it&#x27;s half the pill and half your will power. This isn&#x27;t going to magically slap your hand from grabbing your comfort food when it&#x27;s in front of you, but it does make you not get cravings. In the first week I lost about 4 pounds, which is just okay considering I&#x27;ve changed my diet to unprocessed foods only and been doing yoga. I will probably start cycling by water fasting on weekends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a lipodrene fan for many years, although I have to take breaks between bottles because my body seems to become immune after a couple months of continuous use.  This little yellow pill certainly does the trick of suppressing my appetite and keeping me going for my long days at work with enough energy for a workout in the evenings.  I only take one in the mornings and never after 10am or I&#x27;ll be up all night.  A little jittery at first, but nothing to make me nauseous.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a health nut and a gym rat who takes many different vitamins/supplements religiously.  This is one of the best I&#x27;ve found!  Boosts energy, suppresses appetite and burns fat.  Bought it because it was one the few I could find that still had ephedra in it (THE MOST EFFECTIVE INGREDIENT FOR WEIGHT LOSS PERIOD) and hoodia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside to someone not used to taking diet pills is how strong they are...definitely do not take if you have high blood pressure or any type of heart ailment.  If your healthy, active and want to give your body an extra kick start...I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I remember taking a product with Ephedra and losing 30 lbs in 3 months years ago before they took ephedra products off the market. After my second child I&#x27;ve had a hard time getting the weight off. Being in a Caribbean family where there are carbs, carbs and MORE carbs, I had a hard time getting it off even more. I had to change my eating habits, drinking habits (limiting my alcohol consumption to at least 1 beer per week instead of 3), and my sugar intake (sweets are yummy, but not EVERYDAY), and substitute FRUIT and veggies in there for the mini donuts and cakes that I crave often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s a life change but with this yellow pill and more focus on yourself, you will achieve it. I have been taking Lipodrene for 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m 8lbs down. This is only the beginning. It suppresses my appetite perfectly and it allows me to sleep well still. I take it around 8:30 in the mornings when I get into work on an empty stomach but a good two tall cups of water. Then I eat maybe a piece of fruit or toast with a little jelly by 10:00 in the morning. I eat lunch between 12:oo noon and 12:30, and then I take another one after lunch or if I forget, I take in the 4:00 hour.  I have energy and I&#x27;m not jittery. I took two at the same time last week and I did experience jitters, so I don&#x27;t recommend it if you plan on sitting at a desk to work like I do. If you plan on using energy to run it off, then take the two but make sure you drink 4x the water that you would drink if you only took one. Drink 2x the water (2 cups) you would normally drink for taking a pill, because it has the ephedra and needs to flush out your system and helps you urinate off the fat and toxins. You want this pill to help you burn fat but you wanna cleanse too, all day everyday, so get your gallon cases of water and keep water near you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  That&#x27;s my testimony. Lipodrene has given me the energy I miss about myself. It&#x27;s been 4 yrs since I had a baby and I&#x27;ve been down on myself about my weight. I&#x27;m happy that I have this product and I plan to take it now (October 2012) until March of 2013, and I hope to see maximum results by the Spring of 2013!!! I&#x27;ll take a pic!!</li>
    <li> This product claims to have the best ingredients for powerful weight loss.  They warn that you shouldn&#x27;t use the product unless you&#x27;re trying to lose weight.  They warn against caffeine consumption due to the \\&quot;energy\\&quot; you&#x27;ll receive from the pills.  Well, hate to tell you all...it&#x27;s all a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on this product for a month now and I&#x27;ve not loss one pound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with one pill in the morning due to reviews that stated you&#x27;d get heart palpitations.  I felt nothing, not even a speeding heart rate.  Upped my dosage to two pills, then all the way to four pills (the maximum the bottle allows) and I still felt nothing.  I don&#x27;t drink caffeine.  I don&#x27;t even drink soda or coffee, so in reality this product should have had me wired.  Just to experiment, I got a coffee from Sheets.  The caffeine in the COFFEE had me more awake than the pills that claimed to have more caffeine that an 8oz cup of joe.  For me, the claimed of increased energy aren&#x27;t holding up in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one has spoke about the fact that these pills are difficult to swallow, at least none of the reviews I&#x27;ve read at the time I purchased.  They are shaped in a manner that unless you&#x27;re gulping water intensely, you&#x27;re going to get a pill lodged in your throat or worse....feel the thing the whole way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that this product DOES do...appetite suppression.  I felt less hungry taking these pills and filled up faster.  That is the only reason I would ever repurchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, does it burn fat?  Does it give energy?  Does it speed up your metabolism?  Does it cause weight loss?  Not in my experience.</li>
    <li> I have heard many good things about this product, I have only used it for a few days so I am not sure if it is good or not.</li>
    <li> This really helped me lose the extra weight I needed to lose, in the short amount of time I had.</li>
    <li> Great product, keep me concentrated the whole day and therefore productivity increased a lot. I only see a slightly lowing my food appetite,but I did observe more clearance from body. Overall, I did lost 15 lb so far (15 lb more to go) due to the combination of this bottle, cutting food portion and extensive excercises. The only minor side effect is that it caused a little bit faster heart rate for 30 min after you took it, that&#x27;s it.</li>
