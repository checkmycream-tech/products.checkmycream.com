      <li>Great product.</li>

      <li>I love this lipgloss!</li>
      <li>The color, texture, smell and taste are all absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>So amazing and minty.</li>
      <li>However, the problem I have with the mint flavoring, which I admit is entirely my own issue, it that I eat the gloss off of my lips and end up with chapped lips.</li>
      <li>Slaphappy is the shade I purchased, and it&#x27;s a light/neutral peachy/pink that would probably look good on most people.</li>
      <li>it tastes ok, but it feels so good.</li>
      <li>so at first after reading the reviews, i thought well this product sounds too good to be true, but it wasn&#x27;t!!!</li>
      <li>it is very light and shiny.</li>
      <li>i love the fact that it has mint</li>
      <li>But I love it.</li>
      <li>My favorite part is the mint flavor.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>

      <li>:)</li>
      <li>and they tingle with a light mint flavor-!</li>
      <li>Nice pretty colored lip gloss.</li>
      <li>I received my item rather quickly. :-)</li>
      <li>It is the perfect match for pale girls like myself.</li>
      <li>This is a nice basic color that will suit most skin colors.</li>
      <li>The lipgloss is great as long as you don&#x27;t want a whole lot of color, the lipgloss gave me a lot of shine and fresh breath!</li>
      <li>I thought it would be more pink but its a very light gloss.</li>
      <li>I think the color is pretty true to the appearance in the posted photo on amazon&#x27;s site.</li>
      <li>So if you are fine with the mint, this is a nice little gloss.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not heavy, and it&#x27;s really minty which i love.</li>
      <li>Perfect for simple everyday on the go wear.</li>
      <li>The item arrived very fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good if you want just a little color or over a darker lip color.</li>
      <li>The minty tingling sensation does not bother me its really helps your breath become fresh.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and exactly as shown and described.</li>
      <li>So if you like a little fun lipgloss that you can feel the freshness of, I suggest this one for you! :)</li>
      <li>I expected more color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty intense, so if you don&#x27;t like mint, steer clear!</li>
      <li>highly recommended</li>
      <li>so I have really nothing negative to say about it other than its great.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t surprised of the light peachy pink color it has</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not too dark and not too light.  </li>
      <li>It looks natural in color on my lips, but gives em a shine and plump.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not thick or sticky or anything gross like that.  </li>

    <li> My favorite lipgloss.  It looks natural in color on my lips, but gives em a shine and plump.  My skin is fair/freckled.  It also has a minty feeling to it.  It is very hard to find this color and type/brand now unfortunately.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I expected more color. Said in a few words: it&#x27;s just a transparent (no color) lip gloss with minty sensation.</li>
    <li> I received my item rather quickly. :-) I absolutely love it. The color, texture, smell and taste are all absolutely amazing. A must get!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and exactly as shown and described. Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this lipgloss 2 days ago and it just came! I wasn&#x27;t expecting that great of service! The lipgloss is great as long as you don&#x27;t want a whole lot of color, the lipgloss gave me a lot of shine and fresh breath! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> i love the fact that it has mint so my lip doesn&#x27;t crack</li>
    <li> I like this lipgloss a lot because it&#x27;s the perfect texture, it&#x27;s not thick or sticky or anything gross like that.  It looks and feels great on me. It&#x27;s mint and it feels like burtsbees. Not to mention the smell!!! :) So amazing and minty. So if you like a little fun lipgloss that you can feel the freshness of, I suggest this one for you! :) Great buy!!</li>
    <li> It looks like it promised. It took awhile to get here. It did come eventually on time. My main issue is the seal was broken. The lip-gloss looked like it had been used. I had to open the entire thing, and hope my sister doesn&#x27;t notice. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice pretty colored lip gloss. Wasn&#x27;t surprised of the light peachy pink color it has when I received it I was expecting it to look that why. Perfect for simple everyday on the go wear. The minty tingling sensation does not bother me its really helps your breath become fresh. Have other shades of this gloss so I have really nothing negative to say about it other than its great.</li>
    <li> Love the minty flavor with a hint of color!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be more pink but its a very light gloss. It&#x27;s good if you want just a little color or over a darker lip color. I have to say, it&#x27;s minty.</li>
    <li> This is a nice basic color that will suit most skin colors. However, the problem I have with the mint flavoring, which I admit is entirely my own issue, it that I eat the gloss off of my lips and end up with chapped lips. So if you are fine with the mint, this is a nice little gloss. If you tend to lick your lips if you have a flavored product on them, then you might want to pass.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lip gloss.  It&#x27;st he perfect shade, it&#x27;s not too dark and not too light.  It is the perfect match for pale girls like myself.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my mother. She loved it!</li>
    <li> I love this, but I hate that I can&#x27;t get it all out. The stick is too small to reach the bottom or sides.</li>
    <li> I love this lipgloss! Slaphappy is the shade I purchased, and it&#x27;s a light/neutral peachy/pink that would probably look good on most people. I think the color is pretty true to the appearance in the posted photo on amazon&#x27;s site. Has a good consistency, not too sticky. My favorite part is the mint flavor. It&#x27;s pretty intense, so if you don&#x27;t like mint, steer clear! But I love it.</li>
    <li> so at first after reading the reviews, i thought well this product sounds too good to be true, but it wasn&#x27;t!!! it tastes ok, but it feels so good. it&#x27;s not heavy, and it&#x27;s really minty which i love. but that is of course a preference thing. it&#x27;s also not too &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; color wise. it&#x27;s great for just going to school. highly recommended</li>
    <li> Not that minty and the container came in the mail a sticky mess.  Since the seal was still on, I washed it and gave it a try...and then gave it to my sister who doesn&#x27;t mind gooey lip gloss.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and it is perfect for her. It was the perfect color and she was able to use it as soon as she got it.</li>
    <li> this is a great affordable product-! makes your lips so shiny and they tingle with a light mint flavor-! great color!</li>
    <li> I love this lip gloss! it is very light and shiny. The item arrived very fast. I will certanly order again with this company!!</li>
