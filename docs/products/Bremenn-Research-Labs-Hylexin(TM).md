      <li>it worked for me, and I&#x27;m so very happy.</li>
      <li>However, I did find comfort that has been the best thing ever in the office of an ENT/plastic surgeon.</li>
      <li>Of all the products I have tried, Olay Regenerist eye cream works the best.</li>
      <li>I look great!</li>
      <li>I bought it thinking if it works great,</li>
      <li>The cream is great.</li>
      <li>Worked great for a week</li>
      <li>and I were happy with how things have progressed.</li>
      <li>Worked great for a week</li>
      <li>I have had great results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Hylexin for 2 months and am thrilled with the difference!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I waited!</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this product at Sephora and honestly did not expect it to work.  </li>
      <li>Drank more water, got a tan, even threw in some vitamins for good measure.</li>
      <li>then it kind of stopped.</li>
      <li>then it kind of stopped.</li>
      <li>honestly its been amazing.i</li>
      <li>I would suggest anyone who is looking for an effective cream give this product a shot.</li>
      <li>The puffiness is what bothered me most.  </li>
      <li>but I believe in most cases this is not the culprit.</li>
      <li>If yours are from lack of sleep, get more sleep.</li>
      <li>I would have paid sooo much more for these results.</li>
      <li>and I swear it keeps getting better.  </li>
      <li>As I continue to use it, it seems to be getter better and better.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Look the creme works, but it is nothing close to what drinking more water and eating more healthy does.</li>
      <li>I have a biology degree and work in healthcare sales, so I have a strong connection to the sciences, specifically anatomy.</li>
      <li>They did not totally go away after using Hylexin, but they faded a great deal.  </li>
      <li>I got this product for free to start, so I did not spend $95 for it.  </li>
      <li>in part because I wanted to see what I had gotten for free...</li>
      <li>I guess everyone&#x27;s different, but I&#x27;ve been quite happy with the product.</li>
      <li>I started out with a half-size product from a combo trial pack, and I liked it so much that I&#x27;ve bought the full size product now.  </li>
      <li>and I saw more results in terms of wrinkles and under eye puffiness in the first two weeks than I am seeing with hylexin.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately I bought it at Costco for $65, so am not out the full $95.  </li>
      <li>I am very fair so this might work better on people with fair skin, as several of the negative reviewers seem to have had darker skin.  </li>
      <li>Ok, so, are you ready to hear what may help?  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work for me at all, and I even gave it the full 30 days...</li>
      <li>Go to a dermatologist and they will set you up with a plan that will give much faster and better results.</li>
      <li>Also, you need to follow the instructions exactly!</li>
      <li>I have had dark circles for many, many years.  </li>
      <li>I have really fair skin and have always had dark circles.</li>
      <li>No amount of sleep, eat well, or generally good lifestyle choices changed my dark circles.  </li>
      <li>After trying to discover a better way, I went to a dermatologist and they told me I need to drink more water something like 45 to 65 ounces a day, and that would help, and sure enough the water helped a lot more than this silly cream.</li>
      <li>was pretty hesitant to try it out, since, woah...</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I was able to get a refund through my local Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>This was also about 3 years ago, so it is very possible things have progressed to reflect a better technology.</li>
      <li>I used it exactly per the instructions.</li>
      <li>I feel like I look a lot better after using the product for several months.  </li>
      <li>After the first two weeks I didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been three weeks now and they are much lighter!  </li>
      <li>and I am sure, won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
      <li>(I was lucky enough to get a free sample at Sephora)and</li>
      <li>For me, this product has really helped the appearance of my dark circles, but more importantly it has helped my puffy eyes,</li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to have Macy&#x27;s give me a full refund for the unused portion of the tube without any</li>
      <li>but after awhile it would cake under my eyes, dry out and make my lines more visible and really made me look older!</li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work.  </li>
      <li>Like anything, really, won&#x27;t work for 100% of people.  </li>
      <li>I believe the only thing might reduce them is surgery if available.  </li>
      <li>and I see absolutely nothing-no reduction in under eye circles or in puffiness.  </li>
      <li>While it does seem to help a bit, it is not as promising as one might consider paying a 100 bucks for.</li>
      <li>It might not take it away completely, but it sure has faded enough that I can now use a concealer (or just a fuller coverage foundation!) and not have to worry about it fading or caking.</li>
      <li>I just get a cool tingly feeling under my eyes and a sort of placebo-induced, hopeful-deluded ephoria come over me - a fantasy that I will wake up the next morning ring-free.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m an extremely fair Scandinavian-Irish gal with the same dark eye-circle genetics!</li>
      <li>I definitely plan on doing more in the future.</li>
      <li>As I got older (Im 38 now)</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>It may take a few treatments, but lasers are being used in many instances to treat all types of skin issues.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a try for people with similar problems to mine.  </li>
      <li>It instantly gets absorbed  after application</li>
      <li>was actually pretty discouraged because I didn&#x27;t see a change, but then BAM, in the 3rd week of using it, I woke up and my circles were soooo much noticably lighter.</li>
      <li>BEST RESULTS were on the puffiness under my eyes, which had gotten much worse since I got a little older.  </li>
      <li>I still have doubts on this cream totally brightening my skin tone around my eyes, but never the less I find it effective.</li>
      <li>I used to test cosmetics for a consumer evaluation company in New York.</li>
      <li>advertising for this so called miracle cure should have been the first red flag</li>
      <li>&quot; Let that be a lesson to all of us, do some basic research first, before throwing away money on garbage.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t mentioned in the ad but the clerk there told me I wasn&#x27;t the first to ask for my money back</li>
      <li>I have tried many different products for reducing dark circles under my eyes and so far nothing works.</li>
      <li>I am atill young and getting my footing out there in the career world, so I can&#x27;t afford now to have laser treatments to help me.</li>
      <li>so far I see no change.  </li>
      <li>Maybe our true stength as women (or men) with dark circles will come from our acceptance of our rings and not from a $95 scam.</li>
      <li>I am Italian and Greek and there isn&#x27;t anything that will erase heredity and that is what most dark under eye circles are caused by.</li>
      <li>The packaging looks so professional and the cost was high enough that it gave the impression of a valuable product.</li>
      <li>It looks as if someone used black paint under the eyes of the model and then the after picture is perfect and they insinuate their product made the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company that markets this useless cream is called \\&quot;Basic Research.\\</li>
      <li>I get enough sleep, eat fairly decent and drink tons of water</li>
      <li>Some went on smooth but the coverage didnot last and by mid-day there were those dark circles again.</li>
      <li>considering my condition i still have light dark circles left and hope this cream will continue to benefit me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had them since as far back as I can remember.</li>
      <li>Apparently, it does not work for everyone, but it has worked for me.</li>
      <li>I could never find a product geared specifically toward addressing dark circles, so I became an avid concealer user.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard being so young and having dark circles under your eyes, but now I  look more my age.</li>
      <li>Since it has only been two weeks, I am willing to try it a bit longer since other&#x27;s have told me it takes several weeks.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried just about everything out there on the market to get rid of my dark circles. I had high hopes for this product. I read all the media hype and research docs and it looked like the miracle cure I had been waiting for. So I shelled out the $100.00 and guess what? It does not work. I am so disappointed.  &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product at Sephora and honestly did not expect it to work.  I tried it once a day (at night) for a week and saw a visible difference.  It&#x27;s been three weeks now and they are much lighter!  I still need concealer but I swear I look 5 years younger!  I will continue to use this product as it&#x27;s been the only one that has worked for me....try it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this very expensive cream for about two weeks and I see absolutely nothing-no reduction in under eye circles or in puffiness.  Since it has only been two weeks, I am willing to try it a bit longer since other&#x27;s have told me it takes several weeks.  I will say that I was previously using Roc eye cream which costs about a third of this product and I saw more results in terms of wrinkles and under eye puffiness in the first two weeks than I am seeing with hylexin.  I don&#x27;t think it is the miracle they claim and I personally won&#x27;t be buying anymore and wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone pay the money for it.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to start, so I did not spend $95 for it.  I had no expectations about how well it would work.  My problem: slight darkness under my eyes and puffiness.  The puffiness is what bothered me most.  I have read lot of reviews..in part because I wanted to see what I had gotten for free...so I know there are mixed reviews.  For me, this product has really helped the appearance of my dark circles, but more importantly it has helped my puffy eyes, both in appearance and in that puffy feeling.  I have only been using it for a week.  Apparently, it does not work for everyone, but it has worked for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hylexin for a short time and I have already noticed the changes in my orbital area.  The darkness has decreased quite a bit. The reduction of puffiness is a bit slower.  I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in week 4 of using this product faithfully, as is my daughter.  Zero results.  Fortunately I bought it at Costco for $65, so am not out the full $95.  But don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> I have horrible bags and deep creases along edge of preorbital area. Of all the products I have tried, Olay Regenerist eye cream works the best. Also my plastic surgeon said that part of the dark purple is my muscle showing thru because I have excess skin but no fat in periorbital area. He said he will inject fat from my rear(plenty) and that will lessen the color, and after he removes excess skin, he will use laser.</li>
    <li> have had dark circles caused by pigmentation for four years and have tried everything.have been using hylexin for just five days and honestly its been amazing.i saw all the bad reviews and im glad they didnt stop me.for the first time in years i dont need a concealer.will continue to keep you posted as i hope in the nxt week or two not to have any circles at all.(if it continues this way) i think mayb the product doesnt work for hereditery circles.</li>
    <li> I wholeheartedly agree with the Greek-Italian woman who said this product doesn&#x27;t work...and I&#x27;m an extremely fair Scandinavian-Irish gal with the same dark eye-circle genetics! Please don&#x27;t waste any time going to the store to buy this product--you will need to make a second trip to return it within 30 days! I used to test cosmetics for a consumer evaluation company in New York. So when I bought this product, I tested it only on my left eye for 3 weeks, 3 times a day. There wasn&#x27;t the SLIGHTEST change! I think that the women who claimed to see a change probably used it on both eyes and were probably being hopeful. When I returned it to Bloomingdale&#x27;s, the saleswoman suggested that I just didn&#x27;t have the genetics for it to work on me. Hah! Well, then, who was this product developed for, if not for the women with dark eye circles????</li>
    <li> Hi, ladies. I have not used this product, but I am one of those gals who does alot of research before she steps into anything. I have a biology degree and work in healthcare sales, so I have a strong connection to the sciences, specifically anatomy. Although I am not a doctor, researcher/scientist, or someone who claims to have all the answers, I can offer my input based on my experiences. I am a victim, as it appears many of you are, of bad genes when it comes to the periorbital area. I had bags by the age of 12 that never went away, and the redness under my eyes was visible in pictures taken of me in kindergarten. Yup. It was ugly. I too tried creams, from lighteners, to vitamin K solutions, to plain &#x27;ole cucumbers. Drank more water, got a tan, even threw in some vitamins for good measure. Nothing got rid of them. Listen to me carefully: genetics sucks! However, I did find comfort that has been the best thing ever in the office of an ENT/plastic surgeon. He told me the along the same stuff that hylexin is claiming is the cause for the circles, but, hylexin is claiming leakage from the vessels is the cause. Judging by what the doc said, I don&#x27;t feel this to be the case. The cause of the circles is two-fold: a) superficiality of the underlying capillaries and b) the skin of the periorbital area is some of the thinnest on the body. These two things together causes the red pigmentation. Sometimes circles can be from hyperpigmentation, often from sun exposure and the same as any other \\&quot;sunspot,\\&quot; but I believe in most cases this is not the culprit. Take a look at your cirlces anyway...pull the skin up and you can tell it is super thin. Ok, so, are you ready to hear what may help?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lasers. It may take a few treatments, but lasers are being used in many instances to treat all types of skin issues. Lasers in this case, as the doc informed me, can cause the superficial vessels to collapse so that they are not as visible at the skin&#x27;s surface, leading to the disintegration of the pigment. This technology is already being employed in the case of spider veins. I am atill young and getting my footing out there in the career world, so I can&#x27;t afford now to have laser treatments to help me. However, I have had two treatments in the past, and I can say doc and I were happy with how things have progressed. This was also about 3 years ago, so it is very possible things have progressed to reflect a better technology. I know when I was doing it, I was a test subject for him anyway. I definitely plan on doing more in the future. Hope this helped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles (I mean really dark circles) under my eyes for years... looked like a tired racoon. Saw the mixed reviews, but figured with a money back guarentee I&#x27;d try it. Worked great for a week then it kind of stopped. Used it for another two weeks and all of a sudden my dark circles were gone. I love this stuff. I look great! Don&#x27;t look tired anymore. And I&#x27;m not the only one who loves it. After my sister saw my results she started using it as well. The same thing happened. Worked great for a week then it kind of stopped. Used it for another two weeks and all of a sudden her dark circles were gone. Now I use it 2 or 3 times a week. I would recommend it to anyone who has serious dark circles or puffiness.</li>
    <li> Hylexin states that it is for serious black circles under the eye. While it does seem to help a bit, it is not as promising as one might consider paying a 100 bucks for. After trying to discover a better way, I went to a dermatologist and they told me I need to drink more water something like 45 to 65 ounces a day, and that would help, and sure enough the water helped a lot more than this silly cream. Look the creme works, but it is nothing close to what drinking more water and eating more healthy does. Go to a dermatologist and they will set you up with a plan that will give much faster and better results. But all in all this product is not that bad and more a less an expensive cosmetic creme, worth trying, but won&#x27;t really change anything. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This item is listed in more than one place but the bad reviews did not follow.  You can read my other reviews to see the additional listing before you decide to buy this. They have changed the name from Basic Research too.  I am repeating my previous statements here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advertising for this so called miracle cure should have been the first red flag but somehow I believed this just might work. It doesn&#x27;t and it angers me to know I fell for the hype. The packaging looks so professional and the cost was high enough that it gave the impression of a valuable product. It isn&#x27;t. I am Italian and Greek and there isn&#x27;t anything that will erase heredity and that is what most dark under eye circles are caused by. If yours are from lack of sleep, get more sleep. It they&#x27;re from allergies, take Claritin but don&#x27;t throw away $100.00 plus on this tube of nothing. It is not worth the money and can&#x27;t do what is promised. Please, just judge this product by the advertising picture. It looks as if someone used black paint under the eyes of the model and then the after picture is perfect and they insinuate their product made the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company that markets this useless cream is called \\&quot;Basic Research.\\&quot; Let that be a lesson to all of us, do some basic research first, before throwing away money on garbage. Macy&#x27;s and Amazon should immediately pull this item. To do less would ruin the credibility of both companies, currently held in high regard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I was able to get a refund through my local Macy&#x27;s. This isn&#x27;t mentioned in the ad but the clerk there told me I wasn&#x27;t the first to ask for my money back and I am sure, won&#x27;t be the last. The fact they took it back locally speaks volumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...save your money and don&#x27;t fall for this one..it just doesn&#x27;t work!!</li>
    <li> I have really fair skin and have always had dark circles. I could never find a product geared specifically toward addressing dark circles, so I became an avid concealer user. I&#x27;ve been using Hylexin for 2 months and am thrilled with the difference!</li>
    <li> I have been using Hylexin since it came out on the market. I have had great results. My dark circles have lightened dramatically and in only a little over 2 weeks I had a noticeable difference.   &lt;br /&gt;Because of my results friends and relatives are now Hylexin users!!</li>
    <li> I paid $100.00 for a tube of Hylexin because I have serious dark circles.  Unfortunately, I fell for the hype because I would have tried anything that says, \\&quot;Significantly reduces dark circles!\\&quot;  I followed the directions and waited....NOTHING!  I teach Business Ehtics at a University.  Part of the course involves ethics in advertising.  I use the Hylexin example of how people are duped by the wording, the packaging, etc. &lt;br /&gt;Please take my word for it and save yourself some money!</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles my whole life.  I have bought and tried every type of concealer that is on the market. I get enough sleep, eat fairly decent and drink tons of water and I still have dark circles.  I read about Hylexin in a few magazines so I thought I would give it a try. I bought it thinking if it works great, if not, oh well.  So, I bought Hylexin at a department store about three months ago. After the first two weeks I didn&#x27;t see any change. I kept using it and after four weeks, I could see a visible change.   I am still using it and I swear it keeps getting better.  It&#x27;s expensive but it works. I would recommend Hylexin to any one with dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles for many, many years.  They did not totally go away after using Hylexin, but they faded a great deal.  I am very fair so this might work better on people with fair skin, as several of the negative reviewers seem to have had darker skin.  BEST RESULTS were on the puffiness under my eyes, which had gotten much worse since I got a little older.  The skin under my eyes no longer sags at all, and superficial wrinkles are definitely minimized.  I feel like I look a lot better after using the product for several months.  I started out with a half-size product from a combo trial pack, and I liked it so much that I&#x27;ve bought the full size product now.  It last forever, so it&#x27;s really not that expensive over time.  I think it&#x27;s worth a try for people with similar problems to mine.  I guess everyone&#x27;s different, but I&#x27;ve been quite happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll save you the details since the subject line states the facts.  After 4 weeks (2xday) and $95, nothing!  Once again, I wasted money for nothing.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product.  What a disappointment.  It didn&#x27;t work for me at all, and I even gave it the full 30 days... faithfully applying it two or three times a day.  I was lucky enough to have Macy&#x27;s give me a full refund for the unused portion of the tube without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I just have to face the fact that cover up make-up is the only way to hide the darkness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work.  I have serious dark circles under my eyes and have tried everything else.  But I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for two months and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement at all.  Not even a little.  In fact, my eyes might actually look worse.  It has not faded the dark circles, nor has it improved the bags.</li>
    <li> The cream is great. It instantly gets absorbed  after application and i believe helps over time close up leakage of blood capilleries (which causes black circle appearences). I suffered from chronic dark circles. This cream after 1 month of application has considerably lightened my dark circles and has reduced puffiness. I would suggest anyone who is looking for an effective cream give this product a shot. considering my condition i still have light dark circles left and hope this cream will continue to benefit me. I still have doubts on this cream totally brightening my skin tone around my eyes, but never the less I find it effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battled dark circles my whole life. I&#x27;ve become dependent on concealer to hide my circles and tried dozen of products all claiming to zap those rings away.  Nothing worked so I was hesitant when a friend insisted I try Hylexin.  I did.  Two weeks went by and I didn&#x27;t see a change.  I continued to use it faithfully.  I waited.  At about 4 weeks I started to notice a decrease in puffiness and diminshed dark circles.  At 5 weeks, the results were obvious -- to me, my family, and friends.  I&#x27;m glad I waited!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s painfully obvious that the PR people from Hylexin are writing phoney reviews on Amazon to balance out the bad rap that this product is getting from real people.  Their reviews are transparent and read like commercials.  Even their names seem fake - \\&quot;Elaine Christine\\&quot; and \\&quot;Heather\\&quot;!  Give me a break! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now (I was lucky enough to get a free sample at Sephora)and so far I see no change.  I just get a cool tingly feeling under my eyes and a sort of placebo-induced, hopeful-deluded ephoria come over me - a fantasy that I will wake up the next morning ring-free.  I&#x27;ve now looked at the Hylexin site and I see that even the before/after photos show no change in the women, simply a change in the lighting of the photo.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I agree with the reviewer who pointed out the sheer absurdity of the Hylexin model with black football marks under her eyes.  What a joke!  She is obviously not a woman with dark circles.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I found Hylexin&#x27;s website very insulting, filled with cheap shot attempts to make women with dark rings feel ugly and disparaged.  Maybe our true stength as women (or men) with dark circles will come from our acceptance of our rings and not from a $95 scam.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products for reducing dark circles under my eyes and so far nothing works. I am 33 and i really suffer from serious panda like dark circles. I heard from my sisters about Hylexin and I thought ok let me give it a try, since the ad says \\&quot;helps reduce SERIOUS dark circles\\&quot;. I have been using it for over a month, and nothing, no improvement at all. Besides it is kinda expensive too. One word, save your time and money. I believe the only thing might reduce them is surgery if available.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I fell for the hype and now am out quite a bit of money.......  Save your money, trust me!  I used this product 2-3 times a day until the entire tube was gone (took several months) and saw NO change whatsoever! I have serious dark circles, which is what it claims to help.  I am VERY disappointed with this company and their product and will never buy any item with their name on it again!  What a bunch of crap......</li>
    <li> Through luck of genetics, I have dark circles. I&#x27;ve had them since as far back as I can remember. No amount of sleep, eat well, or generally good lifestyle choices changed my dark circles.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was pretty hesitant to try it out, since, woah... $95 is a lot of money, but I gave it a shot. I used it exactly per the instructions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was actually pretty discouraged because I didn&#x27;t see a change, but then BAM, in the 3rd week of using it, I woke up and my circles were soooo much noticably lighter. I could cry. It&#x27;s hard being so young and having dark circles under your eyes, but now I  look more my age. And I&#x27;m still only in the 3rd week, so I have a lot of hope for the product.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I feel badly for the people who didn&#x27;t get a reaction, but as they state in their pamphlet, it will not work on 100% of people. Like anything, really, won&#x27;t work for 100% of people.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it worked for me, and I&#x27;m so very happy. I would have paid sooo much more for these results.</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles since I was young. As I got older (Im 38 now) it seemed to get darker. I am a makeup artist by profession, so believe me when I say that I have tried all kinds of concealers. Some went on smooth but the coverage didnot last and by mid-day there were those dark circles again. I literally had to carry concealer with me because I had to reapply atleast 3 times a day. The heavier concealers worked when I put them on but after awhile it would cake under my eyes, dry out and make my lines more visible and really made me look older! I was hesitant about Hylexin, like everyone, because of the price. I started using it but didnt see any results after few days. I guess it didnt help that I was constantly looking in the mirror.I started to get disappointed but kept on using it. I swear by the 3rd-4th week I could actually see a difference! My circles were way lighter and less noticeable! I dont have \\&quot;bags\\&quot; or puffiness, just dark circles and I have olive skin. As I continue to use it, it seems to be getter better and better. It might not take it away completely, but it sure has faded enough that I can now use a concealer (or just a fuller coverage foundation!) and not have to worry about it fading or caking. I feel bad that some people may not have gotten the results that they hoped for, but what do you have to loose! Yeah $95 is alot, but its cheaper and not as invasive as surgery. And it has the same 50/50 chance as cosmetic procedures. Everyones skin is different and reacts differently like any other skincare/cosmetics product. Also, you need to follow the instructions exactly! I applied twice a day and didnot skip any application. I tried very hard to stay out of the sun and used my same skincare routine. I will post another review in a few weeks and see if the circles improved anymore.  I hope this review has helped.</li>
    <li> I spent the $$$ for this supposed miracle product a month ago....don&#x27;t waste your money...absolutly NO results..</li>
