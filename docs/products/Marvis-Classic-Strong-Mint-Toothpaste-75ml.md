      <li>Wonderful flavor and gives you the freshest breath!</li>
      <li>Excellent toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I am so happy to have found it here!</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is the BEST!</li>
      <li>The best toothpaste!</li>
      <li>For the money, you&#x27;d think this would be an awesome minty experience.  </li>
      <li>Perfect travel sized.</li>
      <li>Delightful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great in all ways...</li>
      <li>Great product with nice packaging..</li>
      <li>/&gt;BS reviews don&#x27;t do this product any good as they increase one&#x27;s desire NOT to be a return</li>
      <li>Aquafresh ExtraFresh was a superior minty experience, before they messed up their formula by adding whitening and making it taste like chemicals.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best clean.</li>
      <li>Very refreshing.</li>
      <li>or maybe it&#x27;s just because I love the tube packaging?!  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste tastes nice</li>
      <li>Teeth do feel very clean afterwards!</li>
      <li>I found this toothpaste when I was traveling in Italy, not only is it a beautiful looking tube, the paste tastes great.</li>
      <li>The toothpaste is very nice, cool and refreshing.</li>
      <li>But, if you really want a nice tube of paste for your guest bathroom, or whatever, it&#x27;s very lovely, very strong.</li>
      <li>I do like the screw cap, much better than the flip and snap type.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite marvis flavor.</li>
      <li>toothpaste is probably my favorite toothpaste ever.</li>
      <li>It has a very strong taste but doesn&#x27;t foam up a lot if you need that to feel clean.</li>
      <li>The best toothpaste - have used this for years and would highly recommend - leaves breadth minty clean and fresh</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s super good and worth trying once if you are hesitant.</li>
      <li>Nothing &#x27;strong&#x27; about this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>In short, this toothpaste is still very good, worthy of recommendation.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mint taste is very natural, the toothpaste id really pleasant to taste and to use, and my teeth feel really clean after brushing with this.</li>
      <li>Great gag or white elephant gift.</li>
      <li>It makes my mouth feel clean and minty for hours after I brush.</li>
      <li>It was pleasant and enjoyed it, but it is not worth the price tag.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for free entertainment!</li>
      <li>So strong that is like anti-septic mouthwash the first time you use it.</li>
      <li>Always arrives quickly.</li>
      <li>mavis toothpaste has a refreshing mint taste that will leave your teeth squeaky clean with out the grittiness most other paste will have.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is necessarily worth the money, but it does have a kick and leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
      <li>I use it twice a day, and when I wake up in the morning, I&#x27;m still so fresh</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more and trying different flavors!</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this tooth paste in Italy and would always bring some back with me.</li>
      <li>Ok, so this is not product related......</li>
      <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Crushed Altoids&#x27; -really!?</li>
      <li>Overall, this product is nothing special and doesn&#x27;t warrant the higher price, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It was free 2nd air shipped, thanks to Amazon Prime, and the return address label said luxury4him, Las Vegas, NV.  </li>
      <li>Personally, I really like, I try to let my family, but some of them like it, some do not like it, it may be a matter of taste.</li>
      <li>i really tried.</li>
      <li>because, let&#x27;s be real, this is toothpaste and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of commentary.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, my special male friend just happened to be at my house when the package arrived.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this toothpaste, but at [...] bucks a tube, it&#x27;s not worth it for me anymore.</li>
      <li>I like it, but just decent.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have fluoride, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s so good in the long run.</li>
      <li>On top of that, this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t foam up at all, which makes it difficult to brush for a full two minutes.</li>
      <li>Based upon other reviews I thought I would try Marvis and see if it was worthy of the hype.</li>
      <li>Based on these reviews, I assumed this toothpaste would be much stronger than Crest, but the mint flavor is actually less intense than Crest.</li>
      <li>Once the tube is gone I&#x27;ll switch back to my old brand.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;m going to continue buying this, although if I don&#x27;t it will be because it is price prohibitive and because it&#x27;s evident that the premium price is due in some part to marketing and not the actual</li>
      <li>By the way I do mean squeaky clean too, your tooth brush will start squeaking on your teeth also there will be a noticeable whitening and build up reduction as well.</li>
      <li>I find typical toothpaste has a very chemical taste that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>

<li> It is a little stronger, but not what I expected with all the reviews.</li>
<li> Not worth the price.</li>
<li> I tried another flavor, and it had the same weird after taste.</li>
<li> I wish it was sold here instead of Crest, and all the other crappy American toothpastes! :(</li>
<li> that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m just crazy enough to spend $10.50 a tube...</li>
<li> not good for the price what you paid.....</li>
<li> But it is expensive.</li>
<li> It is expensive &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; toothpaste</li>
<li> bad mediciney after-taste.</li>

    <li> This toothpaste tastes nice but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have fluoride, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s so good in the long run. Once the tube is gone I&#x27;ll switch back to my old brand.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste, but at [...] bucks a tube, it&#x27;s not worth it for me anymore. I just get ultrabright! But, if you really want a nice tube of paste for your guest bathroom, or whatever, it&#x27;s very lovely, very strong. I wish it was sold here instead of Crest, and all the other crappy American toothpastes! :(</li>
    <li> not good for the price what you paid.....</li>
    <li> On a whim I decided to buy this toothpaste. I find typical toothpaste has a very chemical taste that I don&#x27;t care for. Based upon other reviews I thought I would try Marvis and see if it was worthy of the hype. It is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint taste is very natural, the toothpaste id really pleasant to taste and to use, and my teeth feel really clean after brushing with this. I think I&#x27;m going to continue buying this, although if I don&#x27;t it will be because it is price prohibitive and because it&#x27;s evident that the premium price is due in some part to marketing and not the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is probably my favorite toothpaste ever. But it is expensive.</li>
    <li> For the money, you&#x27;d think this would be an awesome minty experience.  It isn&#x27;t.  Aquafresh ExtraFresh was a superior minty experience, before they messed up their formula by adding whitening and making it taste like chemicals.  Nothing wrong with this per se, but nothing to justify paying 4-5x more than other brands.</li>
    <li> Imagine if Altoid&#x27;s mints were crushed/mixed into paste and squeezed into a tube. That&#x27;s Marvis toothpaste. In a word? Delightful.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this tooth paste in Italy and would always bring some back with me. I am so happy to have found it here!</li>
    <li> mavis toothpaste has a refreshing mint taste that will leave your teeth squeaky clean with out the grittiness most other paste will have. By the way I do mean squeaky clean too, your tooth brush will start squeaking on your teeth also there will be a noticeable whitening and build up reduction as well.</li>
    <li> Nothing &#x27;strong&#x27; about this toothpaste. Basic toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BS reviews don&#x27;t do this product any good as they increase one&#x27;s desire NOT to be a return customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Crushed Altoids&#x27; -really!?</li>
    <li> I found this toothpaste when I was traveling in Italy, not only is it a beautiful looking tube, the paste tastes great.</li>
    <li> I felt compelled to write this review to balance out all of overwhelmingly positive (fake?) reviews. Based on these reviews, I assumed this toothpaste would be much stronger than Crest, but the mint flavor is actually less intense than Crest. On top of that, this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t foam up at all, which makes it difficult to brush for a full two minutes. Overall, this product is nothing special and doesn&#x27;t warrant the higher price, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Try it.  I have all my friends hooked. It&#x27;s the best clean.</li>
    <li> Perfect travel sized. This is my favorite marvis flavor. It is expensive &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; toothpaste but it&#x27;s super good and worth trying once if you are hesitant.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my mouth feel clean and minty for hours after I brush.</li>
    <li> I think I just found my fav toothpaste! I will be ordering more and trying different flavors!</li>
    <li> Wonderful flavor and gives you the freshest breath!</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is very nice, cool and refreshing. Personally, I really like, I try to let my family, but some of them like it, some do not like it, it may be a matter of taste. In short, this toothpaste is still very good, worthy of recommendation.</li>
    <li> I seem to generate a lot of plaque despite brushing my teeth twice daily.  This toothpaste removes the plaque like none other that I have used.  Teeth do feel very clean afterwards!</li>
    <li> Marvis...where have you been all my life?!</li>
    <li> I wanted to experience brushing my teeth using the most expensive toothpaste.  It was pleasant and enjoyed it, but it is not worth the price tag.  I do like the screw cap, much better than the flip and snap type.  Great gag or white elephant gift.</li>
    <li> I like it, but just decent. Not worth the price. It is a little stronger, but not what I expected with all the reviews. Also, doesnt foam as much as regular toothpaste. I cant see me ordering again.</li>
    <li> Ok, so this is not product related......because, let&#x27;s be real, this is toothpaste and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of commentary.  It&#x27;s great in all ways...that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m just crazy enough to spend $10.50 a tube...or maybe it&#x27;s just because I love the tube packaging?!  Who knows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my special male friend just happened to be at my house when the package arrived.  It was free 2nd air shipped, thanks to Amazon Prime, and the return address label said luxury4him, Las Vegas, NV.  Let your imagination run for awhile.  Yes, my male friend got a little crazed wondering what on Earth I could have ordered from this business name!  I couldn&#x27;t help tease him.....before finally confessing it was just toothpaste.  Thanks for free entertainment!</li>
    <li> It has a very strong taste but doesn&#x27;t foam up a lot if you need that to feel clean. I don&#x27;t know if it is necessarily worth the money, but it does have a kick and leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste - have used this for years and would highly recommend - leaves breadth minty clean and fresh</li>
    <li> So strong that is like anti-septic mouthwash the first time you use it. Even though it doesn&#x27;t talk about it, I used it for about two weeks and a co-worker asked if I had been whitening my teeth! Long lasting freshness, can&#x27;t wait to try other Marvis flavors!</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste! I&#x27;ve converted my husband who was a long time cinnamon lover to this mint toothpaste. Always arrives quickly.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is the BEST! I use it twice a day, and when I wake up in the morning, I&#x27;m still so fresh, I feel like I don&#x27;t need to brush. (Even though I do).</li>
    <li> Very refreshing. Excellent toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great product with nice packaging..a little pricey being the only downside.</li>
    <li> i really tried. I was suckered by the packaging. but I would rather brush my teeth with cigarette ashes than to taste this again... bad mediciney after-taste. I tried another flavor, and it had the same weird after taste. it looks posh tho.</li>
