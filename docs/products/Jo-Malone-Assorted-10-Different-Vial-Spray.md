      <li>Great variety pack, the fragrances are awesome.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I decided to purchase.</li>
      <li>All are  great, however, I have two favorites already.  </li>
      <li>and I also wish I got it in a box because I was thinking of giving it out as a gift and the packaging came in a ziplock bag which wasn&#x27;t attractive.</li>
      <li>Great fragrance samples</li>
      <li>Great perfume set</li>
      <li>Jo Malone is really great perfume.</li>
      <li>Really nice perfume set!</li>
      <li>I loved the elegant box with the vials wrapped in purple tissue.  </li>
      <li>lovely perfumes and great for helping me choose which was a favorite.</li>
      <li>but I love the chance to try out these beautiful scents before spending $90 on a full size bottle.</li>
      <li>Neither of the testers that were just mailed to me come anything close to the two genuine bottles I own.</li>
      <li>9 diff smells (2 cucumber ones which is ok for me).</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>Most of the perfumes smelled like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
      <li>I love all the fragrances...</li>
      <li>Love it.....</li>
      <li>I love the Jo Malone sampler pack.</li>
      <li>It was a great Jo Malone introduction for a new friend</li>
      <li>Received my sampler and am excited to try these to determine which one I want to buy more of.</li>
      <li>and then they give you two free samples to try.  </li>
      <li>The tiny spray vials are a great way to do this set, but two of them don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>but they are basically the size of free samples.  </li>
      <li>the higher my body temp went up while I was working the more the aroma blossomed around me.</li>
      <li>The service was excellent and there was the right amount of packaging to assure no damage without creating waste.</li>
      <li>Love Jo Malone for their creative scents that you can wear individually or mix for variety.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Worth trying.</li>
      <li>I wish they would have been more clear about this on the description.</li>
      <li>I love all ten fragrances!</li>
      <li>Love the variety and different scents.</li>
      <li>My first pick to test was nectarine and honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>carefully washed my wrist to be sure to get the true scent and so far I am testing #6.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice little selection.</li>
      <li>None of the fragrances are really ones I would buy</li>
      <li>Can get the same items from the counter for free.</li>
      <li>The package came fast and in tact.</li>
      <li>I thought they might be a bit larger than the ones that are free from the Jo Malone counter, but</li>
      <li>I smell divine and will purchase more for gifts in the near future.</li>
      <li>The small multi set is nice</li>
      <li>First of all, I didn&#x27;t get but 7 vials and three were the same!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money because the samples are high quality and enough product comes inside the vials to try on for several days.</li>
      <li>Several of the vials are all the exact same scents so there is only really 5 different fragrances!  </li>
      <li>True Pomegranate Noir will usually stick through two washings with just a tiny spritz.</li>
      <li>so this was pretty much a waste for me.  </li>

<li> All scents came separately wrapped instead of in a nice box :(  </li>

<li> This is NOT genuine product.</li>
<li> Instead go on the Jo Malone site and order a small bottle of the perfume you like</li>
<li> The Pomegranate Noir also smells heavily of rubbing alcohol, and the little bit of scent it does impart smells like a really bad attempt at a knock-off (or maybe contaminated with another scent?)</li>
<li> Disappointed I could actually give this gift.</li>
<li> Took over 2 weeks to get the set and then vials were broken.</li>
<li> For $28 after shipping I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
<li> 2 of the vials didn&#x27;t work.  :(</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> This is NOT genuine product. The little bottles are the sample sized pre-printed bottles they hand out at the Jo Malone counter, but the scents are completely off. I already owned two of the scents that came in the scent, a full-size Nectarine Blossom &amp; Honey and a sample of the Pomegranate Noir, which were purchased in person at a Jo Malone counter. Neither of the testers that were just mailed to me come anything close to the two genuine bottles I own. The Nectarine Blossom &amp; Honey smells like pure rubbing alcohol and leaves no scent behind on my skin at all. The Pomegranate Noir also smells heavily of rubbing alcohol, and the little bit of scent it does impart smells like a really bad attempt at a knock-off (or maybe contaminated with another scent?) and completely dissapates in less than five minutes. True Pomegranate Noir will usually stick through two washings with just a tiny spritz. Save your money, don&#x27;t buy these!</li>
    <li> I love the Jo Malone sampler pack. My only surprise was that one of the reviewers said they came boxed. They did not, so just a set of them did not feels like a Xmas gift. Perhaps they no longer offer the box and bow?</li>
    <li> It arrived even before the date it was due. The service was excellent and there was the right amount of packaging to assure no damage without creating waste. I smell divine and will purchase more for gifts in the near future. I love this perfume. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Is there a way to give this zero stars?  These are the freebies that you get when you order an actual Jo Malone fragrance.  We&#x27;re being charged for the mini samples!  Do not buy these.  Don&#x27;t be duped!  Instead go on the Jo Malone site and order a small bottle of the perfume you like and then they give you two free samples to try.  This is such a scam!</li>
    <li> Love it.....the higher my body temp went up while I was working the more the aroma blossomed around me. Everyone was saying &amp;#34;girl you smellin good&amp;#34;....lol...made my day</li>
    <li> 2 of the vials didn&#x27;t work.  :(</li>
    <li> Received my sampler and am excited to try these to determine which one I want to buy more of.</li>
    <li> Really nice perfume set!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance samples</li>
    <li> I thought they might be a bit larger than the ones that are free from the Jo Malone counter, but oh well, great smells !!!</li>
    <li> Love the variety and different scents. These are perfect for traveling.</li>
    <li> Love Jo Malone for their creative scents that you can wear individually or mix for variety. Worth trying. The small multi set is nice so you can figure out what you life me before investing in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent Price for the number of assorted Jo Malone vials... Very satisfied with the variety, the quantity and the price !!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to test and smell the fragrances without a pushy saleslady staring at me. I received 10 different fragrances to sample. The package came fast and in tact. It&#x27;s worth the money because the samples are high quality and enough product comes inside the vials to try on for several days.</li>
    <li> Great perfume set but I wish I got a list of the different kinds I would be receiving and I also wish I got it in a box because I was thinking of giving it out as a gift and the packaging came in a ziplock bag which wasn&#x27;t attractive. Otherwise I love the set!!!</li>
    <li> although I wrote a review two days after my order came, I will repeat it.  I loved the elegant box with the vials wrapped in purple tissue.  My first pick to test was nectarine and honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carefully washed my wrist to be sure to get the true scent and so far I am testing #6.  All are  great, however, I have two favorites already.  I probably purchase a larger bottle once I am finished testing all..</li>
    <li> Took over 2 weeks to get the set and then vials were broken. Not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Can get the same items from the counter for free.</li>
    <li> Jo Malone is really great perfume. This is a nice little selection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I decided to purchase. I have used each vial twice already on all pulse points and still have some left over for a third use. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> Most of the perfumes smelled like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> I was sad this was missing Red Roses, the one I most wanted to be included in the set (this was a gift).</li>
    <li> Great variety pack, the fragrances are awesome. Just what I needed to decide on cologne for me; several uses per vial while deciding!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little concerned that these are manufacturer samples and not meant for resale... but I love the chance to try out these beautiful scents before spending $90 on a full size bottle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;Wood Sage and Sea Salt&amp;#34; which was the one I was actually considering buying! Instead, they enclosed &amp;#34;Grapefruit&amp;#34;. The tiny spray vials are a great way to do this set, but two of them don&#x27;t work. I really like a few of the scents I rec&#x27;d, but would not purchase any of them because they last only about 3-4 hours on me. Everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different, but they aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I order this \\&quot;assorted\\&quot; set so I could sample 10 different fragrances.  Several of the vials are all the exact same scents so there is only really 5 different fragrances!  For $28 after shipping I&#x27;m disappointed.  None of the fragrances are really ones I would buy so this was pretty much a waste for me.  I wish they would have been more clear about this on the description.</li>
    <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t get but 7 vials and three were the same! I thought it was an assorted order. I got sewed on both ends!</li>
    <li> A wonderful assortment of fragrances!</li>
    <li> lovely perfumes and great for helping me choose which was a favorite.</li>
    <li> I love all the fragrances... It was a great Jo Malone introduction for a new friend</li>
    <li> This is my best shopping experience on Amazon! I love all ten fragrances!</li>
    <li> Perfect pack. Quick shipping. 9 diff smells (2 cucumber ones which is ok for me). Now i can choose perfect Jo Malone for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered to try a specific scent which was in the description but it did not come with order. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> All scents came separately wrapped instead of in a nice box :(  I didn&#x27;t check the size of the bottles but they are basically the size of free samples.  Disappointed I could actually give this gift.</li>
