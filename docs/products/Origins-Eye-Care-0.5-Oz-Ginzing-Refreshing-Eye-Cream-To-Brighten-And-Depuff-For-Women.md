      <li>NICE BRIGHTENING EYE CREAM.</li>
      <li>I have really enjoyed my eye cream, I use it every morning and sometimes before I go out at night to make sure my eyes are always looking bright.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars because it is nice and does make my eyes look more awake.</li>
      <li>I have used everything from Hylexin to Bliss products and this is the best by far.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s good to use around my eyes, which are easily irritated by strong scents.</li>
      <li>We are hooked and we plan to purchase more of their products.</li>
      <li>Love the Origins line though.</li>
      <li>I found nothing refreshing about this eye cream.  </li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t  going to make the circles and puffiness magically disappear.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love how it illuminates.  </li>
      <li>I am going to buy more.  </li>
      <li>(like a tingling sensation) it does have nice light reflectors that make my skin look brighter.</li>
      <li>find that while it doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;refreshing</li>
      <li>exaggerating my eye wrinkles more than</li>
      <li>I love this eye cream.  </li>
      <li>However, I prefer eye creams that are a bit more refreshing and do a better job of depuffing.</li>
      <li>but what I ordered was someone&#x27;s free sample!</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>The eye cream itself has a nice light whipped texture.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and will buy more.</li>
      <li>The most Refreshing Eye Cream, I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I order a 0.5 ounce origins GinZing Refreshing eye cream, but I received 3 sample.</li>
      <li>and we already see better results than all the others.</li>
      <li>Love the feel and texture.</li>
      <li>Perks up skin and feels nice and cool and refreshing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In summary, GinZing is a good eye cream and certainly made my eye area look better.</li>
      <li>it is a great product though, makes my puffiness and circles completely disappear with a bit of concealer afterwards!</li>
      <li>Goes on easily under makeup</li>
      <li>Also reduces puffiness and fine lines.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this just 5 days ago.  </li>
      <li>; causing me to think this was originally a free sample.</li>
      <li>It also reflects the light a bit too.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a moisturizing eye cream that would be good for my sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great that this product is instantly gratifying and also doing great things for my skin in the long run!</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>GREAT stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Light and refreshing and it has a slight shimmer when you apply it to your eye area.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually able to notice a positive difference.</li>
      <li>Very nice product and makes my skin look alive and young.</li>
      <li>I got this eye cream expecting great things as it does claim to reduce dark circles, unsightly bags and puffiness.</li>
      <li>Not bad - maybe it has to do with the way it had been stored, but something is not quite right.</li>
      <li>There is a subtle shimmer that really reflects the light from my circles and goes great under make up!</li>
      <li>Same sort of thing here with GinZing - it will give a nice glow to the skin around the eyes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or overwhelming</li>
      <li>and she was right.</li>
      <li>just the right texture.  </li>
      <li>I would not say this rids one of bags and black circles, but it sure does help me look Perrier and more alert.</li>
      <li>I usually wake up with puffy eyes and this is a great product when I don&#x27;t have time to use my cooling mask that I keep in the fridge.</li>
      <li>I am curious to see how I feel once my sample runs out, probably in another week, but I just ordered some more!</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve tried many eye creams to help with puffiness, dark circles and fine lines.</li>
      <li>I love using this stuff, especially nights where I don&#x27;t sleep well!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a complete cover-up or miracle cure by any means, but it is leaps and bounds better than any product before it.  </li>
      <li>The name of the product certainly earns it&#x27;s explanation.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I did really like was that it seems to be very hydrating and leaves a light pearly appearance under your eyes which is pretty under your make up.</li>
      <li>Works really well on bags.  </li>
      <li>I was really hoping for something to help with the baggage I carry under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Have used it for over a year, really wakes the eyes up.  </li>
      <li>this eye cream works very well to help with these issues.  </li>
      <li>This really brightens your eyes and makes you look awake in the morning.</li>
      <li>I have also tried the cleansing gel and that one works very well to.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It brightens the under eye area and reduces redness, making you look like you had a great night&#x27;s sleep and get you through the day without a tired appearance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will say though that GinZing&#x27;s light reflectors do help camouflage them, but it isn&#x27;t a total miracle cream.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Origins eye cream didn&#x27;t do much to depuff by baggy eyes and made my concealer \\&quot;cakey\\&quot;....</li>
      <li>However, I AM finally comfortable being around family and my boyfriend with only the eye cream on and no makeup.  </li>
      <li>I have been an avid Origins lover for their natural approach to cosmetics but never tried an undereye therapy.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend it highly to anyone I know.</li>
      <li>/&gt;GinZing has a light peachy color and a slight fruity scent.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but it may be helping a little.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin around my eyes and</li>
      <li>if I just used the concealer directly under my eyes.</li>
      <li>Also, it looks old and the cap is worn.</li>
      <li>I also love the subtle shimmer of the cream.</li>
      <li>Why I paid such a high price for it?</li>
      <li>I am only 28 but having a baby, I missed out on vital beauty sleep and the price has been paid.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m dissapointed at how much money i spent on this eye cream</li>
      <li>Nice eye cream, but not life changing if you have serious dark circles.</li>
      <li>But the tiny jar that I received was marked &amp;#34;not for individual sale,&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll spend the extra couple bucks from now on and buy it from a major retailer.</li>
      <li>It really reduces puffiness and lightens the dark circles under the eyes.  </li>
      <li>Super moisturizing and just a slight tint of color to camouflage dark circles.</li>

    <li> Favorite eye cream ever! I swear by it daily. Perks up skin and feels nice and cool and refreshing. Never makes my eyes water!</li>
    <li> Not really worth the price. I was looking for a moisturizing eye cream that would be good for my sensitive eyes. This eye cream made my eyes feel dried out and it also made them feel crusty in the morning. It also did not really doing for the tiredness of my eyes. I&#x27;m dissapointed at how much money i spent on this eye cream</li>
    <li> great product. i&#x27;ve tried many eye creams to help with puffiness, dark circles and fine lines. this eye cream works very well to help with these issues.  My make up looks amazing every morning. and i&#x27;ve only used it one week.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in product. Has not reduced bags under my eyes</li>
    <li> I got this cream for my fiance. She wanted to try something new after purchasing very expensive eye creams that helped very little. Shes been using it for a couple weeks and we already see better results than all the others. We are hooked and we plan to purchase more of their products. I cant wait to try their makeup!&lt;br /&gt;:D</li>
    <li> I had spent years and used various eye cream products but none worked for me until one day I read an article on Yahoo recommended Origin GinZing Eye Cream for eyes. I decided to give it a try. After using the product for only 10 days (2 times a day, morning and night), I could see that my eye puffiness visibly reduced. I am so happy with the product. I am going to buy more.  I have also tried the cleansing gel and that one works very well to. It makes my skin feel tight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in the mornings for about 6 months! I love it! I have really, really dark under eye circles and this is the only thing that works for me. There is a subtle shimmer that really reflects the light from my circles and goes great under make up! It&#x27;s great that this product is instantly gratifying and also doing great things for my skin in the long run! The only downside I have is that I can only use it once a day because my eyes get red and irritated if I over use it! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has trouble with under eye circles!</li>
    <li> Love the feel and texture. Also reduces puffiness and fine lines.</li>
    <li> seriously, the same product in the same size containing is only $30.00 on sephora, just a head&#x27;s up. it is a great product though, makes my puffiness and circles completely disappear with a bit of concealer afterwards! also a half ounce jar lasts like half a year, so the price isn&#x27;t all that scary, either.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping for something to help with the baggage I carry under my eyes.  It does soften the circles and is a very nice mosturizer...just didn&#x27;t depuff as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> This little jar of cream arrived as promised. It looks like the cream I&#x27;ve used before. The luminance factor is perhaps even stronger than the cream I&#x27;ve used before - and that, ironically, is the problem. I&#x27;m not sure it IS the cream I&#x27;ve been using now for a couple of years. The texture seems subtly different, the way it spreads and absorbs into my skin. Weird. Not bad - maybe it has to do with the way it had been stored, but something is not quite right. I&#x27;ll spend the extra couple bucks from now on and buy it from a major retailer.</li>
    <li> It really reduces puffiness and lightens the dark circles under the eyes.  I also love the subtle shimmer of the cream.</li>
    <li> A daily must to brighten and refresh my tired and stressed eyes. I would not say this rids one of bags and black circles, but it sure does help me look Perrier and more alert.</li>
    <li> Good but if u wear contact keep away from inside corner of your eyes somewhat irritating</li>
    <li> I use it every day.It also reflects the light a bit too. I have sensitive skin around my eyes and this cream did not bother me.</li>
    <li> A good friend said is was amazing so I decided to try it and she was right. GREAT stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Light and refreshing and it has a slight shimmer when you apply it to your eye area. NOT sparkly but kinda of a glow.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy this again and again</li>
    <li> I have had this cream for about 3 weeks now and I must say I am impressed with its power to &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;de-puff&amp;#34; around my eyes.  I have been an avid Origins lover for their natural approach to cosmetics but never tried an undereye therapy.  I love this stuff and will buy more.</li>
    <li> But the tiny jar that I received was marked &amp;#34;not for individual sale,&amp;#34; causing me to think this was originally a free sample. Why I paid such a high price for it? Hmmmm.....</li>
    <li> I like the product but what I ordered was someone&#x27;s free sample! At least that&#x27;s what it looks like. Also, it looks old and the cap is worn.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.  Its not too thick.  just the right texture.  I love how it illuminates.  Must purchase!</li>
    <li> This really brightens your eyes and makes you look awake in the morning. I love using this stuff, especially nights where I don&#x27;t sleep well!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this just 5 days ago.  I have been using it in the morning, before bed, and after my workouts.  I have seen a big difference in 5 days.  I have never used an eye cream, and was apparently in desperate need.  I am curious to see how I feel once my sample runs out, probably in another week, but I just ordered some more!</li>
    <li> After using this cream for over a month, there seems to be NO change in my under eye circles.  The only thing I did really like was that it seems to be very hydrating and leaves a light pearly appearance under your eyes which is pretty under your make up.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results from the product yet wasted my money buying this product.I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product but it might work for someone else.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but it may be helping a little. Nothing is a miracle.</li>
    <li> best eye cream I have used</li>
    <li> The best as are all their products.</li>
    <li> I got this eye cream expecting great things as it does claim to reduce dark circles, unsightly bags and puffiness. But it didn&#x27;t turn out to be the miracle worker that I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GinZing has a light peachy color and a slight fruity scent. It&#x27;s not heavy or overwhelming so it&#x27;s good to use around my eyes, which are easily irritated by strong scents. The eye cream itself has a nice light whipped texture. I found it to be very concentrated and a little bit tapped around the eyes goes a long way. It absorbs quickly and easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that while it doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;refreshing feel\\&quot; (like a tingling sensation) it does have nice light reflectors that make my skin look brighter. My skin also feels smoother and tighter, and wrinkles less obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the dark circles are still there, as is the puffiness when I have it. I will say though that GinZing&#x27;s light reflectors do help camouflage them, but it isn&#x27;t a total miracle cream. It reminds me a lot of what Benefit EyeCon, which they call a eye brightening cream. Same sort of thing here with GinZing - it will give a nice glow to the skin around the eyes but it isn&#x27;t  going to make the circles and puffiness magically disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is that when I apply my foundation over it, the eye brightening qualities of the cream are somewhat covered up. So I will sometimes mix in a bit to my foundation, and then apply. That way the benefits of this cream aren&#x27;t totally lost when I put my makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, GinZing is a good eye cream and certainly made my eye area look better. However, I prefer eye creams that are a bit more refreshing and do a better job of depuffing. I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars because it is nice and does make my eyes look more awake.</li>
    <li> I found nothing refreshing about this eye cream.  It provides some moisture, but the price is extortionate for such a small container of cream, offering nothing different than a lesser priced drug store moisturizer.</li>
    <li> NICE BRIGHTENING EYE CREAM. ONLY COMPLAINT IS IT IS PRICEY FOR SIZE.</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful.  Have used it for over a year, really wakes the eyes up.  Goes on easily under makeup</li>
    <li> The natural ingredients in this eye cream will instantly disguise a late night or \\&quot;hung-over\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It brightens the under eye area and reduces redness, making you look like you had a great night&#x27;s sleep and get you through the day without a tired appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smooths onto skin slick, no pulling or tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this is a wonderful product and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate for a moment to recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have used Origins products for years.  Can&#x27;t recall one I haven&#x27;t liked.  Am using this alternately with PW Eye whatever.</li>
    <li> Super moisturizing and just a slight tint of color to camouflage dark circles.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and makes my skin look alive and young. I would recommend it highly to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> I did not use it, but I received an different item. I order a 0.5 ounce origins GinZing Refreshing eye cream, but I received 3 sample.</li>
    <li> On a 1-10 scale, my dark circles are an 8.  I have used everything from Hylexin to Bliss products and this is the best by far.  It is a little grainy/mineraly so I don&#x27;t wear it under foundation.  However, I AM finally comfortable being around family and my boyfriend with only the eye cream on and no makeup.  it&#x27;s not a complete cover-up or miracle cure by any means, but it is leaps and bounds better than any product before it.  The jar is small but it lasts a very long time since you only need a tiny bit for each application.</li>
    <li> Sephora told me to use this under my eyes and then use my concealer and foundation as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Origins eye cream didn&#x27;t do much to depuff by baggy eyes and made my concealer \\&quot;cakey\\&quot;....exaggerating my eye wrinkles more than if I just used the concealer directly under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed my eye cream, I use it every morning and sometimes before I go out at night to make sure my eyes are always looking bright.  Smells great &amp; is nice &amp; light &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for both the bags under my eyes and and black rings for over 30 days for 2 to 3 times a day. No results at all except I&#x27;m out $30 .</li>
    <li> Was expecting great things .. But used jar with no results as hoped for. Did not depuff or get rid of dark circles.. It did not even lighten it a bit.. Very disappointed.. Love the Origins line though.</li>
    <li> Works really well on bags.  Makes your skin feel a tiny bit tight but, bags be gone! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it works amazingly especially after nights of little sleep.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the best! It not only reduces puffiness, but the brightner makes me look wide awake even when fatigued. Great product!</li>
    <li> Feels good but didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Will continue to buy it.  The name of the product certainly earns it&#x27;s explanation.  The most Refreshing Eye Cream, I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream, but not life changing if you have serious dark circles.</li>
    <li> I usually wake up with puffy eyes and this is a great product when I don&#x27;t have time to use my cooling mask that I keep in the fridge. I&#x27;m usually able to notice a positive difference.</li>
    <li> I WAS OVERCHARGED MY $17,98.  GINZING IS 30.00 a jar in Macy&#x27;s and Sephora.  I want a refund on my two overchared jars.</li>
    <li> I bought this at sephora a few months ago and applied daily as instructed. Never saw a change. I am only 28 but having a baby, I missed out on vital beauty sleep and the price has been paid. I can not get rid of these darks circles for anything. I believe this is a overpriced product and doesn&#x27;t deliver the promise of diminishing bags and dark circles. Maybe I am the exception to the rule though. I see lots of 5 star ratings</li>
