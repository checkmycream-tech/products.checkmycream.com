      <li>Redken is a good product</li>

      <li>They changed the formula and it is not so good anymore...</li>
      <li>I tried the 11 but its not as good as the 15  </li>
      <li>I have had good results with it.</li>

      <li>(I wish there was a fragrance free option!)</li>
      <li>Need to find another better product for my hair.</li>
      <li>I love this thermal protectant spray.</li>
      <li>so it would not feel like I was getting more steam from the heat of the flatiron</li>
      <li>It just felt to have more water in the product.  </li>
      <li>I love the Redken Iron Shape Thermal Spray.</li>
      <li>This was an okay product.  </li>
      <li>It was okay</li>
      <li>Love this product and would buy it again.  </li>
      <li>Love it, and also love Redken&#x27;s heat glide.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product as my hair has been keeping shiny and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>I love redken products and would recommend this to anyone I know.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this products.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite hair products.</li>
      <li>, I have another that I like more.</li>
      <li>So my hair smells awesome all day long while being protected.</li>
      <li>The seller got it to me very quickly and the price I paid was fantastic compared to a salon!</li>
      <li>I recently just bought a new straightener for my hair and decided that it was probably best to invest in a good heat protectant for my hair.</li>
      <li>Just spray it on your hair brush and comb through hair all over before you start, and it should work fine.</li>
      <li>Very protective and adds nice shine.</li>
      <li>Spray not half as good as the product it replaced #15.  </li>
      <li>I recommend getting this product, it is worth every cent!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
      <li>Another benefit is the fresh and fruity smell.</li>
      <li>my old redken starch- love it.</li>
      <li>It does hold the hair in place as you blow dry and smoothes the frizzies kind of like a mild hair spray.</li>
      <li>Curls stay tight and bouncy all day and it smells amazing too!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a hot product without the crunchy buildup.</li>
      <li>organix flat iron spray is not flammable and is more moisterizing</li>
      <li>Totally makes a huge difference to apply this spray before using a flatiron.  </li>
      <li>but it really does work.  </li>
      <li>Much smoother, shinier hair.</li>
      <li>I straighten my hair daily, and iron shape helps protect it, keeps it smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>I even use it to boosts curls after a few days after washing, when I have frizz and not so spectacular curls.</li>
      <li>I am not sure if this product is effective or not as I have only used it a couple of times.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft.</li>
      <li>I use this before I straighten or blow dry my hair, and I think it protects it pretty well.</li>
      <li>Product arrived very fast and works just as expected.</li>
      <li>The only time I have had an issue when using this is when the humidity is really high.  </li>
      <li>If you need a solid hold on a style such as a curl, then this will do it.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t create touchable soft hair as much as this creates hair that won&#x27;t budge and it stays where you need</li>
      <li>It really helps keep my frizz at bay prior to flat ironing.</li>
      <li>My hair is thin and baby fine.</li>

<li> I have dry curly hair that I like to use heat on from time to time (flat iron, ghd curler).</li>
<li> I do not like the bottle that it comes in because it sprays such a wide distance that I end up getting spray all over my face.  </li>

<li> I tried various other sprays to get my curls to stay put</li>
<li> I will finish off this spray and then go back to my other product.</li>
<li> Although this is intended for use with thermal stylers, I also find it works extremely well when hair is damp after a shower, before blow drying with a regular hair dryer.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s very long hair.</li>
<li> It definitely helps my hair hold a style without weighing it down.</li>
<li> It will help you have less frizz and help the curl/volumn last longer</li>
<li> Really no different from a product I could have purchased at Walmart for less.</li>
<li> which is to be expected.  </li>
<li> I was skeptical at first</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> not too much can go wrong w/</li>
<li> It weighs your hair down, so use sparingly.</li>
<li> My previous styling product was discontinued a few years ago</li>
<li> Spray a few times through your hair.  </li>
<li> and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff or sticky.</li>
<li> It also calms the hair, so that helps tame it while straightening.</li>
<li> Finally I&#x27;ve found a product that doesn&#x27;t smell too bad</li>
<li> I was very very disappointed in this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought the thermal spray because my hair stylist recommended it. Great product and really fast shipment!</li>
    <li> This has a definite perfumey smell.  I&#x27;d prefer if it didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell but I&#x27;m allergic to perfume.  It does hold the hair in place as you blow dry and smoothes the frizzies kind of like a mild hair spray.</li>
    <li> Not the standard of Spray Starch #15 but close and does the job.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Best spray I&#x27;ve used to straighten my hair yet! The seller got it to me very quickly and the price I paid was fantastic compared to a salon!</li>
    <li> ...and smells so good!</li>
    <li> I recently just bought a new straightener for my hair and decided that it was probably best to invest in a good heat protectant for my hair. I absolutely love this product as my hair has been keeping shiny and healthy looking. I recommend getting this product, it is worth every cent!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this. Use spray on you hair after drying before styling.  Spray a few times through your hair.  It will help you have less frizz and help the curl/volumn last longer</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this product is effective or not as I have only used it a couple of times.  I do not like the bottle that it comes in because it sprays such a wide distance that I end up getting spray all over my face.  If they could just improve the container, then I would be happy to try it again.,</li>
    <li> A SPRITZ ON HAIR BEFORE YOU USE YOUR CURLING IRON.. GIVES A GREAT SET WITHOUT FEELING STICKY.  THE BOTTLE LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> I use this before I straighten or blow dry my hair, and I think it protects it pretty well. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this product and would buy it again.  Great protection for your hair</li>
    <li> It weighs your hair down, so use sparingly. And don&#x27;t use it between layers either. Just spray it on your hair brush and comb through hair all over before you start, and it should work fine.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that protects hair and helps it hold a set. My hair is thin and baby fine. Using this spray before I using a curling iron gives me long lasting results!</li>

    <li> This was an okay product.  Really no different from a product I could have purchased at Walmart for less.</li>
    <li> Smells &amp;#34;dusty&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything but Redken! I have recommended this to many of my friends for great protectant! Great price too!</li>
    <li> Very nice as any product from Redken.</li>
    <li> I tried the 11 but its not as good as the 15  Could you tell me where I can find the 15 (heat styling shaper?)</li>
    <li> not too much can go wrong w/ this if you know you want it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hair products. I straighten my hair daily, and iron shape helps protect it, keeps it smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is not as advertised. I was very very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> This spray works great.  I tried various other sprays to get my curls to stay put and they fell out every time.  Until I came across this.  I was skeptical at first but it really does work.  The only time I have had an issue when using this is when the humidity is really high.  My hair did fall then which is to be expected.  Other than that I have had good results with it.</li>
    <li> I have Redken shampoo and thought I would try this thermal spray.  It was okay, I have another that I like more. It just felt to have more water in the product.  I tried using the spray different ways so it would not feel like I was getting more steam from the heat of the flatiron but nothing seem to work.  I will finish off this spray and then go back to my other product.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula and it is not so good anymore...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like my old redken starch- love it.</li>
    <li> Although this is intended for use with thermal stylers, I also find it works extremely well when hair is damp after a shower, before blow drying with a regular hair dryer.  Gives nice lift and volume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years and love it! It&#x27;s a hot product without the crunchy buildup.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any hair.</li>
    <li> I have my hair bleached and couldn&#x27;t iron my hair because it would burn every time, but with this product and in the lowest temperature in the iron is the perfect product for my hair.</li>
    <li> Redken is a good product but I find this to be drying to the hair but it adds a lot of shine!  it concerns me for the bottle says FLAMMABLE but we use it to flat iron? organix flat iron spray is not flammable and is more moisterizing</li>
    <li> I love the Redken Iron Shape Thermal Spray. I iron my hair a lot and it&#x27;s very long hair. This helps protect my hair from heat damage. Very pleasant smell. Leaves my hair soft. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works well with my frizzy hair which resists styling and it helps get it straightened out.  My hair dresser turned me onto this product.</li>
    <li> Definitely cheaper to buy this here instead of locally.  Works as advertised.  Totally makes a huge difference to apply this spray before using a flatiron.  Much smoother, shinier hair.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says, holds a curl.  I use every time I&#x27;m curling my hair.</li>
    <li> My previous styling product was discontinued a few years ago so I&#x27;ve tried several different products in the interim. Finally I&#x27;ve found a product that doesn&#x27;t smell too bad (I wish there was a fragrance free option!) and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff or sticky. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up a residue like some others do. It definitely helps my hair hold a style without weighing it down. My hair is layered with a fair amount of curl.</li>
    <li> The smell!!!!!!!  Gives my hair great shine and eliminates the frizzies as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I have dry curly hair that I like to use heat on from time to time (flat iron, ghd curler). I stay this product all over every inch of my hair and do my hair when it dries. Very protective and adds nice shine. I even use it to boosts curls after a few days after washing, when I have frizz and not so spectacular curls. It gives my hair life and a second go at things before I wash again! Love it, and also love Redken&#x27;s heat glide. Have been using that for ten years or so!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me, but I haven&#x27;t found that it does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t fool around. If you need a solid hold on a style such as a curl, then this will do it.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t create touchable soft hair as much as this creates hair that won&#x27;t budge and it stays where you need it.&lt;br /&gt;I could see using this if I were creating vintage curls that I neededto last all day or all night.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived very fast and works just as expected. I love redken products and would recommend this to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this products. Curls stay tight and bouncy all day and it smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> Besides the fact that this stuff works so well, it smells amazing! So my hair smells awesome all day long while being protected.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I spray it in to my hands and rub it it in.  Also softens my hand</li>
