### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but I am very happy I bought this.  </li>
      <li>Bought this for a bedroom vanity and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>Perfect height to put makeup and contacts on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Mirrors were very good.</li>
      <li>Perfect for my wife to replace the one she had, and at a great price.</li>
      <li>It is just beautiful and versitile.  </li>
      <li>Great mirror.</li>
      <li>great service.  </li>
      <li>Attractive satin nickle finish&lt;br</li>
      <li>Esthetically, the product is very nice.  </li>
      <li>However, I ordered it in satin nickel finish &amp; it even said so on the box, but inside it was a brightly polished chrome mirror..  </li>
      <li>The light is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Good value.</li>
      <li>Good height if you are seated at a vanity table.</li>
      <li>Good magnification at 8X&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>8x magnification is good.</li>
      <li>The lighting is good too.</li>
      <li>but the lighting is not that great, the magnification could be better if it was maybe a 6 or 7</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>the light is great and bright.  </li>
      <li>I returned that one and bought this one which is much better!</li>
      <li>Really nice 8x magnification.</li>
      <li>The height is good on top of the vanity</li>
      <li>Nice look.</li>
      <li>(those seem to be popular, but they are both pains-the batteries die and the cord switch is not convenient).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but my girlfriend liked it.</li>
      <li>The 8X magnification is perfect for seeing REALLY close up.</li>
      <li>It lights both sides of the mirror, which is nice.</li>
      <li>This mirror is so nice.</li>
      <li>The light is nice a bright and the magnification doesn&#x27;t distort.  </li>
      <li>Plus if the lighting was better the adjusted lighting knob would actually be a nice function.</li>
      <li>Light isn&#x27;t as bright as I thought it would be</li>
      <li>Looks good works as described with the exception of the light off on dimmer switch.</li>
      <li>Love this mirror.</li>
      <li>I think my vain descendants will be plenty pleased too.  </li>
      <li>It appears to be really well made and works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>Product was returned and will look for a better alternative.</li>
      <li>Zadro mirrors are a bit pricier than Conair, but by comparison, seem to be better quality.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more brightness.</li>
      <li>The magnification is so good that the first time I looked in it</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re using it, you should have another light source and it should be a pretty good one.</li>
      <li>I really like this lighted mirror, quite weighty which is good because it won&#x27;t knock over easily.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s weight is perfect so you can change from one side to the other without it tipping over.</li>
      <li>The switch turns easily and is conveniently located on the front of the stand.</li>
      <li>The mirror swivels easily, but stays put when positioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is may not be the brightest, but does the job well.</li>
      <li>If a lamp light or the mirror lights are on, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>so my granddaughter uses it as a night light, as well as for makeup.</li>
      <li>Mirror comes with a replacement bulb and these bulbs appear to be readily available</li>
      <li>and I like the varying light intensity.  </li>
      <li>The light is on a dimmer</li>
      <li>I thought the mirror was great until I noticed that only one of the bulbs was working.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this for anyone that likes to be able to get a good look at all those pores and wants to get their brows really well tweezed.</li>
      <li>8x is perfect- just enough for my mom, as 10x was too much for her.</li>
      <li>The brushed nickel looks very nice</li>
      <li>I returned it as it wasn&#x27;t very useful with these two issues.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t have a bright enough light.  </li>
      <li>I like everything about this mirror except that it isn&#x27;t bright enough.  </li>
      <li>Excellent, bright, adjustable lighting (much better than Conair&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;- Electrical outlet in the base (very handy)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>And the light is too dim even at it&#x27;s highest light setting.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the right height for use with a vanity.  </li>
      <li>Only wish the lighting could be a tad brighter, but it is bright enough to make a HUGE difference in my makeup application.  </li>
      <li>I had to quickly get out my tweezers and really work on my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>The mirror part is fine, but what is with all these lighted makeup mirrors and their dim lights???</li>
      <li>Sometimes it is better to not be able to see every little imperfection!</li>
      <li>The first shipment came with the mirror cracked.</li>
      <li>The light in this mirror is DIM.</li>
      <li>Any higher magnification</li>
      <li>The first time the unit was plugged in and turned on the ballast blew and the lights did not work.  </li>
      <li>The double-sided make-up mirror arrived on time and was exactly the item ordered.  </li>
      <li>Also love it that it has an outlet so I can plug my flat iron into it.</li>
      <li>Those who complained it was too bright must spend their days lying in a coffin waiting for night.</li>
      <li>i really like the mirror.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have another mirror to compare it to.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to lean over so much.</li>
      <li>This is a very well made unit.  </li>
      <li>That being said, I had a mirror with stronger lights and if it was the sole light source, my eyes saw spots afterwards.  </li>
      <li>Because I did like the item, I figured it was too much of a hassle to return it, so I kept it.  </li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to be right up on it to get a clear view yet still get a close up.</li>
      <li>So maybe too bright is not good for the eyes.  </li>
      <li>Hope the company will be very helpful getting the new product to us.</li>
      <li>, it came with 1 extra bulb (the lamp takes 2), it was reasonably priced and it looks pretty on my vanity.</li>
      <li>the face of this mirror is so small I could barely see my own whole face in it.  </li>
      <li>The new bulbs arrived at our house and were replaced.  </li>
      <li>This mirror gets quite hot when left on the brightest setting.</li>
      <li>The light on this mirror may illuminate your face if you&#x27;re in a totally dark room.</li>
      <li>mirror is heavy, so it shouldn&#x27;t get knocked over easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s the only light in the room either, so it works well to put the light in front of your face instead of behind your head (in the bedroom) or beside you (lamp).</li>
      <li>Money was not wasted.</li>
      <li>They credited my account within 2 days and I ordered another directly from Amazon.</li>
      <li>had an earlier version that was much brighter, They have changed the bulb to a lessor quality, non halogen</li>
      <li>Yes, I know it is dimmable, but on full-blown it gives off very little light.</li>
      <li>Plus I realized that I could just buy bulb replacements for my current mirror instead of spending a fortune on a new one.</li>
      <li>Initial contact with company was cordial and they said they would send out two new bulbs, although it would be unusual for both bulbs to burn out at the same time, instead of instructing and facilitating sending the product back for an exchange.  </li>
      <li>I bought this mirror to replace my old one that died recently.  </li>
      <li>Gave it only for stars because the light is not very bright.</li>
      <li>Only complaint would be that the light could be brighter and that is why I rated it a 4 of 5.  </li>
      <li>While I like the durability of this mirror if I could change the dull yellow light it gives off this would definitely be a 5 star rating.</li>

    <li> This mirror is so nice. It&#x27;s weight is perfect so you can change from one side to the other without it tipping over. The light is perfect for me. The magnification is so good that the first time I looked in it I was shocked at how much detail I can see. I had to quickly get out my tweezers and really work on my eyebrows. I couldn&#x27;t see before how bad they were.</li>
    <li> Looks good works as described with the exception of the light off on dimmer switch. it is very difficult to turn.  With that in mine I would look for a different product if I was going to purchase another unit.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. Just what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> I thought the mirror was great until I noticed that only one of the bulbs was working. I thought it just a problem with the bulb, but its electrical issue. I didn&#x27;t pay over $50 to have a mirror to be half working. I&#x27;ll be returning back soon.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for two years, I have used it almost daily with no problems. I have not even had to replace any bulbs yet!! While I like the durability of this mirror if I could change the dull yellow light it gives off this would definitely be a 5 star rating.I find myself putting on my foundation thinking I have everything blended and I used the proper shades only to go into my bathroom and find out my makeup looks like a hot mess!! I have even tried to find &amp;#34;true light&amp;#34; type of bulbs to replace the ones that came with the mirror with no luck.  Update: I ordered this mirror December 22, 2012 and toward the end of August 2016 the mirror stopped working. I think I just may need to replace the bulbs on the mirror. However I am just replacing the mirror because I rather have a mirror that mimics daylight.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough and was disappointed when it arrived and it had incandescent bulbs instead of LED.  My bad.  However, it did arrive with scratches and dings on the frame of the mirror.  Still debating on whether to keep or send back.</li>
    <li> I sincerely do not know what some reviewers are talking about. The light in this mirror is DIM. Yes, I know it is dimmable, but on full-blown it gives off very little light. Those who complained it was too bright must spend their days lying in a coffin waiting for night. If you&#x27;re using it, you should have another light source and it should be a pretty good one. I gave it 3 stars because I feel like it is well made, it came with 1 extra bulb (the lamp takes 2), it was reasonably priced and it looks pretty on my vanity.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have a bright enough light.  I was hoping for more brightness. Returned it.  My fault I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Like that it has dimmer. The lighting is good too. I bought a similar cheaper mirror at Costco but the lighting seemed to look like fluorescent lighting. I returned that one and bought this one which is much better!</li>
    <li> My only complaint about the mirror is that the light is not very bright.  If a lamp light or the mirror lights are on, it&#x27;s fine.  That being said, I had a mirror with stronger lights and if it was the sole light source, my eyes saw spots afterwards.  So maybe too bright is not good for the eyes.  I like the 8X magnification.  The height is good on top of the vanity so you don&#x27;t have to lean over so much. Good value.</li>
    <li> i really like the mirror. Perfect height to put makeup and contacts on. Nice look.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my wife to replace the one she had, and at a great price.</li>
    <li> This mirror is as well-made and heavy as I had expected. It is just beautiful and versitile.  The light is on a dimmer so my granddaughter uses it as a night light, as well as for makeup.</li>
    <li> Really nice 8x magnification. Also love it that it has an outlet so I can plug my flat iron into it. Gave it only for stars because the light is not very bright.</li>
    <li> Lopsided and dim.&lt;br /&gt;I had an earlier version that was much brighter, They have changed the bulb to a lessor quality, non halogen and it is not nearly as bright. The worst part is it is lop-sided. I have ordered 2 and on both of them the mirror leans to one side because the arm that holds it is slightly bent near the base stand. Maybe this is a manufacturing defect or a strange part of the design that I see no use for. Either way, I find it extremely distracting.</li>
    <li> The double-sided make-up mirror arrived on time and was exactly the item ordered.  Esthetically, the product is very nice.  The first time the unit was plugged in and turned on the ballast blew and the lights did not work.  Initial contact with company was cordial and they said they would send out two new bulbs, although it would be unusual for both bulbs to burn out at the same time, instead of instructing and facilitating sending the product back for an exchange.  The new bulbs arrived at our house and were replaced.  To no surprise, the bulbs did not work and now we will need to send the product back anyway.  Several week delay. Hope the company will be very helpful getting the new product to us.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to replace my old one that died recently.  It appears to be really well made and works great. The light is nice a bright and the magnification doesn&#x27;t distort.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The mirror part is fine, but what is with all these lighted makeup mirrors and their dim lights??? I wish it were a lot brighter. I was pretty disappointed actually, but I kept it and use it anyway.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a bedroom vanity and it&#x27;s perfect. I didn&#x27;t want a battery operated mirror, or a switch in the cord (those seem to be popular, but they are both pains-the batteries die and the cord switch is not convenient).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is heavy, so it shouldn&#x27;t get knocked over easily. The switch turns easily and is conveniently located on the front of the stand. The mirror swivels easily, but stays put when positioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is may not be the brightest, but does the job well. I don&#x27;t really have another mirror to compare it to. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s the only light in the room either, so it works well to put the light in front of your face instead of behind your head (in the bedroom) or beside you (lamp). It lights both sides of the mirror, which is nice.</li>
    <li> Mirrors were very good. Lighting was simply not bright enough to see much. Product was returned and will look for a better alternative.</li>
    <li> When my Conair double-sided mirror&#x27;s light burned out, it was nearly impossible to find the replacement bulb. So I gave up and ordered the Zadro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Zadro makeup mirror for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- High-quality double-sided mirrors&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent, bright, adjustable lighting (much better than Conair&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;- Electrical outlet in the base (very handy)&lt;br /&gt;- Good height if you are seated at a vanity table. It might be a bit on the short side when standing.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s heavy, indicating that it&#x27;s solid and made of durable materials&lt;br /&gt;- Mirror comes with a replacement bulb and these bulbs appear to be readily available&lt;br /&gt;- Good magnification at 8X&lt;br /&gt;- Attractive satin nickle finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives are few and minor:&lt;br /&gt;- The mirrors are horizontal ovals, which seems odd considering that faces are vertical ovals. It&#x27;s not an issue with the 1X side, but on the magnified side, you cannot see your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;- This mirror gets quite hot when left on the brightest setting. This is the trade-off for the mirror lamp&#x27;s brightness.&lt;br /&gt;- Zadro mirrors are a bit pricier than Conair, but by comparison, seem to be better quality.</li>
    <li> This mirror was a replacement for another mirror that &#x27;went out&#x27; .... the face of this mirror is so small I could barely see my own whole face in it.  Plus I realized that I could just buy bulb replacements for my current mirror instead of spending a fortune on a new one.</li>
    <li> I was offered to have a replacement but as it is difficult to use the side with X8 , I did not ask for another item.  I wish I could have found a 5x mirror but the ones I found do not have a dimmer.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this mirror except that it isn&#x27;t bright enough.  I looked all over and couldn&#x27;t find everything I wanted in a mirror, so didn&#x27;t want to hassle with returning it.</li>
    <li> The light on this mirror may illuminate your face if you&#x27;re in a totally dark room. But in any environment brighter than that, it simply is inadequate. The technical term, I believe, is: It sucks. Even the mirrors are not real. They&#x27;re shiny plastic inserts. Thinking about sending it back. I&#x27;m amazed that Amazon would carry this lousy product.</li>
    <li> I really like this lighted mirror, quite weighty which is good because it won&#x27;t knock over easily.  However, I ordered it in satin nickel finish &amp; it even said so on the box, but inside it was a brightly polished chrome mirror..  Because I did like the item, I figured it was too much of a hassle to return it, so I kept it.  I would have given 5 stars if I received the correct order!</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift.  Very satisfied.  The brushed nickel looks very nice and I like the varying light intensity.  It&#x27;s the right height for use with a vanity.  Only complaint would be that the light could be brighter and that is why I rated it a 4 of 5.  8x magnification is good.</li>
    <li> I give this a four it would get a five but the lighting is not that great, the magnification could be better if it was maybe a 6 or 7 however I&#x27;m used to a five magnification so you don&#x27;t have to be right up on it to get a clear view yet still get a close up. I like the additional outlet on the base and the finish is nice tho I&#x27;d prefer chrome. This is the closest I could get to what I needed in this type item. I&#x27;d recommend if you had additional lighting as I do. Plus if the lighting was better the adjusted lighting knob would actually be a nice function.</li>
    <li> i always used conari items, and i got this for my mom cuz i read this brand is betetr than conair.  the price was competitive, and even though the first oen i got was broken, they sent me a new one and i had it within 2 days.  great service.  the light is great and bright.  i also like how it has the on off switch on the base for convenience.  8x is perfect- just enough for my mom, as 10x was too much for her. haha.</li>
    <li> The first shipment came with the mirror cracked. I had tried to save a few cents by ordering from an alternate source that was fulfilled by Amazon. The package was not damaged, but the mirror inside was broken. I contacted Amazon and they immediately gave me return RO shipping labels. They credited my account within 2 days and I ordered another directly from Amazon. Got it 2 days later (Amazon Prime member). The 8X magnification is perfect for seeing REALLY close up. It was much larger that I expected, especially compared to my old mirror. the lighting could be a little brighter, but I have plenty of lighting in my bathroom so it is not a problem. I would recommend this for anyone that likes to be able to get a good look at all those pores and wants to get their brows really well tweezed. Any higher magnification and I would never get away from the mirror. Sometimes it is better to not be able to see every little imperfection!</li>
    <li> This items mirror is not very clear, and the height is much shorter than previous zadro 8x mirror I have.</li>
    <li> Light isn&#x27;t as bright as I thought it would be but my girlfriend liked it.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made unit.  So well made, I think I could will it to some vain descendent.  Also, heavy enough so it will be difficult to accidentally knock over.  I like the  on/off/dimmer switch right on the base of the unit.  Only wish the lighting could be a tad brighter, but it is bright enough to make a HUGE difference in my makeup application.  I don&#x27;t even want to imagine what my eyebrows looked like before I bought this.  I don&#x27;t know whether I would purchase this again due to the brightness issue -- i would probably shop around -- but I am very happy I bought this.  I think my vain descendants will be plenty pleased too.  Money was not wasted.</li>
    <li> And the light is too dim even at it&#x27;s highest light setting.  I returned it as it wasn&#x27;t very useful with these two issues.</li>
