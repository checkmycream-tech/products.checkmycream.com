<li> Well I usually don&#x27;t have much luck with them.  </li>

<li> My male clients say it&#x27;s comfy and they also appreciate that it&#x27;s thick enough to keep his &amp;#34;private&amp;#34; things &amp;#34;private!&amp;#34;</li>
<li> not worth the money i have returned it</li>
<li> Its a little longer than I like.</li>
<li> Very thin so, don&#x27;t be modest when wearing it.</li>
<li> It usually has sand hiding in the fabric.  </li>
<li> And usually slips or falls off when I&#x27;m walking.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed in the spa wrap.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34;. Its a little longer than I like. May take it up a couple of inches. Otherwise, perfect!</li>
    <li> The item did not fit appropriately.  It was returned.  The Item itself looked good and as advertised but did not fit a waist that it should.  The waist was ok but the side was too open for privacy.</li>
    <li> I have since gotten a similar product from a different company that I prefer, so in my opinion this one is just okay. It is not as comfortable as I had hope and the velcro strip seems a bit cheap.</li>

    <li> very nice item to use after a shower or lounging</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this shower wrap. The fabric was soft and even softer after washing. The length was perfect. I wish it came in sizes instead of one size fits all. The wearer is quite slender and the velcro closure just barely works for him. A good product and fairly priced.</li>
    <li> This is very nice and comfortable.  You can use these at the Gym while changing. easy to wash and care for</li>
    <li> I like it b/c it&#x27;s light weight and comfortable. I got it for around the house. It was a little smaller around the waist than I thought, but still works well.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the spa wrap.  It is very thin and looks very cheap.  I would not have ordered it if I know it was like this.</li>
    <li> The size is too small to fit a man bigger than a 30&amp;#34; or 32&amp;#34; waist. The quality and construction is very good.</li>
    <li> Undersized compared to others that are available. Very thin so, don&#x27;t be modest when wearing it. I&#x27;d look elsewhere for this item.</li>
    <li> this fabric is very thin and cheap - the velco is good, tho.  i wouldn&#x27;t have spent this much on such a flimsy material</li>

    <li> Love it, I use in the gym everytime i shower.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for when I&#x27;m leaving the beach and don&#x27;t want my car seat to get wet.  I know...&amp;#34;why not just wrap a beach towel around you and be done with it?&amp;#34;  Well I usually don&#x27;t have much luck with them.  The towel is already damp or wet from being used.  It usually has sand hiding in the fabric.  And usually slips or falls off when I&#x27;m walking.  Not this wrap.  It stays secured as a walk.  The waffle pattern adds a bit of a luxurious look and feel so it doesn&#x27;t look like a wrapped a beach towel around me.  And the pocket conveniently holds my car keys so there&#x27;s no digging around in the bag looking for them.</li>
