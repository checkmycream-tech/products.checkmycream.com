      <li>This is the best lip color tube that you will EVER get!</li>
      <li>Great price, too!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for keeping the lips moist.</li>
      <li>This is my best review ever given.</li>
      <li>This is the best lipstick I&#x27;ve found in my 76 years.  </li>
      <li>Cover girl has a great product.  </li>
      <li>This is a great price for a 2 pack of just the gloss.</li>
      <li>GREAT FOR ALL DAY USE, CARRYING IN YOUR PURSE OR YOUR CAR AND IS A GREAT MOISTURIZING GLOSS TO&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works as advertised, which is great.  </li>
      <li>also makes a great stand alone lip gloss without the color undercoat.</li>
      <li>This is a great replacement.</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy to find a supplier of this top coat, since it appears to be discontinued</li>
      <li>I will be buying more soon!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>and I think this is the best i have used so far.</li>
      <li>Its very smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling to it.</li>
      <li>I would gladly get more of this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it on sale</li>
      <li>But it has more of a gloss to it, instead of being waxy, and it works well over color when I do choose to wear lipstick under it.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it as a top coat for my outlast lipstick, yet, but I guess I&#x27;ll give that a shot before I depot it and add some flavoring rather than toss it.</li>
      <li>You will love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>One needs more of this product than the paint color.  </li>
      <li>First, I love covergirl outlast!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it works for all day with their lip color since I use it mostly by itself, but I know that its the perfect combo between chapstick and lip gloss.</li>
      <li>This one is really good.&lt;br /&gt;Gives nice shine on your lips while moisturing them.</li>
      <li>This product had a very distinct smell and taste...</li>
      <li>This does give you a nice shine over your lip color but for me it didn&#x27;t make my lip color last any more than before.</li>
      <li>i use them directly on my lips and they give nice juicy lips</li>
      <li>its super lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel tacky on my lips.</li>
      <li>or before I apply my super shining lip gloss.</li>
      <li>Definetely worth buying.</li>
      <li>I use this prodcut by itself without the color as a basic gloss, it is smooth and silky and I love it.</li>
      <li>I really love this soft gloss stick.</li>
      <li>Keep lip paint color fresh looking  and lips from drying out.  </li>
      <li>Be warned though, these tubes don&#x27;t have much product so they get used quickly.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m familiar with this product, I&#x27;ve been satisfied with other suppliers and the</li>
      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
      <li>very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to re-apply it unless I have eaten a very greasy meal.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m having trouble finding the colors that work for me since colors are trendy and are not continually produced by the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>The trick to this product success is applying it to clean dry lips and wait a couple minutes before applying the clear gloss stick.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and only wish that my local drug stores still carried it!</li>
      <li>Only way to keep your lips looking fresh all day</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the time we live in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really a lipstick wearer-only for special occasions.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special or long lasting about it.</li>
      <li>I keep the gloss stick with me at all times and reuse it frequently during the day.  </li>
      <li>I have tried every brand with the same claims and found that ONLY \\&quot;OUTLAST\\&quot; really outlasts the others!  </li>
      <li>They are the exact same product in different packaging.  </li>
      <li>so it wasn&#x27;t a major loss.</li>
      <li>I always run out of the clear lip gloss before the actually lip color.</li>
      <li>Tried many other more expensive brands but for the cost and coverage, this beats them hands down.  </li>
      <li>I really like it and often wear it over other lipsticks as well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Never have enough when I buy the color/cover in stores.</li>
    <li> I love this product and only wish that my local drug stores still carried it! also makes a great stand alone lip gloss without the color undercoat.</li>
    <li> Absolutely necessary I f you use all day lipstick</li>
    <li> First, I love covergirl outlast!  I have been using the product for about 10 years.  I have tried every brand with the same claims and found that ONLY \\&quot;OUTLAST\\&quot; really outlasts the others!  I apply it once in the morning and never repeat the color portion till the next day.  The trick to this product success is applying it to clean dry lips and wait a couple minutes before applying the clear gloss stick.  I keep the gloss stick with me at all times and reuse it frequently during the day.  LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m familiar with this product, I&#x27;ve been satisfied with other suppliers and the I&#x27;d say the same for this one</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for keeping the lips moist.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast!  Love it!  Thanks!  These gloss sticks are the only thing that works with the Covergirl OUTLAST!  I will be buying more soon!</li>
    <li> Have used this product a number of years.  Tried many other more expensive brands but for the cost and coverage, this beats them hands down.  I now use this product alone even without lipstick to keep in moisture.  Be warned though, these tubes don&#x27;t have much product so they get used quickly.</li>
    <li> Only way to keep your lips looking fresh all day</li>
    <li> This is the best lipstick I&#x27;ve found in my 76 years.  I don&#x27;t have to re-apply it unless I have eaten a very greasy meal. I just reapply the gloss a couple of times a day.  Now I&#x27;m having trouble finding the colors that work for me since colors are trendy and are not continually produced by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This product had a very distinct smell and taste... I&#x27;m really not impressed. I&#x27;m glad I got it on sale so it wasn&#x27;t a major loss. I haven&#x27;t tried it as a top coat for my outlast lipstick, yet, but I guess I&#x27;ll give that a shot before I depot it and add some flavoring rather than toss it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a lipstick wearer-only for special occasions.  But I do wear lip balm daily.  I love this product.  For me it moisturizes like lip balm-I reapply this throughtout the day. But it has more of a gloss to it, instead of being waxy, and it works well over color when I do choose to wear lipstick under it.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip color tube that you will EVER get! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find a supplier of this top coat, since it appears to be discontinued and I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  Great price, too!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Use this if you want the colour to stay longer on your lips. Try to press your lips against a white (whichever, maybe a cloth or something) and it will not have stains at all.</li>
    <li> This lip care works wonders for your lips,  it&#x27;s moisturizing sofen the lips and protects as it smooths your lips from the outside cold weather as well.</li>
    <li> It says package of 2 ....bottles and it is tubes..you can look and see it is tubes.  I wanted total of 2 tubes for the $7 advertised and then another 2 tubes for another $7 and they sent me 2 tubes and charged me $14.  Packaged incorrectely</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Cover girl has a great product.  I just wish the price wouldn&#x27;t keep climbing.  I know - it&#x27;s the time we live in.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is also a lot cheaper on Amazon than buying it outright at the store. One big thing is buying it at the store I can&#x27;t find this by itself anymore. Its always with a shade of lip color. I want it by itself. I&#x27;m not sure if it works for all day with their lip color since I use it mostly by itself, but I know that its the perfect combo between chapstick and lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Put on the lipstick in the morning, then all you have to carry with you, is the matching lip gloss!</li>
    <li> I bought this as my lips are really very dry. This one is really good.&lt;br /&gt;Gives nice shine on your lips while moisturing them. Not too expensive. Definetely worth buying. I am a regular freq buyer of products on Amazon. This is my best review ever given. Trust me. You will love it. i use them directly on my lips and they give nice juicy lips appearence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 16hrs of lasting not really as advertised but will last for sometime. You need to keep applying over and over.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Keep lip paint color fresh looking  and lips from drying out.  Works as advertised, which is great.  I like that&lt;br /&gt;these come in packs of two.  One needs more of this product than the paint color.  Wish it came in a shimmer version, also, rather than just the gloss.</li>
    <li> I have been using Covergirl Outlast and Max Factor Lipfinity since the 90&#x27;s. They are the exact same product in different packaging.  This is the lip gloss that goes with them.  I really like it and often wear it over other lipsticks as well.  This is a great price for a 2 pack of just the gloss.</li>
    <li> I really love this soft gloss stick. Its very smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling to it. I would gladly get more of this once I&#x27;m finished with my other 2</li>
    <li> I just love it. very moisturizing. I used it as lip balm and I think this is the best i have used so far.</li>
    <li> This clear CoverGirl lipcolor didn&#x27;t outlast any other product I&#x27;ve used for the same purpose.  I would say it&#x27;s not worth purchasing if you expect it to last longer.  I would not purchase this product again.  Nothing special or long lasting about it.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR ALL DAY USE, CARRYING IN YOUR PURSE OR YOUR CAR AND IS A GREAT MOISTURIZING GLOSS TO&lt;br /&gt;WEAR OVER OTHER LIPSTICKS.</li>
    <li> Just like store bought</li>
    <li> I use this prodcut by itself without the color as a basic gloss, it is smooth and silky and I love it.</li>
    <li> This does give you a nice shine over your lip color but for me it didn&#x27;t make my lip color last any more than before. If anything I needed to reapply sooner than usual.</li>
    <li> This adds just the right amount of shine to my lips and protects them from the dry and cold at the same time. I&#x27;ve replaced all my lip balm (except the UV stuff for the summer) with these, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I always run out of the clear lip gloss before the actually lip color. This is a great replacement. It works well, and Amazon&#x27;s price is cheaper than the drugstore&#x27;s. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m a lip gloss junkie.  I have the really expensive, to the really cheap.  I have this lip color at work, in the car, make up bag, and at my bedside.  I like that its super lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel tacky on my lips. Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t smell.  I wear it alone or before I apply my super shining lip gloss.</li>
