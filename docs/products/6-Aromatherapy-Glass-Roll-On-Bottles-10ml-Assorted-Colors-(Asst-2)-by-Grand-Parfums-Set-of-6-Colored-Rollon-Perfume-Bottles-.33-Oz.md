      <li>I love those bottles.  </li>
      <li>I love the colors.</li>
      <li>Love these roll on bottles &amp; colors.</li>
      <li>Pretty good quality.</li>
      <li>But for personal use, if you don&#x27;t care that they aren&#x27;t perfect  - it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Good price; fast delivery.</li>
      <li>It makes it so easy.</li>
      <li>It was easy to fill.  </li>
      <li>I hope this helps someone, because I almost returned them and this is an easy fix.</li>
      <li>These rollerball glass bottles are perfect for essential oils and the colors are so fun.</li>
      <li>These are beautiful 10 ml bottles to blend essential oils in.</li>
      <li>Works best if you scribble the rollerball on a damp sponge or foundation brush and apply it properly- less like me the trowel</li>
      <li>I ran it around the rim a few times and the rollers then worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>Some of the lids don&#x27;t screw on straight and it looks kind of dorky.</li>
      <li>These are cheaply made.</li>
      <li>The oil goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Nice for easily finding the essential oils mixtures that she creates.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
      <li>Great little set of Glass bottles.  </li>
      <li>All of the other bottles I ordered are very pretty and the colors are gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>The caps are a squeeze to get on, but go on just right.</li>
      <li>Suffice for my need right now, but my suggestion is to purchase the metal roller balls for durability and ease of use.</li>
      <li>They are working fine so far though.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect something amazing and don&#x27;t expect high enough quality that you would consider giving away an oil blend in them as a gift.</li>
      <li>I love these bottles for making roller bottle mixes of essential oils.</li>
      <li>Love these for my homemade essential oil blends -- colors help me keep track of which one is which!</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll splurge for something better.</li>
      <li>I filled the entire bottle with a really pretty gloss that I can just roll on my lips or on my finger then lips.</li>
      <li>I have used just one of them so far and it is very pretty purple.  </li>
      <li>Live and learn, right?</li>
      <li>I also liked that you gave me the little things to fill them with and all matching caps.  </li>
      <li>I really like the quality of these glass roll-on bottles.</li>
      <li>These make a fantastic incentive for essential oil classes too.</li>
      <li>So far the few I&#x27;ve used are working good.  </li>
      <li>had tons of those crank up lip glosses with the brush built in, with like at the most 8 cranks left - maybe enough for 2-5 applications.</li>
      <li>They help me to quickly see which essential oil blend is in the bottle.</li>
      <li>The lids do not fit snug and one bottle had a line all around the bottle from bottom to top.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure something similar could be used as well as long as it doesn&#x27;t damage the roller or surrounding plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>used the flat side of a wooden orange stick (the kind used to push back cuticles) and ran it between the roller ball and the plastic part that encircles the ball.</li>
      <li>Love the colors but the rollers are really stiff.</li>
      <li>The tops don&#x27;t seem to fit as snug as other roller bottles and the tops feels like cheap plastic compared to the other ones I bought.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d return them if I was within the time window but with a new baby I had just missed the window.</li>
      <li>In initially bought another of their listings on recommendation of a certified aromatherapist, and ordered these because I love my other ones and my kids cracked one of them, so it was time to replace it as well.</li>
      <li>but hey its works and all these big bulky and messy things are out of my makeup galloon zipper bag and into a cute leopard print REAL makeup bag.</li>
      <li>I filled one and gave to my daughter-in-law to use on her little girl..</li>
      <li>The glass is actually clear..</li>
      <li>I have had these a week I am using 3 so far.</li>
      <li>One of these bottles at whole foods ( the blue one) with out a roller ball - is 8$- 12$.</li>
      <li>I really like the different colors.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not totally satisfied with are the lids, they seem to not be made quite precise for the threads on the bottle or the two materials</li>
      <li>Keeps loose shimmer powder under control ( usually I find loose shimmer powder just gets everywhere no matter how many zipper bags and strapping the container with packing tape- its still everywhere- like the way glitter can be.</li>
      <li>The caps are all straight except for one which has a slight slant to it when it&#x27;s on (the last order I got from another company</li>

    <li> Arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love those bottles.  Good quality!</li>
    <li> The tops don&#x27;t seem to fit as snug as other roller bottles and the tops feels like cheap plastic compared to the other ones I bought.  Also,the dark green bottle paint was peeling a little.</li>
    <li> These are super nice! I am using these for my oils and crafting purposes as well.</li>
    <li> Great product fun colors.</li>
    <li> Great little set of Glass bottles.  Good price; fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if all glass is possible but my oils instructions say NOT to put them in plastic and the roller is plastic.  They are working fine so far though.</li>
    <li> Great.  Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> These are working lovely!!! They were well packed and now i can color code my roller oils.</li>
    <li> Love the bottles, but 3/6 roller balls have fallen out of the roller base. They don&#x27;t go back in. Bummer!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my cousin. She loves oils. She also has hives on her hands.......supposedly NOT from the oils. She only diffuses them, she says. Anyways, the roll on bottles are good quality and excellent for essential oils because they&#x27;re glass. The different colors helps her distinguish the different blends she makes and they hold quite a bit.</li>
    <li> So far the few I&#x27;ve used are working good.  Good price and they all shipped intact.</li>
    <li> These rollerball glass bottles are perfect for essential oils and the colors are so fun. Me and my daughters use them daily. The different colors help us know which oils we use. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Love these for my homemade essential oil blends -- colors help me keep track of which one is which!</li>
    <li> I love these bottles for making roller bottle mixes of essential oils. Color coded so I always know which I&#x27;m grabbing. The only thing I&#x27;m not totally satisfied with are the lids, they seem to not be made quite precise for the threads on the bottle or the two materials don&#x27;t. The lid scrapes the bottle as I twist it on. They still work, I just worry over a little time they may not last.</li>
    <li> The colors are painted on.. The glass is actually clear.. Not sure how they will hold up.</li>
    <li> The pipette looks like it came from a dollar store. I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t even work. It&#x27;s just OK.... but I wish it was of better quality. I may go to the craft store and replace it. Some of the lids don&#x27;t screw on straight and it looks kind of dorky. I&#x27;m just hoping it doesn&#x27;t leak out all over. These are cheaply made. Don&#x27;t expect something amazing and don&#x27;t expect high enough quality that you would consider giving away an oil blend in them as a gift. But for personal use, if you don&#x27;t care that they aren&#x27;t perfect  - it&#x27;s fine. Live and learn, right? Next time I&#x27;ll splurge for something better.</li>
    <li> These are beautiful 10 ml bottles to blend essential oils in. Just add your own special stickers for a personalized touch! The roller balls are easy to put on and work great! These make a fantastic incentive for essential oil classes too.</li>
    <li> I really like the different colors.  I can see at a glance which one I want, though I do put sticker on it to show what is in the bottle.  I filled one and gave to my daughter-in-law to use on her little girl..I gave her the pink one.  :)</li>
    <li> WHAT A GREAT DEAL. One of these bottles at whole foods ( the blue one) with out a roller ball - is 8$- 12$. Totally insane. These are pretty, made of glass-but very thick not easily breakable AT ALL, with a roller ball that you can pop on it, or keep it a pour bottle. Great for the purse. Another secret i use them for besides fragrance, is loose shimmer powder with the roller on. I can glide it over my lids and high points of mightier bones, and run a little shimmer over my clavicle bones. Keeps loose shimmer powder under control ( usually I find loose shimmer powder just gets everywhere no matter how many zipper bags and strapping the container with packing tape- its still everywhere- like the way glitter can be. This way of using it is so perfect and just applies enough. I also ( embarrassing slightly ) had tons of those crank up lip glosses with the brush built in, with like at the most 8 cranks left - maybe enough for 2-5 applications. Since they are all pink, pinkish, and pinkity pink pink.. I gathered up all ( 15) of them and cranked them all into a rollerball bottle. I filled the entire bottle with a really pretty gloss that I can just roll on my lips or on my finger then lips. Thats quite a lot of gloss that I would have just thrown out. I also put my foundation in a rollerball, it takes up no room in a makeup bag, and in a pinch I roll a bit onto my finger or just under my eyes and blend it in. Works best if you scribble the rollerball on a damp sponge or foundation brush and apply it properly- less like me the trowel queen-- but hey its works and all these big bulky and messy things are out of my makeup galloon zipper bag and into a cute leopard print REAL makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping your oils organized.  Roller balls are all white, not colored as shown.</li>
    <li> Rollers are a little stiff at first</li>
    <li> Love these roll on bottles &amp; colors. Great transaction..</li>
    <li> If I could give 10 stars, I would. Shipped and delivered in under a week, and I&#x27;ve bought from them before, and their quality is great as well. In initially bought another of their listings on recommendation of a certified aromatherapist, and ordered these because I love my other ones and my kids cracked one of them, so it was time to replace it as well.</li>
    <li> I like this. I used them for diluting essential oils. However, one of the roller balls is too stiff to function so thats frustrating.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It arrived very quickly!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product. I have been using them for over a month and have had no problems with leaking or the roller balls falling out as I have read is a problem with some of the other roller bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I did have trouble with the balls being stiff the day they were shipped and was so frustrated and disappointed because I loved the bottles and colors. I decided to try to loosen them and what I did worked perfectly and immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I used the flat side of a wooden orange stick (the kind used to push back cuticles) and ran it between the roller ball and the plastic part that encircles the ball. I ran it around the rim a few times and the rollers then worked perfectly. They are not too loose or to tight. The oil goes on smoothly. I hope this helps someone, because I almost returned them and this is an easy fix. I&#x27;m sure something similar could be used as well as long as it doesn&#x27;t damage the roller or surrounding plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love the colors. They help me to quickly see which essential oil blend is in the bottle. I put the DoTerra Deep Blue in the blue bottle, Lavender in the purple, peppermint in the green. It makes it so easy. My kids love having access to the diluted oils when they have a tummy ache or a booboo to be able to put it on themselves.</li>
    <li> I LOVED THE COLORS. THEY WERE A GREAT HIT. BUT THE PLASTIC STOPPERS OR ROLLON&#x27;SDO NOT WORK WITH CITRUS OILS OR HIGHER&lt;br /&gt;ACIDIC ONES</li>
    <li> Rollers are plastic and tend to not roll well. Bought to mix up Essential Oils. Suffice for my need right now, but my suggestion is to purchase the metal roller balls for durability and ease of use. The lids do not fit snug and one bottle had a line all around the bottle from bottom to top. However, colors are nice.</li>
    <li> I have had these a week I am using 3 so far. Love the colors but the rollers are really stiff. I am hoping they loosen up. Would give 5 stars if not for that.</li>
    <li> My package arrived with a slip inside that said: &amp;#34;Avoid using with Frankincense or citrus oils&amp;#34;  - unfortunately this is what I purchased them for (it does not say this in the item description).  They leak with these oils.  I&#x27;d return them if I was within the time window but with a new baby I had just missed the window.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product .</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality. Came on time and there was no damage. I like the colors.</li>
    <li> I really like the quality of these glass roll-on bottles. The caps are a squeeze to get on, but go on just right. They roll perfectly for my essential oil mixes with coconut oil. The caps are all straight except for one which has a slight slant to it when it&#x27;s on (the last order I got from another company ALL the tops were slanted so this is much better).</li>
    <li> I have used just one of them so far and it is very pretty purple.  It was easy to fill.  All of the other bottles I ordered are very pretty and the colors are gorgeous.  They came quickly and were packaged very nicely and well protected.  I also liked that you gave me the little things to fill them with and all matching caps.  I will order from you again, thank you.</li>
    <li> I like these roller bottles. No issues.</li>
    <li> Nice for easily finding the essential oils mixtures that she creates.</li>
