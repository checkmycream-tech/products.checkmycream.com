      <li>Great and strong fragrance for women</li>
      <li>Not my kind.</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s quite potent one squirt should be good.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this beautiful perfume from Aedes de Venustas, and I had to have a whole bottle.</li>
      <li>PROBABLY WOULD PURCHASE MORE IN FUTURE,BUT</li>
      <li>Lovely and sensual fragrance, I am pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>My wife and I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Lovely scent.</li>
      <li>so glad I found it.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Lalique de Lalique is a favorite</li>
      <li>Love the product</li>
      <li>.I would almost have to say it is a unisex scent I love it , ,</li>
      <li>Great classic fragrance.</li>
      <li>is I would have liked to know more in detail about the scent and how mild or strong it is.  </li>
      <li>Too strong...</li>
      <li>THE ITEM WAS FINE</li>
      <li>I have purchased it for my cousins and they enjoy it to this day.  </li>
      <li>So happy that I can buy Lalique fragrances on Amazon at such an affordable price!</li>
      <li>Great fragrance for daily use</li>
      <li>Light, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Perles de Lalique is light and beautiful initially but disappears quickly without a trace.  .</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is ridiculously good for a niche French perfume of this size.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sultry and sexy any time of the year and wears well.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it for fans of the perfume! :)</li>
      <li>Will order more from this vendor Fast shipping</li>
      <li>The shipping is quickly Thank you</li>
      <li>I have always purchased french colognes and for the most part they are not as strong as others.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a fresh after shave kinda smell.</li>
      <li>the patchouli is very strong ,very mossy wood scent musky , masculine scent  </li>
      <li>Soft and sweet.</li>
      <li>VERY MINDFULL OF THE COST.</li>
      <li>This scent is a favorite because it lasts and isn&#x27;t your typical floral scent.</li>
      <li>This french cologne is mild and lingering.</li>
      <li>she is wearing , I find most of the time its a woman&#x27;s signature scent and not easily shared .</li>
      <li>usually never ask a woman</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually unable to wear fragrances at all, normally only wearing essential oil blends, but this scent is perfect and completely wearable.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money</li>
      <li>It is mature and will make a statement on whomever is wearing it.</li>
      <li>I first encountered Perles de Lalique when a statures on my plain was coming back to the states from Paris  .&lt;br</li>
      <li>only complaint is that this large bottle eau de parfume hasn&#x27;t nearly the silliage or the staying power of the sample, which I could smell on my night clothes days later, this one is gone in a couple of hours.</li>

<li> BUT THE PRICE WAS A LITTLE HIGH.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Was having hard time locating product in store</li>
<li> Although I adore Eau De Lalique, Perles De Lalique was a disappointment for me.</li>

    <li> Lovely and sensual fragrance, I am pleased with this product.  The shipping time&lt;br /&gt;was very quick and packaging was excellent.  I would recommend this seller and I personally would buy again from them.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would like to mention about the fragrance is I would have liked to know more in detail about the scent and how mild or strong it is.  I have always purchased french colognes and for the most part they are not as strong as others. I am very careful when I buy cologne because to someone else it could be very different. This french cologne is mild and lingering.</li>
    <li> El perfume que solicite es una frangancia exquisita, y no es muy comercial en donde vivo, afortunadamente encontre su pagina y lo consegui... gracias</li>
    <li> Great classic fragrance.</li>
    <li> Lalique de Lalique is a favorite so I wanted to try another.  Even though I read the review,critical of its &amp;#34;silliage&amp;#34; or staying power, I bought anyway.  Wish I had just stuck with he former.  Perles de Lalique is light and beautiful initially but disappears quickly without a trace.  .</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this product.  I have purchased it for my cousins and they enjoy it to this day.  I love to keep my ladies happy!!</li>
    <li> Love the product Great price just what I asked for.  Was having hard time locating product in store so glad I found it.  Will order more from this vendor Fast shipping</li>
    <li> IT IS THE MOST SENSUAL, BEAUTIFUL  GODD SMELL A WOMAN  CAN HAVE.... THAT IS MY ONE AND ONLY  PERFUM !</li>
    <li> Great and strong fragrance for women and it could be wear for men as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this scent at Neiman Marcus years ago. This price is less than half of what I paid. It&#x27;s very sultry and sexy any time of the year and wears well. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Smell like man cologne. My husband could not tolerate this. I had to discard it. Do not waste your money</li>
    <li> This price is a great value for a lovely fragrance. Would highly recommend it for fans of the perfume! :)</li>
    <li> I first encountered Perles de Lalique when a statures on my plain was coming back to the states from Paris  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually never ask a woman what perfume  she is wearing , I find most of the time its a woman&#x27;s signature scent and not easily shared . for 5 years I swore too one day buy the perfume . I finally made the purchases on Amazon the scent is everything as dreamy as I had remembered it to be  the patchouli is very strong ,very mossy wood scent musky , masculine scent  .I would almost have to say it is a unisex scent I love it , ,</li>
    <li> THE ITEM WAS FINE BUT THE PRICE WAS A LITTLE HIGH.&lt;br /&gt;I PROBABLY WOULD PURCHASE MORE IN FUTURE,BUT VERY MINDFULL OF THE COST.</li>
    <li> A great Mother&#x27;s Day gift!  Soft and sweet. A fragrance that can be worn all year long. No lotion or bath gel needed.</li>
    <li> just want I wanted,  went to a party and someone was wearing this perfume.  I just had to have it.  It is great!</li>
    <li> Lovely scent. Light, not overpowering. Perfect for Patchouli lovers who can&#x27;t wear the heady stuff. I&#x27;m usually unable to wear fragrances at all, normally only wearing essential oil blends, but this scent is perfect and completely wearable.</li>
    <li> Meh. It&#x27;s got a fresh after shave kinda smell. Not my kind. I prefer richer smells. Also it&#x27;s quite potent one squirt should be good. Don&#x27;t think it last very long though</li>
    <li> Wonderful purchase experience.</li>

But while it lasts, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Although I adore Eau De Lalique, Perles De Lalique was a disappointment for me. Too medicinal, too peppery, too masculine to my nose. I&#x27;m a lover of unisex fragrances, but this one simply doesn&#x27;t work for me. Too strong... Such a shame...</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just awesome. This fragrance takes you to paradise. It is mature and will make a statement on whomever is wearing it.</li>
    <li> this perfume smells delicious fragrance is my favorite I love it I like a lot  lasts all day is a jewel The shipping is quickly Thank you</li>
    <li> Yet another Lalique fragrance that has become my favorite!  So happy that I can buy Lalique fragrances on Amazon at such an affordable price!</li>
