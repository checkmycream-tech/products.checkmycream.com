      <li>Awesome tweezers.</li>
      <li>Best tweezers in the world.  </li>
      <li>bobbi brown tweezer are best. ..</li>
      <li>These are great tweezers that provide great quality and durability.  </li>
      <li>Theese are not those, tweezerman makes great products you wont be didapointed in theese.</li>
      <li>and it still works great.</li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>and they do a great job.</li>
      <li>I had always heard how great Tweezerman tweezers were</li>
      <li>I was hoping they would be great...</li>
      <li>I gave this product 3 stars because I know they can make a great pair of tweezers, just not reliably.</li>
      <li>the best, it seems to be more versatile.  </li>
      <li>Tweezerman are the best, they are simply so precise.</li>
      <li>Just buy a good one, like this.</li>
      <li>But these right here are great, nice grip wonderful tension on the press and  nice angled slant!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with these tweezers - they have exceeded my expectations.  </li>
      <li>Really good for gripping.</li>
      <li>This has a good grip for grasping the most stubborn hair.</li>
      <li>Cheap tweezers from the drug store would have been as good.  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s ok, because it&#x27;s a tweezer.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem able to grab a hair as well as the slant tip.</li>
      <li>I love her pair, too.     </li>
      <li>and I was able to pull out the hairs that I wanted plucked.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended &amp; satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Tweezerman is a great product.</li>
      <li>I found the tweezer easy to hold</li>
      <li>any of the cheap drugstore tweezers.</li>
      <li>I have purchased Tweezerman tweezers before spending about the same amount and received a superior product.  </li>
      <li>Tweezerman Stainless Steel Pointed Slant Tweezer  is not my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the pointed slant was a good choice on my behalf, in my experience it definitely gets the micro-hairs and any hair you wish with incredible accuracy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to buy several of them, because my kids, liked them better than what they were using, and my disappeared ;)  </li>
      <li>I recently tried different brands of tweezers; I have come to the conclusion that for me Tweezerman has the best performance tweezers.</li>
      <li>I rated this Tweezer 5 stars because it is extremly accurate, sharp when I need it to be at the tip, easy to use, comes with a plastic cover to protect the tip of the tweezer - overall a great product.</li>
      <li>I have an old pair of Revlon that do a much better job than these.  </li>
      <li>I also recently purchased the Tweezerman Stainless Steel Pointed Slant Tweezers to give it a try, I was excited at first because it pulled out the finest hairs on my face, I have use them every day since I purchased them, the performance of the tweezers diminished over time, they still work, but not as good as when I first bought them.</li>
      <li>Tweezerman makes great tweezers but these are not very good.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I have not been able to get a good pair myself.</li>
      <li>Still pretty sharp and better</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended!  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t take much hair out</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t really perform better than my other lower cost tweezers.  </li>
      <li>They are still better than, other brands</li>
      <li>The product was as described, but as far as tweezers go stay away if you&#x27;re using these on yourself (especially if you have fine hairs).</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad they haven&#x27;t wore down at all.</li>
      <li>However if you wish to use the slant size it more often cuts hair in half, so you will have to be taking your time there with these tweezers rather than powering through your normal routine.</li>
      <li>so I had high expectations.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this tweezers.</li>
      <li>I bought these to replace an old pair of Rubis combination tweezers, but they just don&#x27;t compare.  </li>
      <li>The tip is very precise, able to grab very short hair but not so sharp that it would cut or break off the hair (a problem I had with other tweezers in the past).</li>
      <li>Have played around with cheap tweezers for years that only half work.  </li>
      <li>B000782SQY Tweezerman Stainless Steel Point Tweezer in Assorted Colors]]Went back and bought a second pair.</li>
      <li>I love tweezerman, but find this style has to be pinched very hard in order to grab the hair.</li>
      <li>When I use to buy cheap tweezers, I had to buy them at least once a month then toss them.</li>
      <li>I will send them for free sharpening (as that is a benefit) but they should at least start out that way.</li>
      <li>The slant is too oblique for me; I can barely catch anything.  </li>
      <li>just as somebody else said, these only met at the tip, not down the rest of the slant.  </li>
      <li>Ok we know not all tweezers work well, in fact some are so bad there not worth getting them for free.</li>

<li> There&#x27;s really no bells and whistles on this tweezer, it tweezes, as advertised, that&#x27;s it.</li>
<li> I have had a pair of pink Tweezerman&#x27;s for a year.</li>
<li> I have spent a lot of money over the years on tweezers.</li>
<li> Do you now that tweezers are a very personal and necessary grooming item to purchase and yet very little attention are paid to the dynamics of its structure!</li>
<li> No more bloody face or neck from regular tweezers that aren&#x27;t strong enough and just tear the skin.</li>
<li> Sharp edge to get the hairs barley poking out of the skin.</li>
<li> i wish i got the other style from tweezerman as ive never had an issue with them.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d recommend every and any other model of Tweezerman tweezers over these.</li>
<li> Tweezerman has really gone down in quality - extremely rough metal - which is very irritating to my skin.  </li>
<li> (My Rubis still work, but are a little beat because I used them for things other than the intended use.)  </li>
<li> I have been using this for over a year and a half</li>
<li> and now I go to salon less for waxing.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s not equally as fine as any other tweezer...</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste time with another brand.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on those junky drugstore tweezers.</li>
<li> I returned them, but had to remind the seller to refund my money, since it hadn&#x27;t appeared after a few weeks.  </li>
<li> A little hard to use.</li>
<li> There is no better tweezers&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
<li> Nothing bad to say about it it other than I wish it came in different colors!</li>
<li> In the long run, you&#x27;ll save money and won&#x27;t be frustrated.</li>
<li> Not a happy experience.</li>
<li> Not happy.</li>
<li> I have plenty of Tweezerman tweezers, these are by far the worst.</li>
<li> It requires a lot of pressure to grab the hair, and it&#x27;s really difficult and uncomfortable to do it on yourself.</li>
<li> If you get a pair you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
<li> I was so disappointed.  </li>
<li> Helps get the hair and the root and isn&#x27;t very painful.</li>
<li> They are horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My sister has a pair of these and loves them. I love her pair, too.     Unfortunately, I have not been able to get a good pair myself. The one I ordered from Amazon was defective - the tweezer only met at the tippy point, not all along the slanted edge as it&#x27;s supposed to. Amazon sent a replacement and that, too was defective.     I gave this product 3 stars because I know they can make a great pair of tweezers, just not reliably. I would suggest purchasing these from a retail location so you can inspect the pair before you take it home.</li>
    <li> I had always heard how great Tweezerman tweezers were so I had high expectations.  They don&#x27;t really perform better than my other lower cost tweezers.  I think that they need to be sharpened already and they just arrived!  I will send them for free sharpening (as that is a benefit) but they should at least start out that way.</li>
    <li> I found the tweezer easy to hold and I was able to pull out the hairs that I wanted plucked.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year and a half and it still works great. The tip is very precise, able to grab very short hair but not so sharp that it would cut or break off the hair (a problem I had with other tweezers in the past).</li>

These tweezers do last a long time so I&#x27;m glad they haven&#x27;t wore down at all.</li>
    <li> I rolled the dice on this purchase after reading the mixed reviews.  I have an old pair of Revlon that do a much better job than these.  I was so disappointed.  I was hoping they would be great...not so.  But maybe it&#x27;s just me!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like them wish I could return it doesn&#x27;t take much hair out money lost bobbi brown tweezer are best. ..</li>
    <li> These were a replacement for another pair I&#x27;d damaged. Tweezerman are the best, they are simply so precise. I wouldn&#x27;t waste time with another brand.</li>
    <li> Awesome tweezers. Sharp edge to get the hairs barley poking out of the skin. Highly recommended &amp; satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Tweezerman is a great product.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman makes great tweezers but these are not very good. They break the hairs instead of pulling them out. No bueno.</li>
    <li> This has a good grip for grasping the most stubborn hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money on those junky drugstore tweezers. They don&#x27;t work. Just buy a good one, like this. In the long run, you&#x27;ll save money and won&#x27;t be frustrated.</li>
    <li> These were a huge disappointment. I had a tweezer for years and lost it. I got these as a replacement. They are horrible. They won&#x27;t grab correctly, don&#x27;t seem to be aligned properly. Won&#x27;t buy Tweezerman brand anymore.</li>
    <li> Ok we know not all tweezers work well, in fact some are so bad there not worth getting them for free. Theese are not those, tweezerman makes great products you wont be didapointed in theese.</li>
    <li> A little hard to use.</li>
    <li> I have spent a lot of money over the years on tweezers. There is no better tweezers&lt;br /&gt;Then TWEEZERMAN! They will even sharpen them for you after you have used them&lt;br /&gt;A bunch of times. When I use to buy cheap tweezers, I had to buy them at least once a month then toss them. I have had a pair of pink Tweezerman&#x27;s for a year. Still pretty sharp and better&lt;br /&gt;Then any of the cheap drugstore tweezers. If you get a pair you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have plenty of Tweezerman tweezers, these are by far the worst.

    <li> I have used Tweeerman twizzers for years.  I&#x27;ve had to buy several of them, because my kids, liked them better than what they were using, and my disappeared ;)  I like the Pointed Slant Tweezer the best, it seems to be more versatile.  Highly Recommended!  Probably going to get a spare, just in case!</li>
    <li> My husband has horrible ingrown hair and these tweezers work great. No more bloody face or neck from regular tweezers that aren&#x27;t strong enough and just tear the skin. He loves them</li>
    <li> Tweezerman Stainless Steel Pointed Slant Tweezer  is not my favorite.  Doesn&#x27;t seem able to grab a hair as well as the slant tip.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace an old pair of Rubis combination tweezers, but they just don&#x27;t compare.  (My Rubis still work, but are a little beat because I used them for things other than the intended use.)  The Tweezerman tip is larger, and doesn&#x27;t come together as well.  The stainless steel material is not as heavy as the Rubis.  They might do the job, but I returned them and will order another Rubis for the quality.  These measure approx. 3 3/4\\&quot; length.</li>
    <li> Really good for gripping. I highly recommend this tweezers. I will never use another brand. Helps get the hair and the root and isn&#x27;t very painful.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really no bells and whistles on this tweezer, it tweezes, as advertised, that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s not equally as fine as any other tweezer...there&#x27;s just nothing that sets apart...but that&#x27;s ok, because it&#x27;s a tweezer.</li>
    <li> I love tweezerman, but find this style has to be pinched very hard in order to grab the hair. I prefer the traditional cut tweezean tweezers personally.</li>
    <li> Do you now that tweezers are a very personal and necessary grooming item to purchase and yet very little attention are paid to the dynamics of its structure! But these right here are great, nice grip wonderful tension on the press and  nice angled slant!</li>
    <li> this one doesnt work so well, it requires a firmer pinch to use.  it tends to grab on the very tip and without a firm pinch it wont pick up stuff on the inside edge.  i wish i got the other style from tweezerman as ive never had an issue with them.  i wont be getting this style again.</li>
    <li> I recently tried different brands of tweezers; I have come to the conclusion that for me Tweezerman has the best performance tweezers. I also recently purchased the Tweezerman Stainless Steel Pointed Slant Tweezers to give it a try, I was excited at first because it pulled out the finest hairs on my face, I have use them every day since I purchased them, the performance of the tweezers diminished over time, they still work, but not as good as when I first bought them. I have to pull multiple times to get the hairs; they tend to slip from the tweezers. They are still better than, other brands</li>
    <li> They might as well have been the pointed ones which I already have.  The slant is too oblique for me; I can barely catch anything.  I just got back from buying a pair (same brand) that I could inspect before purchasing; less slant and work well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these over the years. Best tweezers in the world.  Except for the last ones I got -- just as somebody else said, these only met at the tip, not down the rest of the slant.  Cheap tweezers from the drug store would have been as good.  I returned them, but had to remind the seller to refund my money, since it hadn&#x27;t appeared after a few weeks.  Not a happy experience.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these tweezers - they have exceeded my expectations.  I wanted them to remove very short coarse chin hairs and they do a great job.</li>
    <li> I rated this Tweezer 5 stars because it is extremly accurate, sharp when I need it to be at the tip, easy to use, comes with a plastic cover to protect the tip of the tweezer - overall a great product. Nothing bad to say about it it other than I wish it came in different colors! Buy it and you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased Tweezerman tweezers before spending about the same amount and received a superior product.  Tweezerman has really gone down in quality - extremely rough metal - which is very irritating to my skin.  Am now looking for an alternative higher-quality brand.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve bought several pairs of Tweezerman tweezers now, in different styles, and the only one we&#x27;ve needed to replace was because it was stepped on.  These are great tweezers that provide great quality and durability.  We&#x27;ll never buy another brand.</li>
    <li> Have played around with cheap tweezers for years that only half work.  THESE are good[[ASIN:B000782SQY Tweezerman Stainless Steel Point Tweezer in Assorted Colors]]Went back and bought a second pair.</li>
    <li> Works great and now I go to salon less for waxing. Gave one to my daughter so she will wont take them !</li>
