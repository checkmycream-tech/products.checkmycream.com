      <li>but it sure did for me</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love that it has the retinol and vitamin c.</li>

      <li>and I would have given this a better review</li>
      <li>I love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>

      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>It smells nice, goes on very easily and disappears quickly.</li>
      <li>Your skin not only feels good but looks good too.</li>
      <li>I have oily acne-prone skin with a fair share of spots/acne marks, so any help with toning/fading my skin has been greatly appreciated.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, I love it and have recommended to several of my friends.</li>
      <li>I stopped using it for a while as it seemed to cause eye irritation and the fragence was too strong.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t start having this problem until I had my babies; people used to tell me what nice skin I had before I went through my first pregnancy.</li>
      <li>I have noticed a huge difference in my acne scars since I started using this.</li>
      <li>I am contemplating seeing a dermatologist but I am happy with the overall results.</li>
      <li>&gt;* Has a light alluring scent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This neutrogena cream is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I also like the light scent of the serum.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy when I found this serum because out of all the products that I&#x27;ve used for tone correcting this is the only one that worked for me.</li>
      <li>I love my kids, but I want my beautiful clear skin back!    </li>
      <li>So far I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I have not found the special serum added into products.</li>
      <li>i waited a full week</li>
      <li>It did help smooth but it wasn&#x27;t useful in getting rid of my acne.  </li>
      <li>I love it so far &amp; love the price ;)</li>
      <li>will most definitely continue to use this product and will purchase more once I run out.  </li>
      <li>but overall I have pretty good skin.</li>
      <li>I know it works because I actually stare at myself in the car mirror, loving my skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is more even toned, and when I apply it to my face, it just feels so soft.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the investment.</li>
      <li>and I do not notice any difference in the color of two very large, sea horse shaped, brown spots on my cheeks.  </li>
      <li>organic is much better for my skin - I have seen improvement in my skin since switching to organic products in general</li>
      <li>It makes me look older, and makes my face look less attractive.</li>
      <li>but i think most people expect fast results...which the product clearly isn&#x27;t for</li>
      <li>but once those results started i was showing more more improvement everyday I</li>
      <li>When I first started to use it , it seemed to work for a while as it sloughed off skin.</li>
      <li>it Meant all my expectations it did exactly what I wanted it to do</li>
      <li>My overall skin complexion has improved and is much more radiant.</li>
      <li>I definitely plan to buy more once I run out.</li>
      <li>Amazon is the only place I was able to order this exact item.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been as consistent in applying before bed as I would like,</li>
      <li>I am typically quite happy with Neutrogena, so I was surprised.</li>
      <li>It is not clear and silky, but more lotion-like.</li>
      <li>Overall, it gets my vote; and that&#x27;s not common :)</li>
      <li>(it actually says you need to use it for at least 3-4 weeks to see some difference)...to be honest, do you want to put something that&#x27;s too strong on your face?!</li>
      <li>Unless you use this religiously it probably won&#x27;t make a huge difference but doesn&#x27;t irritate akin</li>
      <li>This has worked better than I expected.</li>
      <li>The smell is very fresh-my dog likes it too.</li>
      <li>In just a couple weeks, my skin tone looks so much brighter and even.  </li>
      <li>and i had to do something fast</li>
      <li>* Fades spots/tones really well.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>The sun spots have really diminished.</li>
      <li>I have been using this a few weeks now and to be honest, I seen no difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
      <li>It was mainly the texture that turned me off.</li>
      <li>I had my hopes SO high</li>
      <li>All high end products do not compare.....</li>
      <li>It may still be too early; the tube is not gone yet.</li>
      <li>* Leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and i had to prick and press and pinch it until it&#x27;s completely cleared up...</li>
      <li>Still not through the tube yet, but so far it&#x27;s a winner for tone correction.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for some improvement, but none so far.</li>
      <li>the next morning could not believe how much the inflammation had subsided.  </li>
      <li>It make the skin feels soft andcloses  </li>
      <li>I bought this the other day looking for something to smooth out my undereye circles and maybe fight the wrinkles before they  appear (I&#x27;m only 19)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone wanting smoother toned facial skin to add this your beauty regimen.  </li>
      <li>It took a considerate amount of time before I truly began to enjoy the results, but it states it takes approximately 12 weeks to really see results.</li>
      <li>I turn red from just about anything as my skin is very sensitive, and this never bothered me at all.</li>
      <li>i actually took a before picture and, even though there is still a slightly pink mark compared to the rest of my complexion (asian, but very fair-skinned), it&#x27;s still a far cry from what it used to be before...    </li>
      <li>now the spot is turning pink and slowly (but surely) fading...</li>
      <li>I went through the whole tube and there has not been the slightest change to my dark spots.</li>
      <li>but a very unsightly and dark spot remained (about 1/4 of an inch in diameter) on my left cheek, where it used to be...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Unless you use this religiously it probably won&#x27;t make a huge difference but doesn&#x27;t irritate akin so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> I have my share of spots and acne scars, and am on the lookout for a little help in fading those. I&#x27;ve tried pricier products, and the only thing that faded from those was my cash flow. This isn&#x27;t bad, in the $20 range, and using it for a couple of weeks, I already see a bit of fading and more even skin tone. I&#x27;m very happy with the product, and also like the texture (not too greasy, but just like a nice moisturizer) and that it&#x27;s not really scented. I look forward to seeing how my skin looks in two, four, six weeks down the road. I definitely plan to buy more once I run out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Philosophy&#x27;s Help Me.  The serum is somewhat thick and my face felt like it had a coating on it.  Also the fragrance isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it does diminish once you apply to product to your face.  It did help smooth but it wasn&#x27;t useful in getting rid of my acne.  I ended up returning the product to CVS.  I will be sticking with Help Me.</li>
    <li> I happened across a TV commercial for this serum, and from that, thought I&#x27;d give the serum a try.  I have oily acne-prone skin with a fair share of spots/acne marks, so any help with toning/fading my skin has been greatly appreciated.  I absolutely love this serum!  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 weeks now, and I have noticed that my facial spots have started to fade.  My skin is more even toned, and when I apply it to my face, it just feels so soft.  I also like the light scent of the serum.  It smells great.  In a nutshell, this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Fades spots/tones really well.  I started noticing a difference after about two weeks&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t bleach/discolor clothes/towels.  In the past, some of the facial products I used for acne would bleach/discolor my towels and clothes.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem with the serum.  Your clothes/towels are safe.&lt;br /&gt;* Leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;* Has a light alluring scent.&lt;br /&gt;* Works well applying before bed (and even applying in the morning).  I haven&#x27;t been as consistent in applying before bed as I would like, so when I miss bedtime applications, I apply after washing my face in the morning.  It works great as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most definitely continue to use this product and will purchase more once I run out.  I highly recommend it to anyone wanting smoother toned facial skin to add this your beauty regimen.  It&#x27;s well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> i never get spots or scars after squeezing pimples, but a couple of weeks ago, a zit just refused to go away and i had to prick and press and pinch it until it&#x27;s completely cleared up...but a very unsightly and dark spot remained (about 1/4 of an inch in diameter) on my left cheek, where it used to be...i waited a full week but there was no sign of it getting lighter...i came on amazon.com and searched for a spot treatment gel...granted, i was really skeptical...but i gave it two weeks...now the spot is turning pink and slowly (but surely) fading...i actually took a before picture and, even though there is still a slightly pink mark compared to the rest of my complexion (asian, but very fair-skinned), it&#x27;s still a far cry from what it used to be before...    i think it works for some, but not for others (duh)...but i think most people expect fast results...which the product clearly isn&#x27;t for (it actually says you need to use it for at least 3-4 weeks to see some difference)...to be honest, do you want to put something that&#x27;s too strong on your face?!</li>
    <li> this product feels like putting wax on my face. also, when massaging it on my face, it comes off like dead skin.  do not like at all!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I love it and have recommended to several of my friends.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I went through the whole tube and there has not been the slightest change to my dark spots. I would not call it a serum. It is not clear and silky, but more lotion-like. It did not seem to sink in; I did not like the way it would slough, or roll off. I am typically quite happy with Neutrogena, so I was surprised. It was mainly the texture that turned me off. Cannot bear to have a product roll off in &#x27;noodles&#x27;, and I was using the slightest amount too.</li>
    <li> I bought this the other day looking for something to smooth out my undereye circles and maybe fight the wrinkles before they  appear (I&#x27;m only 19) anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this every night for about a week now, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my makeup looks alot smoother when I put in on in the mornings..I have also noticed a brighter change in my complexion. I love the way this makes my skin feel. It makes it completely soft and feels as if it sinks into my skin. So far I love this stuff! The smell is very fresh-my dog likes it too. The product does seem more like a lotion though than a serum. I love that it has the retinol and vitamin c.I will probably keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> When I first started to use it , it seemed to work for a while as it sloughed off skin. However, it caused my eyes to get red and itchy even though I tried to keep it away from my eyes. I stopped using it for a while as it seemed to cause eye irritation and the fragence was too strong. I resumed using it about a month later and it still made my eyes red and itchy and caused my skin to get rough and scaley. Still have some left in tube but I will throw it away.Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with dark spots around my bikini line from epilation and waxing and it seemed to take forever for the dark spots to go away! Summer is coming and i had to do something fast so the spots would be gone and i wouldn&#x27;t have to be embarressed about them. I bought this stuff yesterday and have used it 6 times since then and 75% of the spots darkness has already diminished! I have tried everything and this product is the best! Hope others will have the same luck!</li>
    <li> Burn when I applied it. My skin under eye would be red. I used to buy it all the time at CVS and that never happened.  Must not be the same product.</li>
    <li> also does not guarantee - no animal testing - I have switched to organics and verify with companies absolutely no animal testing - by the way organic is much better for my skin - I have seen improvement in my skin since switching to organic products in general</li>
    <li> I have began to see results. The skin tone has began to gradually improve. I shall wait for a couple more weeks to see better results.</li>
    <li> I have red, blotchy skin. It makes me look older, and makes my face look less attractive. I didn&#x27;t start having this problem until I had my babies; people used to tell me what nice skin I had before I went through my first pregnancy. I love my kids, but I want my beautiful clear skin back!    I actually panic when the store runs out of this stuff (and they do). I found it at CVS the other day on sale for $9 and stocked up.     The Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Tone Correcting Concentrated Serum works wonders on my face. It takes about two weeks to see the big difference if I&#x27;ve run out or gotten out of the habit of applying it. I know it works because I actually stare at myself in the car mirror, loving my skin. If I forget to apply it for a few weeks (vacations, or I run out or something) I definitely notice my blotches coming back.     This is a tone correcting serum. Maybe their product information says it takes away dark spots or birthmarks or scarring, but I am not using it for that. I am using it to even out my skin tone and make my skin brighter (it looks younger) and for that it definitely works, for me.     I have no idea what people are talking about with the smell or with the \\&quot;sloughing\\&quot;. Perhaps they are allergic or are buying stale product or have really sensitive skin. I turn red from just about anything as my skin is very sensitive, and this never bothered me at all. And the smell is no different from any facial cream, which is what this feels like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a skin correcting product before. I was hoping for some improvement, but none so far. It may still be too early; the tube is not gone yet. It smells nice, goes on very easily and disappears quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have noticed a huge difference in my acne scars since I started using this. I would 100% recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of products to even out my skin tone, and this has, by far, been the best.  In just a couple weeks, my skin tone looks so much brighter and even.  The sun spots have really diminished. Love it!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and most of them were good saying people saw results in 2 weeks.  I have been using this stuff religiously day and night for 3 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t noticed ANY difference whatsoever.  I&#x27;m using to help even out skin tone because of my acne scars.  I had my hopes SO high and I would have given this a better review obviously if I&#x27;d noticed some difference but there&#x27;s none.  I didn&#x27;t even give it 2 stars because it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> The serum feels nice and did not irritate my skin but it also did not fade anything.  I have been using the serum for about a month day and night and I do not notice any difference in the color of two very large, sea horse shaped, brown spots on my cheeks.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically to help improve the tone of my skin.  I have been using it for over 2 weeks and have not noticed a difference.  Its a nice moisturizer but for the price I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This product is literally amazing. At first I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t think it would work for african American skin tones but fortunately I was wrong. It took a considerate amount of time before I truly began to enjoy the results, but it states it takes approximately 12 weeks to really see results. Overall, it gets my vote; and that&#x27;s not common :)</li>
    <li> I needed something to help with pretty bad scarring .I am allergic to spf that is added into products. Neutrogena makes the only spf that I am not allergic to unfortunately I have not found the special serum added into products. so this is perfect for me</li>
    <li> I am African American and I have some acne scaring on my chin and neck but overall I have pretty good skin. After three days of using this product I noticed that my skin was brighter, clearer, smoother and younger looking. I...kid...you...not! Within a week my skin was brighter smoother more radiant....Within two weeks I began to notice that my acne scars were fading....and my chin and neck were beginning to look brighter. Now I&#x27;ve had these scars for a long time, Im not sure that this product will totally eliminate my dark marks...I am contemplating seeing a dermatologist but I am happy with the overall results. Even with the minimal fading that I am seeing in my dark marks...My overall skin complexion has improved and is much more radiant. This product may not be for everyone but it works for me!</li>
    <li> I had hyper pigmentation on my cheeks and this worked like a charm. Took a few weeks to see the results and started getting lots of compliments on how young I looked.  Also stopped wearing concealer/foundation. I do find that I have to regularly use it and it keeps the discolouration at minimum. Be sure to use sunscreen during the day!</li>
    <li> This has worked better than I expected. Still not through the tube yet, but so far it&#x27;s a winner for tone correction.</li>
    <li> It was advertised as having slightly damaged packaging and it was very slight!! The contents were untouched.  The product itself is not a miracle cure but does even facial toning when used daily.  There are other products that work faster but are way too epensive.  This is a good price for a good product.</li>
    <li> I love this product  it Meant all my expectations it did exactly what I wanted it to do it cleared my face I started seeing results in about three to four weeks but once those results started i was showing more more improvement everyday I&lt;br /&gt;love it I love it I love it</li>
    <li> This neutrogena cream is fantastic. It make the skin feels soft andcloses  the pores on your face. Your skin not only feels good but looks good too. I recommend this cream for anyone.</li>
    <li> I had been experiencing acne on both sides of my neck and was having no success.  I happened to discover this in my trove of skin creams which I probably bought and forgot about.  Anyway in desperation I applied it and the next morning could not believe how much the inflammation had subsided.  I continued using it and within  4 days my neck is smoooooth.  I have since recommended it to two of my clients who have acne and ruddy skin, because my skin also looks less red.  I decided to check this serum on amazon to see what it costs and if there were any reviews. When I saw &#x27;58&#x27; reviews thought to make it 59 with my favorable review.  It may not work for everybody but it sure did for me and I hope it does for the two clients I recommend it to.</li>
    <li> I had been unable to locate this item in the stores and it doesn&#x27;t help when companies keep changing the packaging to get you to buy more stuff. I really like this product its not too harsh on my skin and it repairs and renews damaged skin making it smoother without over drying. The shipment came on time and was packaged neatly. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I found this serum because out of all the products that I&#x27;ve used for tone correcting this is the only one that worked for me. I&#x27;m so disappointed that they have stopped making it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this a few weeks now and to be honest, I seen no difference in my skin. None at all. I would not buy again. I used it to lighten brown, aging spots and it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> My face is amazing because of this product.  Amazon is the only place I was able to order this exact item.  All high end products do not compare.....dermologica, clinique &amp; loreal over priced and over rated.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it never cease to amaze me. The results are amazing! I get compliments on my skin tone all the time. I&#x27;m 50 now and my skin looks GREAT!</li>
    <li> Looked up Allure voted best product&#x27;s this was on top of list for night eye creams. I love it so far &amp; love the price ;)</li>
