    <li> The shampoo works great but the conditioner isn&#x27;t the real thing, it doesn&#x27;t soften my hair, it makes it hard and dry. I am very disappointed .</li>
    <li> Love It! I&#x27;ve been using this duo since I got this. My hair is softer, shiner, and overall healthier.. Did receive this fast no problems..&lt;br /&gt;Will be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :)</li>
    <li> my favorite shampoo! leaves my hair feeling great!</li>
    <li> Great product to recover your damaged hair... And lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> The fiberstrong products have done wonders for my hair. I bought this stuff from my hairstylist a year ago to strengthen my hair. When my hair gets a certain med-long length, it starts to knot up &amp; break after a shower becoming very unhealthy. From a year ago, I used up my product in June, so I have been w/o, until 2 wks ago. I haven&#x27;t even cut my hair for 1 yr. I&#x27;d say I have been able to grow my hair an addt&#x27;l 6 inches more than I ever have before. A couple more inches and my hair will touch the butt. Having not used these products in 6 mths, my long hair has started to knot up again. After a couple of weeks of using product, I have noticed a significant decrease in knots. As recommended, I use the Intra-Cylane fortifying cream as well. Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Love having this delivered to my door.  No more running errands on my lunch hour to find it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo &amp; conditioner if you have weak fragile hair. I was loosing a lot of hair due to breakage. You will noticed a big improvement from the very first wash and will keep improving over time. You only have to use a small amount so these bottles will last you a very long time even if you have long hair like I do. This is a great deal, I paid twice as much for half the size at a salon. I use to like to try different products but I&#x27;m staying with these products especially since I color my hair often so it&#x27;s safe to use for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. My hair dresser uses it so I tried it. Had to get the bigger bottles.  All the girls in the house use it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and I have had less breakage since using the product. My hairs is also silky and shiny and looks a bit thicker. The shampoo really suds up and will last a very long time. I have long hair and will get about 2-3 months out of the conditioner. My husband even used it on his beard which looks softer and shinier. It wa twice as much at my local stores.</li>
    <li> Great product for fine thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I was using the matrix color last and I liked it. ..but lately I noticed it wasn&#x27;t making my hair as soft as it used to granted I dye my hair a lot especially lately cause I&#x27;ve been looking for the right hair color. ..anyways I decided to try the advanced fiberstrong and I really like it. ..I can totally notice the difference in my hair. ..especially after I style it. ..it looks and feels healthy. ..considering I do so much to it.</li>
    <li> I always use biolage and decided to try this new fiberstrong line. It smells amazing and made my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> This product was referred to me me by my stylist.  Smells great and the conditioner is very lightweight.  After a week of use I started noticing stronger hair.</li>
    <li> That&#x60;s probably the best Shampoo/Conditioner i&#x27;ve ever purchased! The smell is great and after a few times of using it i noticed that my hair is in a better condition than it was before. So i will stick with it, even if it is a bit more pricey... but hey it is worth!!! I highly recommend it to people with fine/thin hair. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this set!!! This helps my hair so much its softer smoother shinier healthier stronger and less fly always. I have fine blonde hair and this is the best to keep my hair healthy and strong. I am getting the fortifying cream today so excited to use that as well.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my hair though. It&#x27;s only been 1 1/2 week</li>
    <li> Not the best shampoo/ conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t see a difference after using this shampoo:/</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people with damaged hair. My daughter has been using for a couple of months and her hair is thick and healthy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Biolage for several years, and have been waiting for this specific product to be available in the US. I have thin, fine, blonde hair that is prone to breakage. After only a week of using this product, I can really see a difference in strength.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and curly</li>
    <li> If you have never used a Biolage product, I highly recommend you try it!  I used to think all shampoos were just that--shampoos, but I had a friend let me try this product.  It literally changed the way my hair felt and looked.  I also use the Maxtrix Biolage Deep Smoothing Serum and Hydra-seal Leave-in Cr&amp;egrave;me, but it&#x27;s really a product worth the extra money!&lt;br /&gt;I personally love the bamboo and fiberstrong lines that Matrix has released, but I can&#x27;t find the bamboo one anymore.  The Orchid line; however, has something in it that I&#x27;m allergic to.  It makes my head itch intensely when I used it.  Of course, this is just with me.  I have other friends that love the Orchid line and it works well with them.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see a change in your hair (shine, flow, not dull), I really recommend trying one of the Matrix Biolage lines (find which is right for you)!</li>
    <li> Love!!! Love!!!! Love!!!! Great hair products and good price for the big bottles!</li>
    <li> i love this shampoo and conditioner , i have dirty blonde hair and my ends get alot of sun , and damage from highlights , and this really makes my hair look and feel great ! great smell too !!</li>
    <li> Love this set! My hair smells great and its super soft! I love Biology products anyways but I think this is my favorite one! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My hair got really dry and started falling out a lot.</li>
    <li> Arrived quicker than I thought!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set after it was recommended to me by a natural hairstylist. I am currently transitioning from relaxed hair to natural hair and she said that this product helps to protect the line of demarcation. I have been using it for a few months now &amp; I am very pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> okay - feels a bit heavy on the hair</li>
    <li> Wife bought it using my account. Must be good cause I always see it in the shower. Now please stop asking me to review this</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> My beautician recommended this and I LOVE IT! It made my hair feel very silky the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and has a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> This shampoo lathers nicely and left my hair feeling quite soft.  I only use a dot of the conditioner, as a little seems to go a long way.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so it is too soon to know whether or not my hair is getting stronger, but so far I like the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I do like the shampoo never recieved the conditioner so kind of tough to say weather I like it or not.[[ASIN:B00E9DTE3S Matrix Advanced Fiberstrong Shampoo &amp; Conditioner Liter Duo, 33.8 oz each.]]</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel so good and my hair falls out less each time I wash it</li>
    <li> In just a washed my hair is healthier!!&lt;br /&gt;Smelling very well.</li>
    <li> Just received these in the mail and immediately ran to the shower to try them out. They are thick and made me feel like I was at the salon in my own shower. My hair feels silkier and healthier with just one use. The smell is awesome! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product! have been buying for a while now!!</li>
