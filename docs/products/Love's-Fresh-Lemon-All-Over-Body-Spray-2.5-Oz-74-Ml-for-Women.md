      <li>i was thrilled to see love&#x27;s lemon after so many years.</li>
      <li>LOVE the scent.  </li>
      <li>Smells good and is lemony but the scent disappears very soon after you spray on.  </li>
      <li>and it brought back great memories.</li>
      <li>I wish they sold the Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon Bath Oil.</li>
      <li>LOVE THE LIGHT, FRESH, LEMONY SCENT...</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t exactly as lemony I remember, but it still is a nice, light, fresh fragrance.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite scents when I was younger... and still refreshing and light!</li>
      <li>But it quickly disappears and there is no lingering smell on your skin.  </li>
      <li>Just like the Love&#x27;s Lemon from high school in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Who wants a mouth full of perfume if they kiss your neck?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably end up trying some of the recommendations other reviewers have made just to see if I can find something more reminiscent of the original Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon.</li>
      <li>Packaged well, and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price, but I&#x27;m still glad a bought it.  </li>
      <li>highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Evey time I push the top, it oozes out every where.</li>
      <li>Brings back memories, first cologne I wore as a teeny-popper.....</li>
      <li>A huge waste of money...  </li>
      <li>this was my favorite from my younger days, but his version is almost imperceptible....</li>
      <li>Great for a fresh immediate scent that smells just SLIGHTLY afterwards, which may not be a bad thing.  </li>

<li> it doesn&#x27;t last long, so take it with you for another spritz during the day.</li>
<li> However after a long Google search I ended up at Amazon where I do almost all my  shopping now.</li>
<li> These bottles came timely and were fresh, and nothing was broken (like the spray nozzles which used to occur when I bought this elsewhere.</li>
<li> As other people have commented, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
<li> There is absolutely no smell to this.  </li>
<li> THE NEXT FEW DAYS</li>
<li> i wear it every day, either alone or with other fragrances.</li>
<li> they need to punch it up a little</li>
<li> When you first apply it, you get a very faint smell of the spray I remember from years ago.  </li>
<li> it is no longer any any of the usual suspects&#x27; sites, like Dana or Fragrence.</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>
<li> Too bad I don&#x27;t wear coats anymore, or I would try that!  </li>
<li> I am very disappointed and would not order this again.</li>

    <li> Smells good and is lemony but the scent disappears very soon after you spray on.  Would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as I remembered from over 20 years ago in the 70&#x27;s. I wish they sold the Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon Bath Oil. It&#x27;s light and wonderful.</li>
    <li> i was thrilled to see love&#x27;s lemon after so many years. as others have said, it&#x27;s just as wonderful as it was 4 decades ago. i wear it every day, either alone or with other fragrances. it doesn&#x27;t last long, so take it with you for another spritz during the day. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not as lemony as I remember it to be.</li>
    <li> A vague resemblance to the Love Lemon of the 70&#x27;s.  Spray mechanism broke the 2nd time I sued it. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t exactly as lemony I remember, but it still is a nice, light, fresh fragrance.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price, but I&#x27;m still glad a bought it.

    <li> it is no longer any any of the usual suspects&#x27; sites, like Dana or Fragrence. However after a long Google search I ended up at Amazon where I do almost all my  shopping now. These bottles came timely and were fresh, and nothing was broken (like the spray nozzles which used to occur when I bought this elsewhere. I am extremely happy</li>
    <li> LOVE the scent.  It does remind me of the 70s when I was a kid and would spray it all over my body in Zayre.  As other people have commented, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  But, it probably didn&#x27;t back then either, as they used to advertise spraying it all over and that is what I did then.  I do remember it always lingering on the fur of my winter coat though.  Too bad I don&#x27;t wear coats anymore, or I would try that!  Great for a fresh immediate scent that smells just SLIGHTLY afterwards, which may not be a bad thing.  Who wants a mouth full of perfume if they kiss your neck?</li>
    <li> this was my favorite from my younger days, but his version is almost imperceptible....they need to punch it up a little</li>
    <li> Just like we remembered!!!</li>
