      <li>I love this curling iron!  </li>
      <li>Perfect gift for the teen girl - daughter was thrilled, &amp; enjoys having the option to now straighten w/her straightener, or curl w/this.</li>
      <li>It was great for the first two months</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Each time I buy this product it seems to look better but works worse.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has became my favorite curling iron ever.</li>
      <li>love the heat settings on this, as well as the silicone sleeve.  </li>
      <li>love this curling iron.</li>
      <li>Love all the heat settings.</li>
      <li>but it is nice to store it in to keep the iron clean in the cabinet.  </li>
      <li>I have been happy with my decision so far.  </li>
      <li>Pros: it heats up very fast and produces nice curls.</li>
      <li>, the light comes on but no heat whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>Works great with even short hair.</li>
      <li>I have short hair, so this &amp;#34;one inch&amp;#34; gives me great curl and height.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not only is the sleeve great for travel</li>
      <li>I have thick hair and this curls my hair perfectly every time with no effort</li>
      <li>The first one worked fine</li>
      <li>super affordable too</li>
      <li>Heats up fast, easy to handle, &amp; does what I want.  </li>
      <li>It is a well made curling iron that heats up fast and is easy to work with.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great curling iron for the price and a totally worth it for the person who curls their hair a few times a week, as I do.</li>
      <li>This arrived right on time &amp;</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t travel very much</li>
      <li>does the job very well !</li>
      <li>haha!  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve been using these since they first came out</li>
      <li>It is very simple and easy to use,not like some of the newer styled Irons that you have to have a manual to operate.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It broke really soon after getting it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really heat up</li>
      <li>Well, I guess I should have spent more anyway.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have a real use for the silicon sleeve</li>
      <li>I got this one to replace it, and use it mainly as a curling rod (I wrap my hair around it instead of clamping the hair in it).</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m always afraid of putting a warm iron in my bag), but it&#x27;s great for protecting my little ones!</li>
      <li>Cons: the temp &amp;#34;wheel&amp;#34; adjusts too easily - it tends to dial down to a lower heat while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
      <li>This one totally fits the bill, as it gives me nice, long lasting curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The little ball bead thing that keeps the handle from gliding smoothly jumped out of place.</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m almost 61 years old.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve senselessly purchased many of these same irons; they all stop working within a few weeks.  </li>
      <li>I like this curling iron very much, but be careful of flipping the heat knob.  </li>
      <li>It is right where your hand rests and turns the temp up and down as you rotate it around your hair.</li>

    <li> I needed a metal curling iron, as all of the coated metals never seem to give me any curl with staying power.  This one totally fits the bill, as it gives me nice, long lasting curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the heat settings on this, as well as the silicone sleeve.  That has been a life saver!  Not only is the sleeve great for travel (I&#x27;m always afraid of putting a warm iron in my bag), but it&#x27;s great for protecting my little ones! I don&#x27;t have to worry that they might grab it off the counter while it&#x27;s cooling.  I also appreciate the swivel cord, as it doesn&#x27;t get tangled while I&#x27;m wrapping my hair around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great curling iron for the price and a totally worth it for the person who curls their hair a few times a week, as I do.</li>
    <li> Quality product and came on time.</li>
    <li> Each time I buy this product it seems to look better but works worse.&lt;br /&gt;this is my last time buying it. The first one worked fine but the cord&lt;br /&gt;broke. This one the curler heat part sticks to the hair and the screw pulls out hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these now and they keep breaking! Works well.....until they don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really heat up</li>
    <li> love this curling iron. I have short hair, so this &amp;#34;one inch&amp;#34; gives me great curl and height.&lt;br /&gt; It is very simple and easy to use,not like some of the newer styled Irons that you have to have a manual to operate.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job very well ! Love all the heat settings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve senselessly purchased many of these same irons; they all stop working within a few weeks.  The cord shorts out or like this time, the light comes on but no heat whatsoever.  Terrible that they haven&#x27;t changed this!</li>
    <li> I selected the Revlon CurlStay because of the price and the reviews.  I have been happy with my decision so far.  It is a well made curling iron that heats up fast and is easy to work with.  I don&#x27;t travel very much so I don&#x27;t have a real use for the silicon sleeve but it is nice to store it in to keep the iron clean in the cabinet.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a reliable &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; curling iron.</li>
    <li> I like this curling iron very much, but be careful of flipping the heat knob.  too low and it doesn&#x27;t curl (if your hairs thick) to high and it&#x27;s dangerous.  Figure out your number and be careful not to bump it durring curling.  :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t curl my hair a lot so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a curling iron. Well, I guess I should have spent more anyway. Pros: it heats up very fast and produces nice curls. Cons: the temp &amp;#34;wheel&amp;#34; adjusts too easily - it tends to dial down to a lower heat while I&#x27;m using it. But most annoyingly, the little spring in the clamp keeps busting, making it basically worthless. If I wanted a wand, I would have bought one of those. Save your money or at least put it towards a higher end model. This was a waste.</li>
    <li> Everything about this product is good except for the temperature control knob. It is right where your hand rests and turns the temp up and down as you rotate it around your hair. I started out on ten and suddenly I was 25! That can be dangerous!</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Revlon curling iron, but it was extremely old and finally broke after 10 years.I got this one to replace it, and use it mainly as a curling rod (I wrap my hair around it instead of clamping the hair in it). It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for the teen girl - daughter was thrilled, &amp; enjoys having the option to now straighten w/her straightener, or curl w/this.</li>
    <li> Heats well, but your hair gets caught in it. Thinking about trying to return it.</li>
    <li> This has became my favorite curling iron ever. I have thick hair and this curls my hair perfectly every time with no effort I love it! super affordable too which is a plus in my books</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great with even short hair.</li>
    <li> This arrived right on time &amp; well packaged...haha!  Hard to open, but this is the way it goes.  I love this curling iron!  Heats up fast, easy to handle, &amp; does what I want.  But I&#x27;ve been using these since they first came out &amp; I&#x27;m almost 61 years old.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> It was great for the first two months then the handle stopped working! Something came loose and it won&#x27;t close tightly all the way.</li>
    <li> It broke really soon after getting it. The little ball bead thing that keeps the handle from gliding smoothly jumped out of place. Now it sticks a lot. Me and my sister managed to fix it well enough that its still usable though.</li>
