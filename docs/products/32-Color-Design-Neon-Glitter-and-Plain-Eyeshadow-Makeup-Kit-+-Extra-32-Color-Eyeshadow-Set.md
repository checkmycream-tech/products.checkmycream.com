      <li>wish the palat was larger but it is beautiful on my skin</li>
      <li>Also the free gift I got with this was a all glitter pallet.</li>

      <li>The size of the shadow are fine for me because I don&#x27;t wear shadow everyday so this will last me awhile.  </li>
      <li>but the glitter is not really great to use by itself, I&#x27;ve noticed the glitter sits on top, once used the wax or gel is only left in the bottom.</li>

    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product but I really wish I would have read the reviews bc the others are right on point the sparkles shadow sucks!</li>
    <li> Love it and the colors are beautiful</li>
    <li> I love the product it comes just as stated and the glitter affect is out of sight very glamourus, I just wish there was a little more product there in each compartment color, but a must buy</li>
    <li> Allot of colors and it will last me along time. Excellent for the price you pay at least 10$ for 4 colors at the store so love it !!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  For the price it is worth it.  I lucked up an received an all glitter palette for a total of 96 shades.  The size of the shadow are fine for me because I don&#x27;t wear shadow everyday so this will last me awhile.  The colors are nice on my brown toned skin.  Using a primer or a powder shade underneath will help make the color of the glitter pop.  The grey shadow did break up during shipping but I sprinkled the pieces in my hand and pressed them back into its spot.  You really can&#x27;t beat it for the price..  Stir the glitter into the gel to avoid just having del left over.</li>
