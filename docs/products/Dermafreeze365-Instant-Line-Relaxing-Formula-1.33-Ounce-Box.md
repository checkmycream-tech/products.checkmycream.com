      <li>Too good to be true.  </li>
      <li>it may have some benefits but it isn&#x27;t a miracle cream (which is what I am always hoping for!!!) :-)  </li>
      <li>Safer than Botox:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a temporary thing, but I continued to use this in the morning and in the evening before bed.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the results.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is true or they just want to make me feel nice</li>
      <li>product, but not the best one for people with dry skin</li>
      <li>Received the product very quickly and packaged well, however when opening the jar it was not a cream or lotion texture</li>
      <li>The texture is &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; but, nevermind that, it feels smooth once rubbed into the skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;freeze&amp;#34; products before that temporarily tighten the skin over lines and wrinkles giving them a smooth appearance.  </li>
      <li>A real bummer because i liked this cream and thought it worked.  </li>
      <li>Only thing I use works great</li>
      <li>I have used this product three years helps tighten and smooth wrinkles around mouth and forehead.</li>
      <li>It seems to work OK on the forehead and laugh lines, but does nothing under the eyes.</li>
      <li>lasts 24 hours or so.. enjoy</li>
      <li>so it may be worth something to me!  </li>
      <li>Gave it a good try for several months; didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
      <li>She has tried many face products and really says this one works.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff works very well and quick shipping as well</li>
      <li>I strongly suspect that like so many beauty products in the market today, it had no active ingredient.</li>
      <li>This product really works!!</li>
      <li>it did indeed shrink my morning bags the first time I used it!</li>
      <li>Although all of my fine lines were not &amp;#34;erased&amp;#34; (and really that would take a miracle)</li>
      <li>my sagging morning eyes appeared fresh and the bags were flattened/retracted.</li>
      <li>When I opened the lid, something didn&#x27;t look quite right...</li>
      <li>Can tell right away.</li>
      <li>this product helps me to look pretty good even after a rough night of sleep.</li>
      <li>you dont need any particular brand, just make sure its decent quality</li>
      <li>I was a bit skeptical, but i must say im impressed!</li>
      <li>Not only it did not get rid of wrinkles, it added more by drying my skin.</li>
      <li>I was sold with My first jar.  </li>
      <li>This makes me look more awake and younger.  </li>
      <li>but it works better than any product i&#x27;ve tried or bought for double and even triple this price.</li>
      <li>It did exactly what it says on the packaging.</li>
      <li>Most people think I am 15 years younger than I am.  </li>
      <li>Really makes a difference!</li>
      <li>I actually got it at a better price, and I can recommend this product to others as part of a skin care regimen.</li>
      <li>I really liked the way it felt (I live in a dry climate).  </li>
      <li>, I can certainly tell the difference when I don&#x27;t use it...</li>
      <li>I will be sure to buy new stock from my local drug store from now on.</li>
      <li>This product does absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>Did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>From looking at the seemingly polarized reviews it would appear that this product will either really work for you or it won&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
      <li>so you dontmake expression as much.  </li>
      <li>Nothing really</li>
      <li>My skin is pretty dry, and though this product definitely closed up the lines on my forehead, it left my skin kind of itchy--which most lotions for oily skin will do to me.</li>
      <li>The first year after 3 months I noticed the frown lines between my eyebrows were less prominent.</li>
      <li>I am new to this product and i have only used it twice, so I am no expert,  but application was easy it worked.</li>
      <li>I am going to request an exchange as I would still like to try this product, so I can add a true review of the actual item (Not how I received mine).</li>
      <li>It is probably the only skin care product that I have used up relatively quick (I use day and night).  </li>
      <li>Ive been using dermafreeze for several years and it makes a tremendous difference.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I saw absolutely no evidence that this product does anything to improve the apprearance of fine lines or expression marks on the skin.  </li>
      <li>When I stop using the product my skin becomes very wrinkled and old looking.</li>
      <li>it was more like a dried out sponge.</li>
      <li>I felt instant tightening and firming on my laugh lines and forehead.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I read the other reviews before purchasing</li>
      <li>I first came across dermafreeze at a local pharmacy.  </li>
      <li>if you use it in the a.m. and the p.m., I feel the results are pretty lasting.  </li>
      <li>I have used this face lotion for a few years, and was happy to find it on Amazon for 10 dollars less than my local drug store.    </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 53 and look young for my age except for my eyes.</li>
      <li>but much to my surprise before I left the house</li>
      <li>Within minutes, I felt my skin tightening and my fine lines became less apparent.</li>
      <li>My face feels stiff when I first apply it, but I don&#x27;t think it has made that much difference.</li>
      <li>Its smart to carry with you, since the effects only last around 6 hours.</li>
      <li>sure enough, it was hard as a rock when I went to use it.    </li>
      <li>I am 60 years old and people say I look much younger like in the 40 s.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok, not great.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, my boyfriend who has normal skin, did not have this problem and he absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Having very dry skin, I use this sparingly on a few points on my face.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the lotion being rather hard, that was true for me too in a couple of the jars, but not like a rock.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was a waste of money! Gave it a good try for several months; didn&#x27;t do a thing. I strongly suspect that like so many beauty products in the market today, it had no active ingredient.</li>
    <li> Still on the fence about this product.  Hard to use.  Fortunately I read the other reviews before purchasing so I knew not to use on a totally dry face.  I&#x27;m not sure if I actually see any difference or not.  My face feels stiff when I first apply it, but I don&#x27;t think it has made that much difference.</li>
    <li> Really makes a difference! Can tell right away.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a discount retail store to try.  I really liked the way it felt (I live in a dry climate).  I especially liked the comments I received about \\&quot;How old are you?\\&quot; (I&#x27;m 52, guesses came in low 40&#x27;s).  It is probably the only skin care product that I have used up relatively quick (I use day and night).  As I got closer to the bottom of the jar, I started looking for it - and it was no longer at the discount store.  I&#x27;m glad I found it online, I can certainly tell the difference when I don&#x27;t use it...</li>
    <li> Not seeing a lot of difference, yet.</li>
    <li> A real bummer because i liked this cream and thought it worked.  Too good to be true.  There was a recall on this product and if you have any of these products...throw them out!!  Read link:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I have used this face lotion for a few years, and was happy to find it on Amazon for 10 dollars less than my local drug store.    When I opened the lid, something didn&#x27;t look quite right...sure enough, it was hard as a rock when I went to use it.    I think when the jars sit in the warehouse too long, the product loses some of it&#x27;s moisture content, thus increasing viscosity, making it difficult, if not impossible to use.    I will be sure to buy new stock from my local drug store from now on.</li>
    <li> Although all of my fine lines were not &amp;#34;erased&amp;#34; (and really that would take a miracle) it did indeed shrink my morning bags the first time I used it! I am more than ellated. It is a bit drying but I can&#x27;t complain. I accidently rubbed the cream rather than dab it so I simply just used another small pump of the cream and tapped it around my eye. I waited until my first cup of coffee and checked for some results but didn&#x27;t see much change and became disappointed in having read the description as &amp;#34;immediate.&amp;#34; I continued my morning routine as usual feeling like I wasted more money on a junky product but much to my surprise before I left the house my sagging morning eyes appeared fresh and the bags were flattened/retracted. LOVE LOVE LOVE the results. The box says it will show results within 30 minutes and in my case it worked as advertised. it made such a difference I will take before and after photos with a 30 window to show results the next time I have a moment.</li>
    <li> I came across this at a Marshalls  store and purchased a few because of the ridiculously low price of $3. My skin is pretty dry, and though this product definitely closed up the lines on my forehead, it left my skin kind of itchy--which most lotions for oily skin will do to me. On the other hand, my boyfriend who has normal skin, did not have this problem and he absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Having very dry skin, I use this sparingly on a few points on my face.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the lotion being rather hard, that was true for me too in a couple of the jars, but not like a rock. That didnt bother me in the slightest, i just add a couple drops of water to soften it, it absorbs fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, but not the best one for people with dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you didnt like this product but like the idea of freezing your skin, just get GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) you dont need any particular brand, just make sure its decent quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on and off for approximately 4 years. When I stop using the product my skin becomes very wrinkled and old looking. As soon as I start back on DermaFreeze my skin looks healthy and my face has the appearance of looking relaxed. My friends notice the difference as well. From looking at the seemingly polarized reviews it would appear that this product will either really work for you or it won&#x27;t work at all.  I can say, for me, it works miracles on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 3 years and I love it. I have a forehead wrinkle that wears all my stress and this product helps me to look pretty good even after a rough night of sleep. I a great skin regimena nd this added to the arsenal has kept me looking fresh-faced!</li>
    <li> I follow the directions and use on a cleaned face.  The texture is &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; but, nevermind that, it feels smooth once rubbed into the skin. Leave on for 10 minutes before adding any moisturizer, sunblock or foundation.  I can feel and see the tightening effects.  Wrinkle lines seems to diminish. This makes me look more awake and younger.  I have not yet found a comparable product.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money. Not only it did not get rid of wrinkles, it added more by drying my skin. Horrible stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these, when I received them they were both dry and cracked through and through and I could not use either jar of it.  I have never been so disappointed in buying anything on line before, and the worst part was they wouldn&#x27;t do anything about it.  So I basically threw away 50.00 because I had express delivery done on this.  Whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy this product from these people!!</li>
    <li> makes me look years younger within minutes.  I have used this product for y ears and still get guessed 10 + years younger as a result....when I don&#x27;t use I can tell as can my friends/hubby...place product a little dab will do you and lay down holding face back to dry you can still use reg lotion after it dries.  lasts 24 hours or so.. enjoy</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. It takes 10 years off in minutes. You do have to watch using it with other moisturizers as it works best on its own.</li>
    <li> I use it over, under makeup it works Nice, u might not see instant results but after a week u will. then when u don&#x27;t. it helps</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell that this stuff does anything!  Oh well, keep on trying!  I knew it was just an experiment.</li>
    <li> Ive been using dermafreeze for several years and it makes a tremendous difference. I m 42 and often get compliments on how much younger than 42 I look and what do I do to make my skin look so taut. I think that says it all</li>
    <li> Received the product very quickly and packaged well, however when opening the jar it was not a cream or lotion texture it was more like a dried out sponge. It seemed as if it was not sealed properly possible. I am going to request an exchange as I would still like to try this product, so I can add a true review of the actual item (Not how I received mine).</li>
    <li> it may have some benefits but it isn&#x27;t a miracle cream (which is what I am always hoping for!!!) :-)  i have bought it more than once so it may be worth something to me!  it&#x27;s ok, not great.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing. I mean nothing. Tried it several times. In several spots. Over several days. NOTH-ING.</li>
    <li> I personally never used this product but my mom lives by it! She asked that I buy it for her for her Bday. She has tried many face products and really says this one works.</li>
    <li> I first came across dermafreeze at a local pharmacy.  I was sold with My first jar.  I would say it has softened the lines that were forming on my forehead.  I continue to use it, and was happy to find this item on amazon.com. I have already purchased it twice online. I actually got it at a better price, and I can recommend this product to others as part of a skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m use this product for  to two year, and never stop buy this product.  Is the best one.  I love it</li>
    <li> Only thing I use works great</li>
    <li> I do not have serious wrinkles so I thought it might work well. Did not work as well as it is advertised, was a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I too bought this product at Marshalls for about $3 to $4, I figured I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose.  I was so surprised and impressed when I first applied it and experienced the feeling of my skin tightening. I&#x27;m sure this is a temporary thing, but I continued to use this in the morning and in the evening before bed.  I didn&#x27;t continue to analyze my skin like I used to before using it but was satisfied with the results.  I then went through a long weekend without it and in the morning the other day I looked in the mirror after applying my makeup and was shocked when I noticed the fine lines that I used to agonize over were all back--I&#x27;m 48 so believe me I have plenty.  Now i swear by this.  I&#x27;ve read some reviews that say the effects are temporary and I do believe that; but if you use it in the a.m. and the p.m., I feel the results are pretty lasting.  That is why I am here to buy another jar so I am not without it again.</li>
    <li> The product is hard and waxy, not creamy as I had imagined.  It seems to work OK on the forehead and laugh lines, but does nothing under the eyes.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and I love it. No of course it doesn&#x27;t take the wrinkles away but it does what it says it freezes your face (I use on my forehead) so everything is &amp;#34;lifted&amp;#34; use it around my eye lids too to pull everything up. Safer than Botox:)</li>
    <li> I picked this up at marshalls today, and tried it out when i got home. I was a bit skeptical, but i must say im impressed! It did exactly what it says on the packaging. I felt instant tightening and firming on my laugh lines and forehead. Feels like an instant freeze tightening feeling. Im curious now to see the results after a week or 2 of usage..</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, and it is really amazing stuff. Great product and transaction.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a joke. Did not do anything... don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a cosmetic and hair store for about $27. This product really works!! Within minutes, I felt my skin tightening and my fine lines became less apparent. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week but it works better than any product i&#x27;ve tried or bought for double and even triple this price. I&#x27;m also going to purchase this product for my mom to try also. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> my daughter wanted and was glad to receive the gift, was here in good time.thanks for everything. and all these words arn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
    <li> Cannot tell it helps at all, maybe I am just not seeing it.</li>
    <li> Great product, I use it day and night with a moisturizer. I have used this product three years helps tighten and smooth wrinkles around mouth and forehead.</li>
    <li> Save your money! I am 42 with not a lot of deep lines, and this didn&#x27;t even help the small ones. I saw no change at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d didn&#x27;t do anything,I was very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I am new to this product and i have only used it twice, so I am no expert,  but application was easy it worked.</li>
    <li> I saw no improvements. Nothing really</li>
    <li> Am getting raves for my skin texture.</li>
    <li> I picked up this product at Burlington Coat Factory for about $5 USD. I have noticeable lines and wrinkles around my eyes that showed up perfectly in photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this today for a date. Within a few minutes my eye lines and under eye wrinkles were gone. Totally GONE! This stuff took years off my face. I used it above my upper lip and those lines disappeared.  Its smart to carry with you, since the effects only last around 6 hours. Still, I&#x27;m ecstatic. I&#x27;m 53 and look young for my age except for my eyes. With Dermafreeze my under eye tissue and crows feet disappeared and my eyes looked like they did at 35. No bags, sags or lines. Im stocking up on it!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews it sounds good to be true! But anyhow I ended up purchasing it. This cream goes on as a paste and when it dries it becomes flaky. I also purchased for the eyes, it does the same. I scrub my face, again try it twice, same results, small white flakes. The worse product ever. Waste my $:-(</li>
    <li> This definitely does not work.  I only ordered it mistakenly for a product I saw on TV.  This product does absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> this product had no instructions. I am glad I found some information on Amazon. I do not know whether you rinse it off or not. I would assume you don&#x27;t, but anyway it does make my skin feel real tight like a mask. I only paid $4 for it at Burlington so whether it works or not I did not spend a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I m afraid this product is a farce.  Does not do anything.  Dries out in a couple of weeks into a lump.  I ordered it after being recommended by Dr. Oz.  I have stopped believing in all the  products hyped by Oz.  It does not allow me to put in a minus star otherwise I would.</li>
    <li> This cream is perfect for under your eyes and forehead.  I always use this product before putting on my make-up, I am so glad I can get this product through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Most people think I am 15 years younger than I am.  Repeated use definitely slows the aging process. Immediate results can be felt upon application.  I use this product morning and night in crucial areas. (Forehead, around the eyes, around my mouth.)  Price is wonderful for the results.  Good alternative to botox.</li>
    <li> I saw absolutely no evidence that this product does anything to improve the apprearance of fine lines or expression marks on the skin.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not like its Botox but I think it helps.  Seems to plump the lines and tighten the area so you dontmake expression as much.  Think would Work great along with Botox. Will buy again.  Every little bit helps &amp; not crazy expensive!</li>
    <li> Have used the DermaFreeze for a few years now and it definitely hides wrinkles for hours at a time. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for at least 10 y ears. The first year after 3 months I noticed the frown lines between my eyebrows were less prominent. I am 60 years old and people say I look much younger like in the 40 s. I don&#x27;t know if this is true or they just want to make me feel nice but I am continuing to use this cream.</li>
    <li> Terrific. Can see and feel the difference within 15 minutes of application.</li>
    <li> Total waste if money.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff works very well and quick shipping as well</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using this for years!</li>
    <li> Did not do anything. A total waste!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;freeze&amp;#34; products before that temporarily tighten the skin over lines and wrinkles giving them a smooth appearance.  This product may work as a moisturizing cream, but it does NOT offer instant results as advertised.  I saw zero change in my skin.  I used it day and night as directed for three weeks.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and would not recommend DermaFreeze365.</li>
