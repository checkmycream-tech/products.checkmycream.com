### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is an excellent addition to conditioner.  </li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.  </li>
      <li>MY JESUS incredible.</li>
      <li>I HAD NOT HEARD OF THIS PRODUCT; I AM SO SO HAPPY I FOUND IT.  </li>
      <li>This stuff has been amazing!</li>
      <li>I thought this would be as good as baby face</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gives the hair good treatment</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great being able to use in the comfort of your own home and saves you from the the ridicules salon price for a hair treatment.</li>
      <li>I AM SO PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS...</li>
      <li>I am thoroughly satisfied with this product and it works well on ethnic hair if tere is someone wondering.</li>
      <li>So that you get a more potent mixture.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the result.</li>
      <li>Am totally pleased with how my hair responds.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite sweet, in a saccharine sort of way, and doesn&#x27;t play nicely with my conditioner&#x27;s fragrance (the scent of which I prefer).</li>
      <li>Will have to wait to determine if I&#x27;ll need to use it every time I wash my hair, but so far so good,</li>
      <li>So far so good - my hair is breaking</li>
      <li>WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
      <li>Overall good product though 😊</li>
      <li>/&gt;After much research, I decided on the Protein RX because I liked the ingredients, and it has certainly made a difference.</li>
      <li>I USED THIS PRODUCT JUST ONCE, AND THE VERY FIRST TIME I USED IT</li>
      <li>I had a perm two weeks ago, and it dried my hair severely, fly away, and felt wirey.</li>
      <li>makes your hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>MY HAIR WAS SO SOFT AND MANAGEABLE AND HEALTHY AFTER JUST ONE USE.  </li>
      <li>And after each treatment I&#x27;ve noted that my curls are actually softer, springier, and my hair is more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>WILL DEFINITELY ORDER MORE AND WILL RECOMMEND FAMILY AND FRIENDS</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t til the next day, for some reason, my hair felt more like how I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>works great but doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
      <li>and now it looks smooth, and feels soft..</li>
      <li>the Argan oil is super present in this product, You will feel its residue with just a little cap full in your conditioner, just make sure you mix something like 2 ounces of conditioner with the cap full at a time</li>
      <li>Fast shipping A++ .</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t really fiscally feasible for me to buy 2 or 3 of these a month at 15 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Then after washing my hair very well, I applied it and allowed it to sit on my hair with a plastic cap for about 45 mins.</li>
      <li>MY HAIR WAS REALLY DAMAGED.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;To test that it really was the Protein RX making the difference</li>
      <li>AND ANYONE WHO WANTS TO HELP THEIR HAIR TO BE REPAIRED FROM THE ROOT TO THE TIP.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s relatively neutral (i.e. not dry, not oily) and behaves, for the most part, but I&#x27;m in the process of growing my hair out.</li>
      <li>hair was very dry, so it was easy to notice the change</li>
      <li>and my hair went from dry and puffy to smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>I use high quality shampoos and conditioners, hair masks and leave in oil treatments.</li>
      <li>that pretty much covered my entire head.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They only reasons I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the strength could have been a little better in my hair..</li>
      <li>I wish i could put it directly onto my hair without adding conditioner</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve gone a couple treatments without using it and although my hair was moisturized, my curls weren&#x27;t as soft nor my hair as manageable.</li>
      <li>and I need something stronger though - didnt stop the breakage - but makes my hair soft</li>
      <li>My only real gripe with the product is the scent.</li>
      <li>The smell is like something from Heaven, my 5 yr old nephew thinks it smells like Bubblicious cotton candy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I then started spending lots of money on hair treatments at a different salon but had to stop because the price was just to much.</li>
      <li>Have used so far.  </li>
      <li>This little bottle is powerful stuff!</li>
      <li>Maybe it was the hot summer weather at delivery time, but this never worked as well as the other brand.</li>
      <li>I add a cap and a half full to my favourite deep conditioner, slather it on my damp hair, pull the shower cap on, do some housework, and then rinse it out.</li>
      <li>I am half Mexican and African American, with more of the Mexican type of hair.</li>
      <li>coarse 4b mostly 4c to 4z natural hair that is about or almost shoulder length</li>
      <li>maybe I will try just a little bit more than what the directions say next time and see other results.</li>
      <li>Also a little Desert Essence Coconut Soft Curl Hair Cream , with a splash of extra pure Hydrolized Wheat Pprotein and Quaternized Honey (Honeyquat).</li>

<li> That regimine includes adding a few supplements to my diet (i.e. collagen, biotin, and vitamin C), plus regular deep conditioning and protein</li>

<li> Also, not much comes in the bottle.</li>
<li> I have thick soft straw coils with some deep waves just past shoulder.</li>
<li> I have medium strand, medium to normal porosity, kinda thin to medium thickness,</li>
<li> This product didn&#x27;t weight down my hair.  </li>
<li> My hair is heavily processed.</li>
<li> only bad thing is that it is only a little over 1 ounce of product.</li>
<li> I must say the bottle is very small</li>
<li> They over processed my hair and my hair started breaking really bad.</li>
<li> My hair needed this so bad.</li>
<li> worst product ever</li>

    <li> The result is grassy.. No professional results. No shine.</li>
    <li> This little bottle is powerful stuff! I had immediate results. If your hair is dry with split ends and feels like straw....Protein Rx pulls the split ends together makes your hair soft and healthy looking. It really works!</li>
    <li> OMG! THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.  I HAD NOT HEARD OF THIS PRODUCT; I AM SO SO HAPPY I FOUND IT.  MY HAIR WAS REALLY DAMAGED.  I USED THIS PRODUCT JUST ONCE, AND THE VERY FIRST TIME I USED IT, IT WORKED.  MY HAIR WAS SO SOFT AND MANAGEABLE AND HEALTHY AFTER JUST ONE USE.  I AM SO PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS...WILL DEFINITELY ORDER MORE AND WILL RECOMMEND FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND ANYONE WHO WANTS TO HELP THEIR HAIR TO BE REPAIRED FROM THE ROOT TO THE TIP.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
    <li> My hair was silky,smooth and shiny after I using this product. This product didn&#x27;t weight down my hair.  I must say the bottle is very small but you only use a small amount mixed with your conditioner.</li>
    <li> I applied it to some Aussie conditioner, mixed it up and let it sit for about 10 mins. Then after washing my hair very well, I applied it and allowed it to sit on my hair with a plastic cap for about 45 mins. When I washed it out and blow dried it, I noticed some strength in my hair but not as much as I was hoping. It wasn&#x27;t til the next day, for some reason, my hair felt more like how I was hoping for. They only reasons I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the strength could have been a little better in my hair..maybe I will try just a little bit more than what the directions say next time and see other results. Also, not much comes in the bottle. Overall good product though 😊</li>
    <li> Fast shipping A++ . This stuff has been amazing! I am half Mexican and African American, with more of the Mexican type of hair. I moved out of state and didn&#x27;t know who to go to for highlights so I tried Hair Cuttery. It turned out to be a disaster. They over processed my hair and my hair started breaking really bad. I then started spending lots of money on hair treatments at a different salon but had to stop because the price was just to much.I&#x27;m so thankful to have found this product, it has truly been a blessing and the price is unbeatable. It&#x27;s great being able to use in the comfort of your own home and saves you from the the ridicules salon price for a hair treatment.</li>
    <li> I have bought 3 bottles of this product and will continue to buy it as long as it is on amazon.  It works well on all types of hair.  I would rather use this product than buy products that have keratin as the sixth ingredient.  I am thoroughly satisfied with this product and it works well on ethnic hair if tere is someone wondering.</li>
    <li> Have used so far.  Am totally pleased with how my hair responds.  It is thicker, shinier, easir to style, curls last through 2 weeks after use.</li>
    <li> I have medium strand, medium to normal porosity, kinda thin to medium thickness, coarse 4b mostly 4c to 4z natural hair that is about or almost shoulder length and i have to say that this stuff is OH MY JESUS incredible. The smell is like something from Heaven, my 5 yr old nephew thinks it smells like Bubblicious cotton candy.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that it is only a little over 1 ounce of product. I wish i could put it directly onto my hair without adding conditioner but it isn&#x27;t really fiscally feasible for me to buy 2 or 3 of these a month at 15 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Also the Argan oil is super present in this product, You will feel its residue with just a little cap full in your conditioner, just make sure you mix something like 2 ounces of conditioner with the cap full at a time So that you get a more potent mixture.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed mine with Giovanni conditioner products; a little Nutrafix Hair Reconstructor,Smooth as Silk Deeper Moisture and Direct Leave-In. Also a little Desert Essence Coconut Soft Curl Hair Cream , with a splash of extra pure Hydrolized Wheat Pprotein and Quaternized Honey (Honeyquat). All this in about a 3 ounce pump bottle that pretty much covered my entire head.&lt;br /&gt;Plz try...its something else</li>
    <li> works great but doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I use high quality shampoos and conditioners, hair masks and leave in oil treatments. My hair is heavily processed. I noticed a difference when I started using a keratin shampoo recently. I&#x27;ll stick with it instead. I gave it 2 stars because it smells alright.</li>
    <li> Mixed a capful with moisture hair mask, left it on my hair (covered), while I cleaned house and my hair went from dry and puffy to smooth and shiny. No kidding.  I think you need to give it time to penetrate. I&#x27;m really pleased with the result.</li>
    <li> Thank you.  My hair needed this so bad.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be as good as baby face but it wasn&#x27;t at all. It separates in its bottle and when you shake it up it just looks like salad dressing. Maybe it was the hot summer weather at delivery time, but this never worked as well as the other brand.</li>
    <li> I had a perm two weeks ago, and it dried my hair severely, fly away, and felt wirey. I used this protein product today, left it on for 30 minutes and then let it air dry.  Used calista rollers on it this evening and now it looks smooth, and feels soft.. Hope it works just as well the next time I use it.  Will have to wait to determine if I&#x27;ll need to use it every time I wash my hair, but so far so good,</li>
    <li> It hasnt helped my hair at all..worst product ever</li>
    <li> This product is an excellent addition to conditioner.  This is a high-quality product at an unbelievably low price.  Order from her etsy page if you do not like the scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gives the hair good treatment</li>
    <li> I have thick soft straw coils with some deep waves just past shoulder. It&#x27;s relatively neutral (i.e. not dry, not oily) and behaves, for the most part, but I&#x27;m in the process of growing my hair out. That regimine includes adding a few supplements to my diet (i.e. collagen, biotin, and vitamin C), plus regular deep conditioning and protein treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research, I decided on the Protein RX because I liked the ingredients, and it has certainly made a difference.

I add a cap and a half full to my favourite deep conditioner, slather it on my damp hair, pull the shower cap on, do some housework, and then rinse it out. Very simple. And after each treatment I&#x27;ve noted that my curls are actually softer, springier, and my hair is more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test that it really was the Protein RX making the difference, I&#x27;ve gone a couple treatments without using it and although my hair was moisturized, my curls weren&#x27;t as soft nor my hair as manageable. My only real gripe with the product is the scent. This would have been a solid 5 stars, but for that reason. It&#x27;s quite sweet, in a saccharine sort of way, and doesn&#x27;t play nicely with my conditioner&#x27;s fragrance (the scent of which I prefer). On the plus side, once I wash the conditioner out (and double rinse), the scent fades when I apply my leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> It at first leaves hair a little sticky ... a little hard, but when you dry it gets soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;my hair was very dry, so it was easy to notice the change</li>
    <li> So far so good - my hair is breaking and I need something stronger though - didnt stop the breakage - but makes my hair soft</li>
