<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this! Leaves my hair shiny and bouncy, and I like the scent. I don&#x27;t know how it would work if I used it everyday. I usually alternate days with regular shampoo and conditioner because I have very fine and thinning hair, and I don&#x27;t want to risk too much product buildup because it might weigh it down. However, sometimes I use it two days in a row, and my hair still has body. I just thoroughly wet my hair, massage about five pumps into my roots (I don&#x27;t need the 10 recommended because my hair is thin!) then down to the ends, adding one or two extra pumps if it&#x27;s still tangle-y. Leave it in a couple minutes and rinse out and done! So quick and  convenient.</li>
    <li> great price, just tried it and love it so far</li>
    <li> It smells good like wen, but it doesn&#x27;t work like it. It made my hair really frizzy where wen tames it and leaves me with nice curls. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always always had fine hair, and i&#x27;ve used loads of products, permed, and dyed my hair. I recently started trying to grow it out about two years ago. Problem was I had a lot of damage. I switched my dye to henna, and waited for the permed hair to grow out. that said I was still having an awful time with split ends due to my impossibly fine hair. it was infuriating because i&#x27;d stopped dying, and i don&#x27;t style my hair at all, not even to blow dry on a regular basis. switched to a salon quality shampoo at stylist suggestion. tried pureology and LOVED it.but my bank account didnt. tried just going for more natural shampoos, and though my hair was healthier, it still just felt bla. decided to give up and just be happy my hair wasnt dead. ran out of shampoo on a trip home and swung into a drugstore to get something quick. saw Ren, and remembered hearing about Wen. honestly thought they were the same thing. a month later im IN LOVE. my fine hair has never been softer or thicker feeling. i have quite thick hair, but because it was so fine it would get weighed down by shampoos/conditioners easily and just lie limp. Ren keeps it fluffy and soft, i&#x27;ve never been happier with my hair. even my boyfriend noticed. you know it works when the boys notice! haha. as far as the greasy heads go, you hair is stripped every time you shampoo with normal lathering shampoos. but it also makes you produce more oil faster. Ren is natural and non lathering, so it doesnt strip your hair like that. which means, until your scalp gets used to the switch, it will keep over producing oil, (this may be familiar to anyone who knows of the \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; method). Don&#x27;t worry it does go away if you stick with it. The first week, thankfully I was on vacation, so the greasy scalp was manageable, and not too embarrassing, but once past that I&#x27;ve never had better hair!</li>
    <li> I liked it way better than regular shampoo and conditioner, however I did like the Lisa Rachel better, this feels a little too much like lotion.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite shampoos. I found it as a knockoff to Wen and was so much happier with this. It smells amazing, my coworkers even comment on how nice it smells. It also never leaves my hair greasy, which wen could sometimes do. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone using a cleansing conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was an avid WEN user for years but I ran out and had to find something quick. I LOVE this stuff, I&#x27;ll never switch back. The directions are a bit misleading tho. I have thick, mid-back length hair. I use 36 pumps every time I cleanse. 6 on top, 6 each side, 6 at the crown and 6 on each side in the back. Get it wet to, for lack of a better word, lather and with a wide tooth comb, spread it through my hair, its gonna feel horrible, trust me. Let it sit a few minutes (I&#x27;ve went as long as an hour) and rinse. The magic happens with the heat! I either blow dry or air dry and straighten. My hair has honestly never been healthier. I dunno what it is with the heat but it works like magic. I cleanse 2-3 times a week.</li>
    <li> Love love this cleansing conditioner, I have crazy Irish hair. People tell me all the time my hair looks fried. After using this, I have people asking what I&#x27;m doing. My hair looks great ! Now when you use this it don&#x27;t suds up, but get cleans great.</li>
    <li> Compared to Wen this product needs extra conditioner...too drying</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but I used it just like I would a shampoo + conditioner combo, and my hair is fabulously silky today!  I can&#x27;t wait for my daughter to use it, who is really the one I bought it for.  She has very thick, full, curly, and coarse hair.  I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cleanser for my hair.</li>
    <li> I just found out about Renpure on Amazon, I have to say I love it.  My hair has never been as soft and shiny.  I dye my hair once a week and my hair was super damaged and I have to say after using it one time my hair is Beautiful.  I was an avid user of Wen but can&#x27;t afford it anymore this is even better and a third of the cost,  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to my friends...</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I purchased this product elsewhere. When I first started using Renpure cleansing conditioner, I was impressed. My hair was soft, silky and felt very clean after rinsing. However, shortly after starting, my scalp started itching (I thought this was due to switching to a cleansing conditioner) but I kept using it, hoping it would stop after a few uses. It subsided some and was not really bothering me much, but then I started noticing more than the normal amount of my hair was \\&quot;shedding!\\&quot; I noticed some hair around the drain in my shower so I took the cover off and there was a clump of hair stuck that was the size of a large mouse (which was not there before because I had recently cleaned the shower drain!)  I really wanted to love this stuff, but now I have an itchy scalp and thinning hair! I don&#x27;t normally have a sensitive scalp. I just bought some SheaMoisture no-poo and conditioner and am hoping that will rescue my poor scalp and hair. I did give this product 2 stars because it did leave what is left of my hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! I would highly recommend this product to every one!! If you want, you can buy wen but at almost 3xs the price why would you ! This product is just as good and cheaper, and leaves your hair looking great.</li>
    <li> Love this! Smells good and my hair is so soft. Works better for me than Wen!</li>
    <li> I love the cleansing conditioners! I use the mint in the summer as it&#x27;s little lighter than the pomegranate the pomegranate can be a bit heavy for my hair but still fine in the winter for me. I do use about a cup of vinegar and 4-5 cup water rise for my hard water which is what I have done for 25 years after every shampoo to prevent hard water and product build up on my hair. It was first recommended to me by my beautician when I got a perm and my hair started to drip purple and she said it was from hard water and told me what to do to prevent it. I&#x27;ve been doing it ever sense because it makes my hair feel so nice. I have found and I do recommend using the vinegar and water while the cleansing conditioner is still in the hair and a light water rinse after for best results. Add a small touch of cleansing conditioner to towel dried hair and I nor anyone not even my mother with her super sensitive should have worked as a perfumer nose can smell the vinegar. I also like to add some lavender and Rosemary essential oils to mine, it thins it out a little but it works well either way.  Last thing is I just found the Lavender Ren Pure cleansing conditioner at my local something with a &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; drug store and haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere else. I&#x27;ve got it but haven&#x27;t had the chance to try it yet and can hardly wait!</li>
    <li> Smells great, but I was hoping this would help in my goal to not wash my hair too often.  When I use this, which seems to be made from mostly oils, my hair looks great but is extremely oily the next day.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I dye my hair and I find this product really conditions and detangles it.</li>
    <li> I purchased some Wen and immediately fell in love with it, but like the some others didn&#x27;t want to shell out the $30+ dollars a month for some hair care.  I came across this and decided to try it because it was about 1/4 the price of my wen.  I really like the renpure cleansing conditioner.  The pomegranate is a sweet fruity minty smell and smells good.  I don&#x27;t think the renpure is as moisturizing as the wen is but my hair is actually shinier with the renpure just not as soft.  I love the way the mint feels on my scalp like it&#x27;s really cleaning, and I have had no problems with greasiness like others have.  I really massage it in my scalp then apply more to my ends and run my fingers through hair to help detangle then I take a wide tooth comb and comb the product through my hair and let it sit the rest of the shower.  When its time to  rinse I wet my hair and rub through my scalp again and make sure all the product is out of my hair and rinse with cold water.  When finished I squeeze the excess water out of my hair and apply a pump as a leave in conditioner.  I really love how the renpure cleansing conditioner makes my hair look.  I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;m a former Wen user, but it was getting expensive. I tried this after reading the reviews and thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong for $6.99. I&#x27;m so glad I did! My hair and skin are both dry, but now my hair is soft and shiny, and it actually really cleansed my scalp well. The scent is not as overpowering as Wen either-I got the pomegranate.</li>
    <li> Has changed my hair!  I have no issues with it whatsoever and it makes my hair super soft and so manageable.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad to me at all, and I have a rather sensitive sniffer.  I follow the directions on the bottle and have never had anything but great results.  I&#x27;ve already ordered 2 more bottles so I make sure to never run out!</li>
    <li> just not my kind of shampoo hate the smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a sulfate free shea butter shampoo that I had gotten at Sprouts in the past, and it left my hair greasy feeling and looking.  To give you an idea of my hair profile, it is long, thin, and gets very oily.  I&#x27;m one of those people who can&#x27;t go a day without washing, and if I don&#x27;t wash my hair for a day, it is noticeably greasy looking. After seeing this on sale and reading that it was similar to Wen, I had to give it a try.  Surprisingly, it did not leave my hair greasy looking or feeling; it actually felt clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a few more pumps than what was recommended on the bottle, because my hair is down to my waist, and made sure to massage it into my scalp.  I&#x27;m quite sure that I have very hard water, since it did not lather up very well.  My hair was quite tangled, and since it&#x27;s processed and fragile, I didn&#x27;t really want to mess with it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I towel-dried my hair, I added a couple of pumps to help de-tangle my hair.  I don&#x27;t know if I would call it de-tangling, it still took some effort to brush through my hair.  It was a bit sticky at first, and I was afraid that when it dried it would look greasy, but it didn&#x27;t.  My hair was fairly soft, and the best part was that there weren&#x27;t globs of conditioner residue in the bathtub drain net that normally causes my pipes to get backed up from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the cons: I didn&#x27;t love is that it seemed that more of my hair fell out than usual, but it&#x27;s only my second day of using the product so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my imagination.  Also, the hydrolyzed vegetable protein concerns me, as I have read that it is actually MSG, and I have no idea why that is being used in the product.</li>
    <li> Contents work but the bottles pump does not</li>
    <li> My hair is (or was) very thick and healthy and soft. In about a week, this dried out my hair so badly that it started to become constantly tangled. I stopped using it but I honestly could not get it back to what it was and I had to cut some substantial portion of it off because the tangles were so bad. I do NOT know what is in this stuff and I cannot believe a simple cleansing product could do such a number on hair but there is some very strange ingredient in it that strips the hair shaft or the cuticle or something.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month now, the first use didnt go so well but after a week and a half i loved it, now i just really like it. Funny thing is that the reason i dont like it as much is that its really doing its job. I have been wanting to try a sulfate and paraben free shampoo and just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend the money on Wen so i decided on this. Im glad i did because it seems to do a good job at cleaning my hair and defiantly keeps it moisturized but the longer i used it the more often i have to use it. With shampoo i washed my hair every 3-4 days, the first 3 times i used this was the same but the longer i used it it seemed my hair was getting heavy and oily on day 2 and my scalp starts to itch like crazy if i try to go more than 2 days without using this. I believe this is from the fact that this product does not strip the oils from the hair like shampoo and the longer i use it the more oil is accumulating, so it actually is doing what it is suppose to do. I have chin length a line cut and 6 pumps is more than enough, i went overboard and used 8  pumps the first time and it was way too much. One major difference i have noticed is that bed head is almost an impossibility since i have started using this. I can wake up quickly run a brush through my hair and it falls right into place without needing to spray with water. My hair also feels much softer after use and smells wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this, than I read the reviews.  Although on all the negative reviews i think I would probably agree if I was straightening my hair, but since I \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot; it in the summer months, it seems to be ok.  I have long, wavy, fine hair but a decent amount of it.  My hair is not oily.  I wash it about 3 maybe 4 times a week.  I have used this twice.  Tuesday night and Thursday night.  I feel like the next time I wash my hair, it will need regular shampoo.  Since I can disguise my hair with curls I may just try this again just to have a better understanding of the product.  I think if I was going to straighten my hair after using this, I&#x27;d have to have a good shampoo in the wash prior - like starting over and then give it a go.  This being my second time using, I do know that it would feel gross and be unmanagable if I tried to wear it straight.</li>
    <li> 3.5* ---  Cleans just as good as Wen, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling slippery or &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;, but cleanses just as well.  I would suggest using this with a good creme rinse if you have dry hair.  A good, natural rinse will be just as good, and NOT $2/oz.,  like Wen.</li>
    <li> I have flirted with the shampoo free lifestyle a few times, but could never get to a point where it worked for me. However, that all changed when I found this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and I love how clean and soft my hair feels now. It also has a really great scent that.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine turned me to RenPure because my hair is fine and hates almost every shampoo and conditioner out there. Heck, what is another waste of $10? I found the Swee Pomegranate at my local pharmacy and wow... I am in love. It left my hair so soft and NOT frizzy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is going to be my forever cleansing conditioner. They better not stop making it! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Wen before and was looking for a new shampoo at Target when I came across this.  I actually scanned it on Amazon and saw that it had good reviews, so I figured for $6.99, it was worth a shot.  Anyway, I didn&#x27;t hold out a lot of hope for it because of the price, but WOW.  My hair is longish, blonde, and VERY fine.  The shine was pretty much gone after years of abusing it with dyes and the ends were fried.  It was looking like old lady hair, honestly, and since I&#x27;m turning 40 next month, it was really bumming me out.  Anyway, I tried it and holy cow, I am in love.  From the first use (I did use considerably more than the bottle suggests) my hair came out of the shower shinier and looking healthier overall.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and can&#x27;t believe the difference.  I&#x27;ve spent MUCH more on shampoos/conditioners and haven&#x27;t came close to anything like this.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Best thing I have used to clean my hair, hands down. Unlike other non-shampoo cleansers, this one does not leave a greasy residue. I have thick, wavy, frizzy red hair that is just below my shoulders. Typically I couldn&#x27;t run a comb through it if it was wet. That has all changed with this product. Does my hair still get a bit frizzy, yes. But in this humidity that is no surprise. On the other hand, my curls are soft and beautiful, my hair is shiny and lively looking. Great product. I just bought my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I love that it makes my hair soft, but after many washes my hair feels like there some kind of film on it.&lt;br /&gt;It did begin to look like I never wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;What I did like is after washing my comb glides through with out a single tangle. Unlike before I would condition, condition, condition, and I would still have tangles and ripping my hair out and always look dry like hay.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! Some background: I have been using Wen for about 6 months. I love Wen, but my bank account does not. Until recently I had very long hair and was going through 16 oz a month and at $30 a pop...that&#x27;s a lot of moola. I am not a fan of Hair One, mainly because of the smell and how much alcohol is in it. L&#x27;oreal sulfate-free conditioner isn&#x27;t thick enough so I feel I have to use a lot and am spending half my shower pumping product. RENPURE is amazing! It is thick like Wen and smells divine--like a sugary, fruity treat. Instead of following the bottle directions, I used it as I would Wen pumps-wise. I love that this product has NO ALCOHOL (even Wen has alcohol at the top of the ingredient list which for me seems counter-intuitive). Also, I like that it has coconut oil in it. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Eventually, I may try this company&#x27;s argan hair products, but for now I relish in the fact that I found a true comp for Wen that is much friendlier on my meager budget. Enjoy! :)</li>
    <li> It smells pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t work like Wen or anything comparable. I only put it on my hair as a styling product now because it dries crunchy. For my curly hair, that&#x27;s fine. For its intended purpose, it does not work well as an all-in-one.</li>
    <li> Smells SO strong of chemicals er I mean fragrance and gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> A must have! It&#x27;s the same as Wen just a different label. Don&#x27;t waste your money just for the name.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure to expect but I got amazing results! I did use a bit more than suggested in the application but my hair wasn&#x27;t the least bit greasy afterwards. I did comb thru after applying on my wet hair and it rinsed out easily and my hair felt like it normally does after applying conditioner. On my hair (straight and fine but tons of it) this worked better than wen. For the price, its amazing!</li>
    <li> This is what I use to &#x27;wash&#x27; my hair, and my bi-racial daughter&#x27;s very curly and dry hair. I use the Deva Curl, Curly Girl methods as much as possible, and this is a great cleanser. The smell makes you want to eat it, so scrumptious!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I&#x27;ve tried WEN and I like this better.  My hair is happier as well as my wallet.  This stuff leaves my long wavy hair soft and manageable.  I have tried a lot of shampoo/conditioner combos but never found one that didn&#x27;t leave my hair either greasy or dry it out so it looks and feels like straw.  Renpure solves both of those problems for me, and my color last longer as well.</li>
    <li> Have been very happy with this cleanser.  Subtle scent, so if you&#x27;re looking for something that lingers after rinsing, this isn&#x27;t it.  Works great though and the price was right.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I liked Repure products, esp. the Argan oil conditioners. I was also looking to avoid the sulfates and lauryls that had given me split ends as a teen. I bought one bottle at my grocery store for 8 bucks, tried it, bought the remaining (3) bottles (guess it was a promo to the store.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, it smells pleasantly sweet and it didn&#x27;t take long to learn how to use it. I use a detangler after I towel-squeeze-dry it, comb out and blow dry. I have hair below my shoulders which I wash every other day because it&#x27;s a bit dry if I don&#x27;t. Any minty cleansers are too dry for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I touch up my roots with permanent color about every 2-3 weeks. Everything seems to be meshing nicely, so I hope Ren will keep in touch with my local stores!</li>
    <li> Hair smells great and feels like silk. Do not opt out because the concept seems foreign, you&#x27;re only loosing out on a great product.</li>
    <li> I stopped using shampoo about 4 months ago. Initially, I would just rinse my hair, but I found it difficult to detangle my hair after rinsing it. I have hip-length hair that is very fine and I usually have to use a lot of conditioner (an entire handful) just to make my hair manageable enough to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Renpure at a local drugstore (where it costs 11 dollars) and tried it out. It has a very thin texture and does not lather. The scent is pleasant. The bottle says to use 10+ pumps, but I find that I have to use 20 pumps or more because of how long my hair is. I put most of it onto my scalp and I massage it in. I add a splash of water and work it down to the ends of my hair. After I&#x27;m done with the rest of my shower, I rinse out the Renpure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a week of using Renpure, I noticed is that my hair seemed to be falling out more than usual. First, I thought it was postpartum hair loss. Then, after I did some research, I learned that many regular shampoos and conditioners contain binding agents that prevent detached hair strands from falling out, giving the illusion of more volume. In other words, even though most people lose about 100 strands of hair per day, many of those strands stay on your head attached to other strands of hair if you use volumizing products. Many people who stop using shampoo experience increased shedding because these 100 strands actually fall out instead of falling out and getting stuck to other strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months in, I notice that I lose about 10-15 strands of hair each time I use Renpure, which still alarms me, but I suppose it&#x27;s normal after all.  My hair is softer and in better condition than ever before.  It is so much easier to detangle, and I can go much longer in between &amp;#34;washes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note: I have gone through about 8 or 9 bottles of Renpure, and 3 of them have had defective pumps. I was unable to get the pump to work. Not the end of the world, but it&#x27;s an annoying manufacturing defect.manufacturing defect.</li>
    <li> This product feels disgusting in the hair, smells disgusting, and then the aftermath left my hair flayed, frizzy and dry- worse than had I used $1 shampoo like V05 or Loreal. Now 3 days later my scalp is so itchy, my hair is still gross though I&#x27;ve re-washed it. I am hoping there&#x27;s no real damage here. So upset. This product should not be on the market, for ethical reasons.</li>
    <li> wish it worked simehow but didnt do a thing for my long hair</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this product. It leaves my hair oily looking. I just do not like it at all</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I would compare it to the more expensive counterpart: Wen. I was dissatisfied and will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I see all the mixed reviews - it seems to be either loved or hated.  Well, I love it and here&#x27;s how I use it:  scalp only and with a great big handful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use maybe 20-25 pumps, enough to fill my palm.  I cover basically only my scalp, concentrating on the top of my head.  After I massage that in, I use an actual conditioner (Renpure&#x27;s Argan Oil conditioner) on the rest of my hair.  My hair looks completely clean and shiny for two days.  On the third day, I use dry shampoo which keeps me going another two days till I wash again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is color treated, very long, very thick, very fine.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I used any heat on it.  Because I wash it, at most, twice a week, I always feel like I lose a ton of hair.  But with this cleansing conditioner/conditioner combo, I definitely have seen much less hair in the sink and tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and my scalp is in better shape than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is only meh to me, but the scent of the Argan Oil conditioner more than makes up for that.</li>
    <li> If you follow the instructions, this shampoo is amazing! I have thick, wavy hair. This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that leaves my hair unfrizzy after use. My hair feels clean and smells great. If I let it air dry, it&#x27;s looks great. If I use the flat iron, it stays for days. I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I was buying it in Walgreen&#x27;s until they discontinued it.  It leaves my hair soft, shiny and easy to style.  I also like it becaise it is natural and not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> So far I love this stuff! I have bad dandruff and my scalp never feels clean enough unless I use selsun blue but I don&#x27;t like using chemicals. This stuff is great!!!!! I have bleached and somewhat heat damaged 3b-3c hair and man my hair looks great and feels so clean. I don&#x27;t even have to put tea tree oil on my scalp lol.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the drugstore I work at. I was interested in it because first, the company is from the same state as I am, and appears to be a smaller business. I wanted to support that. Secondly, I&#x27;d tried the L&#x27;Oreal conditioning cleanser and liked it fairly well, but the fragrance on that one is excessive. This one smelled nicer, so thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read and re-read the directions a couple of times to make sure I would use it properly. The bottle instructs to use 10-12 pumps - my hair is fine and shoulder-length, so I used 10, then added more water to my hair. This product didn&#x27;t seem to meld into my hair at all... I don&#x27;t know how to explain, it&#x27;s like there was no cohesion with the hair and scalp with the product. I know cleansing conditioners aren&#x27;t supposed to lather, but this felt a lot different than using the L&#x27;Oreal version. I spent a lot of time rinsing (or trying to rinse, anyway) the product from my hair. Finally, I gave up and figured that was as good as it was going to get. My hair was immediately very easy to comb, which was nice, but as it dried, I knew it was going to look terrible, and it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seriously looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in 2 days. I went around all day that day at work wondering if my co-workers thought I&#x27;d skipped my shower. It&#x27;s like I used Crisco to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my hair. If I only used 8 pumps, I don&#x27;t even know if that would help. This stuff is like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be taking it back to where I got it. If it didn&#x27;t have so many negative reviews, and if I hadn&#x27;t had such a poor experience, maybe I&#x27;d give it a few more tries. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few cleansing conditioners, and this Renpure about mid-level as far as quality. I will be comparing this to WEN, because that is by far the best (in my opinion), so that is where I set the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Doing the math, I ended up paying about $0.61 per ounce with Ren, compared to $1.37 per ounce with Wen. At first glance, this seems like a great deal. Well, it&#x27;s not as great as it sounds, because I had to use a LOT more Ren to get my hair saturated vs. Wen. I don&#x27;t follow the directions on the bottle, I just put enough in to the point that my hair is soaked and soft. With Wen, it&#x27;s about 6-8 pumps. With Ren, it was about 14-18 pumps, and it is much thinner. That&#x27;s about twice as much product, so there goes the illusion of price savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: I did not like the pomegranate scent, it was like a sickenly sweet scent. I think I probably would have like the other scent better, but I did not like this one. The smell actually upset my stomach a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it work??: Yes, but not as well as I would have liked. I get dry, itchy scalp, and this seemed to irritate my scalp more than normal. Wen makes my scalp and hair feel great. Ren was much harder to work into my hair, and didn&#x27;t create that silky, almost unreal soft hair feeling like Wen. My hair IS still soft after drying, but in the shower it did not feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I&#x27;ve been spoiled by Wen. I didn&#x27;t mean for this to come off so biased, but I can&#x27;t help comparing the two. If you are just venturing in to the world of cleansing conditioners, this might not be the best place to start. You may have to try several different brands to find the one just right for your skin/hair type. I&#x27;ll be sticking with you know what until I find a cheaper, comparable alternative. I am thinking about trying Lisa Rachel or maybe the L&#x27;oreal type next.</li>
    <li> I was not happy at first. I was flying out to the Caribbean and used the cleaning conditioner before I left. My hair was like greasy straw. So I put it up and went on vacation. Once I got to my hotel I was able to brush out my hair. WOW. It looked full and healthy. I used it every day. Normally I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day because it&#x27;s so long. But I was on St Maarten and even the air is salty. After a week of salt, sun, sand and sea my hair was still beautiful.&lt;br /&gt; I usually let it absorb into my hair during the shower. I use it first and rinse it out at the end of my shower. Sometimes I use a little as a leave in detangler.&lt;br /&gt;  I still use other Renpure shampoos and conditioners from time to time. I find it is the secret to great hair. Before I found Renpure I paid $20 for shampoo and $20 for conditioners.</li>
    <li> I love it. My hair never felt this good.</li>
    <li> I just tried this product a few days ago and I love it! I tried Wen I&#x27;m the past and also loved it but is very expensive. This product is a more inexpensive version but gives the same result as Wen: beautiful manageability, shine, tangle free, amazing body. I have fine hair and it does not cause my hair to be greasy or dull. It is a little more watery than Wen, but I find it to spread more evenly in my hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now with poor results.  I&#x27;m familiar with cleansing conditioners.  And this product is very watery!  It leaves my hair feeling like straw, harder to comb.  The next day, my hair is limp and in need to be washed.  The smell is ok( Sweet Pomegranate) but it really lingers, too long.  I have wavy/curly hair and this product makes my hair frizz when left to air dry.  Wen makes my hair curl up beautifully and no frizz when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not even close to Wen.  Wen is thicker, easier to work with.  Wen is far superior.  And I&#x27;m not even a real Wen fan.  It&#x27;s funny when companies try to capitalize on the success of another product but make a poor quality, inferior product.  And they package and name it similarly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious of this product and now I have my answer.  No way I would buy this product again.  Target sells this for $6.99.</li>
    <li> Uses this product for the first time and am hooked!!! Never will use anything else to cleanse my hair with!!! Not only did it clean my hair great but it also strengthen my hair like no other product has ever before WOW NO MORE BREAKAGE!!! If you try this product your hair will love you forever!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using renpure Rosemary peppermint for about 3 months now. I clense about twice a week and wash my&lt;br /&gt;Hair with DILLUTED Dr bronners  once a week. So far my hair has gotten softer, healthier, bouncier, its genuinely awesome. I love this product, it is not meant to lather, it does cleanse and the peppermint oil gives your scalp a fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when ordering this because I had been using Wen for the past two years but….it&#x27;s so expensive and really adds up if you wash your hair often. I like this product because #1 your hair color (if colored) does not fade as with other shampoos and #2 it&#x27;s really so much less expensive and #3 it is self conditioning. What&#x27;s not to like? I give this one a 5 star rating and will buy this  instead of Wen in the future.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good shampoo that does not have sulfate in.  WEN was way too expensive, but then I found this Renpure.  It&#x27;s great.  Lasts much longer than WEN...the smell of the Sweet Pomegranate one is really nice and lasts for quite a while...My hair is soft and clean after using this.  I&#x27;d recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants a top shampoo at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Wen user, but open to something new and obviously cheaper. This product is very, very runny. Thin to the point that I couldn&#x27;t really control where on my head it was going. I have shoulder length, thick curly hair and although I liked it once it was in my hair, the smell and thinness of the no poo will prevent me from using it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this at walgreens because I was low on cash, needed conditioner and this was 2 for 1. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much thinking it was just a knock off of wen (which I used before and it was a terrible disappointment) but I was pleasantly surprised after using this to say the least. My hair is think and coarse so everything I use is loaded with oils and moisturizers which just weigh my hair down but don&#x27;t get rid of all the frizz. After I used this I noticed the difference right away after letting it air dry. It didn&#x27;t start to poof out and there was no little hairs sticking straight up near my roots. After it dried completely there was no layer of frizz on top Like there usually is and it had a healthy shine and lightweight feel. It was like it returned my hair to it&#x27;s natural state and it also smells terrific! I can&#x27;t wait to straighten it to really bring out the shine.</li>
    <li> If I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday it is really greasy so I have been using a reg shampoo once a week to help with the oil. It is not as good as Wen but it is a fair substitute. If you have military commissary privileges I saw it on the shelves for $6.99 at Ft. Hood</li>
    <li> Full disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;ve never used Wen, but I have heard glowing reviews from people who do.&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;ve never used any cleansing conditioner product, just shampoo, conditioner and miscellaneous deep conditioners &amp; leave in products (probably a good proportion of the popular products available, never been impressed with any of them).&lt;br /&gt;3. I have a TON of medium thickness, very dry, very damaged, split end, color treated, long, wavy hair, which I hate to cut because it always looks so much worse afterward.&lt;br /&gt;4. I have zero product loyally. Too many years of getting excited to find the holy grail of hair care and being left disappointed has left me a jaded person.&lt;br /&gt;5. I wash my hair once a week and use lots of dry shampoo (homemade cornstarch &amp; cocoa powder concoction after realizing the alcohol in most dry shampoo&#x27;s was giving me split ends on my little baby hairs).&lt;br /&gt;6. I really don&#x27;t use any heat on my hair. Years of daily straightening and blow drying left my hair horribly damaged (chlorine from year round swim &amp; water polo practice didn&#x27;t help either). Maybe I&#x27;ll curl my hair for NYE, Christmas or Vegas, but it takes soooo much time.&lt;br /&gt;7. I bought this at Grocery Outlet for $7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So onto the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a good chunk of the Amazon reviews: lots of love and hate for this product. I wont go over the method, because it&#x27;s much better written in other reviews. I firmly believe no single product will work for everyone, because everyone&#x27;s hair and body is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So literally my one and only time using this was this morning. My hair feels very clean, voluminous and a little dry. Next time I&#x27;ll try putting it also on my ends and using leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen many times in the past, but the expense was just too much!! I started looking for another product and stumbled on Renpure. Renpure works just as well as Wen, if not better.....I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their hair shiny, clean and reduce split ends. I have long thick hair, if it will work for me then it will work for all of you.................I would like another fragrance to try, but I don&#x27;t see another fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;  Robbie28</li>
    <li> I have never tried Wen or any one step cleansing/conditioning system before. This is a great product. My hair is softer, smoother and looks even better the next morning!</li>
    <li> Works so well!  No build up like other cleansing conditioner products.  My hair looks awesome and smells great</li>
    <li> I have used WEN and HairOne cleansing condition, but decided to try Renpure since the price wasn&#x27;t bad and I was in a pinch.  I thought the Renpure was very thin and watery in texture, and the smell overly sweet.  It did clean my hair and the results are fine, but I do like a cleansing conditioner that has a little more substance to it.  Not my first choice, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Best ever...far nicer to hair than Wen</li>
    <li> Also very nice and the thing is this stuff is not tested on animals. It is not laden with chemicals either. Nice smell, gets better with more use.</li>
    <li> My hair looked like the WEN commercial, but without having paid $$$ too much!!  Very pleased and will definitely make it my choice here on.&lt;br /&gt;I have loose curly hair that I&#x27;ve been wearing curly for about two years - leaving behind years of drying my hair straight!  Argh!  Just the other day since using this (Pomegranate) for the last week, my hair not only looks better, but on an icky, drizzly day, I was complimented on how my hair looked!&lt;br /&gt;(Cantu coconut curly cream makes a great styling cream for curl definition.)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, because of the claim it adds bounce to my curls. My hair is softer, with use of this product but the curling claim fell short in accomplishing that claim.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the sweet pomegranate cleansing conditioner for 6 months.  It leaves my hair clean, shiny, and soft.  My hair feels healthy.  My only caution is the product does not lather, but that is typical of most cleansing conditioners.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a hard time with shampoo and conditioner lately. This is the answer to my prayers. I was worried that after two or three washes my fine textured hair would feel greasy, like it did with Wen or the Sally Beauty Supply version of cleansing conditioner. Not so. It has a nice smell. It leaves my hair soft and shiny and clean. Very soft. Even after I blow dry. This is the best stuff. I will try the other formula&#x27;s. I bought mine at Target for about $7.</li>
    <li> A friend had this shampoo and encouraged me to try it. It was different because there isn&#x27;t any lather. But when my hair dried and I saw and felt how wonderfully clean and soft it was, I was hooked!</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product that we have used on my daughter&#x27;s hair that has ever really worked.  We used to use conditioning shampoo and then tons of condition to help with the long, dry, tangly mess....NOW she has soft and beautiful hair without frizz.  Here is the deal.  You have to use like 15 pumps of it and then scrub hard and add water.  Then leave it on for 3 or 4 minutes and rinse well.  After a few weeks of this you will wonder why you ever used shampoo.  We made the mistake of shampooing my daughter&#x27;s hair last night and today her hair is dry, fly away, frizzy, and tangled again.  We will NEVER GO BACK. This stuff is awesome even for my oily, flat, dyed hair.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN and decided to give this a try.... it was okay for awhile... but now I notice when using it.... I am loosing a LARGE amount of hair.... which with my thin hair... is totally NOT GOOD.... so back to WEN....you pay for what you get.  This also has a runny consistency...not like the thick WEN....</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Don&#x27;t understand bad reviews. I just followed directions and my hair is luxuriously soft and manageable. Will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> My favorite cleansing conditioner I have ever tried! I even like it better than Wen. It takes a little getting used to, but I have never had such soft hair, and it almost never falls out anymore. I have to use much more than it calls for, but I can&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo after this. (PLEASE don&#x27;t discontinue this product!!!) Great ingredients, no chemicals, and best hair of my life! :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how it makes my hair look! Also, it&#x27;s a whole lot less expensive than Wen!! I wish it was a little thicker, though. It&#x27;s hard to get the right amount in your hand without it running through your fingers before you have a chance to put it on your hair. But other than that, I love it!!</li>
    <li> The first 3 times I used it I was not impressed.  On the fourth try, my last try or else I was going to return it, I used more, brushed it while in the shower and spent a good 3-5 minutes rinsing it out.  Every time before this it would leave spots of my hair with a nasty film, but not all of it, so I knew it worked it was just a matter of getting it to rinse clean.  This time I finally got it, my hair dried out and curled very nicely. I don&#x27;t know that I would buy this again once the bottle is gone though.  I might try the Sally Beauty version instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you must use more than you think. It is supposed to dissolve oils and dirt and wash them away, so you may need more than just enough to coat the hair. You need enough to bind to the dirt and oil in your hair and take it with it when you rinse.  I used about 15-20 pumps. I have copious amounts of fine, long hair so it is difficult to get it to rinse cleanly all the way through.</li>
    <li> I love it.Smell great,but I do need the more help on the dries.Great for fast touch ups too!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Very similar to the &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; idea.  You don&#x27;t need to shampoo.  Does a great job on my hair at a good price.  I&#x27;ll shampoo twice a week and use this alone the rest of the week.  Still trying to adjust to &amp;#34;no-shampooing needed&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I loved Wen, but had an allergic reaction to it because of the Chamomile.  For the last year I&#x27;ve tried 6 different &amp;#34;cleansing conditioners&amp;#34; and found nothing really close.  I was not hopeful because it was so reasonably priced - more so than any other product I had tried.  Surprise!  I love it even MORE than Wen.  My hair is silkier, smoother, shinier and the price is right!</li>
    <li> These products are great. I have used the mint, sweet pomegranate, and lavender and I am a fan off all 3. They have a great smell and a nice consistency. They are not a &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; so they don&#x27;t have suds, but that is what makes them so much better for your hair. My hair is silkier, healthier, and more manageable since using these products. Also, the directions say to use a lot of pumps, but I only use half the amount and apply to my scalp only (although occasionally I do all my hair). This product may not be for everyone, but my whole family likes it and we all have different hair types. My hair is curly and tends to get frizzy easily, my mom&#x27;s hair is very curly, my one sister has wavy hair, and my other sister has super straight hair. And we all use these products and love them.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleaning conditioner. Normally my hair is pretty big and curly, but when I use this product, my hair is a little sleeker, which is fine. The only complaint I have is I have to use it everyday or my hair gets greasy. When I used a regular (though sulfate free) shampoo and conditioner I could go two days without washing.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would be a replacement for Wen; it&#x27;s not. The search continues</li>
    <li> Does well in cleaning doesn&#x27;t leave hair as soft as Wen but what a terrific price. Comparison thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I love that I can get it at Target!  It&#x27;s not Wen, but a great generic!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try no poo method (with soda and vinegar), but after my husband raised his eyebrows on the idea (which never happens usually), I decided to scale back and use a cleansing conditioner to start.  I tried the green one from Renpure too (I think it&#x27;s mint and smth), but it made my hair a bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hair, and it&#x27;s long but all very thin and have lots of fly aways. This one (pomegranate) is the right  fit for my type of hair - hair actually looks washed and frankly I was able to go 2-3 days (for the 1st time in a LOOOONG time) without washing my hair and still felt like my hair was clean.  There are a lot of instructions on this one - here are my tips: (1) if you have long hair, you might need more than the recommended 12 pumps (just cover your hair with a very thin layer of this thing) and (2) don&#x27;t add any as a leave in conditioner (they sat you dan do it, but your hair will look greasy next day - at least if you have thinner hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is really pleasant and overall, after couple of washes, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or anything like that.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cowash.  You have to use a generous amount and leave it on for 10-15 minutes, but if you do this, your hair will get clean and will soft and manageable.  This cleansing conditioner is supposed to compete with Wen and as a long time Wen user I can say that it&#x27;s definitely on par.  It&#x27;s rather thin so you have to be sure that all your hair is completely soaked in the product and that you wait the required time, otherwise your hair won&#x27;t look or feel clean.  I used to use 24 pumps of Wen, but now my hair is shorter so it takes about 15 of the Renpure to do the job.  It smells great and has a pleasant minty tingle.  However, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger so if you&#x27;re sensitive to perfume, this may be a good option.  I used the Sweet Almond Mint Wen and I have to say that I like the fragrance of Renpure Pomegranate better.  I do use a significant amount of styling products and this formula definitely gets my hair hair very clean and what&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s very soft and supple and well hydrated.  I can go several days without shampooing when I use it because it doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oils (stripping causes even more oil to be produced in order to compensate, leading to extremely oily hair).  It does remove the styling product buildup and leaves my hair very manageable and amenable to styling.  I do wait a pretty long time before rinsing, only because it takes that long for the cleansing conditioner to work.  If you don&#x27;t wait the required time, you&#x27;ll find your hair not only isn&#x27;t very clean, but that it gets even dirtier even more quickly.  So there&#x27;s a trick to using a cleansing conditioner and once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ll get very good results.  You need to completely saturate your hair in the cleansing conditioner from roots to ends.  You can also use an additional hydrating conditioner on the ends if you feel you need it.  However, my hair is pretty normal and medium in texture and I&#x27;ve found that all I need is the cleansing conditioner because it does such a nice job of moisturizing my hair, which tends to be dry due to coloring and heat styling.  If you follow these directions, you&#x27;ll have good results.  Also warm water helps emulsify styling product buildup and if you rinse well before applying the conditioner, all the styling product residue will be washed out.  A three minute initial rinse should do the trick.  I recommend this cleansing conditioner for any Wen lovers out there who don&#x27;t like the high price of Wen and want something more reasonably priced.  I paid about $32 for the same size in Wen versus $10 for the Renpure cleansing conditioner.  However, you don&#x27;t need a specific cleansing conditioner to cowash.  Any conditioner will work as long as it&#x27;s the right formula for your hair type.  Chaz Dean made a fortune off an old idea.  Curly hair girls and women of color have long known about cowashing.  However, the invention of Wen brought the practice mainstream.  I also like VO5 Kiwi Lime conditioner as a cowash, especially in the summer.  It&#x27;s very light and leaves my hair bouncy with tons of body.  It&#x27;s just one of those cheap gems that works like a charm.  I use Renpure in the colder months when excessive dryness becomes an issue.  The directions I&#x27;ve outline apply to any cowash product.  I recommend Renpure for any hair type.  You can always supplement with a hydrating conditioner on the ends if your hair is really dry.er because it does such a nice job of moisturizing my hair, which tends to be dry due to coloring and heat styling.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I will definitely get more.  I have hair length a bit past my shoulders, but it&#x27;s very fine, so I find that 5 pumps is plenty for me.  It is enough to get my scalp well-cleaned then I just pull the rest of my hair upward and give it a rub too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was gifted some Wen from my mom and honestly, if I were to use the same scent of each brand from an unmarked container, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be able to tell the difference.  Very pleased with how my hair looks and feels using either product but this one is much more friendly on the pocket book.  I&#x27;m especially happy that this product doesn&#x27;t have any junk ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have very thick naturally curly hair.  However, it always is out of control, frizzy and I need to use a tremendous amount of products to try to keep it from looking poofy.  I&#x27;ve heard of similar products that have a heavy price.  I tried Ren while staying at a relatives home.  Wow!  What a huge difference it made on my hair.  I like to wear my hair straight, but spend over an hour trying to dry it and flat iron it, and still it only lasts half the day.  With Ren, it cut my \\&quot;getting ready\\&quot; time in half.  Not to mention, I&#x27;ve completely stopped using any other styling products on my hair.  It&#x27;s saving me money and counter space from all the styling products I used to use.  Some previous reviews say the product makes their hair feel greasy.  If you have thin hair, than this may not be the product for you.  But if you have thick hair like me, this stuff is the answer to your prayers. I thought it was a bit weird that this product does not foam.  After all, what shampoo doesn&#x27;t?  But you&#x27;ll quickly get over it.  Just because it does not foam, does not mean it&#x27;s not cleansing your hair.  Its meant to clean and condition in one step.  How many conditioners lather?  Even my husband (with a military style cut) likes it too.  I&#x27;ve been using it for months and am buying my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I tried this because the Renpure Organic line of products is such a great value and very good quality. I used this product two times then went to my hair appt. I have chronically damaged hair that breaks easy and is frizzy too. My hairdresser couldn&#x27;t believe the difference this product made. She said she has never seen my hair so healthy and that it was like a miracle product for me. She is now going to try some because she has the same type hair. It made my hair shiny and thick, without weighing it down. Also, since I started using it I haven&#x27;t used any styling products! I highly recommend it if you have frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> this leaves my hair feeling clean and soft but without any soapy residue</li>
    <li> Two stars because it smells nice. I have naturally curly hair and this product dried it out real bad. To get it to stop feeling so dry I used Suave Naturals Coconut conditioner as a leave-in, followed by a 50/50 mix of Grapeseed oil and Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Anti-Frizz serum. I still hate how dry this made my hair though and I don&#x27;t plan on using it again once I finish out the bottle. (For ten bucks I&#x27;m not going to waste it by throwing it out, not will I inflict it on anyone I know!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A much better cleansing conditioner that DOESN&#x27;T dry your hair out is As I Am Coconut CoWash. Eden Bodyworks has a really nice cleansing conditioner too.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I have seborrheic dermatitis and I cannot use most shampoos without breaking out every other week but with Renpure I have not had a break out in over a month!</li>
    <li> All this cleansing conditioner needs is slip, and it could take over the world.  It&#x27;s just that good!  The smell is like candy, the clean is perfection, and the curl definition on my 3b/c hair is miraculous!  When you first put it in your hair, it feels like it&#x27;s going to be a waste of time...but just let it sit in there for 15 minutes.  My hair felt like SILK!!  And it was Moist, and soooo soft.  I haven&#x27;t even finished the first bottle, and I ordered another 4.  And now I&#x27;m ordering 3 more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.  I&#x27;m just going to add cones to it myself, and give it the same slip that Wen has (Wen contains cones).  Then I&#x27;ll never have another bad day Again!!</li>
    <li> Cleansing conditioner is the way to go to keep your hair feeling clean with drying it out.  The sweet pomegranate smells wonderful, and leaves my hair so soft.  I am looking forward to trying other products in the Renpure line.</li>
    <li> Okay. So for the past 5 years I’ve been a diehard user of Wen- the “original” cleansing conditioner until I had some issues with their customer service. So when I saw Renpure for a fraction of the price in our local Jewel-Osco (I paid 7.99 for a buy one get one promotion) I  was skeptical.  And then I used it.  The first time I used Wen it left my hair feeling greasy and grimy and I just didn’t like it. Renpure on the other hand left my hair sleek, smooth, and shiny.  My waist-length, dyed black, thick messy hair was gone, replaced by smooth, soft bouncy curls and I couldn’t wait to use it again and get the same result! Which, I did, and have every time since I started using it almost 3 months ago—not to mention that in that three month time frame my hair which is usually semi-slow to growing has grown almost 7-9 inches.  You heard me right. That’s almost a FOOT of growth. That’s as much as it’d grow in roughly a year.  I couldn’t be happier.  It’s cheap, cost effective, and worth the money you pay for it.  I’m definitely not going to use anything else on my hair ever again in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my neighborhood drug store and frankly felt sort of foolish. I had instant buyers remorse because I though I fell for the oldest trick in the book...again. You know, give the product a nearly identical name and nearly identical packaging, and some fool (me) will either buy it accidentally thinking she&#x27;d gotten the best deal on wen ever OR being a huge cheapskate, will subject her poor hair to some knockoff hair care product to save a few ducats. I was the latter in this instance because I went it to it with my penny pinching eyes wide open. I liked the smell even though it kind of reminded me of fruit juice concentrate. Could be worse right? I used it according to the directions, which said 10 pumps (that seems like a lot but the amount that comes out with each pump is pretty small) and left it in my hair way longer then the bottle said...like 3 times longer ( I had read one of the other reviews and she said leave it in for 15 minutes). Now when I got out of the shower my hair felt like straw and I can admit that my inner beautician was repeatedly screaming \\&quot;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE\\&quot; \\&quot;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE\\&quot;?!?! I kept flashing back to the one negative review I read here and how horrible she said this product was and I was super disappointed.  I used a small amount of silicone hair defrizzer on my damp hair so I could rake a comb through it before I went to bed. I got up this morning and proceeded to straighten my hair as usual and a minor miracle occurred! *cue choir* My normally super hard to straighten, frizzy unruly hair LOOKS AWESOME!!! It&#x27;s got slip, it&#x27;s shiny and it&#x27;s smooth as heck!!! I will defiantly not think twice about shelling out the 10 bucks for this bottle again!!</li>
    <li> I tried this despite the bad reviews. I&#x27;m have to try it for myself kinda of person. The first few times it worked great. But it left a build up on my hair, so I switched to my regular shampoo and the build up was gone. I use it twice a week now. It&#x27;s okay, but if you&#x27;re looking for a Wen replacement... It&#x27;s not.  Spend the extra money and get the real thing.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product.  Makes my curly and sometimes freezy hair look great.  I use it when I first get in the shower and rinse it off after I bathe.  I have gotten several compliments on my hair after I started using it.  Love the fragrance, too!  Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I have heard the praises of Wen products, but they are way too expensive.  When I found Renpure Solutions I decided to give them a try.  I am so glad I did.  Great product, my hair feels wonderful and soft.  I can&#x27;t imagine that Wen is any better, especially NOT, at the minimum, 3 times more expensive better. Since not all of us are celebrities, or wealthy or try to live outside of our means, here&#x27;s a hearty thanks to the owners of Renpure for keeping their products at a price the rest of us \\&quot;regular\\&quot; folks can afford.</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN for about a year and love the product but find it expensive.  I thought I would save some money and try REN - big mistake!  It makes my hair feel greasy and weighed down.  After 3 uses I am ready to put it in the trash.  If you love WEN don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I have no clue where all the bad reviews are coming from.  I used this product for the first time today and my hair is incredibly soft and shiny!  But I did use it as a conditioner after using my regular herbal essence shampoo.  So I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference.  All I can say is my hair looks the best it&#x27;s ever looked in my 34 years of living.  I&#x27;m so happy to have finally found a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> I tried this because I have heard people raving about Wen.  Renpure typically makes top notch products.  (They used to own Aussie before it sold to Procter &amp; Gamble).  I had high hopes - I really did.  It wasn&#x27;t hard to understand and apply.  I used a little bit as a leave-in conditioner as the directions state because there was NO getting a comb through my hair.  As my hair dried, I realized the ends were dryer than ever, yet the top was like an oil slick.  And by the end of the day - it was absolutely disgustingly greasy.  So, basically, it does neither job - conditions or cleanses.  I&#x27;m going to use it as shaving cream.  (I bought this in a drugstore, not Amazon).</li>
    <li> OK  for &amp;#34;copy&amp;#34; of the actualy WREN product however I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. Item was for my personal daily use and one bottle is sufficient</li>
    <li> I love the Ren cleansing conditioner. I used it yesterday for the first time and I love this product. The scent is so great. and several of my co workers commented on how nice my hair looked. my hair is very curly and the curls look fantastic. I love that is costs only 10 dollars for a 16 ounce bottle unlike the Wen that cost 30 dollars a bottle. I would recommend this product to any one looking for an alternative to Wen.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews thinking it would be a healthy alternative to my regular shampoo/conditioner routine. It left my hair so oily and stuck to my head. The first few times I used it everything was decent, but after a week of use it was unbearable. I thought may I wasn&#x27;t rinsing enough, I even tried rinsing with cold water hoping that would help somehow. I eventually gave in and had to shampoo my hair twice to get it all out and clean!</li>
    <li> Very watered down...left my hair very brittle.  Try Pantene cleansing conditioner till WEN goes on clearance.  Oh I am using what I have left of this for shaving...it is amazing for that!</li>
    <li> I have had this sitting in my bathroom for about 2 months... Because I read to many negative reviews on it and wasn&#x27;t wanting to try it... Well I have been co washing with different products .. Ive tried the cantu co wash ... As i am coconut cowash and i wasn&#x27;t totally thrilled .. Well last nite i looked at the unopened product (renpure co cleanser) and decided just try it afterall I did buy it to try it ... OMG .. I feel so stupid for letting it sit in my bathroom this long without trying it ... Im noy sure about the bad reviews but i just dont see how ... My hair is texturized and curly but i wear it straight mostly.... This made my hair feel like heaven !!!! Im in love with this product ... Ive learned my lesson on letting neg reviews scare me ! My hair is fine but i have alot of hair and it weighs down easily .. Not with this stuff.. End result soft bouncy pretty smells amazing ... Detangles.. Hair feels so healthy and refreshed</li>
    <li> I have used Wen for 6 plus years on my wavy frizzy hair and I love it. However like most people the price made me search for alternatives over the years. Finally there were several options. I bought Renpure hoping it could replace my Wen. It is very thin more liquid consistency which makes it a bit hard to apply. The smell is a bit less naturally smelling than Wen and it doesn&#x27;t go through my hair and detangle it. It feels almost sticky in the shower. I must say it does an ok job though when it is dry. The smell is fine and the hair is soft. Overall though getting it through my hair in the shower is too difficult and sticky feeling so I won&#x27;t be using this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Here are my thoughts:  I think this product may be good for dry/damaged hair.  I have fine hair and lots of it, and it&#x27;s healthy.  Years ago I was sucked in by the Wen infomercial.  At the time, my hair was long and I dyed it.  Wen was OK, but didn&#x27;t notice an infomercial-like difference.  Certainly not worth the cost. I never have over-styled my hair - blow drying but no straight iron, hot rollers, etc.  A hair dresser once told me I had very healthy hair and probably had trouble holding certain styles just because of that.  (hmmmm...)  Now I have short gray hair (free from dye!).  I found Ren in a local pharmacy and decided to see if it had any impact on dull wirey gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;Nope.  In fact it was worse than Wen.  My hair felt waxy, oily, heavy -- yuck.  These conditioner cleansers may be effective on dry/damaged hair in some cases.  The idea is nice, but it&#x27;s not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;That said --- ALL IS NOT LOST.&lt;br /&gt;I remembered that some Wen reviews mentioned that the product made for a great shaving lotion.  This is ABSOLUTELY true!  I have very dry skin on my lower legs, and this product makes razors glide and moisturizes at the same time.  A little goes a long way, so this bottle lasts a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;So go ahead and give it a shot!  If it doesn&#x27;t work on your hair, try it on your legs with a razor!&lt;br /&gt;My four star rating is simply because the product didn&#x27;t work for me in the way it is marketed, but as a shaving lotion - it&#x27;s FIVE STARS!</li>
    <li> I used the pomegranate for the first time and my hair was horrible the tangles were awful I had to tee ash my hair with the shampoo I normally use will never again use I&#x27;m just upset I bought two different scents</li>
    <li> I just bought a bottle of Ren over the weekend after looking for a good deep conditioner to use on my baby fine, but permed hair.  After getting the perm 4 months ago, my hair has become progressively dry and lifeless looking, even after using daily conditioners and special shampoos.  I needed help; my hair had never looked so horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I decided to try Ren for the first time yesterday (actually, I mistook it for Wen initially, and had heard how great IT was.)  At under $10 a bottle, I figured Ren was worth a shot.  I got home from the store and turned to Amazon to read the comments on this product.  I was a little disheartened to see so many negatives, but hoped for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it yesterday, following the directions on the bottle exactly, using 10-12 pumps.  I worked it in well on my wet hair for 2-3 minutes, and then let it stay on my hair for 3-5 minutes, followed by a thorough rinsing.  I then set my hair on big rollers since I&#x27;m trying to avoid using a straight iron and damaging my hair further. When I took the rollers out, I was amazed at how much better my hair looked!  It had shine, bounce and life again! I got out of bed this morning, and my hair still looks so good, there was no need to wash/condition it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars since I&#x27;d like to continue using it for awhile first and see how things go longer term.  I don&#x27;t understand the negative comments about this product, though.  First of all, the scent is very pleasant, not off-putting like some reviewers claimed.  Also, my hair feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With naturally fine, straight hair, there&#x27;s always a chance with any product that too much of a good thing will weigh it down and make it look dirty.  I don&#x27;t know how often I will be able to use Ren, maybe not every day, but all I can say at this point is, so far, so good.  I&#x27;m so impressed, I&#x27;m going to keep using it, and if it continues to perform like it has already, I may have to changemy rating from 4 to 5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product, give it a try!  You may have great results like I have!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, curly hair that can turn into a rat&#x27;s nest pretty easy. I used to alternate between Wen and regular conditioner. Saw this and decided to try it.This product is ok, it works better than regular shampoo and conditioner but Wen is thicker and seems takes about 1/3 less to get a brush through my hair. It smells good too. Decent cheap alternative</li>
    <li> Says on bottle to use 10-12 pumps, I have short hair so I don&#x27;t use as much. It does not lather and consistency is not thick as conditioner. Does not feel the same as conditioner when applying to hair, i like the feel of regular conditioner on my wet hair better. I can&#x27;t tell a difference on dry hair. Still trying to get use to it. Haven&#x27;t seen an approvment to my hair. Have only used for 2 weeks and I still cheat with conditioner at times. I am using the pomegranate which smells great.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as an inexpensive alternative to Wen. Unfortunately it leaves my hair greasy and heavy, something I never worried about with Wen. The first time I used it I thought maybe I hadn&#x27;t rinsed well enough, but I tried it a second time and my hair was still stringy, oily, and heavy. The only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 was because it smells really nice, and the smell lingers after you shower.</li>
    <li> I travel for work, so I need a product that can \\&quot;do it all\\&quot;, so I don&#x27;t have to carry as many bottles with me. Like most, I&#x27;ve seen the WEN infomercials, but cannot justify paying so much for something that will run out that fast. So I did my research &amp; found many other brands that do the same thing. I&#x27;ve used this a few times so far, and I&#x27;m on the fence. When wet, my hair feels thickly coated &amp; is very hard to comb through. But once dry, my hair is soft &amp; shiny without any other product. I plan to mix a little regular conditioner in next time to see if that helps with the slip, but since I got this for $5, I figured if it doesn&#x27;t work, it wasn&#x27;t a huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> My kids made me buy it, there hair looks fine and the smell isnt&#x27; too strong.</li>
    <li> There is a reason this product has received more than twice as many 1-star reviews as it has 5-star reviews. I bought this because I love Renpure&#x27;s Amazing Miracle Hair Treatment and Renpure&#x27;s Moisturizing Shampoo. My drugstore stopped carrying both, so in a hurry and unable to do any research, I purchased this product. It has been the most colossal waste of 9.99 of my life. Another reviewer said it&#x27;s &amp;#34;like lotion&amp;#34; (yes) and several have written about how much greasier their hair feels (yes). Long story short, I can&#x27;t believe there is such a deceptive and disgusting product available on the market. Period.</li>
    <li> I had used WEN for about a year and decided to try Ren (could they be a little more original with the name).  I had horrible results, my hair (which is normal to dry) looked like someone dumped a bucket of grease on my head.  I trashed the bottle of Ren and went back to using WEN.</li>
    <li> Wen?!? Get out of here because this product is so much cheaper and works so much better. Will never go back to regular shampoo</li>
    <li> Use as directed and your hair will be soooo soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this stuff. Makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve used Wen by Chaz Dean for 3 years now and it&#x27;s amazing! But I saw RENpure cleansing conditioner in the hair aisle at Walgreens and thought well it&#x27;s cheaper and why not try it. Now I always look at reviews anytime I buy a product so I checked many reviews including here, and I felt confident buying it because the reviews were great. After purchasing it I decided to cleanse my hair with REN as soon as I got home, I needed to cleanse anyways. When I pumped the product into my hand I immediately got a smell of it and it was a distinct chemical smell. It did bother me, but I wanted to try it either way. As soon as I applied and massaged it into my scalp, my scalp began to BURN. It was the worst feeling ever, I than tried to rinse it out of my hair and actual CHUNKS of hair was at the floor of my shower.Returned REN immediately!!! I&#x27;m giving you all a warning. Try REN at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Used this in my girl&#x27;s hair, ages 2 and 4. One has super thick curly hair where you can barely run your fingers through it and brush it and the other one has fine curly hair. Didn&#x27;t work in there hair at all. Do not buy it is a waste of money. Made there hair stringy, frizzy and made it hard to get a brush through it. Wen is the best out of all the cleansing conditioners and is the only thing that works in their hair. Save your money by the time you keep buying all the knock off Wen&#x27;s you can just by the real Wen stuff.</li>
    <li> This is one of 3 cleansing conditioners I have tried and by far the worst.  The consistency is very thin, whereas others are thick, like conditioner.  It actually left my hair looking greasy &amp; limp (it did not look greasy before I washed it and thankfully I still had another brand so I re-washed)</li>
    <li> Nothing against the shipping .Received item in a timely manner.Product didn&#x27;t have any description as to what type of hair to use this product for.Made my hair flat.Dosent compare to WEN.This product is thin and runny.As far as the Win product you get what you pay for. I could have tried to return product, but didn&#x27;t want to bother with it.</li>
    <li> I am 50 and have very fine hair. It has no body and the ends always seem frizzled even though I take great care and don&#x27;t dry my hair alot or use any heat irons.  I thought I should go as easy on my hair as possible so I went sulfate free. That didn&#x27;t seem to change the look of my hair...still fine, limp and frizzled ends. My drug store had Ren on sale (buy one get one free) so I thought I couldn&#x27;t lose. They will also accept returns if I was unhappy with the product. I bought both pomegranate and rosemary mint and am shocked to tell you my fine hair has never looked better. The ends lay nice and smooth and my hair is not greasy at all.  It feels soft and healthy.  I finally found a hair product that works for me.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have tried a bunch of these cleansing conditioners, including WEN and Renpure. They are too much for my very very fine hair. Once makes my hair look wonderful. The next time I use it, my hair look slimed. Works much better for my granddaughter who has very curly and somewhat coarser hair. If you and the type of hair you have match the product, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> All the Renpure Solutions Cleansing Conditioners contain the same ingredients.  Why advertise different types when they&#x27;re all the same.  For what it&#x27;s price is, it is not worth it.  Dull, lifeless hair.  I would never buy this product again.  I think it&#x27;s a rip-off.  In fact, I threw it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather buy Pantene pro v this did not help my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this company and am super happy with this product! The key is to rinse well and realize it is not like other products!!</li>
    <li> My 1st fear was that I wouldn&#x27;t feel clean...let me just say that there is a mild tingling that let me know I was getting clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2nd fear was that my hair would be limp because it&#x27;s fine in texture...Oh my goodness!  Bouncy, shiny, soft and smells absolutly heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled that there is an affordable solution to gentle hair cleansing.  I will be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> Hey my thyroid is low and my hair has been breaking constantly. I just used it and it was great, my hair looks great, has slip and I love it. UPDATE, I can&#x27;t use it anymore and neither can my kids. It&#x27;s giving us really bad hair. My youngest has unbrushable tangles and it makes my hair feel really gross. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helping with my hair breakage problem either.</li>
    <li> I tried this product today. I wanted to love it, because it smells incredible. Unfortunately, though, it tangled my hair horribly and left it feeling like it hadn&#x27;t been conditioned at all. I had to use a separate detangler, and I still had an obscene amount of hair falling out when I brushed it, much more so than normal. I&#x27;m going back to my old shampoo.</li>
    <li> Ok, I tried this product several times and used the whole bottle just to be thorough. I never had good results at all with this product. First of all, the CC is thin and it disappears on your hair, so I would use more trying to get this stuff through my hair. I have thick, curly/wavy, colored hair past my shoulders. The label says this stuff melts in your hair well it obviously does just not in a good way. Forget about combing it through. That&#x27;s not happening. I followed the instructions, applied more than usual because of the way it \\&quot;melts\\&quot; into my hair, worked it through, and went about my regular shower routine. As soon as I started to rinse it out, my hair started to clump tohether in small sections and feel rough. The more I rinsed the clumpier it got. I applied some as a leave in while my hair was soaking wet, and almost combed my hair out with a few strands in the comb. As it dries it gets softer, however, it&#x27;s fuzzy and full of fly-aways. This was basically every time I used this product. It never improved. I would still have to use other styling products. Ren is not worth the $10 you pay at Rite-Aid. Save your money for something else. A normal shampoo and conditioner gives me better result than this product, sulfates or not.</li>
    <li> Adds volume to my limp hair. I&#x27;ve been a dedicated WEN user for years. I purchased Ren at Rite Aid out of curiosity.  It works differently than WEN.  The coconut oil sticks to your hair so it feels heavy when you&#x27;re in the shower.  A strand may even break off when your hair is wet and you can feel the coating of what I think are the oils.  All of the cleanser gets absorbed into your hair and you barely rinse any of the product off.  However, once you towel dry it, it feels fuller.  You don&#x27;t need any styling product.  My hair is fuller and less frizzy.  But because of the heavy coating, you would still need to shampoo off the residue every 2-3 shampoos.  I use WEN to get it squeaky clean again.  I rotate between the two shampoos.</li>
    <li> Other brands take five pumps this takes at least six, not a good value, but it smells good.  Will order Wei or Laurel again but not this Ren.</li>
    <li> At first I thought I had found a replacement to Wen. The first treatment was great but the second was a different story. When I wet my hair to start the treatment my hair felt like it had a thick layer of wax on it. I went ahead and used Ren. The results were not the same. My hair felt greasy and not so clean. My scalp also felt funny. Kinda like a numb feeling. It made my scalp itch. And it didn&#x27;t stay clean for as long as the first time. I hated to admit that it was not what I had been looking for.</li>
    <li> I have only used this Wen knock off once. I have naturally curly (hence sometimes naturally frizzy) hair and am forever searching for what will work for my hair. This Ren cleansing Conditioner felt like just that. It was not stripping like shampoo and it wasnt heavy like a pantene kinda conditioner. In the end, when I squeezed out the excess water, it felt \\&quot;just right\\&quot;, not exposed or stiff or strawlike. I dried and styled as usual with a little Got2Be kinkier curls spray, mostly air drying on the commute. Got to work and fluffed - big difference. Curles were better formed and it looked as if I&#x27;d used a little argan oil, which I hadnt so that was a bonus. Not at all greasy. THEN the next day when I brushed out my hair and curls before my shower was when I could really tell a difference. My hair would be fly away city most days when I do that until I smooth it out with some water or something but I couldve worn it to work. It just behaved my hair. Great product! Ive never used wen and now I dont need to!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin, long, whipcream curly; 50% white hair.  the top layer of my hair is alway dry and crunchy.  I have been a Wen girl for about as long as the product has been available but the cost, ouch.  I&#x27;ve been having issues with breakage lately so I thought I&#x27;d give RenPure a try: I wet my head, applied enough Ren to saturate my hair well ( about 20 pumps for me)  threw a towel around it ( bottle says leave it in for 3 to 5) then waited about 4 minutes and rinsed. No problem rinsing it out at all, I do not blow dry so air dried my hair was nice, soft, clean and when I brushed it out no dry crunchy white hair!  I&#x27;m sold.  Oh and my honey says the pomegranate smells nice.</li>
    <li> I have short, colour-treated, baby fine hair.  This product is great.  I can&#x27;t figure out why all the negative reviewers are saying it leaves their hair greasy - so not the case!  The first time I used it, I wanted to see how my hair would be if I used no styling products at all (not something I would ever be able to do with my baby fine hair!).  Texture and shine were great but my hair was too &#x27;flyaway&#x27;.  Next time I used it, I actually used the teensiest amount of conditioner and then my usual leave-in styling products.  Excellent results.  My hair looks fuller than usual, it&#x27;s not flyaway and the colour I paid for looks revived.&lt;br /&gt;Ignore, ignore, ignore the negative reviews!  Oh, because my hair is short, I didn&#x27;t use 10 - 12 pumps, I used 3.  Remember years ago, shampoo bottles always told us to \\&quot;rinse and repeat\\&quot; - well that was just to sell more product, I&#x27;m sure.  You may need 10 - 12 pumps if you have long, long hair but use your brains and only pump out what you need for your particular hair length.</li>
    <li> I love it! What others are saying about needing to use more than the directions say is true. I have long hair down to my waist and if I only used the 10-12 pumps recommended on the bottle, I would only get about half of my hair clean. I use about 6 pumps for each side of my head, 6 for the top, and another 6-10 for the length. Massage well into the roots and strands, comb it through and let it rest for about 5 minutes while you wash your body or shave. Rinse thoroughly and voila! Soft, clean, healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;ve noticed since starting to use Renpure is that my hair doesn&#x27;t get as oily between washings like it used to, which surprised me! So, even though I use more product when washing my hair with Renpure than I did when I shampooed it, I also don&#x27;t have to wash it as often, so it breaks about even cost wise. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter to try as a cheaper replacement for Wen. It&#x27;s thinner and weighs your hair down more than Wen. Definitely not a replacement for it.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL ... CANNOT SAY ENOUGH POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT IT - PERIOD! LOVE IT. ONE VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER HERE. I RECOMMEND THIS HIGHLY.</li>
    <li> I was trying to save money and I wasted mine!  I normally buy Wen and saw this and though wow it looks like my Wen and sounds like my Wen but guess what it&#x27;s NOT!  It leaves your hair dry and needing conditioner (thank god I still has some Wen left because I needed it)!  It does not do what the bottle says no matter how many pumps you use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, it&#x27;s nothing like Wen so guess what I just re-ordered? The real deal, Wen!</li>
    <li> I am a huge Wen fan, so when I saw this at my local drug store I was so excited. I bought it and used it the next day. As I started putting it in my hair I could feel how oily it was but I massaged  it in my hair. I left it on recommended time and starting rinsing it out. But no matter how long I rinsed it for I didn&#x27;t feel like it was coming out. I dried my hair and it felt terrible and weighed down. I tried to use it a few more times, each time trying a different approach but it never felt good. This is a terrible substitute for wen. I took it back and started using Salon grafix conditioning cleanser. It&#x27;s Awesome! Its exactly like wen. I would not recommend this to anyone. Thanks</li>
    <li> The smell was nice, my hair was shiny, but my scalp started breaking out, so I must be sensitive to one of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I thought I would give this a try as I do Love WEN. However, It is not as thick as WEN. I have Irish thick, medium length hair. It took 30 pumps to cover and had a mint sent.</li>
    <li> Love the idea of a clensing conditioner, makes my scalp tingle, and the scent is nice. The cons: doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair and makes my hair feel like there is a film on it.</li>
    <li> I took a risk on this product. My son and I both have straight hair and somewhat oily scalps. I have been looking to get away from not just SLS but all chemicals so I gave this a try hoping that foaming detergents that strip all your natural oils an acid mantel are an antiquated form of cleaning and that this would be the answer. It is! Our hair looks good, feels good, smells good, styles just fine, seems clean!&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY happy to throw away shampoo and switch to this. Doesn&#x27;t take as much as the instructions suggest if you don&#x27;t have super thick, long hair.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a generic of WEN, but was very let down.  I had to use twice as much product just to work it through my hair.  Even then my hair was left tangled and hard to comb through.  It made my hair feel dry and heavy all day.  I would not recommend this product, especially for WEN users.  It does not even come close.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review of a product before, but feel that I need to for this item. I previously had been using the Renpure Shampoo and Conditioner (red bottles), which I love. A friend then gave me the new WEN conditioner to try. I also liked this, but as we all know, its not cheap. I could not justify shelling out 30 clams per bottle. I went back to Walgreens recently to start back on my beloved shampoo/conditioner, only to find this new product, as a possible alternative to WEN. I was thrilled,as I had such great success with their other products. I smelled it, smelled great. I washed my hair. The conditioner felt thinner to me. After I got out, towel dried my hair, my hair STILL felt oily. I blew it dry....STILL felt oily. Went through Day 1 of trying this product with oily hair. So, I said, let me try it again. Day 2... no better.  I am so very disappointed in this product. It did not work well for me AT ALL. I do not recommend it as an alternative to WEN. I am going back to my original Renpure Organics (red bottles), which work great for me and are reasonably priced. Only problem is that I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in my local Walgreens. I hope they aren&#x27;t phasing it out to be replaced with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to like this product... but I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVOID......</li>
    <li> Works really well and now I will only use these types of shampoos!</li>
    <li> Works great.... does wonders to my super dry hair</li>
    <li> I got the Renpure Rosemary Mint cleaning conditioner thinking I was getting the other one.  When I got home I found out it wasn&#x27;t but used it anyway.  My natural black and some gray hair is dry and kinky.  I alway use conditioner and other products to keep the frizz down, I wear my hair in two-strand twists and when IT untwist my hair it will bush up.  The minute I put the Renpure in my hair it started to smooth out (I have  4 c hair) after rinsing my hair got softer and smoother. Drying my uair was a snap and it didn&#x27;t tangle, it was so soft  and it wasn&#x27;t  bushy .  I love this stuff it is great.  I&#x27;m going out and buy 4 bottles, great stuff.</li>
    <li> Five stars for this amazing stuff because it is the first hair product of any kind (cleanser, leave-ins, creams, serums, etc.) that makes my very thick, very coarse, 2C wavy hair smooth and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently have been enlightened to the destructive effects of SLS and SLES in cleansing products, and decided that, just maybe, these sulfates were keeping my hair from behaving. So I spent hours researching alternative shampoos and all the ingredients that /they/ used, and was disappointed to find that most alternatives still contain damaging surfactants that just go by different names. The answer, it seemed, was a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came down to a few different non-lathering cleansers, and I ended up with this one because it is the most reasonably priced. The first time I used it, I followed the instructions on the bottle; I used 12 pumps for my insanely abundant chin-length hair, which seemed to be the perfect amount. I left in on for about five minutes, and my hair felt neither like I was rinsing out a traditional conditioner, nor like straw; it felt clean, but hydrated. After towel-drying, I used about a pea-sized amount for leave-in condtioner, and no other product (I normally use a hair-smoothing serum). My hair dried a little faster than it does after using a traditional shampoo/conditioner, and it dried smooth, shiny, and so soft. (I feel so badly for all the reviewers whose hair DID feel like straw after using this, because it seems that, for the people it does work for, it works miracles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured any cleanser can work well once, so I wasn&#x27;t immediately convinced, but subsequent washes have yielded the same amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, the price is nice, and, most importantly, it makes my hair look and feel nice.</li>
    <li> UPDATING: so i believe i made a comment on here before. i used this for 2 months now....it did cleanse my hair but i had like dandruff buildup. it was gross cause you can&#x27;t really scrub your head with this stuff like with shampoo. but i&#x27;ve gotta admit if your coloring your hair and shampoo washes out your hair color (from box or dyed from a hair salon). this is good for it. maybe im not using it right? although its a pretty small bottle its gone in like 4 weeks. so i might still use it for a leave in conditioner but not in my scalp. more for the ends of my hair you know? P.S. if you dont want to order this online you can find this in walgreens.</li>
    <li> First, I have to say that I&#x27;ve never written a product review before, but this product is so terrible that I am shocked--SHOCKED--at the good reviews on this product before mine.  I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about a year now and fell absolutely in love with almost everything about it.  My hair is silky, manageable, and healthy because of it...there&#x27;s just one problem--the price.  So when I found Ren, and saw the good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I was so excited to get it and I wanted to like it so bad, but the similarities of this product stop after the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it the first time and my hair felt dirty and very heavy after my shower.  It was hard to get a brush through it and I still had to used a separate leave-in to detangle.  The next morning, I had to use a dry shampoo to take care of the oil build up in my hair.  I can usually go three days between washes on my hair, so this was a red flag to have oil after one day.  I decided to give it another try though, just to get a thorough evaluation of it.  After my second wash, my hair felt even more heavy and, quite frankly, disgusting than it did the first time around.  After blow drying, I realized why.  The product isn&#x27;t cleaning my hair at all!  Immediately after blow drying, my hair already had excessive oil in it--so much so that my hair had that stringy/clumpy look that happens when someone goes far too long between washes.  You could see large portions of my scalp where my hair had clumped together from the oil.  I was furious!  I&#x27;ve never had to use dry shampoo immediately after showering before, but I did with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I am shocked at the positive reviews of this product.  I researched the product some more, to make sure that I am using it correctly, and it appears I am.  I followed the directions exactly both times, and everything online says that this product it to be used like Wen, as a cleansing conditioner, without the use of shampoo.  That said, I have absolutely no idea how this product worked for the people before me.  It almost makes me think the reviews came from people connected to the company that makes it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a prime example of the age-old adage, you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;m switching back to Wen--it may be more expensive, but I can go three days between washes and I don&#x27;t need to use additional shampoo or leave-in, so the price balances out!</li>
    <li> I have been using Hair one for over a year and I like how it works. I really enjoy only using one product in the shower. I do not miss using separate shampoo and conditioner. I have long, normal, fine hair that I wash every day. I have been looking for other cleansing conditioner options besides Wen and found Ren so I bought a bottle. After the first wash my hair felt \\&quot;different\\&quot;. It felt like I had lots of root lift, similar to the feeling I get at the end of the day when I use too much hairspray. Its difficult to describe but my scalp did not feel normal. By the third use my hair felt like I had been sick and in bed for a week. It had volume and root lift but it looked and felt greasy. Even my boyfriend made a comment about how my hair looked greasy. I washed with shampoo and conditioner and my hair returned to normal. Ren Cleansing Conditioner, Sweet Pomegranate was a total waste of money and I threw out the bottle after 3 washes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried wen before but I really want to, although the price is too high! So I researched a few cleansing conditioners to see which one was similar to wen and after looking at all the good reviews on ren I decided to buy it and give it a try. Very bad idea, my hair felt dirty, very tangled and extremely frizzy since I have wavy hair it made it worse than it already is. Not even a regular shampoo from walmart does this to my hair. Well at least I gave it a try and realized what a terrible product it is, maybe the only good thing about this thing is the scent but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my hair and it just wasn&#x27;t soaking in my hair like Wen does; it felt really tangled, so I went back to using Wen.  However, I gave it to my friend to try and she LOVES it!  Her hair looks and feels great.  If you are on the fence about trying it, just do it - it&#x27;s only $9.99 and it might work!</li>
    <li> Fine - not as good as Wen, but ok.&lt;br /&gt;Didnt condition as much- i have thick curly hair</li>
    <li> I think i was allergic to this one.</li>
    <li> If you are look for a dupe of Wen, this is a poor substitute. It is thin, and not terribly conditioning. But the seller sent quickly and well packaged and does smell nice.  I use it my bath water, as a skin conditioner.</li>
    <li> I grew up in the salon watching my mother do hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very very thick naturally curly hair that is probably 20% grey, under my color.  This is amazing.  My hair has zero frizz.  It is amazing.  People are coming up to me all over to tell me how great it looks.  For ten dollars, isn&#x27;t it worth the risk!  I boxed up all of my other products to give away.  I have NEVER been blown away by a product....but I was with this! Try it!</li>
    <li> I read most of the reviews for this product after I had already purchased it.. Lol. And then I became nervous to try it. But I&#x27;m on a mission to try and be as chemical free as I can, so I tried it anyhow. First, my hair is curly.. Medium in texture.. And long. The first time I tried it my hair was on day 2 of no washing, so it was pretty greasy, which made me more nervous! I was sure my hair was going to be a pitiful mess!! lol. Nope! Not at all. As a matter of fact, I&#x27;m sitting here typing this on day 2 of no wash, where usually my hair would be so greasy.. And it&#x27;s not at all greasy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think where most people are going wrong with this product is they aren&#x27;t applying it properly. Just my opinion. I massage it into my scalp really well.. Add a tad bit of water, and massage more.. Let it sit while I wash my body, and massage it while I rinse. You can&#x27;t just apply it, let it sit, and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product. My hair has NEVER been able to not be washed every day, and not be greasy.. Or not be pulled up in a sloppy bun. Lol. Totally give it try. I think Walgreens still has it buy one get one free. I may go back for more. ;)</li>
    <li> I tried to take the cheaper option and look for something that compares to WEN, and there is not product that does,so I went back to WEN. I love the way Wen smells, feels, and etc.  Renpure is ok, but it is really thick and if not washed out well, it leaves residue on your hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at my local Walgreens on a whim because my Korean shampoo/conditioner is a little over budget for me at the moment, but I love this product so much I will give it a permanent place in my rotation for as long as they make it (and I hope they always make it).  One side note, the ingredients on the bottle I purchased at Walgreens DO match the description here (coconut oil as the 2nd ingredient) so perhaps some of the negative reviews received a knock-off formula.  I have also never used Wen products, but I don&#x27;t believe this is some sort of knock-off of theirs.  Renpure has been around for many years and I&#x27;ve loved their other products (shampoo, conditioner, etc) in the past.  In fact, I purchased this product because it looked interesting and because I trust this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In using this, I followed the directions on the bottle, though I probably used more than the recommended amount of pumps (3 pump increments, working it into different sections).  I work this into my hair making sure to rake my fingers through and cover the roots, splashing a bit of water to smooth it on easier.  At this point, the product doesn&#x27;t really have much slip, but I let it soak in while I do the rest of my shower routine, then rinse thoroughly when it starts to feel smooth and slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing, my hair feels clean and moves like it does after a traditional shampoo and conditioner, but more moisturized so I don&#x27;t even have to use a leave-in conditioner.  I am mixed (Korean and white) with very thick, mostly straight hair with a bit of wave.  My hair tends to get big and frizzy with greasy roots and dry ends on a lot of drug store brands, but this kept my hair soft, smooth, and balanced with a lovely scent.  Even my bangs are clean and soft afterwards and don&#x27;t get greasy or separate all day (pretty awesome since I make my living running around waiting tables).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this product exceeded my expectations on all fronts:&lt;br /&gt;-Did a great job cleaning and balancing my hair (refreshing feel I can run my fingers through, no greasy separation)&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturized and smoothed my hair (didn&#x27;t even need leave-in)&lt;br /&gt;-Lovely scent (sweet pomegranate with just a hint of minty-ness)&lt;br /&gt;-Good price (I paid about $10 and this ACTUALLY does the work of both shampoo and conditioner for me)</li>
    <li> I have tried Ren only once so far but I can tell you one of the things I was told about this product(after my experience using the product) is that you must rinse, rinse, rinse. If you think you rinsed enough, rinse some more. So there is a lot of time and water using this product.&lt;br /&gt;My experience using this product is first of all I was totally turned off about the smell. To me it reeked big time! I could hardly wait to get the whole thing over with just to get this stinky stuff off my hair!! It just about took my breath away but I kept going as I wanted to see how my hair would turn out. Once your done massaging into your hair and scalp you feel a tingling sensation so it feels like its working, then when your rinsing you can feel the difference in your hair, to me it felt a lot stronger and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product, I went to comb out my wet hair and like the others on here i couldn&#x27;t get the comb thru it. It was like It was never conditioned. It was all snarled and ratty. I had to go back to the sink and put my regular conditioner on it to get the comb thru it. After I blow dried my hair it felt heavy and a bit dirty, but maybe that was because I didn&#x27;t rinse like I later found out.&lt;br /&gt;The only one thing I found I did like and felt was an improvement was my hair did feel stronger. Even though I felt I had a bad experience, I am not ready to give up on the product just yet. I am going to give it a few more tries to see if there is any dramatic results.</li>
    <li> I used Wen for 2 1/2 years and fell in love with it as I was able to FINALLY grow my hair out..and it looks lush and thicker than ever before. I must say that I have always hoped the prices would lower or there would be an alternative soon. I have tried several which I didn&#x27;t particularly care for enough to make the switch. Until Renpure. It is less than half the price and apples to apples...I would give it a 4 compared to a 5 for Wen. The only thing that I notice is that it is a bit less comb-able after cleansing....but not that bad. I am tempted to perhaps combine the two and reduce my costs that way. Nevertheless I find this to be a very good alternative to the much pricier brand name. Nice fresh clean fragrance as well. Not at all perfumed.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product.  I purchased it without ever trying a product like Wen.  I have fine hair but lots of it, and it is naturally curly.  This product was great when I just wanted to leave my hair curly, but I typically don&#x27;t wash my hair every day because I don&#x27;t normally get oily hair.  This product smelled awesome, but it made me have to wash my hair everyday, although it would air-dry into bouncy, soft curls.  If I wanted to straighten it, it would be a greasy mess underneath the top half of my hair.  This product would be great for someone who needs air-dried defined curls, has dry hair that needs to wet it down or wash it every day, and wears their hair in a way that they don&#x27;t want a lot of maintenance.  You won&#x27;t need any additional product if you wear your hair air-dried.  I am giving it to my Mom, who has extremely long and tight Italian curly hair.  I think her type of hair is perfect for this product.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen, Hair One, and now Ren.I have also blended my own with non-sulphate conditioners. It has been almost 2 years since i used shampoo. I think hair type matters with each of these products. I think you also have to adjust the amount you rinse out with each of them, or at least with my hair type I did. When I made my own I adjusted the thickness to what I like by adding distilled water. I definitely feel the Ren is the thickest of the 3 mentioned. BUT, I was very disappointed to find that the price on Amazon is actually higher than what I can get it at locally. I am in the Brattleboro VT area. I come to Amazon for literally everything as it is always cheaper but this is not the case!</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair that tends toward oiliness without shampooing at least every other day. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try WEN for a long time, but don&#x27;t have the thirty bucks to plunk down on something I&#x27;m not certain of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw Ren in the drugstore today and figured, for ten bucks, I&#x27;d give it a shot. I can always return it if I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was great in the shower; smells wonderful and was easy to apply. Immediately after the shower, I noted how quickly my hair was drying and that was a plus, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once it had dried, the hair at my roots was very heavy and oily. I got back in the shower and re-rinsed, very well, thinking that maybe I hadn&#x27;t gotten enough of the product out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My roots did get marginally better on that second rinse, however, they were still oily and the rest of my hair looked pretty fried. My fine, straight hair was frizzy and more unmanageable than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be bringing Ren back to the drugstore and swapping it for [[ASIN:B005I0JWGK Renpure Originals Argan Oil Shampoo, 16 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] and [[ASIN:B005I0JWEM Renpure Organics Argan Oil Conditioner, 16 Ounce (Pack of 2)]], which I&#x27;ve used for a long time and absolutely love.</li>
    <li> Overall I think this is a nice product, just not sure it was right for my hair type.  It smells wonderful.  I noticed on days I use it my hair is softer and more managable than usual.  My issue with the product is that if I use it daily my hair looks very oily at the roots, as if I haven&#x27;t washed it.  My soultion is that I use the product for a few days and then wash with regular shampoo once or twice a week.  I also skip the root area sometimes to help prevent this. The product works nicely though if you follow directions.  And you must be sure to rinse very thoroughly or you&#x27;ll get the oily look also.  Oh, almost forgot, another positive i personally noticed was less shedding of my hair.  My hair sheds insanely, and this product did seem to cut that back signifigantly.  I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> u get what u pay for awfull stuff wen has nothing to worry about ill stick with wen save your money u hair stll feels dirty really gross stuff</li>
    <li> not a big money saver, defiantly not wen, yes it got my hair clean but you have to use 2 -3 times more than wen ,it also doesn&#x27;t have the detangling properties of wen and it leaves my hair  with fly aways and static definitely not a money saver</li>
    <li> This is definitely not Wen. It&#x27;s much thinner and therefore a little more difficult to use. That being said, it smells great and seems to still do the same job overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for years and love it.  I was hopeful that I&#x27;d found a less expensive alternative with this product.  Although it smells pretty nice, it is a weird combination of making your hair feel dried out when it&#x27;s wet but then when it dries, it looks oily.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.  It also takes like a hundred pumps to actually be able to cover my hair, so I ended up using up a ton of product to boot, so not so effective in the cost savings department.  Overall, I was hopeful but the product just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, but is not a substitute for Wen. Like so many reviewers I find the cost for Wen out of my budget, so looking for a more cost effective product. This product has a pleasant aroma. Bottom line: it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft, manageable and shiny as Wen, but I will use it up!</li>
    <li> I began using Renpure about a year ago. Although I will admit that there was a learning curve, during which I had a) anxiety issues over the fact that it, unlike shampoo, does NOT foam and b) for some reason the Rosemary Mint variety did not cut it for me, once I learned how to use it and tried the Sweet Pomegranite variety, I was HOOKED!&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse, wavy, thick, full hair that I&#x27;ve been coloring for almost 30 years straight. I&#x27;m not a daily hair washer (no point in scrubbing the color out of my hair after paying all that money to have someone put it IN, right??). I also don&#x27;t like to mess around with multiple hair product which makes the process of &#x27;doing my hair&#x27; an all - morning affair :)&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this product - my hair is shiny, soft, blow dries and straightens beautifully, stays clean for up to 3 days, and less is coming out in the brush overall. Before Renpure I used shampoo and conditioner in the shower, then needed to add Argan oil as a leave in before drying - now, I just wash well with Renpure, taking particular care to begin by completely applying to my scalp first, then massaging downward, using the last pump or two on the ends and to coat the shaft, shower and shave as normal, then rinse THOROUGHLY (cannot stress this enough - failure to do so can cause oily feel when dry or the flaky build-up others have described), then towel dry and style as usual. In my opinion, this whole procedure takes no more time than if I were to be using my former method of lathering with shampoo, rinsing, conditioning, rinsing again, and applying the leave-in before being able to go about my business. So - what are you waiting for???? Try it NOW!! :)&lt;br /&gt;A word to the wise on pricing - those of us who are fortunate enough to have a local Rite Aid store can purchase it there for $9.99. Once you fall in love with it, take a brief moment to check the Rite Aid circular weekly, or take a quick detour down the hair products aisle when you&#x27;re in the store - often there is a BOGO on this product and I usually end up getting it for $5 each.</li>
    <li> I am African American that is transitioning for about 10 months.  I follow the Curly Girl method to maintain my hair.  I saw this product in Walgreens and was hesitant to use it because I never heard of it.  I went home and did research.  I went back to Walgreens about 6 weeks later and saw this on sale 2 for 1 so I picked up two bottles to try and still reluctant.  I tried once and this is great so far I consider it a keeper dare I say potential staple product!  Some people complain of it being greasy but everything is not for everyone for example shampoo is too drying for me.  There are a lot of good ingredients such as coconut oil etc.  No sulfates and no lather it does as it says clean my hair while leaving it soft.  I tried another popular co washing product in a brown jar that smell like coconut but I like this product better.  It left my hair cleaner and softer and if your one that&#x27;s not influenced by the hype perhaps you will too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is runny and leaves my hair sticky and almost  crusty...I do not like it</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen on my naturally thick, dry, curly hair for several months and loved the results, but hated the price. My mom (who has similar hair) recommended this product, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Honestly, I think it works even better than Wen! My hair is shiny and manageable. I would recommend using more than the 10-12 pumps recommended on the packaging - I would say closer to 30 pumps - and make sure you comb it through before rinsing your hair. I have seen several negative comments about the scent, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad at all. Plus, it works so well, I would use it even if I thought it was a bad scent. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this morning at my local Rite Aide. OMG is what to say!! Awesome product. I love it already and have only used it once. Smells wonderful, refreshing and clean smell, not perfumy. My hair is/was damaged to lots of coloring and bleaching. I had to put pretty aggressive chopped layers in my hair to help with the damage but it is still there. I followed the directions to the letter. As I was waiting the 3-5 minutes leaving it in I started reading the reviews. I started with the 1 stars and got pretty worried while reading and waiting. Terrible things said so of course when it came down to the rinse out I was in panic mode. My hair did feel like straw at first but as soon as I combed it out and started to blow dry it I was pleasantly surprised. My hair felt oh so very soft and smooth and that was with blow drying. Used a straightener and wow again. Usually it takes a couple of passes with my straightener but only one pass this time. I went outside for the \\&quot;sun\\&quot; test to see the shine. My hair hasn&#x27;t shined like this in I don&#x27;t know how long. Overall I am very pleased with Ren and will totally buy again. I can&#x27;t wait to get to wash it again.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling like it had a residue on it also it smelled funny.  It is not WEN and shouldn&#x27;t even be compared to it</li>
    <li> Okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of this writing, this product is averaging about 3 stars, and while it&#x27;s hands-down the absolute BEST product I have EVER used on my hair, I understand why.  You&#x27;ll notice that there are a ton of 5-star reviews and a ton of 1-star reviews, and that&#x27;s always a big red flag for me when I&#x27;m reading reviews.  I&#x27;m going to try to address some of the concerns I read about from the 1-star reviews.  (I&#x27;ve also left a similar review on the Walgreens site, but I promise I&#x27;m not a bot.  I also waited a few weeks between reviews so I could post pics and stuff onto my Amazon review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, mostly straight-ish, fine hair (though there&#x27;s LOTS of it).  My hair has been color treated multiple times.  The first time I used Renpure I was horrified to see that I had the oily clumping problem described by a lot of other reviewers.  More than that, it was almost impossible to brush through, my hair felt like nasty oily straw as I was rinsing it out, and I hated the smell.  So I was pretty much ready to chuck this thing in the garbage.  However, I read a lot of different tips on various sites, realized what I was doing wrong, and decided to give it one more try.  The difference was night and day!  Prior to using Renpure I was really trying to cut back on the shampooing, (see above mention of color-treated hair) and was able to get away with washing every other day with liberal use of dry shampoo.  Now, I kid you not, my hair looks as healthy if not more so on days 2 and 3 as it does on day 1, and that&#x27;s pretty healthy.  So with that background, let me tell you the tips that I read that took this product from something awful into something that I adore.  I recognize that these might not work for everybody, but they definitely worked great for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Use more than the directions tell you to use.  No wait, more than that.  Now more than THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renpure tells you on the bottle to use 10-12 pumps.  It&#x27;s lies.  When I looked up other cleansing conditioning companies I found that many of them suggested using 48(!) pumps PER USE.  I have a system down now, but I use six pumps at the front of my scalp, six pumps on each side by my ears, six pumps at the nape of my neck, and then about 4 pumps at the top back of my head.  The savvy reader will note that this adds up to MORE THAN DOUBLE Renpure&#x27;s recommended use.  Why is that?  Well, when it comes to cleansing conditioners, you need to use more.  I didn&#x27;t want to put a huge amount on my head because I was worried that was making it greasy.  And guess what?  When I used the suggested amount, it WAS.  But the solution was to use WAY more, not less or even a few pumps more.  The next step about massaging it into your scalp is accurate, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Comb it through&lt;br /&gt;Get a fat-toothed comb to have on hand in the shower, because this conditioner doesn&#x27;t have much in the way of slip.  It probably takes me 3-4 minutes to get the product combed through my hair from my scalp, and it&#x27;s only after that that I start counting the time.  Renpure tells you to wait 3-5 minutes total once you&#x27;ve got the stuff massaged into your scalp.  I think it usually sits in mine for about ten.  Basically, go onto YouTube and check out the instructional video for WEN, and pretend that the directions on the back of the Renpure bottle don&#x27;t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Rinse forever&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, like 2-3 minutes of rinsing.  At the time that I start to rinse I&#x27;m just starting to think, \\&quot;Boy, my hair sure feels slick and conditioned!\\&quot;  About halfway through rinsing it feels awful, like the oily straw I described.  And if I&#x27;m honest, my hair feels pretty poor (when compared to how it&#x27;s felt after other conditioners) until I start blowing it dry.  That&#x27;s when the magic happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Give it time&lt;br /&gt;Your hair is used to needing to produce a lot of oil to compete with shampoos that strip it every time you use it.  It will take it some time to adjust.  Even aftermy first successful use, I found that I couldn&#x27;t go more than 24 hours between washes.  After a week, I could do 2 days.  Now I can handle 3 without any trouble.  Honestly, I get as many compliments on my day 3 hair as my day 1 hair, so I&#x27;m going to upload a picture of me with day 3 hair so you have an idea how that looks.  But it took me about two weeks of use to get to this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The smell still sucks&lt;br /&gt;Some people here like it--I really don&#x27;t.  At all.  I would deduct a star if I weren&#x27;t so darn happy with the results.  But in the interest of full disclosure, there you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s been my experience so far with Renpure.  I am extremely happy with it so far.  I&#x27;ve switched entirely from using other shampoos and conditioners and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.

    <li> After dying my hair red I decided I needed to find an awesome way to take care of it that didn&#x27;t involve shampoo. I have always been interested in &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34; ways of doing things and the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; movement. What wasn&#x27;t working with those hopes, though, is that my hair is oily and fine. I shower daily and wash my hair daily or I feel disgusting. That&#x27;s when I started reading up on conditioner only hair care and cleansing conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also about my hair: it is fairly thick but very fine, straight as a board, won&#x27;t hold much shape unless I use 7 lbs of products, and once it gets fairly long it falls limp within about 20 minutes of blow drying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried Wen and doubt I ever will unless there is a MAJOR sale going on. The alternatives in my area seemed to be Hair One (from a &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; store) and Ren (from a drug store). I got both (Hair One Jojoba and Ren pomegranate) and have been pleased. I have outlined what I like and don&#x27;t like about each below but please keep in mind the results depend on YOUR individual hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR ONE JOJOBA&lt;br /&gt;This is very thick and feels very moisturizing. The smell isn&#x27;t great but it&#x27;s not bad either. I don&#x27;t really follow the recommended amount of pumps anymore (I use about 3 to the front and 3 to the back) but I&#x27;m sure the amount needed varies per person and hair type. The key to using this? RINSE, RINSE, and RINSE SOME MORE. Cannot stress it enough. After rinsing my hair feels kind of weird...almost too clean and not silky at all. After drying it, though, it feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REN PURE&lt;br /&gt;This one has a pretty nice smell to it. I have yet to try the minty one. It is thinner and rinsed out a lot easier. It isn&#x27;t as thick so sometimes I have to use a bit more if some falls out of my hair or hand in the shower. It makes my hair feel clean as well and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both seem to let my color last a pretty long time (I don&#x27;t color because the color seems faded I do it because roots are showing). I don&#x27;t know if they have really improved with my hair keeping shape as I rarely (like maybe 3-4 times a year) every try to curl it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like both as each has it&#x27;s own perks and pitfalls. I think Hair One makes my hair feel more clean (not that Ren doesn&#x27;t but Hair One seems to have a little edge) but Ren doesn&#x27;t mean I have to rinse my hair for the entirety of Free Bird (or that&#x27;s how long it feels). I currently have both in my home because I have caught both brands on sale and will likely continue to use both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final perk to both is the look you get when you tell someone you haven&#x27;t used shampoo for months. Priceless.</li>
    <li> I had used \\&quot;Hair One\\&quot; cleansing conditioner before and after using it a while it had built up residue in my hair and made my hair lifeless. It took about 2-3 washings of regular shampoo to wash out the residue and bring the bouncy back in my hair. I had always wanted to try \\&quot;Wen,\\&quot; but the price deterred me. I had also read unfavorable reviews on Wen and didn&#x27;t want to take a risk -money wise- on a product that had a good chance of disappointing me. So I saw this cheaper alternative at the drugstore and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used \\&quot;Ren\\&quot; four times and for me personally, I don&#x27;t follow the directions. I use the amount as necessary. I only pump as \\&quot;needed\\&quot; to get enough cleanser massaged and spread throughout my scalp and hair. I also don&#x27;t leave it in too long as directed; not only does it take longer to rinse, but it makes my hair heavy and oily. When I rinse...I really RINSE. Rinsing thoroughly will avoid greasy heavy hair. Since I rise so thoroughly and do not add Ren in my hair as a detangler, my hair is tangled and feels dry. So I do add a detangler product (non-Renpure product) to my hair to get a brush through it. Kind of defeats the purpose of using a cleanser conditioner if I have to add the very products this stuff is suppose to rid our hair of and to replenish the natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly to wavy hair and I let it air-dry as I scrunch it with a curly crème product. Unfortunately, when I use this cleanser, my hair isn&#x27;t as curly and what curls I do have don&#x27;t hold. By the end of the day I have wavy to stringy hair. My curls and Ren just don&#x27;t mesh. Now that&#x27;s just me...some people here would tell you it makes their hair curlier, which goes to show not all hair is created equal. For me, if I was wearing my hair down and styling it, I would not use this product, but for a quick shampoo without styling, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product depends on the individual&#x27;s hair. Some people love it and it works well for them andfor others it was a disaster. For me, I&#x27;m in the middle. It&#x27;s an \\&quot;okay\\&quot; product, but I still have to use other products to help it along. It was worth trying. I&#x27;ll finish this bottle I bought and use it every other washing or when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to shampoo/condition. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy Ren again, but may take the plunge and finally try Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how this product is compared to Wen, but it is better than Hair One in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this product knowing how wen works. I have used wen many times in the past, but didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for shampoo that often. I used this product and my hair felt disgusting! I thought maybe it was because i haven&#x27;t used it in so long, NOPE! I used it again, and my hair is heavy and greasy feeling. This is NOTHING like WEN. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. Wen is $20 more because it actually works. WORST PURCHASE EVER!</li>
    <li> I cannot afford to purchase Wen on a regular basis and regular shampoo makes my hair brittle. I am trying the Curly Girl method but my hair needs more than just water and friction sometimes so I looked into Wen alternatives and found Ren and two other brands. The other two brands left my hair dry but Ren makes my hair feel silky! I read some of the negative reviews and think that their hair is naturally oily. If your hair is naturally curly (even tight, afro curls), dry and breaks easily then this product will work well for you. If you have very dry, tight curls you will still need to use a light, leave-in conditioner but your hair will feel soft and it will be easier to comb and style. Once you stop using conventional shampoo and start using Ren you will notice an amazing difference over time. I highly recommend this product and love how it makes my hair look and feel!</li>
    <li> Same as one of the other posts...I don&#x27;t ever write reviews but I just got out of the shower and went immediately to the computer - it&#x27;s that bad!  I used wen for about 2 years and loved it!  Switched to hair one (sally beauty) to save money.  Just saw this one today at Rite aid and it&#x27;s a little cheaper (9.99) in store...will be promptly returning it later today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum:  took me about 3x the amount of pumps compared to wen, 2x compared to hair one.  Very water based with a heavy accent on an oil that left my hair feeling greasy thus - I don&#x27;t feel anywhere near as clean in my hair today as I would with hair one brand.  While the smell was pleasant at first...it has that &#x27;aftersmell&#x27; you get when they sent childrens&#x27; toys...kind of that sick sweet smell that drives you nuts after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets face it.....nobody can beat Wen....especially not REN!</li>
    <li> Not as good as Wen products, but decent</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a substitue for pricey WEN. Sadly, it&#x27;s not for me. Following the directions on the package left me with greasy roots and dried out ends. I then tried using as many pumps as WEN instructs you to use but got the same unsatisfactory results. Ren smells really nice but it&#x27;s not quite as thick and it doesn&#x27;t feel as rich and creamy as WEN does even when you add a little splash of water on your head when you massage your scalp.  I am gonna finish up the bottle using it to moisturize my legs for shaving. Big time bummer. Was hoping to save $$$. I&#x27;ll keep looking...</li>
    <li> Yeah, so i went ahead and bought this hoping I would get shiny, clean, manageable, frizz free hair.  Nope, that is not the case.  If anything, this product doesn&#x27;t clean at all, but just leaves your hair clumpy and heavy. It&#x27;s like the stuff doesn&#x27;t wash out.  The spouse said, your hair still looked dirty. Well, wont be buying this nor recommending it either.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen for 4 years. I love Wen and it was worth every penny but very expensive like others are saying. I purchased Ren and while using it I noticed that it was hard to run my fingers through my hair and when I rinsed I expected silky feeling hair but it wasn&#x27;t silky at all! At this point I was sceptical.. I&#x27;m like okay, I will just blow dry and see what happens. Boy was I shocked!! I have long color treated hair and was AMAZED by the results!! Very soft and managable, my hair curled with the curling iron just like it does with Wen and the next day I could brush through it with no tangles. If it continues to work this way then I&#x27;m not going back to Wen and will be happy about saving 3 x the money. My fingers are crossed</li>
    <li> After using WEN for the past few years, I must say that this is not what I had hoped it would be.  You still need to use just as many pumps, if not more.  For medium to longer hair, I use 20 pumps, normally only 12 of WEN.  It is a very runny product, not nearly as solid as WEN.  The smell however, a lot better than WEN and seems to stick around a little longer for those of us that don&#x27;t wash our hair every day.  It is a nice attempt on replicating WEN, and with a few improvements I hope that they continue to stay a decent competitor.  As of now, I will have to use up the rest of the product and return to WEN.</li>
    <li> Even though I bought this product locally I wanted to leave a review because after reading so many negative ones I want people to know&lt;br /&gt;for some this can be a fantastic hair cleanser.  With out stripping my colored hair it cleanses it perfectly with out drying it out or leaving it greasy.  I pretty much rinse it out right after running it through my hair.  I do not use any hair products with silicone though so that could&lt;br /&gt;make a difference in how this works for me.  I love how much less expensive this is then Wen (way over priced) and that I can buy it locally.</li>
    <li> I used Wen before and was anxious to get this to use. Unfortunately I developed a rash around my face and on my neck and scalp.  I love cleansing conditioners and they make my hair look wonderful. Sorry I won&#x27;t be able to use this product. I would have given 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Ignore the directions on the bottle...they are useless. I have very long (lower back length), thick, coarse, colored, dry, easily frizzed, curly/wavy unmanageable hair.  Basically a nightmare to care for, but it&#x27;s a labor of love and I&#x27;m very picky about it. I had been using Wen for months, and the cost was piling up simply because I needed to use a ton of it. The thought of shelling out another $38 for pomegranate Wen, which incidentally smells absolutely awful, was not very appealing. But I was at the end of the bottle and a replacement. I happened to see Ren on the shelf of a red bullseye store, and it was obviously a Wen knockoff. It wasn&#x27;t even *trying* to conceal it! But at $6.99, I thought it was worth a shot - though my expectations were admittedly low.    The first time I used it, I followed the directions on the bottle and my hair definitely had that \\&quot;oily straw\\&quot; feeling that many here have complained of. I was also surprised at the thin consistency, since wen is thicker than most of the conditioners I&#x27;ve tried. I assumed Ren would be similar. However, I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up just yet, so I read all of the reviews here in an effort to figure out what I was doing wrong. I tried it again yesterday, this time ignoring the bottle completely and using some of the tips from my fellow reviewers.  This is what I did:  1. Soak hair thoroughly with water, then squeeze out the water until it&#x27;s wet, but not dripping.  2. I flipped my head over and applied 6 pumps to the back of my hair and worked it down to the ends.  3. Flip hair back up, apply 6 pumps each to both sides of my head and work down to ends.  4. Comb through entire head with wide tooth comb to ensure the product is evenly distributed, then comb it all back (looks like when you get out of a pool and your hair is slicked back).  5. Since my hair tends to be most dry in the front and the top layers, I put 6 MORE pumps on top of my slicked back hair and combed THAT back and through my hair, making sure theends are well coated.  6. Then I worked it into my scalp with my fingertips. I did this for 2-3 minutes, and then put it in a bun for the rest of my shower to let the product sink in.  7. At the end of my shower, I worked the product into my scalp for another minute or two and then rinsed it out completely. When you think you&#x27;re done rinsing, give it another minute...trust me, it&#x27;s not rinsed enough.  8. Now I think this part was the key: once it was thoroughly rinsed, I lightly squeezed out my hair so that it was wet, but not dripping. I took 2 more pumps and worked it through my hair. I started about two inches from my scalp and combed it all the day down to the ends, making sure the ends are well coated.  I also allowed a bit to lightly coat the strands around my face, since my highlights make that area dry and a total pain to smooth.  9.DO NOT RINSE IT OUT!!!  I just put it all up in a towel, and when it was about 80% dry, I coated it with a small amount (size of a dime) of argan oil, again, 2 inches from my scalp, down to the ends, with a tiny bit in the front. I did this to lock in the Ren as a leave in conditioner.    Then the real test came - it usually takes me at least 15-20 minutes to blow dry my hair smooth. It&#x27;s a long, arduous process that I do about once a week, because of all the heat and constant pulling with my brush. This time, it took half the time and the brush slipped easily through my hair without pulling. My arms didn&#x27;t even have a chance to get tired! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I did run a flat iron lightly over the ends to shape them, but otherwise, my hair was smooth, shiny and soft with MUCH less effort. I want to note that my hair usually frizzes at the thought of humidity or rain, and we had a fizzy, rainy, humid day yesterday. I covered my hair with a hood while outside, but the front was somewhat exposed and it still didn&#x27;t frizz.  :D    Today is the second day, and my hair is still soft, shiny and smooth without doing a thing. It doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down at all, my scalp isn&#x27;t oily and the ends still look good. I think Ren could be a keeper. I&#x27;m going to try this protocol again in my next shower, and if the results are the same, I will be sticking with it. If not, I will update this review with an appropriately grumpy tirade about wasting time and money etc...etc.  Finally, I want to assure you that I am a real person, who is really picky about my hair, but sick of spending a fortune on products that I basically rinse down the drain. This was a probably the longest review I&#x27;ve written, but if you struggle with your hair like I do, and are sick of drying your hair until your arms are numb, perhaps this information can help make it a bit easier. Btw: I left off a star because 1) I want to see if I can achieve these results again, and 2) because of the thin, runny consistency. It takes effort to keep it from running out of my hands before I apply to my hair. But at this price, and with these results, I can live with that.</li>
    <li> I am a wen user for 2 years and love the product but not the cost.  I tried this for $10 and thought it would be great if it works at a 1/3 of the price.  I used ren tonight and yuck!  Nothing felt clean. It was like pouring coconut oil on wet hair. It was greasy, I couldn&#x27;t spread it and after scrubing for 2 minutes and leaving it in for 3, it was even worse.  You couldn&#x27;t wash the stuff out of your hair and I rinsed a lot. I thought maybe it would feel better and soak in after I blow dries.  My scalp is so heavy an greasy.  My hair is flat and there is no shine.  It looks gross.  I&#x27;m going to wash tomorrow with my Wen to get the gunk out of my hair and get the bounce and shine back.  Normally I wash every 3 days.  My hands even feel greasy after touching my hair</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t a big fan.  Didn&#x27;t seem to work any better, and in fact possibly worse than, regular store-bought products.  I did not even finish this bottle.  My husband wasn&#x27;t a fan of the scent either.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen (which I still like and use on a limited basis), but I found the price more than I can afford. REN is cheaper, available at my local drugstore so no shipping. REN works differently than WEN, but my incredibly fine hair and oversensitive skin felt great. My hair is super soft, fluffy, held the style all day, smells good and my head did not itch. Like WEN it is important to follow the directions.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser/conditioner. I&#x27;ve experimented over the last several months with different ways of cleaning my hair -- from the &amp;#34;No-&#x27;Poo&amp;#34; method to the baking soda/ACV regimen, to just cleaning it with conditioner. This is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s a little expensive for me to use every time, so maybe once a week I&#x27;ll massage some of this into my hair for a couple of minutes and rinse. The longer it stays in, the softer the hair gets. This cleans but does not strip the hair. I also love the fragrance -- subtle, but really lovely.</li>
    <li> Bought this at target and been using for two weeks.. Washing my hair every other day. I&#x27;ve had wonderful results. My hair is healthy, has great shine and isn&#x27;t oily at all. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> So about a couple months ago, I bought Wen just to try and see how it worked on my hair since I had read more positive reviews than not. I must say, it is a good product (although it is weird using a product that doesn&#x27;t lather).  I did have to use many pumps per use because my hair is past my shoulder.  When I logged back onto amazon, it was then that I an across Ren. Besides being more than half the price of Wen, it got to me really quickly. It smells better too I think. Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff! I have turned several people on to it already!</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my hair manageable and soft.Smells great , cleans well.</li>
    <li> If you love WEN...you&#x27;ll love RenPure! I used Wen and enjoyed the product but quite frankly couldn&#x27;t afford it each month! I tried some cheap store brand alternatives to no avail but then I came across this when shopping at VitaCost (it is about 10$ a bottle on that site with free shipping if your order is over 49$ which I easily can do when I add up items I wait to buy). This is a wonderful prodcut. I honestly look forward to washing my hair  knowing it will look and smell great afterwards:) I just pump about 6-8 pumps (my hair is medium length), massage for about a minute into hair/scalp and let sit for 2 minutes while I wash up and then I run a wide toothed comb thru before rinsing. That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly didn&#x27;t think cleansing conditioners would work for me b/c I don&#x27;t have thick/wavy/dry hair and actually have oily-medium fine hair but it makes my hair look great each time! I never use products in my hair or styling tools (I am hair-challened). The most I may do is blow-dry my hair, otherwise I air dry and scruch with hands/toss hair upside down until dried. My hair has never looked better than using RenPure. It gives me shine, bounce and accents my slight natural waves and the smell is fantastic! Light, slightly sweet without overpowering. I just feel like my hair is healthy and not weighted down. I use it on my A.A. 2 yr old son as well and his curls look amazing each week I wash his hair and smell even better! It is safe, check out ingredient list, made in U.S.A., works, and is affordable. Please don&#x27;t hesitate to give this a try if you are looking for an affordable Wen alternative!  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents in the line, too:)</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical to try this product but decided for the price I had nothing to lose (other than maybe my 10 bucks!). First, some background. I am 51 but blessed with thick, healthy hair. I color my hair once a month and the roots more frequently. I have been using Loreal Everpure almost exclusively for the past three years. I had been searching for a new shampoo (mostly because I was bored) but I absolutely wanted something that was sulfate free. I looked at the new Pantene line and Nexus but both contain sulfate. When I came across the Renpure I was intrigued. I had seen those Wen infomercials which looked cool but are pretty spendy if you&#x27;re not Alyssa Milano. Anyway, I decided to see what the Renpure would do. My hair falls just past my shoulders in length. I followed the directions precisely except I used two extra pumps. I applied the creme starting at the scalp but running most of it through my strands. I combed it through with a comb and left it on while I showered, shaved and exfolliated, careful to rinse it thoroughly. My hair had a weird \\&quot;glassy\\&quot; feel when I first tried to comb it out so I applied a couple of pumps as directed to detangle and that worked fine. I applied no additional products and blew my hair dry as usual. WOW! I was immediately impressed! I haven&#x27;t seen my hair that soft and shiny in years! And smooth too! The best part was I didn&#x27;t need to layer all the usual products in my hair which saved me a good 10 minutes. No root lifter, no foundation mist, no argon, no nothing. Blow and go! And my hair still looked great the next day! I have been using Renpure all week and am super happy with the results. The hardest part will likely be breaking myself of all those products. My cousin also tried it. She and I are the same age and have the same length hair but hers is thin and fine. She loved the Renpure too! All I can say is don&#x27;t be afraid to try this product! Chances are you will love it too! I gave the Renpure four stars because I live ina very arid climate. I will need a few weeks before I know if the Renpure is keeping my hair sufficiently hydrated. I&#x27;ll keep you posted!</li>
    <li> Great product, but not thrilled with the scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Not only is the smell indescribable, but there&#x27;s no yucky stuff! My hair has literally been transformed; it has never been so shiny and soft. I picked it up at Walgreens on a whim because it was bogo. I had colored my hair and it came out horribly, so I was buying some color remover and a deep conditioner to repair the damage. I used this instead of shampoo to get all of the gunk out and didn&#x27;t even need the deep conditioner. I have used this instead of a shampoo/conditioner combo since then and I will never go back! Not only is my hair shiny and soft now, but the amount that I lose on a daily basis (which was a LOT due to my autoimmune disorders, and I had tried many different natural \\&quot;cures\\&quot; for hair loss)has been reduced significantly. It apparently only provides these results for about half of the people who use it, but for 10 bucks (about what you&#x27;d spend on the average shampoo and conditioner set)it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Sorry I thought it would be like Wen but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for several years, and I hate the price! This is not the first less expensive item I have tried, but it is the first I&#x27;ve re-ordered and continued to use.  Not as thick as Wen, but seriously moisturizing, and smells pretty nice.  I use more of this product than I do of the Wen, but it&#x27;s one-third!! the cost!  If you are looking for a way to stretch your dollars, keep your colored hair or sensitive scalp happy- buy this.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of pomegrante.  I like Wen, but a little pricey for some of us.  I will be trying this out and I will get back on a more extensive review.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product. At first I actually did. The first day my hair looked great. The second time I washed with it it became kind of oily at the roots. By day three it was limp and kind of gross looking. Day four of washing with Renpure cleansing conditioner my mother pulled me aside and asked when was the last time I showered. My hair looked disgusting! My mother said my hair even smelled unwashed. I was so embarrassed  that I went home and showered for a second time that day and used my old shampoo. I will take my dry clean looking hair over being told I look unwashed. Sorry but I would not recommend this to anyone. Btw I had to shampoo twice to get my scalp clean. I noticed it seemed to get good reviews from people with thinner hair. Maybe that is my issue cause I have thick course long hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I was tired of my color treated hair fading so quickly.  I had healthy hair but it took a ton of products to keep it that way, too.  So, I wanted to try Wen but the price ran me away. When I found this product I jumped on it.  I have not been disappointed!  I didn&#x27;t really have a break in period like many here did - my hair loved it from day one.  For 3-4 cleansings I had to still use regular conditioner on the ends, but now no longer have to do that.  I also figured out that if I brush my hair before entering the shower, I use WAY less product.  I don&#x27;t use a comb in the shower, just finger comb it through after scrubbing it into my roots and scalp.  There are very few products that I rave over, and this is definitely one of them. I love the scent, too!  And it does make my color last a lot longer!!  The only other product I use on my hair is a shine serum, but over all I use a lot less than before.  I used to use shampoo, conditioner, a leave in conditioner (Miracle7), plus the shine serum.  I now only use the Renpure and a little shine serum, so I&#x27;m saving a lot of money, too.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use it when I don&#x27;t plan on blow drying my hair and am just going to put gel in it and let it air dry. I have thick somewhat wavy hair but using Renpure brings out the wavy texture even more before it moisturizes my hair so well. My hair is so soft and very little frizz. I gave it four stars because I wish I could use it for when I blow dried my hair but it makes it a little heavier than I would like for a blow-out. I also use about 45 pumps per use like another reviewer suggested. 10-12 pumps just doesn&#x27;t get it clean enough for my liking.</li>
    <li> First and foremost. It&#x27;s very expensive here and about $10 less at a store with a big red bullseye. ;) Second. I have a pixie with long bangs and always colored. I have wanted to try WEN but I refused to pay that much. I found this by pure chance. I don&#x27;t love it...yet. I&#x27;ve heard it takes a few uses to get use to. My daughter, who has long thick hair has used it twice and I&#x27;m AMAZED at the results! No frizz, no tangles! So why I see it work for her long hair, my short hair, not so much. It feels dirty still and I could style it with zero product. Yuck! But I&#x27;ll give it a few more tries!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Love it. I have to really work the scalp (I have long hair and the head could become oily if not  rubbed in enough) but worth it. I have to flip my hair forward and work in the cleansing conditioner. My hair strands tends to fall out in the shower instead when brushing, just a heads up. This is normal.</li>
    <li> After reading a bunch of reviews - both good and bad - I decided to try this product. I figured, with the price I wasn&#x27;t out too much if I didn&#x27;t like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed one reviewers advice and used this product but followed the WEN instructions. I used this last night for the first time, and this morning, my hair feels GREAT! I can run my fingers through it, it is soft, and looks great. I have a lot of fine hair that is very, very long. At this time, I will continue to use this product. If my opinion changes, I will update this review!</li>
    <li> FIRST REVIEW FOR RENPURE: Bought at Walgreens, but wanted to add my review, nonetheless. I am 62, and have long, mostly dark brown hair. I read a lot of reviews for this product, and the one that interested me a lot, was one from a man that stated he could \\&quot;swear\\&quot; his hair was returning to its natural color after using the Renpure Cleansing Conditioner for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical, at first, as I love the sudsy action of shampoo, but thought I had nothing to lose, as my hair&#x27;s condition was just not pleasing me. I used a lot more than they suggested on the bottle, and after applying it to my wet hair, wrapped a towel around my head, and let the Renpure \\&quot;do its thing\\&quot; for about 5 minutes. I then thoroughly rinsed it out, and dried my hair with a blow dryer, as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were great, and it seems that every time I use it, the results get better. My hair has body, which is has not for a long time, and it is definite, that the gray hairs are beginning to grow in dark brown. Until now, I was not aware that anything but a change in diet would accomplish that, but it IS happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with it, and will continue to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: My original review was a 5-star review. Now, it is a 2-star review. My hair looked great, but I have stopped using RenPure Cleansing Conditioners - for one reason, and one reason only. It was making my hair fall out! I have long hair, even at 62, and it seemed to be helping to eliminate any gray hairs I had, and encouraging new growth - BUT - I was losing a LOT of hair every time I used it. I noticed that my wet hands would have an inordinate amount of hair on them, when I was rinsing it out. At first, I thought it was simply an adjustment to using a different product, but the hair loss continued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the great smell, which I actually like, and the beautiful results I had with it, when my hair was dry, I did not care for the major hair loss. I have no idea which ingredient caused that, but I am not fond of losing gobs of hair when I use a cleansing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started using Christina Moss Naturals Conditioner recently - as of yesterday - and the hair loss was zilch. One day is not a good time frame for a review, but it did prove to me that the hair loss was caused by the RenPure product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they ever change the formula, to eliminate whatever it is that makes hair fall out, I may try it again, but for now, it is off my hair care regime.am not fond of losing gobs of hair when I use a cleansing conditioner.

    <li> $13.54?????? That&#x27;s insane! I love this stuff so so much but I would never spend that much for it!  I&#x27;ll switch to mint for $6.99 before I get this!</li>
    <li> Oh, I had such high hopes for this product. I read reviews on Amazon and was going to purchase it here but happened to run into some at a discount price locally, so I bought a bottle to try. I have thick, coily African American hair that in spite of its look is actually very delicate. I&#x27;d been looking for a good cleansing conditioner to use so I could cut down on shampoos in the hopes that my hair would be less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I used this according to directions and found it to be just &#x27;okay&#x27;. My hair was soft to the touch, however it was stiffer than usual and had a dull look. It felt ... coated. However it smelled great and doing the scrunch test could feel that was definitely moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product wasn&#x27;t awful, but it wasn&#x27;t great either - at least not for my hair type and texture.</li>
    <li> My hair is very, very dry due to weather, length, genetics, constant heat treatments, and whatever else -- I lost the hair lottery for sure.  It is also very curly, and is most often quite a mess. I prefer to wear it blown out, but even when blowing it out, it would end up straw-like and frizzy  After running out of the Matrix Exquisite Oil conditioner and having a conditioner emergency, I went to the drugstore to see if there were any new products for super deep heavy conditioning, and came across this Renpure Cleansing Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: before buying this product, and actually, before reading the reviews here today, I never heard of Wen.  I actually never heard of any kind of \\&quot;cleansing conditioner,\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t realize it was this new thing people were doing.  So I didn&#x27;t know this was a copy of another product, or that this kind of product even existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t really understand what I was doing.  It smelled horrible, like, smelled up my whole bathroom, the smell is awful, like medicine and peppermint and pesticide or something.  I coated my hair with it, like I usually did with regular conditioner, and then rinsed it out.  My hair felt terrible in the shower.  I ended up staying in the shower and using my older products thinking this product was a total failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a long ski week, the cold air made my hair even more horrible than usual, so I gave it another shot yesterday.  This time I actually read the bottle, and realized you&#x27;re supposed to rub it around like shampoo.  I didn&#x27;t, however, pay attention to how many pumps I used, as I didn&#x27;t know there was some kind of exact formula here -- I just kept pumping until my hair felt super coated (WAY more than 15 pumps), then I rubbed my head like I normally would to clean my hair, then ran a brush through it, and left it there to soak in while I showered.  Washed it out after about 15 - 25 minutes, all felt fine.  Not like before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the real test came -- straightening my hair.  I always use the Matrix Exquisite Oil when I straighten, so I did the same.  Only this time it was completely different -- when I blew the strands out, they weren&#x27;t frizzy like normal.  My hair was actually flat, like, really flat, zero frizz.  It was also so so so soft, when I was done, I made everyone feel my hair!  It feels so soft and nice, unreal that I could have such beautiful hair finally.  The smell didn&#x27;t stick, thank goodness.  My hair has never looked so perfect, it is like a hair commercial.  I am so happy I found this product, and came here to buy more already.</li>
    <li> To date, I have LOVED Renpure Organics products. But then I used Ren. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30 on a bottle of Wen and thought this would be a good substitute. Boy, was I disapointed. I used this product for the first time this morning and even in the shower I could tell my hair was going to feel greasy and heavy - this was confirmed when I was blow drying and styling my hair. My hair has the same appearance it has when I skip a shower or two. I understand that there is no such thing as a \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; product, but it would be nice if there was so no one would ever have to be so disappointed in a product like this. I do not recommend this product. In fact, I will be cleaning out the pump and returning the bottle to the drugstore I purchased it from.</li>
    <li> I too was looking for a good Wen alternative and found Ren at my local Walgreens and decided to give it a try since the price was reasonable. This is, by far, the absolute worse product I have ever put in my hair. My hair is so greasy, it literally looks like a washed it with baby oil. I am truly shocked by the good reviews. My hair is heavy, greasy and just feels like I haven&#x27;t washed it in a week. Horrible, horrible product. Complete waste of money and would not recommend anyone to even try it.</li>
    <li> **Edit: 5/16/2013** Changed from five stars to two&lt;br /&gt;I have to first start off by saying that the first bottle worked so well for me that I decided to buy a second when it ran out. Somewhere along the line, the formula for this cleansing conditioner changed. The first bottle I had was super watery and worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second bottle (bought from the same place) was thick and gloppy. I don&#x27;t know what it is about the second bottle I bought, but I see where all the negative reviews came from! After trying the second bottle for the first time, my hair was filmy, greasy and just down right nasty. Yuck. I won&#x27;t use this product again for fear of getting their \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; gloppy mess of a formula. I have to throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to apologize for saying that people were using it incorrectly. If anyone from Ren is reading this, change your formula back to the runny version. This gloppy stuff is way too thick, does not spread and makes my hair feel disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that this product works for about 50% or less of the reviews, so I was shocked that it worked so well for me! My hair is short and very fine, but I have lots of it. It gets really oily if I don&#x27;t wash every day, so I was very hesitant about buying a conditioner to WASH my hair. I love this stuff and have been using it for a week now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the key is that you have to massage it in and MASSAGE it out when rinsing. I haven&#x27;t had any grease issues, which is saying a lot. My hair is very shiny and soft. The bottle says to use 10-12 pumps, but I use 6-8 on my less-than-shoulder-length hair. Just make sure you saturate your hair, massage gently around until everything is covered (make sure you \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; the scalp area) and then rinse out doing the same scalp scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find your hair is greasy, try the massage technique and make sure you use enough to cover your hair! If you don&#x27;t have enough on, there isn&#x27;t enough to move around and clean. I hope this helps! I think I&#x27;ve found my new shampoo for life (and, though a bit expensive for a drug store shampoo, it is still cheaper than buying separate shampoo and conditioner).here isn&#x27;t enough to move around and clean.
