### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The mask fits perfectly over my eyes.</li>
      <li>A very nice addition to any Gintama fan&#x27;s collection.</li>
      <li>good price.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice for cosplaying but not for sleeping.</li>
      <li>Cheap and good, just the way I like it.</li>
      <li>and I bring it to travel&#x3D;]</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Really funny, useful, and just a great thing to carry around while traveling even people who dont know where its from still stop, stare, and burst out laughing</li>
      <li>The front is nice and soft while the part that covers your eyes is nice and silky.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t block out the light.</li>
      <li>If you want it to block out the light while you sleep, it won&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>comfortable as a sleep mask</li>
      <li>I even tried having my one year old son wear it and it was adorable, just like a mini Sougo :)</li>
      <li>The only downside is that the mask is probably meant to be more of a cosplay item since some light leaks through the bottom of the mask when it&#x27;s worn.</li>
      <li>Just as described and is also good for scaring siblings in the dark</li>
      <li>feels not that soft but works fine.</li>
      <li>It looks exactly like the one in the photo.</li>
      <li>Only the down side is that you can still see some light from below, this one is more for cosplay and fun rather than effectiveness.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>A little on the cheap side</li>
      <li>received early.</li>
      <li>Left side is sewn just under the &amp;#34;eyes&amp;#34; while the right is sewn above the &amp;#34;eyes&amp;#34;.  </li>

    <li> Cheap and good, just the way I like it. Only the down side is that you can still see some light from below, this one is more for cosplay and fun rather than effectiveness.</li>
    <li> received early. acceptable quality. feels not that soft but works fine. good price. recommended.</li>
    <li> Just as described and is also good for scaring siblings in the dark</li>
    <li> I like this mask and I bring it to travel&#x3D;] I do take a lots of pictures when I wear it because it looks mad funny when you are wearing it. The only thing bad is that some little light will comes in from the bottom when you wear it&#x3D;/</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice for cosplaying but not for sleeping. It doesn&#x27;t block out the light. If you want it to block out the light while you sleep, it won&#x27;t.</li>

    <li> Item finally arrived....it is as expected...</li>
    <li> The mask fits perfectly over my eyes. It looks exactly like the one in the photo. The front is nice and soft while the part that covers your eyes is nice and silky. The only downside is that the mask is probably meant to be more of a cosplay item since some light leaks through the bottom of the mask when it&#x27;s worn. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product. I even tried having my one year old son wear it and it was adorable, just like a mini Sougo :)</li>
    <li> Entirely met my expectations. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The material is thin but comfy, and the elastic is stretchy enough even to fit a big noggin like mine. A very nice addition to any Gintama fan&#x27;s collection.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sleeping mask that has eyes on it.</li>
    <li> A little on the cheap side but it&#x27;s a $3 Gintama toy that has some practical use. Buy one for everyone in your family and wear them on the airplane.</li>
    <li> The headband was sewn to the mask unevenly, making it awkward and uncomfortable to put on.  Left side is sewn just under the &amp;#34;eyes&amp;#34; while the right is sewn above the &amp;#34;eyes&amp;#34;.  Weird.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality &amp; material.&lt;br /&gt;Go watch gintama if you haven&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not comfortable as a sleep mask: The elastic string is too tight. Would be nicer to run laces instead.&lt;br /&gt;It would look nicer if the eyes were 15%~20% smaller</li>
    <li> I love it but my boyfriend does not like it. It annoys his and that is a plus. I sleep like a baby with these things on.</li>
    <li> I love it! And I get it in time!</li>
