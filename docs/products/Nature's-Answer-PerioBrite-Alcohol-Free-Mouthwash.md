      <li>the cinnamon mouthwash, love it too.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about this product.</li>
      <li>While it does have a strong taste, (which I love since it really tastes clean), it is best not to eat or drink for 10 minutes after using to let this sink into your gums.</li>

      <li>Just gives your mouth a nice fresh, clean  feeling.  </li>
      <li>I am not crazy about mint, but even their mint flavor is refreshing.</li>
      <li>Combined with the PerioBrite toothpaste, this is essential for great oral care.</li>
      <li>very tingly and nice.</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time &amp; was pleasantly surprised at how great it tasted</li>
      <li>and though the myrr and clove oil etc might make it feel better and maybe it wasn&#x27;t the mouthwash the first time.</li>
      <li>Leaves the mouth feeling fresh!</li>
      <li>Really enjoy this true natural refreshing mouthwash!</li>
      <li>This is just as refreshing, without the alcohol-sting, and my sensitive teeth and gums love it.  </li>
      <li>Probably won&#x27;t cure herpes though, so clean your act up sluts.</li>
      <li>You do have to shake the bottle well before use to get the full benefit.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t taste as wonderful, but at least I know its protecting my teeth.  </li>
      <li>I really like the flavor of this mouthwash, and it is refreshing.  </li>
      <li>It also has a kind of old fashioned medicine mouthwash smell along with cinnamon after you use it.</li>
      <li>but it was also super sweet.</li>
      <li>Since I have Gingivitis, I wanted to control the germs and keep my mouth clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>It is pretty tingly!</li>
      <li>The cinamint is very intense and leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>fresh enough.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean and refreshing and much better than the typical mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the $$$</li>
      <li>Nice rinse and a good buy compared to other, similar products on the market.</li>
      <li>It really makes your mouth feel fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>Also good for canker sores and other (non-tobacco) mouth cancers.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only one that leaves my gums super healthy.</li>
      <li>I purchased PerioWash, Cool Mint from Whole Foods</li>
      <li>, 1 cap full doesn&#x27;t burn as much, but I don&#x27;t like minty</li>
      <li>I think the breath-freshening aspects lasts longer than the more traditional mouthwashes.</li>
      <li>I first used this with a toothache</li>
      <li>The first thing that I noticed was my gums felt refreshed without the burning.</li>
      <li>It leaves my mouth feeling very clean and SIGNIFICANTLY cuts down on morning mouth issues if you use right before bed.  </li>
      <li>what is great is that just 2 capfuls (the cap is very small) in a glass and rinse is all that is needed.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>like the ingredients, and no artificial dyes or coloring was main reason bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Cool</li>
      <li>I have tried many natural rinses, from PerioTherapy, The Natural Dentist, Toms of Maine and others.</li>
      <li>You pretty much get used to the spicy burning.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;it does dry your mouth out considerably more than listerine/scope, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Still, will use this from now on.</li>
      <li>The taste might be strong for some, one friend described it as similar to Scope, but it is much healthier for your teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>It is very soothing to my teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.  </li>
      <li>What else is there to say but it really freshens up your breath eliminating morning breath.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this mouth-wash.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go the Listerine route ever again.  This is just as refreshing, without the alcohol-sting, and my sensitive teeth and gums love it.  The taste is cinnamony with an undertone of mint.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.  I find you can use a little less than the suggested amount.  You do have to shake the bottle well before use to get the full benefit. I think the breath-freshening aspects lasts longer than the more traditional mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to the Chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide combination I was using for my perio rinse. I will update my review after my next dentist check-up.</li>
    <li> Nice Cinnamon burn in place of the alcohol does a good job of cleaning without chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash! Leaves the mouth feeling fresh! Not for children due to strong herbs.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I like having a minty feeling in my mouth and the cinnamon isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I use this after I brush my teeth and flossing.</li>
    <li> Clean refreshing flavor &amp; it helps my mouth feel good.</li>
    <li> The most effective mouthwash ever it goes way beyond just fresh breath.</li>
    <li> Great mouth wash, great taste. I prefer my mouth wash to be alcohol  free and do a good job of helping plaque stay to a minimum between dental visits.</li>
    <li> very tingly and nice. I know that nothing can restore receding gums, but this does seem to be halting progression, combined with the toothpaste. I have already ordered my second bottle, and am trying the cinnamon this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried the cinnamon mouthwash, love it too.</li>
    <li> I guess everyone else agrees as well, as they&#x27;re having a hard time keeping this item in stock. I recently had my 4 bottle subscription reduced to 3 bottles due to availability. The cinamint is very intense and leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! This is the finest mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used!! To say it leaves your mouth tingling and fresh is an understatement!!! And, it&#x27;s all  natural and alcohol free!!! Well done!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite mouthwash! Never will I use Listerine again!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to love this product, purchased it on sale.  I really love it and will purchase more.  It&#x27;s clean and refreshing and much better than the typical mouthwash.  It&#x27;s worth the $$$</li>
    <li> Sometimes when I dip snuff I think I am getting mouth cancer. I quit for a while and use this stuff to rinse the cancer away. So far, it has worked. Also good for canker sores and other (non-tobacco) mouth cancers. Probably won&#x27;t cure herpes though, so clean your act up sluts.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Knew exactly what I was getting after reading other reviews.  I also knew I needed sodium floride in my wash, so I ordered The natural dentist Healthy Teeth at the same time.  I use one in the AM and one in the PM. PerioBrite tastes soooo much better!</li>
    <li> For years, I have been a Listerine user 3 to 4 times a day to control my breath. Since I have Gingivitis, I wanted to control the germs and keep my mouth clean and fresh. Listerine works so well but for me, the burning was a turn off. So I looked for a natural mouthwash with herbs to help my breath and help to heal my gums. The first thing that I noticed was my gums felt refreshed without the burning. Love the cinnamon-minty taste!&lt;br /&gt;My gums and cleaner and mouth fresher and as a bonus, I found that I have pink gums now no more red gums.&lt;br /&gt;And what is great is that just 2 capfuls (the cap is very small) in a glass and rinse is all that is needed.&lt;br /&gt;Also I use from Nature&#x27;s Answer: PerioBrite Toothpaste, PerioRub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this, it is gentle, tastes great and WORKS!</li>
    <li> This mouthwash was recommended by a friend that works for Whole Foods.  Said it was a top seller.  I tried it and thought it was the best.  Better than listerine and has no fluoride.</li>
    <li> It really makes your mouth feel fresh and clean.  I use it BEFORE I brush my teeth rather than AFTER, contrary to instructions simply because that&#x27;s what I am used to from my previous mouthwash, and I have come to like that method, but yes, I really like it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually did anything for my mouth but it definitely numbs any sores,cuts,etc in your mouth for a while. But it definitely burns. You pretty much get used to the spicy burning. It didn&#x27;t heal anything but definitely numbed my mouth when I had a cut on my tongue.</li>
    <li> I really like this mouthwash. It&#x27;s nice knowing that there isn&#x27;t any fluoride in this mouthwash. What else is there to say but it really freshens up your breath eliminating morning breath. Taste is not that bad but actually pretty good. But I like the taste of cinnamon so that could just be a bias.</li>
    <li> So, I used this for awhile and it burned my tongue so badly, then I broke out in inflamed taste buds and a weird taste on my tongue the didn&#x27;t leave for a few weeks after I quit using the rinse. I then set it aside for awhile, but got a toothache and though the myrr and clove oil etc might make it feel better and maybe it wasn&#x27;t the mouthwash the first time. I used it twice and by the second time I had a repeat performance, just not the weird taste/sensation in the middle of my tongue for so long. Be very careful using this, I know everyone&#x27;s experience will be different. This was mine, I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff! Makes the mouth feel very refreshed and the natural ingredients are a plus. I will definitely use this again.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash tastes excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that after a few days, I found that the bottom back of my tongue was getting a bit raw because the mouthwash is a bit too strong for me at least.....NO PROBLEM....I simply use a 1 part filtered water to 1 part mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;It still leave my breath fresh enough.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Ive been wanting to try this and was trying to decide which flavor and @ the time this was cheaper than the mint. And I have the mint tooth paste and I wish I would have got the this flavor instead. U don&#x27;t taste so much of a herbal taste w/this flavor and it has a nice kick to it which I like in my mouth wash (helps open up the sinus etc). If ur on the fence I say go for it. Its about the same price as reg. mouth wash.</li>
    <li> The Cinnamint  flavor is pleasant and does not leave any distasteful after-taste.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, no toxic ingredients</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the most deceptive and bad dental care product I have ever used. Do not expect your gums to get better or stay healthy! If you have any kind of recession of the gums, no matter how small, I would not recommend using this mouthwash. Here&#x27;s what happened to me after using it for about six months. In the beginning it burned my mouth for a while but I got over it. I had two pockets in the lower gums and now I have six and they are not getting better while using this mouthwash. In fact, they are getting worse and I finally figured out why - it says so on the bottle: &amp;#34;softens the gums.&amp;#34; I mistakenly assumed that it meant it would make the gums also bond to the teeth better. The opposite happened: the gums loosened. Please, don&#x27;t ask. I&#x27;m not usually this stupid when it comes to dental care. Now I am switching to sea buckthorn seed oil in the hope that this will fix the recession that the Perio mouthwash aggrevated.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash but both the cinnamon and the mint are so hot, it made my eyes water.  I am not a baby about heat either.  But, I still recommend this product.  It leaves my mouth feeling very clean and SIGNIFICANTLY cuts down on morning mouth issues if you use right before bed.  The aftertaste reminds me of thyme, so if you dont like an herbal taste, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.  Overall, I like this product but due to the heat, I recommend for adults only.</li>
    <li> I purchased PerioWash, Cool Mint from Whole Foods one day and I really liked it. When the bottle ran out, I decided to purchase the next bottle on Amazon because I knew it would be cheaper, but the only flavor they had available for Prime shipping was Cinamint. I&#x27;m not really a fan of cinnamon, but I figured I could live with it. I liked Big Red gum once upon a time so how bad could it be?...What a stupid idea that was. Using this mouthwash is painful. At first it wasn&#x27;t too bad. It burned a little, but it was bearable so I decided I&#x27;d just finish the bottle and get a different flavor next time...Nope. It&#x27;s gotten MUCH worse since then. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week and as of today, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use this product ever again. It&#x27;s been two hours since I used the rinse and my gums/tongue are still sore. That Cinamin bottle is definitely going in the trash.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my local health food store owner who gave me some sample bottles.  Works great, no burning like listerine!  Great prices sometimes available at Amazon.  Win, win situation.</li>
    <li> I have a chronic hard time with my gums. BUT this stuff works! I noticed a difference almost immediately. I will be buying it again and again!</li>
    <li> I love this mouth wash. I love the idea it has no alcohol the taste is great and keeps my mouth feeling fresh for hours. I ove it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about this product. The instructions say use 2 cap fulls but 2 really burns and I have a hard time keeping it in my mouth for the recommended time, 1 cap full doesn&#x27;t burn as much, but I don&#x27;t like minty stuff.&lt;br /&gt; It also tastes too sugary and if I use it before bed I wake up tasting as if I hadn&#x27;t brushed the night before, even if I use 2 caps, so I think this doesn&#x27;t help  my oral health, but hurts it. It also has a kind of old fashioned medicine mouthwash smell along with cinnamon after you use it. It&#x27;s ok for during the day but I won&#x27;t use it before bed.</li>
    <li> Note that this seller does not list all the ingredients. I used it for the first time &amp; was pleasantly surprised at how great it tasted but it was also super sweet. When I had a look at the back of the bottle I found the base ingredient was GLYCERINE! If this ingredient was listed when I bought it online at Amazon, I would not have bought it. Glycerine is not good for teeth, I for one certainly don&#x27;t want to go to bed with my teeth coated in thick sugary syrup. I&#x27;m disappointed as the other ingredients were awesome, but sadly negated by the addition of glycerine. Have returned the product and invested in Vita-Myr instead. Doesn&#x27;t taste as wonderful, but at least I know its protecting my teeth.  http://www.amazon.com/VITA-MYR-Zinc-Plus-Xtra-Herbal-Mouthwash/dp/B000VY20B2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_cc_1?s&#x3D;aps&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1425925466&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords&#x3D;vita+mouthwash</li>
    <li> I bought this because I like the toothpaste.  The taste of this is good but it burns my mouth within seconds so I can&#x27;t keep it there for long.  I won&#x27;t buy another bottle because of that.</li>
    <li> Takes care of my bad breath.  Nice rinse and a good buy compared to other, similar products on the market.</li>
    <li> Cinnamint Flavor is Great and I like that is has herbs and CoQ10. Very pleased! Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It has a great taste (prefer the Cinamint to the cool mint).  I go back to the dentist in a month.  On my last dental visit after using the cool mint for several months the hygenist said that I had less plaque than I ever had so this product works!</li>
    <li> This mouthwash works great and tastes great! I love the fact that it&#x27;s made with all-natural ingredients! It is spicy though, so bear that in mind if you have a low tolerance or a sensitive mouth.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the combination of my toothpaste then using this.  If I swish it for a few seconds the burning dissipates.  I like it, but won&#x27;t be using it everyday.</li>
    <li> like the ingredients, and no artificial dyes or coloring was main reason bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Cool mint flavor is good, doesnt burn that bad, but my 9 year old had a hard time keeping in his mouth&lt;br /&gt;for more than 10 seconds. A little bit better 2nd time he took it, and he likes taste.&lt;br /&gt;Sick of buying him these colorful cartoon caracter mouthwashes with ridiculous coloring and chemicals added&lt;br /&gt;The FDA is a criminal organization and a joke for passing such items to be given to our children.&lt;br /&gt;But then again they approved pink slime on burgers so what do you expect from them?&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I enjoyed this mouthwash, leaves a great clove/mint like taste on your mouth, but after using at night&lt;br /&gt;it does dry your mouth out considerably more than listerine/scope, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Still, will use this from now on.</li>
    <li> this product is the 2nd one I purchased love theproduct, except this one that I received was not the same &amp;#34;strength as the first one I purchased. I called Natures answer direct and the rep contacted me back explaining that it must have ome from different batches of product and she will gladky send me a complimentary bottlle to replace that one.......haven not rec&#x27;d it as yet.....3 wks.......</li>
    <li> Just gives your mouth a nice fresh, clean  feeling.  That it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol and other chemicals is a plus for me.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It is pretty tingly! Took me a little getting used to but I love it now.</li>
    <li> I really like this mouthwash and the corresponding toothpaste. I use the cinnamon version because I like the intensity of the flavor and&amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; in the mouth. However, one of the mint flavors might be  better suited for most people. A great product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many natural rinses, from PerioTherapy, The Natural Dentist, Toms of Maine and others. None compare to PerioWash. The bottles I have feature the new packaging. I am not crazy about mint, but even their mint flavor is refreshing. The Cinnamon is my favorite. It has a wonderful, herbal scent and a great taste that zings! It is very soothing to my teeth and gums. Combined with the PerioBrite toothpaste, this is essential for great oral care. I love the CoQ10, Orgegano and herbs in the formula. While it does have a strong taste, (which I love since it really tastes clean), it is best not to eat or drink for 10 minutes after using to let this sink into your gums. I first used this with a toothache and it really healed my inflamed gums (along with the PerioRub and PerioBrite toothpaste). This is the best rinse I have ever used. I believe that you will love it too. The taste might be strong for some, one friend described it as similar to Scope, but it is much healthier for your teeth and gums. Can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> Very good product for your oral health!</li>
    <li> I really like the flavor of this mouthwash, and it is refreshing.  It may be a bit more tingly than some other mouthwash, but I like that.  It does contain vegetable glycerin, and I have read that glycerin prevents self healing of the teeth, but I am no expert on the subject.  I don&#x27;t know if this is actually a problem or not.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash! It&#x27;s the only one that leaves my gums super healthy.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this true natural refreshing mouthwash! Excellent seller</li>
