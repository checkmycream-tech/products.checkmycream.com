      <li>These Intuition cartridges can be so expensive--I was so glad to see Amazon offering a jumbo pack for a pretty low cost.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love my intuition razor, but the blades are so expensive.  </li>

      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>We are spoiled to modern conveniences, what happened to lathering the area to be shaved with soap?</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Plus it comes with a brand new razor head, so</li>
      <li>The box that&#x27;s advertised shows a brand new shaving set in addition to the cartridges.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have to chase around to find the sales on refills and it includes new handle also.  </li>

      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the price and amount of refills.</li>
      <li>I was sent the 12-pack of cartridges with 1 razor handle as described, but instead of being the pictured product (Plus Sensitive Care) they were the Naturals Sensitive Care.  </li>
      <li>Skin stays soft and you can use it as often as you want.</li>

<li> (The reason I only gave 4 stars is because I wish the razors lasted a little longer.)</li>
<li> These are getting harder to find in stores</li>
<li> I am one of those kind of people who hate having to shave my legs, so the easier</li>
<li> Since you have to replace the blade when the solid runs down, you don&#x27;t have to worry about using the blades for too long to get dull either.</li>
<li> I ran out of cartridges with my other Schick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite razor. This was a good bunch,you could use them all the way down to nothing, and they did not break off at all!</li>
    <li> This razor works like a charm.  I was worried when I could not find refills in the store so I came to Amazon.  I was pleasantly surprised at the price and amount of refills.</li>
    <li> I love the Schick Intuition!  The cartridges are cool because you don&#x27;t need shaving cream and the sensitive care cartridges gives you smooth results with no irritation.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Schick Intution for several years now and don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to messy shaving cream and razor blades.  I love how convenient and easy it is!</li>
    <li> This was a good product.  My only complaint was the 9.95 s/h for razors.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! The cartridges are a little expensive, but it never nicks my legs and I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream at all!</li>
    <li> These shaving heads are very good just too expensive.  We are spoiled to modern conveniences, what happened to lathering the area to be shaved with soap?</li>
    <li> Just like the ones my wife buys at the supermarket, but 60 percent of the price!  Great deal on a fine product.</li>
    <li> Purchasing razors from Amazon in bulk is one of the best things. Razors are so expensive</li>
    <li> i have purchased these razors several times and i know the product will be in good condition and much cheaper than in the drug store. i now only buy through amazon.  thanks seller!</li>
    <li> Received one pack of 12 razors just as advertised - but also got a razor handle in the pack. These were 4 blade razor refills in good shape. These are getting harder to find in stores so was happy to find this 12 pack online and at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;(Some reviewers have noted that another seller was shipping old stock that was 3 blades and dried out - not the case here.)</li>
    <li> It is such a good price. Check it out in the store, expensive. I love this razor, it is very convinient and quick, no irritation. But it is pricey, so I am always looking for the deal. This is a very good price.</li>
    <li> The SCHICK intuition plus is the only razor I use. Because it has the soap bar attached no gel is needed and its a very smooth shave</li>
    <li> These cartridges work great with the attached moisturizing, however the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would prefer. Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> I love these razors!  I&#x27;ve been purchasing them @ Walmart, but their prices have gotten ridiculous!  I&#x27;m so glad I found them on Amazon. I will be buying them online from now on!  (The reason I only gave 4 stars is because I wish the razors lasted a little longer.)</li>
    <li> I ran out of cartridges with my other Schick. So I got the same ones again. Works great, just wish the soap bars lasted longer</li>
    <li> As far as I know, the products are as good as always - haven&#x27;t used any of this batch yet.  I buy the cartridges online because they&#x27;re the same quality as in the stores and much cheaper :)</li>
    <li> Since they have the shave cream and blades in one unit, these shaving cartridges are efficient and practical for regular use. Buying them in this 12 cartridge pack is very economical compared to expensive 3 cartridge packs in stores.</li>
    <li> I was very leery about purchasing razors online as I read that there are fakes out there. I think making sure you order directly from Amazon makes the difference, because these are the real deal!</li>
    <li> They jumped their prices $7 since the last time I ordered.... No way. Walmart or Sams Club is the way to go on these..</li>
    <li> These Intuition cartridges can be so expensive--I was so glad to see Amazon offering a jumbo pack for a pretty low cost.  True Schick Intuition cartridges.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite razors, this is an amazing value!! I will definitely purchase this pack again! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> Love these! Glad I could get a bulk order! Glad to get new razor also! This item amazing! Happy now</li>
    <li> Great razors for sensitive skin.  Convenient to use too.  I only use these razors so it was great to buy a dozen at once too.</li>
    <li> Everytime I run out of razors I say I&#x27;m going to look for a cheaper alternative but I always come back to these. You just can&#x27;t beat the convenience!</li>
    <li> Great product, wish I could buy even bigger pacs!</li>
    <li> My wife has been searching for a deal. once she seen this on Amazon she was over joyed. This is one fo the best buys of the year she said.</li>
    <li> I have always loved using these blades.  They are perfect if you take showers.  However, you can find this same product a less expensive than this vendor.  Next time I will do more price comparisons.  The product did arrive in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> I am one of those kind of people who hate having to shave my legs, so the easier I can make the process the better. I have used my Schick Intuition razor for years and like how it cuts down on my shaving time.</li>
    <li> I love the Intuition. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I never cut myself. Since you have to replace the blade when the solid runs down, you don&#x27;t have to worry about using the blades for too long to get dull either. They are expensive, but after using the Intuition, I can&#x27;t go back to a regular razor and shave gel. This saves so much time doing everything in one step. The 12 pack is nice since it takes quite a while before you need to buy a new set. It is much more economical than buying a 3 pack at the grocery store as well.</li>
    <li> Great price for the quantity.</li>
    <li> The box that&#x27;s advertised shows a brand new shaving set in addition to the cartridges. However, only 12 cartridges arrived. Shaving set is not included !</li>
    <li> Great value!!  Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I will have these razors for a while and I&#x27;m happy I stocked up on these.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite razors.  I use it all the time and I would definitely do business again</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m disabled, this is the easiest way to shave my legs. I love these. YES, there is waste, but what you going to do. I&#x27;m sure Schick has gotten quite a few million bad comments or reviews. You would think they would get the message. Has nothing to do with sellers. I bought a shaver and refills for my best friend, and she didn&#x27;t like it at first, but I knew her and the shaver. It was soon after she told me &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;. Of course I wouldn&#x27;t recommend something to her after 33yrs I KNEW was worth it.</li>
    <li> My favorite product ever! I wish they had more in stock because I would order more:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so smooth it&#x27;s like running a bar of soap over your skin.  Only thing is they don&#x27;t last long enough.  But they are worth it!</li>
    <li> I love these. Great for the price and are very easy to use. Skin stays soft and you can use it as often as you want.</li>
    <li> my wife and kids love them. Great product at a good price</li>
    <li> Seems like a great deal except that one of the blades was missing. The plastic cap for it was there but not the blade.</li>
    <li> I was sent the 12-pack of cartridges with 1 razor handle as described, but instead of being the pictured product (Plus Sensitive Care) they were the Naturals Sensitive Care.  I actually like the Naturals cartridges better than the pictured product, so I&#x27;m not complaining!</li>
    <li> They stopped selling these at Costco/Sam&#x27;s Club/BJ&#x27;s wholesale.  Now they sell ones with a razor handle as well--do you have to buy one every time? what a waste.</li>
    <li> First one out of the packaging only lasted one day until the moistener bar fell off.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love my intuition razor, but the blades are so expensive.  Was happy to find this many blades at this price b/c I feel better about using it when I can get the best, most responsible deal on each blade.</li>
    <li> These are so crazy expensive - I got these in a combo 12 cartridge pack and saved money.  The new shaver was just a bonus!!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years! Finally no cut ankles or nicks everywhere! I just wish the soap part would last a bit longer...</li>
    <li> so much easier than using the shaving cream separately.&lt;br /&gt;Have used these for years and will continue to.  This is a great&lt;br /&gt;price as well.</li>
    <li> I would like to be able to purchase these refills in greater quantity, without the razor itself. But, this was definitely the best available package/price at the time.</li>
    <li> Love these razors, and they are super expensive so I jumped at the chance to scoop these up!</li>
    <li> Love the intuition razor and this package deal really makes sense.  Don&#x27;t have to chase around to find the sales on refills and it includes new handle also.  All the blades were fresh and love the fact I got this at great price and delivered to the house quickly!!!</li>
    <li> These are the ONLY razors that don&#x27;t destroy my very sensitive leg skin.  I love that they&#x27;re offered in bulk since they are ridiculously expensive.  Plus it comes with a brand new razor head, so bonus!</li>
    <li> A great deal, a smooth transaction!</li>
    <li> love these and would not use anything else.</li>
    <li> She loves them and has to have them.</li>
