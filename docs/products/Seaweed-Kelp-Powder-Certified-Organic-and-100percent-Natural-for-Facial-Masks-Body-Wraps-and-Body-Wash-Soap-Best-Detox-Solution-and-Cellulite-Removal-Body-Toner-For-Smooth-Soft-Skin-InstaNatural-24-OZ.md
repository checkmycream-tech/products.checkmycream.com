      <li>I am not to sure how I would of felt</li>
      <li>Great product, all natural, and effective in softening/smoothing skin and great for various detox remedies!</li>
      <li>This product container is HUGE and filled to the brim!</li>
      <li>The one thing I think would make it better is having a scoop available inside the container.  </li>
      <li>I was stunned when I unboxed it and was faced with a HUGE jar because I was honestly expecting a smaller sized package, but I am happy with what I got.</li>

      <li>This is can easily be achieved yourself with this seaweed powder and saran wrap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Still since this product has strong detoxifying properties I can deal with the scent.  </li>
      <li>The scent is a bit strong like fish food</li>
      <li>The scent should not be a problem however, if you mask it with beautiful scents such as lemon oil, and honey.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved other products from Instanatural and so you better believe I was thrilled to try out this one.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. I use it as a body wrap once a week. I go into my infrared sauna while my legs are &amp;#34;wrapped up&amp;#34; and take everything off in the shower afterwards. I like that my legs are nice and smooth feeling after I use the seaweed extract, and I am also detoxing. The customer service of this company is awesome, they even offered me a free refill! I will definitely continue using this product!</li>
    <li> I noticed a little bit of irritation and also my face was a little puffy the next day. Not sure if it was caused by the powder. I made a mask from this product using honey and some other oils. Great girls night activity.</li>
    <li> So, I have to be totally honest. I like seaweed, I even like the smell of seaweed. This, was just too much though. Not only that, but I could never get it to a consistency that worked for me. I did try to use it as a body wrap. It felt amazing, my skin was so soft and smooth afterwards. I felt better, even. I think if I could better the consistency it would be better, maybe clearer directions! They do say it can get messy, so standing in the bathtub is a good idea. I mixed it in a plastic cup with plastic spoon, so I could easily throw it out. Fair warning: Your garbage can will smell like seaweed if you leave any in the cup! Also, this container is VERY LARGE! I did not realize it, but it is! This will last you so long!&lt;br /&gt;Complementary product received for review.</li>
    <li> Overall, I just can stand the smell. But of course it&#x27;s seaweed. I wish it came already prepared because it&#x27;s hard to get a good consistency.  Will not be buying this again sorry.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff! Normally I am very picky about what I use on my skin and body because I have fair and sensitive skin. This product is great because it is ligitimate all natural stuff that you can mix with natural ingridients from your home to suit your skins needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the back of the container has some suggested recipes for face mask, cellulite scrub, and my favorite- the body wrap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know to some it may seem strange to do an at-home body wrap, but this stuff is so good I lost an inch in my waist/butt/thighs after one wrap with this stuff...no joke, I fit into a pair of jeans that are normally a no-go from time to time...and heres how it goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* use the body wrap recipe on the back of the container to mix together your wrap mud, the recipe says to use olive oil, but I substituted with aloe &amp; vitamin e baby oil to try and mask the seaweed smell of the kelp powder&lt;br /&gt;* take the wrap mud in the shower and on clean dry skin slather on the green kelp mud on desired area&lt;br /&gt;* wrap the slathered area of your body firmly with plastic wrap&lt;br /&gt;* put on loose tshirt/robe/yoga pants to cover your body and keep it warm&lt;br /&gt;* drink at least 16-32 oz of water ( this is to assist in the detox process and can be done before you put the mud on)&lt;br /&gt;* sit or lay down comfortably with the wrap on for 30min-1 hour&lt;br /&gt;* in the shower, carefully cut off the plastic wrap with a scissors and wash off the kelp mud&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin will be smooth and soft and you should see results from one use, for added results, repeat process every 3 days. Great product, all natural, and effective in softening/smoothing skin and great for various detox remedies!</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t kidding when they say you get a big tub of this stuff! You get a lot for your money. And yes it does smell but any one who has ever been the beach won&#x27;t be too offended by this stuff. I love seaweed wraps they just do so many different things for your body. I use the seaweed powder and water then slather it on and use plastic wrap. It really does a great job at toning and tightening. If I use it on my face I mix it with a mint mask I have so that the smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering. And yes all the cat stories are true. Your cats will follow you around and meow at you like you have something special for them.</li>
    <li> My overall opinion on this product was it was cool, the packaging was nice the smell wasn&#x27;t to bad. The consistency of the product wasn&#x27;t to bad depending on what you used the product for you could use it for a face mask/scrub or a cellulite scrub. The product has directions on how to create a mask or a scrub with all the ingredients you would have to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product you have to be careful because it gets really messy when you open the container and when you are using the product. With products like this product I tried the face scrub and the mask, I liked how my face felt afterward it felt soft and cleaned. But I know with any product consistency is the key, in order to see major changes you have to constantly use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> i couldnt believe this product i got it and apparently i didn&#x27;t read exactly what was given because when i got the product i went what in the world 1.5lbs? i was expecting enough for maybe a facial and here i had more than enough for 3 or 4 people! talk about a spa day from head to toe had a blast with the spa day it&#x27;s a quick easy wrap and facial before we knew it the time went from noon to dinner time! i know i saw a huge difference from my oily face before to soft normal skin after. this is fast becoming one of my favs and no stinky kelp smell!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I use this when I get skin rashes and it works! It definitely has a &amp;#34;sea&amp;#34; smell only because it is natural. It&#x27;s easy for me to overcome the smell because the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> Two thumbs up for another great product from InstaNatural!  InstaNatural sent me their Certified Organic &amp; 100% Natural Seaweed Powder a few weeks ago to review for them and it&#x27;s been fun making up different recipes for masks &amp; body scrubs.  Seaweed is excellent at improving skin tone &amp; texture and it&#x27;s also perfect for drawing out all the impurities from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The recipes included on the jar are work REALLY good and they not only detoxify your skin but leave it super soft, clean and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried A LOT of InstaNatural products and they have all been fantastic so make sure you check out the other reviews on my blog, GlamRiver.  (You can use the search feature and search for InstaNatural to find them).&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Wow with this product you get so much for your money. Like that this product let&#x27;s me make up my own skin care products. First, and most important is it&#x27;s 100% all natural &amp; Organic Seaweed powder. Only one ingredient is in it, and that&#x27;s seaweed kelp which is in powder form. It&#x27;s a pale green color. Honestly it has that sea like smell, and it&#x27;s slightly strong.  Still since this product has strong detoxifying properties I can deal with the scent.  My favorite thing is making a body scrub with seaweed powder, sea salt, olive oil, and if you wish an essential oil of your choice such as sweet orange or almond oil. Mix it together and it should for a creamy like texture. Rub it onto DRY skin. I also made a face mask too. This seaweed really cleans out your pores, and leaves my skin looking fresh, clear &amp; refined. If you wish you can be simple, and just mix it with water, and do masks or scrubs. This tub is a great value, and should last a long time. It has so many uses. Personally I like to add an essential oil to help with the smell, but it&#x27;s just an optional step. Have used other seaweed powder products in the past, but this one from InstaNatural is  top quality, and it&#x27;s a generous amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for free in exchange for a fair &amp; honest review. The thoughts in this review are my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using Instanatural Seaweed Powder for facial masks for a while now &amp; I would love to tell you all about it! This Seaweed powder is great because it’s only ingredient is 100% pure Kelp powder. I love a product that doesn&#x27;t have any crazy harsh chemicals in it,  with this one you know exactly what you’re putting on your skin. Once again I am a licensed Esthetician, so I will explain the benefits of Seaweed Powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Benefits of Seaweed &amp; Seaweed powder:&lt;br /&gt;This seaweed powder can be used for facial masks, cellulite treatment, as well as body wraps, it’s a great source of nutrients &amp; vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detoxifying: Instanatural Seaweed Powder will help draw out impurities in the skin, which will in turn help rejuvenate the overall tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anti Inflammatory: Seaweed has natural anti-inflammatory properties in it, which will help people with over sensitive skin. It will calm everything down and reduce any swelling or puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliating: Seaweed is also a great natural exfoliant, it will help remove excess dead skin cells on the surface and reveal fresh, smooth, young looking skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use this product &amp; my opinions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Instanatural Seaweed Powder as a facial mask and I saw wonderful results immediately. I cleansed my skin normally then I mixed a teaspoon of the seaweed powder with a little honey and some warm water, and applied it to my face, neck, and decollete with a fan brush. I left the seaweed powder mixture on my skin for about 30 minutes. It dries on your skin so removal is a little difficult, but just take your time and be sure not to scrub your skin too vigorously. As soon as i removed the mask my skin was a little pink which is good, it means the blood is to the surface &amp; it will leave you with bright glowing skin! Once my skin dried it was the softest I have ever felt it in a LONG time, the only feeling I can attribute it to is like after getting a Microdermabrasion. My face also felt very firm I joked with my friend that it felt like I got a face lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think the Instanatural Seaweed Powder is amazing. It left my skin feeling soft and firm, and looking bright! The only small downside I found is the smell, it definitely smells from the sea, but that is to be expected since it’s only ingredient is 100% pure kelp powder. On the packaging it actually says if the scent bothers you at all you can add a few drops of an essential oil. Honestly the smell isn&#x27;t THAT bad, once you apply the mask you hardly notice it.&lt;br /&gt;I can’t wait to try this as a body wrap! A word of advice from an Esthetician, if you do use this as a body wrap product, be sure to drink PLENTY of water afterwords since seaweed is so detoxifying! I received this product for evaluation, I never promise a certain review. These are my own honest opinions.mabrasion.

    <li> Great product! I instantly felt its natural healing properties the second I first put it on. Would like to have a liquid form of it for smoother and faster application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to using your product. Have used before and enjoyed its use as a mask for the face. Cellulite is next: detox and cleasing for the legs.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I&#x27;ve done several body wraps and face masks.  I use fractionated coconut oil, and a couple essential oils mixed into a paste. I keep the body wrap on overnight and my skin is always amazingly soft after.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is a face mask.  Evening skin tone, redness, and  helps with any acne. I&#x27;ll add a before and after.  It really is amazing</li>
    <li> Great for body wraps and facial masks</li>
    <li> I just received this this afternoon and already tried a body wrap and face mask. I even got my boyfriend to try a face mask! :) He gave it a thumbs up as well!!! My skin feels amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few treatments. I&#x27;ve already talked friends into looking into getting it. AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> Just want to mention first that I actually paid for this. No promotional price or giveaway. I&#x27;ve made all the recipes for the scrubs and masks that are on the container. I like them, but needed more oil in all cases than was called for in the recipes. I think environmental differences play a factor in how the product sets up, so that&#x27;s probably why. The smell is strong (it really is just seaweed), so I found the mask is a little hard to handle. For me, the scrubs work really well to tighten and brighten my skin. It has improved my skin texture on my arms and legs. There&#x27;s a lot in the container, so it will last a while.</li>
    <li> Awesome, awesome, awesome! I saw results after one application. I have dry sensitive skin so I am always careful of what I put on my face. I loved the fact that the only ingredient in this amazing powder is none other than organic seaweed. Yup, just one ingredient. What is also cool is that you can mix this with other natural and organic if you’ve got them ingredients. I made a facemask the very first day I received it in the mail. It was easy to mix and apply. I’m not going to lie it did have a scent. You know a kelpy scent, but you get over that pretty quickly once your laying down, relaxing and it has had a chance to start drying. I noticed that my pores where smaller and that my skin felt tighter. It was smooth and soft and the redness I had prior to applying had diminished. That must be the results from the anti-inflammatory properties seaweed has. I haven’t tried any of the other suggested uses so I can’t comment on the effects. My face looks brighter and livelier now that I have added InstaNatural Seaweed Kelp Powder to my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> This product container is HUGE and filled to the brim! I&#x27;ve loved other products from Instanatural and so you better believe I was thrilled to try out this one.  I&#x27;ve heard great things about Seaweed Powder in the past and was thrilled to find that all of them were true after using this product.  The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the scent and the need for essential oils in most of the recipes.  I know that seaweed is normally smelly, but the smell seemed to get worse once the masks were made.  However, I was still able to use the product without being completely turned off.  Also, I didn&#x27;t have any essential oils lying around and so it would have been nice to have a recipe without essential oils.  This product made my skin feel nice and smooth and prevented breakouts.  I didn&#x27;t try the body wrap yet, but will definitely try it soon.  Instanatural stands by their products and they always deliver high-quality results.  Try it out, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I have used so many Insta Natural products I don&#x27;t think I can even add them on my hands anymore. I absolutely love this brand of beauty products. When I was given the opportunity to try this seaweed powder for my honest review-I jumped on it! I cannot be happier that I did! First off, the container it comes in is pretty big. It lasts quite a while. I have had it for a few months and I still have quite a bit left. I use it a couple of times a week to treat the cellulite on my legs and breast area and also as a face mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is strong smelling-be clear on that before you buy it. Adding essential oils really helped to tame the scent a little and make it more than bearable. I really enjoyed using this for a mask. I use it twice a week and enjoy the 20 minute, give or take, break I get from the kids, the house, and everything else I&#x27;m dealing with right now. I just add a little water to the powder, I like it thick so the recommended water amount works great. It is thick but dries pretty quickly and washes off easily. After just the first time I used it I noticed a difference. My skin was soft and smooth. I noticed my skin tone has begun to look more even as well which is great since I tend to get red cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on the cellulite on my legs and breast area as I already mentioned and I leave it on for about 20 minutes again. I am so pleased with the results! My skin is left even and smooth and I just make sure to moisturize well after using the powder to ensure I get the best results possible. My skin is starting to tighten and the cellulite is starting to diminish. I can&#x27;t get over how soft my skin is! I love all the pampering my skin has gotten since receiving this seaweed powder and the results I have seen. It lasts a long time and is so worth the money!</li>
    <li> a bit messy but I think helpful.</li>
    <li> This product comes in a huge container. I was really surprised by how much of the product there is. It will definitely last a while, especially considering a little goes a long way. I made a mask for my face with this, using honey and aloe vera gel. I felt like my skin was brighter and clearer after rinsing it off. I am hoping that with repeated use, my enlarged pores and issues with blackheads will be diminished. Product was provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> I received this Seaweed Powder  and it is the best body and facial mask that I have ever used! It comes in a 24 oz. jar (1.5 lbs) and can last you an eternity! I was stunned when I unboxed it and was faced with a HUGE jar because I was honestly expecting a smaller sized package, but I am happy with what I got. InstaNatural’s Seaweed Powder is 100% Natural, Kosher Certified, and Certified Organic by USDA, and Ecocert ICO. 100% natural and freshly harvested seaweed contains a high concentration of vitamins, minerals and iodine that remove impurities from your skin while relieving aches and pains.This powder can be used in a variety of ways; most commonly it can be used for a body wrap treatment to reduce the appearance of cellulite and create a slimming effect. By absorbing excess water and detoxifying the skin, the Seaweed Powder will help to make your body appear more toned, tightened and firmer. Remember though, if you use this product as a body wrap you will lose water in the process so remember to hydrate yourself with plenty of water to replenish what you have lost. When used as a facial mask or scrub, the seaweed will extract toxins and tackle acne and other blemishes, leaving you with a softer and clearer complexion. On the back of the packaging label are three recipes: Cellulite scrub, facial mask, and facial scrub all requiring simple ingredients that can be found at any local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder is green in color and since this is 100% seaweed it does smell like fish. First thing that came to mind was that I was smelling fish food! The scent should not be a problem however, if you mask it with beautiful scents such as lemon oil, and honey. Add what you will to make the unpleasant smell go away and please don&#x27;t avoid this product because of this as this product works amazingly! So go on and add those essential oils to mask the scent then get to business. I made the facial scrub since I had all the ingredients on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial Scrub&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons Seaweed Powder&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;2-4 tablespoons Sea Salt&lt;br /&gt;Mix all ingredients together until it turns into a heavy, thick mixture. Gently rub mixture over face in circular motions.  Rinse off with warm water or use a damp towel if needed. Follow up with a facial oil cleanser (or any facial cleanser). Can be used daily.&lt;br /&gt;Once I washed the scrub off my face I had amazingly soft skin! My face did not feel stripped or harsh at all and it was hydrated. The scrub sloughed off my dead skin and left me with a baby soft face and it was not at all reddened by the scrub. I really like this product!</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions on the container for the seaweed wrap it can help reduce cellulite and make you look thinner. You know those sales reps that try to sale you body wraps to detoxify your body and make you appear thinner? This is can easily be achieved yourself with this seaweed powder and saran wrap.&lt;br /&gt;I used it as a mask, I added water to make a paste like consistency and applied it to my face until it dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to lie, it smells terrible, I mean it IS seaweed. If you add a drop off essential oil into your mixture it will offset the smell and make it more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;As a result of using this my skin felt very soft and smooth and my skin has an overall appearance of being brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This seaweed kelp is so awesome lately ive been having clay parties with about 10buddies and we all use my kelp clay sometimes they even put indian clay to spread it out but were already seeing results and like they say ive got 7buddies that really took to the clay they look totally beautiful and now they think different but that&#x27;s why I have my kelp clay parties cause I love my friends to be very happy with my on line shopping addiction we gotta make the most outa it right and so far all of us are totally addicted to seaweed kelping?? I would totally recommend to everone I know</li>
    <li> This is pretty awesome and it comes with a couple recipes on the container for different skin treatments. It is easily mixed and feels amazing on the skin. It can be messy initially because it is a super fine powder but once you get the powder down a little that will no longer be an issue. This is the 1st time trying seaweed kelp power and I think that with each recipe my skin felt fresh and hydrated.  The scent is a bit strong like fish food but I think it is to be expected as seaweed is the main ingredient. It definitely felt like it was cleaning out my pours. I am going to make a few batches for some friends so they can enjoy it too! I would highly recommend using this for a detoxifying treatment. The one thing I think would make it better is having a scoop available inside the container.  I was sent this for review however it does not effect my thoughts and unbiased opinions.</li>
    <li> I have been using Insta Natural products for the last few months and have seen some good results with a large number of their products.  I recently tried their Dead Sea Mud Mask and just loved it.  So when I was given the opportunity to try their Seaweed Powder, I was for sure up to the challenge.  I will start by saying I have never heard of or ever used a Seaweed Powder product.  So I wasn&#x27;t too sure how I was going to use this product or what benefits it would offer me skincare wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product came in a massive 24oz tube.  The kelp is certified organic and can be used on your skin and hair.  This product comes in a pale green powder form and has no strong smell or odor.  Once mixed with water it turns into a dark greenish color.  I wasn&#x27;t to crazy about the color but hey like I always say &amp;#34;in the name of beauty, you try it all!&amp;#34;  You can find &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34; for this product in mixing it with other ingredients in order to get good results.  You can find this recipe list on the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you mix this with water, you find that the natural scent of seaweed/kelp does arise.  It smells like the beach I will be honest.  It wasn&#x27;t that bad at all.  However I do like the beach smell so for me it worked! I used this product as both a face mask and body scrub and I loved how my skin felt after!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this product is how it works great for your skin! My face felt so tone and smooth after use it and I had no dryness or tight feeling afterwards.  However what I didn&#x27;t like about this product is how messy it can become.  You have to mix your solution in an empty container in order to get this product to work since it is a powder after all.  luckily I had empty containers lying around my house, so I could make more than one use out of them!  I am not to sure how I would of felt had I had to use my pots and eating bowls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, if you use this as a body scrub or body mask; once you wash this off in the shower it can and will become very messy.  Also, if you use this on your body, you can&#x27;t leave your bathroom.  If you sit anywhere you will probably leave green stuff behind on your chairs and beds.  So you have to stay in the bathroom while using this for your body at all times.  So while its a hassle, however you do get personal time for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend at least trying this product out if you are into trying new things like Seaweed and organic Kelp!</li>
    <li> One receives a great deal for the expenditure.  Pure and highly effective.</li>
    <li> I just received mine, and first of all the container is huge! This will last me a very long time. I used it first as a facial mask. I am 35 years old and I have combination skin, as soon as I took it off I could feel and see a big difference. My skin is very dewy and has a wonderful glow. I get spa facials done about every six months, and this has made my face feel just as good as my $120 facials. I can&#x27;t wait to try it to see how it does as a body scrub. I also loved how they give you all the recipes on the container for the different ways to use it. Get this product, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Love it never has my complexion and tone to my skin looked so even or perfect would definitely buy again !</li>
