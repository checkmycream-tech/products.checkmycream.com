      <li>So definitely recommend this product as well as the Seller great price and great purchase.:)</li>
      <li>There are SO many uses for Vasoline that you just cannot go ANYWHERE without having SOME handy.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>so I thought okay</li>
      <li>The price was ok for what I got</li>
      <li>Love it, works for many many things from lip care, hair care, skin care , nail care, foot care.</li>
      <li>Love vaseline.</li>

      <li>I use this product as a make up remover and a aid to have fuller longer lashes i like to keep this little jar in my make up bag its perfect for when travling</li>
      <li>MOST USEFUL TIP:</li>
      <li>I buy cheap wash rags that I use specifically to remove my eye makeup because the mascara does stain them</li>
      <li>But as we know the Vaseline, blue seal is good.   </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t want to ruin my good ones, but Kleenex or toilet tissue works too.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Vaseline is probably the most versatile product on planet Earth, and while it can be used for a myriad of things as described by the countless reviews on this site; I have one use for this product that I have never, nor probably will ever, find a better replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Product is fine - but the price was way too much.</li>
      <li>useful.</li>
      <li>try it for 6 months, see if the smile lines around your eyes soften at all.</li>
      <li>We do have smile lines around the eyes</li>
      <li>try it for 6 months, see if the smile lines around your eyes soften at all.</li>
      <li>Take a bath, use a cotton towel to clean it - DO NOT RUB your body with the towel, gently let the towel absorb the water, immediately apply the moisturizer.</li>
      <li>the picture should be more clear for the product and more information, sometime it&#x27;s not look the same as in the picture.</li>
      <li>Sure it might be part biology (genes), but my sister doesn&#x27;t use Vaseline and hasn&#x27;t had the same results that I have, or my mother....</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m just saving the rest of it for chapstick and first aid.</li>
      <li>The European Union has banned many petroleum jelly products, and experts are concerned they could be linked to cancer.</li>
      <li>Others make my eyelids (top and bottom) red, dry/scaly and unbearably itchy after prolonged use.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, it worked like a charm.</li>
      <li>No matter how much I wander, I always come back to good old vaseline.</li>
      <li>The plastic flip top is a huge improvement over the previous style lid.</li>
      <li>And to be honest it takes everything off quickly without any harsh rubbing unlike a lot of eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Vaseline, it&#x27;s pretty much what you would expect.</li>
      <li>I put this on my feet after my shower at night, put on a pair of sock and my feet stay super soft and smooth the next day!</li>
      <li>I have noticed by using Vaseline to remove my eye make up, and something that is a huge benefit in my humble opinion, is that it&#x27;s moisturizing properties have been a HUGE factor in my lack of crows feet.</li>
      <li>so I firmly believe that this stuff is amazing for your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My mother and I both don&#x27;t really have crows feet.</li>
      <li>keeps my skin hydrated and wrinkles at bey...and VERY inexpensive</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I consider Vaseline my way to avoid having to use anti-aging products that usually never work anyway.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Steer clear of any products that list petroleum jelly or mineral oil on the ingredient list.  </li>
      <li>People were quite surprised when I showed them how effortless it was to gently rub a double pea size amount of this over your lashes and eye lid.</li>
      <li>I use this a night around my sensitive eyes...</li>
      <li>I take a dab, massage it onto my eyelids, let sit for a few seconds, take a baby wipe and wipe clean.</li>
      <li>This also arrived a few days earlier than expected, which was nice.</li>
      <li>firmly believe that using Vaseline has made a difference having fine lines at my age vs. deep lines.</li>
      <li>The top fits on firmly so there is little risk of accidents.</li>
      <li>Not a single friend or acquaintance</li>
      <li>One is to put on my lips before bed, the other is my main use which is as eye makeup remover.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have to review these, since I am here, I might as well. Vaseline petroleum jelly is a great product. Excellent to hold the moisture in your body. The only problem with petroleum jelly is that it clogs the pores - not just this product but any petroleum jelly. So, I would not suggest the use on the face. For the rest of your body, this is a great product. Especially, arms/legs/hands/feet. But if your body has pores, as some people do, I would just stick with a moisturizer.     MOST USEFUL TIP: Any moisturizer works great if applied right after a bath, this helps to hold the moisture in our body and this is the right way to use a moisturizer. Take a bath, use a cotton towel to clean it - DO NOT RUB your body with the towel, gently let the towel absorb the water, immediately apply the moisturizer. You will see a lot of difference.</li>
    <li> Best for dry areas, itchy spots and most importantly will heal chapped lips in hours!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Vaseline, it&#x27;s pretty much what you would expect. 3.75 oz might have been a bit smaller than I envisioned, but it is what it is</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with such a simple product. Great.</li>
    <li> I use this for two things. One is to put on my lips before bed, the other is my main use which is as eye makeup remover. I have tried like fifteen different eye makeup removers and this is the only one my eyes can tolerate long term. Others make my eyelids (top and bottom) red, dry/scaly and unbearably itchy after prolonged use. But not this. I take a dab, massage it onto my eyelids, let sit for a few seconds, take a baby wipe and wipe clean. And to be honest it takes everything off quickly without any harsh rubbing unlike a lot of eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Love vaseline. Versatile. Use it on everything. You should try putting it on your eyelashes before bed, I wake up with full beautiful lashes!</li>
    <li> I recently moved into a new apartment and my front door was sticking like crazy. My mom recommended rubbing some vaseline along the edges of the door, so I hopped on my Amazon Prime and made my purchase. Sure enough, it worked like a charm. My front door no longer sticks! Now I&#x27;m just saving the rest of it for chapstick and first aid. What CAN&#x27;T vaseline do??</li>
    <li> Why I choose this rating is because I never used petroleum jelly before but after hearing all the wonderful uses for it I had to buy it and I had an amazon gift card so I thought okay and it really works because I live in a really cold environment and my hands are always dry. So definitely recommend this product as well as the Seller great price and great purchase.:)</li>
    <li> For the price I thought it would be lorger.</li>
    <li> My local stores only carried their stores brands. And those are slightly different. And that difference is enough for me to choose Vaseline brand instead. I use this for chapped areas and my lashes. I ordered 2 items from Amazon on the same day. The other came in within 3-5 days and this Vaseline arrived almost 2 weeks later. Hope I can find it again at my local stores next time. I would like to avoid the long wait and shipping fee.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s vaseline alright, I touched it myself!  It feels like vaseline, smells like vaseline, is slippery like vaseline, tastes like vaseline, gets stuck on stuff like vaseline, does everything it&#x27;s suposed too, even gushes about!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good I give this product a five star rating&lt;br /&gt;But the picture should be more clear for the product and more information, sometime it&#x27;s not look the same as in the picture.</li>
    <li> This was a total ripoff. Not only did they send me the wrong product they charged me much more than what I would pay at a brick and mortar place. Skip the Candy store!</li>
    <li> I use this product as a make up remover and a aid to have fuller longer lashes i like to keep this little jar in my make up bag its perfect for when travling</li>
    <li> I paid a lot more than store price! Product is fine - but the price was way too much. Will never buy from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Who actually uses this product??? Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petroleum jelly is a byproduct of oil drilling, and when you spread it on your lips, you end up eating it, which is essentially the same as drinking gasoline. Add up the amount of lip-gloss the average woman uses (and consumes) over a decade, and it equals 7 pounds. The European Union has banned many petroleum jelly products, and experts are concerned they could be linked to cancer. Women with breast cancer have twice the levels of hydrocarbons (substances found in petroleum jelly) in their breasts than women who haven&#x27;t had breast cancer. Steer clear of any products that list petroleum jelly or mineral oil on the ingredient list.  ~~~Dr. Oz</li>
    <li> Vaseline is probably the most versatile product on planet Earth, and while it can be used for a myriad of things as described by the countless reviews on this site; I have one use for this product that I have never, nor probably will ever, find a better replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I use Vaseline to remove my eye make up. I have used Vaseline to remove my eye make up since I was a teenager and just starting out w/mascara and eye liner/shadows. My mother used it, so that&#x27;s what I used too.&lt;br /&gt;I never knew it was a strange concept to people until I was a bit older and started talking \\&quot;shop\\&quot; with other women about their makeup removal routine. Not a single friend or acquaintance I had used Vaseline. People were quite surprised when I showed them how effortless it was to gently rub a double pea size amount of this over your lashes and eye lid. The make up comes off very easily. Of course you look like a raccoon when you&#x27;re done but it comes off very easily with tissue or a wash rag. I buy cheap wash rags that I use specifically to remove my eye makeup because the mascara does stain them and I don&#x27;t want to ruin my good ones, but Kleenex or toilet tissue works too.&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed by using Vaseline to remove my eye make up, and something that is a huge benefit in my humble opinion, is that it&#x27;s moisturizing properties have been a HUGE factor in my lack of crows feet. My mother and I both don&#x27;t really have crows feet. We do have smile lines around the eyes but they are very very minimal considering our ages. My mother is 60 and I am 37.&lt;br /&gt;I firmly believe that using Vaseline has made a difference having fine lines at my age vs. deep lines. Sure it might be part biology (genes), but my sister doesn&#x27;t use Vaseline and hasn&#x27;t had the same results that I have, or my mother....so I firmly believe that this stuff is amazing for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;So my review on Vaseline is for the amazing benefits for your skin this provides. I consider Vaseline my way to avoid having to use anti-aging products that usually never work anyway.&lt;br /&gt;My advice- try it for 6 months, see if the smile lines around your eyes soften at all. I bet it would at the very least halt any deepening of the lines you might already have.nti-aging products that usually never work anyway.&lt;br /&gt;My advice- try it for 6 months, see if the smile lines around your eyes soften at all. I bet it would at the very least halt any deepening of the lines you might already have.</li>
    <li> The plastic flip top is a huge improvement over the previous style lid. This is one of the products everyone needs to have around.</li>
    <li> I use this a night around my sensitive eyes...keeps my skin hydrated and wrinkles at bey...and VERY inexpensive...highly recommend this product...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was a kid! Vaseline is great for so many things. Dry skin, chapped lips, minor cuts and scraps. I use this as a makeup remover, on my lips and as an overnight foot mask. I put this on my feet after my shower at night, put on a pair of sock and my feet stay super soft and smooth the next day! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This us great product. My son is attending college in NY and this his preferred product for prevention of dry, chapped skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use it for everything and its a great for chapped lips . Put it on your lips before night time and you are sure to never have chapped lips again</li>
    <li> Come on people its Vaseline the awesome quality is everything you would expect from this company.  The size is for those people on the go who want to carry this while traveling or after a workout at the gym. This is perfect for manageing dry skin while out and about.  This small sized Vaseline fits easily in a purse, breifcase of small man bag. The top fits on firmly so there is little risk of accidents. The price was ok for what I got so it is five stars on value.</li>
    <li> Does whatever you want it to do. No problems, complaints, criticisms or questions. Not sure the care is &amp;#34;intensive&amp;#34; though.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints. It&#x27;s vaseline. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. This also arrived a few days earlier than expected, which was nice.</li>
    <li> No matter how much I wander, I always come back to good old vaseline. Honestly, if people are still buying it today then Vaseline should be doing something right. Love it, works for many many things from lip care, hair care, skin care , nail care, foot care. Also a good lubricant and a great make up remover, to mention a few.</li>
    <li> nice. useful. This is too expensive for a 3.75 oz. it is in a very small container. ridiculous price. But as we know the Vaseline, blue seal is good.   go to walmart</li>
    <li> what&#x27;s not to love of this?</li>
    <li> There are SO many uses for Vasoline that you just cannot go ANYWHERE without having SOME handy.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great for GREASE, in a pinch, and you never know when you need to grease a burn&lt;br /&gt;OR a gasket!</li>
    <li> I bought this to put between my thighs when I run. It does a great job of preventing chafing. It&#x27;s also good as a general-purpose skin moisturizer!</li>
    <li> And who doesn&#x27;t need Vasoline petroleum for their dry lip, hands and feet.  The best moisturizer and protector.</li>
</ol>
