<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a big fan of clay and believe in its healing benefits.  My last experience with natural clay was in Costa Rica where I experienced some hot springs and natural clay masks.  So after being a believer in the health benefits of clay, I was so glad to try this product.  The Bentnonite Clay did not disappoint. It took a few tries to get clay consistency just right. I also used slightly warmer to hot water as I like the clay to be a warm texture.  I used the clay immediately after mixing and it went on smoothly.  After I rinsed it off, my skin felt clean and soft.  It felt like toxins were taken off.  It also opened my pores which was great to then hydrate my skin using my favorite moisturizer.    This product was received for review purposes and my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> its better then any clay I tried before will buy again</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL BUT HARD TO WORK WITH</li>
    <li> I like this product because it seems to really clean out my pores.  The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is having to mix my own each time I want to use it.  I guess it can&#x27;t be helped with the type of product it is.  It would probably dry out if it came premixed, but I&#x27;m lazy and would use it more often if I didn&#x27;t have to do this step.</li>
    <li> The mask mixed very easily and spreads on nice. My skin feels soft and clean. My daughter loves getting girly facial time so this was by far her favorite. It dries fast and rinsed off easily.</li>
    <li> This is the best mask I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Used this yesterday evening still feels great this morning</li>
    <li> Its ok mask&lt;br /&gt;I have been usen it for a month, havent seen any results yet</li>
    <li> Opened this one up, and the stench was absolutely disgusting. I could barely stand it; I doubt I&#x27;ll be using it now!</li>
    <li> Love this. The fact its powder caught me off guard, since I was always used to just putting it right on out of the container, but it works great and rubs off easy. My face felt amazing afterwards</li>
    <li> Use the product and noticed my pores the next day had little whiteheads coming out of them. No pimples but seems that it took all the black kids off of my face. Liked it</li>
    <li> Too messy and tedious to mix up. I end up with massive clumps and not a smooth clay mask no matter what I try. I&#x27;ll leave this to the pros and stick with my premixed facials. Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck.</li>
    <li> Like yo use weekly with apple cider vinegar for the deep pore cleaning. A little goes a long way. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love masks and a love making stuff so I got both with this Azteca Gold healing clay which I was offered at a promotional discount for my personal use and unbiased review  This is quality bentonite clay. For the mask I used 2 tablespoons of bentonite clay and between 1-2 table spoons apple cider vinegar. I definitely recommend using the ACV for the smooth consistency you want. It feels very cool going on and it washes of easily. I immediately noticed smoother tighter skin. My pores were tight and clean. I have combination skin so when I put the mask on I used it a little thicker in my T - zone area. I really like the fact that you can mix it your self so it will last a lot longer and will not dry out like other pre mixed masks.</li>
    <li> This is extremely messy. You mix it with water but it gets all over the place. However,  it did clean face well.</li>
    <li> Just used it a few times. It does clean and tight my facial skin, but it is difficult to mix evenly.</li>
    <li> great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have only used this clay mask just once since I just received it. I must say I love it. Very easy to mix. My face looked and felt devine after washing it off. I look forward to using it again.</li>
    <li> So refreshing and clarifying for skin!&lt;br /&gt;I had the chance to purchase this mask with a discount coupon. I&#x27;m writing my review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I often have acne that comes and goes with more humid weather. This mask really helps with reducing the blackheads that lead to my acne. I&#x27;ve noticed this effect when starting to use this mask in wintertime, when blackheads aren&#x27;t so noticeable. Now that it&#x27;s summer, it seems to really help with the clogged pores. I put is on after a hot shower, wait about 10 minutes, then rinse it off in my sink. Really great for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this mask to anyone wanting clearer, healthier skin.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy for the discounted price i paid. I wasnt thrilled that i had to actually mix and make the mask, but once i used it i was happy. It made my skin feel fresh and clean. I have sensitive skin and it did not dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> Only product I&#x27;ve found to remove blackheads and I&#x27;ve used proactive for years</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought a jar of this Bentonite Clay.  After hearing her talk about how wonderful her skin felt after using it I figured I might give it a try.  She works nights as a nurse so I started using it on nights she was at work.  Boy she wasn&#x27;t kidding.  I&#x27;ve only used this clay a few times so far but this stuff is awesome.  My skin feels tighter and better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> I am not new to this product as in Pakistan it&#x27;s called as Multani Mitti and has been used for ages by women for beautiful skin .  The only difference is back home it is for less than a dollar :)</li>
    <li> I opened this and was a little bit skeptical because it&#x27;s in powder form. I was not sure what to expect but after getting through the whole thing I loved it. As I mentioned it&#x27;s a powder you mix with water to get the wet clay. I had to use more water than suggested to even get it pliable enough to slather on my face. It took a a couple of minutes to find the right amount of water and then you have to wait 10 minutes before applying to your face. Applying it was a bit of a struggle at because I have darker skin so I couldn&#x27;t tell if I was applying enough until it started to dry. When It was time to rinse I realized I could not do it with water alone as suggested, the material was just shifting on my face instead of coming off. I had to use a cloth. Now I know the whole review sounded like complaining but here is why I gave it 5 stars. I had two pimples on my face. They were red and raised. The morning after I did this mask they were gone. I wanted to be sure it was from the mask so I waited until I had another one. I spot masked only the pimple and the next morning it was gone. The result was well worth the trial and error of mixing and applying.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of masks over the years. I can tell you if you want a mask that not only you feel it tighten you can see results pick this one. This mask pulls so tight. I personally loved it. I felt the impurities and toxins getting pulled out. It is super thick and I did this when I had a get away. I used their towel as I was worried it would stain my towels. I can not say if it will but heck it is so worth it. I will warn you not to laugh it does pull a lot. I am so glad I ran into this brand and product. It is has been said Bentonite clay is one of the best around. It is said to be safe for all skin types. I personally have combination skin sometimes more oily in summer and drier in the winter. I can say my results with some acne skin have been great. Not only is it great for women but men too. It helps pull out the junk in your skin. By putting in radiant glow luscious skin. Make sure you spread this out through your neck and into your decollete. Don&#x27;t forget this area it will show aging just like the face. Another place to think about is your hands. It is said that if you want to see an age of someone look at the neck/chest or hands. That is a part most people do not think about. I do highly suggest this for men. I know men might say huh well it is great I can tell your our skin will feel so soft after using this.  As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Bought for the wife and she loved it. She said the clay is very fresh and easy to use with no stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;It washes off easily and makes her skin feel fresh and young again.</li>
    <li> I really felt the cleansing power of the Azteca gold healing clay. It tightened my skin on my face and fell very good. My skin felt fresher and cleaner after I tried my first treatment.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite.  It&#x27;s messy and clumpy.  This is my first mask where I had to mix the powder myself and I prefer the premixed.  After having the mask on for less then 10 minutes it gets really uncomfortably stiff and hard on my face.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks, and my cystic acne has faded quite a bit. I get big, deep, painful red bumps, and since I started using this, they&#x27;ve gotten smaller and less frequent. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel overly dry, either. I hope it keeps working!</li>
    <li> I love this clay mask. It tightens my pores and leaves my skin very smooth</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife. I received the item very quickly, and my wife has already used it once. She loves it!</li>
    <li> It is healing.Good for the skin.</li>
    <li> The best mud mask I have ever used!!! This mask that leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed...as a gift for my wife. and i ended up sing it too. . . Needless to say WE LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This mask made my face feel amazing. I mixed it as directed, and let it set for the 5 minutes. It was easy to put the mask on, and to smooth it all over. I had my kids take some pictures while the mask was on but there is no way those are going up! The mask doesn&#x27;t look as thick as it does in the picture, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be. The amount that they suggest is perfect. It was easy to take off when it was time, it took about a minute. Before I put the mask on, my skin was oily, and very red. After I took the mask off, my skin felt normal, not dry, not oily. Also the redness had gone away! That&#x27;s a huge plus for me, living in humid South Carolina, my face seems to always be red. Hours later, my skin is still feeling great. Smooth, non oily, and not red! I recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this product in the mail after reading all of the reviews.  I even applied it immediately after opening the package.  I mixed according to the directions and allowed the suggested time for the mask to sit.  I started breaking out the next day, as well as the day following.  I thought it may just be because it was a new product.. So I waited about 2 more days and tried  again. I broke out again.  Little whiteheads in several regions on my face (cheek, in between eyebrows).  Not very happy. I read it was good for sensitive skin, but it wasn&#x27;t good for me.  I</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive and acne prone skin therefore I am a little apprehensive about using products on my face.  However, I am always up for trying new products to improve the look of my skin as I age. Because I have acne, I used it with organic apple cider as recommended. After trying, Now the Best Bentonite Healing Clay, it truly did everything it promised and did not irritate my skin, create redness, or a rash. It left my skin feeling healthy, rejuvenated, silky and smooth.  I would recommend this product to my friends and family, it is amazing! Although I got this product for free or discounted price,  I ensure that my thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
    <li> Left my face feeling smooth and soft like a baby&#x27;s bottom!!!! Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the Bentonite Clay mask a few times now and it&#x27;s so simple to use. It comes as a powder in the container and all you do is add water and apply to your face. You&#x27;ll notice a tightening feeling after applying and results are wonderful! I noticed smaller pore size and it helped control the oily appearance on my face.</li>
    <li> This is a great mud mask clay product. I have used it now three times and each time my skin feels so much tighter and looks much more youthful and radiant. Great product and by the way great price.</li>
    <li> I like how my face feels after using this. It&#x27;s clean if you get me. I use it in my hair as well. It&#x27;s a small container so I couldn&#x27;t use as much as I&#x27;m used to but I&#x27;ve always liked this clay. Delivery was fast and the supplier contacted me to ensure item was recieved.</li>
    <li> Products is great but it&#x27;s just messy to prepare and mix it, I works rather have something that&#x27;s  ready to apply</li>
    <li> Good cleaning ability and reduced my blackhead.</li>
    <li> I like it very much,because it is very suited for me.I think,next time.I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use my coat mask at night before bed. It makes my face feel so fresh and clean. I love the feeling of the clay drying on my face likes its just detoxicifying my skin instantly.</li>
    <li> Great Bentonite Clay&lt;br /&gt;I love using this clay with apple cider vinegar. I feel it really helps detox my skin during monthly breakouts or when I notice too many clogged pores. My skin is a bit red after I gently wash off the mask, but shortly after, my skin is left with a gorgeous glow. Like I got a Vitamin C peel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-2 tbs vinegar for 2 tbs clay (depends on your consistency preference).&lt;br /&gt;Too thick tightens the skin way too much. The great part: your skin will feel tightened regardless of how watery. I try to keep my face relaxed so the clay dries evenly and Does Not tug on my skin in odd angles. I would definitely recommend this product to others. I based this with my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Great mask, skin feels so smooth after using this.</li>
    <li> Great mud mask, i really love how my skin feels after using it and it has reduced my pore size dramaticaly, highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Thank you, very great mask.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time....a little hard to adjust amount to use</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says. I love that you can actually see the impurities coming out the more you use it you will notice less impurities. I can&#x27;t say that the texture of my skin changed dramatically but I do feel very clean,</li>
    <li> This mask does everything it claims to do. It lifts and decreases lines. Apply a light moisturizer after using, as it really pulls the oils out of your skin. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I recieved as an opportunity to try. I will have to say I totally love this stuff. Made me feel so refreshed after using. Even the toddler daughter wanted to try it!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and the tightening effect is great. It takes such a tiny amount to mix with water to cover the areas of the face that need covering. Overall, it feels good and it does a good job of cleaning out the pores, but make sure you do not put it around the sensitive eye area. The cheekbone is as high as you need to go.</li>
    <li> It comes in the powder form. You mix with the water and apply on the face for 15 minutes. It is great for the acne. It makes my skin, soft, clean and smooth. It was my first time trying any clay mask so I was little scared but it worked amazingly. The mask is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I got this product to give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> what a nice treat for my tired skin! this really drew out the impurities out of my pores and felt amazing like being at the spa! highly recommend! so glad i was given the opportunity to try for free for testing and review purposes!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I used this clay on my face as soon as I received it and the results were unbelievable. Great product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not too sure as I haven&#x27;t figured out just how to regulate the mix.</li>
    <li> Going to have a Girls night out Saturday evening and look forward to being a mashed women....Arrived in record time.</li>
    <li> I received and tried this clay mask and it did  make my skin soft and reduced some of my lines around my mouth and around the brows. Just  don&#x27;t use it around your eyes but you can also use it on your neck. Let the mask dry around 15 minutes, then wash it with warm water , use a toner and then your favorite cream. I will try again for 30 days and see. So far it worked on me.Also good if you have acne or blemishes.</li>
    <li> Excellent product , very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;After a week my chin , previously full of ugly acne blackheads , is smooth&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order again</li>
    <li> I got this product Free to give my honest unbiased opinion. So here it is, This comes in a powder form &amp; you just mix it with water and apply on the face for 15 minutes. It made my skin, soft, clean and smooth. I was a little skeptical before using it but it worked Great &amp; left my skin looking healthy!</li>
    <li> The Healing Clay was A Gift to My mom. This Shipping was Fast &amp; the Packaging Was Great. The Clay Comes in a cute Bottel (2oz)  You Mix 1/2 Tsp of Clay With 1Tsp of Water, wait 5 Minutes for the Clay to Absorb The Water,Apply To Your Face 😊. My Mother Said &amp;#34;Her Skin Feels Refreshed&amp;#34;  Azteca Gold Healing Clay Helps Reduce the The appearance of blemishes &amp; draws out oil.  Gold healing Clay also stimulates bloodflow. My mom did not experience any redness or rashes to her skin. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</li>
    <li> Excellent Face Mask!! My skin feels so refreshed and clean after each use! I would suggest using this product no more than once a week. Really deep cleaned my pores and I could feel it helping the elasticity of my skin. Does get tight as it dries but it&#x27;s totally worth it! *sample provided for review*</li>
    <li> Use it twice a week.  I mix apple cider, baking soda, honey and a couple drops of tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Love any kind of mask especially clay.  It is a mess to make but so worth it in the end.</li>
    <li> This is my second time to buy this product, and I notice less redness and acne with it.</li>
    <li> Makes my face red for a while after use. Definitely increases blood flow!</li>
    <li> This is a really great mask that will for sure leave your face feeling clean, smooth and refreshed! A little bit goes a long way and it will last you quite a while! I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the benefits this mask will give my skin (less breakouts) and I love that it&#x27;s 100% bentonite clay. This will definitely be a staple for me!</li>
    <li> mask is wonderful. skin smooth and refreshed looking</li>
    <li> My skin is always needing some kind of help and healing so I am willing to try anything to help my skin. So when I was offered this Benzonite Healing Clay for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it I definitely ordered a jar. I tried it on my arm to make sure I didn&#x27;t react to the clay and all was good. I mixed it and applied to my face. It stayed on for around 10-15 minutes which is the recommended time and I washed it off and patted dry. My skin is so dang soft and I didn&#x27;t react to it clay on my face seeing as the skin is more sensitive. I recommend this Azteca Gold Healing Clay for anyone who wants soft healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this product but it really let&lt;br /&gt;me down. The clay does not mix well. The product doesn&#x27;t come with full instructions. If it wasn&#x27;t because I came onto Amazon to leave my review I would of done it all wrong, well I did do it wrong at first. You&#x27;re not suppose to mix in a metal bowl, only ceramic, silicone or plastic. Why doesn&#x27;t it come with instructions that say the exact directions.... Then I retried it following the directions on Amazon, and it still was a waste. It doesn&#x27;t turn into a clay and stays lumpy. Doesn&#x27;t look like anything in the pictures. And after about a minute with it on, my face felt insanely itchy and I had to take it off, which was very hard to do since it&#x27;s so lumpy on your face and not smooth. This product was a waste for me. (I received this product discounted for my honest unbiased review)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this clay. I have tried others that have not left me with the clean, refreshed feeling that the azteca gold does. I use once or twice a week as a mask on my face. It has shrunk my pores down drastically and I haven&#x27;t had to use facial toners while using this. Love love love this clay and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have an oily T-zone, and large pores on my nose. This mask does a great job of making my skin feel fresh and tighter.  Here&#x27;s how I use it: I put some of the healing clay into a plastic zip lock bag and mix it with enough rose water to make it a paste. Then I mix it in the zip lock bag, cut one of the corners when it&#x27;s the right consistency, and squeeze out the clay and apply it to my face. Then I simply throw the plastic bag away - no mess!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, the clay is really fine and mixes with water well. If you want it thicker you can add less water.&lt;br /&gt;It went on really smoothly, if you mix it well there wont be big chunks. I left it in until it dried out and washed it away with a warm washcloth. My fave felt so smooth! My skin was a little red afterwards but that went away. One product I&#x27;d used before made my face itchy and I was a bit nervous about that, but no itch, just lovely skin!&lt;br /&gt;According to the packaging you need 20-25 minutes of prep and then application. That&#x27;s a long time. I don&#x27;t know how many people want to wait 10 minutes for the water to absorb, I definitely didn&#x27;t and it seemed fine with just 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this product but mixing it and waiting isn&#x27;t something I want to do. I&#x27;d rather just have it ready. But I&#x27;ll definitely use this when I have more time in my schedule&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion</li>
    <li> I got this threw the elite club to review and I really enjoy this product. It makes my face itch a little while one but once I wash it off my face is really soft.</li>
    <li> I love it and my tweens love it....</li>
    <li> WOW! I LOVE this product! I was a bit hesitant and have used the well known &amp;#34;Hollywood Glam&amp;#34; purchased at Sephora and this tops it! YES! I&#x27;m shocked. It left my skin with a nice glow and a bit red, but Im also very sensitive. The red wasnt anything that I couldnt go out in public. More of a rosey glow. Recommended to my friends. GREAT BUY!</li>
    <li> I originally was very upset over my first order getting lost in the mail over the long weekend, but upon bringing this up with Amazon, they took care of it and after waiting a couple more days, I was able to receive the product and finally try it out. Although I&#x27;ve only used it once, my skin feels really well-nourished and smooth right after washing off the mask. To give you guys more of a background, I have sensitive, combination skin, with dry skin but still an oily T-zone and this product hasn&#x27;t broken me out as of yet! I&#x27;ve been getting a few persistent cysts on my cheek for the last 6 months, but this mask so far as at least stopped new ones from developing and stopped the pain in my active cysts upon first use. Can&#x27;t wait to try using this clay mask again tonight and hope to see great results as I continue using this on a weekly basis! I only tried this once, but I had issues mixing the clay powder and water into a smooth consistency, but I didn&#x27;t realize you&#x27;re supposed to let the powder absorb the water for 10 min before applying it onto your face--will try and hopefully see better consistency this time around!</li>
    <li> Left my skin feeling so soft and refreshed! Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I mixed the clay with a little water to make a mask.  After rinsing my face, my skin felt so nice and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I loved how this made my skin feel</li>
    <li> I received my Bentonite Clay 3 days ago. It is very easy to use and mix up by adding water. I have sensitive skin so i tried just a small area first. I could immediately feel the clay tingling and tightening. After my test area went well i applied it to my entire face. Afterwards my skin felt great and firmer. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for firmer looking skin.</li>
    <li> I cannot get the texture right.  It&#x27;s like a liquid in some areas and clumps of clay in other areas.  What am I doing wrong??  But it works just fine and did not cause any breakouts on my skin.  I will use this once a week.  But, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
