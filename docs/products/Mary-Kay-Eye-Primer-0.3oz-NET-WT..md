      <li>This is not the first time I have bought this product</li>

      <li>I then heard about eye primer and thought I would try MK first since I have a MK rep.  </li>
      <li>It makes my eyeshadow blend and stay put properly and look better</li>
      <li>It really does keep your eyeshadow fresh and from creasing on your eyelids.  </li>

      <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t feel silky and smooth; it feels heavy and draggy when you put it on.</li>

    <li> material received as I expect</li>
    <li> I bought this primer looking for something more cheap than UD but with the same results,i have to say i was a little bit dissapointed cause is much more small and if u have oily lids and live in a hot,humid place like i do (Caribbean), this primer its not good for u,after 2 hours my eyeshadows crease and it looked so awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose this would work for dry lid or skin but i dont recommend for oily lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for years and havent found a better one. It works just as well as the Urban Decay primer and its way cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for five years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it!  It really does keep your eyeshadow fresh and from creasing on your eyelids.  The price on Amazon is about 50% less than if you bought from the Mary Kay website.  In this economy, who doesn&#x27;t like saving money???</li>
    <li> I bought this product through a mary kay rep. I can&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t keep my eyeshadow on (as does even the cheapest of eye primers), but it DID NOTHING to stop my eyeshadow from creasing. Ill never buy again.  Those that have tried a good eye primer will be able to tell the difference for sure!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay eye primer works to keep eye-shadow on so you look great all day.  I enjoy it and the price so if you need one this is a great choice for the price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would. Didn&#x27;t keep my eye shadow or liner off of my eye lid or up by my brow bone.</li>
    <li> I very much enjoy this product! It has a good consistency, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyelids, and preserves my eye makeup throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be the price for such a small tube, but I&#x27;m still new to the online makeup world and perhaps it&#x27;s more reasonable than I think.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It keeps eyeliner, eye shadow anything in place. Well worth every penny and the bottle lasts forever!!</li>
    <li> I love my primer! Helps keep my eyeshadow as it was on application, all day and evening. If you have oily skin you know how oils breakdown eyeliner and shadow...not with eyeprimer!! great price on amazon!!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that can help me wear eye shadow all day. My eyelids are so oily, and without the eye primer, the eye shadow settles into the creases of my eyelids by lunch time.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I have bought this product so I knew what the product should have been like in advance.  I also bought another primer in town at a beauty supply and it was very nice but had little crumbly bits in it.  The Mary Kay primer on the other hand was not as thick, and very, very smooth! It dries nice and fast yet doesn&#x27;t fade out and grabs the color nicely. It makes my eyeshadow blend and stay put properly and look better (solid coloring  When I do not use the primer certain non-mary kay eyeshadows that I have seem to fade when I put them on and the color is not as accurate to the palette.  I love Mary Kay primer!  Will buy again from this seller, shipped very fast and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> didn’t quiet keep my make up from smudging as described. my make up lasted only a little bit longer with the primer than without</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay products, but this was a complete let down. It comes out really runny, and you have to wait a decent amount of time for it to dry (tried putting it on very, very thin as well.) It doesn&#x27;t set down a nice base layer, or base tone. It reminded me a lot of just a lotion. It doesn&#x27;t hold the eye shadow in place. Be prepared for all kinds of eye shadow creases.</li>
    <li> Thats all i have to say! I love it. but this thing is making me write more. so..its better than that</li>
    <li> Still get eyeshadow creases...might as well not use it...try another product as in my opinion, this one does not work as it should.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use to get this from my rep. but she move so I search it on amazon and found it, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it for awhile, it ready does the job for me, I use to get creases in my eye shadow, not anymore.</li>
    <li> Its a good primer for make up and intensify the color, good quality, and perfect to carry on your purse</li>
    <li> I have used this primer for years and love how it help eye make up go on smoother and last all day.</li>
    <li> I really love this product - I tend to have oily eyelids and my makeup was always wearing off it drives me crazy! I was never a fan of anything Mary Kay - But after reading all the positive reviews on this product I decided to try and so glad I did - It is easy to apply and when it is set on my lid I go over it with setting powder- Keeps my eyeshadow on for hours and hours and it does not wear off or run or smudge as it has been doing in the past - I highly recommend this product for anyone who has trouble with oily eyelids...</li>
    <li> goes on easily and smooths the eyelid for application of eye shadow.  As a plus eye makup stays on throughout the day until you remove it.  Highly recommend this product for anyone who wears eye shadow.</li>
    <li> I was supposed to receive two of this product, according to the advertisement, but only received one.  Did I misread it, or did you forget to give me the second one????  Works great.... just wish I&#x27;d gotten what I thought I was paying for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shannon Little&lt;br /&gt;brookeyldn@aol.com</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It is great for deep set eyes to keep the shadow and liner exactly where you placed it originally!  Some days I just use it alone as a highlighter to perk up my eyes when I am on the run and have no time for eye make-up</li>
    <li> I like very much this product and it does the work as good as the most expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Great base coat for eye makeup.  My liner and shadow NEVER run.  I use it everyday ~ it&#x27;s non-greasy and it stays put.  I&#x27;ve used MK Eye Primer for about ten years.  Have no reason to look at any other products.  Shipped in two days too!!  I wrote this review maybe a year ago...and nothing has changed!   I will continue to reorder.   😉</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and works better for me than anything else I have tried. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This eye primer works great! This the only eye primer I use. Eye shadow stays all day and it does not crease.</li>
    <li> I have tried other eye primers and nothing compares to this one.  My eye shadow stays on all day and it doesn&#x27;t crease.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful, and i loved it. Good choise&lt;br /&gt;very good, erverhing is good&lt;br /&gt;i love the purchage..very very  very good&lt;br /&gt;ervethings is good, very beautiful, wonderfull</li>
    <li> I love it!!! It&#x27;s great 👍</li>
    <li> I seriously love this stuff.  Before I found out about it, my eyeshadow did not last but more than a few hours.  It would gunk up and crease.  Now, I put it on in the morning and my eyes still pop when I get home from work.  It is worth every penny and will always be a part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I have used this since it became available, and before that I used triple action eye enhancer since it was made available.  My eyeshadow always stays on from morning until night, and I am often asked how I get it to stay that way.  The only answer I have to give is this product.</li>
    <li> Really love this , used this after I caught the flu . Normally my eye lids are extremly moist , so when I caught the flu , they were really bad ! Used this and it really helped !! I use Loreal Infallible eye shadow with this and so far great , lasted long enough with my eyes watering real bad , oooh 4 hours or so . Not bad !! My only complaint , the picture is very decieving , as it looked to me that I was going to get 2 boxes instead of one  , that why I gave this only 4 stars . Might want to update the picture sometime .</li>
    <li> this primer is ok I notice that at the end of the day my eye shadow looks runny. I am not sure if it&#x27;s because I have oily skin.</li>
    <li> i like this product but wish it would hold the color on for a bit longer will look for some that will not fade away</li>
    <li> I have used Mary K since I was a teenager and now well into my 50&#x27;s it is still an amazing product and now to be able to get it from Amazon.....Wondabar</li>
    <li> Aids in keeping eyeliner and eye shadow on eyes.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this product from my MK rep.  I have been happy with other MK products and was anticipating that this would be a success.  I was wrong.  I had purchased some eye shadow (not cheap and inexpensive ones) from another company and Love the colors, but noticed that it was creasing after a couple hours, bummer! I then heard about eye primer and thought I would try MK first since I have a MK rep.  Anyway, I did as directed and it just did not help.  I needed something that would hold up for several hours and this just did not perform the way I had hoped.  If you are only needing help for a couple hours, you may be \\&quot;safe\\&quot; but not for an all day kind of thing.</li>
    <li> Did not work! Would not recommend this item to anyone!</li>
    <li> THIS REALLY REALLY WORKS YOUR EYE SHADOW LASTS ALL DAY LONG YOU DONT EVEN NEED TO REAPPLY I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE THAT WEARS EYE SHADOWS</li>
    <li> As I have aged I find my makeup seems to mysteriously disappear by end of day.  I tried the Mary Kay Primer and found it is light weight and has helped my makeup stay on longer.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I stick to the basics with make-up, and I refuse to spend very much on it.  This is a staple though that I cannot live without. Just a tiny dab on each eyelid keeps eye shadow in place all day and night, and usually prevents that shiny crease that I would otherwise get after a few hours of going about my daily routines.  There are some days, particularly hot and humid ones, where I still get that crease, but the majority of the time I do not.  I have yet to find a comparable eye primer at a similar price.</li>
    <li> This was as expected. Reliable product. Enjoyed being able to get on Amazon. I&#x27;ve used many eye primer products over the years, and this is the best one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and absolutely love it. It keeps eye shadow from bulking up in creases and really puts an extra &#x27;shine&#x27; to my lighter shades!</li>
    <li> The best primer.  Have used this for 5 years and I love it.its worth the money and it lasts a long while.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Makes your eyeshadow stay all day and it feels nice(:</li>
    <li> Never put my eye shadow on without this product going on first. Keeps my shadow in place all day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this having used Sephora&#x27;s perfecting eye primer for a couple years. While the Mary Kay does make eyeshadow last longer, it does not brighten the eye the way Sephora does. Also, it doesn&#x27;t feel silky and smooth; it feels heavy and draggy when you put it on. Threw it away after two uses and won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product . It makes my eye shadow look fresh ALL day .  I have tried other brands this is the best hands down.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I have elf liquid eyeliner and it kept smudging and leaking but I put a thin coat onto my eyelid before I put my makeup on it dry&#x27;s fast and I would recommend this for eyeshadow lovers!</li>
    <li> This is a reasonably good primer and the price is reasonable.  I still tend to prefer Lancome, but the two primers are different types, so I use both.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay for over a decade so yes I&#x27;m partial. I never go wrong when using this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go without it.  This completely prevents your eyeshaddow from creasing.  Helps to keep the eyeshaddow on longer too.  I hope this product is around forever!!</li>
    <li> This primer seems to work.  It helps keep my eyeshadow from creasing on my eyelids.  I can tell a difference when I do not wear it with my eyeshadow.</li>
