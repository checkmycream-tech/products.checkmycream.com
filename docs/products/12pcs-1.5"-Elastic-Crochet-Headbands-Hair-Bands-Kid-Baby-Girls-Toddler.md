    <li> i used them for tutus and works great. They are not wide. But good for a toddler tutus. Great color assortment.</li>

    <li> Very cute. Well made. And a lot less expensive than going to the store buying them individually. You can also snap bows on them or make your own bows to spice them up a little.</li>
    <li> Arrived way faster than expected.  Great range if colors, perfect for any outfit.  Fit my 5month old&#x27;s large head just fine! (90 percentile)</li>
    <li> seems like my granddaughter likes these headbands. She is... 3 years old. I didn&#x27;t get to go, but my husband says that she seemed to like them. :-) (she was walking around w/ one on her head). Such a great price!!!!</li>
    <li> Good price. Fast delivery.  I got everything fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I bought these because I make baby headbands. For the price I got them, I think that quality of these headbands are great. They do come from China, so if you live in the U.S., they will take a while to arrive. Mine came earlier than expected. It was worth the wait though.</li>
    <li> My daugther loves these she wears them as headbands. I originally brought them to make tutus.</li>
    <li> These items are poorly made. When arrived they smelled like chemicals, were dirty, and some of the material appeared burned.  I would not order from again; nor would I recommend them.  I am going to try to wash the headbands and see if they are useable, will update.</li>
    <li> I purchased them for my three year old she is a very crazy three year old so the headbands are a big nono for her. Less than three hours of wear the headband was ruined but they will be perfect for my newborn on the way. And they shipped super fast!!</li>
    <li> Fit great, lots of cute colors!</li>
    <li> Great for making tutus</li>
    <li> Very cute, but the knit loops pull out and look bad very easily</li>
