<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the absolutely best sunscreen!!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. It works in the strong sun of Aruba and Hawaii, and while it says you should reapply after swimming, I found you don&#x27;t really need to. The only downside is that you really need to rub it in or you look paleish/due to the blue coloring.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sunscreen for my face that had a good EWG rating and wouldn&#x27;t break me out.  I decided to try this after reading the reviews and I love it!  I have combination to oily, acne prone skin and this doesn&#x27;t break me out and it isn&#x27;t greasy.  It goes on white at first but once you rub it in all the way it blends into your skin and has a matte finish.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I did a search on &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; sunscreens and Blue Lizard came out in the top 5 of several different lists.  It gies on smoothly and covers well.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Only problem is getting it off. I found out that using an oily type soap will remove the lotion. I also have the sensitive and regular body lotion.</li>
    <li> I had read wonderful reviews on this sunscreen. Well, it didn&#x27;t live up to them! Unless you are willing to apply this like a thick coat of zinc oxide and not rub it in, it doesn&#x27;t work very well. I much prefer Nuetrogena&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Really nice sunscreen and very gentle on sensitive skin. Light weight and never feels greasy. Our summer wouldn&#x27;t be complete without it!</li>
    <li> I have eczema and very sensitive skin. I&#x27;m a one of those rare people who are allergic to sunscreen. This product is great. I really like that is is nature friendly too. Just a heads-up. All sensitive formulas do leave a white residue. It&#x27;s not that bad and is definitely better than a allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Love Blue Lizard products. Use it every day.</li>
    <li> I originally found this product at my dermatologist&#x27;s office then I found it cheaper at Amazon.com. This sunscreen is great for the face because it provides great sun protection without making your face oily or \\&quot;white.\\&quot; The bottle also turns blue to show you when UV rays are present; good eye opener of UV risks.</li>
    <li> Seems to work as intended plus it doesn&#x27;t stain white shirts like other sunscreens sometimes do.</li>
    <li> No odor, no sting, lasts long. This is the best sunscreen for every day, especially if you expect a lot of exposure. In Florida, outside 3-4 hours a day, my doctor and dermatologist say I&#x27;m doing a great job protecting my skin thanks to Blue Lizard. It does go on white, but that blends in shortly and you can apply makeup as usual.</li>
    <li> We have been buying this for approx. 18 years. It really works great. The price is a little steep but one of the best on the market and cheapest on Amazon. Also you can were the suntan lotion when swimming with the Dolphins or other marine fish. While other are entering the pools to be with the Dolphins and the caretakers will not let you use your suntan lotion and of course you get sunburn. With this product on problem</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years</li>
    <li> I  don&#x27;t get sunburned when using this one. This is my favorite sunscreen. It is a bit greasy, but most sunscreens are. This one does NOT cause me to break out, which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> I think it leaves a visible film on my light brown skin. too bad. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s amazing otherwise.</li>
    <li> I feel confident going out in the sun when I use Blue Lizard.</li>
    <li> My dermatoligist recommended this to me since I had some facial sun damage in the past. This is a great product. Couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores but was happy I could buy it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Daily moisturizer, not a waterproof sunscreen.  My fault for not reading more carefully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used four varieties of Blue Lizard -- Baby, Sensitive, Face, and Sport -- and I&#x27;ve posted the same review for each one. Baby and Sensitive are virtually identical. Face feels more dry, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin shiny. Sport seems to go on a little easier, but also has more potentially irritating chemicals than Sensitive or Baby (or so I&#x27;m told).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the bottom line: Each version of Blue Lizard that I have tried will last through a 4+ hours of golf in direct midday sun, even when I&#x27;m perspiring heavily, and I&#x27;ll go home with NO redness or burning whatsoever. (FYI, I am very light skinned and do develop a tan, but burn VERY easily, in 15 min. or less. I also perspire a lot, especially in the heat and humidity around the Washington D.C. metro area, where we live.) A little goes a long way, and if you take a few minutes to work it in, it stays put pretty well and doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t the easiest to put on, and it takes some soap and water to get it off, but until they change the formula is some significant way, Blue Lizard is head and shoulders above all the other major-brand sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried -- and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. It&#x27;s also nice that the Baby and Sensitive versions get high marks for their lack of toxic chemicals, and we&#x27;ve used them on babies and toddlers with sensitive skin, and never had any problems, either with burning or reaction to the sunscreen. Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned, and burn easily so my dermatologist recommended this product. I still get color, without the burn! I also have had bad allergic reactions to other sunscreens, and this one hasn&#x27;t given me a rash like the others so I would recommend it to people with sensitive skin as well.</li>
    <li> heavier than expected</li>
    <li> THE BEST SUNBLOCK without all the garbage of a chemical pool found in the all other brands.</li>
    <li> Nice combo of zinc oxide and mild sun screen chemicals. A lot of fragrance free sunscreen still has a smell but this is very mild.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by my dermologist. Only sun screen I use on my face after three facial surgeries.</li>
    <li> It does not cost a fortune and does a solid job of protecting the skin from sunlight.  Applying it is sometimes chalky, and accidentally using too much of the product leaves white flakes on the skin. Otherwise, it does not irritate my sensitive skin and feels great throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen. The best. Rubs in like a good moisturizer without the greasy feel. I see this at Dermatologist offices &amp; at my Plastic Surgeons office &amp; on every list for the &amp;#34;Best Sunscreens&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s obviously the only one I use.</li>
    <li> I love the color changing bottle. I like how non greasy it looks. The downside is that for some folks with darker skin it can give the &amp;#34;semi ghostly&amp;#34; palor. Many people say I look better all of a sudden and wondered if I had applied something to my face. I don&#x27;t know if that is  because of the palor or because of my switching to a non greasy sunblock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a distance swimmer and I&#x27;m in the pool for two hours every single day, in the hot Florida sun so I have been searching far and wide for a truly waterproof sunscreen. When I ran out of Blue Lizard Sport, I thought I might give this a whirl and surprise, surprise- it works even better! Not only did it protect my skin perfectly, but it hasn&#x27;t clogged my skin at all and has actually IMPROVED my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for those with sensitive skin, those who need a true waterproof sunblock, and those who could benefit from skin improvement. I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a daily lotion after a shower or anything (too thick and heavy), but if you are regularly out in the sun and need a sunblock that works, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Blue Lizard is the ONLY brand of sunscreen product we buy -- and we spend a LOT of time outdoors and on the water -- surfing, kayaking, on a stand-up paddleboard or just sitting on the deck, watching the action on Gulf and the seabirds overhead while reading a book. We buy several kinds -- for in the water, for the face and just for being outdoors. It is worth every well-priced penny we spend on it.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen that I have ever used on my face!</li>
    <li> This is one of the first facial sunscreens I&#x27;ve found that is zinc oxide based and also light enough that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective sunscreen, and I love the fact that it is loaded with antioxidants. Though white and goopy out of the bottle, it blends well into the skin and does not leave an obvious white cast, though it does provide some face brightening on my very pale skin. Unfortunately, this sunscreen is too rich for me in summer, when my skin is naturally more oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who finds this sunscreen makes their skin red or irritated, try applying it to completely dry skin. Sensitive skins can more easily experience uncomfortable reactions to chemical sunscreens when applied to moist skin. Blue Lizard also makes a mineral version of this sunscreen, but I find that micronized minerals don&#x27;t provide adequate full-spectrum protection from cancer-causing rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard does not test on animals</li>
    <li> This product is great for the face. Too expensive for the entire body though. Love how the bottle changes color when exposed to UV.</li>
    <li> This product does an excelent job blocking the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.  Recommended by my dermatologist.  Really isn&#x27;t greasy and sinks right into my skin.</li>
    <li> I got this sunscreen at the recommendation of my dermatologist.  I was taking Accutane and was going to be in the sun non-stop for a houseboat trip (not a good combo on that medication..burn, burn burn).  It is absolutely worth every penny!  While the SPF is only 30 it might as well perform like 90!  It is a bit on the thick side (I joked with friends that I was lathering on Crisco), but it rubs in well.  I am no longer on Accutane and continue to use this sunblock.  I love it that I don&#x27;t have to reapply over and over.  I also purchased the Baby formula (it is cheaper than the regular kind) and love it as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pale person by nature and have a strong history of skin cancer in my family. My dermatologist recommended this brand because it uses titanium dioxide and doesn&#x27;t rely on other, less reliable screening agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the low SPF number fool you-- other American brands that claim a higher SPF will soon be told to stop lying! :-) Blue Lizard goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t greasy, and really, really works. Everyone in my family uses it daily.</li>
    <li> It is very good sun screen and referred by Doctors but is not water proof, would run into my eyes. I work outdoors so didn&#x27;t work for me . The rest of the family have no complaint.</li>
    <li> Great product! No harsh chemicals and lasts a long time! A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have spread the word to friends and family that this is the best facial sunscreen I have ever found. It protects, doesn&#x27;t feel thick or leave white marks on your skin. It makes my skin actually feel nice!</li>
    <li> Keeps my face from getting sunburned but when you put it on it isn&#x27;t very moisturizing, but I really like it anyway because my face tends to get really oily so it is perfect for me!</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen! Goes on well; you see wear you&#x27;ve put it and then the white fades! And, even better for me it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes like so many others have (even very expensive ones)! This is one of the ones my Dermatologist recommended, and this is the one I&#x27;ll be using from now on!</li>
    <li> I had been using Eucerin Daily Protection for face for the past years but after I found out that it was poorly rated in the EWG website, I started searching for alternatives.  First I tried[[ASIN:B000V1QLEM Vanicream Sunscreen, Sensitive Skin, Spf 60, 4 Ounce]] due to the very good reviews on Amazon and got really disappointed since it was way too greasy.  And then, I gave it a try to this Blue Lizard sunscreen for face and I am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin white: The sunscreen is thick white cream, so first your face does look white.  However, as you spread it over your face, it turns transparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Not greasy: It takes a couple of minutes until the sunscreen settles on your face, so I change, make coffee or whatever I have to do in the morning after I put the sunscreen on.  By the time, I am ready to put my makeup on, my face is nicely moisturized and matte, ready for mineral powder foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Scent: There is some scent, but not strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good daily sunscreen!</li>
    <li> This was the best sunscreen I have used ever. Even though it took some time to rub in, it was worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;because myself and family had no sunburn and was at beach and pool in Mexico</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a 2 week trip to HI.  I avoid regular sunscreen because I don&#x27;t like the idea of spreading a lot of chemicals over my body several times a day.  However, this is not the answer.  It is quite hard to spread, much thicker than most screens and I never did quite get the white out.  I looked like a ghost after applying it.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle now and really like this stuff. It goes on white and is pretty thick but if you rub it in well, it turns clear. I use this every day and apply it generously too and one bottle lasted me 3 months! I&#x27;m at that point in life where I&#x27;m still battling adult acne(yay!) but also getting wrinkles(double yay!) and so I was looking for something that would ward off those evil aging sunrays but also not aggravate my acne and this does both - perfect! The price is great and another thing that ticks it off in my book is that from reading other reviewers, it comes highly recommended by dermatologists!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it can be quite drying and you do need a decent face wash to make sure that you can wash off all traces at night so I make sure to moisturize well before I apply it and have a very mild scrub that I use to wash my face in the evening. However, I feel like these are small prices to pay for such an effective product!</li>
    <li> #1 safe ingredients. #2 light clean scent! #3 So easy to rub in. #4 Very effective. My teenager is picky and he uses it every day!! Thanks for the Speedy Shipping too!</li>
    <li> Great sunblock.  Love this stuff.  If I had a little too much sun the day before, I use this on the beach the next day and it protects my skin.  If you are fair skinned or have a tendency to burn, this will give you great protection.</li>
    <li> This sunscrean is not really good for face because it is too oily and it also makes me break out.</li>
    <li> I love love love this sunscreen. Not greasy, no breakouts and leaves my skin super soft all while protecting against harmful UVA/UVB rays. Sometimes it is cheaper to buy the bigger bottle, other times not so much so do the price per ounce before purchasing.</li>
    <li> We use this on faces much of the year. Its pretty gentle and does a great job keeping the sun out.</li>
    <li> About 20 years ago a dear friend who had cancer was told by her doctor to use Blue Lizard.  When I saw it on a list of good products listed by the EPA  I remembered.  Could not find it locally but was glad to find it on Amazon.  I have been VERY pleased with it and will buy again .</li>
    <li> Two qualities of this sunscreen that rate it #1 with me is:&lt;br /&gt;1. Truly fragrance free&lt;br /&gt;2. Not too thick-not too thin; perfect consistency for even coverage and quick absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on my clean face each morning, wait a few moments and then apply a SPF lightweight moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended Blue Lizard.</li>
    <li> Nice, nice, nice.............very thick, but does the job</li>
    <li> Fantastic protection, even in tropical sun. NO burning eyes, even after swimming in pool or ocean. We are now converts to Blue Lizard!</li>
    <li> Sure thought this product sounded great, but after reading reviews I can&#x27;t get past the Octinoxate in this stuff. there is no way we are putting chemicals on our kids or us.  Will have to keep searching. Folks do your own research on Chemicals and the effect they have on your body...not a group.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Blue Lizard face sunscreen for over 5 years.  I do not use daily sunscreen, but use this brand anytime I am going to be outside for a while.  I love it because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, or promote breakouts.  I have used this sunscreen in Hawaii, the Caribbean, and in the water and felt well protected, but reapply if swimming or sweating.  I have fair skin, and tend to get hyperpigmentation when in the sun.  I do tend to wear a hat often when outside, but this sunscreen has been great for me!</li>
    <li> I got the product after reading the reviews, but in my opinion I don&#x27;t see the deference between this product and the other ones in the market.</li>
    <li> Does the trick. I don&#x27;t notice any tan when I go jogging wearing this in the middle of the afternoon. I like that it&#x27;s not very sticky and rubs in well. I didn&#x27;t want waterproof because I didn&#x27;t need it for swimming, and I shower quickly after my workout. I also don&#x27;t like the hassle of getting waterproof things off my skin (tried waterproof mascara ONCE. Never again.) so this is great. My favorite thing about this, though, is that the bottle turns blue in UV light. I&#x27;m surprised at how blue it gets just sitting in my bathroom, which has a tiny little window. Wow. The ingredients in this seem pretty legit too. I think I remember reading green tea extract being one. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and I don&#x27;t break out after using it. Doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy, but it&#x27;s thick enough that when I wear this, I can forgo using my BB cream under my powder and just wear powder because the powder will go on just thick enough to give me similar coverage.</li>
    <li> Bought this product as an alternative to the usual sun protection products. It is easy on the skin and reduces the skin irritation I get from other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I work outside all day and needed a sunscreen that will not sting my eyes. This is it. Goes 9 nice and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy white residue either.</li>
    <li> I resisted trying Blue Lizard for years because it seemed so inconvenient vs. drug store brands, but I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve tried it now. It really feels almost like wearing no sunscreen at all; it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m sweating it off within 2 minutes. There is a slight white tinge to your face when it&#x27;s on, but less so than many other titanium dioxide based sunscreens.</li>
    <li> One of the safest, highest rated and best sunscreen products on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve avoided using sunblock on my face simply because everything I&#x27;d tried had caused irritation and a lot of discomfort.  This stuff works very well and does not irritate my skin at all. I use a thin layer of my daily moisturizer and then apply the sunblock. It is thicker and leaves my skin looking whiter due to the zinc, but once it absorbs in it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Best product around......will use it every beach day and also on my grandkids. Love it.....and my dermatologist recommended it to me.</li>
    <li> Used it for a week in the southern Caribbean and no burn on any of us.  5 Stars for effectiveness but knocked one star off overall because it is very think and difficult to apply.  If possible I would have given it 4.75 probably.</li>
    <li> GREAT ITEM/PRICE AND FAST SHIPPING GREAT SELLER THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SUNSCREANS I HAVE EVER USED WAS RECOMMENED BY MY DERM DOC ...GREAT6 SELLTER GO</li>
    <li> Everyone is talking about the B&amp;B creams - sunscreen &amp; moisturizer &amp; Base color - well, for lots less money and way more protection, just put a little of Blue Lizard for face in the palm of your hand, add a tiny bit of your normal base /foundation cover, mix it up and slather it on your face!  you get a great looking light coverage, natural looking, with a sunscreen that will protect your face all day!  You can also mix in a little moisturizer if you want, doesn&#x27;t lessen the affect of the sunscreen.  And don&#x27;t forget your ears!</li>
    <li> I used this every single day on my face, under my makeup.  Does not leave my skin greasy or shiny.  Does not cause breakouts.  It does take a bit of rubbing in, or else it will leave a whitish cast to your skin.  I let it sink in for a minute, then apply my makeup.  I have been using this daily for at least 2 years.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for my very sensitive skinned little boy.  Does not break his skin out.  Goes on white and once rubbed in, is almost unnoticeable.</li>
    <li> Used on the Grand Tour of Urah National Parks &amp; Mesa Verde NP. Worked as well as advertised with the added bonus of fewer nasty components. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this on my face while at the lake for 3 days.  Used an SPF 55 on my body but did not reapply (didn&#x27;t reapply this on my face either) and while my shoulders ended up pink, my face and hair part (where I applied this) were just fine. Wakeboarding, sweating in the 100 degree heat, and lots of jumping off of rocks and houseboats and this held up perfectly.</li>

To add salt to the injury, this a company where their CEO goes around Hawaii&#x27;s kindergartens in the name of educating kids about sunscreen while promoting Blue Lizard but yet Blue Lizard would not disclose ingredients of their sunscreens on their website at all. Someone in Hawaii&#x27;s government is surly enjoying the fruits of his/her work alright. I wonder why anyone in Hawaii has never addressed this issue...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ INGREDIENTS. THE HIGHER THE ZINC, THE MORE PROTECTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf. For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. The more zinc, the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to EVCO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard Baby&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 30+&lt;br /&gt;- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection&lt;br /&gt;- Chemical-Free&lt;br /&gt;- Paraben-Free&lt;br /&gt;- Fragrance-Free&lt;br /&gt;- 10% Zinc Oxide; 5% Titanium Dioxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard Face&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 30+&lt;br /&gt;- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection&lt;br /&gt;- Paraben-Free&lt;br /&gt;- Fragrance-Free&lt;br /&gt;- Oil-Free&lt;br /&gt;- 8% Zinc Oxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 30+&lt;br /&gt;- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection&lt;br /&gt;- Chemical-Free&lt;br /&gt;- Paraben-Free&lt;br /&gt;- Fragrance-Free&lt;br /&gt;- 10% Zinc Oxide; 5% Titanium Dioxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard Sport&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 30+&lt;br /&gt;- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection&lt;br /&gt;- Very Water Resistant&lt;br /&gt;- 6% Zinc Oxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard Regular&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 30+&lt;br /&gt;- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection&lt;br /&gt;- Very Water Resistant&lt;br /&gt;- 6% Zinc Oxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason why sunscreen companies do not provide any images of the labeling since that will disclose the active and inactive ingredients. The inactive ingredients are extensive in Blue Lizard, check their Internet site but more importantly compare the cost of any sunscreen to better brands with hardly any ingredients except few organic and a very high amount of zinc like 18% zinc not 5% or 10% zinc. Blue Lizard&#x27;s ingredients vary so much from their Face mix to the Original mix to the Baby mix since they offer more additives, less zinc with noticeable price fluctuation. Cancer does not differentiate face skin or leg skin, it is all the same so why apply anything that has less protection to different part of the body. Ingredients get soaked in regardless of the skin location so compare ingredients since it is like consuming those ingredients when applied to the skin. A good organic 3oz 18% zinc mix should not cost more than $13 and for less when on sale. I get lots more when I make my own, much, much more and I get to control the zinc percentage in the mix as well.o the Baby mix since they offer more additives, less zinc with noticeable price fluctuation.

    <li> After much research, I choose this sunscreen based on many factors including: EWG&#x27;s rating, previous consumer&#x27;s reviews, price, and ease of purchase. This product has exceeded all expectations I have of it. I would highly recommend to anyone who has read and is concerned about the crazy things sunscreens do. Also, this sunscreen is the easiest to apply and rub in that I&#x27;ve seen with any &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; sunscreen (there is some grease and whiteness, but just keep spreading) and it prevented sunburn after many hours (and reapplications as stated on bottle)!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I received the product on time.  It is Ok</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for sun protection.  And, I noted that brown sun spots that I had on my face actually ligtened a good deal and one even disappeared.  The only negative with the product is that is does dry out your skin, so a lotion to replace moisture is needed after use.</li>
    <li> A great sunscreen with a high tech bottle (tells you when to reapply) from the country most acquainted with ozone hole woes (Australia).  We&#x27;re big fans.</li>
    <li> Used this while on vacation on a Caribbean cruise and it was great (the lotion that is).  Applied once or twice during the day (depending on how much in the water) with about 6 to 7 hours of exposure.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I burn very easily and have been searching for an effective sunscreen. This is it. This is the best suncreen ever. The only problem I had was I used too much the first time I used it. When I adjusted the amount I applied it was perfect. This is great, I did not burn, hooray!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the way it goes on and protects my sking. I use it on my face, but also on my neck and any areas where the sunscreen may come in contact with light-colored clothing.  This product doesn&#x27;t stain fabric.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many facial sunscreens and this is the best of them. I usually use sunscreens with only mineral actives because the chemical sunscreens always migrate into my eyes and cause them to sting. But this product does have a partly mineral, partly chemical sunscreen formulation, and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes at all. Mineral-based sunscreens tend to have a white cast, and while this one is no exception, the ghostly effect is noticeably less than others. It goes on less greasy than others, yet it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out over the course of the day the way others do (not sure how that works, but it does). It&#x27;s also super effective. I burn very easily, and one application of this in the morning keeps me from burning all day when I&#x27;m normally active (if I&#x27;m swimming or sweating heavily, though, I may need another application). And bonus: this stuff is priced really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble: I don&#x27;t care for the way the product dispenses from the five-ounce bottle. Depending on how full the bottle is, it can be difficult to control the amount I get out when I squeeze the bottle. I&#x27;m going to try the three ounce tube to see if it works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: it can be really difficult to completely remove sunscreens that contain mineral actives, including this one. I find that oil cleansers work great for that purpose. DHC makes the best-known one, but there are many others, including Eucerin&#x27;s much less expensive shower oil. What you&#x27;re looking for is a formulation containing mostly oil, with an emulsifier (just oil alone without the emulsifier doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well).</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen product that is very effective. Not too greasy or foul odor. Only sunscreen I have found that does not irritate my 8 year old daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. If you find this a bit pricey it is worth the money. A little goes a long way and very easy on the skin. Strongly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Having a surfer teen who doesnt really care much about sun damages yet........this one is a must, never got a sun burn in his face, and iam sure he doesnt reapply as much he should, really protect your skin from damaging sun rays without chemicals. Teen aproved!!!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist. I have been very happy with this sunscreen and have ordered two smaller sizes. I went to use it the other day, and imagine my surprise when the bottle I had been using was almost empty. Evidently my husband, who works on our county roads, has discovered how wonderful it is, as well. I bought this larger bottle to have enough for both of us to use.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It goes on without any greasiness. It does leave your face a bit pale for a few minutes. I haven&#x27;t burned with it yet.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is very thick but absorbs quickly. So far it has done a great job of protecting my kids from sunburn!</li>
    <li> I had a bad experience but part of it was my fault.  I thought this was sunscreen that you can go in the water with but this is just a moisturizer with sunscreen.  BEWARE of this.  Typically if it is called sunscreen it is water resistant and moisturizer is called moisturizer with SPF.  This is not and I had my daughter apply it 4 times on the 4th of July as she seemed to be getting pink and she was so burned by the end of the day because I did not realize this and it kept washing off in the lake.  So, it may be a good product but I think the name of it is kind of misleading.  I won&#x27;t buy their products again as I came back to look for a water resistant one, and even though they have what seems like 100s of products, I had a hard time telling which is actual sunscreen and which are moisturizers with sunscreen and I am not going to risk it again.</li>
    <li> On an island right now.  Just love this wonderful sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Works very good. We use it for surfing and it keeps our faces from getting burned.&lt;br /&gt;The product met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I am sure we will purchase again for next summer.It is in a cool plastic bottle and changes the color.It is pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> This gets absorbed quickly and was recommended by my dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and it works well.</li>
    <li> i struggle with rosecea and this sunscreen did as well as i&#x27;s expected and better than some others. i still experienced some dryness and peeling after several days of use, but it wasn&#x27;t as extreme as summers past. i don&#x27;t regret trying it, but i&#x27;,m still looking for a better solution. i don&#x27;t blame the sunscreen, it&#x27;s just my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Not greasy once it sets.</li>
    <li> I have always been a big fan of Blue Lizard. It can be difficult to find in stores so I always buy it here! Not to mention the bottle turns blue in the sun!</li>
    <li> Although I have brown skin (not Caucasian), I burn very very easily. 10 minutes of sun exposure during spring can burn my skin. I end up with swollen skin, a rash, terrible burning and itching. I have tried a lot of sun screen products on the market and none of them worked. My last resort was to wear UPF rated clothing, but even that did not protect my face.     This product really works. After using this I have never had a sun burn. It needs some rubbing in to avoid looking blue. It is not sticky or greasy. It is very easy to put on.     I bought this and the badger sunscreen to compare the two. This wins hands down. The badger product was thicker and more greasy. I now use this on my face and the badger sunscreen on my hands and legs.</li>
    <li> This product is not a pure mineral sunscreen, as I was expecting.  How disappointing!  It has the worst of both worlds: all the white pastiness of a physical block and all the health concerns of a chemical block!  At least Amazon now puts pictures of labels in their listings...just make sure you read the fine print with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s interesting that the bottle turns blue in UV light, but is it really that hard to tell when you&#x27;re in the sun?</li>
    <li> Wife does not like it, comes off</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t as thick which is perfect for your face. Zinc oxide is key and this has it.</li>
    <li> Best sunblock on the planet</li>
    <li> Works ok but it does feel a little greasy to me.</li>
    <li> We live in Hawaii where sun screen application is a daily chore.  Blue Lizard was recommended by a dermatologist because there are less chemicals.  Check it out for yourself at [...].  Highly recommend this and their other products too.  Baby formula is great.  Goes on thick but smooths out fast.</li>
    <li> I just wanted a little bottle of sunscreen to keep in my truck for when I forget to apply before heading to the golf course. I think the bottle turning blue is really cool, but other then that it&#x27;s sun screen. I can apply it before I golf, play for 4 hours and not come home looking like a lobster. Can&#x27;t ask more then that.</li>
    <li> I developed an allergy to chemical sunscreens which caused nightly hives outbreaks. I originally tried Blue Lizard Sensitive and it works well but I find Blue Lizard Faces leaves less of a whitish case on your skin (a problem with all zinc/titanium oxide sunscreens in my experience.) I wear this stuff on 3 hour bike rides where I&#x27;m sweating profusely and it works great. I use this stuff on my face because it has no odor but I use the Coppertone Sensitive sunscreen on my arms/legs because it&#x27;s cheaper. One tip for reducing the whitish cast of these sunscreens is to apply it, wait 10-15 minutes, and lightly dab your face with a damp towel. The goal is not to scrub the sunscreen but lightly dab off some of the whitish appearance. It significantly reduces the Giesha girl look LOL.</li>
    <li> makes me break out. I much prefer anything made by Badger.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected for my daughter that has very senstive skin.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I have found so far!! Will be buying this from here on out.. non greasy on your face, and doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea on my face.  I&#x27;ve tried some other products for this condition (there&#x27;s nothing really made that cures this problem) without any positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The #1 trigger for rosacea is sunlight.  I realized that the left side of my face had more of a problem than the right side.  Then it occurred to me that the left side of my face gets more sunlight exposure when driving than the right side does.  Maybe if I could mitigate the effects of sunlight, it might mitigate my rosacea problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen was recommended by others and it makes sense that during a normal day my face gets a lot of sunlight.  I don&#x27;t have to be out by the pool or at the beach to get a lot of sun on my face.  So the idea that a daily application of a sunscreen with all natural ingredients to protect my face from this major rosacea trigger made sense to me and I bought a bottle.  Again, I don&#x27;t consider this a cure, but a preventative application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been one week since I began a daily morning application of the product.  My rosacea has been noticeably diminished.  I think I&#x27;ve found a solution to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the product sparingly.  It&#x27;s a thick white liquid.  And I work that into my skin.  Initially, it leaves my skin a little white-ish and shiny, but that quickly fades and a natural looks remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe what I&#x27;m finding is that rosacea is fading due to the fact that I&#x27;m protecting my skin from the continual damage caused by sun exposure.  (Oh, my office gets full sun every afternoon and the left side of my face faces the windows.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this post after more time has past, but in just one week, I&#x27;m already feeling very good about Blue Lizard Australian Sunscreen SPF 30+, 5-ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this information will help others like me.</li>
    <li> Very nice sunscreen. Not greasy, feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  We use it every day on the boat.</li>
    <li> Prevents burns but is very thick and difficult to rub in.</li>
    <li> Blue lizard works well when it&#x27;s on, but if you miss any section of your skin then you&#x27;ll have a weird burnt spot from the area that you missed.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen does an excellent job with protecting my face from sunburn. I feel it is greasy and thick, but not getting burnt is more important to me. I have had no breakouts with this sunscreen. I would highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I AM 70 YEARS OLD AND LIVE IN A VERY HOT AND DRY CLIMATE.  I USE THIS PRODUCT DAILY AND IT REALLY HELPS PROTECT AGAINST SUN RAYS AND ALSO KEEPS MY SKIN MOIST.  I FINALLY GOT SOMETHING I REALLY LIKE TO USE ON MY FACE AS WELL AS MY ARMS AND LEGS.  I WILL CERTAINLY BE USING THIS PRODUCT HOPEFULLY FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> I bought this product while looking for a sunscreen that would not cause my eyes to burn and water just because I rubbed sunscreen on my face.  This was such a product (no eyes burning) but it was also to rub all the white in.  I feel embarrassed walking around with white all over my face. I found the Neutrogena Ultra-Sheer Dry touch not only kept my eyes from burning, but rubbed in easily with no white residue.</li>
    <li> Rubs in fine.  Doesn&#x27;t cake like other top drawer sunscreens.  Works well and does not feel greasy.  We use it outdoors exercising.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended. Less expensive than lotions sold in many doctors offices. Great preventative for skin cancer if used daily. Could not find in stores.</li>
    <li> The best.  Goes on light and works great.</li>
    <li> I have post herpetic neuralgia on my face. I have to be very careful what I put on my skin when it comes to sunscreen. This product is incredible. a little bit covers my face and neck. Rub it in. No unpleasant odor. No greasy, heavy feel. I can wear it as a straight moisturizer without no ill effects. Would recommend Blue Lizard to any one with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> sinks right in ... good coverage on the face</li>
    <li> I started using Blue Lizzard sunscreen for sensitive skin last year, and loved it. I used it all over including my face. It was a bit thick for my face, but did the job so well I went for it. This year I saw Blue Lizzard suncsreen for the face. I bought it right away. It is easier to apply, lighter, yet still works extremely well. I also use a site for all cosmetics and creams to check the level of toxicity. I have a tremendous amount of cancer in my family on both sides, so, I watch what I use to the best of my ability. Blue Lizzard&#x27;s ratings on this site were just what I was looking for. Very safe. All the other sunscreens I checked out were in the high risk area. I checked out a lot. I will not be buying any other brand of sunscreen. My daughter and I are both very fair and need good protection when ever we leave the house, no matter the season. So, for this product&#x27;s ability to save our skin from summer rays, as well as it does, says a lot for Blue Lizzard sunscreen for the face, sensitive skin or whatever you have. You can buy it, and use it with confinence. It lasts well and is fairly priced for the high quality.</li>
    <li> Effective and NOT greasy.  Great to prevent transfer to clothes.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy. The bottle turns blue when it is exposed to sunlight so it is a good reminder to reapply or nice gimmick to help get fussy kids to put on sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I just got back from being at the beach for 2 weeks. I used this every day on my face, swimming in the ocean and pool and it kept me protected. I did reapply once midday, but I would do that with any sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put it on your face, it does stay white at first, but it fades away in like 1-2 minutes. Doesn&#x27;t make you look like a ghost for an hour like some of the healthier sunscreens. It&#x27;s rated 1 or 2 by Environmental Working Group and it&#x27;s not that expensive, compared with other healthy options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sunscreen that qualified as a safe product.  I checked the EWG website for safe sunscreens. This one is ranked a 2 which is at the upper range of safe.  This one does not contain Vitamin A according to the information I have, but it does not mention if it contains nano-particles.  The product goes on smooth and disappears rather quickly.  There is no major whiteness left over but when I applied my base makeup, it was a little lighter than it usually is. I think that got better as time went along but the change in lightness was so small that I would not consider it a problem.  The product dries fairly fast and does not seem oily.  But it did make  my face a little drier and felt a little tight. The product is not too thick at all and was not clumpy.  It went on very smoothly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a sunscreen that I would purchase again.  The cost is the only factor as I use about 3 oz a day and a 5 oz bottle costs $11 so this is not one that I can afford and will probably only use this one on my face and have to find a less expensive brand for my body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this all summer under my makeup without any problems.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter. She is so happy and her very sensitive skin did not break out.</li>
    <li> I chose Blue Lizard because my long-time dermatologist recommended it.  I&#x27;ve used it for many years as a sunscreen and general day moisturizer.  I do not like the bottle though and always transfer it to a TSA size approved screw top bottle.</li>
    <li> It is a little greasy initially, but soaks in after 5 minutes or so. I use it everyday under my make up. I have Melasma and it has helped it from worsening and we spend many weekends out in the sun. I do re-apply every 2 hours because I am paranoid! I use it all over my body, not just my face. I like that it works the instant you put it on and don&#x27;t have to wait 30 minutes as with traditional sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Works great.  arrived on time.  I put it on half hour before playing tennis and it does not burn my eyes and does not run  into my mouth.  i will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Just got back from a week in Orlando, and I am crazy about this sunblock. I got no color whatsoever, which was my goal. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: Very effective, rubs in completely, not greasy (I hate when I feel sticky while I&#x27;m sightseeing.) I am hoping this is less toxic than US brands I&#x27;ve been using. Washed off easily in the shower, which I like. My daughter loved the fact that the bottle turns blue in UV light, as a visual cue you need sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not waterproof or rub-proof. We re-applied once or twice daily, which I didn&#x27;t mind. I will stick with my Arbonne waterproof for swimming.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a formulation containing the reflective properties of zinc oxide that&#x27;s easy to rub into the skin and that doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue. Blue Lizard isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve found in these two categories.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite sunscreen!  MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE! I bought 2 of these and didnt notice they both expired in 6 months.;k I recommend you ask THE SELLER when it expires before placing your order. Sunscreen usually last up to 1 year. As for this sunscreen or any blue lizard product I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great!  However disappointed that it is not water proof!!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen, mixed in with lotion, has lasted me an entire year of daily use. The bottle color-changing effect is cool, too. Good for sensitive skin (which I have).</li>
    <li> I got this last year when my son was 1.  Luckily by putting this his face didn&#x27;t turn like blue lizard but rather was protecting from the sun beam.  Of course your baby doesn&#x27;t like when we put some type of cream on their face but this wasn&#x27;t as sticky as other brands and it was pretty smooth.  Bit pricey for the suncream but what can we do?  We gotta use the good stuff for the baby and me and my wife get something cheap i guess &#x3D;p</li>
    <li> Great product. doesn&#x27;t leave marks</li>
    <li> Best ever!  I do active water sports in salt water.  This does not get in your eyes.</li>
    <li> Its give a brighter skin look. Pretty moisturizing stay all day n although it made my skin whiter but I still like it</li>
    <li> Our dermatologist gave us a sample of this product several years ago.  We could not find it locally, but we liked it so much that we ordered it from Amazon.  It provides great coverage, is not greasy and is lightweight.  Also a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My mother and father have been diagnosed with skin cancer and had to have several operations to get it removed. This is one of the ONLY products that their oncologist and dermatologist would even recommend. No other &#x27;broad spectrum&#x27; brands like Neutrogena even have the essential ingredients to block out the suns harmful rays. THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT I NOW USE ON ME, MY HUSBAND AND CHILDREN. WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is really very good, but I have to say that it is very appropriate for fair skin people, since it leaves a white cast when applied to face. Since I have fair skin, it is perfect, because it gives a little coverage and uniform color to my face. The protection is an even better component on this product. It protects a great deal!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen - stays put and works even while playing tennis for 2+ hours. It goes on a little white but quickly sinks in. Maybe because of that it seems to even out my skin tone a little bit. But I do NOT look like a geisha while wearing it. lol I love that it&#x27;s safe - doesn&#x27;t have the harmful ingredients so many of the mainstream sunscreens do - so I feel confident using it. Have even used it under makeup and it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> This lotion is easy to apply.  I have been using it for the summer and found it to help protect my face from the sun.</li>
    <li> Probably the best sunscreen I have tried (and I have tried lots)... easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes and is chemical-free.  I highly recommend it - . I am an inmunosupressed patient, so I must use sunscreens all the time.</li>
    <li> After dealing with some skin issues last spring I decided to look for a better sunscreen and I sure found it! Had Blue Lizard overnighted before a trip and while the extra shipping wasn&#x27;t something I would normally do I was so happy I did. It&#x27;s the only sunscreen I will use on my face now!</li>
    <li> For those of us on well water with a high iron content, this product will greatly reduce or eliminate stains caused when washing clothes after using products that contain  avobenzone which is the most widely used sunscreen chemical. This product is thicker and last much longer than those that contain avobenzone.</li>
    <li> It simply works.  I have sensitive skin, and often make the comments that I have two colors. pasty white, and lobster red painful burnt.  With this product I never have to worry about the latter.  With others I will still manage to somehow get sunburn, with Blue Lizard it has yet to happen.  As long as I can order this and have it around I will continue to be a loyal customer, and user of Blue Lizard.</li>
    <li> I used Blue lizard maybe 5 years ago (different formula; it never gave me any trouble).  With summer coming around I need a reliable sunblock and I thought I&#x27;d try this based on the fact that it worked in the past for me and it has pretty great overall reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly my skin is very fair, ultra sensitive, and acne prone.  This TRASHED my face.  I was really surprised too, since I didn&#x27;t see any of the other reviewers complaining about breakouts.  So disappointing.  I really wish they&#x27;d never changed the formula.  I guess I&#x27;ll use it up on my arms--the search continues.</li>
    <li> I live near a beach and go often. i have fair skin and use retin a. no sting in eyes. no sun gets in and it feels like you don&#x27;t have anything on. Highly recommend. go aussies.</li>
    <li> I like this and would purchase again.  It does not leave a white film on the skin!  I haven&#x27;t put the product to any major challenges, such as being out in summer sun for any extended period, but so far I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Its dry and long lasting, isint greassey. If applied 20 minutos before sun exposure you get no sunburns at all.</li>
    <li> Great product - recommended by dermatologists and it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals of other sunscreens.  I feel good about putting it on my children and myself.</li>
    <li> With many years of going to the Caribbean, you need and must have the best face protection! This is it! It must be the zinc oxide that provides the best protection! I have used many different kinds but purchased this this year...it will not fail you ladies! I missed a small place on my face and knew immediately it was burned badly! I am very impressed!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the BOMB!!  Makes my skin silky smooth.  Try it, you will like it!! ;-)  Thanks for an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I have been a huge fan of organic or natural products. I have used the Burts&#x27; Bee&#x27;s suncream but it is not as good as this one for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;the texture is more user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;there is chemical free&lt;br /&gt;what&#x27;s more important, it is useful to protect you from UV</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my husband&#x27;s skin doctor and Amazon was the best buy for us.  He has been using it about 1 year and is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I live in Arizona and am out in the sun walking and biking everyday so this is a great product. Not heavy and the smell is fine, not overpowering like some sunscreens. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> My favorite, what can I say? Don&#x27;t worry about the white ghost look you initially have, just rub in a little more and wait five minutes for it to absorb. Works great, even sailing all day! Don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> I wear sunscreen every day of the year. Most sunscreens with zinc oxide leave a white residue on your face, and then you have to use a bronzer to cover up the white powder. When you apply, the white look is there, but disappears. Plus, a little goes a long way. I went to a local store to purchase and it was twice the amount as advertised on Amazon. Amazon is the best site on the web. I order everything from them. Regarding the sunscreen, I use it exclusively now on my face and all of my &amp;#34; old &amp;#34; sunscreens are not used on the back side of my hands to prevent sun damage. After I use up all my &amp;#34; old &amp;#34; sunscreen, I&#x27;ll use Blue Lizard on the back side of my hands as well.  I have this on subscribe and save, which allows you to save even more.</li>
    <li> Good value (price relative to quantity and quality).  I&#x27;ve tried lots of sunscreens in recent years trying to find one that scores low on the EWG website and that I like.  So far Blue Lizard face (and the body one, too) are my favorites.  I would recommend this product to others. Yes, it has a little bit of whiteness to it, but it is not too greasy and you can get it to rub in so you won&#x27;t look like a ghost.</li>
    <li> Goes on well with no breakouts.  I have no burning when I use it.  Last the whole day when mowing commercially.</li>
    <li> I recently had some precancerous spots removed from my face and my dermatologist said it was a must to use a sunscreen daily.  He recommended Blue Lizard Australian Sunscreen for face.  I was concerned about how it would do under my mineral makeup, but it works great.  Not to greasy, not to dry.  My makeup seems to stay \\&quot;set\\&quot; all day &amp; I feel confident that I am protected from the sun.  If there are any sun worshippers out there reading this, take heed; a sun tan is beautiful on your skin, but you will eventually pay the price.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and must avoid getting sun on my face.  This is the best sunscreen by far for protecting my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two years as a lotion under makeup.  It blends away daily, leaves no oily residue, and uses the recommended ingredients for sunblock.  I have never had it cause breakouts or cause me to feel oily like I would expect from sunscreen.  I have even been paid compliments on my skin.  As I age (over 40), I appreciate a good product that will help prevent further wrinkles from sun damage.  I also use it on my children in the summer on their faces, it doesn&#x27;t run into their eyes so they prefer it.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> As someone who is violently allergic to the chemical sunscreen ingredients, but paperwhite pale, this type of sunscreen is a Godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face version soaks in immediately and leaves only the faintest hint that you used anything on your face.  It works really well under makeup (foundation type or mineral), too.  5 ounces goes a long way, and it seems decently sweat proof for hot summer days.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s Review:  This sunscreen has a nice light texture that goes on easily with no greasiness and it doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on my face like many zinc oxide sunscreens do.  BUT I didn&#x27;t realize until I bought it that it also contains octinoxate which, according to my research, is a chemical sunscreen that is less irritating than most but has been shown to degrade in sunshine (a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t work in the sun?), produces free radicals that continue to damage your skin after sun exposure, and may be a hormone disruptor that mimics estrogen.  Experts advise children and pregnant women to stay away - yikes.  So despite the kid-beloved bottle that turns blue in sunshine and the light non-irritating formula that rubs into the kids faces so easily, I can&#x27;t use this on my kids.  And although I am not pregnant, I have had trouble with hormone imbalance, so I won&#x27;t be using it either.  If you don&#x27;t mind using chemical sunscreens this is a really nice one, but for us it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> No streaks that sometimes come with Zinc sunscreen.  Did not cause any breakouts and I have sensitive skin.  Worked well for an all weekend yoga festival outside.</li>
    <li> Great paraben free and healthy broad spectrum sunscreen with zinc oxide in it. It&#x27;s not noticeable when applied to face. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The product image is misleading because it shows two bottles. Because of this, I purchased this item when otherwise I would have purchased a different item. Only one bottle arrived in the mail.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin that burns easily and I stayed out for hours in the garden, several days a week, all summer, without getting one sunburn.  This sunscreen was the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I&#x27;m not fond of the bottle, a little too hard for me to squeeze and if I forget and shake it with the top flipped up, the sunscreen gets splattered all over.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this many months ago and knocked off a star because the product contained parabens- -potential hormone interupters.  It is now paraben free and I love it.  Wore it all summer long, two or three days a week, two hours at a time playing tennis in the hot mid morning sun and no burn.  It is light and silky for a zinc oxide sunscreen, not as greasy as most and goes on easily.  There is a slight white residue but far less than many other zinc oxide products and it rubs in very easily. Blue Lizard Face contains moisturizers so it is a one step product before I go out.  Without a doubt this is my favorite sunscreen for the face.  I use Blue Lizard Sensitive or Baby for my body and love them as well.</li>
    <li> The only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t burn and irritate my child&#x27;s severe eczema</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to find a sunscreen specially formulated for the face. Blue Lizard is lightweight and non greasy. It is highly recommended by dermatologists and gentle on the skin. I finally found a sunscreen that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I knew I could trust sunscreen designed for the hottest, sunniest continent on earth. Used it for my face and chest specifically because that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m prone to break out. While using this I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts from it.  Was pricey for the amount but seeming I&#x27;m only using it for the face and around the face, it shouldn&#x27;t be used up too quickly. Packaging turns blue outdoors</li>
    <li> Not bad; not sticky (unless you put too much on); rubs in well; would buy again.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, feels natural on my face.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizing, along with very good sun protection. This particular lotion has less of a whitening effect, which we very much appreciate.</li>
    <li> We liked this product, but it my granddaughter seemed to be allergic, broke her out.  The rest of us liked it a lot and used it every day for two weeks at the beach.</li>
    <li> I can still detect the whiteness even hours after applying. I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great sunblock, but it looks ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Real good didn&#x27;t burn my eyes and kept me from burning my face. Easy to apply. Best lotion with sunscreen I ever used when boating.</li>
    <li> I was planning on writing this review anyway, but my husband especially wanted to make sure that I did because as he says &amp;#34;people need to know&amp;#34;. This is the best face sun lotion we have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s skin is very dry and pretty sensitive, but he can use this every single day as his regular face lotion- which he does during the summer months. I noticed that his forehead was still getting pink no matter what sun lotion he used, and we couldn&#x27;t figure out if others were too thin or..? This product does not feel thick on the face once it is rubbed in and it does not need to be reapplied if you are not getting in the water. We always reapply after we get out of the water, so I couldn&#x27;t say if its not necessary. My husband surfs, and plays disc golf, and this lotion has worked for him all day long. His biggest complaint with face lotion is that it runs into his eyes when he sweats- this lotion does not do that. This is the only face sun lotion we&#x27;re going to buy from here on out.</li>
    <li> As others have said, very hard to rub in, leaves a whitish cast for an hour or so.  It does however work well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin, other than you have to do a LOT of rubbing to apply it.  Not really sure it was worth the price and hassle to get over others.</li>
    <li> This is the sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends.  It is one of a very few that keeps my skin protected and does not irritate my skin. Being a person with very sensitive skin it is a real find for me.  It&#x27;s this or nothing so that I don&#x27;t have skin eruptions or sun poison.&lt;br /&gt;The best I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, this is the only sunscreen I can use on my face, the dermatologist told me after he gave me a bag of top rated sunscreens, that most likely I would only be able to use Blue Lizard.  He sure was right, no perfumes or other irritating ingredients.  I do enjoy the coconut smell of  sunscreens but I can&#x27;t tolerate the chemicals.  It is a very good product if you have to avoid chemicals.  The zince oxide really soothes my skin as well.</li>
    <li> great EWG rating for safety!!</li>
    <li> I use this for my son everyday for sunny school days. Works great for short play outside. I tried to use for the beach and he got very tan...he did NOT burn but did get darker. So now when at the beach or swim class I use this as a top coat and for reapply for his face neck and ears since it is so easy to put on he does not complain like he does with the thicker kinds of sunscreen that are hard to rub in. I also use this for myself as a daily face lotion during the summer since it is so light. Also helps reinforce skin health that the kids can understand by the bottle turning blue. My son will take the bottle outside and if it turns blue he says yup, need my sunblock today mom. Love it!</li>
    <li> I put this on my face before going to work (Lifeguarding). It keeps me from getting burned. Only problem is that I get a ton of red bumps on my forehead cheeks from putting this on. It also causes me to breakout the next day. Not sure why, I expected this not to cause either of those conditioning because it is recommended by dermatologists. I did a ton of reviewing before purchasing this, but now I am at a loss.</li>
    <li> Finding a good sunscreen is really difficult for me. At 60 I still break out with a lot of products (including lightweight moisturizers) and yet I&#x27;m also fighting dry skin! Besides that, a lot of sunscreens run into my eyes and cause burning. Still, I feel it&#x27;s extremely important to use a good sunscreen. I wear it year around and it&#x27;s especially important to me during summer months when I&#x27;m outside a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on a bit heavy, although not nearly as much as some of their other sunscreens. It also starts out somewhat white, but that goes away with careful application. In other words, don&#x27;t rub a handful onto your face all at once. Start with smaller amounts and do it by sections (as in forehead, chin, cheeks, etc.). The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is it makes my face very shiny, but otherwise, it&#x27;s comfortable, doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and I don&#x27;t break out from it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does a nice job. A bit concerned when I put it on my face as it appears white because it has zinc oxide but it blends in fast. My dermatologist suggested this.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin though, after Putting it on, I feel fresh. This is the best I have had before</li>
    <li> OK. So I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but I really like it! It&#x27;s not very thick or sticky. Doesn&#x27;t leave a very white residue. Washes off fairly easily. Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like other facial sunscreens have. It is a little pricey, but so far I think it&#x27;s worth it. Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it under makeup yet and I&#x27;m not an expert, but I don&#x27;t foresee any issues.</li>
    <li> Only brand I have found that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes when sweating.  But it does turn your face blue for a while.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best sunscreen that I have ever used. I used to ride horses competitively and I was always on the lookout for an effective sunscreen that was good for sports.It was impossible to find and I spent a fortune in the process.I have a lot of sun damage on my face and neck and I don&#x27;t want anymore. I don&#x27;t ride horses anymore but I have become a long distance runner. I am therefore still out in the sun for very long periods of time. This sunblock protects well, doesn&#x27;t sting,doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes or mouth, doesn&#x27;t make your face purple when you put it on, doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes yellow and no it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  It doesn&#x27;t contain parabens and its inexpensive.I think that covers all of my requirements for a sunblock.  I believe it has some other skin care properties also, and when I wash it off my skin looks really nice.  I use the sports version for the rest of my body. I have not had a sunburn since I started using Blue Lizard.  the packaging makes it look like a low quality product, not believe me it is amazing. It would take a lot to convince me to try anything else. well done Blue Lizard!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Great price, Not greasy at all. Good under makeup too.</li>
    <li> Nice, light feeling on face.</li>
    <li> great stuff - good price</li>
    <li> I know some people have complained about the white sheen, but I&#x27;m so pale, the whiteness just disappears into my skin. It was fun/slightly scary putting the bottle out in the sunlight and watching it instantly turn blue. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face for maybe a month now, and it seems to work great, and my skin is ok with it too.</li>
    <li> Daughter is lifeguard and feel very confidence with her being on the beach and being protected with this product</li>
    <li> Lasts so much longer than other sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for me.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen, you must buy this, if you don&#x27;t, worry about a lifetime of sunscreen nightmares--I love this so much!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sunblock without all of the nasty ingredients. I have very fair skin, and at this point in my life want to wear sunscreen every day. The problem with a lot of the more natural sunscreens, is that they tend to be hard to blend on your skin, because of the consistency of the zinc. Enter Blue Lizard! I wear this one my face every day; I put it on after my face lotion. It blends really evenly and smoothly. Because it tends to mask any red pigmentation in your skin, I found I no longer needed to wear any sort of foundation or powder. And another amazing, un-looked for benefit-it keeps my skin blemish free! I have always been troubled by small blemishes. My skin is very sensitive, and I found it annoying that as I began to get older and small lines started to form on my face, I was still dealing with teenage acne! But once I started using blue lizard every day, I no longer had that issue. I don&#x27;t know why it works, but I&#x27;m not going to look a gift horse in the mouth!&lt;br /&gt; To be honest, I&#x27;ve been using it only through the end of summer till the beginning of spring, so I can&#x27;t judge yet its true efficacy as a sunblock. But I&#x27;m about to go to Mexico, so if it doesn&#x27;t hold up on that end, I&#x27;ll come back here and let you know!</li>
    <li> This is the only brand of sunscreen we use and I have had my brush with skin cancer.  There is no other sunscreen that we have found that protects you as well as Blue Lizard.  You can tell a difference when out in the sun when you have this on and you know you are being protected.  This brand is recommended by EWG and it is the only brand we use or recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and had given up hope of finding a sunscreen that worked for me.  Blue Lizard Face Sunscreen feels great on my face and actually improves the look and feel of my skin.  Other sunscreens hurt or itched, and immediately made my face red and blotchy.  With Blue Lizard, I can golf again and not worry about my face!</li>
    <li> This sun are product is amazing. It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or messy. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen for my sensitive skin.  I have Lupus and sun protection is essential, and this does the trick!  It is never greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have that weird sunscreen smell.</li>
    <li> Face lotion goes on easily.  Body lotion takes more rubbing.  No awful sunscreen smell.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> This goes on smoothly, do not need much. Do not like chemical sunscreens, so I went with this type. I&#x27;m prone to skin cancer, so my doctor recommended a few brands. None were carried in my local stores. I opted for this.</li>
    <li> I always use Blue Lizard face every day of the year under my makeup.  Most sun damage occurs daily after brief sun exposure.  Blue Lizard face goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t greasy, and hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores or caused any breakouts.  For the beach I usually use either sensitive or regular however to make sure my face has extra protection that will not wash off in the salt water.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of sunblock. This one truly works. I put this on my son&#x27;s face while my sister put Neutrogena Spf 70 on her daughter&#x27;s face. Both kids went to soccer camp from 9 am - 1 pm. My son came home with barely tanned face while my niece&#x27;s face was deeply tanned and red and started peeling the next day. Needless to say, my sister has been buying this for her whole family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin. Personally, this Face formula irritates my skin. I use Blue Lizard Sensitive formula instead. It is whitish as with all titanium and zinc oxide formulations. Sometimes I apply a light layer of foundation over it.</li>
    <li> My Doctor recommended this stuff and I do admit, it is much better than the big-name-brand stuff I&#x27;ve been using to protect my face, nose and ears.  I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
    <li> I have spent years trying to find a sunscreen product that would allow me to spend time in the sun without burning or breaking out in a sun-related rash.  I bought this product before going on a week-long vacation in Florida and I had more fun than ever on the beach without worrying about burning or rashes.  When you first apply the lotion, it appears a whitish color, but it blends in fairly quickly and easily.  It doesn&#x27;t feel too thick or sticky on your skin either.  Lasts a long time, too.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the product 5 stars is that it is not waterproof. As long as I stayed out of the water, I was fine.  Great product for every day use.</li>
    <li> Like this product.  Goes on well and doesn&#x27;t leave a major white film on the face.  I also like the fact that it does not contain parabens.  I am satisfied with this product and will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have tried at least a dozen major brand sunscreens on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin (auburn hair, very white skin) and they all burned when she was in the sun and pool. Blue Lizard is the FIRST one that does exactly what it is supposed to do without any irritation. It is truly an excellent product. Also, a little bit goes a long way--it spreads very well.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I haven&#x27;t found any sunscreen that works better, and the best part is it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
