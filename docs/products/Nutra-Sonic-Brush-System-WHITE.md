      <li>skin is doing awesome.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it in the shower too, and the body attachment is great.</li>
      <li>I decided on Dr Hauscka, which is a great organic product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, great product for what you spend on it.</li>
      <li>I purchased the nutrasonic and this is a great item.</li>
      <li>I am not at all happy with Payless or the nutrasonic sent by them.</li>
      <li>great gift idea.</li>
      <li>I had purchased two for my daughters, one went away to college, when she came home her skin looked great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
      <li>Why in the world has anyone given this a good review?</li>
      <li>Worked great refreshing our skin.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the nutrasonic face brush system.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
      <li>I see no reason to spend more on the Clairsonic!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it, I guarantee it!</li>
      <li>They are both amazing products that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>I really liked this brush system.</li>
      <li>Before I invested that kind of money, I wanted to do some research.  </li>
      <li>Seems the lower speeds provide deeper cleansing, while the faster speed is good for polishing the top of the skin.  </li>
      <li>I can kind of tell just by feel, but having instructions that I could understand would be nice.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, excellent item.</li>
      <li>The Nutra Sonic Face Brush System is my new best friend!  </li>
      <li>Ladies, we all deserve something that makes us feel better and this is that product.  </li>
      <li>Would buy more if I needed them...</li>
      <li>My experience is that the Clarisonic is better.  </li>
      <li>I came here, like I do for most of my purchases, to see if i could find something</li>
      <li>What I love about it:    </li>
      <li>Even being charged appropriately it will not vibrate any more.  </li>
      <li>I just stick with the body brush in the shower most of the time anyway.</li>
      <li>I think make-up even looks better on my skin now.</li>
      <li>I think it would work better with a more foamy cleanser, but I have not tried anything</li>
      <li>However, if you are looking for something that just cleans the heck out of your face (ie - all makeup GONE), then this is a phenomenal product.  </li>
      <li>Love the brush and speed selection.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the results it has had on my skin.</li>
      <li>my skin looks soooo much better...</li>
      <li>I simply Love it, 4 speed is a plus(3th setting jitter-my favorite</li>
      <li>, we would have never known that it was supposed to work much better</li>
      <li>So far so good!    </li>
      <li>Face feels and looks very clean.</li>
      <li>The motor seems more precise, and the product seems better built.  </li>
      <li>My pores have been large forever and all over my face -- this gadget really makes a difference and is so easy to use -- great investment!</li>
      <li>It seems to have done a lot more for everyone else, but I still love this for the fact that my face is so darn clean and smooth afterwards.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of funny, you can tell I&#x27;m using the Nutra Sonic, because you can hear my sneezes all through the house.  </li>
      <li>This product was awesome for a little while, and then the unit refused to hold a charge.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a great product that I use daily.</li>
      <li>BUT, I am extremely pleased after the first week.  </li>
      <li>I have never felt skin this clean before.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell a drastic difference in my skin yet, but I do like how clean it feels.</li>
      <li>I bought it for X-mas and started using it right away just to see how it works, can&#x27;t stop using it since!</li>
      <li>After reading many posts, the Nutrisonic sounded very comparible but a lot cheaper.</li>
      <li>Not expecting, don&#x27;t love as much:    </li>
      <li>Seems like I&#x27;m not breaking out quite as much and lotion soaks in better.</li>
      <li>Like so many, I looked at the Clarisonic but didn&#x27;t want to pay that much.</li>
      <li>My skin feels fresh, clean, and so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My makeup is going on more smoothly as well (I use bare escentuals).    </li>
      <li>I was thrilled when I opened the box and found a manual that explained how and when to charge it and included troubleshooting tips (none of which I have had to use, but just noting here b/c it was so different than the reviews had said).</li>
      <li>This product makes my skin feel exactly the same, and my wallet feels much better!</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time last night and LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>The price was right.</li>
      <li>Exfoliation is wonderful, but those darn blackheads are not disappearing, and that makes me kind of disappointed with this product.  </li>
      <li>Its a great little machine, a lot larger, heavier, and a lot more powerful than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>I think this is a very smart design.    </li>
      <li>From the first use I felt my skin cleaner and fresh.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it does anything to reduce my wrinkles, but I COMPLETELY agree that it preps skin beautifully to accept your product, which can help reduce the wrinkles (or other problems).</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
      <li>I was thinking of buying a similar product from one of my favorite beauty supply chains, where they have the thing priced at almost $200.</li>
      <li>Seems more who bought the BLUE said they had the battery problem.      </li>
      <li>The brush was working well for its job the first 2 months or so, and I enjoyed it very much as my first facial brush.</li>
      <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]].</li>
      <li>I read a lot of reviews here on clarisonic and nutrasonic, and finally picked this one given the price and overall good reviews.</li>
      <li>I think I would like it better if it did both, but that is not a professional opinion.</li>
      <li>I also questioned right up front if this was a new product.  </li>
      <li>The value is AMAZING compared to the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brand out there that is so much more expensive.</li>
      <li>- USE IN THE SHOWER - very convenient.  </li>
      <li>After 1 minute, the red light blinks and product quits.</li>
      <li>However, after only 2 months of use, the charger light stopped working.</li>
      <li>I would guess some did not follow the instructions to charge for 24 hrs straight before use, while some did.  </li>
      <li>For those of you with sensitivity, make sure you are using the sensitive brush on the low setting and do not push the bristles into your face--just let the brush glide gently over your skin.</li>
      <li>how much dirt and grime could be on someone&#x27;s face.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>Theoretically a nice product, but it started acting up after only two months.  </li>
      <li>So after about 30 hrs, I removed it from the charge, then immediately placed it back on, and the light was steady.  </li>
      <li>Knowing how to use it came from what I&#x27;d read on the internet, although I have to say that using it is very easy and intuitive, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure which of the four speeds is which.</li>
      <li>After some complaint, Amazon.com agreed to issue me a credit for $15 on their own, but I thought others should know of Face Medix</li>
      <li>important difference between this and other face cleansing systems.    </li>
      <li>NOT AT ALL like a new product</li>
      <li>would definately recommend this to anyone who wants a fresher feeling complexion, especially to anyone who wants to get the clarisonic but feels it is too costly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using for a week on the same first charge.  </li>
      <li>I have struggled with adult acne for years!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There have been complaints that the brushes are too rough, but if you follow the directions and apply lightly to skin, it is not rough at all.</li>
      <li>I found it was a much smoother result, since the hairs were all above the skin after exfoliating.    </li>
      <li>As far as I can tell it works just as well</li>
      <li>I almost felt the Payless units are some gray market rejects, perhaps explaining the frequent complaints of malfunctioning units.  </li>
      <li>Like the old saying goes</li>
      <li>Switching brushes while in the shower is kind of difficult, but if you wrap a washcloth around the brush, it helps you grip it and makes changing brushes while showering much easier.</li>
      <li>I have normal combination skin with some adult acne on the upper cheek bones.  </li>
      <li>You definately need a little more moisturizer for the first couple of weeks as it will be a little drying initially.</li>
      <li>I would like to send this back to them, I think they should replace it with a new one, considering the price I had to pay.  </li>
      <li>I since decided to use Costco to buy a new unit and discovered the two were manufactured somewhat differently.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews here on clarisonic and nutrasonic, and finally picked this one given the price and overall good reviews. The brush was working well for its job the first 2 months or so, and I enjoyed it very much as my first facial brush. However, after only 2 months of use, the charger light stopped working. The brush itself felt hot when placed on the charger, and apparently failed to be charged again. Very disappointing. Quality not reliable and regret buying it. And DO NOT buy it from FaceMedix. They have terrible post-sale customer service and refuse to send replacement after 30 days of purchase.</li>
    <li> The Nutrasonic system is absolutely terrific, but I cannot thank Payless Beauty for delivering that result.  The unit they sent worked erratically, for two weeks before stopping altogether.  I have been trying to return it ever since with no success.  The Payless toll-free number is in fact a fax number, which tells you something about their focus on the customer.  I since decided to use Costco to buy a new unit and discovered the two were manufactured somewhat differently.  The Costco unit battery charger is made up of the base and plug unit as one solid entity, the Payless cord detaches and looks more flimsy.  The Costco unit has English instructions, the Payless has only Spanish???  I almost felt the Payless units are some gray market rejects, perhaps explaining the frequent complaints of malfunctioning units.  That said, when it works, it is truly a remarkable tool to exfoliate the face and remove dead skin from difficult body areas like the elbows.  My elbows have looked terrible for years and no amount of body cream would help.  A few days with the body attachment, used in the shower for just a minute on each elbow, and voila!  My elbows are now starting to look normal again and the layers of dead skin are almost gone.  Bottom line, I would recommend you go elsewhere to secure the unit, the inferior construction and lousy customer service at Payless are really aggravating and not worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the nutra sonic because of the price.  Like the old saying goes you get what you pay for. I had purchased two for my daughters, one went away to college, when she came home her skin looked great. When she used the one we had in the house she told us it was not working correctly. You could see the difference when you saw the two together, we would have never known that it was supposed to work much better had we not had the second one. When I called customer service they willing to fix it but not willing to pay for the postage. So back to the store they both go.</li>
    <li> I purchased the nutrasonic and this is a great item. Face feels and looks very clean.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the nutrasonic face brush system. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect in comparison to the clarisonic pro, which I seriously considered buying after my esthetician used it on me before a facial. As far as I can tell it works just as well and it is a lot less expensive. It doesn&#x27;t have the timer like the clarisonic, but I think that is the only major difference.  I can&#x27;t tell a drastic difference in my skin yet, but I do like how clean it feels. I was a little disappointed that the brush only oscilates, thought it was going to run in a circular motion as well. I think I would like it better if it did both, but that is not a professional opinion. I have read a few reviews that say the brushes are rough. I struggle with acne, but my skin is not sensitive, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt or bother me.  I can see where it would be a little harsh on very sensitive skin, but there is a sensitive skin brush as well, which I haven&#x27;t tried. I have seen a tiny improvement in the amount of blemishes, but I am also using a strict skin care regimen along with it.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding facial washes to go with it... I have been using the ones I already had...max clarity deep cleasing foam and dermacleanse facial cleansing gel. I think it would work better with a more foamy cleanser, but I have not tried anything but the two listed.  You definately need a little more moisturizer for the first couple of weeks as it will be a little drying initially. I use it every night and every other morning in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I found it a little \\&quot;much\\&quot; to use it every single morning.&lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend this to anyone who wants a fresher feeling complexion, especially to anyone who wants to get the clarisonic but feels it is too costly.</li>
    <li> The Nutra Sonic Face Brush System is my new best friend!  I have never felt skin this clean before.  It&#x27;s amazing!  I had no idea how much dirt and grime could be on someone&#x27;s face.  Ladies, we all deserve something that makes us feel better and this is that product.  I would add this to my Christmas list if I were you!  You&#x27;ll love it, I guarantee it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Nutrasonic for one month now. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it. I&#x27;m pleased with the results it has had on my skin. I use it to wash my face every morning and my skin is noticeably smoother now. I am only giving it four stars instead of five because I have a few small complaints. First, mine has a tendency to arbitrarily shut off for a second or two while I&#x27;m using it. If I give it a little shake or hold it at a different angle it&#x27;ll go right back on. Second, it splatters water/cleanser big time. I solved this problem by holding a hand mirror and bending over my bathtub while washing my face with it. Kind of annoying, but at least now I don&#x27;t mess up my bathroom mirror every time I use my Nutrasonic. I&#x27;ve used it in the shower too, and the body attachment is great. Switching brushes while in the shower is kind of difficult, but if you wrap a washcloth around the brush, it helps you grip it and makes changing brushes while showering much easier. Again, kind of annoying, but not a huge deal. I just stick with the body brush in the shower most of the time anyway. My last complaint is that the instructions that came with mine are ONLY in Spanish. Maybe this was a fluke that was specific just to the one I happened to get. (I ordered mine from Payless Beauty seller, not sure if that has anything to do with it?) But yeah, the glossy folded instruction sheet was ENTIRELY in Spanish, no English to be found ANYWHERE, trust me I looked. Knowing how to use it came from what I&#x27;d read on the internet, although I have to say that using it is very easy and intuitive, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure which of the four speeds is which. I can kind of tell just by feel, but having instructions that I could understand would be nice.</li>
    <li> A few months ago I bought a Clairsonic Mia. I took it back after a few weeks because even though my skin felt softer, I just couldn&#x27;t deal with the price. The other day I stumbled upon this product. I used it for the first time last night and LOVE IT! The only difference is that the outside row of bristles does move, where the Clairsonic doesn&#x27;t. This just means that you should put in against your face before you turn it on. It also does not have a built in timer. But I actually prefer that since 2 minutes is actually a little too long for my skin. All and all I see no reason to spend more on the Clairsonic! This product makes my skin feel exactly the same, and my wallet feels much better!</li>
    <li> I have only use it for a week and the results are visible. From the first use I felt my skin cleaner and fresh. I totally recommended.</li>
    <li> After reading multiple reviews and comparing this item against the Clarisonic, I decided to purchase the Nutrasonic Face Brush.  The sonic action worked properly and cleaned my face very well, however, the brush would only stay charged for one short use, and then it would have to be recharged.  The description says the brush should stay charged for at least a week.  I contacted Face Medix, who agreed to accept the item for return, however, they required me to pay the return shipping, which was $15 (Face Medix required insurance &amp; tracking).  I did not believe I should pay $15 return shipping on an item that was damaged upon receipt.  After some complaint, Amazon.com agreed to issue me a credit for $15 on their own, but I thought others should know of Face Medix return policy on their items.  A+ to Amazon.com as always.  Very poor grade to Face Medix.  After returning the Nutrasonic, I purchased the Clarisonic brush.  I don&#x27;t care what the reviewers say.  My experience is that the Clarisonic is better.  The motor seems more precise, and the product seems better built.  In this case, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have been drooling over the Clarisonic for about 2 1/2 years.  Couldn&#x27;t afford it for a long time, and so I finally bought the Nutra Sonic, based on everyone&#x27;s reviews.          What I love about it:    * It cleans ALL the makeup off my face  * It gets rid of all the dull, flaky dry skin on my face (I live in the desert, so my face is always flaking somewhere, because of how dry it is here)    Not expecting, don&#x27;t love as much:    * Blackheads are not gone.  From everyone&#x27;s reviews, it seemed like my blackheads would go away promptly (I have combination skin, with some blackheads on my nose and chin).    * The fact that I sneeze everytime I use this!  It&#x27;s kind of funny, you can tell I&#x27;m using the Nutra Sonic, because you can hear my sneezes all through the house.  It tickles my nose SO BADLY, and whenever I go over my nose, it triggers an onset of sneezes.  No one else forewarned me - so count yourself warned!        Exfoliation is wonderful, but those darn blackheads are not disappearing, and that makes me kind of disappointed with this product.  However, if you are looking for something that just cleans the heck out of your face (ie - all makeup GONE), then this is a phenomenal product.  It seems to have done a lot more for everyone else, but I still love this for the fact that my face is so darn clean and smooth afterwards.  I will recommend this product in a heartbeat, but not if you&#x27;re looking to beat blackheads!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with adult acne for years!  I am 33 and have tried everything on the market, including prescription products. I visited my local organic salon to see if they had any products that I haven&#x27;t tried yet, and the salesgirl recommended a Clarisonic brush...retail $199.00. Before I invested that kind of money, I wanted to do some research.  After reading many posts, the Nutrisonic sounded very comparible but a lot cheaper. I decided to give it a try.  Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say that I also decided to switch my skincare regime at the same time. I decided on Dr Hauscka, which is a great organic product.  I started using both products on Monday, and I have seen a decrease in my acne by 90% in 4 days.  They are both amazing products that I would recommend to anyone. I use the nutrisonic every day for about 1-2 minutes in the shower and that is it. My skin feels fresh, clean, and so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been complaints that the brushes are too rough, but if you follow the directions and apply lightly to skin, it is not rough at all. It stays charged for about a week so I am going to keep mine in the shower and charge on Sundays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Just wanted to write b/c I have had this product for about 4 months and it&#x27;s been terrific. Like so many, I looked at the Clarisonic but didn&#x27;t want to pay that much. I opted to go with this product but felt nervous since reviews said it didn&#x27;t come with any sort of manual and that it wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge after a month. I was thrilled when I opened the box and found a manual that explained how and when to charge it and included troubleshooting tips (none of which I have had to use, but just noting here b/c it was so different than the reviews had said). It&#x27;s been a great product that I use daily. I don&#x27;t think it does anything to reduce my wrinkles, but I COMPLETELY agree that it preps skin beautifully to accept your product, which can help reduce the wrinkles (or other problems). I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Why in the world has anyone given this a good review? This product was awesome for a little while, and then the unit refused to hold a charge. It would literally work for about 20 seconds and then die. Charging it did not help whatsoever. Do yourself a favor and buy the $25 [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]. It does the same thing, costs 1/4 of this piece of junk, AND you can replace the batteries.</li>
    <li> Theoretically a nice product, but it started acting up after only two months.  Even being charged appropriately it will not vibrate any more.  After 1 minute, the red light blinks and product quits.</li>
    <li> My pores have been large forever and all over my face -- this gadget really makes a difference and is so easy to use -- great investment!</li>
    <li> I bought it for X-mas and started using it right away just to see how it works, can&#x27;t stop using it since! The value is AMAZING compared to the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brand out there that is so much more expensive. This is the exact same thing (minus the timer). Highly recommend, excellent item. I simply Love it, 4 speed is a plus(3th setting jitter-my favorite one)and my skin looks soooo much better...Would buy more if I needed them...great gift idea. For those of you with sensitivity, make sure you are using the sensitive brush on the low setting and do not push the bristles into your face--just let the brush glide gently over your skin. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> I also questioned right up front if this was a new product.  No English instructions.  The silver case also seemed worn.  NOT AT ALL like a new product should be.  I am not at all happy with Payless or the nutrasonic sent by them.</li>
    <li> I researched both the Nutra Sonic and Clarisonic, and decided to purchase the Nutra Sonic.  Here&#x27;s some info I found, and also my impression of the Nutra Sonic after the first week of use:    - BATTERY CHARGE - I charged for 24 hours straight on the base, and the light didn&#x27;t stop blinking.  So after about 30 hrs, I removed it from the charge, then immediately placed it back on, and the light was steady.  I&#x27;ve been using for a week on the same first charge.  So far so good!    I was so concerned about this, because several of the reviews I read complained about the battery.  I would guess some did not follow the instructions to charge for 24 hrs straight before use, while some did.  You also have to face the brush to the charger when placing it in the base.  I bought the WHITE version of the system.  Seems more who bought the BLUE said they had the battery problem.      - SONIC ACTION - Nutra Sonic is also sonic action (it has a \\&quot;jitter\\&quot; / back and forth motion) like the Clarisonic; important difference between this and other face cleansing systems.    - FOUR SPEEDS seemed unnecessary to me, until I used it.  Seems the lower speeds provide deeper cleansing, while the faster speed is good for polishing the top of the skin.  I like to have the option.    - USE IN THE SHOWER - very convenient.  I used the body brush on my calves before using my Emjoi for regular hair removal.  I found it was a much smoother result, since the hairs were all above the skin after exfoliating.    - BRUSHES ARE PROTECTED by a plastic casing with holes in it, which allows excess moisture to drain / dry after use.  I think this is a very smart design.    - IT&#x27;S STURDY.  You can tell by handling it that it&#x27;s not a fragile item.      The jury is still out to a point, because I&#x27;ve only had it for a week.  BUT, I am extremely pleased after the first week.  I have normal combination skin with some adult acne on the upper cheek bones.  After using the cleaning system, my skin is glowing and is muchsmoother.  My makeup is going on more smoothly as well (I use bare escentuals).    Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> We owned our Nutra Sonic for six months. Worked great refreshing our skin. Skin feels cleaner and pores are refined. Love the brush and speed selection. The price was right. Both my husband and I use it daily. Our only complaint has been the quality of the unit&#x27;s charging device. To recharge the systems batteries the unit is placed into the charger overnight which will then hold a charge for about a week depending on usage. But as time has gone on it has become more difficult to charge. It finally stopped. Now we don&#x27;t know what to do. Probably have to replace it :( Still less expensive than Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I was thinking of buying a similar product from one of my favorite beauty supply chains, where they have the thing priced at almost $200. Needless to say, that wasn&#x27;t happening. I came here, like I do for most of my purchases, to see if i could find something cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this and decided to give it a try. Its a great little machine, a lot larger, heavier, and a lot more powerful than I thought it would be. The charge lasts forever. Seriously. I always forget to set it back on the dock, and its still going after like 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is doing awesome. I had some trouble with some hyper-pigmentation from acne, and wanted to use this in conjunction with Strivectin, and its working like crazy. I&#x27;d recommend this, not to mention you get two extra heads for body and sensitive skin (I mean, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but still.); I wish the body head was a little larger, but I&#x27;m sure this is what is average for these types of machines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, great product for what you spend on it.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!! This product does not last a year.  Bought this at Christmas for my daughter and by July it quit working.  I would like to send this back to them, I think they should replace it with a new one, considering the price I had to pay.  Wish I would have read reviews before I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush in the shower every day for a month and I really like it. I feel like it gets my face cleaner than regular washing and my skin feels smoother. Seems like I&#x27;m not breaking out quite as much and lotion soaks in better. I think make-up even looks better on my skin now. I did notice some redness the first few days of use, but that went away after using it regularly for about a week. No issues at all with product quality, battery life, etc. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I really liked this brush system. However, It stopped working after a year. Which is a bummer because that&#x27;s when the warranty runs out. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll repurchase just because I don&#x27;t want the same thing to happen again. I might try a different brand.</li>
