### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for diabetic glucose tablets.</li>
      <li>Excellent seller.  </li>
      <li>Great Product!!</li>
      <li>Very nice for carrying overnight pills or for going out shopping.</li>
      <li>They are very attractive and well-machined, the threaded tops closing easily.</li>
      <li>This container is great for holding 6 or 7 large glucose tablets</li>
      <li>5 star for being a solid and great product!</li>
      <li>This product is perfect for carrying pills or over sized vitamins in extra quantities.</li>
      <li>Who knows how many of my friends told their friends.</li>
      <li>I suppose the better answer would be a plastic top with plastic threads.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better to have your pills with you when you need it.</li>
      <li>I take lots of medication, and it seemed so easy to fill up one of these for an overnight trip instead of toting around a bunch of pill bottles.  </li>
      <li>Just fine in every way, except for the threads when you put the lid on.  </li>
      <li>Perfect size, light weight and probably water tight.</li>
      <li>Great because they&#x27;re more compact than the average pill container.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But, for keeping medicine dry and protected from the environment, it is a great product.</li>
      <li>Good price as well, relative to retail price at store locations.</li>
      <li>The size was excellent as 10 smaller container&#x27;s content will fit into this larger container.</li>
      <li>This container is very large and doesn&#x27;t fit in pockets well.</li>
      <li>Also strong and very water resistant.</li>
      <li>It is waterproof, light weight and is large capacity.</li>
      <li>This product fofilled my expectation and has been a useful addition to my survival kit.</li>
      <li>Keeps them safe, dry and easily</li>
      <li>These little metal pill vials, in both medium and large, are excellent so far.</li>
      <li>BUT it is huge so huge that it looks like pepper spray on my key chain.</li>
      <li>Just exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Not too big or small just perfect</li>
      <li>Worked very well!</li>
      <li>The company should send me a few for free for getting so many people to order them.</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant and they are, really, a bit of fun.</li>
      <li>I bet I&#x27;m directly or indirectly  responsible for over the sale of 50 aluminum pill containers.</li>
      <li>Instead, I put the keyring directly on the lid and its decent.</li>
      <li>Suitable for Senior Citizen&#x27;s use, who must carry emergency medication or when one forgets to take meds but unable to readily access medication bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always finding uses for these because they are so much larger than the ones you normally see on people&#x27;s key chains.  </li>
      <li>Only complaint is the metal triangle that holds on the key ring twists off fairly easily.  </li>

    <li> Keychain comes off every few weeks because I use it so much so I am unable to keep it on my set of keys. But the product is still okay and can store all my pills, but unfortunately it is big and bulky and looks awkward in my pocket. I suggest the company make a stronger keychain so it doesn&#x27;t keep falling apart.</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Excellent seller.  Would purchase from seller again.</li>
    <li> Great because they&#x27;re more compact than the average pill container. Also strong and very water resistant. Have bought 3 containers in all. Have also recommended them to friends that I know have bought over 12. The company should send me a few for free for getting so many people to order them. Who knows how many of my friends told their friends. I even showed my sister who is a nurse and she&#x27;s recommending them to some of her patients. I bet I&#x27;m directly or indirectly  responsible for over the sale of 50 aluminum pill containers.</li>
    <li> Perfect for diabetic glucose tablets. Keeps them safe, dry and easily accessible.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has his attached to his key ring so he has it on him at all times.</li>
    <li> Hmmmm! I was not aware a pill container was educational?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, for keeping medicine dry and protected from the environment, it is a great product. The size was excellent as 10 smaller container&#x27;s content will fit into this larger container. I can throw my medz into the larger and break out into the smaller containers as needed. Great Product!!</li>
    <li> This product arrived damaged, from the shipper.  The bottom of the pill case had numerous scratches; the side had several nicks in the paint and the top/cap was misshapen from poor manufacturing.  The pill case also seems to be larger than the picture indicates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have requested a return, due to the product appearing to be used or very poorly handled prior to shipping.</li>
    <li> Use this to carry glucose tabs for my Type 1 child. Worked very well!</li>
    <li> I use mine for holding my hunting ear plugs.  Only complaint is the metal triangle that holds on the key ring twists off fairly easily.  I&#x27;ve got some string through it now, keeping my eye out for a cable keyring that fits.</li>
    <li> 5 star for being a solid and great product! BUT it is huge so huge that it looks like pepper spray on my key chain.</li>
    <li> Just exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, light weight and probably water tight. It is a practical keeper.</li>
    <li> Just fine in every way, except for the threads when you put the lid on.  There were aluminum filings falling on my vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent an hour opening and closing them over and over to put wear on the threads.  It seemed to help a lot.  I suppose the better answer would be a plastic top with plastic threads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aluminum is linked to Alzheimer&#x27;s, so don&#x27;t bother to reply &amp;#34;what&#x27;s a little aluminum dust?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Way bigger than expected.  Should have ordered medium or small size. Too big for what I needed in fact. It&#x27;s big.</li>
    <li> These little metal pill vials, in both medium and large, are excellent so far. They are very attractive and well-machined, the threaded tops closing easily. The colors are vibrant and they are, really, a bit of fun.</li>
    <li> Finally, a container I can have on my keyring that actually fits my pills!</li>
    <li> Suitable for Senior Citizen&#x27;s use, who must carry emergency medication or when one forgets to take meds but unable to readily access medication bottle. It is waterproof, light weight and is large capacity. Good price as well, relative to retail price at store locations.</li>
    <li> This product fofilled my expectation and has been a useful addition to my survival kit. I would sugest this to anyone seeking a pill container...</li>
    <li> I had this hanging from a backpack, it knocked against something and burst open! A day&#x27;s supply of pills all over the parking lot!</li>
    <li> These came in a set of three; red, blue, and black.  I take lots of medication, and it seemed so easy to fill up one of these for an overnight trip instead of toting around a bunch of pill bottles.  I&#x27;ve also stashed extra cash for emergencies, my medication list for my doctors&#x27; visits, and even stashed jewelry in them at times so I wouldn&#x27;t lose it.  I&#x27;m always finding uses for these because they are so much larger than the ones you normally see on people&#x27;s key chains.  These hold a lot of stuff.  I would definitely order these again.</li>
    <li> Very nice for carrying overnight pills or for going out shopping. Fits on your keys or in a purse. Better to have your pills with you when you need it. Don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for carrying pills or over sized vitamins in extra quantities. Not too big or small just perfect</li>
    <li> This container is great for holding 6 or 7 large glucose tablets</li>
    <li> picture does not do the size justice</li>
    <li> I bought this especially because the picture showed a white insert inside. Product didn&#x27;t have one when received. The quality seems durable. This container is very large and doesn&#x27;t fit in pockets well.</li>
    <li> I work in a water facility and am constantly in and out of the water.  With this beauty, I can carry my meds and never have to worry about it leaking.&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars, but the clip that connects the lid to the key ring didnt last longer than a week before it broke off.  Instead, I put the keyring directly on the lid and its decent.</li>
