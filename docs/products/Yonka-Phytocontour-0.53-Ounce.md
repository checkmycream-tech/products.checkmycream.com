      <li>cannot live without this.  </li>
      <li>whenever i&#x27;ve eaten too much salt, it will show up in puffy eyes the next morning.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t tell much difference except a slight tightening of the skin.</li>

    <li> great product for those mornings when i did not get much sleep.  price good.</li>
    <li> It was my first time using this product and I loved it! I ordered another in a larger size :)</li>
    <li> has terrible smell / fragrance - burns my eyes &amp; makes them watery&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use anything with a strong fragrance on my face.&lt;br /&gt;leaves a sticky, tacky feel on my skin, not a clean feeling @ all.&lt;br /&gt;tried it for 2 days - cannot use this !&lt;br /&gt;already opened it &amp; used out of it a little, threw the envelope away&lt;br /&gt;so I dont know if i can return it or not.&lt;br /&gt;Feel i just spent $40 for nothing !</li>
    <li> I have two milia over one eye and I read that this cream could help with that. There are other options, but this seemed the most gentle. After four weeks of regular use, I can&#x27;t tell any difference in the milia at all. That aside, I still wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. The smell is so unpleasant that I dread using it; it smells just like Vick&#x27;s vap-o-rub. I agree with the reviewer who said it makes eyes sting and water, but that only lasts a few seconds. It does feel somewhat moisturizing, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with fine lines or any kind of change or improvement with my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not terrible eye cream, but I am sure there must be equally effective products that do not cost as much or smell as dreadful.</li>
    <li> Love it, it is the only eye cream I have ever been able to use and I&#x27;ve tried many! No wrinkles here ladies, keeps them at bay!  Have been using for over 10 years.  I love it for my allergic eye, helps to clear them up.  Very light, and hydrating, no oils or heavy cream here.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product from the intense rosemary aroma to the results!  and it helps to get it at a good price and from a seller that delivers quickly!  totally recommend...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, absolutely  fantastic on the eyes, especially during allergy season! I could not imagine using anything else, ever!</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream for me. I tend to get the milia(?) and this keeps that in check. Also it can be reapplied during the day for a pick me up.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different eye cremes over the years and this is by far the best.  It has a lightweight feel and the most fabulous smell.  It reduces puffiness and isn&#x27;t greasy or clumpy.  The smell is a combination of mint and rosemary and I can&#x27;t get enough of it.  I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> whenever i&#x27;ve eaten too much salt, it will show up in puffy eyes the next morning. This cream helps reduce puffiness fast.</li>
    <li> This is the second Yonka product I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;m a fan. I use it in conjunction with Peter Thomas Roth Instant Firmx Eye Tightener in the morning and it&#x27;s amazing. It has a slight tingling sensation and scent that immediately awakens you and has also helped with dark circles. I use it alone at night along with the Yonka Duo and I love it. I recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the quality. Love the smell. Love the results. Love the price but only because it was on sale. I&#x27;d buy it on Amazon again, as my spa sells this only at full price.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion- nothing but the best!</li>
    <li> This picture is not the right one, but this is the best eye cream ever for refreshing your eyes at the beginning or end of the day. Nothing better despite having used about 30 or more different ones. Also the only one that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell much difference except a slight tightening of the skin. It does become a little smoother area for applying makeup.</li>
    <li> The ONLY thing I have found that does not irritate my eyes A+&lt;br /&gt;Have used it for years, so happy they have not discontinued it!</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described and delivered as promised. Thanks!</li>
    <li> cannot live without this.  it is the best eye moisturizer for eyes and eyelids - has no perfumes or irritating ingredients.  i actually get asked what i use for my eyes.  i use this every time that i wash my face.  love love love</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t seen a decrease in fine lines, this product has lessened my milia noticeably! I had heard that there was nothing to do about milia, then I found Yonka Phyto Contour. Great results and well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I really like how it hydrates my skin!&lt;br /&gt; Really gives it a nice glow.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye creams over the years and this one seems to be my favorite.</li>
