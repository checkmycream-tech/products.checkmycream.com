      <li>These were very, very old, and were not Precision Clean, but were Flexisoft, which is a different product.  </li>
      <li>The brush moves left and right</li>
      <li>I really like that I received three brushes, but they do look different than what the picture shows.</li>
      <li>The packaging was old and worn.</li>
      <li>They are simple in design but work very well.</li>

    <li> Great price. These OEM brush heads are great.</li>
    <li> I will Definitely be Purchasing These again it is all that it describes and more They arrived in one day as said because I am a Prime Member. .I recommend these to everyone that has a Oral B  That they will fit</li>
    <li> In our case, the brush needed to be changed less than 2 months (Oral-B recommends every 3 months) but otherwise a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> As good as the original.  They all last a long time too.  I&#x27;d use them for a couple years if my wife would let me.</li>
    <li> The packaging was old and worn. Hard plastic casement around the tooth brush heads smashed so I had to immediately pull the brush heads out so they wouldn&#x27;t be permanently bent.</li>
    <li> works great fits my braun toothbrush. I like the different color rings so I can tell which one is mine.</li>
    <li> These brushes are authentic. I am using it now.&lt;br /&gt;The pricing is reasonable, delivery is on time. Would return to purchase more in future.</li>
    <li> Nice toothbrush heads,no problem changing them out,very good deal if you price shop in the stores.I will buy more of these in the future from you.</li>
    <li> This brush is the real deal from OrbalB. A good brush at a great price.</li>
    <li> GOOD BRUSHED. WILL BUY MORE. GOOD SELLER.</li>
    <li> I was so glad you carried this brush head on your site.  I priced around in the stores in my area, but they were quite expensive.  I can finally change my brush heads without having to worry about spending a lot of money on the replacements.</li>
    <li> These were very, very old, and were not Precision Clean, but were Flexisoft, which is a different product.  Would not recommend this seller since this is deceptive advertising.</li>
    <li> Very good for one&#x27;s dental hygeine.&lt;br /&gt;These tips clean well and don&#x27;t bang against your teeth like the flossng tips.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for about 15 years. My dentist is always impressed by my teeth, and during my annual cleaning he says there is very little for him to do because I have so little plaque build up.</li>
    <li> I really like that I received three brushes, but they do look different than what the picture shows. The brush on the picture is circular and I received the ones shaped like a regular toothbrush. The brush moves left and right and I prefer it to move in a circular motion, it still gets the job done for the price. I would probably order again, but hopefully I get the circular brushes next time.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, it came with 3 and was a quick ship!!  Thank you :-)</li>
    <li> very inexpensive, but the genuine article in actual packaging.</li>
    <li> These are expensive in stores so I got them here. I placed 2 orders and each order (surprising) came with 4 toothbrush heads each. Awesome.</li>
    <li> perfect fit, decent lifetime.  Work better than generic in terms of fit and finish.  Colors were assorted so family members can distinguish theirs</li>
    <li> The product description shows an Oral B box containing 3 brush heads. The “Answered Questions” state 3 brushes to the “how many?” question, as do customer reviews. I received only one brush head,  and it was not packaged as advertised.  Yes, the description title does say brush “head,” not “heads,” but other information throughout the web page states there are 3. I contacted the seller. Hopefully this was a simple mistake in fulfillment.</li>
    <li> We have been using Oral B toothbrushes for a long time. Of the several types of brush heads available,  these have to be our favorite.  They are simple in design but work very well.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads are actual Oral-B and not a generic brand. The package came with three precision clean replacement heads and 1 bonus pro-whitening replacement head. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product, price, and shipping time.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! A lot cheaper then in store.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper on Amazon than our local store ($25 dlls here in the big red T) and these are the originals, so you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> very good gets all the crevices in my tooth and gumline. Don&#x27;t buy the cheap aftermarket stuff they usually don&#x27;t fit right.</li>
    <li> Great price for 3 replacement head.  They coat so much in retail store.  These are genuine products.</li>
