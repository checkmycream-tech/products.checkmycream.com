      <li>Nice scent too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now 34 and so happy that I can finally be comfortable and love my skin.  </li>
      <li>I do have to make sure to put on lotion after I use this, but c&#x27;mon - putting on moisturizer after washing your face is kind of a thing</li>
      <li>I guess you can tell I am a picky customer, which should tell you how wonderful the Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash really is.</li>
      <li>I recommend for sure.</li>
      <li>I love how the product smells and feels on my face.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ve tried most products out there.  </li>

      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I am glad to see it here</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t give more info</li>
      <li>I used Phisoderm and a Buff Puff for more than 20 years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this now so that my kids can use and not have to struggle like me.  </li>
      <li>Often, I have to choose between being able to stand the smell or having my face start to peel from</li>
      <li>Perfect daily cleanser!</li>
      <li>For some reason, the liquid works better and is easier to use for me.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great face wash.</li>
      <li>this leaves no residue, face feels very clean.</li>
      <li>Basis is gentle, moisturizing, inexpensive, and has a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Cleans even waterproof makeup off easily which is a must.</li>
      <li>I have very, very oily skin, and although this product is not specified for oily skin, it is extremely effective for removing excess oil and cleaning out my pores.</li>
      <li>It is, simply, a great face wash with a lovely clean scent that delivers every time; your face is left clean and free of any traces of make-up, dirt or grime</li>
      <li>Basis is Just simple great face wash.</li>
      <li>so far so good</li>
      <li>I only gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because it isn&#x27;t the best for gentle and thorough removal of eye makeup.</li>
      <li>Clears up my skin, and gentle for my sensitive skin yet takes off all my makeup, so good!</li>
      <li>It leaves my face smooth and clean</li>
      <li>Smells fresh and clean too!  </li>
      <li>Then a marketing genius at Phisoderm decided they would push an acne-treatment Phisoderm that stores now stock instead of the original one.  </li>
      <li>I find the products meets my expectations and has a great natural odor, I really like the product.  </li>
      <li>I like the clean smell and the way it lathers.</li>
      <li>It foams well and rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>This cleanser has a great smell and leaves my skin clean but not overly dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for help with my blemish prone, large pored, combination skin for more than 20 years.  </li>
      <li>This is made by the same company that manufactures Nivea, another good brand.</li>
      <li>Even if it looked okay at a glance, when I put makeup on it was very noticeable.</li>
      <li>This is the best cleanser by far because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and absolutely (somehow) clears up my acne quickly.</li>
      <li>I use it every day and my skin feels fresh and clean without oiling up in the summer.</li>
      <li>I feel clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I also appreciate the clean fresh scent.</li>
      <li>This wash is perfect in cleaning impurities gently without leaving my face feeling dried out.</li>
      <li>It really does a fantastic job cleaning the makeup off my face and leaving it clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>This product never fails to leave my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s not really a pair of good options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Helps to get rid of oil and leaves face feeling fresh.</li>
      <li>Put about a nickle sized dollop on my fingertips and rub it into my face, then gently rinse by wiping off with a warm soft washcloth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, Basis is great and it has a mild enough smell that I&#x27;m not left holding my breath from my own facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for the basis can give more radiant and very soft to my face..</li>
      <li>Breakouts while using this product have been minimal, and I love the fresh, light scent.</li>
      <li>And the best part, when you rinse it off it does not leave your skin dry and tight.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t fond of that at first but have come to get used to it.</li>
      <li>Love this facial wash</li>
      <li>After reading that alternating cleansers was better for your skin than using the same one every day, I decided to try this one for every-other-day use.</li>
      <li>Have only used it for a week or so, but it seems to work ok.  </li>
      <li>Used with a Buff Puff, Basis will keep your skin soft, silky, and clean.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves my skin squeaky clean and petal soft.</li>
      <li>Its mild  and not harsh.</li>
      <li>Really cleans the face...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so gentle</li>
      <li>how much you rinse.</li>
      <li>Gentle on skin AND cleans off makeup (even hard-to-remove eye makeup).  </li>
      <li>I often put my face under the shower faucet for a brief 2-3 second rinse after that, too, which I know many skincare professionals discourage, but I find I get a better rinse that way, especially in the area where my face meets my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really cleans your skin without drying it.</li>
      <li>and I will be ordering 6 tubes very soon.</li>
      <li>- now I really don&#x27;t need it at all.  </li>
      <li>Cleaner Clean Face Wash is the only cleanser I will use.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this long term but it makes my face feel pretty fresh for a number of hours.  </li>
      <li>When my favorite product changed their formula and my face no longer agreed with it, I was left scrambling for something different.</li>

    <li> Clears up my skin, and gentle for my sensitive skin yet takes off all my makeup, so good!</li>
    <li> Great stuff I love using it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My skin is acne prone but also very sensitive, and the Basis cleaner doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. Works well at removing my makeup, too.</li>
    <li> Its mild  and not harsh. It leaves my face smooth and clean</li>
    <li> Basis face wash is the best and smells amazing. This product never fails to leave my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for help with my blemish prone, large pored, combination skin for more than 20 years.  I&#x27;m now 34 and so happy that I can finally be comfortable and love my skin.  I think I&#x27;ve tried most products out there.  Most of my time spent thinking that I needed something strong, with multiple steps to conquer my horrible skin.  I wish I had known all along that it could be so simple.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for the last couple of months, my skin has completely cleared up.  My pores have almost disappeared.  I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wash my oily face halfway through the day.  I feel clean and fresh.  The cleaner smells great and does an awesome job of removing the impurities without overdrying.  I used to have a love hate relationship with moisturizer - now I really don&#x27;t need it at all.  My skin is finally in balance.  I&#x27;m glad I found this now so that my kids can use and not have to struggle like me.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Cleaner Clean Face Wash is the only cleanser I will use. I have sensitive skin and have tried several different cleansers. Either they do not clean my skin sufficiently, or they cause a chemical burn that looks and feels terrible. Basis does a great job of cleaning my oily skin and is extremely gentle. I also appreciate the clean fresh scent. It is not overpowering as so many products are today. It does not interfere with my perfume and I don&#x27;t walk around smelling the residue on my skin all day either. I guess you can tell I am a picky customer, which should tell you how wonderful the Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash really is. I used to buy this at Walmart or Target, but in their infinite wisdom they quit carrying it in favor of products that do not work nearly as well. I am glad to see it here and I will be ordering 6 tubes very soon. I don&#x27;t ever want to run out!</li>
    <li> In the winter I use a creamier Pond&#x27;s cleanser, but I like this to strip oil, sweat and general ick and dirt off my skin during the hot season. This is made by the same company that manufactures Nivea, another good brand. I only gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because it isn&#x27;t the best for gentle and thorough removal of eye makeup. I also like to use this on my chest/shoulders/back to remove oil and sweat.</li>
    <li> basics is a great product I loved because I have found is that from now on I will have more beautiful skin than I had and I have a few days using it and the change is remarkable zero fat and pimples</li>
    <li> I used Phisoderm and a Buff Puff for more than 20 years.  Then a marketing genius at Phisoderm decided they would push an acne-treatment Phisoderm that stores now stock instead of the original one.  I tried the new Phisoderm and it made my face peel, which was gruesome.  I had to find a new face wash and found this one.  Basis is gentle, moisturizing, inexpensive, and has a pleasant fragrance.  Used with a Buff Puff, Basis will keep your skin soft, silky, and clean.  Plus, I like to squeeze tube.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin so its very difficult to find a face wash that is mild enough not to overdry my skin and rough enough to take out the dirt and oil. This one solved my dillema. I use it every day and my skin feels fresh and clean without oiling up in the summer. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I love how it smells and foams. It dries my face out so I know it&#x27;s cleansing. But it kinda sucks that it dries my face out</li>
    <li> I brought this for my daughter and the scent is nice and since she just started using it I can&#x27;t give more info just yet&lt;br /&gt;but so far so good</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 2 weeks now, no problems with skin irritation or breaking out. Helps to get rid of oil and leaves face feeling fresh. Nice scent too. Good product, comparable to Dermalogica&#x27;s face wash and A LOT CHEAPER!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use any other face wash! Cleans even waterproof makeup off easily which is a must. Gentle on the skin and does not dry it out. Perfect daily cleanser!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used a super harsh acne face wash to keep the zits at bay. When my favorite product changed their formula and my face no longer agreed with it, I was left scrambling for something different. I decided I wanted to try something a little gentler on my face to address some of my dry skin issues. I started using this at night before bed and was skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy have I been impressed! I love how the product smells and feels on my face. I used to dread my nighttime face washing routine and now I look forward to the few moments where I close my eyes and pretend like I&#x27;m at a spa! It really does a fantastic job cleaning the makeup off my face and leaving it clean and fresh. So far my face hasn&#x27;t broken out. It hasn&#x27;t dried my face in the way that my old product did. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great face wash.</li>
    <li> I started using this when I developed allergies to certain skin products.  The store where I used to buy it quit selling the liquid and only the bar soap.  For some reason, the liquid works better and is easier to use for me.  Good for people with skin allergies.</li>
    <li> Loooove it! But Walmart sells it cheaper $3.95. Great for oily skin</li>
    <li> This stuff is thick &amp; needs to dilute with water.  Works well for oily skin.  Since I have hard-well water (pH over 8.6), I thin out this soap with vinegar .. that&#x27;s the trick I learned from psoriasis forum.  Normal skin pH is slightly acidic, and putting vinegar in soap &amp; shampoo helps to soften my skin, and soften my hair.  We don&#x27;t soften our hard-water with salt since it&#x27;s bad for our blood-pressure.</li>
    <li> After reading that alternating cleansers was better for your skin than using the same one every day, I decided to try this one for every-other-day use. How I use it: Put about a nickle sized dollop on my fingertips and rub it into my face, then gently rinse by wiping off with a warm soft washcloth. I often put my face under the shower faucet for a brief 2-3 second rinse after that, too, which I know many skincare professionals discourage, but I find I get a better rinse that way, especially in the area where my face meets my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basis is a thinnish gel consistency which feels great to the touch, and has a wonderful scent. It cleans well, though I found it wasn&#x27;t very good at taking off makeup. For days when I don&#x27;t wear makeup, it&#x27;s just fine, but when trying to take off the usual foundation and powder, some was always left behind and I had to grab a second cleanser. For the usual oil, dust, etc., though, it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a slick feeling to the skin after you use it, which doesn&#x27;t come off no matter how much you rinse. I wasn&#x27;t fond of that at first but have come to get used to it. That alone was enough to make me decide not to buy a second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the biggest problem was for the more delicate skin under and around my eyes. I&#x27;m 42 so my under-eye skin has definitely had changes since I was younger, and it&#x27;s much less able to take a strong cleanser. Basis left red patches in the under-eye area near the nose, and though moisturizer helped, there were dry flakes left behind. Even if it looked okay at a glance, when I put makeup on it was very noticeable. I avoid that area now and it&#x27;s all good -- my forehead, chin and nose were the oiliest parts anyway -- but unless your entire face is oily, this may not be the cleanser for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed because the price, the consistency and the scent are perfect, but there are just too many cons for me to buy a second time.</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash! Really cleans the face...I mean deep clean, without over-drying of course. I recommend for sure. Great!</li>
    <li> Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash is one of the best products on the market.  It is, simply, a great face wash with a lovely clean scent that delivers every time; your face is left clean and free of any traces of make-up, dirt or grime but it does not strip the skin of it&#x27;s natural oils.  I have used it now for probably 5 years or so.  Sometimes it is hard to find in drugstores but Amazon thankfully always has it.</li>
    <li> This cleanser has a great smell and leaves my skin clean but not overly dry.</li>
    <li> Basis is Just simple great face wash. Use it everyday! How come they don&#x27;t seem to be in stores anymore??</li>
    <li> I have cystic acne... and scarring to boot.  This is the best cleanser by far because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and absolutely (somehow) clears up my acne quickly.</li>
    <li> I find the products meets my expectations and has a great natural odor, I really like the product.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 weeks and the container seems to be bottomless.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of good reviews about this product, but I was skeptical once I started using it. It felt like it wasn&#x27;t doing anything. A couple days to a week went by and I was noticing visibly clearer skin. I sound like a facial cleanser advertisement, but this is serious business, people. I highly recommend this product if you have breakout-prone, sensitive combination skin. (P.S. Pair this with Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Clarifying Toner and Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion.)</li>
    <li> Gentle on skin AND cleans off makeup (even hard-to-remove eye makeup).  Smells fresh and clean too!  The problem is that it&#x27;s hard to find in my neck of the woods.  I can only find it at Walmart, and not even at all of the Walmarts.</li>
    <li> It really cleans your skin without drying it. I&#x27;m 38 and have combination skin, and it does a great job for me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long term but it makes my face feel pretty fresh for a number of hours.  I have a bad habit of rubbing my face, and I also work in a deli with a steam oven and it has been making me break out, this is why I bought this, in conjuction with benzoyl peroxide.  Results have been slow but steady, I have not been that consistent in application :/</li>
    <li> I have very, very oily skin, and although this product is not specified for oily skin, it is extremely effective for removing excess oil and cleaning out my pores. Other products I&#x27;ve tried specifically formulated  for oily skin tend to be overly drying and irritate my skin. This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It&#x27;s so gentle, I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s as effective as it is. It also leaves my skin squeaky clean and petal soft. Plus its full of wonderful botanicals. It&#x27;s definately one of the best face washes on the market under 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> Love this facial wash</li>
    <li> My mom always has this in her guest bathroom, and whenever we come to visit I wish we had it at home. I have acne prone skin, but a lot of acne-formula face washes leave my sensitive skin too dry and tight.  This wash is perfect in cleaning impurities gently without leaving my face feeling dried out.</li>
    <li> Lathers really good and feels very  nice.  Not drying and does remove makeup, pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> For no real reason. I did find it a little drying. Gave to a friend and have had no feedback</li>
    <li> My wife and I have different types of problem skin and Basis is the only product we have found that both of us can use.  Dry skin and breakouts are a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the basis can give more radiant and very soft to my face..This product i can introduce to my friends and sister and especially to my husband..Thank you again..Godbless</li>
    <li> Order arrived as promised, on time and wrapped well.</li>
    <li> Really great face wash, it is everything one would want... It cleans dirt, oil, and even makeup off you face with a nice bubbly lather that feels and smells nice. And the best part, when you rinse it off it does not leave your skin dry and tight. The best face wash at an incredible price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I switched over to Basis a couple weeks ago. I have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m really picky about smells, so it&#x27;s hard to find soaps. Often, I have to choose between being able to stand the smell or having my face start to peel from the harsh cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, that&#x27;s not really a pair of good options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Basis is great and it has a mild enough smell that I&#x27;m not left holding my breath from my own facial cleanser. I do have to make sure to put on lotion after I use this, but c&#x27;mon - putting on moisturizer after washing your face is kind of a thing that you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I can&#x27;t subscribe to this item, so it&#x27;s going on my reminder-calendar for when I get close to running out. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes this product because of her sensitive skin.  We appreciate that this product came on time since we were about to run out!  Will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Good product..Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Have only used it for a week or so, but it seems to work ok.  I like the clean smell and the way it lathers.</li>
    <li> Great soap for a good price!</li>
    <li> this leaves no residue, face feels very clean. Makeup comes ooff easily and smells wonderful. They stopped carrying it most places, glad to have found it here.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash for the past few weeks, once daily at night to rinse off my makeup.  It cleans my acne-prone skin without drying it out.  It foams well and rinses clean.  Breakouts while using this product have been minimal, and I love the fresh, light scent.</li>
