### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product, great price!</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and nothing seems to work as good as this one!</li>
      <li>Works great to help make and keep curls in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Great gel and curl amplifier.</li>
      <li>Great hair</li>
      <li>I really do like this product--the best Ihave found, this is the best.  </li>
      <li>The gel smells good, has fairly good hold, and seemed to hold my curls</li>
      <li>/&gt;The type of gel products I look for are those that define my curls but also provide good hold.</li>
      <li>Smells good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it is a great to someone else</li>
      <li>I love this hair product, It smells great</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell to but that is all I can say about it.</li>
      <li>Great for controlling wave on super curly hair.</li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve found by far.</li>
      <li>I found that product to work 10 times better than this.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite curl scrunch.  </li>
      <li>cant argue with the price either... :)</li>
      <li>It also gives my hair a shiny healthy look.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not even sure what type of hair this would be helpful for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>As much as I want to say that this is a great product, I won&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I guess that&#x27;s the case with most kinds of hair gel.</li>
      <li>This turns my wavy hair into sweet curls and i love it!</li>
      <li>With my four year old I use a cheap shea butter leave-in conditioner for moisture and shine and then this keeps his curls and spirals looking great all day.  </li>
      <li>Some of his hair is super fine, but on the top of his head, his hair is a blend of fine and kinky curls.  </li>
      <li>This does the job but the hair putty doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores anymore</li>
      <li>I just used this product this morning right after a shower and it made my hair look MORE frizzy and added no hold whatsoever.</li>
      <li>We like Fructis products overall, this is probably good for some people but my daughter didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
      <li>this product now sits on my counter practically full.</li>
      <li>Another option that is great but slightly pricier is: Sexy Hair Short Sexy Hair</li>
      <li>This product is easy to use and it dries fast.</li>
      <li>Pleasant smelling and reasonable price keeps me coming back to it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a nice low to medium strength</li>
      <li>Mixed Chicks works okay for him, but this is fantastic in that it holds his finer curls without drying out the kinkier ones.  </li>
      <li>Good for &amp;#34;superman curls&amp;#34; or other curl control full-motion hair styles.</li>
      <li>price is also very reasonable.</li>
      <li>It worked pretty well.</li>
      <li>The commercial made it look like it would make my hair more curly...</li>
      <li>It even works through humidity, which normally turns my hair into a frizzball!!</li>
      <li>I look for that bed-hair matte textured-type look on my short curls and the hold of a strong gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Prevents frizzies very well.</li>
      <li>I have really curly hair</li>
      <li>I rely on this product every day with Fructis Curl Gel (cream really) as a finisher.</li>
      <li>I use too much</li>
      <li>I like this as much as Mixed Chicks, but it&#x27;s so much cheaper and keeps both boys in curls despite a full day of headstands, helmets, ball caps, whatever.  </li>
      <li>Mixed Chicks is nicer for my older son in the summer when he&#x27;s sweaty or when we have a more formal event shortly after his hair has been curl.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hard to control how much is good enough.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Garnier Fructis&#x27; mess maker hair putty + power gel disorder (ultra strong hold).</li>
      <li>This keeps my wild curls under fuzz control without any flaking and without making my hair feel as if I had used shellac!</li>
      <li>Garnier makes this exact same gel in a spray bottle.</li>
      <li>So I need something strong to hold it down!</li>
      <li>My 4 year old has lots of curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and this product holds the curl softly without the frizz.  </li>
      <li>My 2 year old also has curly hair, but of a blended texture.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my curls in a natural curl and not crunchy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a male with short, straight hair.</li>
      <li>This works really well, but you can get a tendency to go overboard and put in way too much!</li>
      <li>so I have to be careful about too much product drying it out.  </li>
      <li>I have wave to my hair and it really made it look nice, but the smell is just really bad.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used other very good but unfortunately now discontinued products such as: L&#x27;oreal Studioline Grab, Extreme Texture &amp; Structure, Instant Texture</li>

<li> Apparently I&#x27;m not the smartest tool in the shed.</li>
<li> Stays in for a long time too.  </li>
<li> Apply to wet hair in moderate amounts depending on hair thickness, working through with fingers in a downward motion.</li>
<li> I have LONG straight (some-what thick hair) and it did not work.</li>
<li> I have very frizzy, and thick hair.</li>
<li> I applied the gel while my hair was slightly wet (damp) and scrunched it up.</li>
<li> Actually it&#x27;s not really the product.</li>
<li> Let hair half dry and apply the cream gel smoothing over hair to control frizzies.</li>
<li> Not concrete or stiff.  </li>
<li> We have used Mixed Chicks, but it can be pricey and hard to find in stores.  </li>
<li> I have short thick hair with a curl type somewhere between 2/3a.</li>
<li> I can honestly say this is one of the worst products have ever used.</li>
<li> Not sticky or stiff.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, I usually braid my hair with gel to create curls, so when scrunching didn&#x27;t work, I tried to braid with it.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed because I am a huge fan of Garnier .</li>
<li> and when I put it in in frizzes my hair and then trys to curl the frizziness its hard to explain.</li>
<li> Hard Up</li>
<li> His hair grows in thick, but is thin and wispy at the ends</li>
<li> oh well at least it wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s too expensive on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this for the price.</li>
<li> To bad.</li>
<li> This product is absolutely worthless for my hair type.</li>
<li> It just made my hair nasty.</li>
<li> This stuff is almost horrible.  </li>

    <li> I can honestly say this is one of the worst products have ever used. I have really curly hair and when I put it in in frizzes my hair and then trys to curl the frizziness its hard to explain. I was very disappointed because I am a huge fan of Garnier . this product now sits on my counter practically full. oh well at least it wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy, and thick hair. So I need something strong to hold it down! This turns my wavy hair into sweet curls and i love it! i&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and nothing seems to work as good as this one! It even works through humidity, which normally turns my hair into a frizzball!! Definitely on my repeat buy list!</li>
    <li> I love this hair product, It smells great is leaves my curls in the style that I desire!</li>
    <li> We like Fructis products overall, this is probably good for some people but my daughter didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> I did try to scrunch with this, but it didn&#x27;t work with my hair AT ALL (no curls, just sticky and and stiff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I usually braid my hair with gel to create curls, so when scrunching didn&#x27;t work, I tried to braid with it. It worked pretty well. The gel smells good, has fairly good hold, and seemed to hold my curls ok. I&#x27;ve recently switched to L&#x27;Oreal Evercurl gel (which I LOVE), but there&#x27;s nothing fundamentally wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> As much as I want to say that this is a great product, I won&#x27;t. Actually it&#x27;s not really the product. I&#x27;m sure it is a great to someone else but it just didn&#x27;t work for my hair type. I have LONG straight (some-what thick hair) and it did not work. I applied the gel while my hair was slightly wet (damp) and scrunched it up. It made no difference. It has a nice smell to but that is all I can say about it.</li>
    <li> A bit sticky for a gel! But works well enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male with short, straight hair. I don&#x27;t have any curls whatsoever, before or after using this product, so I think you can forget the \\&quot;curl scrunch\\&quot; aspect, whatever that means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just saw this in the store one day. It was inexpensive, so I bought it, and I&#x27;ve been buying it ever since. It doesn&#x27;t produce a sticky helmet of gel-hair. It&#x27;s just a nice low to medium strength hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use too much I get white dandruff-like flakes, but I guess that&#x27;s the case with most kinds of hair gel.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely worthless for my hair type. I have short thick hair with a curl type somewhere between 2/3a. I just used this product this morning right after a shower and it made my hair look MORE frizzy and added no hold whatsoever. Not even sure what type of hair this would be helpful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The type of gel products I look for are those that define my curls but also provide good hold.

This does the job but the hair putty doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores anymore and it&#x27;s too expensive on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Another option that is great but slightly pricier is: Sexy Hair Short Sexy Hair Hard Up and Slept In-Hard Holding Gel and Texture Cr&amp;egrave;me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve also used other very good but unfortunately now discontinued products such as: L&#x27;oreal Studioline Grab, Extreme Texture &amp; Structure, Instant Texture</li>
    <li> I have never used a curl scrunching gel before. My hair dresser told me to try some. I found this at my local store thought I would give it a try. I have wave to my hair and it really made it look nice, but the smell is just really bad. I will be looking for something else. To bad.</li>
    <li> This works really well, but you can get a tendency to go overboard and put in way too much! Because it&#x27;s a squeeze bottle it&#x27;s hard to control how much is good enough. Garnier makes this exact same gel in a spray bottle. I found that product to work 10 times better than this.</li>
    <li> This keeps my wild curls under fuzz control without any flaking and without making my hair feel as if I had used shellac!</li>
    <li> Great gel and curl amplifier. Prevents frizzies very well. Not sticky or stiff. Smells good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is almost horrible.  It makes your hair feel gross...and then it dries to feel crunchy.</li>
    <li> its hair gel that doesn&#x27;t turn my head into a rock. cant argue with the price either... :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great price!</li>
    <li> My 4 year old has lots of curly hair.  His hair grows in thick, but is thin and wispy at the ends so I have to be careful about too much product drying it out.  We have used Mixed Chicks, but it can be pricey and hard to find in stores.  This summer a friend of mine told me about this and I love it.  My 2 year old also has curly hair, but of a blended texture.  Some of his hair is super fine, but on the top of his head, his hair is a blend of fine and kinky curls.  Mixed Chicks works okay for him, but this is fantastic in that it holds his finer curls without drying out the kinkier ones.  I just wash his hair with Johnson&#x27;s for curly hair and spike his curls with this.  With my four year old I use a cheap shea butter leave-in conditioner for moisture and shine and then this keeps his curls and spirals looking great all day.  I like this as much as Mixed Chicks, but it&#x27;s so much cheaper and keeps both boys in curls despite a full day of headstands, helmets, ball caps, whatever.  Mixed Chicks is nicer for my older son in the summer when he&#x27;s sweaty or when we have a more formal event shortly after his hair has been curl.  For us it lacks the staying power that this has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this for the price.</li>
    <li> Great for controlling wave on super curly hair. Best product I&#x27;ve found by far.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and it dries fast. It also gives my hair a shiny healthy look.&lt;br /&gt;The price is also very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Apparently I&#x27;m not the smartest tool in the shed. The commercial made it look like it would make my hair more curly...but it didn&#x27;t. It just made my hair nasty.</li>
    <li> I rely on this product every day with Fructis Curl Gel (cream really) as a finisher. Apply to wet hair in moderate amounts depending on hair thickness, working through with fingers in a downward motion. Let hair half dry and apply the cream gel smoothing over hair to control frizzies.</li>
    <li> Works like gel should, Holds and stays bouncy.  Not concrete or stiff.  Stays in for a long time too.  Good for &amp;#34;superman curls&amp;#34; or other curl control full-motion hair styles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and will continue to do so.  I&#x27;ve never found anything in its class that I like so well.</li>
    <li> Great hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;This was given to me as a gift and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product--the best Ihave found, this is the best.  Would recommend this to anyone---go for it</li>
    <li> This is my favorite curl scrunch.  Works great to help make and keep curls in my hair.  Pleasant smelling and reasonable price keeps me coming back to it.  Works as well as more expensive scrunches.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this gel for years!  I love it! It leaves my curls in a natural curl and not crunchy.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product holds the curl softly without the frizz.  This is the only hair gel I use now!</li>
