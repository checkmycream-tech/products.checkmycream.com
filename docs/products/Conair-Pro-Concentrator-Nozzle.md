<ol>
      <li>the product is fully functional, fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy that I bought it.</li>
      <li>The part where it connects to the hair dryer fits great</li>
      <li>The concept is great</li>
      <li>Great idea because the concentrator that comes with hair dryers seems to expand with the heat and over time doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
      <li>PRICE IS GREAT.</li>
      <li>Happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>This fit my hairdryer perfectly.  </li>
      <li>you can do better!</li>
      <li>It falls off very easily</li>
      <li>Good thing it was so cheap.</li>
      <li>The top nozzle piece fits perfectly on the normal size Conair dryer.  </li>
      <li>The product was in good shape, arrived quickly, and is durable.</li>
      <li>It is said it would work with most dryers.  </li>
      <li>RATHER THAN DESCRIBING THE ATTACHMENT AS FITTING MOST HAIR DRYERS</li>
      <li>This fit my old Conair blow dryer perfectly and easily.</li>
      <li>and I was able to  barely fit it in but ended up braking it.</li>
      <li>The description read like it would fit most, if not all, Conair Pro hair dryers.  </li>
      <li>Easy to just snap on and stays put.</li>
      <li>It fit on my blow dryer just fine.</li>
      <li>Fit one out of four blow dryers I tried to fit it on, and the one it fit on overheated and burnt out because of this nozzle.</li>
      <li>doesnt secure to the hair dryer, it fits but there is nothign to lock it on so</li>
      <li>, I figured this thing would fit</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and thought it would fit</li>
      <li>Considering it&#x27;s a Conair attachment, I assumed it would fit my Conair dryer, which it does not.  </li>
      <li>Since the product description said this fit almost all hair dryers and my hair dryer is made by Conair</li>
      <li>Really cheaply made and I will be returning it.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit the Revlon 1875 Ionic dryer.</li>
      <li>I read reviews and it looked like it would fit my dryer.  </li>
      <li>(I have an ion shine 1875), I assumed it would fit.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my Conair model 1875 hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit a conair hairdryer</li>
      <li>I have 2 Con Air dryers at home and none of them can fit into this nozzle.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my hairdryer</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t fit on my Conair 1875...</li>
      <li>then i pushed it on dryer hard and it fit perfect and stays on too.</li>
      <li>the Good Holiday, especially for conair dryers.</li>
      <li>At first it worked fine.  </li>
      <li>Luckily the store let me return it and considered it a damaged item.  </li>
      <li>How does Conair make a universal nozzle that doesn&#x27;t even fit their own product?&lt;br /&gt;I was flabbergasted.  </li>
      <li>It also gets very hot even on a lower setting.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great for very small dryers...  </li>
      <li>My hairdryer doesn&#x27;t even blow that hot!</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t fit my Revlon dryer, which isn&#x27;t large by any means.</li>
      <li>I still use it because it really does make a difference in how smooth my blowout is.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money... there has to be a better concentrator out there!!</li>
      <li>It flew right off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all right.</li>
      <li>IT WOULD WORK GREAT ON A DRYER WITH A SMALL TIP.</li>
      <li>This concentrator melted the first time she used it because she used heat.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off spending the extra cash and buying the dryer specific nozzle to assure the correct fit.</li>
      <li>at first i thought it didnt fit.i was getting ready to return</li>
      <li>The product is cheap, so I buy them regularly and use them as disposable items.</li>
      <li>so now I have a nozzle that would cost twice as much to return as the product itself....  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The inside of the nozzle is adjustable so it looks like it&#x27;d fit onto a variety of different sized dryers.</li>
      <li>I know this was a universal, but not all universals actually fit.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know how they can claim it to be universal fit????  </li>
      <li>While it fit my hair dryer, it lasted only a week.  </li>
      <li>I was hopeful about this product being a universal fit for conair hair dryers, and I personally was not disappointed to that respect.  </li>
      <li>You can only use it on the cool air setting for the hair dryer.</li>
      <li>There is a sticker on it that says do not use with high heat.  </li>
      <li>The label inside say it can not be used with high heat.</li>
      <li>I was disheartened when I read the sticker on the side that warns the user against using this tool with high heat.  </li>
      <li>It fits snugly, although it did take a couple of tries to make it fit.</li>
      <li>Well, if they are universal, AT LEAST they have to fit most of the Con Air dryers.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a touch large, which can make it a bit unwieldy, but then, I&#x27;m hardly the most graceful hair stylist, so perhaps that&#x27;s just</li>
      <li>Just gonna invest in a new blow dryer at this point.</li>
      <li>I understand it won&#x27;t fit all hair dryers, but you&#x27;ll need to have a pretty narrow nozzle to start with to get this narrow concentrator to fit on it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this three stars instead of two because this particular concentrator design manages to really force the air into a very tight and even stream, which makes it particularly useful!</li>
      <li>many people reviewed that this was too small...</li>
      <li>The only positive that came from this is that I was not injured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was so excited to buy a concentrator nozzle for my dryer (Conair 1875, it&#x27;s pink and black) and this UNIVERSAL nozzle DOESN&#x27;T FIT.</li>
      <li>fits well and so far it has worked for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what dryers it would fit.</li>
      <li>Was trying to avoid spending money on a new blow dryer and decided to just buy a concentration nozzle for my current one.</li>
      <li>This will only fit dryers with narrow nozzles.</li>
      <li>AT LEAST it should fit on Conair dryers.</li>
      <li>This is the only universal nozzle I have found that truly fits; however, the product really DOES NOT last.  </li>
      <li>Due to the heat, it became very warped and it separated into (2) peices.  </li>
      <li>Considering what I paid in the first place, returning it would have been a waste of time and money.</li>
      <li>A bit large and heavy, but does the job.</li>
      <li>The price was decent but not worth paying to ship it back.</li>

<li> would never recommend this product to anyone for any purpose other than a door stop.</li>
<li> Not worth the price of return shipping</li>

<li> The base was a loose fit, but I thought it might work.</li>
<li> I get less than a month out of each one.</li>
<li> can try, but no guarantee this product is going to fit your dryer : (</li>
<li> Does not fit my Connie hair dryer</li>
<li> However, it does not fit on the Infiniti 223xrb (the magenta one).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> RATHER THAN DESCRIBING THE ATTACHMENT AS FITTING MOST HAIR DRYERS THEY SHOULD GIVE THE MAXIMUM WIDTH THE NOZZLE FITS. IT WOULD WORK GREAT ON A DRYER WITH A SMALL TIP. I NEED IT FOR A TRAVEL HAIR DRYER WHICH HAS A 2 INCH TIP SO IT WAS TOO SMALL. PRICE IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> The product was in good shape, arrived quickly, and is durable. It fit on my blow dryer just fine.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the item did not fit my dryer, but I guess it was my mistake, as I had a different model not the pro one, but I should say the concentrator look in very good condition and quality, then I forced it into my dryer and I was able to  barely fit it in but ended up braking it. That was the end of it.  I could not find one online for my model.</li>
    <li> Did not fit.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Considering it&#x27;s a Conair attachment, I assumed it would fit my Conair dryer, which it does not.  I understand it won&#x27;t fit all hair dryers, but you&#x27;ll need to have a pretty narrow nozzle to start with to get this narrow concentrator to fit on it.</li>
    <li> I have the Conair Infiniti {http://www.amazon.com/Infiniti-Conair-Motor-Styling-Orange/dp/B003521CA2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_8?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1331563107&amp;sr&#x3D;8-8} and this fits perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inside of the nozzle is adjustable so it looks like it&#x27;d fit onto a variety of different sized dryers. Easy to just snap on and stays put. Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Does not fit my Connie hair dryer</li>
    <li> Since the product description said this fit almost all hair dryers and my hair dryer is made by Conair (I have an ion shine 1875), I assumed it would fit. It did not. This will only fit dryers with narrow nozzles. Lame.</li>
    <li> Was trying to avoid spending money on a new blow dryer and decided to just buy a concentration nozzle for my current one. This didn&#x27;t fit my Revlon dryer, which isn&#x27;t large by any means. It really was so small I&#x27;m not sure what dryers it would fit.</li>
    <li> After the heat concentrator that came with my Conair Pro Yellow Bird hair dryer broke, I bought this as a replacement.  While it fit my hair dryer, it lasted only a week.  Due to the heat, it became very warped and it separated into (2) peices.  My hairdryer doesn&#x27;t even blow that hot! I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for a replacement.</li>
    <li> After I bought it, I realize you can&#x27;t use it. The label inside say it can not be used with high heat. Hello! I need the heat to tame my clients hairs and give them the style I want. It&#x27;s lame.</li>
    <li> I know this was a universal, but not all universals actually fit. This fit my old Conair blow dryer perfectly and easily.</li>
    <li> While it fits onto my hair dryer, it doesn&#x27;t stay.  Within a few seconds it launches itself and pops off the hair dryer.  It is not usable.</li>
    <li> i have conair shine 1875 blow dryer..at first i thought it didnt fit.i was getting ready to return but i decided to look inside nozzle and pressed the insides to loosen. then i pushed it on dryer hard and it fit perfect and stays on too.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to buy a concentrator nozzle for my dryer (Conair 1875, it&#x27;s pink and black) and this UNIVERSAL nozzle DOESN&#x27;T FIT. Now I&#x27;m going to have to take a trip back to the store and return the stupid thing. WHY DOES A UNIVERSAL CONAIR PRODUCT NOT FIT ALL CONAIR DRYERS?! SO ANGRY. WASTE OF A TRIP</li>
    <li> This fit my hairdryer perfectly.  At first it worked fine.  However after less than a month of daily use, the nozzle keeps coming off the attachment and won&#x27;t stay on.  The part where it connects to the hair dryer fits great so it&#x27;s not an issue of fit but poor quality.  There is a sticker on it that says do not use with high heat.  Isn&#x27;t that what a hairdryer does?</li>
    <li> I have a Conair Blackbird. The base was a loose fit, but I thought it might work. Not even two minutes into my blow dry, the nozzle separated from the plastic base and does not reconnect. Total junk!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how they can claim it to be universal fit????  Well, if they are universal, AT LEAST they have to fit most of the Con Air dryers.  I have 2 Con Air dryers at home and none of them can fit into this nozzle.  So mad!</li>
    <li> A bit large and heavy, but does the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a replacement for a conair dryer. It is said it would work with most dryers.  Nope. Not mine! It flew right off.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all right. It gets the job done, but I practically have to wrestle this thing onto the end of my Revlon blowdryer. Once it&#x27;s on, however, it stays put and doesn&#x27;t leak air. It&#x27;s a touch large, which can make it a bit unwieldy, but then, I&#x27;m hardly the most graceful hair stylist, so perhaps that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this three stars instead of two because this particular concentrator design manages to really force the air into a very tight and even stream, which makes it particularly useful!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money... there has to be a better concentrator out there!!</li>
    <li> The concept is great but, unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t stay on either of my hair dryers.  You&#x27;re better off spending the extra cash and buying the dryer specific nozzle to assure the correct fit.</li>
    <li> I read reviews and it looked like it would fit my dryer.  It doesn&#x27;t, so now I have a nozzle that would cost twice as much to return as the product itself....  lesson learned.  I&#x27;m sure it works great for very small dryers...  just not mine</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the Revlon 1875 Ionic dryer. It&#x27;s big, bulky and heavy for something that should weigh next to nothing.</li>
    <li> Got mine from Sally&#x27;s. Didn&#x27;t fit my Conair model 1875 hair dryer. Really cheaply made and I will be returning it. &amp;#34;universal fit&amp;#34; is a lie.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this because it said it only fits hairdryers with nozzles that are 8mm wide.  I checked and this is only 1/3 of an inch wide.  How can that be???</li>
    <li> Did not fit my hairdryer as described.</li>
    <li> many people reviewed that this was too small... it can be separated and used for different size hair dryers.  The top nozzle piece fits perfectly on the normal size Conair dryer.  I have owned the product for about 3months (6/2015).</li>
    <li> Did not fit my Conair Pro Elite. Good thing it was so cheap. I read the reviews and thought it would fit but, no.&lt;br /&gt;Weird.</li>
    <li> This thing did not fit my dryer. I have a standard size Conair hair dryer that I bought in Duane Reade, I figured this thing would fit and it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s way too small. It appears to have some sort or attachment that allows it to connect to small hair dryers, but even after removing that attachment, it still would not fit on my dryer. Considering what I paid in the first place, returning it would have been a waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and order something else, unless you have a blow dryer with a really small nozzle.</li>
    <li> This does not fit either of our dryers and one is even a conair! Not worth the price of return shipping so i guess i&#x27;m stuck with something i can never use.</li>
    <li> This pops off the end of my hairdryer when I use it, unless I position it on the hairdryer upside down (with the words &amp;#34;CONAIR PRO&amp;#34; on the bottom) and even then sometimes.  I still use it because it really does make a difference in how smooth my blowout is.  Makes me crazy when it pops off the dryer and bonks me in the head, though.</li>
    <li> This product was marketed as being a universal nozzle but it did not fit my blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I have 4 hair dryers.  This &amp;#34;Universal Fit&amp;#34; worked on none of them.</li>
    <li> Another reviewer said this attachment worked for their Conair Infiniti hairdryer (the orange model, I believe). However, it does not fit on the Infiniti 223xrb (the magenta one). Bummer.</li>
    <li> I have gone through four of these! I can maybe use them about ten times before the heat melts the attachment and it falls apart! Just gonna invest in a new blow dryer at this point.</li>
    <li> do not fit with my conair hair dryer, terrible!</li>
    <li> How does Conair make a universal nozzle that doesn&#x27;t even fit their own product?&lt;br /&gt;I was flabbergasted.  I got an idea Conair, sell your concentrator nozzle for each of the products you build and sell?  I&#x27;ll take two.&lt;br /&gt;You can try, but no guarantee this product is going to fit your dryer : (</li>
    <li> the product is fully functional, fits perfectly. the Good Holiday, especially for conair dryers. fits well and so far it has worked for me.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for the nozzle that I somehow misplaced. It fits snugly, although it did take a couple of tries to make it fit. I&#x27;m very happy that I bought it.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful about this product being a universal fit for conair hair dryers, and I personally was not disappointed to that respect.  I was disheartened when I read the sticker on the side that warns the user against using this tool with high heat.  Well, I decided to try it anyway because that was the sole purpose of my purchase: to use this concentrator nozzle to help me heat style my hair using a hair dryer.  Unfortunately, the product snapped into two pieces about five uses in.  Upon further inspection, the base that connects to the nozzle actually had warped from melting.  The only positive that came from this is that I was not injured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend this product to anyone for any purpose other than a door stop.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my hairdryer I had.</li>
    <li> The nozzle is not attached to the bottom ring that fits on the hair dryer.  Therefore it falls off when you are trying to dry your hair.  It also gets very hot even on a lower setting.  You can use the bottom ring alone, but it also allows your hair to blow around and get frizzy.  Very frustrating item!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this made in China hunk of plastic!</li>
    <li> Great idea because the concentrator that comes with hair dryers seems to expand with the heat and over time doesn&#x27;t stay on. But this is not the solution. It literally shot off the end of my hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it zero stars but that didn&#x27;t seem to be an option .  Conair you can do better!</li>
    <li> This is a piece of CRAP. Fit one out of four blow dryers I tried to fit it on, and the one it fit on overheated and burnt out because of this nozzle. Also can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
    <li> The description read like it would fit most, if not all, Conair Pro hair dryers.  Once it is placed on the end of the hair dryer it springs off.  There isn&#x27;t anything on the inside of the nozzle to click on to hair dryer or hold it in place.  The price was decent but not worth paying to ship it back.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a beauty store and man does it SUCK! It falls off very easily and it also has a sticker that says \\&quot;Do not use with heat...\\&quot; WTH? I tired it once on the lowest heat setting and the darn thing melted and also messed up my chi blow dryer! NEVER buy this thing! Luckily the store let me return it and considered it a damaged item.  Not worth a single penny!</li>
    <li> doesnt secure to the hair dryer, it fits but there is nothign to lock it on so If it is hit with a brush or something like that, it falls off.</li>
    <li> This is the only universal nozzle I have found that truly fits; however, the product really DOES NOT last.  Tiny plastic clips hold the nozzle onto the base and they ALWAYS break. The product is cheap, so I buy them regularly and use them as disposable items. I get less than a month out of each one. It&#x27;s aggravating, though, and as soon as I find a better-quality product, I will move along. Got to wonder, has Conair even tested this product?</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit a conair hairdryer</li>
    <li> I bought this attachment for my wife. You can only use it on the cool air setting for the hair dryer. This concentrator melted the first time she used it because she used heat. Who drys their hair without heat?</li>
    <li> SooOo mad! It didn&#x27;t fit on my Conair 1875...AT LEAST it should fit on Conair dryers. This is NOT universal at all. Bad purchase and a lack of information on Amazon&#x27;s web page</li>
