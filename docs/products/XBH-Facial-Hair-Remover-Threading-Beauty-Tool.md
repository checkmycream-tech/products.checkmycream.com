### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>If it did it would be great.</li>
      <li>This took me a while to learn, but once I got the hang of it, it works great.</li>
      <li>It works surprisingly well.</li>
      <li>I liked it, works great</li>
      <li>Cheap and awesome.</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>Good for chin/upper lip, but</li>
      <li>Love my hair remover!  </li>
      <li>Amazingly it works just like advertised.  </li>
      <li>Honestly beauty is pain sometimes, we women wear heels that hurt our feet to no end in the name of beauty</li>
      <li>This works so good and is so cheap.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s more effective than waxing because it targets longer hair rather than ALL of the hair including the finer fuzz</li>
      <li>If the inverted-U shape isn&#x27;t working for you perhaps the horizontal way would work better for you.</li>
      <li>If it could somehow be tighter when it grabs a hair, it might be able to pull body hair.</li>
      <li>It does what it says it can do, just not my favorite form of hair removal</li>
      <li>Compared to that, this is a lot more efficient.</li>
      <li>You could try squeezing with your hands, but it could bend easily.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and works well, however it doesn&#x27;t get every hair (for me).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think you could use it on eyebrows unless you&#x27;re far more talented at accuracy with this thing than me.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>But it has had success</li>
      <li>I am doing it right because I looked it up on YouTube on how to use it.</li>
      <li>Pay the extra money and get a better quality remover.</li>
      <li>First time trying a product like this.</li>
      <li>It takes some practice to get the right twisting down, but it makes hair removal quick and (mostly) painless.</li>
      <li>so what&#x27;s a little sting if it can guarantee you a fuzz free face :-)</li>
      <li>but I kind of expected that!</li>
      <li>Just focus on practicing how to move the pieces, and distracting yourself from what is really just many tweezers grabbing onto whatever they possibly can.  </li>
      <li>It certainly will pull the hair, however it comes with no instructions, and it&#x27;s not foolproof.</li>
      <li>Works very well..</li>
      <li>It does not work very well.</li>
      <li>Though Painless might be a stretch, it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as plucking or waxing.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t bother me much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What worked for me is to hold the tool horizontally and instead of holding the pink handles I held the coil part for more control.</li>
      <li>Kind of hard to use at first until you ge tthe hang of it.</li>
      <li>I love this little guy.</li>
      <li>This tool also helps me in saving  my few dollars :)</li>
      <li>Make sure you start out slow, and don&#x27;t try to do everything the first couple times.  </li>
      <li>Time to get a new one</li>
      <li>For the redness I just used a little A&amp;D Ointment and it soothed it just fine without clogging my pores or giving me and bumps.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this little gadget !!</li>
      <li>As far as pain, It plucks the hairs out-</li>
      <li>Item is exactly as described &amp; expected.</li>
      <li>Love this little thing!!!</li>
      <li>I have those light hairs that are hard to pluck, and this gets them.</li>
      <li>Yes it does sting a little bit at first</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll usually do it when I&#x27;m watching a movie or something, and the more I practice the less</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;m using it right.</li>

<li> cuz I use it so often, it has stretched.</li>
<li> Yeah, it hurts, but so does half the stuff women do on the daily anyways.  </li>
<li> this little gadget has helped me out immensely ...</li>
<li> It really does remove thin hairs on your face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if maybe my technique is imperfect, but I don&#x27;t always grab the hair on the 1st, 2nd, or even through the 5th try.</li>
<li> i read that people find it painful but for those who are use to threading ..will find it painless and also  easy to use.</li>
<li> I have suffered from the symptoms of PCOS for years and it can become very embarrassing and tiresome plucking and waxing and shaving ...</li>
<li> All you have to do is bend the spring into a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape and twist the handles in your fingers while moving up &amp; down along the area where you&#x27;d like to remove hair.</li>
<li> I use it for my upper lip and it doesn&#x27;t really hurt that bad at all.</li>
<li> Tweezers are a lot easier, but I may not have the hang of this little device.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> it is pretty painful</li>
<li> Takes a few minutes to figure it out!</li>
<li> It is too small and doesn&#x27;t pull out the hairs.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just not very good, at least for me.</li>
<li> but once you get use to it you hardly notice it.</li>
<li> Even when I pass it over the hair at least 5 times, still nothing.</li>
<li> If you are used to plucking/ threading your facial hair, it won&#x27;t be as painful.</li>
<li> so it depends upon how tough one is in that regard.</li>
<li> A lot of people are saying it&#x27;s difficult to get the hang of (which it is), but once you do, it&#x27;s effortless.</li>
<li> VERY difficult to use.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s painful, but no more-so than threading or waxing.</li>
<li> I did not like these because they are painful and did not remove all of my chin hairs.</li>
<li> Works well but very painful</li>
<li> Awful.  </li>

    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. It is too small and doesn&#x27;t pull out the hairs.</li>
    <li> First time trying a product like this. It is easy to use and works well, however it doesn&#x27;t get every hair (for me). I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pulls hair out, even though it may bring you to your knees in the process!  Good for chin/upper lip, but I don&#x27;t think you could use it on eyebrows unless you&#x27;re far more talented at accuracy with this thing than me. I have those light hairs that are hard to pluck, and this gets them.</li>
    <li> Love this little thing!!! It works great it is pretty painful but I kind of expected that!</li>
    <li> Works well but very painful</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even work like it was supposed to. Even when I pass it over the hair at least 5 times, still nothing. I am doing it right because I looked it up on YouTube on how to use it. It&#x27;s only pulling my skin. Prefer to just use my tweezers.</li>
    <li> VERY difficult to use.  I took a chance so I&#x27;m not returning it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this little gadget !!

    <li> Works very well.. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I did not like these because they are painful and did not remove all of my chin hairs.</li>
    <li> This works so good and is so cheap. A lot of people are saying it&#x27;s difficult to get the hang of (which it is), but once you do, it&#x27;s effortless. You just have to roll and twist it in the opposite direction of hair growth (like curling hair). I use it for my upper lip and it doesn&#x27;t really hurt that bad at all.</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as described &amp; expected. No instructions were included but I found plenty of videos online to help- All you have to do is bend the spring into a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape and twist the handles in your fingers while moving up &amp; down along the area where you&#x27;d like to remove hair. As far as pain, It plucks the hairs out- often several at a time- so it depends upon how tough one is in that regard. It really doesn&#x27;t bother me much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just arrived yesterday so I cannot attest to it&#x27;s longevity as of yet, if there is a problem I will update this review.</li>
    <li> It works just like how you go to the threading shop instead you do it in home. Now I can save my time from going to the brow/threading shop. If you are used to plucking/ threading your facial hair, it won&#x27;t be as painful. I use it often for my upper lip after a shower. Using it for the brow is maybe tougher but it works well for me on my upper lip.</li>
    <li> I liked it, works great just hurts a lil but the same as threading or anything else.</li>
    <li> Yeah, it hurts, but so does half the stuff women do on the daily anyways.  If you&#x27;re determined, you will get accustomed to the pain this can cause.  Make sure you start out slow, and don&#x27;t try to do everything the first couple times.  Just focus on practicing how to move the pieces, and distracting yourself from what is really just many tweezers grabbing onto whatever they possibly can.  I&#x27;ll usually do it when I&#x27;m watching a movie or something, and the more I practice the less it bothers me, just like when I learned to pluck out eyebrows.  Compared to that, this is a lot more efficient.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it can do, just not my favorite form of hair removal</li>
    <li> Awful.  Pay the extra money and get a better quality remover. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This took me a while to learn, but once I got the hang of it, it works great. FYI, I only use it on my chin area.  Eyebrows I am still leaving it to the expert. My skill is not quite there yet.</li>
    <li> I got it and it pulled some hairs but I&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;m using it right. It didn&#x27;t come with instructions just the product</li>
    <li> Tweezers are a lot easier, but I may not have the hang of this little device.</li>
    <li> this item was rusted at two areas when i received it.  the handles were also inferior.  definitely dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Good but it doesnt remove all of my upper lip hair</li>
    <li> Cheap and awesome. It really does remove thin hairs on your face. It gives no irritation to the skin. If it could somehow be tighter when it grabs a hair, it might be able to pull body hair. You could try squeezing with your hands, but it could bend easily.</li>
    <li> a must have tool...i read that people find it painful but for those who are use to threading ..will find it painless and also  easy to use. This tool also helps me in saving  my few dollars :)</li>
    <li> Amazingly it works just like advertised.  Though Painless might be a stretch, it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as plucking or waxing.</li>
    <li> It works surprisingly well. But boy does my girlfriend squeal when she uses it. It literally pulls the hairs out by the roots.</li>
    <li> Takes a few minutes to figure it out! It certainly will pull the hair, however it comes with no instructions, and it&#x27;s not foolproof. It&#x27;s painful, but no more-so than threading or waxing. I think it&#x27;s more effective than waxing because it targets longer hair rather than ALL of the hair including the finer fuzz your powder makeup sticks too. I&#x27;m not sure if maybe my technique is imperfect, but I don&#x27;t always grab the hair on the 1st, 2nd, or even through the 5th try. But it has had success so I will continue using it!</li>
    <li> I initially made the coil into a inverted-U shape since that&#x27;s how I saw it was being used in photos of similar products. It wasn&#x27;t working out for me, so I played around with a bit. What worked for me is to hold the tool horizontally and instead of holding the pink handles I held the coil part for more control. I then rolled it upwards on the areas I wanted to remove facial hair. If the inverted-U shape isn&#x27;t working for you perhaps the horizontal way would work better for you.</li>
    <li> It does not work very well. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This hurts a lot! Which isn&#x27;t a problem, it just doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs. If it did it would be great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get this to work. I&#x27;m following all of the instructions. It&#x27;s just not very good, at least for me.</li>
