<li> My hair is pretty thick and the barrette needs to be another inch or two longer.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for this in black.</li>
<li> much less interlocking.</li>
<li> Not sure how it would work in other types of hair.</li>
<li> Too heavy and doesn&#x27;t stay in hair well.</li>
<li> They are not overly heavy, and don&#x27;t fall out of my hair.  </li>
<li> bad, because it IS pretty.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s next to useless.</li>
<li> My hair is fairly thick.</li>
<li> I have very thick hair</li>
<li> Try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>

    <li> Accurate black color pictured.  I have several of these barrettes in different styles &amp; colors and would purchase more.  They are not overly heavy, and don&#x27;t fall out of my hair.  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and dressy.  I get all my barrettes from Amazon.  Never disappointed.</li>

    <li> Pretty hair clip. Works just fine.</li>
    <li> I love this barrette.  It&#x27;s dressy or you can wear it to dress down with sporty clothes also.  Have purchased the red one as well. I am a GIANT New Orleans Saints fan and the Black/Gold team colors are awesome.</li>
    <li> These barrettes are so beautiful! So many compliments! It feels comfortable too. I bought 4 different color&#x27;s They hold up well.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> So...french barrettes... you know how they have the two opposing metal brackets that interlock with each other to squeeze your hair and keep the thing from falling out? Well, those brackets on this particular barrette don&#x27;t even come close to touching, much less interlocking. Unless you&#x27;re clipping a ton of hair into it -- assuming you have a ton of hair to work with, it&#x27;s not going to stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, because it IS pretty. But it&#x27;s next to useless.</li>
    <li> Too heavy and doesn&#x27;t stay in hair well. My hair is fairly thick. Not sure how it would work in other types of hair. Beautiful accent for your hair though.</li>
    <li> Love it again great for my fine hair</li>
    <li> Beautiful! It is not large enough to hold all of one&#x27;s hair if that is what you are looking for as a buyer. It does make a wonderful compliment to a pony tail or updo though and it thus far appears as if it might last for a while. I have ordered others that broke the first time I tried to wear it.</li>
    <li> Well built barette that looks like I paid a lot more than I did (and it holds up better than some that I paid $11 each for). These really are well made, metal hair clips</li>
    <li> everything I wear I need my clothes and accessories to be color coordinated LOL  so I will continue looking for more  very thankful for Amazon</li>
    <li> cheaper looking than photos</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very beautiful and versatile piece of jewelry that can be used for everyday wear as well as for the situations requiring a bit more of dress-up.  It perfectly holds a moderately sized ponytail and is bright and sparkly without gaudiness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for this in black. It&#x27;s great for thick, long hair. I can wear it 1/2 up without a band.</li>
    <li> Shines nicely. Good size barrette to pull hair back at the nape.</li>
    <li> Item is as described. Love it. Very nice. Great customer service. 5*****</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty hair clip, but smaller than I thought it would be. I was more hoping for something bigger, for when I put my hair up. Guess I&#x27;ll just use it when I put my hair half-up and half-down. Great strong clip, though!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my MIL for Christmas, (from her Wish List), and it was quite beautiful, and well received. So glad she loved it!</li>
    <li> I love this. I have gotten so many compliments! It&#x27;s very durable, and holds even my fine hair well. Great product.</li>
    <li> I was impressed by the quality and look of the barrette but I was hoping to be able to do a pony tail with it.  My hair is pretty thick and the barrette needs to be another inch or two longer.  I&#x27;ll keep it because I like it and will try to do something different with it,</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and looks so much more expensive than it was. It was also free shipping.</li>
    <li> Bought all three colors, very happy and great price!</li>
    <li> I have a bunch of these barrettes in different colors.  I have thick, long hair, and they fit and really hold well.  They&#x27;re very pretty, and a nice size.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments and people asking where to buy them.  Try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Very Very pretty and well made!</li>
    <li> It did take a while to arrive, but it looks great--exactly like the picture. Seems sturdy and I expect it to last a long time. I wish the dimensions of all hair clips were in the descriptions.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair, it slides down and comes off.  I&#x27;ve had other clips and they stay in place in my hair.</li>
    <li> This clip is beautiful. I have very thick hair and it is large enough to hold all of my hair in it. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> very nice and so cheap!  I think they&#x27;re making a great product&lt;br /&gt;and I recommend to anyone who wants attractive hair clips!</li>
