    <li> This product was bought for my girlfriend and she loved it. Quality was fair and the craftsmanship is not bad at all. Ultimately, the seller took the efforts to contact me via email to confirm whether or not my packaged was received. I guess it was the UPS&#x27; fault, but i receieved it on time and it said that it was not delivered and is currently in ups facility. Ultimately, very nice seller and decent products. Up to expectations.</li>
