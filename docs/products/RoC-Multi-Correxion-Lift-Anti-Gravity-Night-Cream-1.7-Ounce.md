      <li>I have more definition around my jawline which I love and</li>
      <li>Like I said, I am 33, and so many people think I am 22.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Used many, many creams.  </li>
      <li>, been using many types of face creams from ROC for over 20 years and people always think I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, but I am about to turn 50.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, but I use it as a day cream, not night.</li>
      <li>I took a glance in the mirror and realized that my skin appeared tighter, more contoured and,</li>
      <li>you satisfied if u use it</li>
      <li>I have used it before, love this product line.  </li>
      <li>Being able to schedule future shipments is wonderful too.</li>
      <li>I will surely recommend this product to friends and relatives.</li>
      <li>When my husband asks me \\&quot;okay, how&#x27;d you get rid of those jowls,\\</li>
      <li>Seems to work on firming up my ageing skin that has been exposed to the elements for more years than I would like to count.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used too many of these fancy creams and I&#x27;m glad I did..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Rock products for many years.</li>
      <li>The three stars is more for the vendor than the product.  </li>
      <li>but this was just okay.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>arrive in time and works pretty good.</li>
      <li>It goes on nicely but didn&#x27;t seem to absorb into my skin &amp; as best as I describe would &amp;#34;roll off&amp;#34; after a few minutes.</li>
      <li>If you have fine lines or just want a more youthful appearance</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very good for that only because it&#x27;s made by ROC,but no retinol.</li>
      <li>It is an excellent product; maybe the company will think of making body lotion or other products, like soap and shower gel.  </li>
      <li>I strongly recommend you consider whether you would like this to happen to you before trying this product.</li>
      <li>Keeps the skin young, helps the fight the signs of aging,  has a light texture and perfect, the skin absorbs very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I also use Roc Brilliance primer in the morning (it has no color), and have quit wearing foundation (just a light dusting of finishing powder).  </li>
      <li>I use the face moisturizer with color tent from garnier light and medium skin miracle skin perfecter with BB cream with spf and for the eyes</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, not greasy</li>
      <li>Jusr started it but so far so good.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve had very good results with other Roc products, I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Have tried many night eye creams, but Roc leaves my skin super smooth and I noticed results quickly.  </li>
      <li>After five months of use, I have noticed a more even complection, my daughter asked me the other day if I was wearing foundation because my skin tone looked so even and not blotchy, and I responded happily that I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I used to buy Meaningful Beauty and was looking for something that was as good , if not better, at a better price.</li>
      <li>If anyone has had better results with another product I would really like to know</li>
      <li>I wish I had known about this product earlier, saw a difference in my complexion just after using for a week, good price also</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon, I got a better price</li>
      <li>It is reducing brown spots quickly.</li>
      <li>Good moisturizing, but waiting to see any long term difference.</li>
      <li>I see much results with this cream and will continue to order it!!</li>
      <li>Love it so far!</li>
      <li>My skin feels tight and smooth, and it looks bright and lifted.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 4 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic changes yet, but my skin feel amazing.</li>
      <li>That surprised me the most.</li>
      <li>A good way to judge the effectiveness of a product is whether you repurchase and repurchase due to satisfactory results...and</li>
      <li>and I got it super fast with this cream.</li>
      <li>It shipped quickly and was reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>First time i&#x27;m using this</li>
      <li>but I really didn&#x27;t expect they would!</li>
      <li>I just purchased my first ever jar of RoC this evening and applied the cream about 20 minutes ago.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m about halfway through my first jar and, while it might be partly from stroking the product upward along the jaw line, I do believe it&#x27;s helping.</li>
      <li>The first 2 week I felt a lil bit burning and irritated every time I applied the cream.</li>
      <li>Will definitely get more.</li>
      <li>but I could not use it consistently</li>
      <li>I have now tried so many different retinol creams and none, not even the &amp;#34;2%&amp;#34; creams come close to the effectiveness of this roc product.</li>
      <li>This was the first product I saw that looked like it would help that problem specifically.  </li>
      <li>Can see the skin became so smooth and soft after couple weeks.  </li>
      <li>I use the neutrogena microdermabrasion system first for cleansing, then I use neutrogena cleansing wips, and before bed, I put this cream on.</li>
      <li>As it is, it is doing wonders for my 72 year old skin, particularly my laugh wrinkles and smile lines.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been impressed by all of RoC&#x27;s products, and this one did not disappoint. I recently tried all the Multi Correxion Lift products and have been amazed at the results! My skin feels tight and smooth, and it looks bright and lifted. I also use the eye product and the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am 48 years old, and I was starting to notice some deeper lines around my mouth and jawline.  I decided to try the Roc night cream as it was one of the recommended products in an anti-aging book I read.  I started to see improvement within 3 weeks of starting use of this product.  It is very reasonably priced and is as good, if not better than some much more expensive brands that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid forties, started really caring for my skin until recently so I started to use this product after trying out other RoC products and seeing results. After five months of use, I have noticed a more even complection, my daughter asked me the other day if I was wearing foundation because my skin tone looked so even and not blotchy, and I responded happily that I wasn&#x27;t. With retinol, or not, this product has made a huge difference on my skin tone and overall appearance.</li>
    <li> Not as hydrating as I expected. Im young and have dry skin so I typically go for anti-aging creams to get the extra moisture but this was just okay.</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels, not too heavy and not watery.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my wrinkles though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 4 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic changes yet, but my skin feel amazing. It soaks in nicely and makes the skin look and feel radiant. Love it so far!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing product even though it&#x27;s not for moisturizing.  Gets rid of the winter weathered dry skin on my face.</li>
    <li> If you have fine lines or just want a more youthful appearance I suggest you try this product.  This product did wut it said I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Rock is better than other face producta</li>
    <li> This product has a pine like smell in my opinion. If you are sensitive to fragrances like myself (migraine triggers), it may bother you. I gave it to my mother.</li>
    <li> Used many, many creams.  I like this one.  Not greasy, very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I tried it as per the instructions for two months with no resutls but hey, I&#x27;m old (66)  and I guess everyone is different, doesn&#x27;t mean  you shouldn&#x27;t give it a shot. If anyone has had better results with another product I would really like to know so I can try it.</li>
    <li> arrive in time and works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I received this product June 3, 2015, and could not find an expiration date, so I went online to check it.  I found that it had been manufactured on February 13, 2013.  The website I used to check it stated that most products with a shelf life of 30 moths or less need to be labeled with an expiration date.  Since there wasn&#x27;t one, I assume it must have a longer shelf life, but who wants to use a product that is already 2+ years old?  I am sure there is nothing wrong with it, but I don&#x27;t like the idea that this vendor (not Amazon) is selling old products.  The other RoC product I received listed Amazon as the vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2nd jar of RoC Multi Correxion Lift Anti-Gravity Night Cream I have bought,  andI do  like it.  Although the visible results have been minimal, my skin is much smoother and softer feeling when I use it.  The three stars is more for the vendor than the product.  I would give the product a 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, but I use it as a day cream, not night.</li>
    <li> I do not write I review after I&#x27;m sure,I have been using the Roc cream for almost 3 months, it really works pretty well,  give some time and you will see, please lets help each other write just when you are sure, thanks</li>
    <li> Jusr started it but so far so good. No noticeable effects yet but ROC never disappoints</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Works well with my sensitive skin.  It not too thick, blends well and has my skin soft in the mornings. I did notice when I accidently ran my fingers over my eyelid one night when I was in a hurry that it burned to no end.  I had to get a wet cloth and pat it off.  Don&#x27;t accidently get this on those eyelids LOL</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I saw amazing results in less than a week. Will definitely get more.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleasantly surprised at how well this cream works. It brightens my completion.  It is reducing brown spots quickly. That surprised me the most. I&#x27;ve tried probably a dozen creams trying to get this result and I got it super fast with this cream. The day cream version makes it work even faster even combined with this night cream.</li>
    <li> Roc products are the best.  I see much results with this cream and will continue to order it!!</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try a retinol cream since everybody seems to rave about it.  I have combination skin which gets angry for no apparent reason at times. What I&#x27;ve noticed: first few days I got some peeling on my cheeks, so I gave it a break and used my normal night cream for a couple of nights. After this initial drying effect, I can definitely see improved skin clarity. I wake up with perfectly clear skin, no blotches or irritations and no uneven dryness. I think there is an improvement in fine lines, but I don&#x27;t have many to start with, so it&#x27;s a bit hard to tell. The cream feels a bit &#x27;thin&#x27;, so I was skeptical initially, but it is actually very emollient to compensate for the effect of retinol. In the first few days, when the dryness occurred, I had to use a day cream as well. Now I just use my regular BB cream in the morning. I love this cream and will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Hoped it would be unscented like other ROC products but this had a strong smell I did not like - it might work but I could not use it consistently</li>
    <li> I have used it before, love this product line.  Can see the skin became so smooth and soft after couple weeks.  Also very good money value.</li>
    <li> Wrinkles are fading! Very nice cream not too heavy which I hate in the summer. I haven&#x27;t used too many of these fancy creams and I&#x27;m glad I did.. I was getting some sideways wrinkle under my eyes and using this bs some eye cream seem to be doing the trick!</li>
    <li> I have now tried so many different retinol creams and none, not even the &amp;#34;2%&amp;#34; creams come close to the effectiveness of this roc product. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of their other products, but this one works really well.</li>
    <li> This product is what I expected. It shipped quickly and was reasonably priced. I will order it again and again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for less than $20 and it works. The first 2 week I felt a lil bit burning and irritated every time I applied the cream. Since I already bought it so I kept using it every night patiently. And I noticed a different from week 4. My face look a bit tighten, brighter. This review has given at week 5 and i&#x27;m still amazed at this product as time goes by.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Rock products for many years. I&#x27;m 62 but am told I look 32! Try this luxurious night cream.</li>
    <li> Seems to work on firming up my ageing skin that has been exposed to the elements for more years than I would like to count.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my first ever jar of RoC this evening and applied the cream about 20 minutes ago. I took a glance in the mirror and realized that my skin appeared tighter, more contoured and, well…lifted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 36 with combination skin, and have been using DDF Firming Cream for 2 years to really no avail. I suppose a formula that works for one may not work for another; we all have different skin. I never got immediate results from DDF so I am totally blown away by RoC so far. My main concerns are slight, minute lines around my eyes, a crazy frown line on the bridge of my nose, moderate smile lines and my absolute favorite–the early stages of the dreaded &amp;#34;turkey neck.&amp;#34; I know if I don&#x27;t do something now, in ten years I will look a hundred times worse. I will update this review as the months go along; I know these creams take time! So far however, the immediate lift claim on the jar is true, at least for me.</li>
    <li> First time i&#x27;m using this and I love it.</li>
    <li> This item arrived in an open box - not sealed, no cellophane.  I&#x27;m not comfortable buying an  item I place on my face every day that comes in an open box.  I returned this item.</li>
    <li> I can say this without hesitation that every product ROC has ever made that I have tried (and there are many) is wonderful.  I have extremely dry skin, so if I put it on at night and then wipe off excess in day and mix a little with my makeup I look fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, been using many types of face creams from ROC for over 20 years and people always think I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, but I am about to turn 50.  My new boss calls me KIDDO because he thinks I&#x27;m a lot younger then the rest of them in the office and one of the men there is only in his early 30&#x27;s...  ROC Rules!</li>
    <li> I think RoC Night Cream is making my face and neck smoother than it was. I am not expecting a miracle,just slowing down the aging process! I use face sunscreen during the day and have experienced no side effects from the Night Cream.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about a year, only on my neck, and saw and felt improvement in the  tightness of the skin.  I couldn&#x27;t find it when I shopped in a &amp;#34;we sell everything&amp;#34; store, so I bought another similarly advertised product, but soon gave the rest of that to someone that wanted to try it.  I then shopped Amazon and found the product cheaper than I could buy it at the drug store, so tried it again.  I saw improvement again within the first 3 weeks, and about a week ago, started using it not only on my neck, but my face as well.  It is too soon to see results there yet, but I expect some tightness in the skin there as well, hopefully soon.  I won&#x27;t try anything else from now on, because I like the results from this product.  I am 57 years old, and wish I would have used this product when I was much younger!</li>
    <li> This is the best I have ever used, just my luck that they are going to discontinue it</li>
    <li> Keeps the skin young, helps the fight the signs of aging,  has a light texture and perfect, the skin absorbs very well.&lt;br /&gt;I think that is a product indispensable for all  woman that to  want to keep their youth!!!</li>
    <li> Have not used it long enough to give a reliable review.  Though I&#x27;m a fan of ROC products, I probably won&#x27;t buy this again, and will buy a product with less additives.</li>
    <li> I am 33 years old. I use this for my jaw line and neck. After 1 week I saw a difference in my jaw line and the softness to my face. I use the neutrogena microdermabrasion system first for cleansing, then I use neutrogena cleansing wips, and before bed, I put this cream on. In the morning, amazing results. The texture of my skin has renewed dramatically! I don&#x27;t need make up! I use the face moisturizer with color tent from garnier light and medium skin miracle skin perfecter with BB cream with spf and for the eyes I use the anti dark circle renew, a little eye liner and volume mascara (only the volume, not the black mascara, because it shows too much) It looks like I have make up on but I don&#x27;t  (for the miracle skin perfecter) because it takes care of any discoloration to the skin (if any) when you wake up in the morning. I use it because when I wash my face in the morning, it gets a little red, so I use this as a moisture cover up. I feel these are great tips for anyone looking for youthful skin. Like I said, I am 33, and so many people think I am 22. It&#x27;s amazing, has amazing results. I am thinking of looking into other products from this brand. I hope my review helped. ( I did not purchase this on amazon, I am a frequent shopper on here though, but I do use this product and it&#x27;s great!)</li>
    <li> Love this cream and love your price! Being able to schedule future shipments is wonderful too.</li>
    <li> In the working world, perception of old-age still makes a difference, and for that reason I feel it necessary to delay the inevitable clues to my age. I&#x27;m still employed (in a high-energy, think fast profession) when many women my age are retiring, and I&#x27;m starting to show my age with a bit of sag along the jaw line.  This was the first product I saw that looked like it would help that problem specifically.  Since I&#x27;ve had very good results with other Roc products, I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about halfway through my first jar and, while it might be partly from stroking the product upward along the jaw line, I do believe it&#x27;s helping. It&#x27;s not an instant fix that artificially draws the skin tighter (tried another product for eye bags that does that, and the results were disastrous), but after about two weeks I started seeing a difference.  When my husband asks me \\&quot;okay, how&#x27;d you get rid of those jowls,\\&quot; I&#x27;ll know Roc did the trick again. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the full effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly young but wanted to start a regimen to keep my skin looking young for when I&#x27;m older. I really like this night cream because it&#x27;s not harsh at all, and has only softened my skin and made it look like I have a \\&quot;glow.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been using it on sun damage on my chest, and I have noticed the texture of my skin change in about a month. I will keep using this stuff!</li>
    <li> Good cream but don&#x27;t be fooled,there is no retinol in this cream,that was the reason i bought it,for the retinol.I was very upset.The product information said Retinol-False info.All it&#x27;s good for is moistering your face and it&#x27;s very good for that only because it&#x27;s made by ROC,but no retinol.I had to buy another product with retinol in it,so you could say it cost me double the money.Cream is good but i specifically bought it cause it said Retinol.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all and this works better that all the others.  All of the other Roc products work equally as well</li>
    <li> Using this cream has made my skin brighter, tighter and smoother.  I also use Roc Brilliance primer in the morning (it has no color), and have quit wearing foundation (just a light dusting of finishing powder).  I&#x27;m 55, still have rather oily skin, and my face has never looked this good.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my wife.  she seems very happy with it,even though i dont notice the difference, but, as long as she is happy so am i.</li>
    <li> I love the smoothness of this cream. I&#x27;ve only been using for a few months but it really does the job of moisturizing. My skin feels softer and hydrated. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I KNOW THE PRODUCT IS HELPING BECAUSE I WAS USING AN EXPENSIVE DEPARTMENT STORE CREAM AND CHANGED TO THIS ONE AND IT IS WORKING JUST AS WELL AND I HAVE SAVED A LOT OF MONEY</li>
    <li> I just turned 36 years old, and bought this product in an effort to discover new products for &#x27;aging&#x27; skin. What I discovered was that this product, as well as the ROC eye cream with AHA left chemical burns all over my face, eyes, and neck. I now have hideous red and brown puffy marks over 80% of my face. I strongly recommend you consider whether you would like this to happen to you before trying this product.I have beautiful skin, and have never experienced sensitivity to any skin care product before using ROC.</li>
    <li> I only use night cream 24/7. My face is very dry 1/2 through the day with this product, I re-apply several times.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Need to order more !</li>
    <li> I never really wore foundation, just powder and blush, until I hit my 40&#x27;s. I&#x27;m now 42, and this is the age of yucky, blotchy skin. I&#x27;ve used the multi correction lift eye cream for about 2 years and I love it. I don&#x27;t even use makeup under my eyes. It looks better without it, because of this product. Anyway, I was putting my eye cream on and slipped and got some on my cheek. I notice immediately that the area was lighter than the rest of my cheek. So I tried a spot on my other cheek, and the same thing happened. I went to the store that day and bought the entire LIFT line and they all have this effect of brightening my skin instantly. The blotchiness is gone!  The tightening effect DOES immediately tighten and it shrinks the blood vessels, smoothing your complexion. I saw someone mention that it made their skin look 25.... It does!  I use the entire line on my face, neck and chest. It works!</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly and feels good on my face.  My wrinkles are not going away though but I really didn&#x27;t expect they would!</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m a big fan of RoC products, I didn&#x27;t care this one. It goes on nicely but didn&#x27;t seem to absorb into my skin &amp; as best as I describe would &amp;#34;roll off&amp;#34; after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good enough to use with good price to use and have excellent result .make you satisfied if u use it</li>
    <li> RoC products are great and I&#x27;ve used their facial lotions and creams for years. I look at least 10 years younger than my age and it&#x27;s in part due to my diligent skin care and RoC quality products. And the price on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat - I always waited for the chain drugstores to have sales on RoC - buy one get the 2nd 50% off was the usual deal - so I always had to buy more than I needed to get a good price, and then store them in my bathroom, where I&#x27;m already challenged for space.  Thanks to Amazon, I got a better price then the sale prices at my local drugstores, and I only have to buy what I need. I signed up for subscribe and save so I got an even better price.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Good product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful,  this is my new favorite face cream</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  It feels thick and rich but not heavy and oily, my face feels very moisturized with use.</li>
    <li> My skin was better the next day, will definitely purchase again! I can&#x27;t wait. Pleasant smell, no greasiness or stickiness. Best product for the price. Minimized pores, brightened skin.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of this product for about five years.  It lifted and firm the skin of my face and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.  It also helped the skin on my throat, all around my neck and below.  I wish there is a big container of this product that I can use all over my body.  It is an excellent product; maybe the company will think of making body lotion or other products, like soap and shower gel.  I will surely recommend this product to friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> I wish I had known about this product earlier, saw a difference in my complexion just after using for a week, good price also</li>
    <li> Jury is still out on this one. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and do not really see a difference yet. Good moisturizing, but waiting to see any long term difference. This cream does have a heavy perfume scent.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after having a sample of the product.  Have tried many night eye creams, but Roc leaves my skin super smooth and I noticed results quickly.  Goes on smooth, not greasy, no smell.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing . . . if I had known of it 20 years ago I&#x27;d look even better!  As it is, it is doing wonders for my 72 year old skin, particularly my laugh wrinkles and smile lines.  AND, I supplement this with an old facial exercise preventing down turned lips . . . clasp a pencil across your mouth between your lips.  Truly works additional wonders . . . about 15 minutes or so a day.</li>
    <li> A good way to judge the effectiveness of a product is whether you repurchase and repurchase due to satisfactory results...and I HAVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subtle changes occur regularly with continued improvement over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is especially useful for the jaw area that sometimes can become a little \\&quot;loose.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months and I really like the results. I use it during the day and it moisturizes without being overly greasy.</li>
    <li> I think there are a lot of &amp;#34;additives&amp;#34; in this product, tried to look it up on the beauty products site and they didn&#x27;t have it listed but there are a lot of ingredients which makes me nervous</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s  and was looking for a product that moisturized but tightened and firmed. I am very happy with this product. I have more definition around my jawline which I love and the cream is very silky with out being too greasy. I used to buy Meaningful Beauty and was looking for something that was as good , if not better, at a better price. I  just started my 2nd jar and plan to keep using.</li>
    <li> Excellent, I don&#x27;t expect to look 30 again but after 2 months people do seem to notice a change; feels good, isn&#x27;t greasy and gentle scent -</li>
