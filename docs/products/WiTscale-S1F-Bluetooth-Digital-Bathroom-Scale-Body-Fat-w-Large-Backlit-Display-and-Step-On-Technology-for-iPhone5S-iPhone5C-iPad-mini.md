      <li>I love the fact that this scale syncs via bluetooth and it worked perfectly with my iPhone 4s.  </li>
      <li>It is good that we don&#x27;t need to deal with any setup because the app will ask me to turn on Bluetooth and accept to connect.  </li>
      <li>It was good while it worked but out of nowhere it started changing between units by itself.</li>
      <li>I do not recommend this scale and feel that they do not have a good quality control of their production as some people have reported no issues.</li>
      <li>so perfect fit.  </li>
      <li>was very easy to setup and works great.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It seems it has a mind of its own.</li>
      <li>just the thought of having an accurate scale that would keep up with those numbers was very appealing.  </li>
      <li>Not too satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this product and I have been pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I love how it measures</li>
      <li>Love that can sync with iPhone and keep track of weight with app.</li>
      <li>Love this scale - works great, the bluetooth works very well.  </li>
      <li>I love it and looking to get another one as a gift for my mother.  </li>
      <li>I have the latest operating system and bluetooth works fine with my car, so no problems there.  </li>
      <li>Extremely easy to sync and use.</li>
      <li>Hands down, this is the best scale.</li>
      <li>And the scale seems not too accurate.</li>
      <li>It is so accurate and is so convenient.  </li>
      <li>When this one eventually dies, I&#x27;ll know that it&#x27;s worth the money to go ahead and get a better looking one.</li>
      <li>it is cute and my pounds are right but does not work well.</li>
      <li>gave it 2 stars because the weight seems to be consistent for the most part.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this scale.  </li>
      <li>So far I don&#x27;t have any issue except it will be nice to allowing me to record and share my weight measurement to myfitnesspal apps.</li>
      <li>Bluetooth syncs up quickly with my iPhone 6 Plus.</li>
      <li>The color is very pretty and it is made well.</li>
      <li>Also, great feature is can see weight on phone without having to look down at scale.</li>
      <li>It is just so fun to do that together.</li>
      <li>it synced right away with the IPhone 6</li>
      <li>My husband bought this amazing body fat scale from Amazon two weeks ago and we started sharing our weight/bmi/body fat data in a single mini-ipad.</li>
      <li>But I didn&#x27;t pay $80 for just a consistent scale.</li>
      <li>Make sure footing is centered and not near edge.</li>
      <li>As others have mentioned this scale is very inaccurate.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and pink (my favorite color) which is an added bonus for me.  </li>
      <li>And I love pink,</li>
      <li>and my feet cover the whole thing, and it says not to let your feet hang over the edges?</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t see the advanced features like body fat, water weight etc on the scale, only on the app.</li>
      <li>When I first bought this scale, I was completely bummed that it didn&#x27;t work with our iPhone 4 dinosaurs.  </li>
      <li>Also, I thought being pink was cute, but it really appears this scale may be designed for someone younger with child sized feet.</li>
      <li>All the reviews on here are positive and indicate no problems, so I thought I should warn potential buyers there</li>
      <li>However, the bodyfat measurement is FAR off for me, and I believe it&#x27;s because they use the weight to height calculation to obtain the body fat percentage.</li>
      <li>I place phone on counter near scale and watch that.  </li>
      <li>The cheap drugstore scale that I have registered the same weight or within a few tenths of a pound every time as I tried it to compare.</li>
      <li>I weighed 5 different times within a 10 minute period and each time got a different result that varied by as much as 5lbs.</li>
      <li>I am left either trying to do conversions or left to buy a new scale.</li>

<li> The display turns on randomly without anyone stepping on it.</li>

    <li> As others have mentioned this scale is very inaccurate. I weighed 5 different times within a 10 minute period and each time got a different result that varied by as much as 5lbs. I like how the scale interacted with the app but if the data is inaccurate there is no point. The cheap drugstore scale that I have registered the same weight or within a few tenths of a pound every time as I tried it to compare. I do not recommend this scale and feel that they do not have a good quality control of their production as some people have reported no issues.</li>
    <li> I have only had this scale for a couple of weeks but it works great. Setup was a snap. Bluetooth syncs up quickly with my iPhone 6 Plus. The WiTscale app allows you to store your past weight, BMI and body fat percentage and send the information to your Apple&#x27;s Health app in iOS 8. Would have preferred a different color than pink. Otherwise for the price and functionality, it provides exceptional value!</li>
    <li> It was good while it worked but out of nowhere it started changing between units by itself. The display turns on randomly without anyone stepping on it. It seems it has a mind of its own. The worst part is the button in the back that should allow you to switch back to lbs does not respond so I am left either trying to do conversions or left to buy a new scale.</li>
    <li> Not too satisfied.  You can&#x27;t see the advanced features like body fat, water weight etc on the scale, only on the app. This was not clear on the description, or I missed it. Also, I thought being pink was cute, but it really appears this scale may be designed for someone younger with child sized feet. I&#x27;m a size 7 and my feet cover the whole thing, and it says not to let your feet hang over the edges? If my feet were any bigger, I&#x27;d have no choice. And the scale seems not too accurate. I can get off and on three times and three different weights.</li>
    <li> Works great. No problems with it.</li>
    <li> **Updated The metal contacts have started to rust. Took it down to 2-stars  This scale is great. Love that can sync with iPhone and keep track of weight with app. Also, great feature is can see weight on phone without having to look down at scale. I place phone on counter near scale and watch that.  Only one thing that made it 4 instead of 5 stars...could just be me. Need to be mindful how get on/off scale as can seem a tiny bit tipsy. Make sure footing is centered and not near edge.</li>
    <li> Have to step on about five times for it to work. then will not configure to my ipod or my family. it is cute and my pounds are right but does not work well.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this scale syncs via bluetooth and it worked perfectly with my iPhone 4s.  It&#x27;s lightweight and pink (my favorite color) which is an added bonus for me.  However, the bodyfat measurement is FAR off for me, and I believe it&#x27;s because they use the weight to height calculation to obtain the body fat percentage. I have recently had my body fat percentage calculated with the 7 point caliper test as well as the bodpod system. The 7 point caliper test had me at 19.2% body fat. The bodpod had me at 18.9%. I can deal with the small difference between the two. However this scale had me at.... 30.1%!! Unfortunately, if you are above average build, especially if you are a female (haven&#x27;t had a male try it yet) and you are looking for something to measure your body fat percentage DO NOT use this.  BTW, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6, 139 lbs and mostly solid!!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this amazing body fat scale from Amazon two weeks ago and we started sharing our weight/bmi/body fat data in a single mini-ipad. It is just so fun to do that together. Even we don&#x27;t use it everyday, however, it will be really helpful to keep tracking for long period of time for record. It is good that we don&#x27;t need to deal with any setup because the app will ask me to turn on Bluetooth and accept to connect.  I never thought of having my fitness information saved in my personal handheld device. It is great. So far I don&#x27;t have any issue except it will be nice to allowing me to record and share my weight measurement to myfitnesspal apps. I also wonder when it will support android so that my husband can use his nexus 4.</li>
    <li> This scale is inaccurate. I can weigh myself 5 times and get 5 different weights in a matter of seconds. The app works well, but I don&#x27;t have any faith in the accuracy of the scale or the body fat measurements. If you don&#x27;t care if the scale is off by a few pounds, then I guess it&#x27;s alright.</li>
    <li> Love this scale - works great, the bluetooth works very well.  Keeps me on track for my weight loss goals.  And the color is great as a plus too.</li>
    <li> was very easy to setup and works great. I love it and looking to get another one as a gift for my mother.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Purchased this product and I have been pleased with it. Extremely easy to sync and use. Keeping track of my weight!</li>
    <li> Hands down, this is the best scale. It is so accurate and is so convenient.  It syncs instantly to my phone app and can also record multiple users.  I love how it measures The color is very pretty and it is made well. I love it!</li>
    <li> Item did not pair with my phone</li>
    <li> Great product and it synced right away with the IPhone 6</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this scale.  I track my weight daily and just the thought of having an accurate scale that would keep up with those numbers was very appealing.  And I love pink, so perfect fit.  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t get it to pair with my iphone5.  I have the latest operating system and bluetooth works fine with my car, so no problems there.  It just doesn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a lemon,  but I saw on the internet other folks have had difficulty pairing as well.  All the reviews on here are positive and indicate no problems, so I thought I should warn potential buyers there may or may not be issues.  I&#x27;ll be returning and haven&#x27;t decided whether to try if another will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because the weight seems to be consistent for the most part.  But I didn&#x27;t pay $80 for just a consistent scale.</li>
    <li> very nice color and quality</li>
    <li> With exception to the color it works great and helps me keep track of my health</li>
    <li> When I first bought this scale, I was completely bummed that it didn&#x27;t work with our iPhone 4 dinosaurs.  Should have thought of that and read closer.  A year later, we finally upgraded our phones to the iPhone 6, and I tried the scale again.  I&#x27;m in love.  I&#x27;ve used it non-stop for two months now, and watching my fat % go down (albeit slowly) has been crazy motivating.  I hate the pink color, but I&#x27;m cheap and it was the least expensive model.  When this one eventually dies, I&#x27;ll know that it&#x27;s worth the money to go ahead and get a better looking one.</li>
