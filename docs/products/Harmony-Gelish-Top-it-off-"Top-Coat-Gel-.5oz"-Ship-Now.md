    <li> Very nice product, goes on nicely and gives a great shine! I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve quit getting my nails done at the salon. This stuff lasts forever and makes my nails strong. I&#x27;ve quit wearing acrylics. Yea!</li>
    <li> This top coat keeps a shine very well.  I prefer Gelish over other brands.  Easy application and easy to remove.</li>

    <li> As everyone say .... Gelish Top Coat is the best. Set in 30 sec with LED.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use alcohol to wipe off sticky residue for that shiny look.&lt;br /&gt;Works on real nails and tips and other brands of color gel polish.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick. I have tried many other top coats and this one is by far the best. Can&#x27;t beat the price. I used to buy the mini bottles for the same price. This is a winner.</li>
    <li> I looooove gelish top coat and for this price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Package came early and I ordered 2at the same time(not sure if that makes a difference) will buy through seller again</li>
    <li> I used acrylic nails for 7 years, i try to taste new products. I used this product, but in 15 days the gel gone</li>
    <li> Awesome. Best gel polish ever !</li>

    <li> Great price! Love lots of top coat!</li>
    <li> This is the only gel top coat I use on my clients in my salon. I also use Gelish Foundation base coat. I use various brands of gel polish colors, but Gelish is the only brand I trust for base and top. 2 to 4 weeks of wear and could go even longer, if it wasn&#x27;t for regrowth gap. Outstanding product!!</li>
    <li> I love the gelish top coat. My friend has an off brand top coat and hers is not nearly as shiny as mine. I did  one finger of mine and one of her brand that she got from Sephora and you could definitely see that the gelish had waayyy more shine. I love it!</li>
    <li> Received it earlier than expected *thumbs up* :)&lt;br /&gt;Decent size bottle :) Very happy!</li>
