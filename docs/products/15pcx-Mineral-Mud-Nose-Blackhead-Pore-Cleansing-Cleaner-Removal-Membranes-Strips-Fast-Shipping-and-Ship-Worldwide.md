<ol>
    <li> Not strips at all. Total mush is each package.</li>
    <li> I received this item really quickly.  I bought it for my son and he swears by this stuff.  Really good product.</li>
    <li> Work great just left my nose dry</li>
    <li> Its okay. Not as good as they say it is.</li>
    <li> Peeling this off is fun, but it leaves black residue around the perimeter of where you placed it. I have not noticed any change in my skin yet - this definitely isn&#x27;t like a Biore strip type product. Maybe continued use will rid my nose of blackheads. I&#x27;ll keep you posted!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT THIS PRODUCT WORKS !! MY POUR WERE GONE IN JUST THE SECOND TIME USING THIS PRODUCT !! MUST BUY THE PRICE IS GREAT !!</li>
    <li> I love these. the peel masks you buy in the store you hardly feel anything. but these are really good. the packets are good if you aren&#x27;t sure you&#x27;ll like them. but I already baught a full tube. and i have some more packets i&#x27;m guvung to friend. these are GREAT</li>
    <li> Saw videos online of this stuff being used. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Awesome product . Works very well</li>
    <li> The mineral mud nose work great . I give them 5stars</li>
    <li> Not strips this is like goo. I read it was pour strips so I ordered, and I received like black goo in a packet. The instructions are in I think Chinese so no way to understand directions so I threw in the trash. DO NOT BUY these &#x27;strips&#x27; totally not what is advertised.</li>
    <li> Terrible!!!  Not even close to working to clear pores. This is a scam!!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but it is not efficient as nose strips.</li>
    <li> these are super fun to use. A little messy and take around thirty minutes to set up. However ive used four packets now and haven&#x27;t had any luck with blackhead removal, which was the main reason I bought them. Back to Biore</li>
    <li> Not as good as it was sad to be</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as they said it would its the worst product</li>
    <li> Removes most blackheads effectively, but not all. Takes a while to dry enough to be able to peel off. Overall, I would recommend. Just make sure to steam/use hot water on your face first.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get any blackheads off and it&#x27;s a MESSSS! Dark black and sticks to everything!</li>
