      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a better mascara becuase</li>
      <li>Love the way this mascara goes on.  </li>
      <li>I have tried and rejected many.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t imagine why even better mascaras don&#x27;t do what even the cheapest used to.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara wand I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Get up and Grow is a fairly healthy formula compared to many mascaras.</li>
      <li>I really love the application, the way my lashes look, and the paraben free</li>

      <li>After 2 months or so of using this product, I saw a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this mascara.</li>
      <li>Thanks Almay for this amazing miracle product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking for a paraben free and PPD free mascara</li>
      <li>I quickly reminded her about her awesome mascara and told her to just keep putting it on everyday.</li>
      <li>Lashes feel totally clean.</li>
      <li>It makes my lashes full and lengthy and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
      <li>I recommend using this product at once or twice a week to get the full effect.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good mascara for years and have finally found it.  </li>
      <li>After adjusting to such a different style of applicator brush, this has been the best mascara I&#x27;ve used in my 15+ years of wearing makeup.</li>
      <li>The mascara dries quickly, which is a plus.</li>
      <li>She was lucky that it didn&#x27;t burn her.</li>
      <li>This is a great value product for everyday use.</li>
      <li>It has all these small &#x27;hairs&#x27; that get through every lash and the results are beautiful natural looking and stylish.</li>
      <li>definitely worth buying.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very excited with my results so far.</li>
      <li>I never noticed it helping my lashes grow at all, but I&#x27;ve always had naturally long lashes and liked the way this mascara emphasized that (my lashes are blond).</li>
      <li>I have the kind of itchy, dry eyes that can&#x27;t even wear contact lenses.</li>
      <li>Its the first time I have ever done so because its my go to</li>
      <li>I decided to try this one because it was one of the few that had a good health rating.  </li>
      <li>I bought Almay mascara due to my very sensitive eyes, but was absolutely delighted the product exceeded my expectations in every way.  </li>
      <li>I prefer a mascara that is easy to entirely remove (for easy removal, I recommend Physiscian&#x27;s Formula Organic Wear mascaras as they remove very easily with water and very little soap or oil, but are very sensistive to tears and moisture, so they can run a bit).</li>
      <li>Sure, most mascaras tend to dry out after a few months, but as long as it gives me long, beautiful lashes, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>I use this for everyday and keep the better performing ones for special occasions.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, and when I touch my eyelashes they feel super soft.</li>
      <li>I decided to choose this mascara as Almay has recently gone cruelty free</li>
      <li>and I think it really does help your lashes grow/regrow and thicken.</li>
      <li>I really like the brush on this mascara because it really separates your lashes.</li>
      <li>How can that be, when it so readily smudges away throughout the day?</li>
      <li>it wears really well.</li>
      <li>This one takes two soapings to really get off my lashes.</li>
      <li>This also leaves my lashes much longer than Buxom Lash</li>
      <li>This Friday night I removed the mascara as described, feeling my lashes carefully to make sure it was all removed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s making my lashes grow, but I really didn&#x27;t expect it to.</li>
      <li>My last Almay product, intense I-color volumizing mascara, was far better.</li>
      <li>My lashes are much healthier</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really bummed about this.</li>
      <li>I sometimes have a problem with clumps of product, but that&#x27;s minor and easily taken care of.</li>
      <li>I like the big, full wand, which makes application fast.</li>
      <li>This mascara is great for day or night because it builds well and can go from natural to a more dramatic look (I sometimes still add a coat of a more dramatic mascara if I am going out).  </li>
      <li>I was looking online and this one was highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It covers lashes all the way to the tip (and a little beyond:-) and upholds the curl I put there with my eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>Normally I don&#x27;t have any issues when I get waterproof mascara</li>
      <li>This accident left her with stubs for eyelashes on her right eye.</li>
      <li>First coat from root to tip, second coat just on the tops to add on itself for a little more length.</li>
      <li>As I get older, it seems I become increasingly allergic and sensitive to products.</li>
      <li>Very soft and natural-looking length, instead of that spide eye look some mascaras give you.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: 4 months later, and I&#x27;m finding that adding the lavender oil to the mascara has really done the trick!  </li>
      <li>I started using this mascara for its claim that it helps your eyelashes grow because after many years of using maybelline lashblast and other mascaras my eyelashes started falling a lot and became short.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m SO glad I did, this stuff works just as good, if not better, than any of the expensive mascaras I had been purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The last time I bought a new tube, I was convinced that the formula had changed—it made my lashes clumpy without adding much length.</li>
      <li>It gives me volume and length while still having the natural look.</li>
      <li>But it never seems to come off completely.</li>
      <li>and it is not irritating my eyes, nor do I feel I have to rush home to remove it after several hours.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For those with sensitive eyes or with allergies, this also doesn&#x27;t sting or burn in any way.</li>
      <li>my least favorite of the Almay mascara line.</li>
      <li>and I have somewhat sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>And it doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>coat really does do the trick in terms of leaving your lashes long, soft, and fluttery!</li>
      <li>I can wear it for about four hours (normally workday, not humid outside, etc.)</li>
      <li>I have had problems with clumping when I first open a new tube, but that&#x27;s to be expected with any mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is it dries very quickly which makes it hard to apply another coat.</li>
      <li>I used to buy every new mascara on the market and layer several brands to get the look I wanted (one for length another for volume).  </li>
      <li>not only is the formula no longer any good, but the brush is useless as well.</li>
      <li>But, it does seem to dry out and flake more than it should after only a few hours.  </li>
      <li>After only a few weeks her lashes were not only back they were and still are amazingly full and longer than she has ever had them in her life.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought Almay mascara due to my very sensitive eyes, but was absolutely delighted the product exceeded my expectations in every way.  I hope they never discontinue this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it is very important for skin care ... Do not use other brands. It is a good quality product, recognized in the market and a good price.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT REAL DOES DO WHAT IT SAYS, &amp;#34;Get Up and Grow&amp;#34; My daughter has been using this for the past year and will not buy anything else! She accidentally singed off her eyelashes due to a high flame that came out of our b.b.q. this past summer. She was lucky that it didn&#x27;t burn her. This accident left her with stubs for eyelashes on her right eye. Needless to say she was devastated! I quickly reminded her about her awesome mascara and told her to just keep putting it on everyday. After only a few weeks her lashes were not only back they were and still are amazingly full and longer than she has ever had them in her life. Thanks Almay for this amazing miracle product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this mascara. It&#x27;s a nice dark black, and it really does give me long, thick lashes with just one to two coats. I sometimes have a problem with clumps of product, but that&#x27;s minor and easily taken care of. This is a great value product for everyday use.</li>
    <li> After only a week I am already noticing that my eyelashes are longer. I decided to choose this mascara as Almay has recently gone cruelty free and I&#x27;m very excited with my results so far.</li>
    <li> I have been on a run of mascaras lately. I have tried and rejected many. I&#x27;m looking for a paraben free and PPD free mascara and I have somewhat sensitive eyes. I prefer a mascara that is easy to entirely remove (for easy removal, I recommend Physiscian&#x27;s Formula Organic Wear mascaras as they remove very easily with water and very little soap or oil, but are very sensistive to tears and moisture, so they can run a bit). Get up and Grow is a fairly healthy formula compared to many mascaras. I like the big, full wand, which makes application fast. The mascara dries quickly, which is a plus. It does tend to accumulate in the undereye area throughout the day, giving you an undereye shadow. For that, I just check at lunchtime and use a little lotion to wipe away any smudges. I really love the application, the way my lashes look, and the paraben free formula.&lt;br /&gt;The con for me is that I find this mascara strangely difficult to remove. How can that be, when it so readily smudges away throughout the day? Weird. I use soap and water to remove mascara. This one takes two soapings to really get off my lashes. Then, after a thorough washing, I still have black under my eyes. I use oil to scrub that off. But it never seems to come off completely. On weekends, I do not wear makeup at all. This Friday night I removed the mascara as described, feeling my lashes carefully to make sure it was all removed. Lashes feel totally clean. Used oil to remove undereye residue. Next morning, I wake up with black under my eyes. Same with Sunday, same with Monday. I remind you, throughout the weekend I applied no mascara at all, yet, Monday morning I am still finding residue. I don&#x27;t want to have to soap up twice and then scrub with oil to remove mascara from the delicate skin of my eyelids. So, unfortunately, I will not be able to continue to use this mascara.</li>
    <li> Despite rave reviews (both here and in beauty magazines), I hated this mascara.  While it&#x27;s labeled brown black, it&#x27;s a true black and much too dark for my taste.  It also clumps very badly during application, and flakes and smudges so much that I have racoon eyes within an hour. I tried for two weeks before throwing away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of a mascara addict.  I had been buying Tarte&#x27;s &amp;#34;lights, camera, lashes!&amp;#34; from Sephora, but I was sick of paying $19 a tube.  It also didn&#x27;t have the best &amp;#34;health&amp;#34; rating from that skin deep website. I decided to try this one because it was one of the few that had a good health rating.  I&#x27;m SO glad I did, this stuff works just as good, if not better, than any of the expensive mascaras I had been purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s making my lashes grow, but I really didn&#x27;t expect it to. It&#x27;s just awesome mascara and that&#x27;s all I wanted!</li>
    <li> It does build up lashes well but will clump and eventually flak somewhat. It seems, they all do these days. Can&#x27;t imagine why even better mascaras don&#x27;t do what even the cheapest used to. So I would rate this as quite good.</li>
    <li> I have the kind of itchy, dry eyes that can&#x27;t even wear contact lenses. I&#x27;d pretty much given up on finding a mascara I could wear without being miserable and red-eyed by the end of the day. But this is great, and I never have problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it wears really well. Very soft and natural-looking length, instead of that spide eye look some mascaras give you.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore. It gives me volume and length while still having the natural look.</li>
    <li> It goes on well, but if you rub your eyes, or use contact solution in them, prepare to look like you  have black eyes. Smudges way too easily.</li>
    <li> I review this mascara everywhere and have to tell my fellow ladies to buy it. It&#x27;s wonderful, clump free, smooth, adds great thickness and length and I think it really does help your lashes grow/regrow and thicken. One complaint would be that while it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;one coat&amp;#34; I usually use two on my top lashes. First coat from root to tip, second coat just on the tops to add on itself for a little more length. This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> It is a little dry-ish, but I have had no problem getting it to go on and it looks good!  It covers lashes all the way to the tip (and a little beyond:-) and upholds the curl I put there with my eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for so long that I can&#x27;t remember what mascara I used before it. I never noticed it helping my lashes grow at all, but I&#x27;ve always had naturally long lashes and liked the way this mascara emphasized that (my lashes are blond). I have had problems with clumping when I first open a new tube, but that&#x27;s to be expected with any mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m writing this review is because I can no longer recommend this product. The last time I bought a new tube, I was convinced that the formula had changed—it made my lashes clumpy without adding much length. But still, I used it, and once the tube was almost empty I had decided I was wrong, because the smaller the amount of mascara on the brush, the better my lashes looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when that one ran out, I bought another tube. With this one, the brush is an entirely different shape. There is no length to the bristles; it&#x27;s a narrow, stick-like brush that hardly even looks like a brush at all. Using it was like trying to use a pipe cleaner to apply mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So not only is the formula no longer any good, but the brush is useless as well. I&#x27;ll be trying something different from now on.</li>
    <li> I know there is a lot of good reviews on this brand, but it bothered my eyes. I also wasn&#x27;t a fan of the wand. I prefer a longer and thinner wand. This was bulky and the actual product got very think in  a few weeks clumping lashes bad. Not a fan of the formula or the wand.</li>
    <li> The mascara is just average. Mine was on the dry side. Will not buy again. My last Almay product, intense I-color volumizing mascara, was far better.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. I&#x27;ve been looking for a better mascara becuase I&#x27;m tired of clumping, flaking, smelly, and irritating mascara product&#x27;s. I was looking online and this one was highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the item and the brush is amazing. It has all these small &#x27;hairs&#x27; that get through every lash and the results are beautiful natural looking and stylish. No smell no clumping no flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product will order again.</li>
    <li> Normally I don&#x27;t have any issues when I get waterproof mascara but... this just give me raccoon eyes.  I can wear it for about four hours (normally workday, not humid outside, etc.) and then I have to wipe the mascara under my eyes off.  Threw it out, so disappointing.  Going back to my usual CG in the yellow container - hasn&#x27;t failed me yet!</li>
    <li> Wore it five different days, every day I had raccoon eyes!  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It doesn&#x27;t clump, and when I touch my eyelashes they feel super soft. I havent had any issues with this stuff yet- definitely worth buying. Oh! And it doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive eyes so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good mascara for years and have finally found it.  Sure, most mascaras tend to dry out after a few months, but as long as it gives me long, beautiful lashes, it&#x27;s worth it.  One coat of Almay in the am and I&#x27;m set for the day.  They&#x27;re fluttery and separate all day long.  Beautiful!</li>
    <li> I usually alternate between Cover Girl&#x27;s Lash Blast in the orange tube or Buxom Lash, but Buxom Lash is a bit spendy.  Based on the good reviews of this Almay mascara, I decided to give this a try. I&#x27;ve been using it now for a few months, and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One coat really does do the trick in terms of leaving your lashes long, soft, and fluttery! I&#x27;ve been trying to put on a second coat even though I don&#x27;t need to, and that&#x27;s when I get a bit of clumping. If I take my time, start at the base of the lash, and gently roll the brush to the tip, I really do just need one coat. This also leaves my lashes much longer than Buxom Lash ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve been using the same tube for several months, and it hasn&#x27;t dried out on me at all, the way that it did for another reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with sensitive eyes or with allergies, this also doesn&#x27;t sting or burn in any way. It&#x27;s a bit harder to remove than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried, but I like that it stays on and doesn&#x27;t smear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeper, and definitely is a contender for my mainstay mascara!</li>
    <li> Arrived before due date. Excellent product</li>
    <li> As I get older, it seems I become increasingly allergic and sensitive to products. This has been especially true for any cosmetics I would put on my eyes or under my eyes. Any mascara that is &#x27;not&#x27; waterproof ends up all under my eyes, despite the fact Im not sweating nor do I have oily skin.  Yes, I enjoyed the waterproof Lash Blast, but by the end of the day, it&#x27;s heavy and clumpy and slightly irritating to my skin. I bought the Almay Get up and Grow Waterproof Mascara and it is not irritating my eyes, nor do I feel I have to rush home to remove it after several hours. At this point, to find an inexpensive (which is all I can afford)mascara that gives me some definition without irritation, Almay achieves this. TIP: Kroger had sale prices on this, but they didn&#x27;t carry the waterproof. Bought the Waterproof at Walgreens.</li>
    <li> My eyes easily get irritated by makeup and this mascara is less harsh than others I have used.  It does build well and looks good.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with clumping.</li>
    <li> I have super thin, short eyelashes. I have used many expensive mascaras but have always came back to the Almay one coat. It makes my lashes full and lengthy and doesn&#x27;t clump. Happy customer right here. I plan on using this indefinitely.</li>
    <li> After adjusting to such a different style of applicator brush, this has been the best mascara I&#x27;ve used in my 15+ years of wearing makeup. With two coats and some black eyeliner, my lashes look long and thick (but not clumpy) even though they&#x27;re neither. These are like putting on false lashes every day, except you don&#x27;t have to worry about them sliding or falling off. Never discontinue this, Almay!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara!  I do have fairly naturally good lashes but I swear by this stuff.  I used to buy every new mascara on the market and layer several brands to get the look I wanted (one for length another for volume).  This mascara is great for day or night because it builds well and can go from natural to a more dramatic look (I sometimes still add a coat of a more dramatic mascara if I am going out).  My lashes are much healthier (I did not realize other formulas were drying and that dry eyelashes was a thing), seem longer, and do not fall out as much.  I replace mine about every three months (which is how often you are supposed to avoid bacteria) bc it dries out.  Its the first time I have ever done so because its my go to and I use it so often.  Would highly recommend at the very least for your everyday mascara!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara wand I&#x27;ve ever used. However, this formula is awful. I have raccoon eyes after about three hours in temperate weather and I&#x27;ve never had that happen to me before. I&#x27;m really bummed about this. Will not repurse until they reformulate</li>
    <li> I started using this mascara for its claim that it helps your eyelashes grow because after many years of using maybelline lashblast and other mascaras my eyelashes started falling a lot and became short. After 2 months or so of using this product, I saw a huge difference. My eyelashes started to get longer and fuller. I recommend using this product at once or twice a week to get the full effect.</li>
    <li> Wish it lasted longer</li>
    <li> I find the Get up and Grow Mascara my least favorite of the Almay mascara line. I can only use Almay as my eyes become itchy and painful with any other mascara. The Get Up and Grow seems to be less noticeable on my lashes. I have found this before, but keep trying thinking I may have gotten a bad one. They all perform the same for me. I use this for everyday and keep the better performing ones for special occasions.</li>
    <li> I really like the brush on this mascara because it really separates your lashes. The one thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is it dries very quickly which makes it hard to apply another coat.</li>
    <li> Love the way this mascara goes on.  The brush is perfect for lifting and separating the lashes.  But, it does seem to dry out and flake more than it should after only a few hours.  I&#x27;ve added a drop of lavender essential oil to the container to see if it will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 4 months later, and I&#x27;m finding that adding the lavender oil to the mascara has really done the trick!  And, an added bonus, it seems to be helping my lashes grow - so now happier with the mascara, and with my lashes.  I keep trying other mascara brands, and keep coming back to this one.  I still wish it would last longer and not flake off on it&#x27;s own, but it&#x27;s my favorite mascara I&#x27;ve found in a while (after adding the oil).</li>
