<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this brush because I had already owned the E40 which is already very similar to the MAC 224. But when I got it I was able to tell the difference in the two brushes. The first thing is the bristles on the brush are a tad been longer in length than the E40. And then the next thing is the brush is slimmer than the E40. The last thing is the brush has more bristles meaning it is more dense. This helps with a more controlled blending. I think that the brush is great and I may purchase another!</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush. I used to buy MAC brushes until I opened my eyes to Sigma brushes, which I feel are just as good, if not better than MAC. The price point for Sigma brushes makes it a better option for me. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I HAVE SEEN SO MANY YOU TUBE VIDEO&#x27;S ABOUT SIGMA AND THIS IS ONE OF MY 1ST BRUSHES FROM THEM, IT&#x27;S THE BEST IF YOU WANT A GOOD BRUSH AND GOOD CRAFT MENSHIP GO WITH SIGMA~ I ALSO HAVE A VIDEO ON MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL LATOYA47</li>
    <li> Love this brush!!! Authetic and easy to clean</li>
    <li> just receive my first sigma E35 brush great for blending eye shadows have been looking for a good eye shadow brush, will be purchasing more from sigma.</li>
    <li> Probably one of my top favorite brushes from Sigma so far, I love this brush! I used just this brush to do my eye look with the exception of the lid area, this brush is really great for any crease work! I love how soft it is as well. This brush is definitely a must in your collection~</li>
    <li> Per usual, Sigma has a great brush. You literally cannot go wrong when ording one of these brushes. This one does a particularly fantastic job of getting color in the crease and blending out all over the eye. In addition, if you are looking for a light wash of color all over, this brush is perfect for it!</li>
    <li> Sigma beauty brushes are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! The quality, is perfect... I already have a complete collection of the brushes, but i always buy a few extras because they are wonderful!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally receive my brushes. I ordered the \\&quot;Eye Kit\\&quot; and five additional brushes to have the full set of eye brushes. I ripped the box open to find all the brushes in a cute mesh bag with a drawstring and each brush was in its own little plastic sleeve, none of the bristles has been bent or crumpled at a quick glance. There was a little card that explained to first clean before use soooo I did. No shedding &amp; no dye flowed thur the soapy clear water :o). Once dry I went to apply my shadows with and the brush felt like silk in combination with my eye primer &amp; eye shadows. I got a little more excited and decided to do the foiling technique....OMG!!! FLAWLESS!!! I soon found myself using each and every brush. The brushes are not heavily weighted so they really felt comfortable &amp; easy to control unlike other brushes I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m looking forward to passing the word about Sigma. I recommend these brushed to anyone who is looking for the perfect brushes at a affordable price - the next order will be the face brushes.</li>
    <li> Not going to lie, at first i was skeptical about spending $11 on ONE brush, because i never tried sigma before but once i tried this brush i was AMAZED! it works so wonderfully! All the hype you hear about these brushes is true! I will be purchasing more from them in the future!</li>
    <li> The brushes feel sturdy and well made, and the bristles are super soft as well! I really recommend this brand, same quality as M.A.C but 1/3 of the price. (:</li>
    <li> Everyone raves about the Sigma brushes, so I needed to try them out. They are now my go-to brushes! They are just the right density and give the correct amount of pressure. Now I understand what make-up artists mean when they say &amp;#34;let the brush do the work for you&amp;#34;. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I just received these last night and after I opened them I was so impressed with the feel of the brush in my hand I had to use them! I love that even tho all 3 brushes I ordered (E35, E25 and E30) were different sizes all of them had the same feel in my hand. Kinda like holding a pencil. So I washed my face and put on more makeup! I chose a style that would allow me to use all of them, and use them the way they are meant to be used. There was no shedding and they felt nice and solid in my hand. . The 2 bigger blending brushes worked great and the smaller pencil brush was very precise without being too stiff. After I got done with them I washed them and all 3 came clean without any problems. I normally wash new brushes before I use them, but I couldn&#x27;t wait and I knew I&#x27;d be washing off the makeup I was going to be putting on. I checked them this morning and again they dried well and still no shedding. Out of the 3 I&#x27;m pretty sure the pencil brush will be my go to brush , but that also could be because of the way I do my makeup everyday. I would like to say that I saw on a review from someone that she was upset that Sigma does offer a free gift if you leave a review and yes they do, however they don&#x27;t say anywhere on the card that it has to be a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it blends my eyeshadow so nicely. I also love the F80 kabuki brush, sigma brushes work so good and are very affordable.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I was told by a friend from Brazil that this was very good quality Brushes and she was right! Plus the delivery was very quick, well packed and I could track it!</li>
    <li> This product has just arrived today and already really like it. It&#x27;s really soft and fluffy which I think is really important in a blending brush. It blends eyeshadow seamlessly and I love it, it&#x27;s the best blending brush I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Okay, I got this brush and wasn&#x27;t expecting the best blending brush ever, but it actually works PERFECTLY. I like to use it for placing dark colors for definition in my outer corner/crease, and then blend it lighting into the crease and it works wonders for that. The brush came in a plastic bag/covering thing, that was inside an envelope. It wasn&#x27;t the best packaging and the bristles were a bit messed up, but I was washing all my brushes that day anyways so after a nice washing/conditioning they were fine. (The bristles were also a bit hard before a wash, I&#x27;m sure if you don&#x27;t wash it every once in a while it&#x27;ll go back to being semi-hard, but it isn&#x27;t painful to use or anything)&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a wonderful brush, it does it&#x27;s job perfectly. I would recommend this to anybody that is looking for an affordable blending brush that does exactly what it&#x27;s name suggests - blends.</li>
    <li> Another terrific Sigma brush! This not only lays color down neatly, but it blends any harsh lines so that you have a neat, precise look. The bristles are amazingly soft and easy to clean. A great addition to your Sigma or other brush kits!!</li>
    <li> This sigma brush is amazing. Light fluffy and does the job perfectly. I love it so much. I&#x27;ve gone thru a few different kinds of blending brushes and they were either not as soft as described or they just didn&#x27;t do anything. Sigma is great. This E35 brush is my new favorite. :)</li>
    <li> Perfect for working in crease. It&#x27;s firm enough to be precise but also fluffy enough for blending. Loved it so much I had to buy another.</li>
    <li> So I have been watching a lot of makeup tutorials on YouTube and noticed that they were using Sigma makeup brushes. I needed a good blending brush, so while searching for products on Amazon, I found the Sigma Tapered Blending -E35 brush. I LOVE this brush!! It&#x27;s very soft &amp; does exactly what it is suppose to... Blend that crease area for your eyeshadow so there are no harsh lines. It&#x27;s easy to clean too. Will definitely be buying other brushes from Sigma&#x27;s line!</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve bought a sigma brushes and definitely fell in love with it. It&#x27;s natural bristles are great for blending, and is kind of to my MAC 224. I definitely recommend this product and by the way the price is very affordable.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Package was shipped and delivered quickly. Pricing is very reasonable compared to mac brushes. So far, I&#x27;ve only washed it once and its had just the tiniest bit of shedding, but that,was it.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft and great for blending in the crease. It is my go to everyday make up brush.</li>
    <li> Great for blending! Definitely worth the investment :)</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a make-up designer in paris. i find that this brush is a \\&quot; professionnal brush\\&quot;. i work for tv,cinema and weddings and sigma brushes are indispensable!! in french , you say \\&quot; c&#x27;est une valeure sure!!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought dare sigma by a friend and I loved the brush inside..Then, by Amazon, I get this brush and it&#x27;s perfect for my eyes  elza donato,from Brazil</li>
    <li> I ordered the sigma beauty brushes because they have come highly recommended and I do not regret it! They are great brushes, but I was expecting something a little softer-- I find the eco tools to be softer, but these do the job I wanted them to do!(:</li>
    <li> Arrived promply, package well, and I love, love this brush.  I had no idea what a biggg  difference a good brush made in the way your make up looks.. This brush is an eyeshadow, and my shadow now looks like shadow instead a smeared mess!</li>
    <li> So upset this brush ended up being fake. The picture is not accurate at all. You can feel it in the weight. I compared it to my actual real ones I have from the actual sigma store. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality very sift</li>
    <li> Decided to buy sigma brushes after reading all the positive reviews.  So I invested my money on several brushes. This review is on the E35 tapered blending brush.  After the first use, the hair started fraying and coming out.  I was very disappointed.  Quickly submitted a return ticket.  I have purchased a replacement from a different vendor, hoping that I got a lemon.  With the new one, I see a single hair begin to pull out.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on with the E35.  My other brushes so far, is holding up well and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> The 1st few times I used this brush, I would have random white hairs on my face from the brush.  After the 1st wash, I haven&#x27;t noticed a single hair.  Love it now!  Super easy to blend eyeshadow!!</li>
    <li> perfection for transitions colors, sigma  never ceases to amaze me. i love how easily it blends, you need this brush in your life, i cant even imagine not having it! it is so amazing</li>
    <li> What can I say about this brush? Its truly is the most affordable brush but good quality! I love how it gets in the crease and buffs out any harsh lines! This brush will make you want to buy more brushes from Sigma!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good brush, and I probably use it more than any other eyeshadow brush. The build is nice and sturdy, doesn&#x27;t feel like it will fall apart any time soon. The bristles aren&#x27;t particularly soft, definitely have a fair amour of resistance to them, but they aren&#x27;t scratchy in any way. The main reason why I took one star off is because after the first wash some of the bristles starter sticking out to the sides quite a bit, which is annoying during makeup application- I did shape the brush and dried it properly. That&#x27;s fairly disappointing. I realize that happens to natural hair brushes, but somehow out of all natural brushes I own, only this one has this issue.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, the verdict is: decent blending brush, but by far not the best.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush !! I cant do my make up without it, great for the the transition color , love it</li>
    <li> I reach for this brush every single day. It is my go to blending brush. Works great in the eye crease and blends shadows out flawlessly. A great brush from Sigma.</li>
    <li> Love the brush.  Unfortunately the packaging was not great because the brush came out and was thrown around the box and the bristles were a mess but I just washed the brush to get them back, just a little inconvenient.  I would put the brushes in a sealed plastic baggy.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with sigma! Everyone needs a great blending brush! This brush is great. Longer bristles but you need that for blending out in the upper crease area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of makeup tutorials on YouTube and I kept hearing about Sigma brand brushes. A lot of the make artists that I liked were using them, amongst a bunch of others, so I thought I&#x27;d give a few a try. I just had a very basic brush set from Eco Tools that I got at Walmart but wanted a few more specific for eyes. So, it does the job, ive used it for eye shadow blending, but its not a favorite by far and I&#x27;ve gone back to my trusty Eco Tools and Real Techniques brushes which I think are excellent. I&#x27;ve had this particular Sigma brush, I bought 3 total, for less than a week and I&#x27;ve already had a significant amount of bristles fall out and I&#x27;ve washed them twice.&lt;br /&gt;So overall, not bad but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again, don&#x27;t think the extra $$ for a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; is worth it for me.</li>
    <li> MUST HAVE FOR ANY MAKE UP ENTHUSIAST... This brush does the blending for you,  i recommend this one and the E25 perfect combo</li>
    <li> Sigma Tapered Blending - E35 is very good. The Sigma brushes are very soft and cute. Loved it! is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> good product. quick shipping. No problems</li>
    <li> I love it!! Can&#x27;t see anything else. Great brush!</li>
    <li> My favorite brushes!!!</li>
    <li> I Love the brush!!!&lt;br /&gt;Is easy to use and it works great!!!&lt;br /&gt;Is super soft so when you use it it doesnt hurt your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigma is the best by far!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend $$$$ on MAC brushes. These Sigma brushes are excellent and blend beautifully. I am not a professional makeup artist, but did my friend&#x27;s makeup for her recent wedding and everyone commented on how wonderful her eyeshadow looked. I owe that in part to the these brushes and how well they work!</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for blending eyeshadow. NO shedding, perfect softness. Must have! wish the price was cheaper but its worth it</li>
    <li> Finishing your makeup application with a blending brush is a MUST and this brush is perfect! I highly recommend it if you are looking for a great brush to create the smokey crease or just everyday crease application. It is easy to work with and the brush does all the work.</li>
    <li> Not actual sigma brushes. I used it for awhile it was crap and now regretting I bought this crap. Don&#x27;t buy it you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was too big for my eyes, but lately I have been using it with not problems at all, it feels soft and blends really good on my crease!! Definitely will keep buying more Sigma brushes!! thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> This Brush is fantastic! Its just like MAC 217 but better and half the price! I cant wait to buy a whole set! SIGMA ROCKS!</li>
    <li> Great brush. I was skeptical about buying these brushes, wondering what all the hype was over this style of blending brush. I&#x27;m gald I gave in. This brush really gives you much more control over blending out and applying colors to the crease. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing blending brush. It blends eye shadows beautifully! An absolute must have to create the perfect smokey eye look!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality! very well made ZERO shedding and blends eye shadow like a dream I LOVE THIS BRUSH! i am slowly building my Sigma brush collection :) also received it 3 days ahead of schedule which is always awesome! securely packaged to protect the product, all around great service :)</li>
    <li> Got what I wanted and got it fast.</li>
    <li> The E35 brush does a wonderful job of applying that lighter color all over the lid when achieving a blended or smokey eye look. You will have the lighter color on this Brush and the darker color in the crease best applied with the E45. With these two brushes you will blend like a pro only having to swipe back and forth gently until your colors are well blended.</li>
    <li> I love the size &amp; shape of this brush. Bristles are soft too. Perfect for the crease.</li>
    <li> Great brush for blending.</li>
    <li> Like the E25, I use this for blending and it works well enough for that purpose, but I&#x27;ve bought two of these and the cut is different on each one.  For this reason, I use each of them a bit differently.  The bristles also splay a bit on one of my brushes and don&#x27;t hold their shape well.</li>
    <li> This item came earlier than expected in good condition! I&#x27;ll definitely be looking forward to purchasing more. I am so excited to receive all of my brushes, and I can&#x27;t wait to use them!I thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Great for blending :)</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It is a great fluffy tapered blending brush...it is one of my main go to brushes. If you are wanting extra precision try the E36...it is great for cutting a crease and diffusing the line :)</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Sigma brushes. This is an authentic sigma brush so order with confidence. This brush is a must have in every make-up junkie&#x27;s collection.</li>
    <li> I read several professional makeup artist reviews that said the Sigma E35 was comparable to a MAC 224, and for the large difference in price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It was a great idea! I&#x27;m never giving up this brush!</li>
    <li> I use this brush to add color to my crease and then to blend it to create a beautiful effect. works well when doing smoky eye.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and again great product. I use this brush for everything.... everyday and it&#x27;s amazing... Great price and great product :)</li>
    <li> Great blending tool. I definitely love how soft it is and it is very easy to clean! Definitely great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> I like the E35 better than the E40 they do about the same job..</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brush in my collection.  It blends my shadows effortlessly!  It goes with me on all my travels!  It&#x27;s my first Sigma and certainly not my last!  I&#x27;ll be adding several more!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference a brush would make in my makeup application.  This blending brush has made a major difference.  I abosultely love it.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without it and I have only had it a couple of weeks.  Going to order a couple more.</li>
    <li> I really like this Sigma blending brush. I use it almost every time I apply eye shadow. It is great at blending out product onto and around the crease. These sigma brushes are also really good quality brushes and will last a good couple years.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re very easy to clean and are like brand new after I wash them. They are worth the price and will continue to purchase other Sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> Love this so much I bought another one.  Perfect for all over eye shadow application or for the crease.</li>
    <li> I was worried this would be harsh based on the photo (the bristles just looked a little thicker and stiff) but it&#x27;s very soft. It hasn&#x27;t shed, the bristles have just the right amount of bend so you get a soft but targeted application. I use this nearly every day, it&#x27;s a great brush!</li>
    <li> I just received my FIRST sigma brush today! I&#x27;m so excited! It is super soft and gets the job done well! It really does get in my crease and just stays in where I apply the color but doesn&#x27;t leave harsh lines. Also it has very little fall out! I can say for sure it is the best blending brush I have used and can&#x27;t wait to use it for more dramatic looks! Will definitely buy from them again!</li>
    <li> I love the Sigma line of brushes.  The soft texture of the bristles, the precise application and the easy clean-up.  I will never use the more expensive department store brushes again.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Blends like a dream. Love love love this blending brush. Sigma is always amazing quality! Fast shipping and as always I was super pleased with the blending power of this brush. Get it!</li>
    <li> Love this brush used it for applying my paint pot shadows and it gave even application without having to apply so much product</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE this brush! I was worried the bristles would be stiff and rough but the brush is SO soft. Perfect for blending and blurring the lines of your eyeshadow for an airbrushed looked. Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> .I needed good blending brushes but I can’t afford a 25-35$ for a mac brush. So I asked around and seen that sigma are as good as mac but cheaper so I got the E35,E25 E30 E55 E45 and the E40. They are very good and soft, very easy to use and clean. Shipping was fast and I really like them. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5, when I washed them some of the hair came out. It was the first time I cleaned them.  I don’t know if that’s normal or not. I haven’t tried cleaning them again I’m scared.</li>
    <li> Great blending brush. No fall out or shedding &amp; is very soft. Im glad I added it to my collection.</li>
    <li> it is good but the brush hair is nor very smooth i was looking for better quality from sigma as always</li>
    <li> I love this blending brush!  It&#x27;s super soft and perfect for blending colors together at your crease.  It picks up a lot of product (eyeshadow) so there is no need for me to go over my eye again with more.  I own several Sigma brushes and will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I got other products from Sigma and I still haven&#x27;t recieved this one. when I track it, it dosent show anything.</li>
    <li> Love this brush !! No shedding ,</li>
    <li> Good products and good seller.</li>
    <li> i love everything about this brush</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to order this for a while and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It is a great crease and blending eye shadow brush!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday for blending in my crease. This is my go-to brush on the daily. I LOVE IT. Great quality and I even wash the bristles with a little Cetaphil and warm water and it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect eye shadow blending brush. I use it for applying shadow on the brow bone and blending from the crease up. Good quality.</li>
    <li> these products are the best quality.. soft and durable... they are much better than the sephora brand brushes.. will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> This brush did its job perfectly but the only thing that i did not like about it quality. This is my first sigma brush and depending on other reviews, i thought the quality would be better than this.</li>
    <li> I have previously used ELF beauty products because of their low prices but I decided to splurge on this Sigma product and see if their really was any difference. This brush is SO much better when it comes to my eyeshadow application!!!! It is extremely soft and is able to blend my colors perfectly. There is no way I am going back to the cheaper, more coarse brushes. I will always buy Sigma now because the price may be a bit higher but the quality of the product is definitely worth it. Bravo Sigma!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush! I have purchased MAC and Sephora brushes in the past but I have to say this brush beats them all!!! I will certainly be buying more brushes from Sigma. The quality is amazing and blending is unbelievable. This brush gives you perfect precision around the creases of your eyes without the need to blend repeatedly. It&#x27;s smooth every time and has made me love experimenting with different eye shadow colors again!</li>
    <li> Everything fine and on time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not authentic. The one that I received is not authentic, The original ones are made in P.R.C. and this one is made in China and the logo is a little different too. You can tell when you compare them. The seller was: NetRush</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Sigma brushes - for real! They haven&#x27;t made a brush that I don&#x27;t like, yet... They&#x27;re quality, soft,  non-shedding, and very affordable brushes! In my eyes, you can&#x27;t beat that with a stick. All I can say is, BUY THEM, you will love them!</li>
    <li> Great product and quick delivery</li>
