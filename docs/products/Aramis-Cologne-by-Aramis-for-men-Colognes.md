<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use Aramis as my every day after shave. I&#x27;v been looking for the large bottle for some time. Very good price and delivery.</li>
    <li> The perfect size bottle of my favorite cologne.  Every time I have it on, the wife is smiling.  Really like the size of this bottle and the perfect price too.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and at a great price.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne. too bad it is getting too expensive to buy.</li>
    <li> Satisified with product and delivery.  This is a product with which I am very familiar so I had no surprises.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for someone who specifically wanted the spray bottle. Saw it was the only one listed with the word spray on it in the search. Ordered the largest bottle which is the splash, not spray bottle. Be warned: item changes bottle type with the different size.    If Amazon sellers weren&#x27;t such s*** they could write better detailed descriptions instead of a copy/paste from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I love, love to smell this on a man walking by and I adore it on my husband.</li>
    <li> As you may know, Aramis is getting harder to find. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. It was exactly what was advertised.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed this time in the Aramis I ordered for my husband. I chose the large bottle because in the past, my orders have been just fine. This time it seems to be sort of &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;. I can&#x27;t say for sure. I smells sort of like the department store version , just not as strong, and doesn&#x27;t last. I guess you get what you pay for. My bad. Won&#x27;t do it again.</li>
    <li> price was right and on time del. thanks</li>
    <li> Aramis is such an incredible scent! I will never get tired of my husband wearing this. I wish the bottle was the spray instead of pour type though.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A Familiar Product, i HAVE USED IT BEFORE. AND PROBABLY WILL AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. eNOUGH SAID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I have used Aramis for 30 years - best ever for me.&lt;br /&gt;Have tried other products but nothing is as good.</li>
    <li> My husband only uses Aramis and in all the years of buying at the department stores, never had a complaint.  This product however does not smell as strong nor last as long.  Wondering if it the real deal.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it, have been using Aramis for more than 40 years.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells best and lasts longest when you spray it on. I put it into a spray bottle myself. It stays on FOREVER that way, and ladies absolutely go crazy for it. I love the smell too, of course, and put it on daily.</li>
    <li> My father in law is 84 and not used to on line ordering, but he trusted my use of this site. He LOVES his Aramis! It was exactly what he wanted, splash kind so he didn&#x27;t have to use spray bottle. This is a traditional mens scent in our household. Twas the thing that attracted me to my husband, I loved that smell. We have been married 30..prolly thx to Aramis!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my grandfather who specifically asked for the largest bottle I could order.  He&#x27;s been wearing this cologne for years and he loves it.  He was VERY pleased when I presented him with this huge bottle (in comparison to the 3.4 oz size for half the price).  So from Pop-Pop to you: Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The best in the business.</li>
    <li> The only thing my husband wears.  We love it</li>
    <li> I gave this product a perfect score.  I have used this product for many years.  Whenever I want to impress the opposite sex, especially on a first date, I use it conservatively.  A high percentage of women express their fondness for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this product has received many complements, especially from women, I wouldn&#x27;t dare go to a social setting without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I haven&#x27;t tried every similar product currently on the market.  However, Aramis works for me.</li>
    <li> &#x27;Aramis&#x27; is without any doubt an all time classic creation . This is only for matured heavy personality males . When you wear it, it difinitely announes your class, it&#x27;s very different from the others. Longivity is superb, siliage is also superb &amp; the price is moderate. Again, another fragrance from this house - &#x27;Tuscany Per Uomo&#x27; is one step ahead. I thik  both of these great fragrances are best when worn in cold / winter season. My signature fragrance in winter &amp; I am proud to wear.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the lady&#x27;s love it</li>
    <li> Aramis has always been the cologne that attracts many. This cologne is not too heavy but masculine enough to give the man an aura of success. It naturally attracts people to you. This is a great bargain.</li>
