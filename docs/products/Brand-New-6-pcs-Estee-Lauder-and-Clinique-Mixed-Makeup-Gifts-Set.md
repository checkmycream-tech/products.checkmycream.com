      <li>I am a very fair skinned person, look best in blue based shades.</li>
      <li>If you are like me and love to buy cosmetics, this is a good variety of quality cosmetics.  </li>
      <li>The tinted moisturizer is nice.</li>
      <li>Satisfied with the cleanser and lipgloss as well.</li>
      <li>; lotion reminded me that I already tried this product.......for me the product tends to get flaky as I apply make-up over it, my issue maybe, glad it was a sample.</li>
      <li>love all clinique products.  </li>
      <li>The products are OK but was packaged in a ziplock type plastic bag.</li>
      <li>The texture of the lipstick is also very good, it isn&#x27;t sticky yet not dry.</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of brown shadow but the quality of the brown, Chocolate Chip shadow is very good, it stays on all day and unlike Urban Decay eye shadow it doesn&#x27;t drop of the applicator and ruin your already applied under eye concealer.</li>
      <li>Mascara is great for daily wear.  </li>
      <li>So the lipstick does not look good, even with bronzer on it is too yellow based.</li>
      <li>Overall I think this is a great deal for such a price.</li>
      <li>This Clinique eye shadow was pretty close to the colour I was looking for</li>
      <li>The two mascaras are okay, I would have preferred to be only one.</li>
      <li>My personal favorite is the flirt honey lipstick.  </li>
      <li>the lip gloss is pretty neutral, I like it.</li>
      <li>They seemed to be very old merchandise.</li>

    <li> My personal favorite is the flirt honey lipstick.  Mascara is great for daily wear.  Face screams serve as great testers.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and love to buy cosmetics, this is a good variety of quality cosmetics.  The shades are compatible with my medium/light skin color.  I would happily purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> very pleased really excellent product I can recommend it met my expectations so well that I was really very happy thank you</li>
    <li> I was a very good detail for a gift, very useful stuff no woman can deny and very good quality</li>

    <li> me gusto, era lo que esperaba y es de excelente calidad y llego en perfecytas condiciones al destino solicitado bien</li>
    <li> The products are OK but was packaged in a ziplock type plastic bag. This was not what I expected since they were going to be used as.Christmas presents. The eyeliners in both packages I ordered did not turn or advance so if.you use it a few times and need to turn it to make the tip extend, it doesn&#x27;t. It makes it useless after just a few applications.</li>
    <li> I just received the products and I&#x27;m very happy. The eyeliner is one of the best out there and the lipstick&#x27;s color is just adorable.

    <li> me encantaron los cosm&amp;eacute;ticos y me parecieron mu practico para llevarlos en la cartera  excelente vendedor muy responsable  lo recomiendo!!!</li>
    <li> as so often we tend to forget the fact that everybody has different taste, skin type and skin color. I am a very fair skinned person, look best in blue based shades. So the lipstick does not look good, even with bronzer on it is too yellow based. The tinted moisturizer is nice. the lip gloss is pretty neutral, I like it. The little bottle of &amp;#34; repair wear&amp;#34; lotion reminded me that I already tried this product.......for me the product tends to get flaky as I apply make-up over it, my issue maybe, glad it was a sample. This Clinique eye shadow was pretty close to the colour I was looking for it suits my pale skin, the Lucky Penny shade has a little hint of pink to it, for me it compliments my skin colour. I am not a fan of brown shadow but the quality of the brown, Chocolate Chip shadow is very good, it stays on all day and unlike Urban Decay eye shadow it doesn&#x27;t drop of the applicator and ruin your already applied under eye concealer.</li>
    <li> This was an overpriced group of samples.  They seemed to be very old merchandise. I  Will not order these again.</li>
