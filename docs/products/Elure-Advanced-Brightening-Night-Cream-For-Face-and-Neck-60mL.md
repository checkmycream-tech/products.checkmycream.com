### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I used this product as directed and got beautiful whiting results.  </li>
      <li>I am happy and will order again.  </li>
      <li>I loved and approved it.  </li>
      <li>My skin got really good and moisturized.</li>
      <li>but my pigmentation faded dramatically, so I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>The smelling is just amazing.</li>
      <li>BUT THIS Product showed amazing results.</li>
      <li>Feels nice on skin but did nothing to reduce my melasma.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and smells really good.  </li>
      <li>After 7 months of Obagi and my skin not getting better and not being able to wean off the product, this cream is a MIRACLE!  </li>
      <li>so far (3 weeks of use) the product has been wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Its still there but very light.</li>
      <li>but at four weeks I noticed a difference and now, at eight weeks it looks even better.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Pigmentation had faded significantly .</li>
      <li>the whole top caved in.  </li>
      <li>also have Asian skin - and this is known to be effective for Asians.  </li>
      <li>bought for my sister and she loves, well worth the money</li>
      <li>It’s worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also possible that the rawness of my skin (from Obagi) made is more receptive to such quick change.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to be off the hydroquinone</li>
      <li>Okay... I&#x27;m not totally opposed to a two step item -</li>
      <li>The first one was purchased in Trinidad Wes Indies.</li>
      <li>Easy to understand and to apply,  Its the only cream that showed results for me.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like that this is a 2-step process.</li>
      <li>And I haven&#x27;t really seen any benefit.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very embarrassing.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s nice also not to have something so harsh on my skin.</li>
      <li>hydroquinone, Retin A and more ...but no change or slight brightness.</li>
      <li>I have ordered these twice to make sure I used them long enough to see if they worked as they said they would</li>
      <li>Better results than prescription medications I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>Think the product is old.</li>
      <li>Bought the facial wash and lightening lotion as part of whole system.  </li>
      <li>have sensitive skin and have had no irritation or breakouts with this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now using my old stuff from skinceuticals and see it reducing the melasma that was getting darker as i used the Elure.</li>
      <li>But so far I have seen results; my age &amp; acne spots appear to be fading.</li>
      <li>I doubt it will ever fade completely</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite surprised by the change in pigmentation .I&#x27;ve</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone from desperately trying to conceal the brown spots with multiple layers of concealers and makeup to using one light coat just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better than the many other face creams I have purchased in the past few years!</li>
      <li>I used up the entire jar and barely saw any improvement.  </li>

    <li> After 7 months of Obagi and my skin not getting better and not being able to wean off the product, this cream is a MIRACLE!  In two weeks it got rid of the remaining and very stubborn melasma and without the side effects of excessive peeling and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it did itch for a couple of days but I plowed through it and my skin acclimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have Asian skin - and this is known to be effective for Asians.  It&#x27;s also possible that the rawness of my skin (from Obagi) made is more receptive to such quick change.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to be off the hydroquinone and it&#x27;s nice also not to have something so harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> I was given the wrong item and I was never replace with the item desire!</li>
    <li> so far (3 weeks of use) the product has been wonderful.  It gives my face a lighter look and feel.  it&#x27;s better than the many other face creams I have purchased in the past few years!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Better results than prescription medications I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I have discoloration on my upper lip it&#x27;s very embarrassing. Tried this product religiously for 8 weeks now see very little difference pretty disappointing.  Very expensive for minimal results. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of the above product I purchased. The first one was purchased in Trinidad Wes Indies. This item gave me minimum results so I decided to extend the use by purchasing the other jar from Amazon.com. The product was damaged on arrival so I returned it for a refund.</li>
    <li> Expensive and not worth it. I have ordered these twice to make sure I used them long enough to see if they worked as they said they would Nope, nada, nothing.  Face was just oilier and that is about it</li>
    <li> Was unsure about this cream due to mixed reviews but decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s expensive for sure but my pigmentation faded dramatically, so I&#x27;m very pleased. I doubt it will ever fade completely but at four weeks I noticed a difference and now, at eight weeks it looks even better. I&#x27;ve gone from desperately trying to conceal the brown spots with multiple layers of concealers and makeup to using one light coat just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and have had no irritation or breakouts with this.</li>
    <li> The smelling is just amazing. My skin got really good and moisturized. I loved and approved it.  It’s worth it.</li>
    <li> bought for my sister and she loves, well worth the money</li>
    <li> Think the product is old. Smells super bad.</li>
    <li> big different in my skin, dark spots due to pempoles are all gone within two weeks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite surprised by the change in pigmentation .I&#x27;ve been treating sun spots and melasma on my checks for over ten years! I have Olive skin color, and I tried almost everything ... from Dermatologist to over the counter products. hydroquinone, Retin A and more ...but no change or slight brightness. BUT THIS Product showed amazing results. I use the cream a month now, at least five days a week, it is a two phase product. Easy to understand and to apply,  Its the only cream that showed results for me. Pigmentation had faded significantly . Its still there but very light. I Will continue using</li>
    <li> This product was one of several recommended by a panel of 4 dermatologists in a magazine article. I bought several of the items, including this product. After several weeks of use, I can&#x27;t see a lot of difference between this and other products that cost far less. I really don&#x27;t like that this is a 2-step process. The jar is divided into two wells; you apply cream from side 1, wait till it dries, then apply cream from side 2. Save your money and time!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product, so I&#x27;m still in the process of evaluating it. But so far I have seen results; my age &amp; acne spots appear to be fading. So I would recommend it to anyone who ha this problem.</li>
    <li> Works almost as well as Hydroquinone .</li>
    <li> After all the hype about this product,decided to try it,BAD IDEA.NEVER had acne problems,got terrible breakout on face on second day.stopped and rash almost gone.half star.definitely unsatisfied.can&#x27;t even return.will stay with macy&#x27;s at least you can exchange or return.paid too much.</li>
    <li> Feels nice on skin but did nothing to reduce my melasma.  Bought the facial wash and lightening lotion as part of whole system.  Did nothing to lighten my melasma.  Maybe it works on hyperpigmentation that is not too bad, but nothing for my melasma.  Waste of money.  I&#x27;m now using my old stuff from skinceuticals and see it reducing the melasma that was getting darker as i used the Elure.</li>
    <li> I have used two jars of this product.  I have a lot of sun damage from being outside a lot so with each jar my skin has improved - brown spots and mottling reduced with no irritation.  I will use it again.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed and got beautiful whiting results.  It is easy to apply and smells really good.  I saw this product on the TODAY show and it was recommended by the host.  I am happy and will order again.  The cream was well packaged and arrived on time!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help with my dark spots... I expected to see a difference but it was just like any other cream</li>
    <li> Okay... I&#x27;m not totally opposed to a two step item - in fact, the lightening lotion is a two step product - but the packaging is terrible!  there are two compartments with a snap in applicator stick. To lift the side there is a tiny flap which is nearly impossible to lift, and when I tried to snap the applicator stick back in it&#x27;s slot the whole top caved in.  It&#x27;s a mess to use.  And I haven&#x27;t really seen any benefit.  I will continue to use it, but probably will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Box is not sealed and it was less than 50mL</li>
    <li> I used up the entire jar and barely saw any improvement.  It was just a waste of money. It also made me breakout which has never happened with any other products.</li>
