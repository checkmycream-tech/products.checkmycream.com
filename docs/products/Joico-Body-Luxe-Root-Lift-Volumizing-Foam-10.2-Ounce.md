    <li> I am thrilled that I can find my favorite hair products on Amazon and I don&#x27;t have to waste my time and gas to go and get it from the local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> best hair product for thin hair. Add body without build up</li>
    <li> My favourite hair volunteer.</li>
    <li> I rate this product superior for giving lasting body to fine hair.  I have tried many other mousses and gels and have found this one to be the best for long lasting body. I even use it as a mousse all over my hair, not just on the roots.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this!  I will never be without it!</li>
    <li> I put this on my wet hair and could hardly get a brush through it.I had conditioned my hair so it was this product that caused it. It made my hair look really dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this product.  Joico has changed the formula and I like this one much better.  I can only buy it online and hope you will continue to carry this as long as the supply lasts.  I would recommend this to everyone wanting good volume that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add I like the older version of Joico Jowhip also.  It gives my hair the extra strength I need.  Can I find this on Amazon also?</li>
    <li> This product worked very well if I would put the root lifter on my hair and then turn my hear upside down and dry it.  It worked much better than any of the other products that I have tried that claimed they work to give the crown of my hair some &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for thin fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff, sticky, or crunchy. Leaves hair feeling noticeably thicker.</li>
    <li> Very good!  Nice body ...doesn&#x27;t weight hair down or make it look greasy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and adds tons of volume.  I love the sprayable bottle.</li>
    <li> I tried it and it made my hair sticky. I tried to return it and I was told I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best for my fine thin hair.  Throw in humidity and ugh.  Joico rules</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d try this as I have very fine hair. I feel that it didn&#x27;t live up to the reviews and after at least 10 cans of different volumnizers I found a different one I like a lot better.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work as I expected for volume and made my hair sticky</li>
    <li> I bought a can of this and ran out of it. I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores in hillbilly home area. So looked at Amazon and ordered 2 to stock up on. Can&#x27;t wait to get them. It works great on my fine hair to style. Since running out 2 weeks ago I sure have missed having it.</li>
    <li> the lid was missing when I received it and it smells like coconuts</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I use it every day and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Hard to find but worth it.  Great root lift for fine hair.  Buy it!  You will be pleased :)  I promise</li>
    <li> Great, I use it all the time. Since I need volume it gives! Has a nice smell and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Gives body, but hair gets sticky. I recommend to try &amp;#34;Living proof 5 in 1&amp;#34; instead. Read my review on that product also. That is the only one I found so far, that really works for giving body, making hair look healthy and blocks humidity.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL!!!!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My favorite root colonizer. My hair looks smooth, has nice body and is shiny. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find the Joico Root Lift.  It was discontinued and I love how it adds volume to my hair.  Product was delivered quickly and damage free.  Thank you!</li>
