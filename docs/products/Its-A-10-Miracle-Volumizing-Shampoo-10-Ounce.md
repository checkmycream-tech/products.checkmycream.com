<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product has great reviews so I gave it a try but found it to be ho-hum. I have fine hair but do have a lot of it so I&#x27;m looking for something that won&#x27;t weigh my hair down and give it a boost so it isn&#x27;t limp. I&#x27;ve tried many different volumizing products but am still looking for a shampoo that actually works and volumizes. This isn&#x27;t it. It certainly doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but it doesn&#x27;t do much else to it either. I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference after using this shampoo. I&#x27;m glad others have liked it but I won&#x27;t be buying it again...the search continues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pureology&#x27;s volume shampoo seems to be the best I&#x27;ve tried so far but it&#x27;s price is making me keep looking. Also, I have found that for styling products, the Oribe Gradiose Mousse is by far the BEST product I have ever used for giving my hair volume AND thickness. It is expensive but has lasted me many months and is so worth it.</li>
    <li> Easy-to-use pump delivers a little blob with lots of lather. If you have fine hair this is the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; you have been looking for. Add a dab of volumizing mousse and hair is manageable regardless of damp or windy weather.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s completely changed my hair - with this plus conditioner (I switch around, but usually use the it&#x27;s a 10 conditioning mask on all but the top 2-3&amp;#34; on my hair) my fine, thin hair looks shiny, but feels voluminous rather than Gwyneth Paltrow-flat - a look the round-faced and fine, straight-haired don&#x27;t love. The first few times I couldn&#x27;t stop shaking my head back and forth to feel my hair move. It wasn&#x27;t Dallas-big, but it was natural-volume big. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair and don&#x27;t usually use any hair product other than the occasional Moroccan oil on the ends and this was fantastic without anything else...BUT...the it&#x27;s a 10 volumizer is great for a night out. Just use it SPARINGLY - you can always add more once your hair is dry and it does give you build up you can feel when you run your hands through your hair, even if you can&#x27;t see it. The volumizer also cuts down on shine a little near the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly though, I am emphatically not a &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; person. My hair is fine, thin and in great condition, but I&#x27;ve always had to wash it every single day - on day two, it&#x27;s absolutely impossible to wear it down and it even looks flat in a ponytail. I started using Pssst every other day and had some (limited) success with second-day hair that wasn&#x27;t put up. This though. Once I tried this, with the mask, something changed and my hair can now go three, yes three, days without shampooing and look just fine with a little Pssst at the roots. I don&#x27;t blow dry or curl or straighten my hair, and I still shower, so I don&#x27;t save any time getting ready, but the condition of my hair has improved dramatically and the less I wash it, the thicker and healthier it looks, regardless of which shampoo I use. That said, when I switch back to another shampoo or conditioner, I only get two days of good hair rather than the 3-4 I can get with It&#x27;s a 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually the shampoo I&#x27;ve been searching for for 20+ years. It&#x27;s life-changing. And yes, Irealize how that sounds. (P.S. Using the It&#x27;s a 10 volumizer does knock a day or two off the life of my shampoo, but it&#x27;s worth it for a night out - just remember to use it sparingly. You can always add more.)</li>
    <li> Great product if you need to &amp;#34;pump up the volume&amp;#34;! Gives hair more fullness and volume, and at a great price. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair, love it</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes my hair so soft and manageable. I also use the shampoo and conditioner. I am a 57 year old woman with long hair and it makes it look beautiful!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It makes my hair feel so clean and full of body. Great Shampoo!!</li>
    <li> In the past month I have tried at least 6 different shampoos and conditioners both store bought and professional. I&#x27;ve used their original product but found that my hair is too fine for all the moisture. I have fine hair and a lot of it. I never leave reviews but I had to for this product because I&#x27;m in love. I used this product with the lite spray conditioner and blow dry spray and left my hair air dry. Within 39 minutes I had more volume and lift than I did when using other products and spending hours styling and fooling with my hair. This is well worth the price - if you have fine or limp hair you must try this.</li>
    <li> I see it did great for a lot of people, but not for me. I had really high hopes too. I have thin hair that fell out in clumps after the death of my hisband. I wear extensions now for that reason, but I can&#x27;t wear them on the top of my head. So I need something to give my hair volume up there. This shampoo didn&#x27;t deliver. It had the opposite effect. My hair looked limp and greasy. It is still sitting in my shower. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it on the kids.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and has no natural volume. I love It&#x27;s A 10 products, but this is my favorite. Adds great volume, not greasy or dry, smells great too.</li>
    <li> Great Product  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t work in giving volume. It left my hair flat. It did make my hair and scalp feel clean (no residue feeling that some other shampoos leave). I love the fact that it lathered up a lot with no sulfates. I like the shampoo to a degree but can&#x27;t justify spending $21 for average results (I bought it at a beauty discount supply store, apparently based on amazon prices, I didn&#x27;t get a discount).  Im going to return this and think about trying biolage volume shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great product! Don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo two or three times, where it performed as advertised. Then, it seemed not to clean hair so well. So now, with the pump, I&#x27;m using it as a shave cream for shaving my legs. Works great for that.</li>
    <li> great product for my hair!!</li>
    <li> Works great does not weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> excellent for fine hair. hard to find in local stores</li>
    <li> Great product for people who have thin hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works wonderful.  I have thin fine hair. My hair has volume to it after every wssh</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very fine limp hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. The light leave in conditioner is great with it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Leaves my thin and flat hair feeling thicker, shiny and soft!! Best shampoo I have found so far for my very fine hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It is a Miracle - my hair has so much volume after shampooing.</li>
    <li> I love that this shampoo is sulfate-free.  I have really long, flat hair and it definitely helps give it volume.  Smells nice!</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;s a 10 shampoo helped to add volume to my hair.  I use a Bedhead gel volumizer and then blow out.  Looks quite good, since I have thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;More gentle than Bedhead volumizer shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was reading about John Edwards, you know, the disgraced politician who still has&lt;br /&gt;delusions of grandeur (my nudge at him!) and how he is so vain he orders, from Malaysia, by the casefull, this special volumizing shampoo for his hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now I had noticed the guy has nice hair (remember his $400 haircuts and how he primped on Youtube, tousling his hair just so? lol) so I wanted to get something comparable in the states because, I am not a multimillionaire who can order casefulls of shampoo from Malaysia.&lt;br /&gt;I did a bit of research, both online and with my stylist and she recommended this new product.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff does exactly what it says. My hair has volume without putting any, or too much, product in it. Lathers up fine with one pump, doesn&#x27;t affect color, has no scent that I can detect, it sure is a 10.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a sulfate free, volumizing shampoo.</li>
    <li> Much prefer the volumizing shampoo by it&#x27;s a 10 over the moisturizing shampoo. Use it!</li>
    <li> Love this... It keeps my very fine and old hair looking very full. I would recommend it to anyone with fine hair that tends to droop.</li>
    <li> I am a 53 year old female with very long hair and it is highlighted blonde.  I have very thin, fine hair and I have tried numerous products that will not only soften my hair but keep it healthy and not weighed down.  This product hits the mark!!!  I would recommend this to anyone that is simply fed up with over the counter promises!!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many shampoos , I feel like a tester sometimes.  This is the first shampoo that actually does what it claims to do. I just wish it was easier to find locally.</li>
    <li> This is is the best shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> Works real well if you like volume on your hair. It does other healthy things to your hair as well and that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
    <li> I love the It&#x27;s a 10 line. This formula cleans well without stripping the hair of every drop of moisture.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Seems to help with my thin hair.</li>
    <li> Is OK but nothing special</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo! Especially considering the great price. Made my hair feel thicker.</li>
    <li> Very much like this shampoo.  The smell is light and really cleans the scalp.  The leave-in conditioner was too light for my hair and bought the conditioner with keratin, which works well for me.  Virtually no frizz in high humidity and my hair looks and feels soft and shiny without additional product.</li>
    <li> Product as described fast shipping</li>
    <li> This lite version is fantastic.  The regular is not. Lasts forever as it doesn&#x27;t take much-one pump for short hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it received great reviews from almost everyone, but it didn&#x27;t work for me, and that&#x27;s okay, everyone&#x27;s different.  I&#x27;m returning it.  If you have dry, course hair, I think this would be great, but I have thicker, fine hair, and it just weighed it down instead of giving it volume, even after using a volumizing spray for styling.</li>
    <li> I put my hair through ALOT.... daily curling irons, blow drying, highlights.... you name it and have tried everything to keep it healthy! What i lovr most about this product is it is a protective agent and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all.  I use it on me and my 5 year old (we both have hair to our waists) and it is worth every dime!!! Love this stuff and its much cheaper on Amazon than in salons!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because it is SLS free. The other reviews lead me to believe that it was a gentle shampoo that did not have many bubbles. This was so far from what I found to be true. I have highlighted hair and after using this my hair felt dry and straw like. The scent is strong and unpleasant. I would not recommend this shampoo or the conditioner to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, very thin hair with salon-added highlights so I wanted a color-safe shampoo that would give me extra volume.  It does make my hair feel very clean, but it also tends to make it a frizzy, tangled mess if I don&#x27;t use conditioner (I tried what that other reviewer said, using just the shampoo and then the miracle leave-in but um...never doing that again).  On the bright side, I guess it does give me SOME extra volume but it also tends to make my hair...fluffy?  I guess is the word.  Not really sleek, just...kinda fluffy.  I&#x27;m not really sure how I feel about it, but since I paid so much for it I&#x27;d feel guilty about not finishing the bottle.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo!  It makes my hair silky and shiny!  My husband likes it as well!&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it for any type of hair.</li>
    <li> Okay for some, perhaps, but not for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried many salon shampoo products and this is my favorite. It is So much better than the moisturizing shampoo.</li>
    <li> does not do what it promises</li>
    <li> Great product.  A little goes a long way.  Hair feels clean and fuller. Although a little pricey, well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased the shampoo because I was buying the AWESOME leave in conditioner.  Very happy and will purchase both again.</li>
    <li> First:  Congratulations to whoever named the product line.  It comes up when you search for best shampoos and is an advertisers dream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used once and the difference is very noticeable.  Hair has more body.</li>
    <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t do what it says.  Miracle Volumizing.  I don&#x27;t see it yet.  I actually get more volume from cheap grocery store shampoo.</li>
    <li> Adds volume, good product.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. It did not add volume, it just made it unmanageable.  I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the difference this shampoo made in the way my hair felt. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This really works!  I was skeptical but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It does add body to my hair and it is very manageable.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used tons of volumizing shampoos. This one is ok but I probably wouldn&#x27;t get it again. Smells great though</li>
    <li> Works as claimed. Love the easy start. Fairly easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Cover fits well. Only improvement that I would like to see is a wide hook&lt;br /&gt;to hang the grill on when it is removed while tending fire.&lt;br /&gt;FYI the grill did arrive with a LOT of parts that had to get&lt;br /&gt;put together. My husband had it done in 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;You have to have skills to complete.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else. &amp;#34;The It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; is a great product. Amazon needs too many words for this review</li>
    <li> My hair never did &amp;#34;grow up&amp;#34;and it is as fine as a baby&#x27;s,plus,now that I am 71 years old I have lost some of it.When I use the Its A10 my hair now feels like it has some substance to it,and I feel a lot better about it.</li>
    <li> The pump was broke.  I like the product but it is difficult to use in the shower with a broken pump.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great !  smells so good  and gives my hair some volume, makes my hair feel nice and clean. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a week, and have not noticed any results! Still have fine, limp hair!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing.</li>
    <li> This produce is actually an 11!  My 68-year old hair has never been better.  I actually look forward to washing my hair….I don&#x27;t have to fight my hair anymore.  Body, shine and bounce - you get it all!</li>
    <li> Good product. Happy with my purchase. Would recommend. I feel if I want to write a review on here, I should be able to have as many or as little verbiage as I want.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with products that work on my fine, thin hair and don&#x27;t irritate my scalp.  I bought this on a whim and LOVED it.  Not only does it give my hair a cleaner, fresher feeling, but it also stopped me from getting any of the dry, frizzy texture I used to get from other shampoos and any scalp itch I used to have to deal with is completely gone.  I will never go back to any of my old stand-by brands as long as they keep making this shampoo.  And I&#x27;ve used the Miracle leave in treatment lite, the light blow dry volumizer, and the regular conditioner and my hair has never been better!</li>
    <li> light foaming, gentle cleanser&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t forget to use leave in spray conditioner afterward</li>
    <li> It does the volumizing job but it&#x27;s not worth it because it gives me greasier hair and dry ends. It doesn&#x27;t protect colored hair either.. I got my hair dyed recently and this stripped away the hair color. I paid $117 for nothing! It&#x27;s making me so frustrated. When I used to use the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Shampoo Plus Keratin, it was perfect. I&#x27;ll be going back to t&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Shampoo Plus Keratin!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks and it works great.  It lathers up nicely and rinses out clean with no residue.  When used with miracle 10 silk conditioner I find it is the perfect combo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with every product I have purchased from this brand. This shampoo adds shine and volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> Product is not worth the money - only one in the line that I have come across that I do not like!</li>
    <li> So, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try my new shampoo. I am a bit of a shampoo hoarder, and like to try all the new brands when they come out. So, I&#x27;ve tried many, many, many volumizing shampoos in the past, but this by far is the best I&#x27;ve found. It smells amazing, rinses clean, and it volumizes like nobody&#x27;s business!!! I have color-treated fine hair (but A LOT of it), and it gets tangled really easily and its medium length and usually tough to get body unless I use a ton of products (mousse, spray, etc) and the humidity here in TX doesn&#x27;t help any. But I just shampooed with this, used the daily conditioner of the same line, and didn&#x27;t use any other product. My comb went right through my hair with no issues and I have volume that&#x27;s lasted through Late July Texas humidity/heat, and its so bouncy. I am in love. I will use this at least once a week for sure. Get it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Was told to try this shampoo and let me tell you, I love it.  Makes my hair feel really clean and I have more volume than I have ever had.  Great price as well.</li>
    <li> This is undoubtedly the best shampoo I have ever used. It is both a volumizer and doesn&#x27;t dry out or weigh down my hair--which is a rarity in shampoos. Pleasant fragrance, appearance and texture as well. Entirely worth the investment and I will definitely purchase this regularly through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it claims.  When I tried to send back, the distributor claimed that I needed to contact the manufacturer.  The problem is, there is no way to contact the manufacturer....their website does not allow for it!</li>
    <li> I got the real product from a salon. This is not thick and rich like the other shampoo I have. It is not the real product. Do not buy online because it is rare to get the real product.</li>
    <li> like shampoo what was left of it most waste in shipping but would buy again</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for blondes, smells awesome and each time I use it my hair feels smoother but still has volume...</li>
    <li> A favorite product of mine that&#x27;s not readily available locally.</li>
    <li> this shampoo was recommended to me by my hairdresser, omg. it has changed my life,&lt;br /&gt;for one, my hair has been thinning from age and menopause. awful.&lt;br /&gt;my hair was limp, and lifeless. this product cleans my hair without drying it out. then i spritz it with the lite&lt;br /&gt;leave on conditioner ( yes get the 10 lite leave on conditioner spray) and i blow dry my hair, it is full&lt;br /&gt;of life and bounce.  alot of people ask me what i use on my hair because it is so shiny and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;so i highly recommendl i have bought the product for my husband too who is over 70 and has thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;i think hes going to love it.</li>
    <li> It had the potential to be a terrific oroduct but, unfortunately, the added &amp;#34;moistness&amp;#34; makes the end result somewhat limp and soggy.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> This shampoo actually left my hair limp and with no body at all.  I purchased it along with the leave in conditioner.  After 2 days of use, I went back to my regular shampoo.  Nexus Humectress.  It just did not give me ANY body at all.</li>
    <li> Thanks you! Received immediately.</li>
    <li> I have fine, flat hair.  This shampoo made my hair feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> really good but would like more shine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not blown away by this product. Especially based on the lofty claims on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Moisture Shampoo and along with their Miracle Leave-In Product and they have worked just fine for my color treated hair.  Now, I also use Kenra and Fekkai hair products for color-treated shampoo/conditioners (on alternate days), but use the Leave-In Product on a daily basis (it&#x27;s a must). :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I heard that It&#x27;s A 10 was coming out with this new Volumizing Sulfate Free line I was really excited to get ahold of the shampoo to try it out.  With their product line I have found that I don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner on a daily basis I can use their shampoo, and the Leave-In Product and I&#x27;m \\&quot;good to go\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that I was able to order the Volumizing shampoo from Amazon for several $$ cheaper than through the Salon/store pricing. : )(thanks Amazon)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my hair is fine, and I color treat it on my own at home ~ I like Sulfate-Free shampoo&#x27;s/conditioners because they keep your hair healthier, and hold on to a \\&quot;hair color\\&quot; longer, and maintain that \\&quot;color vibrancy\\&quot; and make it look so much nicer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Volumizing Shampoo I have really noticed a difference out of the other Sulfate Free shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  This shampoo does give the \\&quot;volume\\&quot; it is intended to do.  It also makes makes my hair feel, nice and clean and light and bouncy.  Oh, and on the \\&quot;off days\\&quot; that you don&#x27;t shampoo your hair, your hair will still feel nice and clean!  When styling after shampooing I use just a few products and I like the \\&quot;light\\&quot; feeling I had, yet knowing I was getting the volume I wanted and needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use more than even \\&quot;one pump\\&quot; of the shampoo from the bottle.  It lathers up really well and rinses out great.  The smell is really nice.  I have heard some people say that they don&#x27;t think they get a good lather out of their shampoos so they end up using too much shampoo when all they have to do is just rinse in a little water to lather up the shampoo to make it more sudsy for them.  This is definitely not a need with this shampoo!  I also noticed that with some shampoo&#x27;s my hair tends to feel \\&quot;brittle\\&quot; or \\&quot;snappy\\&quot; after shampooing, with this one, it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Volumizing Line they sell the Miracle Leave-In Lite Product to be used in conjunction.  I want to purchase and try that out, but I have a fairly new bottle of the Miracle Leave-In Product to finish.  I have been using it with the Volumizing shampoo and it&#x27;s works out just great.  So, if anyone is questioning if you can use them both together, yes you can! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When searching for a new shampoo or conditioner it can be overwhelming as there are so many products out there.  I would definitely recommend this one for anyone that wants a shampoo to use for volumizing, sulfate-free, a color-protectant, and shampoo that won&#x27;t make your hair feel limp or weighted down after shampooing (or that snappy/brittle feeling I described above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****Stars for a great hair product! :)sudsy for them.  This is definitely not a need with this shampoo!  I also noticed that with some shampoo&#x27;s my hair tends to feel \\&quot;brittle\\&quot; or \\&quot;snappy\\&quot; after shampooing, with this one, it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Volumizing Line they sell the Miracle Leave-In Lite Product to be used in conjunction.

    <li> Great shampoo for thin hair. Also use the light leave in spray conditioner as others are too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Surprise.  After trying several shampoos for my thin wispy hair, I tried this one,not expecting much.  I love it!!  It gives my hair body and texture, as well as shine.  I also used the leave-in spray, which I never do, but this one just added to the volume and body.  I am very pleased with these products.  (Too bad, Dove Volume Therapy--I can&#x27;t find you anywhere.)  This works just as wll, if not better.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo that has given me body and fullness. Love it, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product!!!!  I have fine, thin hair and use this combined with the leave in lite spray..MAGIC!</li>
    <li> Nice smell and it works great for my baby fine hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  My hair color hardly faded and felt wonderful.  I used the leave-in conditioner (It&#x27;s a 10 Silk Express) in the purple bottle with this and loved the combo!</li>
    <li> Based on the price and the reviews, I expected something better.&lt;br /&gt;It was a good shampoo but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my hair. No volume and felt like it tangled my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Still 3 stars because it still a good shampoo, just didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.</li>
    <li> Daughter told me about this shampoo, and used with other Its a 10 products, works great! Bought some of the other products here too.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, I have oily, thin fine hair and this is wonderful for my hair! I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, BUT KEEP IN MIND, IT WILL MAKE YOUR HAIR GREASY..ONLY USE SMALL AMOUNTS &amp; NO, DON&#x27;T EXPECTS A  SUDSY SHAMPOO~</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin, oily hair and this shampoo is absolutely amazing for me. I&#x27;ll probably never try another shampoo after finding this! I don&#x27;t use regular conditioner afterwards, just the Lite Leave in Conditioner to combat static and this has truly been a winning combo.</li>
    <li> I use many \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; products and I love them! I have fine, color treated hair and I thought it would be nice to add a little more volume to my &#x27;do,&#x27; so I purchased \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Volumizing Shampoo\\&quot; from Amazon and it only earned the one star because it smells SO GOOD, other than that... Well, it just sucks. I&#x27;m not sure if I was ripped off by the Amazon seller or if this is just how the product works since it was my first time using it. It did not lather in my hair, left it dry and totally unmanageable. I will not be purchasing it again, however I still use \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; conditioning treatments and leave-in sprays.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for thin hair.  Pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!! I would definitely recommend it and their entire line because its all I use now!</li>
    <li> Am loving this shampoo</li>
    <li> I have to say that my hair was very dry after using this product. I didn&#x27;t buy a conditioner with the same brand, but I did buy the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave in Lite and that helped to work out some of the tangles when I was styling my hair. I do believe it did add a little volume to my hair and it feels clean after each shampoo. I use a conditioner that I already own, but it still leaves it feeling like straw.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, DOES WHAT IT SAYS.</li>
    <li> I first bought this shampoo in a salon and, finding it less expensive on Amazon, have ordered it here ever since. It&#x27;s the best shampoo ever and you only need a small amount to get a great effect - it seems expensive but it lasts for months!</li>
    <li> 4 months after the birth of my son, my hair started falling out like crazy. I needed a shampoo that would keep it looking full, when it definitely wasn&#x27;t. This shampoo has been absolutely fantastic. Cleans, volumizes without weighing my hair down, and smells great. I&#x27;d absolutely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  I also have the conditioner hair mask &amp; spray on conditioner...they&#x27;re all great. The shampoo made a huge difference to my fine hair...added some volume and it&#x27;s super soft! Love!</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;m never going back to anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this. My hair is thinning some and I have been trying many other volumizing  shampoos like Aveda and on line expensie ones that promise volume. This is by far the best I have tried and it&#x60;s the least expensive!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Say goodbye to that flat lifeless hair, used with right mousse or texturizer this shampoo is where you should start. You only need a tiny squirt for the richest lather you can imagine. I use Chazez flocker but when its gone may try more of this line. I started with the shampoo and have been sick. My hair has been let for for a week and this product is a miracle. When your hair looks good I swear you feel better. I was skeptical and am now sold on this shampoo. Best prices here too. Free shipping.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  My hair curls beautifully (a minor miracle) and has body after 2 days!  Love this so much.  I alternate it with the Keratin added variety.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipment</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, I dont see myself buying a different brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using this with the Miracle Leave-In LITE and am NOT happy with the results.  I had a Brazilian Blowout, and this product practically reversed it and has made my hair course and dry.  Would NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> Great cleansing shampoo for colored hair.  No sulfates.  Wonderful fresh scent.  I like the pump bottle, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I am disappointed, the price seems to be going up every time I order &#x27;It&#x27;s A 10&#x27;.  Ridiculous.  Just switched to Neutrogena Clean Volume shampoo.  Very happy and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shampoo I have ever used!  It is my must have along with the leave in conditioner~lite~.  My hair is super straight and fine, though I have a lot of hair.  Most supposedly volumizing shampoos do nothing for my hair, but my 10 leaves it super soft, shiny, and full and lively!  I simply wash my hair, spray the leave-in conditioner on my finger tips, apply,  and style.  My hair is cut in an inverted very short bob so now I can just let it air dry!  Any It&#x27;s a 10 product I have used is great!  But this one hits a home run for me!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this works great without drying out your hair.  It is a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;  I recommend highly.  Terri</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 years now and all I have to say is THANKS I FOUND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It cleans my hair with just a small amount of shampoo, and, when used in conjunction with the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; conditioner, leaves my hair manageable and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I have very long hair. This made my hair full and feel amazing. I would highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo to anyone who wants full hair.</li>
    <li> Love this miracle stuff! I have short, thin hair and this give me a ton of volume and movement for my little strands of hair. I only use it once maybe twice a week, mainly when I have somewhere important to be when I need my hair on it&#x27;s A game.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has allowed me to&amp;#34; wash and go&amp;#34; my hair.  I am a senior with difficulty keeping my arms up to style my hair.  Now I wash it and let it dry on its own after combing it into the way I want it to look.  My hair &amp;#34;fluffs&amp;#34; on it&#x27;s own, is shiny and healthy looking.  I highly recommend it to people with thin, lanky hair</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product.  Since I started using the it, my hair started looking healthier and fuller and I receive complements on a daily basis.  I recommended the product to several of my friends and family members and they have expressed their satisfaction as well.</li>
    <li> I am a self-proclaimed hair products whore and I&#x27;ve been hooked on the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; line for more than a year and absolutely LOVE IT!  I mix it up a little with the regular, and volumizing shampoos and also use the leave-in conditioner and blow dry volumizer.  I was one of those women who was rarely, if ever, happy with my hair and now I feel like bad-hair days are the exception now, rather than the rule.</li>
    <li> My hair is one of those types that is hard to please.  So many shampoos weigh it down, make it oily, make it stringy, make it frizzy...  This is the only one I have found that does MIRACLES to my hair.  Everything it says it does, IT DOES.  Takes 3 squirts &amp; that is it.  My hair is fuller, bouncier, &amp; just looks healthier all around!  Will keep coming back!</li>
    <li> Love &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; products.  This product definitely gives more volume to my fine, straight, flat hair.</li>
    <li> This product Really volumizes my fine, straight hair.  Convenient to pack size.  It was Recommended by my hairdresser.  This word requirement is really annoying!</li>
    <li> I always wait to write my reviews b/c I like to use the product for a period of time before I comment, who wants a review before its time right?  I bought this product solely based off of the glowing reviews.  I have fine hair w/ some wavy but not enough to let it air dry or brag about, and I highlight it too.  I have used Pureology (volumne for color treated hair), Biolage, Aveda and none I liked.  I like Pureology up until they changed the formula and then it was too heavy and my hair, well, just didn&#x27;t feel like hair.  I have used this product for over a week and my hair feels like hair- finally, and it has volume without feeling coated.  It must be the keratin in it..I have heard keratin is good for your hair...anyway, I absolutely love the product and would highly recommend it.  I also use the 10 (leave in conditioner, dark blue bottle with orange print) and love that too.  When I say my hair feels like hair, I mean it moves like it use to before I started highlighting it vs. looking and feeling dry and stiff.  The 10 (leave in conditioner) is perfect b/c it isn&#x27;t at all heavy or leaves a residue..it is llight, and youo don&#x27;t need to spray on much, just a couple puffs and work it in....Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m in love again. After seeing so many reviews I was really looking forward to use It&#x27;s a 10 products. I started with the shampoo it really does take one pump cleans and rinsed out very well. I would have NEVER  used a leaven in (lite) conditioner my hair it&#x27;s silver and fine. Was I surprised as I dried my hair it started fluffing up and became very soft. When my hair was almost dry I sprayed it with voluminous  drying spray. (I think that is the name) I can&#x27;t remember when my hair felt so clean soft and bouncy. I have always deal with oily hair and this makes my hair really look like a nice hair style. Being SLS FREE IS A PLUS.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very good, ideal for fine hair, makes it very soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> LOVE,LOVE,LOVE THIS PRODUCT. INTRODUCED TO IT BY A HAIRDRESSER I ONCE USED BECAUSE OF HEALTH ISSUES I WAS HAVING.  THIS SHAMPOO AND THE LEAVE IN SILK CONDITIONER COMPLETLY TURNED MY PROBLEMS AROUND.  I LIVE IN A RURAL AREA AND AMAZON IS AN ABSOLUTE BLESSING. WITH PRIME, IN MOST CASES ORDER TODAY AND RECEIVE IT TOMORROW.  OCCASIONALLY A WAIT, BUT NOT OFTEN.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT WHETHER HEALTH PROBLEMS WERE A FACTOR OR NOT.  THANK YOU FOR ASKING.</li>
    <li> Perfect for older thinning and color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for.  Unfortunately this product does not work as advertised for my fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> Gives volumes to my limp hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a year now and love it!  I have fine straight hair and nothing compares to this wonderful shampoo!  My hair is fuller, healthier and shinier than ever before.  I was having hair loss as well and this took care of that.  It lives up to the name and, although pricy, is well worth it. A very small amount is all that is needed and it lasts a very long time.  It really is &amp;#34;A 10&amp;#34; for making my flat straight hair as good as it can be.</li>
    <li> This is a good clarifying shampoo, it really cleans well and gets all the gunk out. But, it also strips color out (like clarifying shampoos tend to do). Great if you have that purpose in mind (I used this to strip color a lot before when I used to change my color like every 2 weeks). I don&#x27;t know how well it volumizes since the way I style my hair gets it voluminous inof itself, but it definitely does NOT weigh down your hair at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for dry hair or for daily use, though.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I will repurchase in the future, when I need a good clarifying shampoo. Right now I want to keep my hair color.</li>
    <li> 10 Miracle Volumizing Shampoo is a favorite of mine. I have used this product for about one year. The shampoo has a light fragrance. Also, with the dispenser pump there is no waste in obtaining the desired amount. 10 Miracle leaves my hair easy to manage. The product was recommended by my hairdresser!!  I would recommend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> but it seems to do the job. My hair is thick and fine, and this helps maintain body. Need some conditioner with it, otherwise my hair is very tangled and difficult to comb out.</li>
    <li> Very nice for volumizing and healthy looking hair&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shampoos I have used.  It is gentle on the hair and does not make it dry.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, great product!</li>
    <li> Best volumizing shampoo I have ever used....</li>
    <li> voy a continuar usandolo, me deja el pelo mas manejable en conjunto con el 10 miracle deep conditioner mi pelo luce radiante.</li>
    <li> I have used other 10 Miracle products and loved them, but for some reason the volumizing shampoo didn&#x27;t work for me.  It left my hair flat - and I had to put a lot of other products in my hair to get it to do something for me...A friend recommended the shampoo, it worked for her.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Shipped right away.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing more than regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> this is a fine shampoo, but I find with volumizing, it&#x27;s more in the conditioner.  I mean, it&#x27;s not a bad product, it doesn&#x27;t flatten my hair but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a whole lot a volumizing going on either.  So, for being on the pricier side, I think I  will go with a less expensive conditioner but I do love their unisex mousse for volume!!</li>
    <li> Foams up nicely for a no-poo shampoo.</li>
    <li> If possible purchase at a store to try out before just ordering it.  My sister loves it so she had recommended it but I think its just okay.  Probably would of not bought it if I was able to test it out first by purchasing from a store.  I&#x27;d recommend Cat Walk Volume shampoo over this.  Seemed to really give volume but felt like it dried it out.  Not very moisturizing at all.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good on fragile, thin or colored hair.  It&#x27;s not something I would use everyday because it might be a little too drying but it&#x27;s great when I use it about every 3rd wash.  It&#x27;s also cheap.  I use high quality/salon expensive products most of the time.  I do like to use this sometimes though because the expensive salon products sometimes start weighing my hair down and so using this from time to time kind of lifts the hair back up.</li>
    <li> While I’m pleased it is sulfate free and supposedly gentle on hair, it does absolutely nothing for me in regards to volume. Within hours it falls flat and lifeless as usual. I have very fine, thin, hair that leans on the oily side – which means I have to wash it every other day and or use dry shampoo to prolong between washes. I’ve tried several brands of “volumizing” shampoos, conditioners, and styling products, only to be disappointed. If you can find this in a travel size or can try a squeeze from a friend’s bottle, I would do that before buying this. I tried the original version a few years ago, and again, while seemingly nice, it didn’t do much for me either. I was excited when I stumbled across the lite version. Yet, it&#x27;s not any better volume-wise than some of it&#x27;s cheaper drugstore counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s the good in having healthy, nourished hair if it sticks to my scalp – limp and lifeless?!!! I’m still oily and flat. Not sure to do with my leftovers. I guess it’ll end up as yet another cast off in my guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Used other Its a 10 products such as Leave In Conditioner and this makes a perfect companion.  Cleanses gently and efficiently with rich lather.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair easy to manage and gives it volume. Looks great after I blow dry. A little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I really like the way my hair looks when I use this--I have oily hair and my hair gets oily by the end of the evening when I shampoo in the morning. I think for most people this will be great--I have the same issue with Wen (only much worse with Wen)--I LOVE the product but it is not right for my oily hair. If you do not have oily hair, but you have fine hair and want body and shiny, healthy-looking hair, then I would recommend this.</li>
