### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product, excellent price.</li>
      <li>It was shipped in a bubble envelope which was great</li>
      <li>However, this eye cream is nothing great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to feel this even in the morning!</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and I would purchase again.  </li>
      <li>This is a pleasantly moisturizing, creamy petrolatum-type product that is also fairly inexpensive for its type.</li>
      <li>Now I found it separate &amp; a good price.</li>
      <li>good price.</li>
      <li>The smell is also very light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>great eye cream and great for touch ups throughout the day when your eyes get dry</li>
      <li>I love Olay products anyways.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love Olay products.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Will continue to look for a better product.</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>More of a gel than a cream</li>
      <li>Has a nice light application.</li>
      <li>But I love this eye cream and it works.</li>
      <li>Love it for the reason it is in a TUBE, easy to put on....</li>
      <li>I received the product very quickly.</li>
      <li>However, the tube was fine and not leaking.  </li>
      <li>The seller shipped it quickly and it arrived in okay condition.  </li>
      <li>it helps smooth the eye area</li>
      <li>It is far more comfortable and effective than others I have used.</li>
      <li>Finally find something great</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s good enough for nighttime use in the summer.</li>
      <li>For the price I guess it&#x27;s not bad just to have for a dab of moisture, but don&#x27;t expect greatness here.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
      <li>Really smooths out the eyelid area and makes fine lines at the corners disappear.</li>
      <li>It is smooth, not greasy and smooths out my under eye area better than any other Olay product.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>That being said, I am very picky about my eye cream with moisturinzing being the number one requirement.</li>
      <li>It really works for me and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist eye cream for a couple years, and decided to try this product since it was much cheaper.</li>
      <li>This is very soothing and moisturizes your eyes all night.  </li>
      <li>or it just should of been handled more carefully.  </li>
      <li>I love Olay products and use them faithfully over more expensive products.</li>
      <li>It seems to moisturize but has not gotten rid of any fine lines or dark circles.</li>
      <li>I use a little under the eyes before applying concealer so the concealer goes on smoothly without tugging.</li>
      <li>Hope it keeps me looking as young as it did my mom.</li>
      <li>This stuff is SUPER thin, which I guess may be good for some people, but to me it basically feels like putting super expensive water on my face.</li>
      <li>It makes no other fanciful promises; it just moisturizes well.</li>
      <li>It goes on nicely and seems to sooth my eye area leaving it less dry and less wrinkled.  </li>

<li> I have been using this eye cream for a few days now</li>
<li> I hate it when they feel sticky as if they are supposed to glue your wrinkles smooth or something.</li>

<li> I use it in the daytime in cold, dry weather</li>
<li> I was highly disappointed; might as well just use hand lotion.</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <li> Exactly what I wanted. I received the product very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this. I resolves the dry, flaky skin on brow above the inside corner of my eyes. I use a little under the eyes before applying concealer so the concealer goes on smoothly without tugging.</li>
    <li> This is a pleasantly moisturizing, creamy petrolatum-type product that is also fairly inexpensive for its type. It says &amp;#34;age defying,&amp;#34; but that just means it will moisturize the skin around your eyes and make your lines less visible for a few hours. It makes no other fanciful promises; it just moisturizes well. I use it in the daytime in cold, dry weather and it&#x27;s good enough for nighttime use in the summer.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I can&#x27;t believe they have stopped production....seems that&#x27;s what the manufacturers do.  It really works for me and&lt;br /&gt;I am 75!</li>
    <li> This is very soothing and moisturizes your eyes all night.  It&#x27;s nice to feel this even in the morning! I hate to wash it off.</li>
    <li> will definitely buy again. I love Olay products. Hope it keeps me looking as young as it did my mom.</li>
    <li> Tip broke off into cap and it will now try up. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I would not buy again. It does not seem to moisturize at all. That being said, I am very picky about my eye cream with moisturinzing being the number one requirement. I hate it when they feel sticky as if they are supposed to glue your wrinkles smooth or something. I can&#x27;t imagine what other purpose sticky serves.</li>
    <li> Really smooths out the eyelid area and makes fine lines at the corners disappear. Has a nice light application. good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist eye cream for a couple years, and decided to try this product since it was much cheaper. I was highly disappointed; might as well just use hand lotion. You get what you pay for. I&#x27;ll stick to what I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> great eye cream and great for touch ups throughout the day when your eyes get dry</li>
    <li> This stuff is SUPER thin, which I guess may be good for some people, but to me it basically feels like putting super expensive water on my face.</li>
    <li> I keep reading reviews of other products and trying them, only to keep coming back to this product. I&#x27;ve used oil of Olay for over 20 years now and I like to stick with what I already know works well. At first I could only find this product combined with the eyelash enhancer &amp; not happy about it since I did not want or need that product. Now I found it separate &amp; a good price. It is smooth, not greasy and smooths out my under eye area better than any other Olay product. The smell is also very light and pleasant.</li>
    <li> The only eye cream I use</li>
    <li> Finally find something great and I think this is being discontinued. Someone sits at  a desk somewhere and decides to stop making something. Love it for the reason it is in a TUBE, easy to put on....a little goes a long way. More of a gel than a cream and it seems to help the skin under my eyes!</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent price.</li>
    <li> it helps smooth the eye area</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Keeps the tissue around your eyes moisturized.</li>
    <li> This temporarily smooths wrinkles around the eye, and feels soothing. It is far more comfortable and effective than others I have used.</li>
    <li> This product met my expectation on 100%! This is exactly what I needed.Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any difference at all. It seems to moisturize but has not gotten rid of any fine lines or dark circles. Will continue to look for a better product.</li>
    <li> I have used tons of eye products over the years.  I either find ones that work but burn my eyes or find ones that don&#x27;t work but do not burn my eyes.  I love Olay products anyways.  I have been using this eye cream for a few days now and I love it.  It goes on nicely and seems to sooth my eye area leaving it less dry and less wrinkled.  It does not burn my eyes at all.  The smell is pleasant and I would purchase again.  The seller shipped it quickly and it arrived in okay condition.  It was shipped in a bubble envelope which was great but once I opened the envelope, the Olay box was opened as if it had be crushed.  However, the tube was fine and not leaking.  I think the eye cream should of been mailed in a box or it just should of been handled more carefully.  But I love this eye cream and it works.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products and use them faithfully over more expensive products. However, this eye cream is nothing great. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not super emollient and if you have extreme dryness in the sensitive area under and around your eyes, this just won&#x27;t cut it by itself. For the price I guess it&#x27;s not bad just to have for a dab of moisture, but don&#x27;t expect greatness here.</li>
