      <li>It&#x27;s creamy, and goes on so nicely.</li>
      <li>Personally I liked the color</li>
      <li>Its very light</li>
      <li>It is a very good product because I am very sensitive about cosmetic products and this is safe.</li>
      <li>the color is very light - I was hoping more for a nude</li>
      <li>Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>Must say that I love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>Love love love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>Love love love it.</li>
      <li>it works much better.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this color too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased MAC lipsticks here on Amazon from MacMakeupDivas and always got authentic MAC.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going through a lip color phase, natural/nude lip colors are my latest.</li>
      <li>By safe</li>
      <li>natural look, great stuff.  </li>
      <li>Also, i researched and researched and ended up buying this on the Mac website for $16 free shipping :)</li>
      <li>I use the glo-minterals pink blossom gloss over it and it gives you the perfect nude lip.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color in the tube, but definitely not a color for the masses.</li>
      <li>You can tell how smooth it</li>
      <li>For it to look like a more natural nude I must apply with another color on top.</li>
      <li>Love love the color but does dry out my lips.</li>
      <li>As all MAC lipsticks it applies veeeery smoothly, but the color is much lighter than what the picture presents.</li>
      <li>:) So far i&#x27;ve noticed it lasts up to 6 hours on me, but I haven&#x27;t went without eating and drinking, of course.  </li>
      <li>but with a little lipgloss it is amazing!</li>
      <li>and I think this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought that many at once.  </li>
      <li>If you want more of a nude, which this is pretty nude and oka for evey day, but more nude and only needed with dark makeup or smokey eyes, get the Mac in Myth.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>It is really moisturizing when it is applied as well.</li>
      <li>The lipstick came very well packaged</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing, can apply without Chapstik underneath.  </li>
      <li>Pink nude with slight shimmer that gives it that extra perfect dimension.  </li>
      <li>I have the light pink as well.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking.</li>
      <li>I love this color, i am not sure how i feel about wearing it alone</li>
      <li>looks\\&quot;  I only tried it on the first time and showed him the color to get that expression.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a black woman of caramel complexion, so the color is a bit too light; however, with lip liner and an application of MAC&#x27;s Velvet Teddy and Smashbox L.A. Lights  </li>
      <li>The color came out white on my lips.i thought it was going to blend into my light pink lips</li>
      <li>I apply Vaseline or clear lip gloss before applying</li>
      <li>Was looking for a clear shining lip gloss.</li>
      <li>This by itself is way too light for me I think, but I mix with St. Germain plus nars orgasm lip gloss in that order for a subtle light baby pink lip.</li>
      <li>And it really does not stay on very long</li>

<li> this is not worth the money and it doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
<li> This is very thick and almost white.</li>
<li> Color is too pale compared to the picture shown, it almost seems like a concealer on your lips</li>
<li> Usually I have to put Chapstick on before I apply lipstick because it drys my lips out with this one I do not have to.</li>
<li> It has a little shine to it and is Sooo moisturizing!!</li>
<li> so I settled on this color since it was less expensive from the site</li>
<li> so there were no cracks or broken lipstick.</li>
<li> I mean it does not contain crazy chemicals.</li>

    <li> I love this color, i am not sure how i feel about wearing it alone but with a little lipgloss it is amazing! I use the glo-minterals pink blossom gloss over it and it gives you the perfect nude lip.</li>
    <li> As all MAC lipsticks it applies veeeery smoothly, but the color is much lighter than what the picture presents. For it to look like a more natural nude I must apply with another color on top. My skin is light-tan (latin).</li>
    <li> Very nice lipstick and the shade is beautiful. Very natural looking. The lipstick came very well packaged so there were no cracks or broken lipstick. I definetly recommend this product to purchase.</li>
    <li> the color is very light - I was hoping more for a nude look.&lt;br /&gt;It almost appears frosted in color.</li>
    <li> Love love love this lipstick. The only downfall was that the lipstick broke within one month of use. Idk why or what happened but it looks wonderful on my skin. I would advise any woman of color to purchase this lipstick. Its very light and it makes your skin POP, the best part is that you don&#x27;t have to apply a lot on your lips</li>
    <li> The product is just this side of white or cream tone.  Beautiful color in the tube, but definitely not a color for the masses.</li>
    <li> The color came out white on my lips.i thought it was going to blend into my light pink lips and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love this color too.  I have the light pink as well.,&lt;br /&gt;Very natural look, great stuff.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Very nice shade on brown skin!!! LOVE IT!!! This was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> I love It ! 💗💗😁 I Use It On Nights Out And It Looks Really Amazing !</li>
    <li> Great service. Just not what I expected. Was looking for a clear shining lip gloss. This is very thick and almost white.</li>
    <li> this is not worth the money and it doesn&#x27;t stay on and I dislike the color. I wanted Honeylove but that went up in price before I could buy it so I settled on this color since it was less expensive from the site and I regret not sticking to a brand from Walmart such as L&#x27;oreal. I will never buy another MAC lipstick for that money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lipstick because I saw so many girls on u tube tutorial saying how great it is. Personally I liked the color but it made my lips feel very dry. And it really does not stay on very long so you have to carry it with you were ever you go.</li>
    <li> Color is too pale compared to the picture shown, it almost seems like a concealer on your lips and it doesn&#x27;t blend evenly.</li>
    <li> Must say that I love this lipstick. Usually I have to put Chapstick on before I apply lipstick because it drys my lips out with this one I do not have to. I am in LOVE!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going through a lip color phase, natural/nude lip colors are my latest. This is a beautiful color, but it makes my lips look chalky. I&#x27;m a black woman of caramel complexion, so the color is a bit too light; however, with lip liner and an application of MAC&#x27;s Velvet Teddy and Smashbox L.A. Lights  Venice Beach Bronze  - it works much better.</li>
    <li> Love love love it. It&#x27;s creamy, and goes on so nicely. If you are more of a nude kinda gal, I&#x27;d give this a try!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a nice nude color! This is a perfect nude! I love the MAC vanilla smell too!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I am african american with a caramel skin tone. This by itself is way too light for me I think, but I mix with St. Germain plus nars orgasm lip gloss in that order for a subtle light baby pink lip. Looks great. Next time I&#x27;ll have to go to Mac store to try another nude shade.</li>
    <li> Love love the color but does dry out my lips. I apply Vaseline or clear lip gloss before applying</li>
    <li> I love this Cremesheen lipstick!  Pink nude with slight shimmer that gives it that extra perfect dimension.  Very moisturizing, can apply without Chapstik underneath.  I&#x27;ve purchased MAC lipsticks here on Amazon from MacMakeupDivas and always got authentic MAC.</li>
    <li> Perfect for plumped look nude lips. It is really moisturizing when it is applied as well. It is a very good product because I am very sensitive about cosmetic products and this is safe. By safe I mean it does not contain crazy chemicals.</li>
    <li> I wear it almost every day.  It has a little shine to it and is Sooo moisturizing!! i wear it all day and it never shows lines or cracks or dries up.  It smells amazing, like vanilla.  I could smell it all day.  Actually I do smell it all day while it&#x27;s on my lips :) So far i&#x27;ve noticed it lasts up to 6 hours on me, but I haven&#x27;t went without eating and drinking, of course.  It does stay on after i eat and drink unless i wipe it with my napkin.  I could pat dry and keep the tint on my lips when finished eating if I wanted to.  My husband was even like, \\&quot;WHOA!  That makes a difference. You can tell how smooth it looks\\&quot;  I only tried it on the first time and showed him the color to get that expression.&lt;br /&gt;  If you want more of a nude, which this is pretty nude and oka for evey day, but more nude and only needed with dark makeup or smokey eyes, get the Mac in Myth.&lt;br /&gt;  Also, i researched and researched and ended up buying this on the Mac website for $16 free shipping :)</li>
    <li> I bought four tubes last time... and I think this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought that many at once.  PLEASE keep this color ~ it&#x27;s the perfect shade!</li>
