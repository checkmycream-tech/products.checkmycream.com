      <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
      <li>It also helped to treat my gums very quickly!</li>
      <li>so I was delighted to be able to purchase the original formula through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Euthymol is much better.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love the taste and feel.</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>my favorite toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;رهيببب</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste as does everyone that has tried it.</li>
      <li>It will put a stop to bleeding gums for sure.</li>
      <li>My friend loves this toothpaste, it isn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It is 500 times better than Colgate.  </li>
      <li>Great I just enjoy the clean fresh feeling</li>
      <li>Hopefully, the new formula will be as good as the original.  </li>
      <li>You know I really like this kind of stuff</li>
      <li>I wish it was available here in America.</li>
      <li>if you use it the first time is strong, but your mouth feels superclean, like after a treatment with the dental hygienist!</li>
      <li>not the usual minty taste but wonderful</li>
      <li>After using it, your mouth feels EXTREMELY clean.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really care for the metal tube, but is probably better for you than the plastic tubes.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste is quite strong but really gives your mouth a clean feeling with a zing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the new formulation but preferred the old one - it seemed to have more of that wintergreen BITE that this one lacks.</li>
      <li>It makes the mouth fresh and there is no need for mouthwash.</li>
      <li>hubby is a smoker and he thinks that it seems to keep his teeth nice and white</li>
      <li>If burns but really really worth it.</li>
      <li>I had a toothache when I first tried it, and after using Euthymol - the pain went away.</li>
      <li>but I feel what I paid was &#x27;somewhat reasonable&#x27; considering how rare it has become.  </li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, it leaves my teeth feeling as clean as a &#x27;modern&#x27; toothpaste formula.  </li>
      <li>It has a distinctive, old-fashioned and very invigorating taste that you won&#x27;t mistake for anything else.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Because of the difficulty in locating it, the price has really shot-up</li>
      <li>It does make your teeth feel clean, smooth &amp; look a little whiter.  </li>
      <li>Less chemicals, so better for you.  </li>
      <li>Every since my husband brought me several tubes of Euthymol home from London, several years ago, I&#x27;ve been in love with this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Discovered in Ireland - can&#x27;t buy in New Zealand.</li>
      <li>I use it mainly because it&#x27;s one of the few toothpastes that don&#x27;t include flourides, which are known to cause significant damage to the brain.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll do, though, and I still prefer it to pretty much any American toothpaste on the market - including and especially Tom&#x27;s, which irritates the heck out of my slightly-receded gums.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Which brings me to another important point: if you too are of a certain age where this is beginning to be a problem for you, this toothpaste, although not specified for gum sensitivity, seems not to bother them (or at least mine).</li>
      <li>Been using this paste since I was 12 years old.</li>
      <li>It has funny pink color)))</li>
      <li>The taste is a little unusual like you eat something spicy, but after several days you will get used to it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my favorite toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;رهيببب</li>
    <li> Great I just enjoy the clean fresh feeling</li>
    <li> My friend introduced me to this toothpaste when she returned from London with a handful....it was the best gift ever! I&#x27;m loving it!!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is quite strong but really gives your mouth a clean feeling with a zing. I use it mainly because it&#x27;s one of the few toothpastes that don&#x27;t include flourides, which are known to cause significant damage to the brain. Other fluroide-free toothpastes taste bland and unpleasant. Euthymol is much better.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great.  It doesn&#x27;t have all of the ingredients that are bad for us....and it has a good flavor.  Sometimes, it can even be a bit spicy but it does the trick and also carries on airplanes. :)</li>
    <li> Love the taste and feel. However, there&#x27;s no fluoride in the product, so... It&#x27;s not-that-great for the teeth. Perhaps the reformulation will fix this.</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, it leaves my teeth feeling as clean as a &#x27;modern&#x27; toothpaste formula.  So that leaves us with the simple matter of taste... and what&#x27;s there to say about the taste of toothpaste?  How do you even describe it?  It doesn&#x27;t taste like chicken.  It has a distinctive, old-fashioned and very invigorating taste that you won&#x27;t mistake for anything else.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has funny pink color))) It makes my teeth feel cleaner than any other brand I&#x27;ve personally tried. The taste is a little unusual like you eat something spicy, but after several days you will get used to it. It also helped to treat my gums very quickly!</li>
    <li> Every since my husband brought me several tubes of Euthymol home from London, several years ago, I&#x27;ve been in love with this toothpaste. I had a toothache when I first tried it, and after using Euthymol - the pain went away. Try it....you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
    <li> I got this toothpaste as a gift and since then I&#x27;m hooked! Yes the flavor and the expirience if you use it the first time is strong, but your mouth feels superclean, like after a treatment with the dental hygienist!</li>
    <li> You know I really like this kind of stuff so thats why  I decided to buy this item from you</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist cannot believe the difference this toothpaste makes!  We did an experiment to see if a Colgate product worked as well.  After a long time in the chair with lots of concerns about my teeth and gums, she looked at me and said, \\&quot;Go back to the pink stuff.\\&quot;  It is 500 times better than Colgate.  I even gave her a tube and she is now hooked on it too.</li>
    <li> not the usual minty taste but wonderful toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hubby is a smoker and he thinks that it seems to keep his teeth nice and white</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste as does everyone that has tried it. Good price here.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I totally understand the cult type following.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste. Not sold in the US can only get on amazon</li>
    <li> This toothpaste makes your mouth feel excellent, it removes plaque well and has antiseptic properties to help manage periodontal disease</li>
    <li> Been using this paste since I was 12 years old. If burns but really really worth it. After using it, your mouth feels EXTREMELY clean. It will put a stop to bleeding gums for sure.</li>
    <li> My friend loves this toothpaste, it isn&#x27;t my favorite.  It does make your teeth feel clean, smooth &amp; look a little whiter.  Less chemicals, so better for you.  Don&#x27;t really care for the metal tube, but is probably better for you than the plastic tubes.  I still use it about 2 times per week.</li>
    <li> I like the package. The expiry duration is a year away. It makes the mouth fresh and there is no need for mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for years and usually purchase it in the UK when visiting.  However, it&#x27;s temporarily off the market until EU regulations are met so I was delighted to be able to purchase the original formula through Amazon.  Because of the difficulty in locating it, the price has really shot-up but I feel what I paid was &#x27;somewhat reasonable&#x27; considering how rare it has become.  Hopefully, the new formula will be as good as the original.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really an excellent toothpaste to use ever. I will conplete purchise this items always. Its the best in my view.</li>
    <li> Nothing but nothing cleans your pearlies like Euthymol.  I love it..missed it for years after coming to the USA unless someone sent a gift.  Very happy to be able to purchase now.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! I wish it was available here in America.</li>
    <li> Discovered in Ireland - can&#x27;t buy in New Zealand.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why companies can&#x27;t just leave well enough alone. I&#x27;m satisfied with the new formulation but preferred the old one - it seemed to have more of that wintergreen BITE that this one lacks. It&#x27;ll do, though, and I still prefer it to pretty much any American toothpaste on the market - including and especially Tom&#x27;s, which irritates the heck out of my slightly-receded gums.&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to another important point: if you too are of a certain age where this is beginning to be a problem for you, this toothpaste, although not specified for gum sensitivity, seems not to bother them (or at least mine). It doesn&#x27;t alleviate the problem but it doesn&#x27;t aggravate it either.</li>
