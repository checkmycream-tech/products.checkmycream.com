      <li>The person liked that scent and now will be able to purchase it thanks.</li>
      <li>So even if she&#x27;s not wearing it - I still react strongly to what&#x27;s on her clothes in her hamper.</li>
      <li>Came quick will order again!</li>
      <li>It came in the big bottle and it smells good :)</li>
      <li>My favorite scent in a bottle :) It was shipped relatively fast as well.</li>
      <li>and sooooo much cheaper!!!</li>
      <li>This product arrived quick and damage free.  </li>
      <li>I am stopped all the time in public by people telling me how good I smell.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s suprising, once it&#x27;s sprayed on the skin, does last a good length of time.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my order and would definitely order again.</li>

      <li>it was a completely full bottle... just like brand new!</li>

      <li>Dark Kiss is my favorite of the Bath and Body Works Sig collection, because it smells modern.</li>
      <li>Lets just hope they still have some once my better half runs out of it...</li>
      <li>Seller sent it in different bottle than shown (old B&amp;BW bottle) but genuine scent</li>
      <li>Wound get a more concentrated type of the same fragrance next time.</li>
      <li>Other reviews notes that the fragrance lingers and is strong.</li>
      <li>If you are lucky to find it and try it do so because it was out in stores for a limited time only</li>
      <li>I first bought this fragrance in a shower gel for my niece one Christmas a few years ago who just loves it.  </li>

<li> Highly recommended if you like the &amp;#34;darker scents&amp;#34; i.e Black Raspberry Vanilla, Twilight Woods, Blackberry Woods etc.</li>
<li> Its much much stronger than I usually tolerate in a fragrance, but oddly enough I paired with midnight pomegranate from BATH &amp; BODY as well</li>
<li> I guess this scent is hard to find in retail stores, as my wife was ecstatic when she saw it on Amazon (for a much lower price than retail, I might add).</li>

<li> My step daughters favorite sad to see its been discontinued!</li>
<li> I liked dark kiss, too bad its a discontinued item.</li>
<li> Honestly not really...</li>
<li> However, it causes me a headache, breathing problems, nausea, and extreme fatige.</li>
<li> We are not able to find this product in our local stores.  </li>
<li> I ordered this a few days ago</li>
<li> This smell is a everyday smell...</li>
<li> but I wish they would explain that you&#x27;re receiving 3 small bottles instead of 1.</li>
<li> but instead they send you 3 small bottles.</li>
<li> My fault for buying blind.</li>
<li> I am so sad this is discontinued from the store.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Simply love this scent!!! If you are lucky to find it and try it do so because it was out in stores for a limited time only and they don&#x27;t have it anymore. But I totally recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended if you like the &amp;#34;darker scents&amp;#34; i.e Black Raspberry Vanilla, Twilight Woods, Blackberry Woods etc. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance ! Awesome will buy again A+++++++</li>
    <li> Best smelling mist EVER. I am so sad this is discontinued from the store.  I get so many compliments on this.</li>
    <li> Came quick will order again!</li>
    <li> My future daughter-in-law asked for this for Christmas and since Bath &amp; Body Works does not carry it anymore, which I do not know why, I purchased it so she could have it.</li>
    <li> smells sooooo good and sweet</li>
    <li> My step daughters favorite sad to see its been discontinued! Lets us know when its back in stock we miss it</li>
    <li> Dark kiss is one of my favorite fragrance, it last all day I get a lot of compliments also love the price.</li>
    <li> I initally purchased this scent package from B &amp; B W, for my mother. After I got home, and was not surrounded by distractions, and sales persons, I took a good whiff, and all I can say I&#x27;m goin back for more; yep for me. Discribed as a warm floral &amp; berry kick, with vanilla musk undertones. It is sultry with a controlled vibrancy that hits you, but doesn&#x27;t annoy the scences. What&#x27;s suprising, once it&#x27;s sprayed on the skin, does last a good length of time. Dark Kiss is my favorite of the Bath and Body Works Sig collection, because it smells modern. However Japanese Cherry Blossom runs a good second, but it is more of a mature scent in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. My favorite B&amp;BW fragrence</li>
    <li> This product arrived quick and damage free.  I love this body spray wish I could buy more.</li>
    <li> Fantastic fragrance!!! My favorite bath and bodyworks scent..last all day..many people ask what im wearing ..its my everyday perfume..a musk backround with a touch of sweet..love it:):)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love that I could buy this scent and don&#x27;t have to worry about ordering it on B&amp;B works.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances.</li>
    <li> it was a completely full bottle... just like brand new! and sooooo much cheaper!!! everyone who loves this fragrance should get it from this person</li>
    <li> We are not able to find this product in our local stores.  The person that received them was very happy. The person liked that scent and now will be able to purchase it thanks.</li>
    <li> Seller sent it in different bottle than shown (old B&amp;BW bottle) but genuine scent so I am satisfied!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for a granddaughter, she was very happy with our choice of product to get her. She really liked it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent. From the photo you assume that you&#x27;re getting one 8 oz bottle but instead they send you 3 small bottles. The scent is great but I wish they would explain that you&#x27;re receiving 3 small bottles instead of 1.</li>
    <li> This item delivered really quickly and it was exactly what I ordered. They discontinued this scent at bath and body works so I bought every bottle I could find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance!!! I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not sold any longer in the stores, but I wish that they would bring it back.  I ordered this a few days ago and I was extra excited when it arrived.  I received two 8oz. bottles and can&#x27;t wait to use them.  I am stopped all the time in public by people telling me how good I smell.  I am very pleased with my order and would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I liked dark kiss, too bad its a discontinued item. Its much much stronger than I usually tolerate in a fragrance, but oddly enough I paired with midnight pomegranate from BATH &amp; BODY as well, it made a perfect mix of sexy musk with a hint of fruity sweetness. Do I like it stand alone? Honestly not really...the fragrance mist is about all I could handle &amp; then I mixed it with pomegranate</li>
    <li> I first bought this fragrance in a shower gel for my niece one Christmas a few years ago who just loves it.  Since then we have purchased the entire line of products (hand cream, body lotion, mist, shower gel) for this fragrance through the retailer.  When they stopped carrying it in the stores my niece had a panic attack.  Nice to know I can count on Amazon to find it for me.</li>
    <li> The order came on the second day of the expected delivery dates. It came in the big bottle and it smells good :)</li>
    <li> I do not like this scent. My fault for buying blind.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has used it for years. It smells amazing! I was scared I wouldnt be able to find it after it was discontinued. She loved it!</li>
    <li> My stepdaughter loves this fragrance, and it does smell nice. However, it causes me a headache, breathing problems, nausea, and extreme fatige. The chemical list and fragrance mixes used include known irritants. Other reviews notes that the fragrance lingers and is strong. So even if she&#x27;s not wearing it - I still react strongly to what&#x27;s on her clothes in her hamper. I can&#x27;t get it out of our home.</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful fragrance............Please don&#x27;t take it off the market!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for severall years............</li>
    <li> My favorite scent ..this was a great purchase. .it was sent to me very quickly!</li>
    <li> Wound get a more concentrated type of the same fragrance next time.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent in a bottle :) It was shipped relatively fast as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect time. I love it.</li>
    <li> This smell is a everyday smell...yay. Works well with any outfit</li>
    <li> This product purchase was for my wife, quen uses this line of beauty products for several years. She is fascinated</li>
    <li> I guess this scent is hard to find in retail stores, as my wife was ecstatic when she saw it on Amazon (for a much lower price than retail, I might add). It was the real-deal and not a knock off that the peddlers try to sell you in the parking lot at your local retailer. Lets just hope they still have some once my better half runs out of it...</li>
