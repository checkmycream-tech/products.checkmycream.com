      <li>Really nice to purchase on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled when I found out Suave had this cream.</li>
      <li>but they were still perfectly in place and nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Better product than most salon leave in conditioners that I have purchased!</li>
      <li>I loved this product,it light on the hair not greasy</li>
      <li>I have recommended it to many people.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The price is better than any place ive seen.</li>
      <li>Why would anyone ever change such a wonderful product?</li>
      <li>This is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It took the snarls out of kids&#x27; hair like magic.    </li>
      <li>Great deal, low cost + good hair care.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Feels like it has a polymer in it, which I&#x27;m sure the original recipe did not.  </li>
      <li>I never let myself run out and at this price that is easy to do</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few leave-in conditioners and the Suave Styling Cream is the best - even better than ones costing two and three times what Suave does.</li>
      <li>It smelled fantastic and literally one drop of it on your palm</li>
      <li>and I knew I could smooth the flyaways with the cream.</li>
      <li>My hair felt smooth and sleek instead of frizzy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>14 year old niece used some of it and was delighted.</li>
      <li>I never noted how long it lasts, all I know is that I have great</li>
      <li>It definitely removes the frizz and gives your hair a really good shine.</li>
      <li>This is the next best thing to the L&#x27;oreal Paris product that was discontinued awhile back.  </li>
      <li>I occasionally bought that one before Suave began making their own.</li>
      <li>Really worth the effort.</li>
      <li>I liked how the old formula made my hair feel so soft and frizz free.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this product available on amazon since I can&#x27;t find it in any of the big box stores near me and haven&#x27;t found it again at the dollar store either!  </li>
      <li>Any product that simplifies my routine makes my life easier, and that is exactly what that product did.</li>
      <li>Not to mention it&#x27;s much cheaper!</li>
      <li>Then this morning, I went to take a shower, but first I looked at my hair.</li>
      <li>This products makes my hair look much healthier!</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time yesterday and then got in the car to run errands.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells and how simple it is to use.  </li>
      <li>I have been so pleased with this purchase that I am in the process of trying other suave products in hopes of other pleasant surprises.  </li>
      <li>I searched the internet for best reviews and was able to narrow it down to several options.  </li>
      <li>Too much will make hair look flat, but with a little trial and error one should be able to find the right amount for one&#x27;s own hair.</li>
      <li>The older product is actually way better.  </li>
      <li>I normally use a different name brand but this works better for my hair.</li>
      <li>I have never applied it to my hair while it&#x27;s dry, and I certainly use more than just a dab.  </li>
      <li>I have frizzy hair and this controls the frizz very well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I used to have perfectly straight hair without one iota of frizz.  </li>
      <li>Suave professionals definitely well worth the money!</li>
      <li>I finally made my way down the list to the Suave Professionals Styling Cream, and arrived surprisingly at Hair-Nirvana.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the same, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
      <li>I have been trying for a couple of months to get used to the new formula, but can do it no longer!  </li>
      <li>I caught my reflection in a mirror at work and was slightly embarrassed at how floofy my hair had gotten and how many fly-aways there were...</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel oily but is very soft and straight.</li>
      <li>My search is on for a new brand that is exactly like the old Suave formula.  </li>
      <li>Years ago Suave made a lovely cream conditioner in a little glass bottle that looked sort of like a flattened (sideways) bee hive.  </li>
      <li>Now they changed the package and the formula, and I threw the rest of the new tube away after trying it once.</li>
      <li>Better than the expensive brands that do not make my hair as smooth.  </li>
      <li>I have frizzy hair that can only be tamed into soft curls on rare occasions.</li>
      <li>I think if only they could see my hair w/o the cream in it, it&#x27;s pretty frizzy.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and, yes, SLEEK!  </li>
      <li>I feel both worked the same, but the new one containes less product, so you pay more.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t understand why they changed the formula when the old one was perfect : (</li>
      <li>would keep your dry ends smooth until your next shampoo.</li>
      <li>It separates and defines the natural curl without frizz.  </li>
      <li>and WOW,</li>
      <li>Everyone who hugs me tells me how soft my hair feels.  </li>
      <li>Suave, bring back your old formula!!!</li>
      <li>Normally when I wake up, my hair is a giant frizz ball.</li>
      <li>I bought the Suave anti-frizz cream on a whim from Dollar General (NOT for $1, go figure).  </li>
      <li>Next time I will buy the old one.</li>
      <li>I have written to Suave asking them to bring back the old formula to give us a choice between the two.  </li>
      <li>I bought it because I thought it&#x27;s the same as the old suave hair cream.  </li>
      <li>At first, I was using a small dab on dry hair to smooth out the rough spots and add a bit of sheen.  </li>
      <li>I use about a nickel sized dollop throughout my hair, concentrating on the frizziest parts of my hair, comb through, and then blow dry as normal.  </li>
      <li>I am VERY allergic to all other anti-frizz products that I&#x27;ve tried-</li>
      <li>The new formula makes it feel dry and it looks greasy.  </li>
      <li>This worked pretty well, but I did notice, like some other reviewers, that it could leave my hair looking greasy or limp if I used too much, or didn&#x27;t distribute it evenly enough.  </li>
      <li>Having never used the old version of this product, I can&#x27;t compare the two, but if you are having issues with this product on dry hair, give it a shot on damp hair instead!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What happened to the cream in the orange tube???? That was the BEST smoothing cream I have EVER used. This cream is nothing like it. I occasionally bought that one before Suave began making their own. I was thrilled when I found out Suave had this cream. I have thick wavy hair. That stuff never made it greasy, gave me perfect texture, and the smell was heavenly. This one makes my hair greasy and dry at the same time. Why would anyone ever change such a wonderful product? Any product that simplifies my routine makes my life easier, and that is exactly what that product did.</li>
    <li> I am VERY allergic to all other anti-frizz products that I&#x27;ve tried- this is the only one that I can tolerate. It really helps my unruly colored hair to look less frizzy, and it also keeps my curl cream from creating hard, crispy curls. Only wish I&#x27;d found this stuff sooner!</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair and this controls the frizz very well. Too much will make hair look flat, but with a little trial and error one should be able to find the right amount for one&#x27;s own hair. Really worth the effort. Product is hard to find in my area of South Texas. Really nice to purchase on Amazon. Cheaper too.</li>
    <li> Why do some companies make a terrific product and then just lose the recipe for some reason (Ivory Snow did this with its \\&quot;baby\\&quot; fragrance, for instance; now it just smells like laundry soap)?      Years ago Suave made a lovely cream conditioner in a little glass bottle that looked sort of like a flattened (sideways) bee hive.  The cream was \\&quot;cream\\&quot; colored, almost like honey.  It smelled fantastic and literally one drop of it on your palm would keep your dry ends smooth until your next shampoo. It took the snarls out of kids&#x27; hair like magic.    Well, I bought this one to see if it was the same thing, but in a tube.  It&#x27;s not the same, but it&#x27;s not bad.  Feels like it has a polymer in it, which I&#x27;m sure the original recipe did not.  Just use a very small amount, as per the instructions. For the money, you get some help with those ends; just don&#x27;t expect it to be $60.00 Moroccan oil!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been addicted to Suave Anti-Frizz, in the orange tube, for years -- it is the only thing that makes my very curly hair behave. Now they changed the package and the formula, and I threw the rest of the new tube away after trying it once. If you like products containing lots of silicone, you will probably like this, but they just make my hair greasy and don&#x27;t control the frizz. Suave, bring back your old formula!!!</li>
    <li> I loved this product,it light on the hair not greasy it gives the hair shine without being heavy.The price is better than any place ive seen.I would definitely reorder this product.</li>
    <li> This is the first treatment that truly affects my hair--IN A GREAT WAY!!!!  I have recommended it to many people.</li>
    <li> This is the next best thing to the L&#x27;oreal Paris product that was discontinued awhile back.  I am so glad that I found it!  I bought the multipack so I wouldn&#x27;t run out any time soon!  Great for smoothing curly hair when straightening!</li>
    <li> perfect weight, not greasy, nice smell</li>
    <li> I have tried biosilk, Paul Mitchell, coconut milk, and more! This is my favorite. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel oily but is very soft and straight. Not to mention it&#x27;s much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Excellent as a leave on hair conditioner.It definitely removes the frizz and gives your hair a really good shine.A 5 star!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  This product works wonderfully for curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;  This was a great deal also.  I will.order it again.</li>
    <li> Suave professionals definitely well worth the money! I have thick, curly hair and it gets frizzy sometimes.  I use a pearl size of this stuff and it works wonders.  Their shampoo and conditioners are great too!  I have paid hundreds for salon products, but they don&#x27;[t measure up!  I am sold on Suave!</li>
    <li> Not the orange packaging product shown  what I received was in purple packaging and was a completely different product.</li>
    <li> Better product than most salon leave in conditioners that I have purchased! I never let myself run out and at this price that is easy to do</li>
    <li> I used to have perfectly straight hair without one iota of frizz.  After having children, my hair texture changed drastically and I was left with drier, frizzier hair that was \\&quot;trying\\&quot; to be wavy, and woefully failing.  I bought the Suave anti-frizz cream on a whim from Dollar General (NOT for $1, go figure).  At first, I was using a small dab on dry hair to smooth out the rough spots and add a bit of sheen.  This worked pretty well, but I did notice, like some other reviewers, that it could leave my hair looking greasy or limp if I used too much, or didn&#x27;t distribute it evenly enough.  But then I decided to use it on my damp hair instead and WOW, what a difference!! I use about a nickel sized dollop throughout my hair, concentrating on the frizziest parts of my hair, comb through, and then blow dry as normal.  My hair is so soft and, yes, SLEEK!  I am so glad I found this product available on amazon since I can&#x27;t find it in any of the big box stores near me and haven&#x27;t found it again at the dollar store either!  Having never used the old version of this product, I can&#x27;t compare the two, but if you are having issues with this product on dry hair, give it a shot on damp hair instead!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Better than the expensive brands that do not make my hair as smooth.  Its hard to find in the stores so I am grateful to find it here.</li>
    <li> I have been trying for a couple of months to get used to the new formula, but can do it no longer!  It is awful!  I liked how the old formula made my hair feel so soft and frizz free.  The new formula makes it feel dry and it looks greasy.  I have tried using less, so it won&#x27;t look oily, but that doesn&#x27;t work.  I have written to Suave asking them to bring back the old formula to give us a choice between the two.  My search is on for a new brand that is exactly like the old Suave formula.  I can&#x27;t understand why they changed the formula when the old one was perfect : (</li>
    <li> I have waist length frizzy hair.  After showering, I apply a good amount to my damp hair either before or after brushing it out.  I blow my hair dry over a long period of time to help the product increase the curls, which are tendril sized.  I think it works great.  You can&#x27;t tell I use a product at all.  I get lots of compliments.  I think if only they could see my hair w/o the cream in it, it&#x27;s pretty frizzy.  I have never applied it to my hair while it&#x27;s dry, and I certainly use more than just a dab.  I use a lot, but get it at Walmart for $2.50.  I never noted how long it lasts, all I know is that I have great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect it to help comb out tangles that I get from the tendril curls linking together if I don&#x27;t wash my hair regularly enough.  It&#x27;s an anti-frizz product, not a detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People mention the previous long orange tube.  I&#x27;m not savvy enough to know what the ingredients were and are now, though I see that one is still being sold on Amazon.  I feel both worked the same, but the new one containes less product, so you pay more.  I make sure I squeeze out as much as possible towards the end, but I think I will start cutting off the bottom to get the last of the product out, why leave it behind.</li>
    <li> The Suave styling cream was a great help in the humid summer weather. My hair felt smooth and sleek instead of frizzy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;My 14 year old niece used some of it and was delighted. I&#x27;ve ordered a number of tubes to give to her and other family members. Great deal, low cost + good hair care.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I thought it&#x27;s the same as the old suave hair cream.  The older product is actually way better.  Next time I will buy the old one.</li>
    <li> I always liked this stuff, but didn&#x27;t realize how great it was until I ran out for two days. Sheesh! I caught my reflection in a mirror at work and was slightly embarrassed at how floofy my hair had gotten and how many fly-aways there were... it didn&#x27;t look like that when I left the house, I swear! Thank goodness for Prime so I didn&#x27;t have to subject my co-workers to that for another day! I usually just towel dry my hair and run about a dime-sized portion through with my hands, starting in the back and working my way up and then blow dry and style as usual. Works great for me.</li>
    <li> I bought mine from a Dollar General for less than 4 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why bother paying extra here?&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the money, buy it there.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s not so heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like I put lacquer on it. A must have for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few leave-in conditioners and the Suave Styling Cream is the best - even better than ones costing two and three times what Suave does.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair that can only be tamed into soft curls on rare occasions. I have tried nearly every (affordable) product under the sun and even some expensive ones. This one is amazing. I used it for the first time yesterday and then got in the car to run errands. I had the windows open and expected my hair to be a mess when I got home but they were still perfectly in place and nice and soft. Then this morning, I went to take a shower, but first I looked at my hair. Normally when I wake up, my hair is a giant frizz ball. But my hairstyle was still basically in tact and I knew I could smooth the flyaways with the cream. So I used a shower cap and did just that and now my hair is just as it was yesterday: tame and soft...and it smells good too! I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with frizzy hair.  It&#x27;s so bad that the slightest change in humidity causes me to look like a chia pet sneezed.  About 5 years ago I finally stumbled upon a Garnier product that worked....I was in heaven!  Then, they changed the formula a year ago (without noting it on the bottle) and it took one use to realize that something was off.  Alas, I was forced, once again on my journey to find something that would tame this beast of a portable static induced electric storm.  I searched the internet for best reviews and was able to narrow it down to several options.  I, stupidly, went with some of the more expensive ones thinking erroneously that you &#x27;get what you pay for&#x27;.  I finally made my way down the list to the Suave Professionals Styling Cream, and arrived surprisingly at Hair-Nirvana.  My hair has always gotten compliments and this stuff brings them out in droves.  I do not style, color or dry my hair in any way.  I simply wash it, put the Antifrizz cream in it and go.  It separates and defines the natural curl without frizz.  Everyone who hugs me tells me how soft my hair feels.  I love the way it smells and how simple it is to use.  It does not make my hair oily or stiff and is simple to use.  I have been so pleased with this purchase that I am in the process of trying other suave products in hopes of other pleasant surprises.  Please don&#x27;t change a thing!!</li>
    <li> I have hair that obeys its location, but I cannot control it in humid places. This bottle of wonders has always been my fix for frizz. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I normally use a different name brand but this works better for my hair. I am 64 with greying highlights, I like to say, but the grey  looks dried out. This products makes my hair look much healthier! Great price,too.</li>
