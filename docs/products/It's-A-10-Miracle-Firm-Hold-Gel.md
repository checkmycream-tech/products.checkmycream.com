    <li> I was able to find my favorite hair gel $4 cheaper than I can purchase at my salon.  Thank you</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good. Not a firm hold, but really more of a soft hold. I actually prefer a crispier sort of result; this does tame the fly-aways and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch, like some do. I use it alternately with Sebastian Potion 9, very similar hold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hair gel.  No aroma, holds without flaking. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the only gel my husband has found that gives his hair a \\&quot;spikey\\&quot; look without leftover product making his hair feel dirty all day. We searched everywhere and could only find this online. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>

It stays pliable and has a natural look when in your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t get all gunky in your hair when you wash it out and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your scalp.  One of the best on the market.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Ten is always good, but this works brilliantly.  Would fully recommend.</li>
    <li> Good hair gel with medium hold.  Would buy again.</li>
