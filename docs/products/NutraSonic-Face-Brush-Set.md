      <li>Still have smooth skin, still works great.</li>
      <li>AMAZING from day 1</li>
      <li>I use it with any kind of soap.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t measure these rotations on my own...</li>
      <li>bad-I really liked this</li>
      <li>I own both of those items too</li>
      <li>Well, it does have a good strong motor, which is what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>I also have had great success with the battery.</li>
      <li>I felt better ordering what seems to be a superior product knowing that I am protected for a full year if I get a dud.</li>
      <li>$25 on most sites but</li>
      <li>Sonic (hereafter referred to as \\&quot;N\\&quot;)$15 on most sites</li>
      <li>, Nutra Sonic truly felt like it had more power...</li>
      <li>however, that also meant there was a bit more splatter.</li>
      <li>but after the 6 day most of the acne disappeared and the 10th day her skin was glowing</li>
      <li>but after it was stolen, she bought the Nutra Sonic and thinks it is a better product</li>
      <li>I decided to go with this one for the price and because of another review I read that said this one has a stronger and more vigorous motor than the Clarisonic.  </li>
      <li>I was able to get out a lot of use on one charge.  </li>
      <li>, there is a Clarisonic that has more speeds as well</li>
      <li>Also, I would again suggest that you make sure you buy the product from an authorized dealer (even when they sell through Amazon) because I have heard &amp; read that many of the NS non-authorized dealers sell are refurbished ones.</li>
      <li>6 months at the most I had two and a friend of mine had one</li>
      <li>You have to make sure you register your unit</li>
      <li>1 brush&lt;br /&gt;N: 3 brush heads for each speed...</li>
      <li>After toughing it out the cystic acne mostly went away, but I never achieved breakout-free skin.  </li>
      <li>I suspect that is the issue that most people have had with the battery dying prematurely.</li>
      <li>I love the body brush in the shower.</li>
      <li>( My sister has owned hers for over 18 months without an issue (she said it still holds a charge for about 5 or more days).</li>
      <li>If I am going to spend $100 or more on an item, I do a lot of research</li>
      <li>and obviously it is a better price.</li>
      <li>, one popped up on hsn, clearly the model they used already had beautiful glowing skin...</li>
      <li>but it was very mild</li>
      <li>I should start by saying that meant that I had to buy new brushes since I borrowed the Clarisonic from my mom and the Nutra Sonic from one of my friends and it wouldn&#x27;t be a good thing to use their face brushes in addition to the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost of replacement brushes:&lt;br</li>
      <li>And, even the fine lines disappear.</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>Hers was just fine</li>
      <li>I still got to use my free shipping as a prime member and all the protections that Amazon gives buyers</li>
      <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been this smooth in years.</li>
      <li>The brush would not charge and was made of cheap plastic.  </li>
      <li>The toner and cleanser that it comes with are all natural and paraben-free with really good ingredients.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s important to charge it the full 24 hours like</li>
      <li>: I expected to like the Clarisonic better, I&#x27;ll be honest, because in spite of the fact I knew Nutra Sonic had more power, Clarisonic was pricier.</li>
      <li>The NutraSonic is not as pretty as the Clarisonic, but works just as well and is much more affordable with a longer warranty (2 years).</li>
      <li>As usual Amazon is a great place to buy from!</li>
      <li>It does clean well.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel really clean.</li>
      <li>It does clean well.</li>
      <li>and I got a full refund.</li>
      <li>The unit did a good job until it stopped working after only about 6 months.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;it has to charge a full 24hrs before the use\\&quot; after 24hrs of charging</li>
      <li>I have used the exfoliating brush twice so far and it works nicely.  </li>
      <li>I have much fewer breakouts and even those go away quickly after spending more time on them with the NutraSonic.  </li>
      <li>The NutraSonic helps tremendously.  </li>
      <li>Let me first off say that when I first seen this product advertised I was thinking like most consumers</li>
      <li>in the first use my face felt super clean</li>
      <li>this is worth it</li>
      <li>I thought to save money it would be worth a try.  </li>
      <li>, I have this problem with all of my latest rechargeable batteries so it may just be an across-the-board problem.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not writing about this though, because I didn&#x27;t try it due to the price and already knowing the power wasn&#x27;t as good as the Nutra Sonic going in.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Plus now the right side of my face has caught up with the left and is equally as smooth and clean!    </li>
      <li>First try one of the cheap knock-offs they make now from the drug stores or get the real deal at Sephora.</li>
      <li>Also if you want to use it on your body, the Nutra Sonic works with the intense clean and body brush whereas you can&#x27;t do this with the Clarisonic.</li>

      <li>I read the reviews first as I was deciding between this one and the Clarisonic.  </li>
      <li>but it was, at the time of this review, $200 more than the Nutra Sonic that does the same thing</li>
      <li>My first one stopped working after one day.</li>
      <li>Having worked in the cosmetic biz myself, I&#x27;m well aware of that</li>
      <li>they totally hold up and it has a better warranty than the Clarisonic</li>
      <li>/&gt;C: Did a far better job of cleaning than a regular scrubbing with a wash cloth and cleanser, reduced breakouts and smooth feel</li>
      <li>The pores on the left side of my face where I used the Nutra Sonic were MORE reduced, and my skin was smoother.</li>
      <li>I used it every night with the included cleanser at first before switching to a moisturizing cleanser.  </li>
      <li>they totally hold up and it has a better warranty than the Clarisonic</li>
      <li>The first one i got for my daughter as nothing seemed to be helping her acne.</li>
      <li>all these 7 months later I like it even more</li>
      <li>and you have very sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t need a deeper clean</li>

      <li>right up until I am ready to use it.  </li>
      <li>you want a sonic cleaner to begin with it: Sonic wave technology has long been proven as far more than a gimmick, though it may sound that way at first.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything I hope it would be. Works great. it&#x27;s important to charge it the full 24 hours like the instructions say. My skin hasn&#x27;t been this smooth in years. And, even the fine lines disappear. I would recommend it to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Awesome and I try use it everyday I know it works cuz in the first use my face felt super clean this is a good investment! Don&#x27;t spend $100 on other ones this is worth it</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after reading the reviews comparing this to the more expensive facial cleasing brush.  I thought to save money it would be worth a try.  It stopped working less than 2 weeks after I started to use it.  I am returning it and will likely buy the more expensive item.  I hope the seller will refund my money.    Addendum:  Payless Beauty accepted the return and I got a full refund.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my wife and she loves it.  If she new I was saying this she would kill me but anyway she had what she called bad acne but it was very mild if any at all.  Now she has been using it along with her choices of personal face soaps for about a month and her complection is completly clear.  She loves it and it definetely works.</li>
    <li> If I am going to spend $100 or more on an item, I do a lot of research and I also ask anyone I know if they have the item so I can try it out. I did that here as well.  I should start by saying that meant that I had to buy new brushes since I borrowed the Clarisonic from my mom and the Nutra Sonic from one of my friends and it wouldn&#x27;t be a good thing to use their face brushes in addition to the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost of replacement brushes:&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic (hereafter referred to as \\&quot;C\\&quot;) $25 on most sites but this varies with sales&lt;br /&gt;Nutra Sonic (hereafter referred to as \\&quot;N\\&quot;)$15 on most sites but this varies with sales&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of switching out brushes:&lt;br /&gt;C: Easy&lt;br /&gt;N: Not hard, but more difficult than the Clarisonic in comparison&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why you want a sonic cleaner to begin with it: Sonic wave technology has long been proven as far more than a gimmick, though it may sound that way at first. Sonic wavelength technology is made up of tiny vibrations that allow you to loosen dirt you could not otherwise. This is why they are used in professional toothbrushes and in the jewelry cleaner machines your jeweler uses. I own both of those items too and I can tell you there is an ENORMOUS difference from that and simply a vibrating sonic-wannabe of either.  For your face this means it cleans your pores 6 times better than you can via simply washing, reducing breakouts but also helping take away loose skin on the surface you can&#x27;t see which clogs pores and dulls skin and renewing skin reduces wrinkles. Having worked in the cosmetic biz myself, I&#x27;m well aware of that truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s get down to how they worked...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I used one for one week on one side of my face, twice per day and the other on the other side of my face twice per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonic Power:&lt;br /&gt;C 300 rotations per second&lt;br /&gt;N 400 rotations per second&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nutra Sonic was obviously stronger but I didn&#x27;t measure these rotations on my own...no way could I count that fast. The manufacturers provided these details, both to me and in their advertised specs.  This is both a good and bad thing. First, it felt like the Clarisonic only had vibration in the middle part of the brush, not all over, which didn&#x27;t make much sense to me, but suffice it to say it was just lighter on the power, Nutra Sonic truly felt like it had more power...however, that also meant there was a bit more splatter. I could use the Clarisonic standing up, facing the mirror, with no splatter. However, I used the Nutra Sonic in the shower and with my face down to the sink since the power of it sometimes splashed water droplets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, both of these models are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel:&lt;br /&gt;C Felt a bit heavier, maybe because it has heavier parts or because it has a built-in timer whereas the Nutra Sonic does not.&lt;br /&gt;N Lighter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I should add....&lt;br /&gt;Timer:&lt;br /&gt;C Built in timer so you don&#x27;t use it on any part of your face longer than a minute&lt;br /&gt;N No built in timer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speeds:&lt;br /&gt;C 1 speed, soft. Manufacturer says it&#x27;s made for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;N 4 speeds: sensitive, normal, and body brush&lt;br /&gt;(incidentally, there is a Clarisonic that has more speeds as well but it was, at the time of this review, $200 more than the Nutra Sonic that does the same thing and it still had less sonic power. That&#x27;s the Clarisonic Pro.  I&#x27;m not writing about this though, because I didn&#x27;t try it due to the price and already knowing the power wasn&#x27;t as good as the Nutra Sonic going in.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;brushes included:&lt;br /&gt;C: 1 brush&lt;br /&gt;N: 3 brush heads for each speed...if your skin is very sensitive, there is a softer brush, if you want greater exfoliation, use the harder brush at normal speed, or soften feet and elbows in the shower with the body brush on high speed. Incidentally, if I have bad breakouts I do sometimes use the high speed on my face to really exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jitter Mode:&lt;br /&gt;C: Has no Jitter Mode setting in addition to speeds&lt;br /&gt;N: Has a jitter mode setting so you can use exfoliation cleansers and pretty much get a pro exfoliation.  I prefer Mary Kay&#x27;s exfoliation cleanser because they are one of the few that uses the exact same exfoliates as dermatologists use...rather than ground peach pits or apricot pits that actually put tiny tears in your skin. Again, that&#x27;s just from me being in the biz for a few years that I know that odd fact. Olay has a good one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;both come with charging base&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;C: High&lt;br /&gt;N: Low in comparison, but nothing with decent sonic wavelength tech is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that price varies greatly both on Amazon and the internet. Do compare shipping charges as well. Usually I find everything cheaper on Amazon but in this case, for me, Amazon had a link ad on the Nutra Derm page that linked to an outside website that had the Nutra Sonic less and with free shipping so do explore around as sometimes it&#x27;s cheaper in one place and sometimes another, or sometimes it&#x27;s cheaper on one but the seller jacks up the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleansers:&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, skip the upsell for the cleansers of both models if you have the option and just buy whatever brand you like...they are just average cleaners and not worth the extra mark up for the small bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line...Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;C: Did a far better job of cleaning than a regular scrubbing with a wash cloth and cleanser, reduced breakouts and smooth feel&lt;br /&gt;N: I expected to like the Clarisonic better, I&#x27;ll be honest, because in spite of the fact I knew Nutra Sonic had more power, Clarisonic was pricier. You don&#x27;t always get what you pay for. Sometimes you simply pay for marketing. The pores on the left side of my face where I used the Nutra Sonic were MORE reduced, and my skin was smoother. I can&#x27;t say I saw a wonderful reduction in wrinkles on either side but it may also be too soon to measure that claim by both brands. I loved the exfoliation mode on the Nutra Sonic and, in all honesty, the speed difference was VERY important to me. Dermatologists exfoliate for a reason: removing the outer layer of dead skin rejuvenates your skin and prevents clogged pores which lead to acne. The soft pulse of the Clarisonic simply didn&#x27;t do this as much, although I did like it better than a wash cloth. For results, the Nutra Sonic won for me hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warranty:&lt;br /&gt;C: 1 year but ONLY if your purchase stems from the Clarisonic website.

However, if you don&#x27;t mind looking down near the sink to prevent some random water drops that Nutra Sonic sometimes slings with the greater vibrations, or you want to use it in the shower, or you want to exfoliate or have normal skin that sometimes needs a greater scrubbing (although you can still go with gentle too), I&#x27;d choose the Nutra Sonic. Also if you want to use it on your body, the Nutra Sonic works with the intense clean and body brush whereas you can&#x27;t do this with the Clarisonic.

The soft pulse of the Clarisonic simply didn&#x27;t do this as much, although I did like it better than a wash cloth. For results, the Nutra Sonic won for me hands down.

    <li> NEVER buy from FaceMedix!  My NutraSonic Cleansing System stopped working after 2 months and I ask for the product to be exchanged not for the money to be refunded.  Their response \\&quot;Unfortunately we don&#x27;t exchange or refund after 30 days\\&quot;.  Amazon&#x27;s response \\&quot;Unfortunately it&#x27;s an outside vendor &amp; that is their policy\\&quot;.  FaceMedix doesn&#x27;t stand behind their products &amp; Amazon doesn&#x27;t stand behind their vendors.  Keep your $100 dollars!  Linda Borock</li>
    <li> Let me first off say that when I first seen this product advertised I was thinking like most consumers it&#x27;s garbage so I did my research on the NutraSonic. I looked at reviews then I looked took it one step further and watched videos, one popped up on hsn, clearly the model they used already had beautiful glowing skin... \\&quot;the world of false advertising\\&quot; nevertheless I proceeded to search youtube. I watched a non-actor girl do a 10 day test of NutraSonic Face Brush System. truly seeing is believing, her skin was tore up from the basement from acne and makeup (gross) but after the 6 day most of the acne disappeared and the 10th day her skin was glowing and you could barely see any of the acne. I ordered the very next day. NutraSonic arrived 4 days later \\&quot;it has to charge a full 24hrs before the use\\&quot; after 24hrs of charging I finally tested it out for myself. AMAZING from day 1 I actually saw the glow come back to my skin, I&#x27;ve been blessed not to have suffer from severe acne, I do occasionally get dark spots from time to time. after a week of using the NutraSonic 2x a day on Normal setting I&#x27;ve seen my natural glow return and the dark spots practically fade away. Thanks NutraSonic &amp; Payless Beauty.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I noticed within a few weeks much improvement with my skin. Mainly the even tone and smaller pores. I do love how my skin feels tight and clean after I use it. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is the brushes could be easier to remove and replace. Other than that I recommend it to anyone with or without skin issues.</li>
    <li> I compared Nutra Sonic to Clarisonic for a long time before I made this purchase.  My daughter has the NutraSonic and loves it.  So I finally bought it.  At first I had a hard time switching the brushess but I just didn&#x27;t use enough pressure to put it on.  Now it&#x27;s fine.  My daughter cautioned me not to ever drop it so I&#x27;m very careful.  I use it every morning in the shower.  I have used the exfoliating brush twice so far and it works nicely.  I&#x27;ve been using the NutraSonic for probably two weeks.  I think I am charging it maybe every five days.  I used the body brush one time but I&#x27;ll probably stick with the loofah.  It takes me too long to use body the body brush and regular facial brush.  I don&#x27;t like to use that much water.  If it continues to work like it does, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The unit did a good job until it stopped working after only about 6 months.  Now I have to buy another one (different brand) of course.  So much for a savings.  I would not waste money on this faulty unit...</li>
    <li> Update on September 15-after using this for only six weeks, it malfunctioned and turned on and would not turn off. Totally dead now!  It is beyond the return date  (30 days) so I am out $90.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad-I really liked this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to try the Nutra Sonic Brush set. It did not disappoint. I am using it along with my moisturizer and emu oil, and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> This is the Third one i have Purchased. The first one i got for my daughter as nothing seemed to be helping her acne. I used it several times and finally bought one for myself. My son was home from college and was complaining about his face breaking out and nothing would help it. So I leant him mine and he loved it. So i purchased one for him also. He just left again for college and took it with him. It just makes your face feel so much cleaner and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommned this to everyone, especially if you have Teens with skin problems.</li>
    <li> The NutraSonic is not as pretty as the Clarisonic, but works just as well and is much more affordable with a longer warranty (2 years). The toner and cleanser that it comes with are all natural and paraben-free with really good ingredients.</li>
    <li> I got this second one to use in the shower. Makes your skin feel really clean. I use it with any kind of soap. I hope it keeps working well.</li>
    <li> I have a very old Makita drill whose battery charge does not last as long as it used to, but I can charge it up and use it whenever I need it without any issues.  Not so with anything I have with a newer rechargeable battery.  Today&#x27;s rechargeable batteries are a PITA.  If they ever completely discharge they are done for, which is what happened to my NutraSonic.  I bought my NutraSonic about 3 years ago via Amazon.  The first one they sent was blue so I sent it back for a white one.  That one arrived covered in the included cleanser and toner. Bah.  I plugged it in and waited for it to completely charge before using.  I used it every night with the included cleanser at first before switching to a moisturizing cleanser.  Since I turned 13 my skin has always been atrocious.  I tried every at-home remedy I found before starting with prescriptions and dermatologists.  I finally ended up on Accutane, which is as horrible as everyone says.  Your face becomes painfully dry and flaky, and you become suicidal.  After toughing it out the cystic acne mostly went away, but I never achieved breakout-free skin.  The NutraSonic helps tremendously.  After using it at night my skin actually glows.  After a month&#x27;s worth of nightly cleansing I met up with a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in that long.  She couldn&#x27;t stop saying how great I looked.  I finally had to ask her to stop saying that, but secretly I was pleased that the NutraSonic was working so well.  I have a picture from that night and my face looks great.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but your skin will definitely look smoother and thus younger.  I have much fewer breakouts and even those go away quickly after spending more time on them with the NutraSonic.  Now, the battery issue is something that you probably will face.  Before I moved and my NutraSonic discharged before I could unpack it I was able to get out a lot of use on one charge.  Now I have to leave it on the charger right up until I am ready to use it.  As previously stated, I have this problem with all of my latest rechargeable batteries so it may just be an across-the-board problem.  Definitely purchase and use religiously for an amazing results, but be aware that the battery will probably be unreliable.ed, I have this problem with all of my latest rechargeable batteries so it may just be an across-the-board problem.

    <li> I am very disappointed with this brush. Worked fantastic until it stopped and would not charge back up. I only had it for 6 wks. and have to pay for shipping to replace it because it was past 30 days! Wow! Just what I want to do after spending close to $80 for a defective product. Won&#x27;t be ordering from this company again. Yes, there is a one-year warranty, but on your dime to return.</li>
    <li> The title summarizes it. I had it for a  month. Had issues with it from very beginning, however, the customer service told me at first that they can&#x27;t exchange used product. After a month I returned it. I am still waiting for refund. Extremely disappointing, Will not use this manufacturer or seller again. No recommended.</li>
    <li> I ordered and got mine around Jan 2012.  I read the reviews first as I was deciding between this one and the Clarisonic.  I decided to go with this one for the price and because of another review I read that said this one has a stronger and more vigorous motor than the Clarisonic.  Well, it does have a good strong motor, which is what I wanted.  I bought this so that I could do major face exfoliation instead of getting professional dermabrasion.  I love it!  I think it does remove minute amounts of surface skin and leaves you with much more even skin tone, helps get rid of discoloration and evens out textures and rough spots on your face.  With frequent use, it reportedly can give the same results as professional dermabrasion and so far that seems to be the case.  I am very happy with it and I would not want to go without it.</li>
    <li> Not only did this product arrive with no manual in the first place, but it stopped charging after about twenty uses. The seller politely informed me that they can do nothing. Ninety dollars in the garbage. Don&#x27;t buy this product. First try one of the cheap knock-offs they make now from the drug stores or get the real deal at Sephora. Disappointed, since I justified the cost of this item with the need for fewer facials. Seriously, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions in the package to charge the brush before using it for the first time and it never worked properly.  It will not hold a charge, the brush runs inconsistently if at all and it was a total disappointment.</li>
    <li> The brush would not charge and was made of cheap plastic.  Would not recommend purchasing this item as it is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased one for my daughter and one for myself. Hers was just fine and she loves it. My first one stopped working after one day. I returned it and purchased another one for myself. Fabulous, It compairs to the very expensive brand at less than half the price. I love the body brush in the shower. I had very dry flakey skin on my shins and calfs....not any more. Body lotion now soaks in and my legs look great in shorts.&lt;br /&gt;The face brush has stimulated my face and now my moisturizers just melt into my skin.</li>
    <li> The machine is well build and it works really good. Pretika I stopped using because they are dead within a few months... 6 months at the most I had two and a friend of mine had one and they all stopped charging after 4-5 months&lt;br /&gt;I hope this one lasts a little longer but I have just had it for a month. I will update at a later date. For now I give it 5 stars as it is a good machine. As usual Amazon is a great place to buy from!</li>
    <li> Battery stop taking a charge after only 3 mos.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now but I can definitely say I see a difference in the size of my pores. I use this daily, in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have been back and forth for weeks on which to purchase - Nutra Sonic or the Clarisonic. The esthetician that did my last 2 facials recommended the Clarisonic but when I asked my sister (who is also a licensed esthetician but lives on the other side of the country), she recommended the Nutra Sonic. She told me that she had owned the Clarisonic but after it was stolen, she bought the Nutra Sonic and thinks it is a better product and obviously it is a better price. However, when I went to buy it there were a bunch of bad reviews about the unit dying:( My sister has owned hers for over 18 months without an issue (she said it still holds a charge for about 5 or more days). While I have been wavering, I have been trying to research the product as much as I could and what I found out is that Nutra Sonic offers a 1 year warranty on all their products - and it includes units that stop charging or stop working! I imagine you have to buy through an \\&quot;authorized dealer\\&quot; to get the warranty but what you find out with a little bit of research is that the company selling this product through Amazon IS an authorized dealer! I went to their website (buy nutra sonic - no spaces! .com) and purchased it through there - which links back to AMAZON! I still got to use my free shipping as a prime member and all the protections that Amazon gives buyers are still there! You have to make sure you register your unit though when it comes - the downfall of EVERY warranty. There is a link at the bottom of the dealers page under customer service. I felt better ordering what seems to be a superior product knowing that I am protected for a full year if I get a dud. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but I am blown away by the results! I will update my review in a few weeks/month after I have used it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the Nutra Sonic for about a month now - usually twice a day - and I still just LOVE it! I even cancelled my facial appt last week because I just didn&#x27;t see the need for it - saved $80 in the process and completely covered the cost of my Nutra Sonic! As others have stated, water does splatter around during use but I use mine in the shower in the morning and I lean into the sink or over the bath tub when I use it at night - a minor inconvenience so that I don&#x27;t have to clean the mirror when I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s worth it for the extra power I got with the Nutra Sonic over the Clarisonic. I found no difficulty in switching out the brushes at ALL (even with wet, soapy hands in the shower) so I&#x27;m not sure what to think about those comments in other reviews. I also have had great success with the battery. I charged it for 24 hours initially and have not had to charge it since! As with any rechargeable battery, you should let it completely drain after the initial charge (I&#x27;m still waiting for that to happen after one month of using it for about 3-4 minutes, twice a day) and I wouldn&#x27;t suggest that you just let the NS sit on the charging base every night even after the initial charge/drain process. I suspect that is the issue that most people have had with the battery dying prematurely. Also, I would again suggest that you make sure you buy the product from an authorized dealer (even when they sell through Amazon) because I have heard &amp; read that many of the NS non-authorized dealers sell are refurbished ones.</li>
    <li> Broke after 6 months.</li>
