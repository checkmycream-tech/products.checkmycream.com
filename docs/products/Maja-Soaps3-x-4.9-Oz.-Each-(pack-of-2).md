    <li> Excellent fast service and great product.</li>
    <li> Have ordered Maja soaps many many times over the years.  I use them for scenting the linen closet and drawers.  I put them in &amp;#34;winter&#x27;  or &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; handbags when I store them out of season.  I put them in the bag with blankets or quilts I am storing.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I ordered these Maja round soaps from Amazon, recently, and both times they smell very fresh.  I had ordered Maja rectangular soaps from a different page/ vendor on Amazon and they had little scent.  Amazon Customer Service was great and directed me to these.  The box does say made in Mexico, not Spain, but I am pleased with them.  I suppose Maja has different companies distributing and producing their soaps and scent quality may vary, or some vendors may ship old packages.  Don&#x27;t accept &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34; soap.

    <li> I LOVE this soap!  It is too bad the perfume/toilette does not smell like the soap.  This soap is fresh and engaging - you feel as if you had just received a spa treatment.

    <li> I have been using Maja soap since 1972, and have ordered it from Amazon for many years now.  This is the first complaint I have ever had.  When I unwrapped it, the color was a very light green-almost white (usually dark green).  It did NOT have the scent to Maja both in the shower and out of the shower. Is this an imitation or a defective batch of soap?  I am truly disappointed.</li>

    <li> Dad has been using this soap for years and loves it</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what we were looking for.  It has a delicate scent and the scent lasts all day long.  It leaves the skin feeling soft and supple.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better hand and body soap.</li>
    <li> While in Spain this soap was in the hotel&#x27;s we stayed in. Since 1974 I have used nothing else.  The soap is now made in Mexico and is the same wonderful quality</li>
    <li> So glad to find this soap. My mom loved it and was missing it as it is difficult to find.</li>
