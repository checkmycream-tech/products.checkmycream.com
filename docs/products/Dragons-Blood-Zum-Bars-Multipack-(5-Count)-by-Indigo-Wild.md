<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Where do I start, I love the smell of Dragons Blood. Its earthy tones are similar to that of patchouli and sandalwood. The soap leaves your skin smelling lovely for a few hours, not to mention it helps hydrate dry skin.  The only caution is that its deep color may stain your bath/shower, well worth it in my book! Definitely recommend this soap as well as the scent.</li>
    <li> this soap is awesome .smells great , feels good on the skin , works for men as well as woman . takes care of greasy complexions too .</li>
    <li> I love these bars. They smell amazing, and they deep clean everything. They&#x27;re especially good for removing oil and dirt from skin. I rub it on my face in the shower, and when the water washes it all off my skin is literally squeaky clean and you can FEEL the difference. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in these bars that does it but every time I&#x27;ve used them and dried my face afterwards they always make my blackheads and other acne very visible. Not a bad thing, just an observation. But because of that it&#x27;s easier for me to spot treat!</li>
    <li> this soap really does feel better than regular soap and body washes</li>
    <li> nice smells great and refreshing</li>
    <li> This is my personal favorite bath/shower product. I love the aroma and the quality of this product. I have purchased similar (but not this vendor brand). The others do not compare to this soap. It lasts longer, smells better and helps my dry skin. Fabulous product.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance but Zum Bars are too expensive to use everyday.</li>
    <li> I first smelled dragons blood soap at my sisters. My bro in law uses it. She gave me a bar to try. Love, love, love it! I put unused bars around house for the smell!</li>
    <li> These wonderful soaps are mulitpurpose for me. Believe it or not, one bar alone is a great closet &amp;#34;sachet&amp;#34;, I keep one in wrapped in tissue papers in the linen closet, one in my lingerie drawers and one in the coat closet.  On roadtrips, I cut the bars in half and keep them in ziplock baggies to use instead of motel soap or when camping and they are an instant refresher.</li>
    <li> The scent is wonderful. The bars desolve a little faster than store bought but the soap is nicer on the skin. I will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> The Dragonblood ZUM is just wonderful. I have horrible dry skin on my face, the DragonsBlood ZUM soap helps keep the dryness down and actually has improved my skins texture. My husband loves it too; he tends to get acne on his face and head, washing with this keeps him from any breakouts! PLUS it smells so GOOD!!</li>
    <li> We all enjoy this soap.  I have given a few away for gifts.  They smell wonderful and feel great on your skin.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT THE FRAGRANCE I WAS EXPECTINGIT SOR OF SMELLS LIKE ITS GOT CAMPHOR...NOT REFRESHING LIKE  THE DRAGONS BLOOD I EVER TRIED BEFOR..DISAPOINTED,  YEAH</li>
    <li> We can&#x27;t get enough of this soap in our household!! I would say that the scent leans more on the woodsy masculine side, but I use it just as much as my boyfriend does. It&#x27;s an addictive warm and spicy scent that you just want to keep smelling! I really wish Zum had Dragons Blood in their room freshener line, I would have a bottle in every room! But for now I&#x27;ll just keep using this soap religiously :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this soap!  The smell is so warm, exotic and spicy that you will want everything around you smelling like it!  The bars are generous in size, colorful and I truly love the fact that I am buying an awesome product, while also supporting a Fair Trade company!  Its my new favorite soap!</li>
    <li> I found the scent unbearable and so did the rest of our family. I love the scent of patchouli and sandalwood and other woodsy, incense type aromas. This smells like rancid men&#x27;s cologne to me. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what but it was a costly mistake. I could not give it away. It made my skin feel wonderful but I could not tolerate the odor.</li>
    <li> in addition to a great, unique fragrance and help for dry skin, we have found this bar helps heal bruises so they don&#x27;t turn black and blue,  and it helps eliminate red back-of-the-arms skin</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! Very gentle for the skin too.</li>
