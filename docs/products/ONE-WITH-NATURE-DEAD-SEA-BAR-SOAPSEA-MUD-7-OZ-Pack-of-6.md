      <li>Yes, it can be abrasive, but if you don&#x27;t scrub your skin like you&#x27;re sanding wood, you should be fine.</li>
      <li>, I highly recommend this soap, you will love it too!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
      <li>it makes your skin squicky clean.  </li>
      <li>Rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>So far i have been using it for 4 days and my face feels so smooth and no clogged pores!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;d leave for bit, but sure enough my forehead would be filled with more pimples.</li>

      <li>you may be affended about the smell at first</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s so worth it after wasting my money on stuff that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
      <li>it is a double whammy of natural ingredients and a second to none exfoliation that keeps my skin looking, smelling, and  feeling great.</li>
      <li>No nasty smelling perfumes or other odors.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much for such quick service.</li>
      <li>but as I got older i noticed i started getting an oily skin and clogged pores.(gross</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s one of the more affordable (at least right now)</li>
      <li>I recommend this soap highly.</li>
      <li>Rinses off easily in the shower unlike some of that goopy stuff like Dove and other lotions that claim to be soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only one that I can use multiple times per day without any fear of it drying out my skin and still gets me clean.</li>
      <li>It was shipped very quickly thank god because it is very hard to find in stores, and the price was right too.</li>
      <li>I have perpetually dry, bumpy skin and this smoothes it right out.</li>
      <li>So far, it hasn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now.</li>
      <li>I like to use natural products, and use this soap guilt-free.</li>
      <li>Dead Sea mud-based soaps available.</li>
      <li>It leaves such a clean and refreshing feeling, that it is hard to use any other soap after using this soap.  </li>
      <li>The simplicity and purity of ingredients, combined with the mild and pleasing feeling they leave your skin with (not harsh or drying), makes these soaps - specifically this one and the Dead Sea Salt version -</li>
      <li>I tried the soap, not really expecting much, and wow, was I pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>To buy the single bar, has gotten very costly, but when I ran across the multi-bar offer, I did not hesitate, I jumped at the offer.  </li>
      <li>This soap is very mild and non irritating if you have skin problems.</li>

    <li> Do you have dry skin, rashes, other skin problems?  I recommend this soap highly.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m a soap fanatic. I have tried multiple brands and types of soaps but always come back to this one(One With Nature, Dead Sea Mud Soap). Yes, it can be abrasive, but if you don&#x27;t scrub your skin like you&#x27;re sanding wood, you should be fine. It contains minerals and Dead Sea mud -- it&#x27;s exfoliating by nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price, it&#x27;s one of the more affordable (at least right now) Dead Sea mud-based soaps available. Bonus? It&#x27;s great for your skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome ! Great man soap . It has little pebbles in it ... And helps my eczema.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff- great price compared to most organic grocers, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> i use this product all the time when i can find it. it makes your skin squicky clean.  you may be affended about the smell at first but as you use it you don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
    <li> Love the efficacy of this soap.</li>
    <li> I never had issues with my skin but as I got older i noticed i started getting an oily skin and clogged pores.(gross) anywho... I bought this soap at my local supermarket for 5 bucks. Well the very first day i used i felt the difference in my skin! I love it! So far i have been using it for 4 days and my face feels so smooth and no clogged pores!! Will be definitely keep on using this soap.</li>
    <li> Having acne from childhood well into adulthood I have tried just about every product on the market, with very few positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is cheap, the salt grains exfoliate my face very well, it leaves my skin clean and balanced, I don&#x27;t even need moisturizer after using this soap. I only use this on my face, so a bar lasts me about two months, and the product is always consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> My very favorite soap of all time. I have perpetually dry, bumpy skin and this smoothes it right out.</li>
    <li> I will not buy another soap.</li>
    <li> The simplicity and purity of ingredients, combined with the mild and pleasing feeling they leave your skin with (not harsh or drying), makes these soaps - specifically this one and the Dead Sea Salt version - my favorites ever. Been using them for the last few years and have no desire to try something different. Plus, the bars are nicely substantial and last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting some via Subscribe &amp; Save, until Amazon stopped offering the soap that way - please make these available that way again!</li>
    <li> This soap is great!  Even James loves it!  It leaves such a clean and refreshing feeling, that it is hard to use any other soap after using this soap.  To buy the single bar, has gotten very costly, but when I ran across the multi-bar offer, I did not hesitate, I jumped at the offer.  I have bought the single bar from Amazon in the past, but it has become much more expensive over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I highly recommend this soap, you will love it too!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. A few months ago my mother bought this soap from a friend that sells different beauty products and passed it on to me in the hopes that it would help me with my facial acne. I&#x27;d been having annoying acne on my forehead and chin area for months without anything really helping. It&#x27;d leave for bit, but sure enough my forehead would be filled with more pimples. I tried the soap, not really expecting much, and wow, was I pleasantly surprised. Within two weeks or so, my face completely cleared up, more so than i&#x27;d seen it in MONTHS. The best part is that it stayed clear, because I was so ready for my acne to come back. So far, it hasn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now. I still use at on my face at least once a day and I also use it as a body soap, and it makes my skin feel great. Follow it up with a moisturizer and you&#x27;re set for your acne treatment. I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s so worth it after wasting my money on stuff that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I love mud soaps. I use them for my face and body. Good price and good quality for me</li>
    <li> I like to use natural products, and use this soap guilt-free. It has a nice scrubbing, cleansing feel.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap for me. It&#x27;s the only one that I can use multiple times per day without any fear of it drying out my skin and still gets me clean. Rinses off easily in the shower unlike some of that goopy stuff like Dove and other lotions that claim to be soap.</li>
    <li> dead sea mud uses natural ingredients, no harmful chemicals. the mud in dead sea mud are little chunks of mud that exfoliate the skin. it is a double whammy of natural ingredients and a second to none exfoliation that keeps my skin looking, smelling, and  feeling great.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap, really love it.  The salt helps to scrub away dirty.  No nasty smelling perfumes or other odors.  Rinses clean.  I am hooked on this soap.</li>
