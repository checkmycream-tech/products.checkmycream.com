      <li>Gillette products are really very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the &amp;#34;intense cooling&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>My son uses this and really likes it</li>
      <li>read many reviews before buying this one, and I saw one review saying its sticky, which is certainly not the case.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought it for my boyfriend. He liked it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the tingly feeling I get when I use this product. It&#x27;s smells so good and makes my skin sing.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing quick absorbing aftershave lotion. Fresh and soothing at the same time. Also a very nice but faint scent. So don&#x27;t be afraid to add your favorite cologne afterwards. Unlike Nivea, Neutrogena and some others I&#x27;ve tried, this won&#x27;t leave your face feeling like you just coated it with lotion.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Very soothing and smells great without being too strong. perfect size for locker/travel etc. will buy more!</li>
    <li> I have been using this aftershave lotion for the past 6 months and I totally adore it. I used to dread at the thought of shaving before because of the painful bumps i used to develop on my face, no matter how careful i&#x27;d be but not anymore. This lotion give a real cooling sensation and leaves your skin intact, even if you accidentally have  cuts. its also a moisturizer so u wont be  left with a dry skin after a few hours. the only drawback is the price for the amount u can buy. it gets over real fast so you have to keep buying frequently but anyways the product is A1. Must have for all men!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette fusion after shave for a long time (the orange bottle). I ordered a 2 pack of this to give it a try. MUCH better than the orange stuff. It feels like regular lotion when you put it on but after a few seconds you can really feel the cooling effect kick in. It feels great after a shave and really soothes my skin. The cooling effect works really well and I think feels great on your skin.</li>
    <li> My son uses this an like it very much.I bought it here as it is much cheaper for the 2Pack then where he was buying it.So if you use this product buy it here an save.I will reorder it again when he needs more.Hope this helps anyone who uses this kind of product.</li>
    <li> I was a big fan of the \\&quot;old\\&quot; line of Fusion after shave lotions, particularly the one that was alcohol free for sensitive skin. This new version lists alcohol as the #2 ingredient! So that cooling affect some claim is the alcohol reacting to your skin. Skin doesn&#x27;t need alcohol. Very dissapointed that Gillette changed around the Fusion line. I did try this new line and it irritated my skin pretty quickly. Not a good product for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this aftershave lotion. I&#x27;ve tried others that are basically a liquid you have to splotch on your skin after shaving, but this has a good consistency. Sure, it&#x27;s probably made with a bunch of chemicals, but it works pretty well actually at lessening the sting and moisturizing. Overall, I&#x27;ve bought it plenty of times and it&#x27;s a good value, but I&#x27;m willing to try other products.</li>
    <li> I love this product, use it everytime I shave.  Leaves my skin refreshed and has a nice scent.  Not oily, absorbs really quick</li>
    <li> Had to replace the old version of this that i really like with this. Don&#x27;t know why they discontinued the old version as i loved it, but this is also really nice and i buy them 3 at a time. Does not sting and does not have an overpowering smell. I feel that it is just right and am liking it more each time i use it.</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in the stores!  I like the soothing results on my face when using it.</li>
    <li> i usually buy this at my preferred stores  always expensive but this time approximately half even after shipping  a win for me!!</li>
    <li> I use this product after I shave it is awesome. You can not beat the quality at this price. I would recommend this product to men everywhere.</li>
    <li> Its good and reached less than the given time. It works well on the oily skin when combined with shaving gel.</li>
    <li> Amazon has a good price on this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product has a very good non-alcohol non-harsh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intense cooling effect is the best I have ever felt.</li>
    <li> I love this aftershave. I have very sensitive skin and I am African-American. This  product has been very effective in reducing shave bumps. I am very delighted with this product and recommended it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This Gillette aftershave has an excellent essence and keeps your face very fresh after a couple of hours. However, the main reason it is not a five stars is because it makes your skin very irritated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with nasty bumps after I shave. Thankfully, this lotion greatly decreases the dryness and bumps that occur after I shave. Not only that, but it smells great as well!</li>
    <li> Not much to say, other than I like the way it feels.&lt;br /&gt;Contains alcohol, so it&#x27;ll sting a bit, but the cool feeling after is worth it. The sensation lasts 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Can be pretty expensive though, if it&#x27;s not on sale.</li>
    <li> GILLETTE is gillett. It make good cooling effect. good work with  my skin. I use it everyday.  need very small peace. have good price.</li>
    <li> It has a strong scent, which I liked. If you don&#x27;t like strong scent or if you would rather go with your favorite perfume scent, avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on Ingredients and effect. ( this is just to make you aware if you are interested)&lt;br /&gt;It lists the following ingredients as of April 2013: Water, Alcohol Denat, Glycerine, Cerapryl Isononanoate, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Fragrance, Menthyl Lactate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, DMDM Hydantoin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Menthol, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbmate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It has menthol in it (which is found in mint leaves). It gives the cooling sensation to the skin nerve ending. Menthol does not do any firming/tightening of skin. It just give you the cooling effect. All right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Panthenol moisturizes/hydrates the skin and helps healing cuts. Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It has ethanol it it. It does sting harsh for a minute.  But nothing too bad. May be it&#x27;s good in the morning to get an awakening kick?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Dimethicone is dimethyl silicon (silioxane) polymer. It makes a good smooth gliding feeling of the product over the skin. Apparently, dimethicone also form a &#x27;protective barrier&#x27; on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative opinion is that it forms an artificial plastic-like barrier on the skin which would prevent the normal &#x27;breathing&#x27; of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone is present in some anti-foaming over-the-counter anti-gas drugs. Interestingly, it is also used in processed fast foods like McDonald&#x27;s Chicken McNuggets and Wendy&#x27;s French fries!! Not a good feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) DMDM Hydantoin is used as preservative in this formula. It release formaldehyde (HCHO) which exerts it preservative effect.  Do a Google search for &amp;#34;Formaldehyde and Cancer Risk&amp;#34; and you will reach cancer.gov fact sheet on formaldehyde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified formaldehyde as a probable human carcinogen under conditions of unusually high or prolonged exposure&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DMDM Hydantoin releases only minimal amount of formaldehyde,  (but sufficient to kill microorganisms like bacteria and mold). It should be usually safe for topical use in humans at the concentration used in cosmetics. But it may cause allergic contact dermatitis to sensitive population. Read more on this article from Mayo Clinic researchers,  if you are interested&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Allergic contact dermatitis to preservatives&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Dermatol Nurs. 2006 Apr;18(2):130-6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I think this product is okay.  I would be glad if they formulate a product with less preservatives even if it gets only short shelf life.  I&#x27;m not sure whether I could recommend this product. I might look for a better product in future.</li>
    <li> Got this a long time ago on sale at the grocer. Loved it and was happy to find it again on sale here.</li>
    <li> I really like this cooling lotion. I tend to break out with lotion after shave and this one was no exception although I did get four days with this product rather than none. I currently use it every two to three days to avoid breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;The breaking out is a me problem, not a product issue. I only include it for anyone with a similar condition.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest but does provide for cooling after a shave. I do not think I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a wide variety of after shave products and this is by far my favorite.  It has a cool and soothing feeling and feels great in the morning before I head out to work.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much facial hair so I don&#x27;t shave much, so I think I can last about half a year with what I got.&lt;br /&gt;When applied, this will really cool your skin and calm any burning feeling you have after shaving. You really don&#x27;t need much either. Size of one pea will fulfill what this is made of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, be aware, your face will be freezing much more when you go out to work in a really cold winter morning.</li>
    <li> Best after shave lotion ever, cools my face, moisturizes and keeps me from getting ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> My son uses this and really likes it</li>
    <li> My face has healed a lot using this product. I&#x27;ve dealt with eczema and Rosaca for years and this stuff is not irritating and my skin is actually healing up. I was leery of alchohol at first but if anything, I think its helping shrink my pores, kind of like the sting of an aftershave (which is pores closing) followed by an emollient. I have used this on a few scaly patches on my scalp and those stopped itching and are healing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many lotions and aftershaves in the past to help with razor burn from shaving my head.  This one does the trick.  I do not really smell any strong scent when using this product.  It has reduced shave bumps/redness and it feels great when applied after shaving.  The cooling sensation is there and its perfect.  Its not too cool and you don&#x27;t get the feeling like its not cool enough.  It&#x27;s just right and doesn&#x27;t last forever.  My skin was also noticeably smoother after about a weeks use.  Would reccommend and would definately buy again.</li>
    <li> I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ITS QUALITY AND PRICE ( Fusion ProSeries Men&#x27;s Intense Cooling Aftershave )...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS RATING</li>
    <li> Very effective aftershave product. Soothes and smooths the face and always gives me the desired result. I will highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the smell of this. I like the soothing effect also, and have taken to using it even on days I don&#x27;t shave. I&#x27;m afraid this qualifies as some sort of addiction.</li>
    <li> The price is good but I have sensitive skin and will be sticking with the Gillette sensitive skin gel which is the blue gel.&lt;br /&gt;I had skin irritation after using this one but I get that from many aftershaves.</li>
    <li> Gillette products are really very good.&lt;br /&gt;I read many reviews before buying this one, and I saw one review saying its sticky, which is certainly not the case.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is really very good as aftershave lotion.</li>
    <li> An aftershave that won&#x27;t attempt to harm your face as much as the razor did. There&#x27;s this cooling sensation accompanying the application of this product (as evidenced in the name) that is quite pleasant. It is a bit persistent, though. Only use a tiny amount and expect it to stay on your face for a while (I guess to protect the pores?).</li>
    <li> MAKE your shave enjoyable</li>
    <li> better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick and does its job nicely I would recommend this to anyone who shaves</li>
    <li> Its good for about a minute or so, then the overwhelming smell kicks in.  The cooling sensation is nice but the scent gave me a massive headache.</li>
    <li> if wear and tear that our face gets by warm and cold weather wasn&#x60;t enough ,We men are blessed with use of razors and Shavers that keep scratching epidermis of skin.We as men follow \\&quot;Like father like son \\&quot; strategy and use  same after shaves that daddy and grand daddy used but times been changed and This is product for icy cool and feeling fresh touch .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She will like it the way you feel ,I guarantee that</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just barely three stars...actually closer to 2.5...scent is nearly none existent and it does leave my face feeling slightly oily...can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the &amp;#34;intense cooling&amp;#34; action they advertise...it&#x27;s a good work around...but nothing special</li>
    <li> it feels very cool and fresh. i used the gel type after share - and initially i was reluctant to use a white lotion to replace it. but this product was a surprise. it is good!! it doesnt leave any sticky residue or any unwanted fragrance.</li>
    <li> Keeps me cool after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit strong to the nose. The price was great I can&#x27;t complain at all.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the way it makes his face feel after shaving and the smell is very nice.  As good as any maybe even better...........</li>
    <li> Again, replacing another product I have used for years as I am running low on what I do have. I always get this brand because it seems like a really great product to me.</li>
