      <li>The new product is perfect and works great.</li>
      <li>I take very good care of my skin, and spend money to make sure my skin looks, and feels healthy.</li>
      <li>This is amazing.</li>
      <li>However, the Goji Peel is amazing.</li>
      <li>It is kind of like an ANTIFREEZE.</li>
      <li>I really liked it and went on line to reorder after it ran out.</li>
      <li>so the peel was warm..</li>
      <li>Once nice thing was it was 104 degrees out the day it came</li>
      <li>Excellent product - highly recommend -</li>
      <li>The first one I bought at the mall works great.</li>
      <li>I use it all the time; a fine product!</li>
      <li>I have found much better results by letting it sit on my face until it has turned from a cream to a type of liquid.</li>
      <li>I love the Goji Peel I bought at the mall, it worked well and lasted for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am pleased to find it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
      <li>but I am so glad I have  invested the $40 on  this product.</li>
      <li>(more glowy).</li>
      <li>Ok, so I read the reviews and took a chance on this product.</li>
      <li>Having been pleased with the product I purchased in the mall</li>
      <li>and she fell in love immediately.</li>
      <li>I decided to purchase it through Amazon and was satisfied.</li>
      <li>and I will continue to purchase more.</li>
      <li>I kept rubbing and more gunk started coming up.</li>
      <li>This \\&quot;peel\\&quot; smells wonderfully citrus-y and leaves your skin super soft and moist.  </li>
      <li>This does make your skin appear much smoother after use, probably more effective than any lotion on the market.</li>
      <li>Save your box until you feel comfortable with how to use it, as the directions are not on the jar.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a great product that I bought some for my mom for Christmas</li>
      <li>The best part is that you really only need a \\&quot;dab\\&quot; of the peel to really exfoliate the skin</li>
      <li>that I normally do and use my  favorite face lotion  and just add this product in my routine, and it worked!    </li>
      <li>I honestly thought about getting back online and ordering 5 more</li>
      <li>(I had been outside with my grandkids swimming the week before and had gotten a light sunburn) and the wrinkles around my eyes looked much better!  </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly, and of course I had to try it out.</li>
      <li>When I washed off the peel, my face was soft, the skin looked more even,</li>
      <li>When I put it on my face it turned into some kind of glue like substance that adhered to my facial hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been 3 months now  since I  have used this product and my skin is finally clear of acne that i could not get rid of for so many years.</li>
      <li>This is definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>Here are eight more less than sincere words.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product at a mall after being approached by a salesperson.</li>
      <li>I actually  took this risk  to try this product, because the guy selling it was  convincing me</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>In fact, not only  is it cleared but even my skin tone became more even.</li>
      <li>I first tried this product at the mall.  </li>
      <li>It is creamy, which at first made me wonder how it could exfolliate.</li>
      <li>My skin actually has a nice soft glow to it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering what kind of chemical it contains that is so powerful that it can remove dead skin.</li>
      <li>I just wish that other products in this line that are available were available to be shipped to my area in Canada</li>
      <li>When I first put it on and start to gently scrub, nothing seems to be happening.</li>
      <li>I have pretty much the whole collection of Humalayan products.</li>
      <li>I used up the whole thing that he gave me and it did not work.</li>
      <li>It really does work, I have combination skin</li>
      <li>They work very well</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recomend this seller and product.</li>
      <li>and I am really displeased.</li>
      <li>This product that I just bought does not work the same and after applying it to my face it does not quite exfoliate like the original.  </li>
      <li>At first I was very hesistant to try this product but the seller explained to me  about my skin problem and told me that it would  clear  up my acne.</li>
      <li>Perhaps this is older product that has changed with time, which would explain the reduced price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>reviewer Chris above, I found that the peel stuck to my facial hair, even after many attempts to rinse it off with water and then tried to and rub it off with a washcloths.</li>
      <li>I have decent skin for a person my age.</li>
      <li>I received another  high end product as a christmas  gift from my brother and I told him immediately it wasnt going to work on my skin.</li>
      <li>the peel material will change consistency from a creamy texture to one that is more aqueous and along with it, the dead skin will start sloughing off.  </li>
      <li>However, after using this product once a week for 3 weeks, I started receiving compliments on my skin from people right and left.</li>
      <li>But i contacted the seller and they immediately sent me new product.</li>
      <li>but I was skeptical because I have bought so many facial products and ended up wasting most of it.</li>
      <li>The funny thing  is just last year</li>
      <li>I really noticed a big difference in my skin after using this product, I also had a coworker that noticed the improvement in my skin</li>
      <li>I believe the supplier was selling old products.</li>
      <li>So then I found this same product here at amazon.com and was amazed that the price was so much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>and  my skin can be sensitive as well</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve bought this product before for $50 at the Westfield Mall and was excited to see it on Amazon for the much lesser price.</li>
      <li>My skin is normal with dry areas around my eyes.</li>
      <li>The other two doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
      <li>But then all at once, dry skin starts to  slough off and by the end, my skin feels absolutely new.</li>
      <li>When you apply it to your skin the first time, you will see alot of dead skin peeling off.</li>
      <li>Actually, that line  only made my skin worse and it made my acne even more noticable.    </li>

<li> I tried to pick it all off and to my dismay found several small globs even the next</li>
<li> Being the 2nd ingredient of this product is not cool.</li>
<li> However, the Goji peel actually does rub away your dead skin.</li>
<li> It does not peel at all, a total waste of time and money.</li>
<li> Well, the 2nd ingredient to this GOJI PEEL is BUTYLENE GLYCOL AKA PROPYLENE GLYCOL, which is used in some cosmetic companies but very little amount.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> \\&quot;cosmetic4less\\&quot; is selling fake product, using the original product packaging.  This fake product doesn&#x27;t work at all, smells bad, and is worth $0.  The \\&quot;real\\&quot; product works well and has a pleasant  smell.</li>
    <li> Thought I got scammed after I bought it from a booth at the Westfield Mall. I bought this along with the Body Butter and the Rubbing Sugar or whatever it was called by the same company. The other two doesn&#x27;t seem to do much. However, the Goji peel actually does rub away your dead skin. When you apply it to your skin the first time, you will see alot of dead skin peeling off. If you apply it subsequently on the same day, you will not find any dead skin peeling off. This does make your skin appear much smoother after use, probably more effective than any lotion on the market. However, although the ingredient list shows only natural ingredients, I&#x27;m doubtful. I&#x27;m wondering what kind of chemical it contains that is so powerful that it can remove dead skin. I hope it is not toxic. Also, the cream is white in color, whereas goji is red. I don&#x27;t even think the product contains any goji at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - highly recommend - I&#x27;ve been getting rave reviews on how good my skin looks since using it ... amazing!</li>
    <li> I brought this product over at their little cart in the mall in San Diego. At first I was very hesistant to try this product but the seller explained to me  about my skin problem and told me that it would  clear  up my acne. Quite honesty, my acne problem has not gone away for like 7-8 years. The funny thing  is just last year I received another  high end product as a christmas  gift from my brother and I told him immediately it wasnt going to work on my skin. I used up the whole thing that he gave me and it did not work. Actually, that line  only made my skin worse and it made my acne even more noticable.    I actually  took this risk  to try this product, because the guy selling it was  convincing me that if I don&#x27;t get results in  30 days  doing it just once a week that  I  could return it for a  refund.  He didnt sell me   any other  product on this line, all he did was explain to me to  do my daily rountine  that I normally do and use my  favorite face lotion  and just add this product in my routine, and it worked!    The first  month I was getting results already as I noticed my acne was  going away slowly and my skin was actually softer.   It&#x27;s been 3 months now  since I  have used this product and my skin is finally clear of acne that i could not get rid of for so many years. In fact, not only  is it cleared but even my skin tone became more even. My skin actually has a nice soft glow to it. I no longer have the redness on my skin that I did before I used this product. It&#x27;s actually an amazing product!    If youre having  acne problems try this product! It really does work, I have combination skin and  my skin can be sensitive as well but I am so glad I have  invested the $40 on  this product. It is definitely money well spent! And i will continue to invest in this product when I run out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a booth in a mall. When I got home I googled it and found it here for a lot less, however upon a closer look I found out that the ingredients were not the same! Packaging looks the same, but compare the ingredients!! The original works wonderful..</li>
    <li> Having been pleased with the product I purchased in the mall I decided to purchase it through Amazon and was satisfied. I ran out of that supply and purchased some a second time through Amazon and I am really displeased. The product looked different and felt different and didn&#x27;t exfoliate like the previously used products. I believe the supplier was selling old products. I am going to try to get a replacement for the ones I didn&#x27;t open or my money back.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve bought this product before for $50 at the Westfield Mall and was excited to see it on Amazon for the much lesser price. I love the Goji Peel I bought at the mall, it worked well and lasted for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT, on the other hand, was completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like reviewer Chris above, I found that the peel stuck to my facial hair, even after many attempts to rinse it off with water and then tried to and rub it off with a washcloths. It felt like some sort of glue. I tried to pick it all off and to my dismay found several small globs even the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it is with this product. Perhaps this is older product that has changed with time, which would explain the reduced price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never written a negative review. But I have to say that I&#x27;m shocked by the performance of this product. BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I first tried this product at the mall.  Was amazed with the exfoliation process on the spot and my skin felt cleaner/softer after so I purchased it and had been very happy with the results.  So then I found this same product here at amazon.com and was amazed that the price was so much cheaper.  But the product is not quite the same.  I think another reviewer has had the same experience.  This product that I just bought does not work the same and after applying it to my face it does not quite exfoliate like the original.  I would not buy this product again from here.</li>
    <li> So, I walked by SF Westfield mall the other day to go to Wet Seal and was approached by these guys that worked for Secret of the Himayalans. Anyway I tried it, and to be honest, it felt good but I was skeptical because I have bought so many facial products and ended up wasting most of it. I went on the website to check the ingredients. The guy said all the ingredients are \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot; and NON IRRITATING!! he also told me that SUNSCREEN IS A CHEMICAL AND I DON&#x27;T NEED SUNSCREEN IF I USE THEIR PRODUCTS! Well, the 2nd ingredient to this GOJI PEEL is BUTYLENE GLYCOL AKA PROPYLENE GLYCOL, which is used in some cosmetic companies but very little amount. It is kind of like an ANTIFREEZE. Being the 2nd ingredient of this product is not cool. Propylene glycol is actually a skin irritant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I read the reviews and took a chance on this product. It arrived quickly, and of course I had to try it out. I take very good care of my skin, and spend money to make sure my skin looks, and feels healthy. This is amazing. It is creamy, which at first made me wonder how it could exfolliate. Anyway, I followed the directions on the box. Once nice thing was it was 104 degrees out the day it came so the peel was warm.. Yum! As I rubbed it in, white stuff started coming up as I rubbed. What in the world??? I kept rubbing and more gunk started coming up. I can&#x27;t decide if it was the product or dead skin like the product says it is. When I washed off the peel, my face was soft, the skin looked more even, (I had been outside with my grandkids swimming the week before and had gotten a light sunburn) and the wrinkles around my eyes looked much better!  I followed the peel with the eye serum, and the anti aging cream and felt like I had died and gone to heaven! I didn&#x27;t even put on makeup to go to the grocery store. I honestly thought about getting back online and ordering 5 more so I wouldn&#x27;t run out.. Save your box until you feel comfortable with how to use it, as the directions are not on the jar. It only takes a little..about the size of a quarter, so it will last awhile. I am 53, white, female. My skin is normal with dry areas around my eyes. Even after 8 hours my skin felt and looked great.    Udate: The directions say to start immediatly to rub into your skin. I have found much better results by letting it sit on my face until it has turned from a cream to a type of liquid. Once it is liquid, I rub in circles around my face and I have wonderful results. I can tell when it is time to wash off just by how the liquid feels and the amount of dry skin that comes off.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;peel\\&quot; smells wonderfully citrus-y and leaves your skin super soft and moist.  The best part is that you really only need a \\&quot;dab\\&quot; of the peel to really exfoliate the skin and there&#x27;s no irritation after cleaning.  To use, simply put a small amount on your face and rub, rub, rub...the peel material will change consistency from a creamy texture to one that is more aqueous and along with it, the dead skin will start sloughing off.  I use it once a week and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I really noticed a big difference in my skin after using this product, I also had a coworker that noticed the improvement in my skin (more glowy). I could notice the glow fading if I didn&#x27;t continuously use the product. It&#x27;s a shame that it has parabens, so I have moved on.</li>
    <li> I have decent skin for a person my age. However, after using this product once a week for 3 weeks, I started receiving compliments on my skin from people right and left. To use it, you wash your face, apply a thin layer of the peel and wait for about 30 seconds. It starts to feel watery and then you rub your face with your hands for a minute or two. The peel exfoliates your skin without the abrasiveness of other exfoliants. It&#x27;s such a great product that I bought some for my mom for Christmas and she fell in love immediately. This is definitely worth a try. One jar of it should last close to a year--if you use it once a week.</li>
    <li> I bought the The Secret of the Himalayan Goji Peel in a shopping mall in San Diego. I got two other products from them, but they both were fairly ordinary and overpriced. However, the Goji Peel is amazing. When I first put it on and start to gently scrub, nothing seems to be happening. But then all at once, dry skin starts to  slough off and by the end, my skin feels absolutely new. It cost $99 in the mall, but the jar lasted two years. I am pleased to find it cheaper on Amazon. I hope it is as good.</li>
    <li> The first time i ordered this product, it was not good... i dont know why. But i contacted the seller and they immediately sent me new product. The new product is perfect and works great. I would absolutely recomend this seller and product.</li>
    <li> The first one I bought at the mall works great. However, the one I purchased here at Amazon is fake. It does not peel at all, a total waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Mixing olive oil and sugar has the same effect to your skin as the rather expensive The Secret of The Himalayan Hunza Apricot Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I used it a couple of years ago and then I stored it in a plastic bag (the lid was leaking) and now it has dried out. I dont know how I can liquify it maybe I use olive oil.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product at a mall after being approached by a salesperson. I really liked it and went on line to reorder after it ran out. I have used it for about 2 years without problem. 2 months or so ago I ordered again. The product smelled a little different but looked the same. When I put it on my face it turned into some kind of glue like substance that adhered to my facial hair and I couldn&#x27;t wash it off and ended  up shaving it off YIKES. When I called the phone number for secret of the Himalayas line of cosmetics, the person there said they had never heard of it happening before. He also said that the product is distributed by different manufacturers so they would be the ones at fault. Getting on line I read that an ingredient in the product is similar to antifreeze or something like that. Needless to say I am not using it anymore .</li>
    <li> I have pretty much the whole collection of Humalayan products. They work very well and I will continue to purchase more.</li>
    <li> This is a very good price on an extremely good product.  I just wish that other products in this line that are available were available to be shipped to my area in Canada</li>
    <li> Just wonderful! I use it all the time; a fine product! Thanks! Here are eight more less than sincere words.</li>
