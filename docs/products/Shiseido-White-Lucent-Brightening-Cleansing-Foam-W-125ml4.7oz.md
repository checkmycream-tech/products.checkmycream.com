      <li>I love this product.</li>

      <li>I will order this prolduct again for sure.</li>
      <li>My favorite cleanser.  </li>
      <li>It is very rich.</li>

      <li>Refreshing clean feeling.</li>
      <li>the face wash is very mild w/o any strong scents or greasy creaminess.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>Perfect for uneven and aging skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is so sensitive and this product is still good on me.</li>
      <li>Also great because you only need a pea-sized amount for the entire face, good quality stuff.</li>
      <li>so I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes in my skin, but I will defiantly make updates to my review as needed.</li>
      <li>If you have naturally oily skin, like me, this does a great job of giving your face that very fresh/clean/no-more-oil feeling if you get what I&#x27;m saying.</li>
      <li>Shiseido White Lucent Brightening Cleansing Foam is a product that I read about, decided to give it a try, and loved it.</li>
      <li>This is a creamy cleanser that leaves your skin super clean without drying.</li>
      <li>I stopped for a a couple of weeks at one time to try another brand, and noticed my skin was not as clear and bright as it used to be, so I switched back.</li>
      <li>I tried this he first time while shopping in Ny City on tour with a dear friend in Macy&#x27;s in the city during the holidays.  </li>
      <li>only buying this one from now on! :)</li>
      <li>I have been used it for more than 4 months and this is my second one.</li>
      <li>The surface texture is soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>If you just want clean, clear skin and don&#x27;t have to worry about aging spots or freckles, try Shiseido&#x27;s Beneficiance line.</li>
      <li>Would get 5 stars if it was a little more affordable!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than using $2 soap, I guess since it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
      <li>and I have super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Less then a pea amount is enough to create the most luxurious foam to clean your entire face and neck and the both feel incredibly smooth with just a quick rinse.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the fast delivery.</li>
      <li>fast shipping</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very creamy</li>
      <li>It does not remove makeup very well.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed my skin changing</li>
      <li>Loving this product and using it everyday.  </li>
      <li>I tried all my many name and off brand other products</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about it&#x27;s brightning capabilities, but over all I love this cleanser!</li>
      <li>I think this is the only cleanser that I bought so far that does deep cleansing and still good on my sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only product that makes my face squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>and now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>In my 45 years, I have never used such a fantastic facial wash.</li>
      <li>Makes skin very soft.</li>
      <li>I like the way my skins looks after using this product, &amp; so soft.</li>
      <li>I recommend the whole White Lucent line, as well.</li>
      <li>Gives me a soft natural glow,  cleanes so well without stripping.</li>
      <li>I think it might irritate those with sensitive skin because of the formula used to lighten aging spots and freckles.</li>
      <li>Skin feels so soft after each wash.</li>
      <li>So far this product has not whitened my skin much but it hasn&#x27;t been very long yet.  </li>
      <li>First off, got this is a gift from my boyfriend&#x27;s sister along with two other shisheido items.</li>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed my skin changing but I like the way it feels. And you only need a very small amount and it will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> First off, got this is a gift from my boyfriend&#x27;s sister along with two other shisheido items. Due to the price range in these, I&#x27;ll be sticking with my regular drugstore cleanser after I finish this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I love this cleanser! It&#x27;s smooth and creamy. It cleanses well and a little goes a long way. The packaging is lovely to look at, and this item makes my sink look fancy just by sitting there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about it&#x27;s brightning capabilities, but over all I love this cleanser! Just wish it were more affordable!</li>
    <li> So far this product has not whitened my skin much but it hasn&#x27;t been very long yet.  It feels very nice on my skin though.</li>
    <li> I tried this he first time while shopping in Ny City on tour with a dear friend in Macy&#x27;s in the city during the holidays.  I tried all my many name and off brand other products and this is the one I come back to each time.  Gives me a soft natural glow,  cleanes so well without stripping. Love this cleanser and now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews of this product, and people have cautioned it causes breakout. Not sure if they should be believed because each skin is different, I decided to give it a try. Now I have more breakout than ever. I will return the product tomorrow. I should have listened to other people&#x27;s reviews and warnings. I don&#x27;t recommend the product if you have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I have been used it for more than 4 months and this is my second one. It is very nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> This cleansing form works</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the brightening effect, but nonetheless i love this product a lot. My skin is so sensitive and this product is still good on me. I think this is the only cleanser that I bought so far that does deep cleansing and still good on my sensitive skin! only buying this one from now on! :)</li>
    <li> Works well. It is very rich. I have to be paying attention to the amount to use- need only a small drop to wash face. Makes skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and am always getting compliments on my skin. I stopped for a a couple of weeks at one time to try another brand, and noticed my skin was not as clear and bright as it used to be, so I switched back. I think it might irritate those with sensitive skin because of the formula used to lighten aging spots and freckles. That formula tends to irritate regardless of what brand you use, but I&#x27;m used to it, so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. If you just want clean, clear skin and don&#x27;t have to worry about aging spots or freckles, try Shiseido&#x27;s Beneficiance line.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only product that makes my face squeaky clean. A little goes a long way too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for a few months now and have not seen any changes. It&#x27;s better than using $2 soap, I guess since it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. It does not remove makeup very well.</li>
    <li> Loving this product and using it everyday.  Thanks for the fast delivery.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend used my account to order it and she likes it.</li>
    <li> If you have naturally oily skin, like me, this does a great job of giving your face that very fresh/clean/no-more-oil feeling if you get what I&#x27;m saying. Very refreshing. Also great because you only need a pea-sized amount for the entire face, good quality stuff.</li>
    <li> Meets Expectations.  Excellent Product</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing foam. It&#x27;s very creamy so no need to use a lot. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product but I wish the price was a little bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> The wife Loves this product. I guess word of mouth is the best advertising. She either read about it or heard it from someone, like a friend. She tried it and has been buying it ever since. She also gets some of their other products. If it makes her happy, then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Skin feels so soft after each wash.</li>
    <li> I have used Shiseido White Lucent Brightening Cleansing Foam for several years, but usually buy this product at one of the big department stores. Shiseido White Lucent Brightening Cleansing Foam is a product that I read about, decided to give it a try, and loved it. I was thrilled to get it on amazon.com for such a great price.</li>
    <li> In my 45 years, I have never used such a fantastic facial wash. Less then a pea amount is enough to create the most luxurious foam to clean your entire face and neck and the both feel incredibly smooth with just a quick rinse. I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 2 weeks so I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes in my skin, but I will defiantly make updates to my review as needed. So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems allergy related and I can say already that I will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> I like the way my skins looks after using this product, &amp; so soft. I will order this prolduct again for sure.</li>
    <li> no left over residue. Refreshing clean feeling. It&#x27;s supposed to be used for woman, though I&#x27;m a guy in construction. It cleans my face thoroughly. Dirt and grease be gone while taking care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. My GF tried it. She loves it as well. It&#x27;s her staple.</li>
    <li> the face wash is very mild w/o any strong scents or greasy creaminess.  i didn&#x27;t see indication it did any brightening to my face after 6+ months of use.  i&#x27;ve switched to try other products in the line since but it&#x27;s definitely my safe facewash (i buy the travel size versions to avoid problems w/ airport security)</li>
    <li> Fresh smelling and a great pore opening cleanser. Brightens skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
    <li> This is a creamy cleanser that leaves your skin super clean without drying. Would get 5 stars if it was a little more affordable!</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser.  I have been using this for years and I have super sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. A tiny little pea sized drop and your face is covered in glorious lather. My skin is glowing. The surface texture is soft and smooth. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this cleanser. Perfect for uneven and aging skin. An incredible fix. I recommend the whole White Lucent line, as well. Check out the Anti Black Circle Cream, also a BIG winner.</li>
    <li> On time and well packaged! Love the product. Shiseido is the top of the line for skin care!!</li>
    <li> as described. brand-new in box. great packaging. fast shipping</li>
    <li> This product is great for my brown skin!!</li>
