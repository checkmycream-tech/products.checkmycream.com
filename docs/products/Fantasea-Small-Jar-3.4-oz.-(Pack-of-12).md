    <li> I really like these jars. I decided to make body butter for gifts and just to have fun. It is easy to make and I found all the supplies I needed on Amazon (thank you to all who write reviews)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MOST difficult ingredient to find was the containers! They are very expensive, generally more than $1 each even purchased in bulk. Glass is preferred but with body butter, it isn&#x27;t very hot when you pour it into a container so plastic works also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for 4 oz containers and these are 3.4 oz ... close enough. They are VERY attractive, sort of an opalite white, and have nice secure screw stops. They are a great alternative to the 4oz Ball style jars. And they shipped quickly ~ I received them in a few days. Not Amazon Prime, but with free shipping they are still a very good value!</li>
    <li> These are a much higher quality than I expected.  The lids screw on very smoothly &amp; the plastic is quite thick.</li>
    <li> Purchased these to put home made body scrubs in to give as gifts for the holidays. Lids fit tightly.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> These are so useful... for everything.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like to use them when I have to travel by plane.</li>
    <li> I just got started making my own body scrubs and these are perfect. I didn&#x27;t want anything with glass just in case it dropped in the shower. I love these jars.</li>
    <li> Served it&#x27;s purpose well.</li>
    <li> the jars are a great size, and being see thru is awesome. HOWEVER, they screw tops will leak. I used them for making homemade brown sugar scrubs, so not hugely watery, but they did leak if not kept completely upright. For something dry, this is perfect</li>
    <li> I made lotion as Christmas gifts and I wanted bpa free jars without spending a lot of money on glass jars. These were the perfect size, I only wish I had ordered more...</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Right size for gifts and good price.  First time I purchase this product and I&#x27;m very satisfied. Yes, I recommend.</li>
    <li> These jars are awesome!  I think they are the PERFECT hand-held jar.  Material is sturdy, smooth lines all around.  Plastic is slightly &#x27;rubberized&#x27; so it gives a great seal.... I have no problems with snagging when I seal the lids.... for $12.50 per dozen, I will buy again!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve found all kinds of things to do with these, carrying loose leaf tea for travel, storing nuts and bolts, various craft projects. just a really handy size, when i purchased i had no idea what i&#x27;d do with a dozen of these things but i&#x27;ve already put several in rotation. quality is good and the lid screws on nice, leak free and tight.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed! Snug, water-tight lids on these break-proof jars. Plastic is hydrophobic, so water rolls off insides of sides and lid. Great to be able to see content level inside.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel.  I was able to put my Wen in it for the whole week and it fit in my baggie so I could have it as carry on.  Price it good also.</li>
    <li> Great product perfect size used these for beauty products. Good secure lids</li>
    <li> VERY PLEASED WITH THESE CONTAINERS. THE QUALITY IS NICE AND I LOVE THAT THEY ARE INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED INSIDE A BIGGER BAG. The lid seals on nicely and the container isnt super bulky. It fits nicely into my purse with lotion inside. :)</li>

    <li> Liquid leaks on all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well for salves, ointments, solids, etc., but not a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps;)</li>
    <li> Great jaws.  I used them for EVERYTHING.  storing.  liquids.  candies.  you name it.</li>
    <li> Great for travel; however, I wish I could have purchased 4 - 5.  I have more than I need</li>
