      <li>Best colour I&#x27;ve ever bought, want more.</li>
      <li>Must do two good coasts to get covered.</li>
      <li>The color is gorgeous but it is a bit streaky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say on a fresh nail plate, two coats would make a perfectly opaque manicure!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love the color!</li>
      <li>Love the color!</li>
      <li>The Color is beautiful and it has a nice smooth finish to it.</li>

      <li>I love the CND gel polishes</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this polish.</li>
      <li>My favorite of the cnd collection.</li>
      <li>True to color the CND shellac goes on great &amp; looks good with only two coats.  </li>
      <li>It is the perfect Barbie pink.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s such a beautiful shade.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much!!))</li>
      <li>Very pretty, spring color!</li>
      <li>Perfect color for year round and just darling for spring!</li>
      <li>Goes on great as well and even lasted longer than other colors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Super Quality.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great color&lt;br /&gt;Application is smooth and lasts at least 2 weeks&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
      <li>im redoing a nail 3-5 days later, with more to follow, and quickly.</li>
      <li>I like this color, and it&#x27;s nice and opaque which I really like, but it&#x27;s gloopy and lasts the least amount of time of any of the colors I own.</li>
      <li>True to bottle color... takes longer than most gel coats to dry (2.5 mins vs 45 seconds)</li>
      <li>Its a beautiful pastel pink, I constantly get compliments on it.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so pretty.</li>

      <li>I love the gel colors because they last so much longer, this color is a must!</li>
      <li>I also have the tutti frutti color which I also love but sometimes feels too bright and flashy for my fingernails.</li>
      <li>I would certainly purchase this product again.</li>
      <li>It IS a bit more on the pink side</li>
      <li>Like the other CND nail products I love this for use with my UV light, it&#x27;s long lasting like the others and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I do my own gel manicures and often end up filing down my old colors and painting a new layer over them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought it as the main color for nails and Lilac Longing to be an accent color.</li>
      <li>I wish this color was around last year when I got married!  </li>
      <li>Such a fun spring color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how well this gel covers the nail!</li>
      <li>This CND, on the other hand, is super durable.</li>
      <li>Worth the extra dry time.</li>
      <li>This is Exactly the pink I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>formula is also surprisingly self-leveling and thin enough to do multiple layers without it being a clumpy disaster.</li>
      <li>More of a sugary pink than the pale purple I was hoping for.</li>

I was worried this would be too pale or too chalky, but I really like it. I also have the tutti frutti color which I also love but sometimes feels too bright and flashy for my fingernails. I can&#x27;t wait to try pairing cake pop WITH tutti frutti and see how that looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great, springy color go with this one!</li>
    <li> Such a fun spring color. My favorite of the cnd collection. Goes on great as well and even lasted longer than other colors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I wish this color was around last year when I got married!  This is the perfect pink/lavender color I was looking for.  I just got my pedicure last month with this and it&#x27;s such a beautiful shade.  It IS a bit more on the pink side but you can see the purple.  The girl that did my toes said all she could see was pink when she looked at it but when I got home my husband thought it was purple.  SO - I guess it&#x27;s a hard call.  Some people can pick up the lavender, others don&#x27;t seem to.  Perfect color for year round and just darling for spring!</li>
    <li> I love the CND gel polishes&lt;br /&gt;This is a great color&lt;br /&gt;Application is smooth and lasts at least 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was on schedule</li>
    <li> Thank you!!! I like it very much!!))</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this polish. It is the perfect Barbie pink. CND Shellac is the best polish that truly lasts.</li>
    <li> The color is gorgeous but it is a bit streaky. It takes about 3-4 coats to make it even. It&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
    <li> Love the color! Product arrived within the specified time frame.</li>
    <li> Its a beautiful pastel pink, I constantly get compliments on it. Not sheer like some colors turn out to be.</li>
    <li> More of a sugary pink than the pale purple I was hoping for. Bought it as the main color for nails and Lilac Longing to be an accent color. It wasn&#x27;t quite what I was hoping for which was a whiter shade of pale. But that&#x27;s just my personal preference. Nothing wrong with the polish or color in general.</li>

This CND, on the other hand, is super durable. I&#x27;ve had it on for a week and there is no fading/ change of color, lifting, or peeling. I used CND sticky base gel underneath and a red carpet Brilliance topcoat, and I&#x27;m super pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is also surprisingly self-leveling and thin enough to do multiple layers without it being a clumpy disaster.

    <li> For spring sweetness: I am slowly building my shellac collection, and now have about 6 colors. Not tons, but it&#x27;s getting there. I like this color, and it&#x27;s nice and opaque which I really like, but it&#x27;s gloopy and lasts the least amount of time of any of the colors I own. Every time I use it im redoing a nail 3-5 days later, with more to follow, and quickly. Darker colors definitely seem to last longer, but this is the worst of my light colors.</li>
    <li> This is Exactly the pink I was looking for.  I put a coat of sparkle over it and it&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
