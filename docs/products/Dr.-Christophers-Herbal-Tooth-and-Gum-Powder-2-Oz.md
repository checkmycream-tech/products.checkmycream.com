<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My gums looked awful (dark in color) and after using this product faithfully I can say my gums are back to a pink color and my teeth are amazing WHITE and doing this ALL NATURAL is what I&#x27;m all about!  This is the ONLY tooth &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; for me moving  forward.  It may take you sometime to get use to the fact that its not the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; tooth paste your use to. Kinda gritty and does not foam up in the mouth like &amp;#34;toxic toothpaste&amp;#34; but Oh so worth the results!</li>
    <li> Was having trouble with my teeth, gums.  Seamed to help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been fluoride-free with my dental care for over a year now. In that time, I&#x27;ve tried many things, like bentonite clay and baking soda, as well as activated charcoal. They both worked great but I wanted to give this a try, especially after the reviews that it added with tooth and gum issues(I don&#x27;t have any, but I&#x27;m a fan of preventative measures). Anyway, I ordered the 2oz (which came in a alf-filled 4 oz. jar) and used it the same night. This stuff stated foul! There was a hint of sweetness (from the stevia, I presume), but otherwise, it tasted to bad. That said, my teeth were squeaky clean afterwards, literally. I ran a ring across my front teeth and heard a squeak. This stuff is great! I&#x27;ll probably use it every other night (until I get used to the taste) and stick with activated charcoal for now. A great buy, IMO.</li>
    <li> Just as expected, as it was a recommendation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now (same 2oz) about 6 months ago I started mixing it with baking soda, cyan pepper, and cinnamon. I&#x27;m very happy with it :)</li>
    <li> Seems to clean well but not fond of the color of the powder. The color seems to dull tooth color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this. Bark removes plaque. Lets teeth remineralize. I spit in trash can and follow with baking soda and sometimes h202 mouthwash. This product leaves my teeth smooth and polished feeling. All natural and I think kills germs naturally. I have whiter teeth. This and bone broth and brush w activated charcoal sometimes. Yes!!! And no chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now and I definitely feel a difference. My teeth are much less sensitive. I have braces and have noticed some discolorating due to what i believe is my braces blocking my brush. I am using it on my two year old daughter as well and she has no staining. I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to the taste and actually really like it now, but at first it tasted really metalic. I added cinnamon to mine and that helped with flavor. Overall, I recommend this if you are looking to switch away from traditional toothpastes or need something to help strengthen your teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this powder, I will never go back to tooth paste. It leaves my mouth feeling tingly, it&#x27;s fantastic! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the taste of the stevia but it&#x27;s easily ignored.</li>
    <li> Good product though not convenient to use, bit messy</li>
    <li> Following directions for this product on the Dr. Christopher&#x27;s website, I used this as a gum pack, hoping it would tighten up my teeth and receding gums. For six nights a week, I applied to the gums around my bottom teeth, and the gums did seem to tighten up a bit. Encouraged, I decided to try the same regimen for my top teeth. Big mistake. The gums turned red and receded even more. When I stopped using the powder on my top teeth, the gums returned to their natural color. I am very disappointed in this product and cannot in good conscience recommend it, since it actually hurt my gums instead of healing them. If you are looking for something to heal swollen or bleeding gums, I recommend squeezing a CoQ10 gel caplet and applying that to gums instead.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find a tooth powder/paste that did not contain any artificial ingredients or Xylitol, etc...  I finally found this after hours of researching.  I can eat a lot of stuff that does not necessarily taste good, but this stuff is nasty.  If you like the taste/smell of cloves, you might like what this tastes like but the cloves is so overpowering, you cannot taste anything else.  Additionally, the consistency of it doesn&#x27;t really allow for it to stay in your mouth while you are brushing your teeth.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up (which I didn&#x27;t really expect since it doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial foaming agents) but it just isn&#x27;t a good consistency that allows for you to clean your teeth with it.  Lastly, you teeth are all dark green/brown while the substance is in your mouth, so I am concerned that if you brushed with it everyday, it might discolor your teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of or used tooth powder before...kind of a strange concept for me since I&#x27;ve never seen anyone in my family or friends use anything like this, but had been reading about the chemicals in commercial toothpaste, was considering making my own natural, homemade recipe from the ones available online and came across this. I&#x27;ll admit, I can see what the other reviewers were talking about with the dark green color and how it tends to stain your toothbrush, but that aside, I can honestly say that my teeth do feel cleaner and you do get a nice big jar of the stuff. You really taste the cloves - it&#x27;s like brushing your teeth with pumpkin pie spices - at least that&#x27;s what it takes like to me. I love pumpkin pie and cloves, so this is a plus for me :).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, another great product from this company. Thank you!</li>
    <li> After the dentist told me I needed another root canal, I remembered a Dr. Christopher lecture about white oak bark and wondered if it would help my bad tooth. I began using DC tooth powder along with flossing after every meal and before bed. The pain and swelling disappeared. The next time I went to the dentist, they couldn&#x27;t find the problem on the x-ray. Also, I had a couple places with swollen and receding gums; this has cleared up as well. At first it was strange, but I quickly got used to it. Now I can&#x27;t stand regular tooth paste. It didn&#x27;t stain my teeth at all. Maybe it was the 1 t. cinnamon I stirred into the jar to disguise the taste; cinnamon is used in India to whiten teeth. Initially, I found it left herb particles between my teeth, so I learned to rinse better after brushing. This is likely another reason for my good results. Finally, like other reviewers, the hygienist finds nothing to do in my mouth anymore nor does the dentist. I&#x27;ll likely stay out of the dentist office and keep him out of my pocketbook. Then I can send myself on a great vacation instead of paying for his.</li>
    <li> This suff mess up my teeth . Now l have to go to the dentist every 4 months .</li>
    <li> I used to cough until I fell asleep every night.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, figured out that I am allergic to something in toothpaste, probably fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using baking soda to brush my teeth for 35 years without any cavities or gum problems or coughing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Christophers Herbal Tooth &amp; Gum Powder sounded intriguing as an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;It is gritty, unpleasant, and I get the same allergic reaction as toothpaste:  constant coughing.</li>
    <li> I use this at the end of the day  Like to clean my mouth with these herbs,  before bed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited awhile to post this to give the product a fair shake. It is very different from the white minty paste I&#x27;ve used since childhood and it took some getting used to before fully appreciating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick and dirty review: different product, takes some getting used to, but the natural ingredients and the clean mouth feeling are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me and those who I&#x27;ve introduced to the product: I&#x27;m in my 40s with no tooth or gum issues, but I am a fastidious about having a clean mouth feeling. I came to this product after looking for a way to help my mother who is having some mouth issues. I have also given a bottle to my brother who is beginning to have gum problems. Everyone in my family who has tried this product has reported satisfaction with how it works and feels. Both my mother and brother are saying some of their mouth issues have improved. My sister-in-law, who also has no mouth problems, has been using this and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted in many other reviews, the taste is very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; and it does leave your brush and bowl brown, but a good rinse takes care of most of it. You can also add some cinnamon to the power to improve the taste if you&#x27;re super sensitive to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part of the product: The clean feeling in your mouth! It&#x27;s really amazing. It lacks that minty cool sense from store bought toothpastes, but what I noticed was my mouth didn&#x27;t feel dirty throughout the day. You know that grimmy &amp;#34;I need to brush my teeth&amp;#34; feeling? I didn&#x27;t get it with this product. Nor did I feel like I&#x27;d taken on a case of bad breath. Granted, nothing stops this feeling if you&#x27;ve eaten certain foods, but overall my mouth felt nicer longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product for about six months and my last dental visit showed no new problems and I spent less time in the chair for plaque scraping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use of the product can be messy because of the poor bottle design. I also purchased a bottle of the TheraNeem tooth powder with cinnamon and mixed the two products together. I then funneled the product into the TheraNeem bottle which allows you to sprinkle it on your toothbrush. Less mess and less waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big warning: Really rinse your mouth. Swish that water around and you won&#x27;t see the bits of herbs left behind. I read that many people have an issue with that, but with a good rinse, you should be able to get it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted I mixed two products together, but I have been using this for 6 months and I have only used about half the product. So value for the money is great. Especially when you see what crappy Colgate is charging for all those chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice to potential customers: Go into this knowing it&#x27;s a different product with a different taste. Realize it&#x27;s not the clean white paste you&#x27;ve used and it can cause a mess. This probably isn&#x27;t a cure all for bad mouth health, but it can help soothe and maybe improve. The natural ingredients mean absorbing less preservatives and chemicals into your body and that&#x27;s a good thing in any product. If you do buy, give yourself a fair trial and don&#x27;t get put off by the differences in taste or application.</li>
    <li> No more bad breath!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few years ago to help my receding gum line on my front lower teeth (caused by a bad tooth bleach), and it did cause my gumline to get almost back to normal. It stained my toothbrush, but so what.  My teeth were not stained, but that could be because I didn&#x27;t use it for a long period of time.    The other day my 12YO son was complaining of canker sores, which I am thinking were caused by the really acidic tomatoes we planted this year, and the toothpaste hurt him worse. Then I looked up and found that sodium lauryl sulfate will make canker and cold sores worse.  I thought of baking soda, and he used that once, and it didn&#x27;t sting.  Next day I remembered Christopher&#x27;s green tooth powder in the cabinet and told him to brush with that. He groaned about how yucky it was but kept brushing, and I scalded the green tint out of his toothbrush. Then he said, \\&quot;Mom, my canker sore doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.\\&quot;  And he was finally able to eat again (it had hurt too much to eat; he kept getting one canker sore after another for weeks). The next day his canker sore was nearly gone and was not painful.    I was only trying not to exacerbate the canker pain, but I had no idea this icky powder would practically cure it. My suggestion to people is to buy Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste or some paste without SLS (we don&#x27;t like fluoride either, and none of us have cavities). If SLS is bad for cankers, I can&#x27;t see it being good to put in one&#x27;s mouth at all.    If you find that the stuff stains your teeth, mix a teaspoon of baking soda with a half teaspoon of salt and brush with that (you can make a paste using water or peroxide, if you wish).  Stains will disappear.    I don&#x27;t know that I would use this everyday, but it sure is a good one to keep around in the medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> Think this is helping.</li>
    <li> stained my sink and teeth... i realy wanted to like it... but not useful at all.</li>
    <li> Refreshing to say the least.</li>
    <li> Definitely works but I thought it would be better- really just trying to find the next level stuff that&#x27;s gonna help me out</li>
    <li> Terrible, turned my teeth green.</li>
    <li> Worked on sore gums first application</li>
    <li> Nasty taste and the herb might stain your teeth.</li>
    <li> My sister got this for her teeth. The flavor is extremely bitter, but she can handle it. She seems to like it better than regular toothpaste. If you want an all natural toothpaste and can also withstand the extremely bitter taste, this is the toothpaste for you!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this product because I am trying to get away from glycerin.  But I did not like it because it is green and left some dark particles in between my teeth.  It would be better if it was white.</li>
    <li> Not sure what this does for my teeth/gums, but it tastes great, is very gentle on your gums and makes your mouth feel fresh.  I use a dedicated separate toothbrush for this powder because it tends to stain the brush and get far into the bristles (probably like other tooth pastes/powders but this one is very visible because of its color).</li>
    <li> I really like this, yes it stains toothbrush but works great. Used it on a absess and it pulled out the infection. Lasts forever, good stuff.</li>
    <li> First I gagged and about puked when using this, seeing the green spit in the sink about done me in.  I felt like I was eating grass, but the strange tingle in my mouth kept me interested.  Then, I read something about adding cinnamon, so I sprinkled a heavy dose in and tried again.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m chowing on hay anymore, AND, the texture and flavor are strangely addicting to me.  Am I crazy?  Maybe.  But I feel like my teeth are whiter, and my gums healthier.  I still have to squint a little at the green spit, but I&#x27;ll use this stuff forever...that tingle afterwards leaves me wanting more!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and will last forever. Doesn&#x27;t stain my teeth as some have said. They feel amazingly clean and is great for gum health.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a bunch of root canals and cavities and my sensitivity is to the point where I am unable to use normal tooth paste. Although this taste a bit funky it calms my teeth and gums down and I am able to brush without any pain. I would def recommend this to anyone we has any issues with their teeth. I also had a tooth ache and I ended up putting a bit of this on the root of the tooth and that helped a lot. It is a bit tricky to get it on your tooth brush since it is a powder, I would recommend first rinsing your toothbrush so it gets wet then just dip it in the container. Best way to get the most on.</li>
    <li> I really love this tooth and gum powder! My teeth feel very clean after using it and I even feel a difference in my gums. I can&#x27;t wait to go for a dental check up and see what the dentist thinks. The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the color, it makes you sink dirty. But I can deal with cleaning it more often.</li>
    <li> i have bad gums that have always been way too sensitive for traditional toothpaste which means i wasn&#x27;t brushing as often as i should, which in turn was making my gums worse. i read up on tooth powders and thought i would try it... i&#x27;m so glad i did! i love this stuff! within just a couple uses, my gums only bleed minimally and the swelling has gone down considerably. plus my breath feels fresher from the ingredients in this tooth powder than from toothpaste. it does stain my toothbrush, but my husband and i are the only one who see it so who cares? i will be buying more of this when it runs out :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do the job as I was hoping for. May work for some.</li>
    <li> the best tooth powder ever!</li>
    <li> I pretty much love anything by Dr Christopher but I think this is my favorite. I like the taste and love that it doesn&#x27;t have any of the nasty stuff that&#x27;s in toothpaste. It makes my teeth healthy and happy.</li>
    <li> Thiis is such good stuff! I come from a long line of folks with bad teeth and this has made a huge difference is sensitivity and receding gums and tooth and gum pain. Took a bit to get used to brushing with a powder that is brown at that but the taste is not bad at all it makes my teeth and gums feel fantastic!</li>
    <li> Bah!  I SO wanted to love this powder.  It immediately stained my teeth though, even after just one, overnight use (packing the powder at the gum line).  I tried it for two days in a row.  Then stopped and brushed my teeth normally, with baking soda, in order to lighten the stains (which was effective).  Then tried again about a week or so later, but leaving it along my gumline for only about 15 minutes.  It still stained my teeth.  Perhaps it could be used in conjunction with a baking soda and hydrogen peroxide brushing, in order to counter the staining, yet still benefit from the gum regeneration of the powder?  From all I&#x27;ve read of Dr. Christopher, he was a heck of a brilliant herbalist/healer though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just a couple of weeks into using this tooth powder...and I really like it. I dab a bit of toothpaste on my brush, dip it in the powder and go to town. It&#x27;s a bit on the licorice-side, flavor wise, but I&#x27;m used to it now. The combo of a wee bit of toothpaste, and this powder makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> at first I was a little skeptical about this but now after using this stuff I wont go back to fluoride it makes your teeth whiter and your mouth feels truly clean no coating I use it 2 aday</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again, its very messy and hard to use with an electric tooth brush. I guess if used a manual tooth brush, it wouldn&#x27;t be to bad. PJ</li>
    <li> This Herbal Tooth &amp; Gum Powder is AWESOME!!!  I have been using This tooth powder for about a year.  When I went to the dentist they asked me how long it had been since I had my teeth professionally cleaned and I told them over 2 years ago.  They said my teeth were very clean.  I still needed the gumline cleaned but they didn&#x27;t need to polish my teeth.  That never happened when I was using regular toothpaste.  I was told that one of my teeth looked like it might need a root canal.  But I went home and started packing the area around that tooth with the powder.  My tooth was hurting really badly.  Now it feels fine!  :D  At first the taste put me off but I got used to it.  My toothbrush looks a little stained but that doesn&#x27;t bother me either.</li>
    <li> I just used my herbal tooth &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; for the first time and I just felt compelled to write a review immediately after. After I had purchased this herbal &amp;#34;toothpaste,&amp;#34; I was hesitant to try it because it looked so odd. But once I tried it I was so happy I did! The herbs are refreshing in your mouth like a cooling sensation. Most importantly, my teeth feel clean and look great! I am so happy I bought this product as an alternative to fluoride toothpaste. I also don&#x27;t feel guilty because everything in this product is organic. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. Extremely satisfied!</li>
    <li> The whole family uses this now. We like that our teach feel cleaner.  I like that my gums no longer hurt. (regular toothpaste was starting to irritate my gums)  I LOVE that my daughter&#x27;s cavities are healing!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have sensitive teeth, which is probably from brushing too much because my teeth never feel clean. This product made my teeth feel like they were just cleaned by the dentist! The taste is a definite drawback but I can get past that because the product works so great!</li>
    <li> I am almost done with this product, so here is my review. I tried this product because I like experimenting non-commercialize products. I had high expectation for herbal remedy, and this one was not impressive to say the least. I could be imagining this, but it feels and seems like my teeth are turning slightly green because of the color of the powder. The taste may be too extreme for some, but I have adapted to it, so it&#x27;s not so bad for me: it&#x27;s a strong herbal taste. Unless you have a waterpik, you might end up having pieces of the powder stuck in your teeth and gum. Overall, my experience with this was slightly bad, but not terrible.</li>
    <li> I am very conscious of what I put in my mouth and how often I clean my teeth. I had gotten away from the toothpaste with detergents, sweeteners, and fluoride. This product is the answer to my dreams and it makes my teeth feel super clean and fresh when I brush with it. I can&#x27;t believe that I hadn&#x27;t found this sooner. It is full of herbs and good things, so the initial look at it was green and uh oh. But, it all rinses out and off. I&#x27;ve had a mouthwash (from dentist) discolor one of my patch-ups previously so believe me when I tell you this stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything but put a sparkle on your teeth!</li>
    <li> If you like foamy toothpaste you will have trouble getting used to this herbal powder. This green/brown powder is as fine as talcom powder. Minty smell and mild minty taste. Seems to clean teeth, but it is difficult to use. You have to use a tiny spoon (like 1/8 tsp) to sprinkle powder on your wet toothbrush. Even then, there is some waste. I wanted this to replace the chemical, plastic beaded crap the toothpaste companies sell, but will have to find something else. According to Dr C this powder can be mixed with water and made into a clay-like paste and applied to damaged gums (ie. gingivitis). I did not try this out, but believe it is possible.</li>
    <li> I saw Dr. Christopher&#x27;s tooth powder on another site I purchase from while purchasing some of his other products. We are always so impressed with them, so I decided to give this one a try. I have purchased EcoDent tooth powders now for the last 8 years or so, but like to try new things. I started using Tropical Traditions coconut oil toothpaste which I really like, but went back to the EcoDent, and found myself not as impressed as I once was. So, when I came across this, I was curious. Turns out I love this even better than the EcoDent brand! I will probably transfer this into the EcoDent bottle though because I prefer pouring it on rather than dipping my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this powder is truly impressive!  I did not have issues others have had with it leaving specks or green on my teeth. Not at all. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because they aren&#x27;t familiar with tooth powders, and use way more than they need to, aren&#x27;t rinsing their brush enough...or what is going on there. I expected it to be awful the way some complain about the taste, mess, and specks, but it is by far the best tooth powder I&#x27;ve ever used!  Not only is it not awful, it tastes good to me, and does not leave specks, or mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up in a Shaklee nutrition household, and to me, it tastes exactly like Shaklee brand alfalfa tablets. We used to make alfalfa tea with them sometimes, and this is what that tastes like. So, for me, this is a very familiar taste that I happen to like.  If you&#x27;ve never had alfalfa tablets, they are a bit &amp;#34;grassy&amp;#34; in flavor, add in a little mint leaf, and a bit of sweetness, and it tastes like mint herbal tea. I find it quite pleasant. Even more than the flavor is that it really works! After one use, my teeth felt just like I&#x27;d come back from a dental cleaning.  Slick, and slippery.....so much so, I couldn&#x27;t stop running my tongue over them! I&#x27;ve only been using for a week now, but this will now replace EcoDent&#x27;s brand. I love anise flavored toothpastes, and powders also, so may still get Nature&#x27;s Gate anise once in a while for a bit of a change, but as far as tooth powders go, this is the last one I need to try.&lt;br /&gt;My elderly father has teeth issues, and I am going to get him to try this. He tries most anything, and he likes alfalfa tea, so this is something he will not mind using. If you are used to using tooth powders, definitely give this a try.  If you are used to using tooth gels or pastes, tooth powders take a bit of time to get used to them. Initially when I started using powders, it was hard to get used to not having a foaming mouth full of tooth paste. No foam with powders, but no toxic ingredients either like most pastes have. It might&#x27;ve taken me a couple weeks or so to get really used to them.  It&#x27;s been at least 8 years now that I started using powders, so it&#x27;s hard to remember how long it took me, but I know it wasn&#x27;t an immediate love for them. However, had I started off with this brand, I might have liked them right away!&lt;br /&gt;The only real con I have is that it isn&#x27;t in a bottle instead, other than that, I think they could use a smaller jar.  Mine was just about half full, which I did not expect because Christopher&#x27;s products are usually full to the very top. I understand with the powder, they might be concerned it will spill all over the place if that full though, but did expect it to have a little more in the jar than it does. Tooth powders last a long time. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is something that may help those new to using tooth powders. Here is what I do:&lt;br /&gt;Just slightly dampen your brush.&lt;br /&gt;Shake off excess water.&lt;br /&gt;Lightly dip the bristles in. (I just dip the tip of my brush in, not the whole head)&lt;br /&gt;Brush as usual.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse brush well.&lt;br /&gt;Brush again with rinsed off brush leaving a brush full of water.&lt;br /&gt;Repeat brushing with rinsed brush as needed.&lt;br /&gt;I do this at least 3 times or so.  I probably rinse and do each row of teeth that way.I&#x27;ve never really paid attention to exactly how I do it.&lt;br /&gt;I have brushed this way since I was a little kid, even when using tooth pastes. A neighbor kid showed me when spending the night there, and we were all brushing our teeth together. His dentist showed him, and he showed us, cause we were all asking for a paper cup. For me, this leaves a much cleaner feeling mouth, rinses and brushes at the same time, and no need for a cup or putting your head under the faucet to rinse with water.  I kind of suck the water from the bristles as I rinse with it, not to drink it, but to use the water while brushing. Kind of hard to explain writing it out, I guess, lol.  In any case, maybe someone will get the idea, and it will help them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This product was purchased at FULL retail price for my own personal use.since I was a little kid, even when using tooth pastes.

    <li> It&#x27;s good, but I would not use it only, my teeth r responding well, but I am not expecting miracles, not cavies, but a couple of gums have pulled back from upper side, so I thought I would try.</li>
    <li> If you read other reviews on here you will get a better idea about what you are getting yourself into. It isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; at all. It serves it&#x27;s purpose but I find it slightly difficult to use. It will stain your toothbrush. (who cares?) it doesn&#x27;t taste bad. It is just kinda hard to actually get on your teeth. it&#x27;s all natural which is nice and it does have clove which has a numbing effect.</li>
    <li> Taste and color are different since I have not used a powdered tooth cleaning element before.&lt;br /&gt;tolerant wise it is good.&lt;br /&gt;Will see how it continues to work when I go to my next dental checkup.</li>
    <li> Good product, like the way it makes my teeth feel.</li>
    <li> It is kind of harsh at first to switch from toothepaste to this powder, which is strong. But, I will say it cleans my teeth and freshens my breath so I like it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, who was trying to add a little bit of life to his root canal gone bad. His gums were black when we found this product. And he was told there was no alternative but to eliminate his tooth completely. This herbal tooth powder has already extended the life of his tooth for over 4 months... and completely eliminated any pain that was present on his gums. It will hurt your gums a little, if you overdue use of this... and it&#x27;s easy to over due treatment when you see such good results. But moderation.... excellent product though.</li>
    <li> This one is hard to rate. It is exactly what they said it would be, and I needed that to be the case, but still, it&#x27;s like brushing your teeth with tree bark (just like they said it would be). I participate in American history re-enactments circa 1750 and Crest had yet to be invented but one cannot go very long without some sort of scrubbing. Baking soda will work but is very salty and gritty.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Christophers Herbal Tooth &amp; Gum Powder isn&#x27;t the modern tooth paste most of us prefer but it&#x27;s better than baking soda.</li>
    <li> It tastes different, not bad just different,  but really cleans your teeth the best I have used!</li>
    <li> Dr. Christopher makes a great product. Very happy with my purchase/</li>
    <li> So far, this seems to be working pretty well. My teeth feel nice, and they seem to be whiter. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I don&#x27;t have bad teeth just ugly pockets where I get slight infection of the gums.  The first time I had to get a deep cleaning it was NOT FUN. I set out to find something that would help my gums and I found Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Formulas Herbal Tooth &amp; Gum Powder.  The taste is not all that great but I grew up having to sometimes use the leaves from a pea tree and mint to clean my teeth so the taste was nothing to complain about. After a few months my teeth and gums felt and looked really good. Even after the first use you can see result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I stopped using it for a few years and had to get another deep cleaning. I did not want to go through that again so I went out and bought another jar.  It reduced some of the gum swelling and infection but I still had to get the cleaning - hurt like hell. I don&#x27;t expect it to be a miracle product but it works like one if used correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice something this time around after using the powder.  I didn&#x27;t have a stash of the powder at work and I wanted to brush after lunch and used toothpaste instead. My gums were swollen and sensitive by the time I was done brushing. I tossed the paste and bough another jar of the powder to keep at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I sometimes use a bit of olive oil (not a lot) to make it into a paste to stick to my gums and sit for a few minutes.  Awesome product&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh...It didn&#x27;t stain my teeth... lol</li>
    <li> I have tried countless numbers of toothpastes and tooth powders.  I keep coming back to this one.  It is my favorite.  Does NOT make my teeth more sensitive, unlike Squigle &amp;#34;enamel building&amp;#34; paste which actually made my issues worse.  Christopher&#x27;s powder seems like the most gentle and my teeth seem the most healthy when I use it.  My gums like it, too! :)  I use it instead of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> working for my gums! i use it every time i have gums issues, it works like magic</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Makes your mouth dark colored as well as your sink. Tastes like clove, so if you don&#x27;t like clove this isn&#x27;t for you. Works well enough but maybe baking soda works just as well?</li>
    <li> kinda licorice flavored, but I like it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff. The powder works great.  Amazing reviews from the dentist.</li>
    <li> I read a book about Dr. Christopher and was compelled to look through his products after learning about his natural remedies.  I&#x27;m not a whole foods, all natural foods kind of person, but am willing to try new things if they are supposed to work. The reviews on Amazon were positive about it, so I ordered it. My hope was that my husband, who has periodontal disease but hates the dentist, would use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has been using it for one month this week. Before he began using this power, his gums were disgusting - kind of blackish around his teeth and receding. His gums in front are now pink and healthy looking and improving greatly everywhere else. They have tightened up around his teeth and seem to be advancing somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is truly amazing. His only complaint is that his morning coffee tastes bad after using the power because of the heavy clove taste. Now, he is drinking a cup of tea first before he starts on the coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product - it works.</li>
    <li> I like it, good taste different to use because its a powder! I mix a small batch with coconut oil  it becomes more of a paste then! Coconut oil is good for you also! My gums look pink again and i do reccomemend it! Susan C in Fl</li>
    <li> Great product and works as described! Definitely does what it says it will do. Highly recommended. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The tooth powder is pleasant without being overpowering.  It seems to do the job and clean well without being abrasive.  My only dislike is that the powder is grey.</li>
    <li> Tastes good. My teeth feel clean after.  After a few weeks of regular daily use my tooth be gum sensitivity had greatly decreased and they are a little brighter.  Dr Christopher is a genius</li>
    <li> I love the taste and the way my mouth feels afterwards.  I thought it was working great.  Um, my teeth were getting more and more sensitive the longer I used it.  I went back to a toothpaste that had fluoride and now it&#x27;s getting better.  :(  Really wanted it to work.</li>
    <li> A great product no problem I like will for sure be buying more of it works but there is one other I found that I like more an has stop my tooth decay really but will buy jus to use as back up overall its a great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the two pack because they cost lest than if you would buy two for $13.49.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This arrived to my home July 22nd and I&#x27;ve been using it daily ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now it gets 3 stars because of the slow results and the bleeding gum problem that I still have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I was a kid I&#x27;ve always had a problem with one of my lower teeth.  It becomes severely loose if I clinch my mouth shut.  I&#x27;m 40 now and this tooth is still doing the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Back in 2001 when I had dental insurance a dentist told me I had periodontitis.  So I got a root scaling done.  Apparently that was only a temporary fix because I still have that tooth where my gums still bleed.  I hate waking up in the morning with a metallic taste.  I know it&#x27;s gross but I will do a spit test and my saliva would be pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a minute and I no longer have dental insurance so I&#x27;ve been looking for herbal remedies and I came across this b/c of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this does not have teeth cleaning properties so I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s suggested that this powder can be replaced with toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I have a rechargeable toothbrush and this turned my toothbrush brown within 3 days.  Who knows if damage has been done because loose powder have fallen into the crevices of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to sleep with a gum pack on only to find the next morning there wasn&#x27;t a trace of powder in my mouth.  I swallowed this stuff sometime in the night.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of these ingredients do the same thing such as: stopping bleeding, repairing broken bones, arthritic remedies, ulcer remedies. The prickly bark ash is the only thing that is used for teeth such as a tooth ache.  Bayberry bark is not for internal use. Slippery Elm is for gastrointestinal issues, sore throats, and other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brushed with this for three minutes and I saw no improvement.  I then brushed my teeth and didn&#x27;t rinse for 15 minutes and saw no change.  I then left this on for 20 minutes and again saw no change.  I then started rubbing this on my gums and tried to keep my mouth closed without trying to let saliva build for 2-3 hours and noticed some tightness in the gums where I&#x27;m having problems with my tooth.  I&#x27;m guessing the longer this is left on the better the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small gum area where my tooth is loose is still soft.  I still have an occasional blood filled saliva in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a quick fix.  It&#x27;s a slow process.  I still do oil pulling in the morning with coconut oil and comfrey root powder which has tremendously helped my on coming cavity.  With this it&#x27;s too soon to tell if this is worth the buy or not.</li>
    <li> For some reason I thought this had comfrey root in it... but it doesn&#x27;t. Otherwise, pretty good.... that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I use this product almost everyday and this works even better then toothpaste. Every time I use it my teeth and gums feel like they&#x27;ve come right out of the dentist office. The herbs in this product are really strong and feels like your brushing your teeth with dirt, but (in my opinion) tastes delicious. When I went into the dentist after using this product my dentist was impressed that my teeth looked so clean and well. My demist asked me what toothpaste I was using so I just said that I used the fluoride toothpaste that they&#x27;ve been telling me to use (I don&#x27;t think its good to tell my dentist this). My teeth feel great after using this product and is good for anybody who has any tooth or gum problems because this will fix you right up.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Ignored negative reviews and took a chance!&lt;br /&gt;Very positive chance, i believe i feel it working already.&lt;br /&gt;Used twice already, i feel a tingly sensation when brushed on my teeth or rubbed on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping for the best, give it a shot, what is there to lose?</li>
    <li> My teeth are in better shape after using this. Could hardly believe it but a few were loose and they are not now!</li>
    <li> I have only use this product if you times with an electronic brush and I dip it in coconut oil first, and then I did the coconut oil brush head into the powder. I run it under the sinks water gently and brush my teeth with the mixture. I, unlike a lot of reviewer&#x27;s on here, and maybe it is because of the coconut oil, have found that this product in combination with the coconut oil has a very pleasant taste and leave my breath smelling wonderfully! I like the feeling/way it leaves my mouth feeling and my gums and teeth. They feel smooth and I don&#x27;t want to say anything to strong yet but they feel strengthened. I haven&#x27;t yet to experience Lightning effects that some reviewers have . I don&#x27;t find that it stains my sink or my toothbrush though. I will update when I have used it more often and/or more frequently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on the review. I&#x27;ve been using this for quite sometime now WITH coconut oil and I ADDED some BENONITE clay too , being said this make sure I have used quite a few times now I usually try to use it at least once every few days if not every other day or every third day. It Has not stained my sink, why do you think gums feel fresh and stronger and I had a family member comment to me that my teeth look whiter, it is been a very very gradual and very very gentle process but I do think they look whiter too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update *** I stopped using this for a few Months , and when I recently went back to it , I could really tell , see and feel the difference that it makes when I use it ! Upon using it again , my mouth felt WAY fresher , and my teeth look slightly whiter, and my mouth just feels better. I don&#x27;t want to go that long not using this fabulous product , I really feel the difference when I do .</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using tooth powder instead of &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste. This is very minty and my teeth, gums, and tongue feel great!</li>
    <li> no more plastic,no more plastic,no more plastic,no more plastic,no more plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tooth powder is much better than the convential chemical filled tubes of toothpaste that come from the general brands, but I hate that it is in plastic. I did find a chemical free organic tooth powder in a glass jar that I like much better.</li>
    <li> Everyone has different oral flora.  The herbs in this powder have helped me maintain healthy gums to support my teeth.  Tastes good.  Strong clove scent and taste, which I love.  I use it over night.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff, bought it on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes good, works very well, and now regular toothpaste seems a bit slimy.  The only thing we cant get over too well is the GREEN/BROWN toothbrush we are left with.  When we travel, we use regular toothpaste.... dragging around a brown toothbrush is just too gross looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The tooth product works like tooth paste and taste sweet, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for strengthening teeth. Wished it worked out better.</li>
    <li> Eh? Can&#x27;t tell if this stuff is helping or damaging my teeth and gums. Some days I feel squeaky clean and my teeth look bright, some days they teeth look slightly brown and my gums hurt. Dunno! Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It took me awhile to get used to the taste, I started using it by dipping my brush into the powder, but that didn&#x27;t work too well.  Then I made a paste with a little water and put that on my brush, didn&#x27;t work too well either.  Then a friend of mine told me he put a small amount of toothpaste on his brush, ran water over it them dipped into the powder.  This works great!  Softens the taste of the powder and still gives the refreshing taste of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started trying it because I have some gum problems and also a major problem with plaque.  So far is has taken the coffee stains off the back of my bottom teeth and I can&#x27;t wait to go to the dentist to see how my plaque is doing!</li>
    <li> After using, teeth feel so clean.  Strong tasting.  Breath stays fresh all day.  After one week my gums do not look as irritated.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! A little messy, but love the results. I was starting to have some gum recession and a couple teeth felt like an electric shock when touched near the gums. Dentist said nothing I could do about it and read online how not fun it is and how it only gets worse, so ordered this. I have been using it for 2 months and cannot tell if gums have moved back, but NO pain when I touch near the gum line. I can rub my teeth all I want and no more worrying when I go to get a cleaning that it might hurt.  The best!</li>
    <li> Excellent, cleans thoroughly and leaves smooth tooth surface.  As a senior this is better than any other product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time and great for the money.</li>
    <li> Great taste. Feel my mouth is cleaner when I use this product. I load my toothbrush with toothpaste and then dip it into the powder and brush. It&#x27;s a fine powder that&#x27;s not pretty when you spit it out after brushing but cleans your teeth so welll.</li>
    <li> My husband noticed my teeth look whiter. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF, IT HELPS MY HUSBANDS GUMS THAT GET DRIED OUT WITH USING HIS CPAP MACHINE. ANYONE WHO USED A CPAP SHOULD INVEST IN THIS STUFF</li>
    <li> Two days, already in love with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tastes like minty herbal teas.&lt;br /&gt;A little powder goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Dip moistened brush.&lt;br /&gt;Superb cleaning formula gets into hard to reach spots while still being gentle.&lt;br /&gt;No burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;Gums feel stronger. Helps with sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to see if it&#x27;ll aid in recalcifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint:The sticker seal on my container obstructs important information such as directions, storage instructions and end date.</li>
    <li> Many reviews complain about its taste.  I think they are a bit hasty.  I am sure the main adjustment is to the cloves.  I have found two things helpful.  1) Be patient (unless you are really really sensitive to taste) and the flavor issue actually changes to enjoyment.  2) Also get yourself a little scoop to dispense the powder to avoid wasting it.  I find that the best way to use it is to wet your toothbrush and then apply a small amount of it to your toothbrush with a tiny scoop of it.  This avoids waste and the contamination of the powder by putting your toothbrush in too close proximity to the product.</li>
    <li> Not for me. I really wanted to use this. I&#x27;ve been loosing enamle off my teeth for years. I was looking to stop it and hopefully reverse it. I used this tooth powder for few weeks. It is messy and tastes different but actually I liked the taste. However i noticed my teeth beginning to stain.. I switched back to my regular tooth paste and saw an immediate difference. I tried doing every other day but the staining was very noticeable. I finally gave it up. Overall I would have used it regular had it not stained. Everyone&#x27;s different. I just have soft enamale I think.</li>
    <li> So far so good. . . .a little too early to tell regarding the effectiveness.  I appreciated all of the comments provided me prior to purchasing.</li>
    <li> i HAD ADVERSE REACTION.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell if it works! But no fluoride and keeps the homeostasis of mouth ok!</li>
    <li> The taste is terrible.</li>
    <li> We really wanted to like this stuff, but it just tastes terrible. The texture is a lot to ignore, too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is with this one, it makes my teeth feel weak and it causes staining, though it makes my gums feel amazing. For some reason I react opposite to what Dr. Christopher products seem to intend, and I really want to like them.</li>
    <li> I have used Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Tooth &amp; Gum Powder every day for over a year as my tooth paste. I waited until after my last dentist appointment to write this review. When I was at the dentist office I asked my dentist how my teeth looked and she said,\\&quot; Great, it is obvious that your brushing has been working because you have very little plaque\\&quot;. That is not common. I always have lots of plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to be fair I have made some other changes to my oral health care routine. I use oil pulling everyday, for twenty minutes, with extra virgin coconut oil. Oil pulling is just a matter of swishing different oils around in your mouth ,like mouth wash, for 15-20 minutes. And I take high doses of vitamin D3 daily. Why I mention vitamin D3 is because after taking high doses for a few months, I went to the dentist, and I felt like I had super teeth. Where before my teeth were pretty sensitive and weak, they now felt impervious to the dentist&#x27;s poking and prodding at them. They really felt strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this in mind I think this tooth powder is having a positive effect. After brushing my teeth, they feel really clean and fresh. They feel slick. They have gotten whiter. They really shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste of the powder is good. It is earthy and clovey. It is a little bit bitter, but not in an overpowering way. I like it much better than the taste of synthetic fluoride toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This jar can last you for a long time. I have had mine for over a year and it is only half way gone! Which means I might be using it for a whole other year! A pretty good value for thirteen bucks, no? Because of my dentist&#x27;s positive feedback I will continue to use this powder and would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;PS: I was cavity free!vels of plaque again which I attribute to the coconut oil and the tooth powder. I&#x27;m still using Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Tooth &amp; Gum Powder as my tooth paste and using oil pulling regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also mention that I don&#x27;t get fluoride treatment at the dentist&#x27;s office and haven&#x27;t for years. I also drink mostly distilled water which has fluoride removed from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I don&#x27;t need fluoride to be cavity free. Fancy that!</li>
    <li> Tastes really great, which surprised me. Yes it makes a mess, but my teeth feel cleaner, so it&#x27;s work it!</li>
    <li> My teeth were yellowing near the gum line and I have been using this for over a week and it has made a huge difference! I should have taken before and after pictures. And my teeth feel so clean afterwards even though it is highly minty or anything. It is a really nice clean feeling. I highly highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I actually like the flavor.  My mouth feels really clean, and my teeth are whiter.  I have had really good luck with all of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products and this one is no different</li>
    <li> I got this for sensitive teeth. I have no problems since I started using this and my children like it over toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t have the burning mint sensation for them. It tastes pleasant, but it is dark. Watch out for it spilling though. My children have dumped more than we&#x27;ve been able to use. The powder goes a long way. For a family of 5 it would last about 3 years.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell of  the regular tooth paste.  I like the smell of herb.  It only  takes 2 weeks to see gum grew back after cleaning.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully it cleans your teeth better than the Dentist. It stopped my gum pain and irritation on the first use. I had to get use to texture and taste because it so different from regular toothpaste and powder I&#x27;ve ever use but I like it very much and love the results so far.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for myself and sent another order to my 95 year young Aunt; we both highly recommend this power and will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> I like this product because of how natural it is, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t fully clean my teeth. I don&#x27;t know if its because of the toothbrush I use or what.</li>
    <li> My wife thinks the product is very good.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product, I haven&#x27;t seen any immediate results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give this a chance.  I have very bad teeth, under close dentist supervision and I just was scared I&#x27;d make matters worse.  Used two days and discarded.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It is dark in color so it will stain your tooth brush. I&#x27;m using for receeding gums etc so&lt;br /&gt;I will have to give it time to work, help and then report back. I&#x27;m also using an herbal liquid for my&lt;br /&gt;gums etc too in combination to see how they help.</li>
    <li> Best tooth powder out there</li>
    <li> While my teeth feel really clean after using it, it stained my teeth even with added cinnamon. I&#x27;m not in the process of whitening them to get them back to their original color.</li>
    <li> one reviewer ave this 1 star he&#x27;s wrong this is very nice&lt;br /&gt;this doesnt stain, i find this a good formula&lt;br /&gt;love the fact its good for your teeth&lt;br /&gt;its not awful, im very glad&lt;br /&gt;the powder could be compacted however it goes nicely onto the brush right from the jar&lt;br /&gt;it 3/4 full so i expected some more volume, kind of pricey to buy more than one</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tooth &amp; gum powder, my toddler and I have been using it. When we traveled and had to use store brought toothpaste I noticed a major difference. This tooth powder keeps my mouth feeling cleaner, my teeth look better and it really does eliminate morning breath. For younger children I would make sure when they brush mid-day they don&#x27;t have on any light colors because it is green :) Great buy I have recommended this item to many family members and friends. Once you use this you will not want to use store brought toothpaste of any kind again. I have also noticed a reduced sensitivity to cold that I had been experiencing.</li>
    <li> I sure didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I bought this product.  It was on a whim.  I was surprised as it was greenish brown.  The consistency is nothing like toothpaste so you have to be aware of that.  It&#x27;s gritty but tastes good like cloves.  I discovered if I get the product wet, not just my toothbrush, that it is a better consistency than just the dry product.  My teeth feel clean afterwards.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve noticed anything else yet but then again, I alternate using it w/ my toothpaste so to be fair I haven&#x27;t given it a good enough chance yet.</li>
    <li> i had wisdom tooth tearing my gums and I needed something gentle and effective to calm my gums down and disinfect. my non-fluoride natural toothpastes weren&#x27;t doing the job. love this stuff. I wet my brush, stick it in a jar and then  add quantum gum cream on top. both products are great. this powder won&#x27;t whiten your teeth, so you might want to use activated charcoal powder for that&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE august 2014. I still use this stuff. i&#x27;m on my 3rd jar. second jar got moldy half way in. I had to throw it away and get a new one. now I keep it in a fridge. can&#x27;t find in stores quantum gum cream I was using in addition to this gum powder so had to make my own mixing myrrh powder, clove oil, peppermint oil, calcium bentonite powder, trace minerals, ceylon cinnamon and a few other things.</li>
    <li> Well, my teeth looked green while using and it doesn&#x27;t taste so great. I&#x27;m wanting to go all natural, but this product misses the mark for me in it&#x27;s &amp;#34;user-friendly&amp;#34; status. I won&#x27;t be buying it again. It is totally safe and natural though. I&#x27;ll stick to the safer toothpastes from the market.</li>
    <li> Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Tooth &amp; Gum Powder stained my teeth and toothbrush yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is ok and the powder did seem to make my gums feel well. After the second day of use, however, my teeth became almost neon yellow-ish green.  In fact, the staining was so bad that I had to bleach my teeth.  Thank goodness the bleaching is working or I would be embarrassed to smile in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase this product if you want to pay almost $15 for the privilege of having &amp;#34;summer teeth&amp;#34; (some are yellow and some are missing).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great but my toddler couldn&#x27;t get over the taste and would not sit through a brushing with it.</li>
    <li> Great powder. I&#x27;ve used it for a few months and it seems to work (I hope it does!). No problems so far. While it took me time getting used to it, the taste has become much more palatable over time.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  It doesn&#x27;t taste half bad either.  I enjoy using it, my teeth look great and feel great and I am already seeing the benefits.  My dentist has been amazed at the healing of my cavities and the huge turn around from my swollen gums a few months ago.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I randomly found this product at Amazon. I have poor gum and often need painful deep cleaning at dental office despite that I religiously brush and floss my teeth.  I don&#x27;t have much expectation on this.  However after using it for a few weeks, I notice that my gum looks &amp;#34;visually&amp;#34; better.  Don&#x27;t really want to get into details how ugly my gums looked like before...Now, instead of rinsing all the herbs out after brushing, I keep them in my mouth for full benefit.  Yes, it tastes like herb  but I know it&#x27;s doing good for my teeth. And it&#x27;s nothing compares to painful and expensive deep cleaning procedure.</li>
    <li> Great Tooth &amp; Gum Powder, I am still using It.  Thinking of order it in the Future when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that the first time I used it, it was different! Using a powder is different from using a paste, however, the feeling I had after using this was amazing! The freshness lasts all day and my mouth feels so clean!! I will never go back to regular tooth paste.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I increase the amount of fluoride I used in my toothpaste and mouthwash, but after a couple of years of trying that with no reduction in cavities I decided to start drinking distilled water and to use Dr. Christopher&#x27;s herbal tooth powder.  After the first 6 months of using the tooth powder the dental assistant commented that my pockets were shrinking.  Great news!</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I&#x27;m brushing with oregano. Not like the other powders out there. But just got to give it a couple more weeks. But hey we shall see</li>
    <li> My teeth started turning brown after using this so I cannot really recommend: ( Will try something else that will hopefully remove the staining.</li>
    <li> My 3yo prefers this by far over tooth soap.  There is really no flavor, just tastes like bland herbs, like a mild tea or something.  It is messy, which I don&#x27;t like very much, but oh well.  We&#x27;ll keep buying it :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a health food fanatic, and also use healthy products. It&#x27;s a lifelong learning experience. Imagine my horror when I learned titanium dioxide, a cancer causing agent, was in my healthfood store toothpaste! It&#x27;s even in some chewing gum there. I couldn&#x27;t find a toothpaste without it.  I can&#x27;t stand department store toothpastes...I don&#x27;t care what my dentist says.  They have horrid ingredients in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started digging around online and found an article. One suggestion was this tooth powder. I got it todyy and love it already.  It&#x27;s got a slightly minty sweet herbal earthy taste with some natural grit to it. It&#x27;s a brownish green product and make  your teeth look brownish when brushing, but clear after you rinse. My teeth felt smmoth and polished, without some toothpaste grit feeling left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with  Dr. Tung&#x27;s tongue cleaner (don&#x27;t use their tongue gel...it has saccharine and other bad stuff in that...gelpack sample went straight to the trash). After brushing my teeth and then using it on my tongue with the cleaner my breath and mouth feels freash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see the results of continued use. Have been having some bleeding gums, even though I take really good care of my teeth. Also faster plaque buildup. Not sure why. I hope this product helps resolve  these issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And who else hates drinking water after yucky toothpaste? Even if you&#x27;ve washed your mouth well, you can still taste remants of it...then you drink that down when you drink water. Drinking minute particle  of flouride, titanium dioxide and saccharine several time  daily cannot be good for the health. By the way, I brushed after every meal for years with flouridated toothpaste and still got cavities. So I honestly am not convinced flouride reduces or eliminates cavities.  Eating a proper diet and keeping your teeth clean helps, and why do you need a tons of chemicals to have a healthy mouth?  Honestly, *as I step off the soap box* the herbs and things from the earth in their natural state are  here for our healing. This product is for our good health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post back here in the future if I have additional things to syy about the product, good or bad.bs and things from the earth in their natural state are  here for our healing. This product is for our good health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post back here in the future if I have additional things to syy about the product, good or bad.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my teeth feel clean and breath smell good. It looks weird and dark at first when you first brush them, but it all washes off. The key ingredient here are cloves.</li>
    <li> Good for the teeth and gums; I like the ingredients.</li>
    <li> my teeth and gums thank me  no more tarter  fresh breath long lasting  great product will buy it again&lt;br /&gt;taste gets while getting use too but after that you love taste of bark:)</li>
    <li> Trying to avoid a root canal and can see this is helping tremendously. I am a huge fan of all Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have...alternative methods with integrity.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. She is trying to go natural with everything, because she has lupus, so she says that this is awesome...&lt;br /&gt;She likes the taste, and she says it makes her gums tingle and feel cleaner than toothpaste...</li>
    <li> This product is great so far.  I hope it lives up to it&#x27;s claims.  I brush my teeth with it daily.</li>
    <li> Many people are discovering the benefits of herbal tooth care and the dangers of fluoride. I consider this product a rare-find. Using this as toothpaste, tooth pain has practically disappeared and attributes of healthy gums has returned without a more invasive and expensive dentist visit. Excellent product and recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to tea, however, the herbal mix has a slight staining quality. While not a real issue for someone seeking healthy alternatives to oral care; my wife, who prides herself on perfect teeth, prefers non-staining fluoride-free tooth care solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if your teeth hurt, I would recommend Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Formula before the dentist&#x27;s drill. If you are a superstar smiling for millions of people, there are alternatives.</li>
    <li> What a great alternative to commercial, fluoride filled toothpastes! It leaves my teeth and gums really fresh with no cloying aftertaste.</li>
    <li> I would be very weary of this product. It contains white oak bark, which is supposed to tighten gums but it did nothing but damage my gums and teeth. I used it for about a month, and during that time I noticed increased gum inflammation, increased gum redness, and staining of the teeth. White oak bark contains calcium which is known to play a part in strengthening tooth enamel and making teeth appear whiter, however my teeth began to turn a faint brown color. They returned to their normal color after disuse. My gums have also improved slightly with disuse, but are still not as healthy as they used to be. The specific area that I applied the powder on my gums turned a faded red and became extremely dry unlike the other areas of gum. I did a little research on white oak bark and discovered that due to the high amount of tannins present, it was often used by Native Americans to tan leather! My gums were beginning to look like tanned leather skin, very dry and they had also shrank somewhat. I do not recommend this product to anyone and if you do decide to use it I would be extremely careful and vigorously monitor your gum and tooth health. There are other natural oral products you can use. I recommend products with tea tree oil (a disinfectant) or hyaluronic acid (regenerates tissue). I&#x27;m sure white oak bark has its place in alternative medicine, I just do not recommend it as a tooth powder or mouth rinse.</li>
    <li> My entire family has been using this powder for a month now  and our teeth has never been better. My husband had really stained teeth and now his teeth are whiter and smoother. I HAD signs of gum disease and now i dont! My gums no longer bleed and the tarter loosened and  just fell of my teeth without much effort other than regular brushing twice a day and  Its even healing a small cavity i had! Its almost gone! My daughter went to the dentist last week and they couldnt scrap anything off her teeth. I figure if i keep brushing in 90 days my cavity should be totally gone! *Claps* Now dont get me wrong i wont stop going to the dentist because of this powder but i know i will have better visits!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to help my receding gum line, but it&#x27;s a pretty good product despite that.  I think my morning breath was a little better with it.  Also, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients included in TOMs of Maine toothpastes, such as SLS and Carrageenen.  I just wish this product came in paste form as powder is a pain.</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes awful. AND I can&#x27;t get used to spitting out dark brown crap after I brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> Great product I&#x27;ve ordered twice will order again once I&#x27;m out. My whole family uses the stuff even my seven year old</li>
    <li> My special needs nephew was suffering from gum disease, receding, bleeding gums, horrid breath and canker sores. We had tried just about everything to help him control the problem. Out of desperation I ordered Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Tooth &amp; Gum Powder. In the first week I noticed his breath was better! We have been brushing his teeth with it for almost 4 months now. His gums are healing and beginning to return to a normal color, canker sores are gone and bleeding from the brushing has drastically decreased. Tonight for the first time!!! he said it didn&#x27;t hurt to brush his teeth!! We still have plenty in the jar, but I just ordered two more because I never want to run out!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product! I have receding gum lines &amp; I usually wake up with my gums hurting but the first time I used it, I brushed with it and put some between my gums and lip/cheek before I went to bed and I woke up with no pain! It was amazing! I have only been using it for 3 days but I am eager to see the outcome after using it for a while. As for the packaging, it was ok but it didn&#x27;t come with any directions on how to use it except what was on the bottle and for a first time user it didn&#x27;t help. I had to go onto Dr. Christopher&#x27;s website to find the directions. Anyone who is wanting to know how to use it, this is what I found and did. Wet your tooth brush and lightly dab the top of the bristles on the powder (just enough to cover the top of the bristles). After brushing, rinse well. If you want to put some on your gums overnight, wet your finger and dab the powder then paste it on your gums and on your teeth (you&#x27;ll have to do it several times in order to get it everywhere). Don&#x27;t spit any out, it&#x27;s all herbs so it won&#x27;t hurt if you swallow some. In the morning, rinse well. If you have sore gums like I do, it may tingle a little but it dies down after a little while. Brush 2 - 3 times a day with it but only paste in on your gums overnight. The taste is not that bad but does take some getting use to being that it&#x27;s a powder and all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I&#x27;ve recently stopped using most commercial products, however, i haven&#x27;t found a natural alternative to toothpaste that i like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste takes getting used to, but after the first use i could already feel the difference. My teeth felt smoother, cleaner, and i had a tingly feeling in my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week, i decided to add Black Walnut Hull powder, and cinnamon to it. Apparently, Black Walnut Hull powder is good for rebuilding enamel, and Cinnamon helps cut the taste and add whitening power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that i really dislike about this is that the powder gets stuck to my toothbrush and it&#x27;s difficult to clean off. However, I&#x27;ve started turning it into a paste with coconut oil and that has helped keep my brush clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also added some peppermint essential oil because i miss the minty feeling from toothpaste!.&lt;br /&gt;While i don&#x27;t have any dental issues, i did notice that my teeth were less sensitive to cold!</li>
    <li> I had heard Dr. Christopher on KPFK making all sorts of claims for this powder such as it cures receding gums.  It does not seem to do this nor anything special for my teeth.  It is very messy and tastes very funky.  I think I will stick with Aim with baking soda and peroxide--far more effectative.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading all the great reviews.  Fast shipping and great customer service so I&#x27;m not complaining about the seller, this review is all about the product.  The day I received this powder, I used it the same night.  It tasted ok but does have a little &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; to it.  I continued to use the product for about 2 weeks and I do not see any difference so I decided it&#x27;s not for me.  I asked my husband to use it, so he continued for about two weeks.  I can see a little difference because his teeth got a little brighter, so I will have him to help me finish it since I don&#x27;t want it to go waste.  I will not likely purchase another one.</li>
    <li> Awful,messy does not worki ordered 2 for different people both hated</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Heals as well as cleans.</li>
    <li> Herby flavor which is fine. Be careful not to let moisture get in. Mine molded after a month and a half.</li>
    <li> This toothpowder is wonderful. It has a slightly sweet taste which leaves my teeth feeling very clean. It is green so brushing is a slight change from frothy, white traditional toothpaste.</li>
    <li> it arrived quickly.  i ordered this for my son, because he has tooth and gum problems but i have not been able to use it because he said it&#x27;s powder it feels awful in his mouth.  so i don&#x27;t know even if it works because of that.</li>
    <li> Tastes herby but it cleans very well. Also makes mouth black only while brushing LOL!  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Cleans great. It does stain your brush though.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> This stuff is my miracle! I&#x27;ve always battled with subpar dental health (thanks, genetics!) and this stuff made a huge difference within 1 week of use. Very, very good!</li>
    <li> Teeth feel great after using this.  Kind of odd using a powder, and it&#x27;s really green!  Swish your mouth out well after brushing.  It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This healed my gum issues! Amazing!</li>
    <li> As usual, Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products are the best. My sis tried mine, and bought some for herself and 2 daughters. Top quality-seller, too!</li>
    <li> It works really well..I had a lump on the inside of my jaw from getting stuck at the dentist while having s root canel and its going away.  I also see my gums growing back from my acid reflux that had them receding.  Taste isn&#x27;t so great but I got used to it.</li>
    <li> I have been having tooth pain where I had a crown done, found this product. I don&#x27;t brush with it regularly like some other people do. But when the tooth hurts I pack it around and within 5 minutes the pain is gone.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The taste takes a while to get used to but before long it becomes normal. It&#x27;s very good for your gums and I&#x27;ve noticed significant changes within one month. My gums have gone from red puffy and swollen to a lovely pink. It hasn&#x27;t fixed any of my pockets of receding gums but it&#x27;s defiantly reduced the swelling. Good product</li>
    <li> Wow. Not to repeat what others have said..but it really does seem to have a healing effect on my gums, it doesn&#x27;t taste too bad, and isn&#x27;t any messier than toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Works well but it is a brown powder so it takes a bit of time to get use to it.</li>
    <li> I did notice my gums healing while using this. However my teeth started to discolor so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Great product and my dentist even commented how healthy my teeth and gums are, especially since I hadn&#x27;t been to the dentist in over a year.</li>
    <li> Love, I don&#x27;t use toothpaste anymore and I don&#x27;t have any toothaches anymore.</li>
    <li> Great product! My teeth feel super clean and definitely seem to be in better health.</li>
    <li> I decided to give it a try based on other reviews....eh..it&#x27;s just  o.k. for me.  I mean, it did clean the teeth, but not a fan of the muddy &#x27;mess&#x27; in your mouth much less the sink.</li>
    <li> My husband has been suffering from periodontal disease for years.  I was shocked because he flosses and brushes two times a day. I read the reviews and ordered the product mainly for him.  He has been using the product for maybe 6 months.  We are ecstatic.  He has no more bleeding gums.  He is able to bite down on food without pain for the first time in years.  I can hardly wait for him to see a dentist.  I KNOW he is going to receive a good report.  The dentist had already started removing gum on the bottom quadrant of his mouth, but I know that the disease has reversed.  I will send an update as soon as I can get him back into the dentist chair.  As for myself, I had an infection starting under my bridge work.  I put some Herbal Toothpaste on a GUM bristle brush and floss it under the bridge day and evening before bed.  The swelling has subsided.  Great product.</li>
    <li> The powder  it was out in the box that come,i need another one or a refund.and the box was smelling bad.so i need another one or a refund</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. My teeth are whiter than before and I really appreciate that.</li>
    <li> I really hate this powder. Yuckie, nasty, dark staining stuff. Suffered thru using it for over a month &amp; will throw it out. There are other healthy tooth powders, such as clean white Eco-Dent powder which kept my teeth/gums very healthy &amp; nice looking, &amp; never stained my toothbrushes dark like this does. Good for you if you like it, but I DETEST it. Hate that I wasted $ on something I dislike so much. Had to constantly bleach sinks &amp; toothbrushes to remove this products&#x27; dark brown stains. It&#x27;s gross.</li>
    <li> Has helped us to maintain our toddlers tooth health.  He seems to prefer it over all other tooth cleaning &amp;#34;solutions&amp;#34; we have tried.  Try it, you may like it.</li>
    <li> I am giving 3 stars for now.  I think its working.  So far i feel that my gums are a bit tighter.  I have to give it a little more time.</li>
    <li> I really like this tooth powder and feel it has also helped my gum tissue.  It sort of stains your toothbrush but other than that I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> i have been searching for an hour on the info of how well this product works    so far i have found 0 evidence to back up their claim that it tightens gums or does anything else they claim it does    i would not recommend this product unless of course you want to gamble with the health of your gums or teeth i say go ahead</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I don&#x27;t have any dental issues, but this powder really cleans your gums well. Noticeable difference from using just toothpaste. Can be a bit messy though</li>
    <li> The taste is not to bad. Couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to see a difference. My teeth and gum became sensitive and irritated which prompt an immediate change to sensodyne. Not certain if this product was the cause but I might revisit once I get things under control.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know how it works, since the seller decided to negligently put their &amp;#34;warehouse&amp;#34; sticker on top of the directions for use! Did it not occur to them that a customer who has never used a product like this would ACTUALLY NEED to read the directions? It&#x27;s not like its self explanatory, like toothpaste or mouthwash. I tried peeling the sticker off but of course was unsuccessful and ended up ripping the label. Unbelievable. Makes me seriously wonder...</li>
    <li> I recieved this product and like most reviews it does take a lil bit to get used to but so far i like the way my teeth feel so clean and whiter after only a few days of using. I mostly got this stuff bc i have some receding gums and a lot of reviews i read says it helps ur gums. I will update in about a month and let everyone know if it helps bc its to soon to tell yet since i have only had it for a few days. So far i like this product :) __ update. I have only been using this product for couple weeks and i must say i love this product! Already ordering more :) my gums already seem to be stronger be much better and  tighter around my teeth , even seemed to have grown back a tad bit.. I have had a bit of receding gums on my lower front teeth and already see and feel a big difference... Cant wait to see what my dentist says on my next visit. Highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I had gum and teeth pain and coffee stains and this has really helped all of that,</li>
    <li> I did not like it at all - it tasted horrid - it stained my toothbrush - it was not what I expected.  I finally tossed it out.</li>
    <li> This toothpowder is the worst I have ever used. I have been using &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; toothpastes and powders for 10 years. It basically is like a Sleepytime, or cold care type herbal tea in a powdered form. Somehow I missed in the description that it is Olive Green and leaves little residue of green all over your toothbrush and in the cracks of your teeth. I have only used it for a couple weeks but I am discontinuing use because I have noticed a build up on my teeth.</li>
    <li> This tooth powder suppose to help gum stop bleeding but it doesnt, i used this powder since  i have got it, its been almost 2 to 3 weeks now. 3 star because, it has good smell, help teeth fresh(way better compare to crest/colgate extra whitening and all those craps), it does what a tooth powder should do.&lt;br /&gt;2 star less because whole purpose for me to order this product was to help my gum stop bleeing and my gum still same. :(</li>
    <li> There are small pieces of a green substance (herb?) that I see when I rinse. This is concerning to me since I have periodontal pockets and these visible green pieces might be getting stuck between my teeth. The ingredients don&#x27;t seem to be powdered enough. The flavor, green color, sink &amp; brush staining all did not bother me, but I can&#x27;t have a tooth powder that doesn&#x27;t fully dissolve. My dentist tells me to avoid foods that have small debris that can get lodged between my teeth. Unfortunately, this tooth power falls into that category. I shouldn&#x27;t have bought two containers! Not sure what to do with all this extra. My search for a good tooth powder continues...</li>
    <li> I have been using another brand and not an herbal mixture.  I don&#x27;t know if it works yet but be prepared for your toothbrush to turn nasty colored green and the dry herbal mixture when you put it on your brush is messy.  It also is a different texture than toothpaste so it is a little hard to take at first.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it because with the deep pockets I&#x27;ve had, I don&#x27;t want to go thru Osceus surgery again so I&#x27;ll do whatever it takes.  My gums feel better but I like I said, I can&#x27;t tell if it is from this or not.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> Tastes great. I add a little toothpaste to mine. My teeth have never felt cleaner</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a great product. I use it in place of toothpaste, primarily. My mouth has never felt cleaner and healthier, for sure. The taste is just fine. A bit odd the first time, but I&#x27;ve quickly grown to enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother and I have both used a pinch of this around any gums that hurt or looked inflamed overnight and they would be almost completely better by the next morning. She still thinks it&#x27;s weird to not use fluoride toothpaste from a tube, but even she had to admit this powder worked some miracles for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it does stain your toothbrush from the first use. It&#x27;s pretty gross looking, but I feel so much better about this powder than the toxic regular toothpaste I used to use, so I guess I&#x27;ll live with it! It does NOT stain your teeth, though I can&#x27;t say they look whiter, either.</li>
    <li> Without even anticipating or expecting it, I have noticed my teeth and gums look healthier since brushing with this powder for only a week or so, so I thought I would write a review. I am very prone to cavities and occasionally get small pains when eating certain foods, but I have not noticed any pain since using this powder (though that may be coincidental).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at a few options before choosing this powder, and this was the obvious choice. I knew I wanted a true herbal powder, not the glorified baking soda kind which can mess with your mouth&#x27;s PH balance. This product had a more impressive array of herbs than the other herbal tooth powders I looked at, and it&#x27;s organic to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder is nice and fine, so even if some does get lodged between your teeth, it readily dissolves - something I wouldn&#x27;t be able to recreate grinding herbs in my kitchen. It has a nice earthy, minty, medicinal taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be nice to have a more convenient way to dispense it onto the toothbrush. Right now I just dip my dry toothbrush in the jar, and I don&#x27;t think that will cause any problems, since it is dry. I might try putting the powder in a little oil and vinegar jar with a small tip opening, though I wonder if the powder would just get backed up in the tip and not dispense properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced this is the best way to brush your teeth.</li>
    <li> When I go to use it, I always place the powder on my brush and then on any sore spot in my mouth.  That seems to do the trick.  It makes the sore spot feel better right away.</li>
    <li> My teeth and gums feel great, My mom also loves this product. Worth every penny. Makes my teeth look and feel. like I just went to the dentist for a cleaning. Update: My gums and teeth feel stronger after a few months of using this powder.</li>
    <li> Teeth feel clean no plaque on your teeth . It also clean your tongue. My daughter was having a problem with one of her back teeth, started brushing with this product and around the gum area around the tooth started to strengthen and the pain  disappeared.  Great for your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> This product is very messy and it does damage to a toothbrush .. I found that if u used a spin brush it cleans better ... As for this product itself it was a waste of money ..I followed the instructions to the letter ..And after 30 days there was not a ounce of results.. Just another product with inflamed reviews from customers...</li>
    <li> I had an open mind about this product, tried it for awhile, and became not a fan of this. Does not taste good, but got over that. My teeth actually yellowed some from use of this product. Husband agreed. Will search for a better natural alternative.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: 7 24 2014 - I LOVE this stuff and put it into many of my homemade concoctions.  Everything listed in the ingredients turns out to be great for skin and hair as well.  I put 1/4 t. in my 4 oz hair pomade that I make with WAXELENE, shea butter, vegetable glycerin, essential and carrier oils.  I don&#x27;t have an exact recipe, I just use whatever feels right and look for my desired consistency.  I use 1/4 t. in my 8 oz body butters, which I sometimes use on my face.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any staining to sheets, etc., but it is ground up herbs and spices so if you&#x27;re going to follow suit, keep that in mind.  You wouldn&#x27;t want to put too much in, since ground herbs and spices likely will not sink into skin but their benefit is absorbed.  I don&#x27;t notice any residue on my skin or in my hair afterward so who knows.  Maybe it absorbs too?  I don&#x27;t know.  I do know, that our skin and hair are better.  We glow more, break out less and the texture of hair and skin (including face) is much better since using.  I am African American and the hair pomade I make with this is AWESOME.  I suppose that if one does not &#x27;grease&#x27; their scalp or hair, they could still mix some into hair conditioner.  I don&#x27;t recommend for light hair because I don&#x27;t know if it could stain.  You&#x27;d have to test that yourself.  You can also use it to make a mask for your face or add it to an already made mask or facial moisturizer.  For facial moisturizer, I&#x27;d use 1/8t or less, depending on the size of the jar.  Works excellent!  Seems to help tighten pores, smooth and soothe skin.  Less breakouts.  I believe it is helping to keep my skin young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as use for the teeth, my gums do not bleed when I use this consistently and they feel more grounded (tightened).  I had a tooth pulled and I believe it has accelerated healing.  At first my teeth seemed brighter, then began to look stained, as well as my toothbrush.  I remedied this by brushing with baking soda or toothpaste every so often.  I like Rembrandt Deeply White.  It too, does not leave any film in my mouth like many other toothpastes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the toothbrush, I learned to live with the light staining.  I rinse the brush as well as I can and soak it in blue Listerine now and again.  I also replace the brush heads more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW: I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the taste.  As soon as I opened the container, the smell of the herbs made me smile.  The aroma was very pleasant to me.  While this product is not for everyone, I enjoyed it very much and found it hard to stop brushing.  I eat LOTS of sugar.  In my tea, coffee, flavored coffee, etc.  I do use a lot of raw honey and when I buy sugar, it&#x27;s evaporated cane juice.  I buy fresh herbs a lot because my apartment does not get the sun I would need to grow them.  I do grind my own spices though, and very often.  I drink many different teas, among them, Bengal Spice at least once per week, which may explain why I like the taste of this tooth powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to update this post when I finish the container as to how well it works but so far, so good.  I like the smell, I like the taste, it rinses right off my brush so I haven&#x27;t experienced any staining to my teeth or toothbrush.  I especially like the fact that there is no white film left behind, which I always get when I use commercial paste and I can eat right away after brushing.  With commercial paste, I have to wait to eat, otherwise I can&#x27;t taste my food over all the mint, etc.  My teeth feel clean, but naturally clean.  I wish I had found this before I had a tooth pulled.  I may have been able to save it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is way overpriced because all the herbs and spices on it&#x27;s ingredient list are not expensive.  I&#x27;d make it myself if I knew what quantities to use.  As it is, I do not, so if I find that this works, I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Love this product,but my family looks at me like really.......it&#x27;s not crest tooth paste. Kinda green and powdery but works to keep&lt;br /&gt;teeth and gums healthy.</li>
    <li> Update: one month with the procedure I list below and my teeth and gums are healthier than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in horrible pain for weeks with my teeth, and all the dentist could offer was pullings, crowns etc..I tried the natural way and I am pain free. I take Vitamin C every morning with breakfast. I then floss, then I mix Dr Christopher&#x27;s tooth powder with Colgate Sensitive Pro-relief Pro-argin Toothpaste. I made a solution of half hydrogen peroxide and half water and mixed that with Listerine and I am pain free.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work well for me. Unfortunately, after a couple uses it made my teeth very sensitive. I tried using it several different times, but it would always make my teeth extremely sensitive. I couldn&#x27;t even drink tap water without it bothering me. It took a few days after I stopped using it for my teeth to not hurt whenever I ate or drank anything.</li>
    <li> Love this tooth powder</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with my teeth.  I flossed.  I brushed.  But I still would experience cavities and sensitivity to hot and cold. When I talked to my dentist and hygenist, I was told I had soft teeth and a receding gum line, and there wasn&#x27;t much I could do about it.  They tried applying some flouride to the sensitive area, but it didn&#x27;t really help.  Last year I turned 50 and realized if I didn&#x27;t do something, I may end up with false teeth before too long, and that just simply was not an option I wanted to think about.  I started doing to online research and developed a plan to care for my mouth and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Every morning before getting in the shower, I take about 1/2 TBSP of coconut oil and swish it around my mouth for about 15 minutes.  After my shower, I place a very thin layer of Xyli-white toothpaste on my brush and dip it in Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Powder.  I don&#x27;t brush hard, but I cover my teeth thoroughly and try to brush for a minute or two.  Some of the reviews say the powder stains your teeth.  I haven&#x27;t seen any of that. In fact, I think my teeth look better after a year.  You definitely have to rinse well, but your mouth feels so good afterward. In the evening I floss well, and then use a Sonicare toothbrush on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My last two visits to the dentist have been so easy.  It takes 1/2 the time it used to for the hygienist to clean my teeth and they are no longer sensitive to hold and cold foods.  I LOVE Dr. Christopher&#x27;s and plan to continue using it.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Whenever my gums start to hurt from receding gums, I reach for Dr. Christophers.  It helps so far.  I am sure eventually I will have to have the surgery.</li>
    <li> My local health food stores no longer carry this item, so I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  If you have not used this before, the texture of a powder may take some getting use to, but the benefits are so worth the adjustment! I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not putting down this product at all but I want you all to understand that you can make this same product for less then $2.00 for three times the amount with a simple search on the internet for dr christopher tooth powder recipe. No one should be profiting from his recipe. He even has a book with several recipes for toothpowders.</li>
    <li> After obtaining the tooth powder and seeing it was green, I did a google search and saw people complaining about the powder staining the teeth.  I contacted one seller and she said the powder can stain teeth, but that a dental hygenist can remove the stains.  I stopped using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White oak bark is a relatively cheap product ($2.00 a pound from an an herb store) and it will not stain the teeth.  Therefore, if you are buying this product for the benefits of white oak bark, you would be better off buying it and using it than this green looking powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this product stains the teeth,  I tried the IPSAB powder.  IPSAB cleans the teeth extremely well, but the salt content was so high that I decided I would rather not have high blood pressure.  I now use a powder made by NARA.  It has salt, but is not salty.</li>
    <li> It leaves a nice and clean feeling in your mouth! You know after you brush your teeth and food tastes gross? Well it doesn&#x27;t have that affect and my son likes that about it too!</li>
    <li> Ok, this stuff is weird getting used to so I mixed a dab of toothpaste for the first week and now I&#x27;m brushing with it alone. I think a reviewer said it stained their teeth, but not mine and I do use white strips every few days.  It did leave a slight stain on my toothbrush.  I asked my family to tell me if my breath stinks or anything since I gave up the toothpaste for this &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; alternative but so far, no complaints.  It has quite a strong taste but I got used to it pretty quickly. It&#x27;s a dark piney green powder.  Only gave it 4 stars because the container is only half way full.  I&#x27;d rather buy a smaller jar or this larger one that&#x27;s full.</li>
    <li> I seems to be helping my teeth and gums. The taste may be strange, but not distasteful.</li>
    <li> this thing is awesome! when i used it the second time the plaque that i HAD at the bottom of my mouth just came out with ease. it cleans my whole mouth, teeth, gums and tongue. Thank you so much for this product. I even mix it with my toothpaste sometimes and would use mouthwash before brushing with it... was wondering why they put 2oz in a container that can hold about 4oz lol. You should try it. My gums are so pink and healthy looking again.</li>
    <li> VASTLY IMPROVED THE SWELLING AND RECESSION OF MY GUMS. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It makes my teeth and toothbrush look really YUCKY while I&#x27;m using it... but the results are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the research which proves that the glycerine in most toothpaste is the cause of cavities and thin enamel for teeth I stopped using these (toothpastes).  I used baking soda for a year or so and liked it... but since I have so many amazing products from Christopher&#x27;s I decided to try this &amp;#34;HERBAL TOOTH&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several months of using this in the evening... my gums are tight and pink, I no longer have plaque build-up on my teeth, and my mouth smells and tastes &#x27;fresh&#x27; all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that my toothbrush looks &#x27;dirty&#x27; all the time as the product has proved impossible to fully rinse out of the tight places between bristles.  Because &#x27;HERBAL TOOTH&#x27; seems to be made up of dried and powdered herbs it is dark green... not what the public has become used to in tooth care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad Christopher&#x27;s decided to make an honest and pure product that is not a phony white color... I am more than willing to put up with a stained tooth brush</li>
    <li> this was a very new comcept to me but i actully like it a lot. does not taste bad at all, kinda like unsweet herbal tea and i drink a lot of that anyways, usually mix with a little natural toothpaste to make brushing easy</li>
    <li> When I went to my last cleaning, the hygienist couldn&#x27;t find anything to clean off of my teeth. She checked my chart to make sure that I hadn&#x27;t come in too soon. Ha! It keeps my mouth, teeth, and gums feeling like I just left the cleaning chair.</li>
    <li> I replaced my regular toothpaste with Dr Christopher&#x27;s formula to avoid fluoride mostly. The first thing I noticed when I began brushing with it is that it just plain old feels good in my mouth. My gums and teeth felt invigorated. It is an interesting feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have read about other people using it as a gumpack. I&#x27;ve never done that before so I&#x27;m not sure if I do it correctly necessarily. I just wet my finger and stick it in the powder and start putting all over the base of my teeth, right on the gum. I leave it in on my drive to work (30ish minutes) and my mouth always feels great afterwards. My only complaint is that my tongue is left with a &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; feeling after swimming in tooth powder saliva. I have, however, had similar experiences with sea salt gargling, so it might just be my tongue and not the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this stuff is great. The taste is wonderful, and it leaves my mouth feeling great. My gums also feel like they have a bit more strength and are firmer.</li>
    <li> This tooth powder is amazing! It actually changed the color of my gums from brown to pink, it has improved my breath, and reduced the pain in my gums. I recommend brushing with it 1 to 2 times a day. Sometimes I brush with regular toothpaste to remove any leftover tooth powder...</li>
    <li> I will never go back to regular toothpaste. My mouth feels soo clean !  Will definefinetly reorder. .  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this several months ago.  I also purchased another product with activated charcoal so I tend to just use whatever I am in the mood for.  I love Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Tooth and Gum powder.  It makes my mouth taste fresh and clean.  My teeth actually squeak when I brush them.  This stuff is terrific and I will buy it again.  I am allergic to most toothpastes but this product doesn&#x27;t cause hives like the toothpaste.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It also helps whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality item, been using more than a year, good oral care product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a customer review, but this worked so well I felt like I should.  My dental hygienist has been telling me for a 2 years that I have been getting more inflammation at my gum line because of plaque buildup.  I ordered this product and have been using it since March of this year.  I just had my 6 month checkup today and had a great report!  The hygienist said I had much less buildup and asked if I&lt;br /&gt;had switched toothpastes.  When I told her what I was using, she said &amp;#34;Well it&#x27;s working-keep it up!&amp;#34;  She said it also almost looked like I had&lt;br /&gt;been bleaching my teeth.  I have not.  I actually like the taste of this.  It is a little messy, but not too bad.  I put some in a jar lid, wet my toothbrush, then dip it in the powder.  I just keep repeating until it is gone.  This product is working well for me.  I am glad to have found it!</li>
    <li> great for teeth, taste&#x27;s like grass : /</li>
    <li> I started using this product, then my husband tried it, and told me to order him some, we have separate bathrooms...:)  I put a little in a small plastic tub and mix in a little salt and soda which works great also.  It isn&#x27;t hard to rinse out as a couple people have stated.  All you have to do is rinse a couple times, and it is gone.  Great and healthy product.  I tried using gel toothpaste one day,,,after being on powered, I nearly tossed my cookies.  Yuck.  We will never go back to paste again!!!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what too expect since other powders I have tried didn&#x27;t taste to great, but this one actually tastes good! My teeth and mouth feel so fresh after using it. The only problem I have is trying to get it on the toothbrush with out spilling it everywhere, but if there is a more tidy way than pouring it on, I would sure recommend it!</li>
    <li> It does turn your toothbrush green NOT YOUR TEETH! - i wet toothbrush thoroughly without shaking any water off it and dip it in the powder this way it holds enough powder. i start brushing regulary then rinse. The only way this works easy is because it mixes with your saliva and you are able to brush. Spit and rinse..leaves a clean feeling and a mild minty taste and usually my gums bleed but i havent experienced this since i started brushing with this herbal tooth powder. It does not taste bad, it does leave a clean feeling and no way it has turned my teeth green. I haven&#x27;t noticed, but my husband says hes teeth are whiter. Also i do not brush my tongue i use a scraper..hope this helps...Just wanted to mention i bought Toms fluoride free for my kids. they dont like the taste but they cope...this green powder i doubt they will use..:)</li>
    <li> very satisfied with product. gums are already starting to show improvement after 1 week of use.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product. I like to do things as natural as possible its herbs that&#x27;s what I use</li>
    <li> this was as described, I like the earthy look and taste. A bit gritty at first, tastes fine. It feels good to use something natural. It&#x27;s a powder so I wet my brush and dip it in, having to scoop a bit, but not messy or inconvenient. Has a fresh taste. I seem to read a lot of good comments on this brand so feel confident using it. Not too confident in using commercial toothpastes anymore.</li>
    <li> I did not have to use it as of yet. I am glad to own just in case I need it. Stress can cause oral issues. You need items that will help and this is one.  Make sure you read info to see if this is what you want. I asked about it. Amazon had it surprisingly was not expecting them to. Glad they did.</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks for making it. I heard of this product to help with tooth and mouth issues and I&#x27;m happy to have it.</li>
    <li> So far I think it is helping... time will tell.</li>
    <li> Make sure to read the reviews so you know what you&#x27;re getting into. It may be awesome for issues, but I&#x27;m still working up to trying it again. It&#x27;s not so much a powder as a... fluffy mix similar to alfalfa. It&#x27;s a very strange, rather yucky, tooth brushing experience. Due to all the raves I&#x27;m going to try accepting it, but wow... this is tough.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I love the way my teeth feel after brushing with this Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Tooth and Gum Powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of how disgusting it looks when you are spitting it out (and it does, indeed, look repulsive), I love the way my teeth and tongue feel afterwards, but I&#x27;ve become skeptical of how much actual good the powder does after that,  The two small cavities that I have do not seem to have improved over the several months i have been using this product; I actually feel like they may have gotten worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, my toothbrush was flat out stained by this tooth powder.  I understand that maybe it&#x27;s not doing that to my teeth, but... well, my toothbrush&#x27;s new color isn&#x27;t willing to budge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I need to do something different here with the powder?  I so wish I had been able to give it a glowing review, but maybe someone will chime in and tell me some magic step I&#x27;m missing out on that will make me change my mind!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t work well if you don&#x27;t already have a little water in your mouth! Otherwise, it clumps into an unmaleable paste. Does not appear abrasive, very nice flavour, leaves entire mouth feeling cleaner than you thought possible, and certainly cleaner than with toothpaste. Plus, a little bit goes a long way. Great product. Note, however, that it&#x27;s useful to have a facecloth on hand, because it can dribble!</li>
    <li> Love all the natural ingredients no flouride since this chemical irritates my gums.  Leaves your mouth sooooo fresh like a waterfall.  My child was hesitant to try it but then loved it because it leaves your mouth and teeth fresh, clean and energized.  Helps with bad breath too!</li>
    <li> Ok, this one does take a little getting used to. I do like it and my bleeding gums like it too!</li>
    <li> Horrible taste and consistency.  Tasted like I was brushing my teeth with dirt and grass.  Very clumpy.  Makes a mess of your sink as well.  I much prefer TheraNeem Neem Tooth Powder over this one.</li>
    <li> Mouth feel clean and fresh but does reverse gum disease</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now. First, I brush my teeth using the herbal twice a day ( morning/night ).  Yes, it will discolor your toothbrush.  Then I flossed. Then I follow a regular toothpaste with a different toothbrush.  So I have two toothbrushes.  Then I used a mouthwash ( ACT ) to gargle.  This is my daily routine.  So the herbal freshens your breath and it has a minty smell.  The first time I used this herbal made me puked but It just a matter of time to get used to it. I have been using this product because it helped my gums that bleeds.  And now I have observed that it quit bleeding.  So I will continue to get and order this herbal product in the future.  It takes time and patience but there is a good result. This is from my experience.</li>
    <li> This really works. My gums started to look like I have periodontal problems. I started to use this product . I was brushing with it and also I left it on my gums for the night. In about 1 week I noticed the difference.&lt;br /&gt;My gums looked pink and healthy again. Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  My teeth and gums feel very clean.  My mouth feels very refreshed and herbally.  I quite enjoy the flavor. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It takes some time getting use to, but it works. My teeth feel cleaner than ever when I use this.</li>
    <li> Dr. Christophers Herbal Tooth &amp; Gum Powder 2 Oz</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews even though I do read them almost always. This time I had to share my experience with this product. I went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. I have to get the gas (the max) to have this procedure done. Cant stand metal scraping on my teeth. While under gas,  I be totally gone. Anyway when dentist came in to inspect I heard him say, &#x27;lets watch #30,31,32 all three are loosing. And #14 guns are starting to recede. I had already made known about the gums but had not felt the effects of loosing teeth. Well a few months passed and boy did they ever start to loosen. I could only eat on one side which caused pain on the what I consider as the good side. I got to researching and ran across Dr. Christopher&amp;#34;s product. All I can say Is WOW. After a week of usage (brushing and packing my tooth and gums at night) this product is a life saver. I can not imagine EVER going back to regular toothpaste and mouthwash. I did use Melrose essential oil as well for the gums.</li>
    <li> Works really well if you have gum problems.</li>
    <li> My 1 year old loves it with a little coconut oil!</li>
    <li> Beautiful product. Well thought out ingredients. Incredible quality. Tastes like a green drink.</li>
    <li> I have been using a liquid gum treatment with a special brush and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I really am not crazy about it.  It&#x27;s pretty messy and really doesn&#x27;t feel as invigorating as my liquid gum Rejuv.</li>
    <li> Great for tooth remineralization! Along with cell salts, FCLO, and a CTD diet, this tooth powder has helped me remineralize my teeth and heal my cavities. A little bit goes a long way! We mix with coconut oil for brushing and even my toddler loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. A great herbal tooth powder with a refreshing taste, and it is non-abrasive to the user.</li>
    <li> I definitely have very sensitive teeth and gums, especially when I use commercial toxic toothpaste which would cause me to have mouth sores and all kinds of discomfort. I switched to Tom&#x27;s toothpaste and have been using it for 4 yrs but wasn&#x27;t so satisfied with its natural whitening/stain removing power. I came across this dr. Christopher&#x27;s Formula brand on Amazon... I could not believe how well this green powder works! I noticed a difference within the 2nd day my teeth looked cleaner/whiter. This container has lasted me over 6 months so far and counting! Aside from sensitivity pain after dentist visits ((fill ins) and super cold beverages and ice cream... I have not had pain or mouth sores using this product. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I think this product is awesome. Just came back from a dentist office. I&#x27;ve been having problems with my gums for a loooong time (bleeding,inflammation,very dip pockets, and even some teeth became loose). I had a procedure done recently to make pockets  smaller. I began to use this powder a couple moths prier to a procedure and still continue. Dentist was soooo impressed that he could not believe his eyes. He said that my gums condition is &amp;#34;great&amp;#34;.  I have to admit  that to addition to this product I use the water flossier daily and PerioWash mouth wash.  I hope they all together work for me.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 oz container lasts very long. Unfortunately I spilled a half, but a second half is on my 4-Th month of using and I still have enough for another maybe month or so. I highly recommend this product and will order again.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s green and a little messy,but teeth feel very clean and without any stain.</li>
    <li> OK - this is messy to use. I find the taste to be pleasant but I am not sure how you are supposed to use it. I mix a dab of my regular toothpaste with this product to keep it on the brush and in my mouth. I put some in a pinch-bowl because I don&#x27;t want to dunk a wet toothbrush into the powder. That seems to be working. If my dentist says she notices an improvement when I next visit, I will most likely order again.</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago and tried it but it just made a mess, staining my toothbrush and everything else it touched! The only other way to use it, according to the directions is to place it in the mouth while you sleep. That&#x27;s just crazy! Clearly you&#x27;ll just swallow it.&lt;br /&gt;A couple years later I tried mixing it in coconut oil and holding that in my mouth while I did my morning work. As little as five minutes or as long as an hour. This method pulls out the parasites living in your mouth. This method does also stain if you have a mouth like mine with receding gums and exposed roots. Any parts that aren&#x27;t covered with good enamel will stain but this staining is easily removed and eventually goes away completely. I&#x27;ve been working on my teeth/gum health for many years now and this method has helped the most! I can finally say that my gum infections is finally healed! Other good products I&#x27;ve used are GSE and Sodium Chlorite (mms).</li>
    <li> This is a great product. When you brush with this, it does make your teeth feel super clean. The taste you have to get use to...but just while brushing.</li>
    <li> Best stuff out there, I will never go back to regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week after reading reviews thought it would make a difference .I have bad periodontal disease and a loss bottom tooth I have been brushing with it and every night packing on gums no difference .I was really hoping it would work really dissapointed .</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an alternative to glycerin filled tooth paste in an effort to naturally heal a small cavity.  My teeth have never felt cleaner!  The first time I brushed with it, my teeth felt so slick and clean.  I use it in place of regular tooth paste along with a waterpik to rinse any additional food between my teeth.  I don&#x27;t mind the flavor at all (you get used to it quickly) but it will stain your sink and toothbrush.  Initially after using this for a few weeks, I started to notice some brown staining on my front teeth, which was a little disconcerting.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is staining from the tooth powder or just regular food stains that aren&#x27;t being removed as they once were with my Toms of Maine paste I had been using.  I did some research and found that brushing with a capsule of activated charcoal immediately removed all stains and when I rinsed, my teeth were a dazzling white!  I have also been oil pulling every other day with coconut oil.  Now that I know these stains are easily removed, I am very pleased with this product!!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I think I would prefer using dirt to this stuff.  It tastes awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to give it one star, but my friend uses it and thinks it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stains your toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot mix this with baking soda.</li>
    <li> I rated this low because it is so messy &amp; stains my toothbrush.  It does feel good on my gums for a few minutes &amp; the taste is ok but just too unpleasant to use on a daily basis especially on a busy schedule.</li>
    <li> different but pleasant</li>
    <li> I alternate between this and neem oil to brush my teeth. This product gives my mouth a very clean, tingling feeling.</li>
    <li> Works well, dosen&#x27;t tast too bad (my toddlers can tolerate it LOL) but it will stain your teeth after prolonged use.</li>
    <li> I combined some of the powder with equal portions of baking soda.  I like that mixture better than just the powder alone.</li>
    <li> My gums were starting to recede and I had read some where about this and I bought it and it worked.  I no longer have the problem.</li>
    <li> The taste isn&#x27;t GOOD, but it isn&#x27;t horrible either. Kind of like grass shaving combined with a bit of anise. What I love is that my teeth feel SUPER CLEAN afterwards, and I LOVE that, so the taste is worth it to me. I use it with a drop of Oil of Oregano for super cleaning power.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time. Will stain brush if not rinsed well after each use.</li>
    <li> Giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s too messy for my taste but does produce results. My teeth are whiter now due to this powder. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this powder.  After only three weeks, a little calculus on the back of one tooth disappeared.  And after two months, my teeth are at least a shade whiter.  I didn&#x27;t think I was having gum problems, but my gums even feel firmer to me.  I never imagined I would have noticeable results, so I&#x27;m really happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using it with my old Desert Essence Neem/Tea Tree toothpaste because I had a whole tube left, but I&#x27;d been using that for a few years and hadn&#x27;t seen improvements until I added this powder to it.  And I love the flavor.  I thought my toothpaste was a little lackluster, so this adds a little kick--don&#x27;t worry, not a lot and my breath is nice and fresh after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take some of the negative comments with a grain of salt.  Yes, it IS green.  Horrors!  Plant material.  Do your salads, spices, etc. turn your teeth green after putting them in your mouth?  Also, my toothbrush still rinses clear after I use it and I always rinse the sink out when I&#x27;m done, even if using a plain white toothpaste, so why is it a big deal?  I&#x27;ve never had any stuck between my teeth either.  Okay, YMMV, but really . . .</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes but honestly I prefer my own homemade toothpaste over this. I&#x27;m not real pleased with the fact that the discoloration does not come out of your toothbrush after washing it.</li>
    <li> This brown powder does taste okay, and it leaves my mouth tingly somewhat. What I don&#x27;t like about it is, my teeth seem slightly yellowed now, after using it for several weeks. It does take care of the irritation I feel sometimes on one tooth in particular. The little pain flair ups I get are soothed within a half hour or so after brushing with this stuff. I do like that!</li>
    <li> Please, you have to read the directions before buying. It is POWDER. It definitely works, but remember it is POWDER.</li>
    <li> I got this powder because I was looking for an alternative to toothpaste, since they contain glycerin, which coats your teeth and prevents them from remineralizing and such.&lt;br /&gt;The powder itself is not unpleasant, although it takes some getting used to.  Its almost like brushing your teeth with spices as it contains cloves and different tree barks.  It definitely will stain your toothpaste and leave unpleasant looking brownish streaks in your sink if you dont rinse the sink out right away (my husband and daughter are fond of not rinsing the sink)&lt;br /&gt;Basically you run your toothbrush under the water, dip it into the powder, and brush away like normal.  Once you spit and rinse, a slight taste of cloves still remains in your mouth which is actually nice and your teeth feel nice and squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it at first and thought i would never use toothpaste again.&lt;br /&gt;However, after a couple weeks it seemed that a couple hours after brushing my teeth, they woukd be slimy and dirty feeling again.  It even made me have bad breath throughout the day and especially bad morning breath.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this product but I cant deal with brushing every 2 hours.</li>
    <li> Great results with this product gums feel and look great</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few months now, and I can&#x27;t say enough good things. Had an infected salivary gland (which was weird given my religious brushing/flossing), and I tried this to help clear it up. Worked like a charm, and I don&#x27;t use toothpaste any more. Have terrible receding gums as well, but now I have no sensitive spots and my gums haven&#x27;t hurt in months.</li>
    <li> I am meticulous about my teeth and am always looking for something natural.  This is good.  It does not taste bad and is not difficult to use.  I wet my toothbrush and dip it into the powder.  It will stain your toothbrush but I store mine in mouthwash and peroxide so that is not a problem.  It does look green on teeth but does not stain them.  My teeth are already white so am not sure about the whitening ability but it does seem to reduce plaque. My 15-year old son likes it too.</li>
    <li> This thing is hard to use.  Wish they made a toothpaste version of this stuff.  Originally, I just poured a little into a cup, added water and mixed it. Used it to brush my teeth and felt very weird. I avoided contact with my tongue as to avoid gagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it to see if I notice any improvements with my gums.  I might try mixing it with my natural toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how SAFE this is for the gums. It&#x27;s pretty rough if you don&#x27;t mix it with water.</li>
    <li> Very effective for tooth and gum issues.  I&#x27;m using it for a tooth which my dentist said I needed a root canal.  However, I am trying this powder because I read on a previous review that this helped.  Also my husband had gum issues and since he has been using this powder his dental hygienist said his teeth were tighter and his gums had improved.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely completely different than any typical paste and even other tooth powders I&#x27;ve used, but I really love it. You have to spend a little more time rinsing, but that basically just shows you how much time you didn&#x27;t rinse your mouth out in the past. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I had tried a couple of other Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products and been so thrilled with them.  When I read about this product I decided to try it.  I thought it might taste terrible but found it quite pleasant tasting.  My teeth and gums feel so clean, I love brushing with this product.  I have only used it for a little over a week but expect it to help my receding gums.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that goes along with the organic and wholesome lifestyle. I remember as a kid trying to figure out what they sweetened toothpaste with but never finding out. Lol, no Internet. However, even as an adult I didn&#x27;t give a thought to what was in it until recently. Consumers need to seriously consider what is marketed for personal care. It can be as unhealthy as some of the foods we eat.  I read all the reviews before I purchased this product and am so happy I believed the positive comments.  There were some who didn&#x27;t like that it turned their toothbrushes brown. The cure for that is to let your bristles sit in something like peroxide after rinsing. And I do not mind the taste although, for me, they could leave out the stevia. But even that is not overpowering.  I had a root canal prior to my first use. It bothered me as it was a bit loose. My dentist will fix it but in the meantime using the Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Tooth powder tightened up the area surrounding it and relieved the slight tingling.  My breath stays fresh all day and my teeth feel smooth and healthy.  Update: I&#x27;ve used it for a year and recently went for a dental cleaning. I asked the technician if she thought my teeth needed brightening also and she said, no, it didn&#x27;t appear to be needed. So the color of the powder does not stain and darken.</li>
    <li> The powder has a pleasant taste and is a good alternative to processed toothpaste. I have already shared it with many family members with various gum and teeth issues and waiting to hear positive results.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son. He hated the taste, texture, smell and most of all his teeth and tongue were left bright green even after brushing with regular tooth paste!</li>
    <li> No more bad breath in the morning! :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff. When I was using conventional toothpaste my gums were slightly red and would bleed every time I would brush my teeth. After using this product for about two weeks my gums went from red and bleeding to completely salmon pink and totally firm and no bleeding at all when brushing my teeth!! They are also a lot whiter and they feel as hard as a rock! Will be buying more when I need it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this about every other day and have seen much improvement in my gums. It does taste a little funky and take a little getting used to but it works. My tooth brush looks disgusting now but it&#x27;s worth it. I definitely will continue to use this. My gums were looking rough at my previous dentist appointment and at my most recent my dentist was really impressed at my progress.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! For those of you who say the taste is bad you sure have weird taste buds!</li>
    <li> I was really nervous to try this because of the reviews that mentioned the awful taste and teeth staining but I ordered it anyways because of the great benefits. I found no problem with the taste. It is a little bit sweet and doesn&#x27;t taste the way it looks!  It doesn&#x27;t taste like a green juice/smoothie or herbal at all. It&#x27;s more mild than I was expecting, but I am not sensitive to taste. I take cod liver oil/butter oil so this is much better tasting!  Now for how this tooth powder  works...well it&#x27;s great!!  I have noticed that on teeth that enamel was wearing down (not as smooth as other teeth) have smoothed right out and the enamed has filled in. Also, two very small holes on the sides of molars (cavities) have started filling in. I can&#x27;t feel them with my tounge any more!</li>
    <li> Very Effective, Pleasant taste.</li>
    <li> I retuned this it was So messy dirty to use! But had to give it 3 stars, cause I think his other products are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only bought this from other reviews, and buying other Dr. Christophers herbs, and liking them.&lt;br /&gt;I do not really have a gum problem, but I my dentist said my gums where starting to reseed! Yipssss...&lt;br /&gt;This might be great stuff, but it&#x27;s like dirt in a jar...I would not use my electric tooth brush with this.I did use a new regular tooth brush, cause it&lt;br /&gt;Turns it a brown dirt color.&lt;br /&gt;After using this 2,3 times, never again...I had to wash my sink and everything after every use...I&#x27;m done .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said , if anyone knows of something less messy, Please share?</li>
    <li> IM  still not sure... I like how it makes my teeth feel and is non irritating to the gums..as far as enamel  repair is concerned.. Time will tell</li>
    <li> )Ike the product, shipped in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t do toothpaste anymore because we don&#x27;t like to be poisoned.. I instead run a wet tooth brush across an organic bar soap and brush..Then a few times a week I will brush with baking soda..I always follow up by swishing peroxide 2% in my mouth as long as I can stand it then spit it out.. my husband won&#x27;t do that so I purchase him this tooth powder and he likes it.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;ve been using the tooth and gum powder for only 2 weeks and have noticed teeth look whiter. Bleeding is less, but not yet gone.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel really clean after using this product. I have tried for years to stay away from any toothpaste with glycern in it. Only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the taste after brushing, but I can certainly live with that!</li>
    <li> I really thought I could stand the taste of this... just by reading the reviews others got past it, but man o man, it is like brushing your teeth with grass! I was hoping to stick with it for the benefits, but gag is the word here!</li>
    <li> This product is a little more gentle then the Monkey Brand tooth powder so I think it is more of an everyday cleaner and I enjoy the taste</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for about a month and a half....2 of my teeth that were bothering me, dont bother me whatsoever now. Its not the best tasting stuff, but after words there is a nice minty tase. I do always need to flood after each use because the stuff sometimes gets stuck between your teeth. I love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the taste or the brown messiness in the sink and down my chin. It seemed to irritate the inside of my mouth as well.</li>
    <li> Really like this formula tooth powder.  Probably will keep using&lt;br /&gt;it for a long time.  Just like the cleaning and the way it feels&lt;br /&gt;afterwords.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, yes, your teeth and toothbrush will be green from the herbs, but it does not stay that way!  You&#x27;ll rinse or swallow the herbs away.  My loose and painful tooth got better in a week!  Now I use it five days on and two days off, my teeth are better than they&#x27;ve been in a long time and I can chew on both sides of my mouth!</li>
    <li> It tastes like chai tea, don&#x27;t be afraid!  Teeth feel very clean after brushing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have a good experience with this tooth powder. It&#x27;s messy, it stains everything including your teeth, countertops and toothbrush. Luckily I stopped using it after a week so it didn&#x27;t do too much damage. It also taste horrible. There are a lot better natural tooth care products out there to waste your time with this one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this when I got into oil pulling and tried to go a la natural with my oral hygiene products. I used it for few months, and while it made me feel good about using a natural product for brushing my teeth, it was messy, I had to assign a separate toothbrush for it, and hide it in my medicine cabinet, because it looked gross being in the open, and I did not even want to imagine what visitors would think if they had to use my bathroom and see a toothbrush in that condition. Eventually I stopped using it. 2 days ago, I had a horrible toothache, but my dentist was closed that day. I know what the problem was with my tooth, it happened 2 years ago and I went to a dentist to find out it was a crown that was done incorrectly, it was causing a pain and needed to be redone. Since I didn&#x27;t have insurance, I asked the dentist for a pain killer, which had cost me $100 (the trip to the dentist) plus whatever I paid for the medicine. Fast forward 2 years ago, the pain returned with a vengeance. I now have insurance but it was a Sunday, my dentist closes Mondays and I already had an appointment for Thursday, which I thought if I still suffer by Tuesday, I will call and see if I can see the dentist right away. I had to get creative with home remedies, until then. I thought of this product and seeing someone here mention that it helps with toothaches. I decided to try it. It started working right away, within 30 minutes, the pain was completely gone. I brushed my teeth with it, after rinsing it all out, I put the powder on the gum/tooth where the pain is. Did that in the morning, and in the evening and I&#x27;m no longer in pain. Even my swollen gum went down. Truly amazing. I had to share this. It&#x27;s really worth having even if for this purpose only.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I highly recommend it to everyone and anyone!  Especially people with teeth... :) Or gums!&lt;br /&gt;My toddler likes it as well.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Clean my teeth well and feels good. Prefer it to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. The taste does not bother me as I take a million herbal supplements and some taste worse than this. My teeth look great and my gums are much stronger.</li>
    <li> A great product if you ever have or you kids have problems with absesses or any kind of mouth sore, or those white pimple like things that come up on your gums. This product is awsome!</li>
    <li> Funky stuff, makes your mouth look like you have been eating muddy grass while brushing. Overall seemed to clean my teeth, but very hard to rinse all the powder particles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with my teeth and gums for years they would bleed now they have stopped bleeding after 10 days of using Dr. Christopher&#x27;s tooth powder and they look a lot healthier.</li>
    <li> i have had 21 implant surgeries. This powder has given me immediate relief from the nagging pain in my gums and the deep throbbing pain when i eat cold foods or I am in the wind.. i was in the wind for 5 hours today and did not experience any pain-a miracle. The flavor is good to me.  he adds a little stevia to sweeten the herbal taste. Mild and easy to use. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend. I take great care of my teeth, but always have had tooth pain from recession. The pain is now gone and my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> The can that I received looks like a used item. The seal is broken when I opened the box. The powder got all over the box. There is only half of the powders left in the can. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cleans better than traditional toothpaste, no chemicals, and a little goes a long way. My husband and I love it!</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this product until I came across it on Amazon. After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try. I was surprised that I love the herbal taste of it. It isn&#x27;t minty, but my teeth and mouth feel very clean. I noticed that when I used it (twice) after eating garlic naan, it completely got rid of any garlic odor or aftertaste. My regular toothpaste never does. Also, my teeth are noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only tried it overnight once, but I will do it again, because my teeth have never felt better. My only complaint is that it is messy in my sink, but I can live with that.</li>
    <li> Sucks....What good is it for preventing gum decay from food and bacteria getting stuck in your gum line when the tooth powder itself does the same thing! If you don&#x27;t mind looking like you just ate a mouthful of dried oregano when you go to work then this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;There are many other similar products out there that are better.</li>
    <li> I love it... for me I use it as a mouthwash before brushing the rest out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a bit in a cup of water and mix... then swish around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trying to put it in your mouth without mixing in water first, guess what happens - you accidentally inhale the fine powder and that is NOT FUN.&lt;br /&gt;Take my advice and premix small amount for your oral care.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my mouth fresh, and doesn&#x27;t taste bad. My only complaint would be the green stain left on my brush, but it is not a big deal. 2 Ounces is definitely enough for 1 year. Great price.</li>
    <li> turned my teeth black... I had to return. But I love almost everything from Dr. Christopher... just don&#x27;t like this product color.</li>
    <li> Very healing almost warm when I first used it.</li>
    <li> When i opened the package it was clearly a brown herbal powder. The smell was light to moderate earthy but pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice so far in different methods suggested:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first time I used it as a paste after I brushed my teeth with toothpaste. It was an interesting, yet pleadant, numbing sensation. The earthy smell translated to an earthy taste but I found that completely tolerable.  The taste was also good and had the warmth of clove or cinnamon with none of the spice. After a few minutes I spit it out in the sink, rinsed my mouth a few times and was done. None of my teeth nor the sink stayed or remained brown. In fact after the initial spit there were only a few flecks on my teeth which rinsing took care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I dipped my dry toothbrush with some toothpaste on it in the powder, enough to coat the toothpaste, then sprinkled some water on it. The numbing sensation wasn&#x27;t as noticeable as using a powder to paste mix but it was there. The flavor and smell when I spit was faint as well. Rinsed mouth and bowl and was on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;  My gums did not swell or become irritated when i used this.&lt;br /&gt;  For the first try i did use a different toothbrush to see how brown it would go. It was not bad at all, but it did turn a light brown and i can see that overtime it would get browner. For the second try i used my regular toothbrush because if it gets so bad i could easily buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;  The numbing sensation was an awesome experience and stuck around for a good 30 min or so which didn&#x27;t bother me. Would definitely recommend if you get tooth/gum soreness/pain and need a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;  You don&#x27;t need much of the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update progress later on bit first impressions count and I say give it a try.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this. It actually irritated my gums very bad, they seemed to recede further quickly. They also stained my teeth (but this went away after a few days of discontinuing use)... I am not trying to promote any products, but I have been using Oralive with great results. I was hoping this would work wonders because Oralive is pretty expensive. At least I know now.</li>
    <li> When you open this and look at it, you might back a way but give it a try. It leaves my mouth fresh and clean. It is like putting a bunch of crushed herbs in your mouth, I always rinse really well afterwards. I use this product daily</li>
    <li> Very effective. Really helps!</li>
    <li> I like this product. The taste is little weird and I have to wait a while to see the result.</li>
    <li> I had some swelling in my gums that was starting to get painful, but I figured I&#x27;d risk trying something alternative as a first resort. Turned out to be a pretty good call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me add that I used this in conjunction with oil pulling (where you swish a tablespoon of coconut oil in your mouth for 10-20 minutes), so some of my imputed dental health might be grim that. But I can tell you that this powder is in the process of transforming my mouth. My gums look and feel better, as do my teeth.  All I do is pack it against my gums (while it&#x27;s dry) and let it sit there for a few minutes while I read. Then I use what&#x27;s in my mouth to brush my teeth. Even my boyfriend likes it, and he&#x27;s not into natural remedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the taste, I actually like it - it&#x27;s mostly just clove. Another review suggested adding cinnamon to mask the flavor, which I also wanted to try out of curiosity, and that just made it taste like Christmas, so I&#x27;m happy with that, too.</li>
    <li> Whitens and brightens teeth. I had only been using it for a week when someone asked me if I had been whitening. I explained that I was not using traditional methods of whitening and they were just as impressed with the results as I was.  My boss actually turned me on to this product.</li>
    <li> I just started using it three days ago but so far I like it. It really makes my mouth feel clean. The taste is not as bad as I expected. The powder is real light and fluffy. As of now, I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite tooth powder, but an economical choice. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean, and the green color doesn&#x27;t bother me. It doesn&#x27;t stain the teeth. If anything, my teeth look much whiter since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. My toothache was gone immediately. Unlike other posts no residue on my brush after I rinsed it.</li>
    <li> This tooth powder Is great! I got it because I wanted to switch off of fluoride based toothpaste. Not only does it make your mouth feel naturally clean it also has made my teeth a couple of shades lighter almost instantly. The taste is unusual at first but you get used to it. It also can make a mess if your not careful while brushing. And about what other people were saying about it making your teeth green you just need to rinse your mouth out really well afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6-8 months now, spreading a very thin layer of toothpaste on my toothbrush, then dipping the toothbrush into a smaller container of the herbal powder (not the container it comes in), to coat it.  It tastes and sticks better that way.  Hopefully it is helping my gums, though they were ok to begin with, so it&#x27;s hard to say if the powder has made a difference.  I use it more as prevention.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Just add to it the comfrey to it, that&#x27;s what will make this work 100% better!</li>
    <li> ive been using this instead of regular tooth paste every day and i have no more tooth aches. it tastes minty and delicious too!</li>
    <li> This is not the minty flavored toothpaste we&#x27;re used to, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used so far. I stopped buying fluoride toothpaste a couple years ago and then started making my own using betonite clay, but I still had problems with my gums. After a week of using this herbal toothpaste my gums no longer bleed. I&#x27;m so happy with this result alone, but I&#x27;m sure that as time goes by I&#x27;ll see more.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! My teeth feel SO clean!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m particularly sensitive to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (a common ingredient in most toothpastes). I was looking all over for a toothpaste without SLS, but even Tom&#x27;s of Maine has it as an ingredient!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found this product. It&#x27;s all natural and organic so I don&#x27;t have to worry about dousing my mouth with chemicals every day.&lt;br /&gt;The taste is very earthy. There is a bit of stevia so it&#x27;s got a sweet-ISH aftertaste to it. I read a review that likened it to unsweetened teas, I think that is a fair comparison. It may be a bit of an adjustment to those who are used to having that strong mint-taste in their toothpaste, but it is so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel so clean all day long I wish I had found this sooner!</li>
    <li> Weird, but in a healthy way</li>
    <li> This is a miraculous powder. I have always had problems with my gums (hereditary) and now they look healthy and never bleed during flossing.</li>
    <li> Life time of smoking, coffee drinking, soda&#x27;s &amp; now menopause has taken it&#x27;s toll on my teeth &amp; gums. In just two months my gums look much healthier &amp; my teeth are whiter. When I brush my teeth I also massage it on my gums with a soft bristle toothbrush &amp; then rinse after my shower in the morning &amp; I don&#x27;t rinse at night. I am somewhat anal (anal &amp; teeth should never be in the same sentence...lol)  about my teeth &amp; usually brush 4-5 times a day so I may have seen results faster than some will.  Makes a horribly ugly mess in the sink but, well worth it. Unlike a lot of the reviews, I do not have a problem with it turning my toothbrush green, but again, I am somewhat anal.&lt;br /&gt;My husband had scratched his gum &amp; it had become infected. It was too late to get into the dentist &amp; he had taken several Tylenol before I could convince him to pack some of the powder on his gums. By morning he could not believe the relief it had given him &amp; decided he did not need to see the dentist for antibiotics. Will never be without this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using &amp;#34;Squiggle Tooth Builder&amp;#34; toothpaste (also from Amazon) and the tarter (dentists call it calculus, and it&#x27;s what the dental scrape off when they clean your teeth) has been greatly reduced. Lately I have been adding Dr Christopher&#x27;s to the Squiggle and the tarter on my teeth has been reduced even further. Plus it tastes great!</li>
    <li> stops gums from bleeding; good stuff; but makes a brush look dirty; keep it away from others to see :)</li>
    <li> I have no morning breath when I use this! Amazing. It takes getting used to, but the powder texture and color do not bother me one bit.  I actually enjoy the taste too... it is like cloves.  The only thing is that it is PRICEYYY!!!</li>
    <li> :My family loves this toothpaste, its refreshing and leaves your teeth feeling really clean.</li>
    <li> I did not see any improvement.  Won&#x27;t rebuy.</li>
    <li> Great taste, a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I have been using a fluoride free toothpaste with CoQ10 for a while and a homemade mouthwash with sea salt and tea tree oil (I am not very consistent with this last one so it does not take much credit.) I guess I was in a money-spending mood when I ordered Herbal Tooth Powder and I have to say that it is one of the best purchases I have made. It will stain the toothbrush- there is no questioning that- but it will not stain your teeth; on the contrary, they will become whiter. The taste is funny at first, but I grew to like it (reminds me of exotic India.) It is a little bit messier than using a toothpaste so I like to use it at night, but this is my fault as I can never wake up early enough. After using this regularly every night, my teeth are whiter, I do not have tartar build-up, no cavities (I used to have a terrible dentist that destroyed my teeth with unnecessary fillings so he could make more money hence I have to be really careful for new cavities) and the isolated gingivitis is gone. I highly recommend this product- at least it works for me.</li>
    <li> I got this paste after researchinng natural choices for my sons cavity, we have  been using it for about a month now and his ugly, bigger black cavity has turned to a medium brown. My husband and I can both see it&#x27;s helping heal his mouth and we are amazed. It&#x27;s not the best tasting tooth paste but once I explained to my 6 yr old what it was doing he has been willing twice daily... Impressed.</li>
    <li> I love the flavor it leaves in my mouth after I brush.  It doesn&#x27;t make my drink taste bad either (sweet tea).  The best part is I see a tiny regrowth of receding gums.  That&#x27;s better than nothing.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff in place of tooth paste.</li>
    <li> My first reaction upon putting this in my mouth was &#x27;powdered minty broccoli.&#x27;  Within seconds though, that prejudice against anything &#x27;green&#x27; dissipated and I was pleasantly surprised at the tingle and spicy, minty flavor.  I&#x27;ve grown fond of it.  It&#x27;s warm and spicy, a hint of salt, with a minty, tingly, long-lasting taste.  It cleans better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.  It&#x27;s kind of a novel product that has really grown on me!  Even my kids like it, and they don&#x27;t like anything new.  Especially something as edgy as this - I wasn&#x27;t sure if they&#x27;d like it or think they were brushing with dried grass.  Since my 4 year old routinely eats toothpaste because it tastes soooo good, I figured A) something natural is better and B) if she doesn&#x27;t like the taste, she won&#x27;t eat it.  Well, both my kids enjoy brushing with it, so I figure that&#x27;s endorsement enough. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be able to comment on whether it reverses sensitivity and other maladies, but I&#x27;m hoping.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to try and see if it would aid in saving my teeth!  I&#x27;ve been plagued with tooth decay despite taking excellent care of my mouth.  I&#x27;ve now turned to using alternative tooth pastes and focusing on my nutrition more.&lt;br /&gt;This tooth powder, although it looks yucky compared to normal toothpaste! , actually makes my mouth feel fresh....and has whitened my teeth too!</li>
