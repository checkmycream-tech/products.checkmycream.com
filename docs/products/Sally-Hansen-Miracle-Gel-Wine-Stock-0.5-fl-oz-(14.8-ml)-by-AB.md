### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s the greatest nail invention ever.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worked for me beautifully.</li>
      <li>But it may be ideal to buy you more time when you just can&#x27;t get to the salon.</li>
      <li>good-</li>
      <li>Two coats did not give good coverage</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite pretty and perfect for fall.  </li>
      <li>So, Miracle Gel is amazing.</li>
      <li>The product goes on smoothly and it looks nice; until it chips after 2 days.</li>
      <li>I like it more than Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay Gel Envy because it has yet to bubble when I apply it</li>
      <li>I love the shade.</li>
      <li>There are kits with colors not sold separately that come with the top coat and sell for about $16.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure to use the special top coast!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I could go the full two weeks if I were more patient.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to change colors.</li>
      <li>As a nail tech I always wonder how things will work when no base coat is required or recommended.</li>
      <li>the Polish did stay a full 14 days with</li>
      <li>The first time I used the polish it went on mostly smooth</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not any better than regular polish in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>Still better than regular polish.  </li>
      <li>so may try this brand again in different color but had better application with Revlon.</li>
      <li>I had to do multiple coats of the color, and then after I applied the top coat, it smudged (not chipped) after a 5 hours of it &#x27;drying&#x27;.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t even realize that it had a second step wich is the top coat</li>
      <li>This is more so a review of the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel line as opposed to a specific color.</li>
      <li>It just isn&#x27;t as shiny nor as cheap as Revlon (only $5.00).</li>
      <li>The color is very pretty, dark and rich.</li>
      <li>Just purchased and applied this color and the no light gel top coat for the first time.</li>
      <li>I used to do nails, so I am extremely particular with how my nails look.</li>
      <li>I had really High hopes for this since It cost 10 dollars for the color and 10 dollars for the topcoat.</li>
      <li>Definitely works better than regular polish but not sure if thats attributed to the top coat or a combination of the two.  </li>
      <li>The only issue I see is that the color range is limited, which I&amp;#34;m sure the company will rectify as the product gains in popularity.  </li>
      <li>and I seriously thought that the higher the cost thhe better quality.</li>
      <li>It lasted 2 days on me and my 26 yr old daughter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m interested to see if the product stays on as long as it&#x27;s claims.</li>
      <li>One nail the polish completely came off.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this color and Miracle Gel in particular.  </li>
      <li>I tried a blue color first and the same results happened so</li>
      <li>I rarely wear dark polishes on my nails</li>
      <li>I do use the Miracle Gel top coat every few days because the shine dulls, but</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not impressed and actually regret buying 4 different colors before trying it out :-(</li>
      <li>So it doesn&#x27;t last nearly 14 days</li>
      <li>because I inevitably will get chips, which are really noticeable with dark colors.  </li>
      <li>I gave it two tries, but it only lasted about 12 hours longer than a normal nail polish.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be taking it off due to the streaking, but it doesn&#x27;t offer a real professional look.</li>

<li> Can&#x27;t say how long it last yet.</li>
<li> I have the SHMG in a reddish pink color, and it did last a lot longer than regular polish.  </li>
<li> I really feel like there would be a more even polish application if the nail was primed with a base coat.</li>
<li> I bought several colors but have only tried the 470 Red Eye so far (BTW, not real impressed with the selection).&lt;br</li>
<li> I painted my toes late last night, wore open toed shoes today, and the big toe already shows wear this afternoon.  </li>
<li> though not a high shine like the salon.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
<li> Not very glossy and shiny.</li>
<li> A deep burgundy with very little purple.  </li>
<li> other than that, I don&#x27;t baby my manicure.  </li>
<li> I was not satisfied with this &amp;#34;miracle gel&amp;#34; the only miracle that I see</li>
<li> I have three other colors, all of which are neutrals, so I decided to go for it and try a dark one.  </li>
<li> But Miracle Gel simply doesn&#x27;t chip for at least 10 days.  </li>
<li> In the drugstore, the polishes sell for anywhere between $8 and $10, much less than on Amazon.</li>
<li> Anyways, this is not worth the money DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
<li> Waste of cash.</li>
<li> And it doesn&#x27;t destroy your nail bed when you remove it.</li>
<li> It was messy to paint with and took 4 coats to get an even look.</li>
<li> Not sure about the longevity aspect yet, however I wanted to comment on the application of the Wine Stock itself.</li>
<li> Lasts at least two weeks as a PEDICURE but chipped off after four days on my fingers.  </li>
<li> 2nd time I used the polish, it was streaky, thick (like an old bottle of polish) and the end results were bubbly, streaky and it just looked terrible.</li>
<li> Did my hands this morning, have done NO house work, and they already look dull, DULL, DULL!  </li>
<li> I get a chip, usually a very small one, at the 10 day mark</li>
<li> I&#x27;m annoyed I purchased 2 colors.</li>
<li> but by then I&#x27;m tired of the color and my cuticles need a manicure anyway.  </li>
<li> To bad, because I like their other product lines.</li>
<li> difficult to remove and too liquidy</li>
<li> Unfortunately, even after 2 coats its a tad bit translucent in parts.</li>
<li> I am so disappointed in this polish.</li>
<li> I followed directions and did not use a base coat, and wonder whether that would have made a difference.</li>

    <li> Did not even come close to Gel Nail Polish</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with this &amp;#34;miracle gel&amp;#34; the only miracle that I see is me buying this 7.99 nail polish and I didn&#x27;t even realize that it had a second step wich is the top coat, I guess that&#x27;s my mistake but I bought it at Kroger and there was no advise that I needed to buy a second one.. Anyways, this is not worth the money DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Just purchased and applied this color and the no light gel top coat for the first time. Not sure about the longevity aspect yet, however I wanted to comment on the application of the Wine Stock itself. The color is very pretty, dark and rich. However the polish was a little thicker then normal. It&#x27;s also streaky. As a nail tech I always wonder how things will work when no base coat is required or recommended. I really feel like there would be a more even polish application if the nail was primed with a base coat. I won&#x27;t be taking it off due to the streaking, but it doesn&#x27;t offer a real professional look. I&#x27;m interested to see if the product stays on as long as it&#x27;s claims.</li>
    <li> I love the shade. Unfortunately, even after 2 coats its a tad bit translucent in parts. I tried a blue color first and the same results happened so, this is not a brand I I would recommend. To bad, because I like their other product lines.</li>
    <li> I wanted it to work.  I gave it two tries, but it only lasted about 12 hours longer than a normal nail polish.</li>
    <li> I had to do multiple coats of the color, and then after I applied the top coat, it smudged (not chipped) after a 5 hours of it &#x27;drying&#x27;.</li>
    <li> difficult to remove and too liquidy</li>
    <li> So, Miracle Gel is amazing. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, a gel manicure from a professional is ideal, but expensive. And taking off gel polish is a nightmare! With this stuff, it lasts a solid week and it&#x27;s easy to change colors. No, it doesn&#x27;t last two weeks, but it does last one. And it doesn&#x27;t destroy your nail bed when you remove it. Just make sure to use the special top coast! I&#x27;m going to use this stuff for a while.</li>
    <li> I like the polish... but it did turn out darker than I thought.</li>
    <li> I had really High hopes for this since It cost 10 dollars for the color and 10 dollars for the topcoat. After 3 days it started chipping. I did as the directions followed and I seriously thought that the higher the cost thhe better quality. I took the nail polish back and got my 22 bucks back.</li>
    <li> This product did not last for me.  I did my nails Sunday evening and by Thursday morning one nail was completely peeled off and the other 9 are all chipped. I do not recommend the product and will not use it again. I just wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> Definitely works better than regular polish but not sure if thats attributed to the top coat or a combination of the two.  Lasts at least two weeks as a PEDICURE but chipped off after four days on my fingers.  Still better than regular polish.  I would give it 3 stars for manicure and 5 for pedicure.</li>
    <li> This color is reminiscent of Chanel&#x27;s Vamp.  A deep burgundy with very little purple.  It&#x27;s quite pretty and perfect for fall.  I rarely wear dark polishes on my nails (I save them for my toes) because I inevitably will get chips, which are really noticeable with dark colors.  But Miracle Gel simply doesn&#x27;t chip for at least 10 days.  It&#x27;s the greatest nail invention ever.  And it comes off with regular remover, no soaking or filing necessary.  I have three other colors, all of which are neutrals, so I decided to go for it and try a dark one.  I get a chip, usually a very small one, at the 10 day mark but by then I&#x27;m tired of the color and my cuticles need a manicure anyway.  I&#x27;m sure I could go the full two weeks if I were more patient.  I do use the Miracle Gel top coat every few days because the shine dulls, but other than that, I don&#x27;t baby my manicure.  Miracle Gel delivers what it promises.  In the drugstore, the polishes sell for anywhere between $8 and $10, much less than on Amazon. There are kits with colors not sold separately that come with the top coat and sell for about $16.  The only issue I see is that the color range is limited, which I&amp;#34;m sure the company will rectify as the product gains in popularity.  I definitely recommend this color and Miracle Gel in particular.  It&#x27;s worked for me beautifully.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in this polish. It was messy to paint with and took 4 coats to get an even look. Can&#x27;t say how long it last yet. Will update but based on applying it, I wouldn&#x27;t use it again. I&#x27;ve noticed different colors of gel polish aren&#x27;t all created equal so may try this brand again in different color but had better application with Revlon.</li>
    <li> The first time I used the polish it went on mostly smooth and the end result looked good- the Polish did stay a full 14 days with only the slightest wear- though not a high shine like the salon.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd time I used the polish, it was streaky, thick (like an old bottle of polish) and the end results were bubbly, streaky and it just looked terrible. Definitely not salon quality. Not very glossy and shiny. I used to do nails, so I am extremely particular with how my nails look. This polish is not everything it claims to be. It does not replace a gel polish manicure from the salon.. But it may be ideal to buy you more time when you just can&#x27;t get to the salon.</li>
    <li> This is more so a review of the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel line as opposed to a specific color. I like it more than Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay Gel Envy because it has yet to bubble when I apply it and it lasts longer. It just isn&#x27;t as shiny nor as cheap as Revlon (only $5.00).</li>
    <li> 24 hours of wearing the nail polish and it&#x27;s already chipped in several nails. One nail the polish completely came off. So it doesn&#x27;t last nearly 14 days</li>
    <li> I have the SHMG in a reddish pink color, and it did last a lot longer than regular polish.  However,when I removed it, I noticed that the polish had stained my nails.  I followed directions and did not use a base coat, and wonder whether that would have made a difference.</li>
    <li> Chipped after 12 hours. Waste of cash.</li>
    <li> I bought several colors but have only tried the 470 Red Eye so far (BTW, not real impressed with the selection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not any better than regular polish in my opinion.  I painted my toes late last night, wore open toed shoes today, and the big toe already shows wear this afternoon.  Did my hands this morning, have done NO house work, and they already look dull, DULL, DULL!  Two coats did not give good coverage either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed and actually regret buying 4 different colors before trying it out :-(</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find a reprieve from the $40 gel nail salon bill. This isn&#x27;t it. It lasted 2 days on me and my 26 yr old daughter. I&#x27;m annoyed I purchased 2 colors. The product goes on smoothly and it looks nice; until it chips after 2 days.</li>
