      <li>If you want a zinc oxide-based sunscreen that smells nice and feels nice on, I recommend the Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF 30+, with hyaluronic acid.</li>

      <li>Glad to find it at this company.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t get more than SPF 30 in Australia.</li>
      <li>It sure did the job.</li>
      <li>I love this sunblock.</li>
      <li>everyones skin is different but zinc is great for acne probe skin!</li>
      <li>and I feel confident with this protecting me from the sun-</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen</li>
      <li>Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are safe.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff because&lt;</li>
      <li>It is actually more for the buck as well.</li>
      <li>I bought this sunscreen for my husband who can&#x27;t use chemical sunscreen, which most are.  </li>
      <li>but it was ok on my arms and legs.</li>
      <li>Pretty good stuff.</li>
      <li>And pretty good with water</li>
      <li>Works great, but not at all clear...looks a little like clown make-up, but it does provide great protection.</li>
      <li>Great stuff for sensitive skins!  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your face feel or look greasy--which most facial sunblocks seem to do--and it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
      <li>Reapplied every 60-90 min in the water, and we never got burned, just lightly tanned.</li>
      <li>Such a great product for acne prone skin..</li>
      <li>gave to my friends in tureky on a visit they liked so much they took home now that says alot</li>
      <li>Most importantly, my freckles DO NOT get darker wearing this unlike normal sunblock.</li>
      <li>I only apply in the morning and I am good to go.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not impossible to find for sale</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m nearly freckle free again :)</li>
      <li>I was expecting zinc to provide a total block, better than the chemical sunblocks (most of them).  </li>
      <li>This stuff works great and definitely goes on clear!</li>
      <li>I primarily wanted it for my nose, which always gets too much sun, to keep the redness in check.  </li>
      <li>I used to buy a product that cost 3x or 4x as much, Z-Silk, which is no longer available.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny to avoid sun damage if you are spending hrs in the sun.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several years and it really works for fair skin.</li>
      <li>but the protection is worth it.</li>
      <li>According to the EWG, the top six safest sunscreens are by Alba Botanica, Aubrey, Badger, Kiss My Face, Nature&#x27;s Gate, and Coppertone Sensitive Skin.</li>
      <li>my skin is perfectly clear, better than it has been in years.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;this is the only lotion that is effectively waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is good for sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s too thick to easily use it for your whole body - practically speaking, it&#x27;s probably better for your face.  </li>
      <li>but it very much stings the eyes and therefore don&#x27;t use it on my face.</li>
      <li>It works pretty well.</li>
      <li>It was much better than regular zinc sunblock.</li>
      <li>I found that it worked pretty well and gave my skin the protection that it needed.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because it had a much higher SPF rating that another brand</li>
      <li>Spray is easier but less effective IMHO and cannot take it on plane iirc.</li>
      <li>Clear Zinc wasn&#x27;t cheap but you get more for less compared to what a dermatologist</li>
      <li>This works well enough and feel fine</li>
      <li>It may be that my bottle is a rare defective, and I certainly hope so, since when I squeeze the tube the cream oozes out from the bottom -- as well as the top -- of the lid.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
      <li>My wife wants some now.</li>
      <li>This sun block works for our whole family.</li>
      <li>For the whole body I will look for something easier to apply.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I wore it all summer while in Greece, and the intense Mediterranean sun never burned me.</li>
      <li>My face takes a real beating in the sun.</li>
      <li>This zinc product really \\&quot;blocks\\&quot; the sun without being greasy.</li>
      <li>Really protects against sunburn and does not sweat off.</li>
      <li>goes on like diaper cream no matter how much I shook &amp; massaged tube to blend.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, many of the high SPF suntan lotions irritate my skin, make it red and sting, this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>If you are super fair this really works and disappears so you don&#x27;t look weird.</li>
      <li>But be aware that if you&#x27;re looking for a healthy sunscreen, the main active ingredient in Solar Sense&#x27;s Clear Zinc is Benzophenone 3.</li>
      <li>This goes on white but quickly disappears.</li>
      <li>Would recommend Ocean Portion over this particular product.</li>
      <li>I bought the zinc sunscreen because it is highly recommended for anyone who has laser treatments for hair removal.  </li>
      <li>My expectations may have been too high.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend and will be purchasing again.</li>
      <li>I saw on tv that the zinc topical sunscreens do not have to be reapplied as often as the chemical ones, because they don&#x27;t get absorbed.  </li>
      <li>I still wouldn&#x27;t push my luck and sunbath in the middle of the day, but I have done pretty much whatever I want without burning.</li>
      <li>My other children used our normal sunscreen and were fine.</li>
      <li>and I use it especially for them every day, as Zinc products are the best to slow deterioration of ink due to sun exposure.</li>
      <li>and I live in Florida.</li>
      <li>It was white when applied, but went clear as it absorbed.</li>
      <li>Our son has very sensitive skin and hen</li>
      <li>I work outside in the hot South Florida sun, and after sweating, rain, and six hours of sun</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was unable to use CLEAR ZINC SPFA.I have  problems with it breaking out my body.The only thing that I have ever purchased from Amazon that did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Just get it.  If you golf allot, this will keep you from a doctor&#x27;s appointment for a sun related skin condition.</li>
    <li> My son is a red head and has very sensitive skin. Have used this for a couple years. Glad to find it at this company. It came fast and new as expected. This is a good product and I have tried many</li>
    <li> I was told about this product by a coworker. He loves it. He stated it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;life guard&amp;#34; look. I expected that it would be clear immediately upon application, this was not the fact. It was white when applied, but went clear as it absorbed. I just rubbed it in until it went clear. It was much better than regular zinc sunblock. Zinc sunblock is all I buy, so this product is perfect. I don&#x27;t run around with a pastey white face. It DOES take a little rubbing in though, so do not be surprised or alarmed.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with SPF 70!  I bought the zinc sunscreen because it is highly recommended for anyone who has laser treatments for hair removal.  Sunscreen with zinc isn&#x27;t on every drug store shelf, so it was easy to find on Amazon!  It&#x27;s not impossible to find for sale and I actually could have bought it for a little less locally, but I wasn&#x27;t sure and I needed to get some.  The laser salon sells some for 5 times the Amazon price.  I would recommend whether you have laser treatments or not.</li>
    <li> goes on like diaper cream no matter how much I shook &amp; massaged tube to blend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it had a much higher SPF rating that another brand and it promised to go on clear.  It never went on clear.  It was thick and white and never rubbed in to clear.  I thought that it may have separated somehow in storage so I mixed it around in the tube and still, never rubbed in clear, white as if I had some white paint on.  So, since I had used some of it I decided that it wasn&#x27;t worth returning, I squeezed it all out of the tube into an empty container and mixed thoroughly.... Nope.  Same result.  Would never rub in clear, no matter what.  It probably is SPF 70 and it seems to be zinc-oxide because I used the non-clear type for years.  Not sure what was wrong with this brand.  Would recommend Ocean Portion over this particular product.</li>
    <li> Does NOT go on clear. Doesn&#x27;t even rub in at all. I gave it two stars because we didn&#x27;t get sunburned, but we won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
    <li> After wasting a lot of money on sunscreens that promise to be gentle on sensitive skin I have finally found a product that works.  Most sunscreens give me a rash on my face that is worse than sunburn.  After using this product for the last 4 months in Hawaii my skin is perfectly clear, better than it has been in years.  I put the clear zinc on after washing and letting my skin dry for a few minutes.  I am using this product instead of moisturizing cream day &amp; night.  Great results!</li>
    <li> I asked my Dermatologist why I still am getting brown spots on my face - even though I used a SPF 70 regular Sunscreen.  He said that the only sunscreen to prevent brown spots would be zinc.  He suggested I look for a clear or colored zinc sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a long search at stores and online and reading reviews on other products, I found Solar Sense Clear Zinc SPF 705. (Even Walmart didn&#x27;t have a zinc sunscreen.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!  I&#x27;ve had it for a month and  don&#x27;t go out that often so not sure yet if it is actually works to keep my brown spots on my face from getting worse. But I hope so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  It actually doesn&#x27;t go on Clear at first as it&#x27;s still white.  but I rub it in a little and it turns clear.  I do put a second cote over my brown spots and pat until it doesn&#x27;t look so white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note:  I read the review on some of the flesh colored products and they weren&#x27;t good - so this is the only one I found that seems great.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home, if I go outside to garden, I just put a lot on and leave it white - want as much protection as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a sort of heavy waterproof type coating where you use it, and with water and a washcloth as it&#x27;s not good to leave sunscreen on at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep buying it!</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen it is one of the few that does not cause my face to break out, so I always keep some with me when I travel so I don&#x27;t get sunburned.  Really protects against sunburn and does not sweat off.</li>
    <li> Had excema problem from tanning creams. this cream is working out well. Goes on soft and non greasy. feels like you are using nothing.</li>
    <li> worse than zinc oxide</li>
    <li> This goes on white but quickly disappears. It doesn&#x27;t bug my skin a bit and actually seems to help. Recommended.</li>
    <li> It separates in a hot car, it goes on thick (before it separates and turns to water) and takes a long time to rub in.</li>
    <li> Great Zinc based sunblock. Worth every penny to avoid sun damage if you are spending hrs in the sun. Fab!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my face and I don&#x27;t burn. Lasts a long time too. I don&#x27;t have to reapply. I only apply in the morning and I am good to go.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful!  I have had some serious skin cancer issues, so it is paramount I get maximum coverage.  The Clear Zinc comes out white, but all you have to do is rub it in for about 30 seconds or less, and it disappears.  I apply it on my face over my moisturizer, and under any makeup I plan to wear.  I spend time on the coast and in the mountains, and it gives me great protection in both situations.  I use this DAILY!  I have sensitive skin and I do not experience any break out problems or clogged pours.  This is a life saver product for me!</li>
    <li> I use it for my nose, neck and ears when cycling and it worked well this summer. It did not come off when exercising vigorously. My wife wants some now.</li>
    <li> This is NOT clear....</li>
    <li> great product to start the day with before leaving for activities.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and it really works for fair skin.</li>
    <li> ingreediance and price made this my choice.  Know your own concerns of sunburm requirements.  Make your day the best for you..  .</li>
    <li> I put this sunscreen on my daughter before a day of skiing and she came back completely burnt. My other children used our normal sunscreen and were fine. I am furious that I trusted this product.</li>
    <li> I started getting dark spots on my face (common with olive skin) and this product has completely blocked out any new damage and has allowed my skin to heal and the spots to completely disappear!!  I use this when I know I&#x27;m going to be out for an extended period of time.  It&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
    <li> Very thick which i guess is the point</li>
    <li> We all got sunburned when using this product. Applied it liberally as usual with sunscreens. Went on easily, not chalky.</li>
    <li> Thick, doesn&#x27;t rub in and soak in well. Leaves the skin very white and chalky. I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Its a very good product just i would like if could have more spf like 100 , will be perfect</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff. My face takes a real beating in the sun. I get lots of brown spots even thru the car window! It works pretty well. Used it on my baby grandson&#x27;s feet when we were at the Miami Zoo. Worked great. His little feet never even got pink and no side effects even tho he was in the stroller for hours.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to regular sunscreen, it causes a horrible burning sensation and redness to my skin, so I was very glad to find Solar Sense. I have several large tattoos and I use it especially for them every day, as Zinc products are the best to slow deterioration of ink due to sun exposure. It does have a slight white tint to it, but I don&#x27;t mind that, it&#x27;s not bad enough to make me not wear it.</li>
    <li> If you look at me I sunburn, but not with this stuff. I still wouldn&#x27;t push my luck and sunbath in the middle of the day, but I have done pretty much whatever I want without burning. If you are super fair this really works and disappears so you don&#x27;t look weird.</li>
    <li> gave to my friends in tureky on a visit they liked so much they took home now that says alot</li>
    <li> Well... I am not sure anymore if the zinc sunblock is actually less harming than the regular sunblock ( did some research), But I still need to protect my skin from the sun since it is extremely sensitive. The consistency is horrible, and it takes you a while to even it out until your skin doesn&#x27;t have any white spots of sunscreen. I don&#x60;t use it that much anymore, because of how hard it is to apply, but I still give 4 stars cause I guess it does its job, you can use it for face and body,  and it doesn&#x27;t  leave any smell as other sunblocks.</li>
    <li> works. a little greasy but super for ears</li>
    <li> This seems to work, but I can not say it works better than other products which are less expensive</li>
    <li> This is tends to be on the dry side and takes a bit of time to rub it in until the white cream disappears.  For the whole body I will look for something easier to apply.  For the face though, this is great. Not too greasy.</li>
    <li> It may be a good sunscreen but it very much stings the eyes and therefore don&#x27;t use it on my face.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for sensitive skins!  And pretty good with water...difficult to find in stores so Amazon is the spot for us!</li>
    <li> This does protect your skin but its thick and feels oily.  Can&#x27;t wait to wash it off when I am back inside.  Gonna try something else.</li>
    <li> I love this sunblock. Is a great sun protection and not cause pimples or any thing else. In de begining looks white, but if you keep rubbing it will deseapere un seconds,</li>
    <li> very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen for avoiding sunburned nose in Florida for fair-skinned person. I have sensitive skin, many of the high SPF suntan lotions irritate my skin, make it red and sting, this doesn&#x27;t. When you first put it on you see a white film, but it goes away in a few seconds.</li>
    <li> Works great, but not at all clear...looks a little like clown make-up, but it does provide great protection.</li>
    <li> Great product! It doesn&#x27;t make your face feel or look greasy--which most facial sunblocks seem to do--and it&#x27;s very effective. I wore it all summer while in Greece, and the intense Mediterranean sun never burned me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a northern European living in Florida, so I could catch a sunburn sitting indoors. This stuff works great and definitely goes on clear!</li>
    <li> I spent 10 days in Ecuador and the Galapagos and did not burn at all. Used this on face, arms, legs. If anything, it worked too well. I can&#x27;t even tell I was in the sun.</li>
    <li> The long subject line of my review pretty much says it all.  Clear Zinc wasn&#x27;t cheap but you get more for less compared to what a dermatologist charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product on my face and a less expensive Target brand kids suncreen elsewhere.  This zinc product really \\&quot;blocks\\&quot; the sun without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores- I have acne prone skin and I feel confident with this protecting me from the sun- and I live in Florida.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially when it comes to sunscreen.  This product worked amazingly well.  Used it during a trip to Palm Springs during 110 + weather while in the pool.  I had no skin issues at all from using it.  I highly recommend and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> As a couple of &#x27;shark-bait whiteskins&#x27; going to Maui for a couple weeks, wanted something that would work well. It sure did the job. Reapplied every 60-90 min in the water, and we never got burned, just lightly tanned. It is thick and difficult to apply smoothly, have to really rub it in. Spray is easier but less effective IMHO and cannot take it on plane iirc.</li>
    <li> The price of this was 10 x what I would have spent on zinc oxide.  Lots of work not to look like the invisible man with sunglasses.  Just buy zinc oxide for nose ears, etc.  Save your money on this one.</li>
    <li> Such a great product for acne prone skin.. I used it for a couple days and not only does it protect you from the sun but it actually helped me clear up from my skin.. everyones skin is different but zinc is great for acne probe skin!</li>
    <li> Protected my skin from the sun, but my skin and my two sisters skin all broke out and became irritated after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Would not reorder.</li>
    <li> I found that it worked pretty well and gave my skin the protection that it needed.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get more than SPF 30 in Australia. I love this stuff because&lt;br /&gt;1. I don&#x27;t get burnt&lt;br /&gt;2. It works in the harshest conditions&lt;br /&gt;3. Most importantly, my freckles DO NOT get darker wearing this unlike normal sunblock. I&#x27;m nearly freckle free again :)</li>
    <li> I work outside in the hot South Florida sun, and after sweating, rain, and six hours of sun I didn&#x27;t get burned. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are safe. But be aware that if you&#x27;re looking for a healthy sunscreen, the main active ingredient in Solar Sense&#x27;s Clear Zinc is Benzophenone 3. This is just another name for oxybenzone. According to the EWG, the top six safest sunscreens are by Alba Botanica, Aubrey, Badger, Kiss My Face, Nature&#x27;s Gate, and Coppertone Sensitive Skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen for my husband who can&#x27;t use chemical sunscreen, which most are.  They give him an itchy rash.  This does go on clear if you rub it it.  I saw on tv that the zinc topical sunscreens do not have to be reapplied as often as the chemical ones, because they don&#x27;t get absorbed.  It does not give him a rash.  It&#x27;s a physical rather than a chemical sunscreen.</li>
    <li> ...as we put this on their faces in the pool.  Other sunscreens haven&#x27;t worked as well or get in their eyes and sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again!  We&#x27;ve had no sunburns to speak of after using this.</li>
    <li> bought this stuff online and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  not a very good product.  need to reapply every 30 minutes just to get it to work... at that rate I would go through a bottle a day!!!</li>
    <li> As I spend a lot of time out of doors, I need an effective sunblock without scent, which attracts stinging insects.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have had melanoma and I surf in Central America,&lt;br /&gt;this is the only lotion that is effectively waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;I surfed in 90 degree sun twice a day and never got&lt;br /&gt;a sunburn!</li>
    <li> This works well enough and feel fine but it is very hard to rub into the skin and I don&#x27;t care for the smell. It doesn&#x27;t seem to protect as well as others either.</li>
    <li> I used this on my face and it did not dry as thin or clear as I thought it would. I did not like it under foundation but it was ok on my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> I used to buy a product that cost 3x or 4x as much, Z-Silk, which is no longer available. Zinc is good for my skin. It is a good sunscreen. You do have to rub this stuff into your skin, though. It is heavy. But you only need a very small amount of it.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t be buying this one again. I can only wear this low on my body as I can&#x27;t stand the aroma. Also, it&#x27;s not an easy spreader, especially for the face, and I felt too thickly coated on my face, never mind the smell. It may be that my bottle is a rare defective, and I certainly hope so, since when I squeeze the tube the cream oozes out from the bottom -- as well as the top -- of the lid. Messy. If you want a zinc oxide-based sunscreen that smells nice and feels nice on, I recommend the Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF 30+, with hyaluronic acid. If you need a higher SPF, I recommend Neutrogena creams and especially its Ultra Sheer Liquid Sunscreen (SPF 70).</li>
    <li> I have used a different brand of zinc, but this is far better than the other brand and goes a long way. This tube is larger and easier to use than the other brand I had tried. It is actually more for the buck as well.</li>
    <li> Our son has very sensitive skin and hen we go on vacation he always gets his cheeks burnt. This year we asked our doctor and he recommended zinc. You product not only kept him from getting burnt but it also allowed him to swim in the gulf water without pain. Because of your product and out doctor we had the most wonderful family vacation ever. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great sun protection. You won&#x27;t get burnt wearing this stuff. I can wear it on my face daily. It is thick so you have to rub it in well but the protection is worth it.</li>
    <li> very hard to spread.....</li>
    <li> This sun block works for our whole family.</li>
    <li> My expectations may have been too high.  I was expecting zinc to provide a total block, better than the chemical sunblocks (most of them).  This one is labeled \\&quot;clear zinc\\&quot;, but initially it is white - it&#x27;s very thick and concentrated, and you use very little.  When you rub it in, the whiteness gradually disappears.  I primarily wanted it for my nose, which always gets too much sun, to keep the redness in check.  It definitely keeps me from burning, but it doesn&#x27;t totally keep my nose from getting red.  I&#x27;m not convinced that it works better than the other high-end sun lotions that I&#x27;ve used, which were chemical blocks, not physical blocks such as this.  It is good for sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s too thick to easily use it for your whole body - practically speaking, it&#x27;s probably better for your face.  It&#x27;s good to have in your sun-arsenal, but don&#x27;t throw out the rest.</li>
