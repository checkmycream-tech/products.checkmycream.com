      <li>I love this body butter.</li>

    <li> wife loves it enough said</li>
    <li> These Avani products are great. It is top quality at a good price.   they were delivered promptly &amp; made terrific gifts. They smell great and  are very smooth to the touch.</li>
    <li> So wonderfully moisturizing without feeling greasy, smells and feels great! Wish I could add this product to my subscriptions. Never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I love this body butter. It penetrates in my skin without leaving an oily look. I use it on my dry heels and elbows. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was doubtful when purchasing this Body Butter. I have tried so many with no luck. Until now. When I first stuck two fingers in the this butter I thought, &amp;#34;too thin&amp;#34;.  As I began rubbing it in I thought,&amp;#34;oh no, it&#x27;s sticky like others. It&#x27;s of no use to me. More wasted money.&amp;#34; When I finished applying the Creamy Butter I went about my doings. Two minutes later I noticed it was not sticky and my hands looked moisturizer. Mind you, I have to use more than with thicker butter so this is a bit more costly in the end. But it works. I will likely buy more before the price doubles.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this cream along with the salt scrub to reduce the scaliness of psoriasis. They worked!  This is a very thick cream and a little goes a long way. Wonderful, light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, great texture, makes your skin like honey:-) i loved it and tried other flavours, avani products are great.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is wonderful.  Feels lovely and absorbs perfectly.  Probably the best lotion I’ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Great Body Butter:-0  This is so thick and moisturizing --better than the high dollar body Creams and Butter&#x27;s.  I love the soft, light fragrance too.  This is my discovery of the month.  Great price--I simply love it:-0</li>
    <li> great product, delivery just as promised.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the richest, best smelling, most moisturizing body butter I have ever used! I can&#x27;t believe it doesn&#x27;t cost three times as much as it does. The smell is amazing too and not overpowering at all. If you&#x27;re on the fence, buy. It. Now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always glad to find this product at a reasonable price.  It&#x27;s never cheap but Amazon usually has the best price around.  I use this product on those &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; dry places &amp; spots.  It smells good too!</li>
    <li> AVANI Citrus &amp; Vanilla Body Butter, 9.35 fl. oz.  Excellent. Avani is some of the best anywhere. Highly recommend the entire line of products.</li>
    <li> I come from a warm and humid country where we do not need to apply moisturizers every day. Since its cool and dry where i live now, my skin was badly dehydrated and breakouts started all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using LUSH body butters for a while and I love the way it penetrates my skin layers and doesn&#x27;t have any greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;I like keeping my skin well moisturized by using AVANI body Scrub (Green Tea). Love the way my skin feels after. Super soft, its ridiculous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, assuming that AVANI brand has a good line of products, I tried their body butter.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this body butter leaves me with a waxy skin surface, like a layer of candle. It doesn&#x27;t penetrate my skin layer and leaves stain on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Not a huge fan of the smell either. Doesn&#x27;t smell as fresh as I would&#x27;ve expect.</li>
    <li> This body butter keeps me smooth and moisturized without all the grease.  It smells good too!  Try it with the Avani salt scrub and it will cure even the driest skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service, and a lovely product. I would definitely order this product again.    The body butter has a wonderful scent, and isn&#x27;t overpowering. It does not have an oily feel, and obsorbes quickly into the skin.</li>
    <li> Pretty good and to be honest, I stink at the regimin so it might get 5 stars if I would just make it a point to use it every day.  Smells very nice.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! Its the only thing that works on my dry skin in the cold winter months and has a fresh (non chemically) scent. Doesn&#x27;t feel super greasy like other heavy moisturizing creams/body butters either.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great product and item deliverd on-time.</li>
    <li> The Avani body butter is very rich and creamy and I just love the fragrances.  One jar lasts a long time because it is so smooth.  This butter is good if you like a richer cream and but probably not as good if you don&#x27;t like something as oily.  I use it in the winter and summer to prevent dry skin and retain moisture.  The fragrances are light and add to the experience.</li>
