<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing for my skin. For me, it is comparable to the prescription cream I had.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer. It feels like I&#x27;ve tried 100&#x27;s of products but always vine back to this. It does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very good at reducing signs of wrinkles and evening out skin tone. I have used the more expensive brands and they are no better than neutrogena they just cost more.</li>
    <li> I helped my friends buy it. But I used it one year ago, it is a good product. It did not break me out. Anyway, it is good.</li>
    <li> This is pleasant and does a lovely job. I&#x27;ve used it for a long time and was pleased to find it on Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Within 1 week face is much smoother &amp; softer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m updating this review: I had to go to the ER. My face was swollen like CRAZY, I looked like a completely different person and couldn&#x27;t put in my contacts or fit my glasses on my face (after lots of medication the swelling and bumpiness went down after about four days). When I explained what cream I was using they all nodded their heads in understanding, \\&quot;Yes, that happens a lot with retinal.\\&quot; What the label did not emphasize is how little one is supposed to use and then build up to a larger amount (a small \\&quot;pea\\&quot; size amount is not enough to cover my face). If you have sensitive skin, I advise to stay away from this. If you want to use it anyway, build up your tolerance one day at a time. I think the label should be changed.</li>
    <li> I know that dermatologist perscribe a mix of retinoids to treat acne, so tried this one without an RX, and it works great</li>
    <li> I have used the DAY version of this product for years and absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thought the NIGHT version would be great.  Unfortunately, the Night version is&lt;br /&gt;much heavier and i feel it clogs my pores.  The day version is so light and goes on so smoothly&lt;br /&gt;and this night version is just too heavy for me.</li>
    <li> Best pricing found on this site.</li>
    <li> I am going on 40 this year and try to keep my skin looking young and healthy. Prevention is the key I think. I do have some redness from sun damage over the years ( I am very fair).&lt;br /&gt;This product is very creamy and light. It smooths on very nicely and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;I am prone to breakouts when something is heavy and I never have a problem with this. Also no irritating oders.&lt;br /&gt;I feel I have noticed a slight improvement in my skin&#x27;s tone and the size of my pores after 2 months of using. My skin is definatly softer. I do not have any fine lines but I do have some pretty deep smile lines and a frown line between my eyebrows which I have also notice a slight improvement.Although I do wish for more. But so far nothing has turned out to be a miracle cream for that issue yet. All in all a nice product that goes on well without irritation and has shown me some results. I will continue to use this in my skin care.</li>
    <li> The tube runs out pretty quickly. Results aren&#x27;t too noticeable for me (I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s). The scent is nice and isn&#x27;t too strong. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily, and I&#x27;ve gotten a few comments on how my skin is clear from a few people since I&#x27;ve started using it, so I think I&#x27;ll keep up with using it though, for prevention. If another product comes around at a better price, I&#x27;d probably switch.</li>
    <li> I just found out they test on animals, my money (vote to promote this) is not going to that! I now quickly Google any product, why should they do this if it&#x27;s \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; supposedly? We don&#x27;t live in the stone ages, it is so barbaric and wrong!</li>
    <li> One of the least expensive anti wrinkle creams that actually work</li>
    <li> It works really well, I&#x27;m still on the search for the perfect face lotion, though.</li>
    <li> This leaves my face feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Do your research, know yourself and your needs.  I have used this one for a few years and I like it.  My wife and I both use it.  This is affordable and works well overall.  We both don&#x27;t have overly oily or dry skin so we&#x27;re able to use a myriad of products with success.  This has retinol in it, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to that you might want to look elsewhere.  My view on facial products is that you shouldn&#x27;t expect a miracle or huge change - that&#x27;s totally unrealistic.  But you should expect something that seems to help a bit with aging and moisture - this one does that for both of us.  We&#x27;ll likely keep use this one for a while.</li>
    <li> Been using Neutrogena Healthy Skin for years - even before I needed it for Wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Better than department store creams.</li>
    <li> Being a Fifty-Nine year old male and a little vain.  I am seeing a murder of Crows feet around my eyes. Thought I should act before I  am covered in Crow  Sh-t..  Got the  Neutrogena  Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream close to a month ago.  Used it  at least five nights a week. One side of my face is twice as bad as the other, Maybe due to driving for work.  I am seeing a difference on one side.  Am I wrinkle free?  NO.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever be.  But I will continue to use.  Everyone could use a little hope in a tube.</li>
    <li> helps fade dark spots</li>
    <li> I have only been using this cream for about a week, but honestly saw an improvement in my skin in  just a few days. My face looks and feels softer and smoother.... I was worried about using a retinol because I have dry, sensitive skin, but this stuff is fabulous! Can&#x27;t wait to see the long-term results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  I love and trust Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> This is the cream that performs as promised. It does deliver some noticeable impact in making the skin look younger and does make the skin feel smoother. It goes on easy and quickly works its way into the skin without the greasy residue. You can apply and go out without the shiny look. It also does not get that sheen on the face when you sweat. The more expensive creams can definitely take a lesson from Neutrogena with this product. It is on my standard list of repurchases from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing night cream. I wanted to try a mild retinol product to see how it affected my acne prone skin and I am happy to say that there are only two products in the world that do not make me break out after using it and this is one of them. I noticed my skin was much smoother after just the first application and only improved afterwards. No tingling or burning as with other retinol products and I even applied it around my eyes without any negative reactions. There wasn&#x27;t any significant improvement with the fine wrinkles that I have on my forehead due to sun exposure but it is still a wonderful night cream. Overall, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I get mild eczema when I use other moisturizers, but this one keeps the eczema at bay.  My MD recommended it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly all of the major anti-aging creams out there. I&#x27;ve tried all the big drugstore brands (olay, Roc, etc), I&#x27;ve tried department store brands (clinique, origins, etc), and I keep coming back to this one every time. I love that it does not have a fragrance (the overpowering scent of perfume is what turned me off from Roc). I love that it&#x27;s not greasy, but yet it gives me just the right amount of moisture before bed. Most of all, I love that this 30-something girl still gets carded regularly when I buy a bottle of wine at the grocery store. Really, what more can a girl ask for from a wrinkle cream?</li>
    <li> My skin feel great after using</li>
    <li> Works for me great, wrinkles gone</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the SPF 15 of the day cream has.</li>
    <li> I have been using this nightly.  Of course, nothing works miracles, but this seems to work!</li>
    <li> This was a very good wrinkle cream.  I am not out of it yet but when I run out I will probably buy some more.</li>
    <li> After 15 years of trying proactiv, clearasil, clear skin regimen, differin, retin-a, murad, and everything else under the sun, this was the first thing that made my skin look good. No more deep zits or blackheads, no peeling or redness, and the very few pimples I get go away quickly. Not saying it will work for everyone, but at 1/4 the price of the other cures, it&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
    <li> I used the whole tube and could not tell a difference in the eye &amp; mouth fine lines. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for years now and I love it.  I received it in a timely manner and would recommend it for purchase.</li>
    <li> I prefer Neutrogen&#x27;s rapid wrinkle repair, and I loved their anti wrinkle-anti acne lotion, which they discontinued, BOO NEUTROGENA! However, I love most of Neutrogena&#x27;s products, this just didn&#x27;t give me results. I am 30 and I have used anti aging lotion preventatively since age 25,  but I can usually still see results in skin clarity and smoothness,  but this stuff did NOTHING. bring back my anti wrinkle anti acne lotion!</li>
    <li> This is a good skin cream but I really can&#x27;t tell much difference in it and less expensive creams .  I like the fact that it goes on smoothly without &amp;#34;tugging&amp;#34; at my skin.  It does have an SPF of 30, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Only time can tell how good this product is</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream on and off for about two years since I can&#x27;t get it in stores where I live, but honestly this is just so good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;When I use it I wake up feeling like I really had a beauty sleep. Skin looks fresher and less tired than usual just after a couple uses and with time, it does reduce those first lines around the mouth, eyes and around the forehead. I&#x27;ve noticed it makes my skin look clearer, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 yrs old and my face has unfortunately been showing signs of age - dark spots and wrinkles - over the past several years.  Acne also have returned after not having had them since I was a teenager. Anyway, I decided to give this product a try as the reviews were so good, but I had reservations because I&#x27;ve been disappointed with things that have had good reviews in the past (one of them being the Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Tone Correcting Moisture lotion - greasy yucky feeling).     This product was not one of those.  This stuff works.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my face was in such horrible condition that just two nights of use and I could tell the difference in the size of my pores, my skin tone was more even, and my face was smoother and not so bumpy looking.  My acne have also cleared up.  I definitely would continue to use this product as long as it&#x27;s available and continue to do as well as it has.</li>
    <li> I bought the day cream &amp; night cream from another store, as well as the non-alcohol toner. They have worked ok. My skin is smoother, but I have not noticed any uneven marks going away. I don&#x27;t know when that is supposed to happen... I also have been using their alcohol free toner. Then I discovered something very upsetting! Neutrogena does animal testing, along with Olay!! I will not be purchasing these items again. What a dissapointment. Does anyone know of any products that don&#x27;t do animal testing??</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed a skin care product in my life, but this product is so amazing I want to shout it from the rooftops! I am 31 years old. I still occasionally get breakouts and recently I have started seeing some fine lines around my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried more products than I can list and either they did absolutely nothing or made my skin even worse by causing more breakouts, making my skin really oily, or drying it out. So really when I bought this product I didn&#x27;t expect much. However, to my total amazement, after ONE use I could see the lines fading and after three uses some of the lines have DISAPPEARED. I look FIVE YEARS YOUNGER after just a few days of use!! I am using this product along with Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Anti-Blemish Cleanser and I will NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE. My face is smoother, softer, firmer, completely breakout-free, my pores are smaller and clearer and the fine lines have almost totally disappeared! I don&#x27;t know what kind of voodoo they put in those bottles! Try it right now. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Was a bit worried because I&#x27;m only 24, and this stuff is anti-wrinkle. But after using it just twice, my skin is baby soft.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a retinal product that didn&#x27;t have other ingredients that would clog my pores or be too greasy which will make me break out. I can always count on neutrogena to do that. It&#x27;s also not too drying like some retinols can be</li>
    <li> I do like this over the counter wrinkle cream product. I prefer Botox at the doctors office but this cream does help a little</li>
    <li> Works good. A little goes a long way so the tube should last a while. I&#x27;ve noticed a slight improvement in my complexion but nothing too major.</li>
    <li> This really works!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love how soft my skin has felt since I started using this daily.</li>
    <li> i have used products that were plain moisturizers but this one does the trick.  i cant attest to the anti wrinkle aspects because that is kind of hard to judge unless you analyze of a multi-year period, but i feel like my skin is smooth after applying it and waiting 30 minutes.  this product has retinol which has some research on it which is great. overall, great cream for guys and gals</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and truly works -- have used it for years. When I take a few days off from use, my skin lets me know I need to go back on the regimen!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a first time i bought anti wrinkle night cream . I am 50 ,my skin is normal but sensitive and i have not to many wrinkles. Used this  for a week. I am very happy with this product . During the day i am using firming cream ( about 3 tubes finished ) . Both are NOT giving any bad feeling to my skin at all ,no irritation,no burning ,no red spots  . I see my face looks fresh and healthy  . I will stick with this creams for good and will buy anti-wrinkle day cream next time too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this night cream! It feels so silky and buttery smooth. The first time I used it I squirted out way too much- a little goes a long way! It&#x27;s not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and it makes my skin feel fantastic!</li>
    <li> The night cream filled in the lines around my mouth right away which is really surprising since they&#x27;re deep. I&#x27;ve only seen a very minor change on my eye and forehead wrinkles. So, I&#x27;m using this more as a preventative in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not greasy and didn&#x27;t aggravate my acne at all. I&#x27;m not sure after only one week, but I think its actually helping my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it burns if used on the eye area. I do it anyway tho to avoid buying a separate eye cream.</li>
    <li> It is a great product and cheap. I have been using it for 4 months now and the fine line seems less noticeable and skin is smoother.</li>
    <li> Feels &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; compared to previous ntcremes. I like, though. Non greasy</li>
    <li> Light, perfect night cream</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need to use much of this product and it lasts a long time. But haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference yet I  will keep using it though cause I know in time it will help prevent more aging!</li>
    <li> I looooove the night cream. I&#x27;m actually wearing it day and night.vi have the anytime one but the texture if the night one makes my face so much smoother</li>
    <li> Used the whole thing. Couldn&#x27;t tell if it made any difference or not.</li>
    <li> I love it it work great</li>
    <li> Had a bad reaction to this product. Caused swelling in my forehead and eyes even tho I was careful to to put around my eyes.  I believe it would work well tho if your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it.</li>
    <li> it takes some effective, but seems not obvious as expected.</li>
    <li> Soaks in completely without residue.  Makeup goes over it like it isn&#x27;t there.  It has sun protection too.  I think it works, because I&#x27;m mid-sixties, and no crows feet or wrinkles of any kind yet.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena has a good reputation in its field. So, I&#x27;m sorry to say I&#x27;m disappointed by this night cream. It burned and irritated my skin. I can&#x27;t use it and it&#x27;s not worth the trouble to return it. I trusted the Neutrogena name and I&#x27;m sorry. I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years - I am an over 50 male. It keep my skin in great shape for my age. I make sure never to run out of it.</li>
    <li> Great to get my broke-out skin back to normal. But I stopped and switch back to Rosehill oil coz I don&#x27;t like using too much retinol.</li>
    <li> Good product, haven&#x27;t come to realize how much progress it will make! but so good so far!</li>
    <li> It even removed some of my acne scars.  I started using this a few months ago and it was a great decision.</li>
    <li> I have just started using it. But the shipping was fast. Although i had expected it to be alittle bigger. But hope it works. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using this since before I needed it. It doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen, so I can use my own, or just use an umbrella.</li>
    <li> Hmmmm. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while with no obvious change?</li>
    <li> I tried this a few years ago as it was recommended by my Dermatologist. I noticed a decrease in lines, and for me this controls oily areas but does not increase dryness in dry spots. My skin feels smoother.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to find this available since all of my local stores were out.  I have used this for a while with pleasing results.</li>
    <li> This product received a best rating from beatypedia.com.  I like the feel and use during the day too over my sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for about 5 days, however, I can see the difference already! I bought this cream actually because I am 38 and was suffering from acne (I believe possible hormonal imbalance due to me stopping use of birth control pills).  I was using Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free Acne Wash Daily Scrub, and had noticed improvement, however, it was not until I added the Healthy Skim Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream into my daily routine that I was able to see a remarkable difference.  My skin looks healthier, more radiant, smoother, and the redness is going away.  I love this and can&#x27;t wait to see my results in 30 days!</li>
    <li> I have awful skin; big pores, large acne spots, and dark spots from acne scarring...This cream faded these spots already and I&#x27;ve only used it two nights so far. It also has already shrunk my other acne spots. Overall my skin (pores/wrinkles etc.) Looks better already too. I can&#x27;t say my wrinkles are diminished as it has only been two days, but I&#x27;ve never had anything produce results so quickly before, so I am encouraged to think they will be over time. I am definitely going to keep using this! I&#x27;ve heard it lasts quite a while too and I believe it, because it&#x27;s not typical cream, it&#x27;s almost a gel, pretty wet, and you really do only need a pea sized portion to cover your face and neck. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week now. So far so good though! Haven&#x27;t had any burning or reactions. My skin is pretty sensitive so I&#x27;m happy so far.</li>
    <li> This is anice product.  Love that its not too expensive and works wonders.  I like that it is light and does not feel cakey or oily after applying</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple of weeks, and maybe there&#x27;s an improvement!  It&#x27;s a nice consistency and seems to be doing as promised.</li>
    <li> This applies smoothly and feels good on my skin right after application but it ends up making my skin feel oily and greasy. This breaks me out when I use it on my face but I don&#x27;t want to let the tube go to waste so I started using it on my neck. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck because my skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive there.</li>
    <li> Slight irritation when using it, but it goes away. It seems to be a strong cream but feels good. Not greasy. I feel like this is working in combination with the St. Ives timeless moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Blistered my face - i had to go to the dermatologist.  do not use this every day - it will destroy you!!!  I had never used anything with Retin, so i didn&#x27;t know that you need to &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; your tolerance...&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t be trying it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular guy but my face wash was drying out my skin really bad. I needed a night time oil free moisturizer and came across this item and it actually works and my face looks healthier. Just try it, buy it on here if ur embarrassed to get it in the store lol and its at a better price on here anyway.</li>
    <li> Great texture and a steal online. Has the perfect lotion texture to be used as a layering product or as you stand alone moisturizer. I&#x27;m oily skin though, so if you have dry skin I&#x27;m sure this could work for you too but add a little more or something thicker over it. It really is a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve also used this item for at least 2 or 3 years and i get lots of compliments on how well ,my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for the past 10 years! Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
    <li> I have a myraid of products and interestingly enough some of the cheapest ones are the best.  This is now my only night-cream.  If I haven&#x27;t used it for a while I notice more uneven skin and maybe blemishes.  I&#x27;ll put it on at night and have noticeably smoother skin the next morning. I&#x27;ve tried tons of other expensive night-creams and this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Great product.  People notice the difference in my face!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, but my skin did start to look better after using it for a few weeks. It&#x27;s a nice and light lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed! I can see a difference in one week.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a night cream that isn&#x27;t unpleasantly thick and feels heavy on your face. I took a chance on this Neutrogena cream and I like it. I can&#x27;t say whether it does anything for wrinkles (Photoshop is the best solution I&#x27;ve found!) but it goes on light and isn&#x27;t sticky. I like the simple tube -- no pumping or twisting or any of the other frustrating packaging quirks of some products.</li>
    <li> After carefully considering all the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try.  I don&#x27;t hate it, but it has not really removed or lightened any wrinkles.  Considering my wrinkles can only be considered light, I thought I&#x27;d have good results at making them even lighter.  I also have some spotting due to the sun, and again, no lightening of those.  I am disappointed.  I don&#x27;t dislike this lotion, it&#x27;s not heavy, it goes on nicely and it has no smell....all good things, but anti-wrinkle is not an adjective that this girl can use for this cream.  My search will continue.</li>
    <li> This anti-wrinkle cream is a hydrogent for the skin during the night. It&#x27;s soft and applied smoothly to the face and neck. It will last a long time providing one applies just a dab to the face. Too much will lead to excess cream on the face. Drinking sufficient water is the main product for maintaining proper skin, cream is an enhancer.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it has helped with my wrinkles, I don&#x27;t have many, but it has helped with evening my skin tone.  It is harsh at first but your skin will adjust after a few weeks so stick with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. It makes your skin soft.</li>
    <li> I love the healthy skin anti-wrinkle line.  My skin is incredibly fussy- dry in some spots, oily in others, and the more products I put on to cleanse and moisturizer (I.e. correct it), the worse it looks.  This stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and my skin looks fresh, moisturized, and even in tone.  I use the day and night creams, and the eye cream.  Other than that, just cetaphil at night.  I wish I&#x27;d found this sooner, as I&#x27;m already in my mid-30s!</li>
    <li> Works on hands, chest, and neck.  Has caused minor irritation and small pimples on face.  Not sure yet if I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> It seems to take more lotion. This small tube isn&#x27;t going to last long enough for me to rate it, and I&#x27;m not going to buy another.</li>
    <li> This works really well.  A great, inexpensive retinol product.  Makes my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I was using neutrogena rapid anti wrinkle night moisturizer... By the way I am 36 and have 2 lines in the forehead and a wrinkle in the nose in between eyes. And also lines around eyes... I don&#x27;t prefer to use chemicals near eyes.. So I use organic natural product for around eyes. The rapid anti wrinkle was good.. Still I felt it might be too strong and I don&#x27;t need it now .. In late 30s... Might be in late 40s... So tried this cream which is milder... I am using it for the last 2 weeks... When I wake up every morning and see myself in the mirror... I feel like my face is super clean, fresh and soft...doesn&#x27;t  break out my combination skin... So far so good... Will continue using this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten serious about my skincare since I turned 30. I&#x27;ve read in so many places that in your thirties, you should start adding an over the counter retinol to your routine, so I&#x27;m using this as a preventative measure, not a treatment for current wrinkles. I tried ROC before this but I like the Neutrogena night version the best. The cream consistency feels better on my dry skin, and it seems gentle even with the retinol. The price is great too, particularly through Amazon. I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel much smoother and tight. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but since I like how it feels in the morning, I will try to use it regularly. No irritation at all.</li>
    <li> It is OK. Absorbs pretty fast and doesn&#x27;t leave greasy residue. Doesn&#x27;t diminish wrinkles either though. But it should be expected.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product makes my skin like new again.</li>
    <li> I love that this moisterizer doesn&#x27;t break out my skin but it just doesn&#x27;t hydrate it enough. I have very dry skin and this is more for people with normal skin type. Overall a great moisterizer but just not for me.</li>
    <li> This cream actually dries out my skin a bit, and it&#x27;s not intended to be used every day. Make sure to switch it up between this and some moisturizer to prevent dryness, especially in winter time.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my husband. He applies every night and it has greatly helped his complexion. With the daily 15 SPF he is looking great!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and tend to have problems with some creams due to skin sensitivity, especially those aimed at anti-wrinkle. This cream has not caused any sensitivity issues. Does not feel heavy. I detect no fragrance. It seems to be a good all around moisturizer. I have not seen any spectacular anti-wrinkle miracles and I didn&#x27;t expect them really but I would have like a bit more. The reason I am giving it four stars vs five is that I don&#x27;t seem to think it does much more than moisturize. Other creams I have used in the past seemed to firm the skin more. I haven&#x27;t seen that kind of result with this cream so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light, not greasy at all. will buy it again</li>
    <li> I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN, AND GETTING WRINKLED AND DRY.  I AM GOING TO BE 55 YEARS OLD.  I STARTED TRYING THIS LOTION AFTER A WELL-KNOWN DERMOLOGIST RECOMMENDED IT ON ONE OF THESE TALKS SHOWS, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT A TRY.  SHE ALSO MENTIONED, YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE TO PAY ALOT OF MONEY FOR A GOOD PRODUCT FOR ANTI-AGING.  I USE IT EVERY NIGHT, ALONG WITH THEIR EYE-CREAM.  I AM VERY SATICFIED.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.</li>
    <li> Good ingredients and will continue wearing for the Retinol. The packaging is great since the tube does not allow the ingredients to degrade over time. But should note that it feels very drying to my normal to dry skin. Next time I will try a different product that is not so drying.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a product with retinol. I have used a pearl sized amount of this for 2 consecutive nights now &amp; holy cow does my face hurt. After the 2nd night of using it I woke up and my face was dry and red and burning like I had a bad sunburn and my eyes were so puffy it looked like I had been up all night crying. After my face recovers I might try using this every other night or maybe only a few times per week, but at this point I am wondering if I will be able to use it at all. For first time users, I suggest using this when you don&#x27;t have to go out in public the next day because apparently you can end up with some pretty scary looking skin.</li>
    <li> Nice cream but not as thick a creme as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Yes my skin feels soft. I don&#x27;t have wrinkle issues but I m using it as a preventative measure. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream! I&#x27;m almost 30 and have small wrinkles on the forehead. The cream smooths and moisturizes the skin very well and after using it there is a very pleasant feeling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  I thought it would be a lot more moisturizing than it is.  The weather has been extremely dry and that might be a big part of it, but I still feel it should have been a little better than it is.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at this product and how fast this worked.  I have slight rosacea on my face and i was uncertain if this would affect the skin.  I am very happy, my fine lines have diminished and my skin looks and feels better.  I put it on at night before bed.</li>
    <li> Just what  I expected. Now it wants 16 more words so I will fill the comments with this sentence. One more word, can you believe it??</li>
    <li> I like Neutrogena products in general. They are not too expensive, usually are unscented and work well. My wrinkles get less every night.</li>
    <li> As a brand you know it and it is trust worthy. It gives good results.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin after a month of use but it was a decent moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This did not help me. Perhaps its specific to my skin type, but I broke out severely. This hasnt happened in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried other neutrogena products and they work fine, except this one. So I don&#x27;t think its the cream. Maybe it will work for others. This cream definitely isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This really works!  Give it a month of daily use and you&#x27;ll see a pleasing difference.</li>
    <li> This night cream caused my face to burn, especially around the cheeks. I am surprised that a product made by Neutrogena would cause this. It makes me question all their products. I have purchased Aveeno Positively Radiant Night Cream and have had no adverse reaction.</li>
    <li> I started using this product on April 16, 2014...and as of today, August 4, 2014, I&#x27;m just about through the entire tube. It lasted me quite awhile. I used it as directed...applied a pea size amount at night to my entire face. It seems to have made a difference in the appearance of my skin. I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles but do find that it has softened the texture of my skin thus making it look smoother. It also has lightened my melasma spots as well (I&#x27;ve been battling these spots for years...since my forty&#x27;s... I am now 50 years old...bummer). I have dry skin and find that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red, dry and flaky. It does contain green tea and two forms of vitamin E to help keep the skin moisturized.  It&#x27;s also important to note that &amp;#34;retinol&amp;#34; is listed as the 9th ingredient in this product, which seems good enough for me. It may not be the 4th or 5th ingredient on the  list but it&#x27;s an amount that is &amp;#34;workable.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t necessarily believe that having an exceedingly greater amount of retinol will be better for my skin. Higher doses of retinol may have a negative effect on the skin, leaving it red, flaky and irritable.I believe this Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream works for me,  not only because it has a workable amount of retinol in it but because I&#x27;ve been using it on a consistent basis. It&#x27;s also good to know that the retinol is packaged in a tube rather than in a bottle, to prevent it from degrading.  Another added benefit to using this product is that I don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;break the bank&amp;#34; to get effective results. I would venture to say that the non-prescription strength retinol contained in this cream, along with the affordability of it, results in a longer &amp;#34;wait time&amp;#34; when it comes to seeing results. It slowly but surely has improved the texture and look of my skin.The key is to be patient when looking for results. If you don&#x27;t have the time and patience, then, by all means, use a product with a higher retinol content. But becareful to use smaller amounts to start, even skipping days if necessary, and then increasing it as your skin adapts to it. Otherwise, your skin may end up paying the price. This is an exceptional product...I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to &amp;#34;gently&amp;#34; improve the look and health of their skin.</li>
    <li> Costs about the same as at the drug store but my store does not always carry it. I have used for sometime now and still like it.</li>
    <li> I started to use Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Day and Night Creams when I was in my forties, and after several months of use, a few people, who had known me for years, asked me,&amp;#34;What did you do?  You look younger!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t noticed a remarkable change in my face.  I thought that a brown spot on my cheek looked a little lighter, and I was pleased with that.  I liked  Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream because it kept my skin moist with no irritation, but curiosity got the best of me, and after a while, I wanted to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years passed by, and I was looking for information and reviews on the latest skin products, in the comfort of my own home, on Amazon.  Many new creams on the market made attractive promises, but when I saw that Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Creams were offered on Amazon, I placed my order. I was delighted to receive Neutrogena Healthy Skin Day and Night Anti-Wrinkle Creams that were fresh and moist from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At nearly 70 years of age, a new set of younger friends and acquaintances who had known me for just a few years looked at me, and stated, each independently of the other, with  expressions of wonder, &amp;#34;You look good!&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;You look younger!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, I was surprised.  The only thing that I had done differently in caring for my skin was to return to using Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Day and Night Creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my late forties, I purchased Neutrogena products from the drug store and during my late sixties I purchased my Neutrogena products on Amazon.  Each time that I received comments on my appearance, I had been using Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Day and Night Creams for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to use the 1.4 ounce tube of Neutrogena Healthy Skin Cream to assure freshness and positive results.  Rancid creams are unhealthy.  I credit Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Day and Night Creams  formaking my skin look the best it can no matter what my age.  I thank Amazon for carrying products of worth for their customers.</li>
    <li> I looked at lot&#x27;s of retinal creams before deciding to buy this one. Good price and good product. I se it a bedtime and haven&#x27;t noticed any redness or skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin clear and smooth.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist and works pretty well. Been using it for about 2 weeks now. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product and delivered on time</li>
    <li> greaseless, odorless,</li>
    <li> Not imprrssed.please  cancel my subscription. ,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I&#x27;ve noticed it really evens out my skin and the retinol helps breakouts fade more quickly. I also use retin-a for acne so of course that helps, but this definitely gives it a boost.  I&#x27;m 30 years old and have one or two fine lines on my face. This stuff does make them a little less noticeable but mostly just makes my skin more dewey and bright-looking.  Perhaps keep it off your lips as it can make them a bit flaky.  I think it&#x27;s worth a try for the price.</li>
    <li> I just began to use it for some days.It&#x27;s creamy to the face.Have to wait to see the results.</li>
    <li> Good cream, especially for such price!</li>
    <li> received fast, great product</li>
    <li> Good product. It is as described on Amazon. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good value proposition.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate this product unless you having using it for a while</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  It works.  It may sting initially, but eventually you will learn to love it.  I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> 38 year old male into my second week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No irritation the first few days like I have read others having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on with ease and no greasy after feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels hydrated all night.</li>
    <li> great cream &amp; great price &amp; has sunscreen as well ~ like it as well as some higher price creams</li>
    <li> Product works! My face is normally intolerable to any cream as I break out with rashes afterwards. And so, I&#x27;ve left my face alone without any cream for years, precisely since my tenage years (in my late 30s now). I came across this product while searching for a possible cream that will leave my skin with no rashes afterwards. First I liked the fact that its a night cream as I wont have to deal with any possible oily residue it might end up having. And secondly I was impressed with tge reviews so I decided to try it out. Its been about a month now of nightly usage after cleasing and I&#x27;m so overjoyed as to how smooth and soft my face looks. Back here to order 2 more!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite night cream now. I&#x27;ve tried so many other brands and I keep coming back to this one. I&#x27;m not going to try any more brands! I wish it came in a bigger size and maybe not in the metal type container but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. I have dry skin that also breaks out...lucky me.....this cream (as well as the other ones in the same line) do a wonderful job of moisturizing, getting rid of that dry fine line look and also helps my break outs. Also, my skin looks much clearer too.</li>
    <li> I like this product and had used it before.  Gets a good rating from cosmetic reviewers.  It arrived quickly and as advertized.</li>
    <li> A great night cream I put all over my face before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a moderately priced anti-aging cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed when putting on a blemish overnight I wake up the next morning with no blemish in sight!</li>
    <li> Has helped my wrinkles and dark spots, like the feel and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> My roots felt squeky clean after using the Neutrogena Anti-Residue shampoo. But my hair was frizzy and the ends felt extremely dry I&#x27;m going to try using my condition just on the ends next time I use it. My regular shampoo seemed to work the same the day after but my roots definitely felt extremely clean and residue free . I&#x27;m just not sure how I feel about it yet with how frizzy and dry the rest of my hair felt but it was nice to have my roots get some attention as I do use a lot of products and sometimes I have to shampoo twice so my roots won&#x27;t be greasy. Going to try to use and then use conditioner on the ends but at this point don&#x27;t see the real reason to spend extra money on buying this instead of just finding a shampoo that completes my needs....</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this is ANY stores.  Neutrogena makes something similar in a pump, but I hear that it&#x27;s pretty harsh on the skin.  I got this due to rave reviews -- and Thank You Amazon for carrying it --- and I absolutely love it.  I wear it almost nightly under my moisturizer.  My skin is smoother and appears fresher in the morning.  It did make my nose peel a little bit, but that&#x27;s when I take a night off.  I really like this and hopefully can continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING I EVER BOUGHT FROM NUTROGENA IS FIRST QUALITY AND RIGHT ON THE DOT FOR WHAT I EXPECTED.</li>
    <li> Gentle on skin and keeps skin looking healthy.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of creams, this one is so, so. I did not see any difference.</li>
    <li> You see the result after a week or so.</li>
    <li> This product is not a moisturizer! is extremely irritating and gave no benefit to my skin whatsoever. Also, was very irritating and caused me to get a rash similar to Rosacea.(yes. I read the directions which said it could cause &amp;#34;redness&amp;#34; if used in excess. this happened with first usage of pea size amount). Needless to say. I am extremely disappointed. I can&#x27;t imagine whose skin could possibly benefit from this product unless there is some other product to use in conjunction with it that will cancel all the negatives, but why bother when there are so many other good night creams out there? Sorry Neutrogena, but this is not one of them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about two weeks. So far so good. My skin is softer and looks smooth.</li>
    <li> Skin feels smoother. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to judge anti wrinkle effectiveness</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something to use that was less expensive than the department store products I have been using.  I used it for a little over a month and noticed that I was breaking out bad!!!  My forehead looked horrible.  I stopped using it immediately and after a couple of weeks my skin started to clear up and it is pretty much back to normal ow.  I am 30 and have a few wrinkles and am looking to prevent any more future (to a degree) wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 8 weeks and it&#x27;s been great so far. It helps keep pimples away, i used to get new pimples everyday but now i get one or two a month. I stopped using it for about a week and the pimples came back so i know it&#x27;s this product that&#x27;s helping. It makes my skin smoother and helps with dryness. I don&#x27;t notice any smell and i don&#x27;t think it makes my skin oily. I would recommend this product to anyone, i have a subscription to have it sent to me every 3 months so it&#x27;s a great deal for something that really works, i hope this stuff is made forever.</li>
    <li> Have always trusted Neutrogena and this product lives up to my expectations.  My skin still breaksout and this product leaves my skin soft but it does not cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few days, but I do like the way it goes on and feels on my skin.  If things continue like this  will say five star.</li>
    <li> Just as described A++++++</li>
    <li> When I first got this product 1 month ago I felt like the texture felt great on my skin and I loved the fact that it is oil free. After 1.5 weeks of using this my face started to break out. I started off with 1 zit and now I can count 6. I think it would be a great product for someone with dry skin but not combination or oily.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I was able to tell the difference from day 2. It is very strong so use small amounts.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I have seen any results yet - about six weeks - but it isn&#x27;t oily and works well under my foundation.</li>
    <li> The product information says that it may cause some irritation, and it did.  I&#x27;ll try using it once or twice a week, but I need a moisturizer I can use every night, so I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is actually making a difference in my skin! I&#x27;ve been using everynight for 2 weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion looks more even and my skin is becoming smoother. I&#x27;ve been mixing it with a dab of petroleum jelly and applying all over a damp face and neck, and left over on my hands, and that does the trick to moisterize. My face skin is dry and combination and not many creams alone moisterize it enough. It takes a pearl sized amount of this for your face and neck. I&#x27;m 31, and have forehead wrinkles. I&#x27;m not noticing any reduction in those, but time will tell. So far so good with this!</li>
    <li> I like its smooth feel when I apply it on the face. It actually clears the thin line in 6 weeks. I am 33 and loving what this product is doing for me. I usually get a lot of break outs, but together with the clear pore wash and daily moisturizer with sunscreen, am good to go!</li>
    <li> I tried this out because of the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference, but that could be because I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this will help me not get bad wrinkles as I get older...&lt;br /&gt;NEVER TOO EARLY TOO START!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent priced and good if you have acne prone oily skin. It has more retinol than its higher priced neutrogena cousins like rapid wrinkle but from my research you can&#x27;t really minimize wrinkles so I consider this preventive care</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and have loved how it feels on my skin.  It has just the right amount of retinal for my needs and leaves my face smooth and clear.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, and I wish I had started using it in my thirties.  I like the Intensives line slightly more now that I&#x27;m 50 though.  The subscribe and save makes it a great deal.</li>
    <li> Works, much cheaper than pthers</li>
    <li> Wake up with smooth, glowing skin, love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Holy crap, this came like within two days and it works really, really well! For the price that it is, it&#x27;s really good quality.</li>
    <li> Good use as night lotion! As creme doesn&#x27;t  works as perfect care!? This is just a lotion in expensive tube!</li>
    <li> So far it has improved my fine lines of my 29 year old porcelain skin, but it has started to make my skin blotchy and dry. Per the directions I will hold off on treating my fine lines until my skin adjusts and only apply every few days. It is very light and nice and I&#x27;m sure if I wasn&#x27;t scrubbing my face with a washcloth every night to get rid of the days make up so I could apply the cream it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad… after all I only recently started doing that as well.</li>
    <li> This is the first anti-wrinkle night cream I&#x27;ve used that showed some results in 2 weeks - minor \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; results but real.  Had to skip using it for 2 days due to some mild skin irritation which went away.  I&#x27;ve readjusted my schedule of use to skip every 2nd day to prevent the irritation and that is working for me.  On the skipped day, I use a milder cream that seems to soothe.  I don&#x27;t know what the long term effects will be but will try to remember to report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/26/2014 Follow-up:  The \\&quot;minor smoothing\\&quot; results I reported after 2 weeks turned out to be as much as I got from this \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; cream. Maybe it prevented some wrinkles from deepening but I&#x27;ll never know about that. It might \\&quot;fight\\&quot; wrinkles but it sure won&#x27;t remove them, so if you keep your hopes realistic, you might want to try this for yourself. Personally, I&#x27;ve stopped using it and am now using L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect night cream alone and it is keeping my skin just as smooth as it was after I used this product.  It also feels better going on and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  Maybe all we can hope for from a bottled cream is some minor smoothing, some maintenance, and maybe some prevention of wrinkling.  I think any real \\&quot;repairs&#x27; require much more drastic measures.  That&#x27;s life.</li>
    <li> This has been my night cream for years, now easy to order.</li>
    <li> these kind of products apparently burn and cause redness at first... which was exactly the opposite of what I was looking for. I didn&#x27;t stick with it long enough to see it through to the other side.</li>
    <li> While it does not work miracles, it is a good moisturizer that will slightly help slight wrinkling.</li>
    <li> Although I like Neutrogena products this particular item caused me to break out.  The product label does warn of possible break outs due to the retinol.  I did as the packaging advised and after a few weeks I had to give up cause it just slowly got worse.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative to my usual products and this just was not it.  Guess I will be going back to using Anthony Logistics products.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is excellent. If nothing else, it is a nice, rich cream that goes on without leaving my skin greasy. I&#x27;ve been using it for a short time and have noticed some differences in my forehead lines. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my 73yo mum. According to her, after using the product for 2 weeks, her wrinkles at the corner of her eyes had diminishes, which is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I like the feel and texture of this product and did not experience any reaction and it made my skin feel soft and supple</li>
    <li> So great to use such a small amount &amp; feel as if it&#x27;s working!  Great price/excellent product, but I&#x27;m not expecting miracles @ 60+...</li>
    <li> very good stuff, makes my skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> Non greasy or sticky, a very good night cream.  The change in my skin was noticeable since the very first week  Love it.</li>
    <li> Just started using. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I have used this product and am in the process of comparing it to several others. So far I am pleased at the results. The product arrived quickly and the price was right. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Seems to help.  Not allergic to it either.  Will start to peel sometimes and just skip a few nights and use more moisturizer.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I had ready reviews and this is why I purchased it.  Have been using it for just 2 weeks, but I believe it is making my facial skin softer.  I would definitely order it again !</li>
    <li> It make my skin dry .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this nighttime lotion ever since I read the reviews on beautypedia.com. All you need is a pea-size drop and it covers your entire face. No greasy residue. I hope they never stop making this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy.  I don&#x27;t use products.  Except this product.  I like this product.  That&#x27;s it - 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 and don&#x27;t really have noticeable wrinkles yet so I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s ability to reduce already-present wrinkles (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but I LOVE the way it works on my skin. I&#x27;ve had issues in the past with very dry skin on my face and this took care of that almost immediately. Best of all, the ingredients are noncomedogenic! I am extremely acne prone and this product does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I wake up looking refreshed. For the price, doesn&#x27;t get better!</li>
    <li> SPF must be reapplied or its counter productive. Fine as a sunscreen or a facial lotion, but both is kinda silly. Makes for an expensive sunscreen if reapplied properly.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff, has the desired effect. Got several comments on looking younger !</li>
    <li> A super good product.  Really like it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of months now and I have noticed that my pores are much smaller, the crows feet around my eyes are gone, my skin tone looks great, and any pimples that pop up go away within 2 days.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bc I read it was a good OTC retinol product. It didn&#x27;t work well for me at all. I much prefer Neutrogena Tone Correcting Serum and cream. The tone correcting serum also has retinol and I had typical retinol effects with that one, which is what I was hoping for with this product:  I wil not repurchase this unless it was on super sale, lol. However, I will  purchase the Tone Correcting serum  again as that provided better retinol results than this did.</li>
    <li> i love this night cream.  it is fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, nor does it clog my pores.  i always get compliments on my skin.  i credit it mostly to genetics, but i do make an effort to take care of my skin as well.  not a lot of sun, moisturizer, and healthy living.  every little bit helps!</li>
    <li> It works. Its light. and no smell</li>
    <li> It is good to buy as good as before!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and I don&#x27;t look a day over 40&lt;br /&gt;I can boast this because I exercise and I take care of my skin&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for years&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smooth and radiant&lt;br /&gt;It competes and surpasses the more expensive skin creams</li>
    <li> Really like this as a great economical night creme</li>
    <li> Very smooth, not harsh. I love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE!! The first night I put it on I woke up in the morning and my face felt like it was a baby!</li>
    <li> This is a fine skin cream , it reduced pore size, improved my complexion&#x27;s color and uniformity , didn&#x27;t irritate it and didn&#x27;t induce acne. I wear it daily prior going to bed and at afternoon if I am not going out ..definately improved my skin overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit : after using this cream for more than 3 weeks now on daily basis I can say it has no effect on my age spots however, it does improve drastically pore sizes and makes my skin looks smooth and soft. will definately re-order</li>
    <li> Great product. It isn&#x27;t oily at all. After several days my skin looks brighter and stable. I will consider to buy them again,</li>
    <li> i like the product and the price is right.  there are so man offered in drug stores that it&#x27;s a real time saver to be able to just order to one we want.</li>
    <li> This night cream is reasonably priced and holds up under winter furnace heat and low humidity outside.  I keep coming back to it after trying other products.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. In the winter especially, my skin will have simultaneous dry patches and breakouts. This moisturizer is the best I&#x27;ve found for eliminating the dry skin issue. It provides a smoothing base under makeup and makes it look more natural. I use the &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; formulation during the day as my makeup already contains a sunscreen, and too much sunscreen can make my face break out. You may want the SPF formula for day use if you need a sunscreen. This moisturizer will not enlarge your pores and is good under the eye area as well. (Did you know that &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; under-eye moisturizers are a scam?) Skip the fancy packaging and expensive moisturizers. This is all you need.</li>
    <li> I used to use their acne products before switching to a combination of cheaper benzoyl peroxide alternatives and flaxseed oil pills. The acne products are effective but this wrinkle cream was not. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and maybe that&#x27;s not long enough, but I&#x27;m ready to move on to a cheaper natural wrinkle remedy like coconut oil or something.</li>
    <li> Horrible. It made my skin red and sore around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I like Neutrogena. Alway on spot</li>
    <li> Actually Made Wrinkles Worse!  I&#x27;m amazed at the good reviews on this product.  I didn&#x27;t expect overnight results by any means, however I didn&#x27;t expect my wrinkles to be MORE visible.  I&#x27;d say.....save your money and look for another product.  BTW......it didn&#x27;t sting.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in despair after Neutrogena discontinued Oil-Free Acne Stress Control® 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment. But I found I liked this product better. True I am older and it is time to switch to a more intense moisturizing regime, but this product really worked. I know Neutrogena has put Oil-Free Acne Stress Control® 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment back on the market but I am sticking with this Anti-wrinkle stuff from now on. I highly recommend this to anyone over the age of 25 who has the intelligence to wash their face before bedtime. Use this, it may not get rid of wrinkles but it really does keep your face softer and prevents peeling and helps heal sun damage. I speak from experience. This stuff is not a miracle (most products are not) but it really does a good job and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This is a good cream. It&#x27;s lightweight and glides over my face really well with just a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> I like this skin cream a lot!</li>
    <li> It works alright, but it&#x27;s nothing special compared to others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I like that this cream is not greasy and has no scent, but I&#x27;ve used the whole tube and notice no difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve also tried a product from ROC that actually tingles a bit when you first apply but has a scent that&#x27;s too strong.  I will look for something else.</li>
    <li> Product that I am familiar with at a great price with prompt delivery</li>
    <li> I am a young woman and Im always looking for something to help keep my skin looking young and fresh and healthy. This product is AMAZING. I used just a pearl size amount every night after cleansing and my face stays moisturized the whole day after I wake up and after about a week I really started to notice that my skin tone was even and smooth. Great buy</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it has a great light weight, non greasy feel to it.  Perfect to put on right before bed.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena night cream is the best retinol night cream I have ever used.  I have sensitive skin, and this cream  has given me no problem.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen chemicals and sufficiently light enough that I use if for daytime. Many creams cause me to break out ~ this one does not.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product, gentle and effective!  I alternate this every other night with Alpha Hydrox 10 percent from Neo stra, and it appears to be working!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 1 weeks already and the review on this is not for me. I was looking so forward in using this product since there are so many good reviews on it, but i dont see any improvement on my skin, i feel like I mentioned burning around my eye area and my face gets hot. I also use the eye cream and it is the same thing. I feel my skin dry not moisturized. I am dissapointed with this product and going to search for another cream.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this inexpensive cream works better than any costly creams I&#x27;ve used before. I wrote a review on the eye cream also because I was so happy with it. I had almost ruined the skin under my eyes with a product I had ordered from a shopping channel. I read the reviews on this product and the eye cream, ordered them and the skin under my eyes improved overnight along with the rest of my face. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> I really believe that this product works and have bought here multiple times now. Good price for a great product that I believe in!</li>
    <li> A good moisturizer for night.</li>
    <li> Great texture and feel. Didn&#x27;t make me breakout but didn&#x27;t see a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I have normal/slightly oily skin, I was looking for a daily light moisturizer that would not not increase my breakouts. This product was recommended on paulaschoice.com. I&#x27;m fairly young so I did not purchase it for the anti-wrinkle properties. I was looking for a product to help reduce some sun damage i.e. freckles, and has some anti-oxidants. This product is one of the more inexpensive retinol products on the market. I can&#x27;t say that I see any visible difference in my skin, but I know the product is helping with skin cell renewal. The box says it could be 8 weeks until I see any signs of fading brown spots, even if I see no change, it&#x27;s a nice light moisturizer. I also finally found it sold at CVS so I won&#x27;t have to purchase it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I bought it based on Paula Begoun&#x27;s recommendation, and it does not disappoint. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost six months, and it helps my skin to look smoother and clearer. The price is very reasonable, too, when compared to other similar skin care items. I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be ok. It&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s also not great. Not for me at least. I read a lot of people raving about this product. It was even a top contender of Paula&#x27;s choice beautpedia. So much for that. Ive been using this for a little over a month, and haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes in my skin. On the other hand I find it to be a nice night moisturizer to mix with my retin a cream. Not sure if the formula has changed, because I have heard a few people saying they are now using a lot less retinol than before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this night cream for a few months now (a lot of people expect immediate results from creams, but it takes time!) and I&#x27;m very pleased with the difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m 33, with very fair/sensitive skin that is also prone to break outs on my chin...lucky me! This cream is not greasy at all and my skin never feels dry when I wake up. It hasn&#x27;t caused me any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt; In the last 2.5 months, I have noticed a tremendous difference in my skin. My fine lines/wrinkles are still there, but much smoother and less defined. My pores are practically nonexistent, and my overall skin tone is much more even...sometimes I&#x27;m tempted to not even wear powder because I don&#x27;t really need it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are much more expensive products out there that could do an even better job of reducing wrinkles and smoothing out your skin, but if you don&#x27;t have hundreds to spend on beauty products this is really a great product. You will see results, but give it time. Also, make sure to use a exfoliating scrub (like st.Ives) a couple of times a week to wash away dead skin that can leave your complexion dull and clog your pores.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE!!!! I&#x27;ve never broke out like this before!!!! :/ so upset. Would NEVER recommend!! Threw the product away. So disappointing. Wasted money :(</li>
    <li> I love this night cream and the eye serum that goes with it. I am 40 years young and look the same age as my 20 something friends!</li>
    <li> Being that I am only 23 I cant say I have \\&quot;deep lines\\&quot; or big problem areas, but I did want to start taking care of the fine lines around my eyes, most of night time moisturizers are just way to heavy and since my skin is finicky being oily one day and dry the next I was afraid using retinol was going to be an issue, but thankfully for me this product did nothing but good for both my skin and my fine lines. I use it more heavily around my eyes which are the issues and it works well, I also didn&#x27;t realize my forehead was getting rough but in using this every is smooth and my skin looks better overall. I also use the neutrogena radiance face cream with spf in it to help defend against further lines.</li>
    <li> This cream feels light on my face which I like and it keeps my face moisturized.I haven&#x27;t noticed any real benefits regarding wrinkles yet, but I have only been using it for 3 weeks. I will order it again!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about the age of this product.  I buy this product on a regular basis and frequently the color of this cream ranges from white to a cream color.  The color on this particular product was more yellow - I wasn&#x27;t sure about it but used it anyway.  It didn&#x27;t seem to cause any break-out.  However, I have since purchased this from other vendors and again the color of the cream ranges from white to a cream color.</li>
    <li> I have always had red skin all through my t zone, I&#x27;ve always worn foundation to cover it. Little did I guess when I bought, the redness would go away as well as having soft smooth skin, I forgot how smooth. I&#x27;m 48, who would guess that an anti wrinkle cream world get rid of redness so well I don&#x27;t wear foundation and my skin looks amazing, better than at 30.</li>
    <li> I do like all the Neutrogena products that I have tried.  They have always delivered as advertised.  This product is no exception.  I use it on my forehead and between my eyes.  With consistant use, for me, it has reduced the appearance of lines in that area.  It is light weight and rubs into the skin very cleanly with no grease feel to it left on the skin.  It does not leave my skin dry at all.  It leaves it very smooth and soft feeling.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about a week, and my skin looks nice. I&#x27;m using it as a preventative measure for no wrinkles so I haven&#x27;t seen major results because I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and there is no weird residue on my face the next morning. It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
    <li> Definitely brightens my skin, and softens the lines. I use it every other night, otherwise it will irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of products in this department, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to another one.  I believe it was an o.k. moisturizer and I&#x27;d probably use it again.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and very soothing.  No smell.  Fades darker spots too.  Nice product  and great price.  Does help get rid of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I am 26 and have been using this product for about three weeks.  I don&#x27;t have many signs of wrinkles yet, but I have battled hormonal acne since my teens.  Although oral minocycline was effective against my acne, it wasn&#x27;t ideal as a long-term solution.  I have tried lots of different products over the years formulated for fighting acne, including over-the-counter solutions containing benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, as well as ProActiv and Differin gel.  Either they didn&#x27;t work very well, or they were harsh and dried my skin out.  I also tried Retin-A Micro at one point, which contains a stronger version of the retinol in this product, and it caused terrible dryness and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been very effective in clearing up my acne in the short term.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness or peeling at all, and my breakouts are much reduced.  Plus, a bonus is that maybe I&#x27;m warding off any impending wrinkles.  For adults who are still experiencing acne problems, I would suggest giving this product a shot.  It&#x27;s cost effective too, because one tube should last months.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product for me to against light aging. It is affordable to students as well.&lt;br /&gt;I use it two days in a row and then rest for one day, apply some VB3 products before it to reduce the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;About a couple of weeks later, you will see the texture of your face is changed, smooth without spot.&lt;br /&gt;You really need to apply sunblock in the day, otherwise the UVA will definitely destroy you.&lt;br /&gt;Love it anyway.</li>
    <li> I typically use an organic night cream that costs around $30. I wanted to save on my skin products, so I bought this; I must, say it works well so far! I have VERY oily skin; the oilyness of my skin has not gone away, however, this night cream helps control it, so that when I wake up in the morning I am not too shiny! You only need half a dime size of product, so it lasts!</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist told me to start using this when I was 25 since i had a bad scaly patch and just could never ever get a grip on my dry skin. I have super dry skin and had been trying all kinds of stuff, even vasoline and olive oil. My skin is so dry it hurts after I take a shower. Anyway I&#x27;ve used this, and only this plus the other night one in the pump - and my skin looks awesome and I&#x27;m almost 40 now. I stopped when I was pregnant, and when I had the baby as these creams may not be good for pregnant ladies or infants (they don&#x27;t know but it&#x27;s a lot of vitamin A so play it safe). I just used coconut oil (straight) during those times. EVERYONE has always told me they CANNOT believe my age, I look way way young for my age. I can show you a photo if you want.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti Wrinkle Night Cream is one of the better products that I have used in some time.  Before I purchase any skin care product I check it out on Beautypedia.com.  This website has saved me a lot of time, frustration, and money.  This night cream is light, fragrance free, &amp; non-greasy.  It has a fair amount of retinol, green tea, and small amounts of (2) forms of Vitamin E plus it is packaged properly so that the beneficial ingredients are not exposed to the light, air, &amp; bacteria that destroys them.  It is reasonably priced and I agree with Beautypedia&#x27;s review that it is &#x27;one of the better retinol products to be found at the drugstore&#x27;.  It is certainly worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am (57) years old and I do NOT expect any lotion or cream to make me look as I did in my 20&#x27;s; however if I use this cream on a regular basis I absolutely can tell a difference in my skin tone and the overall appearance of my complexion.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help control acne as well as be a good wrinkle cream and this is the right product for the job! I use it with Neutrogena Anti wrinkle Anti Blemish cleanser and the combo is great for me! People with sensitive skin may need to be careful with this combo, but I have had no issues. There is info out there warning that using AHA/BHA products can reduce the effectiveness of Retinol as well as some that says that is not true and fine to use together. I did extensive research before purchasing both products and the consensus I came to is that there isn&#x27;t enough AHA/BHA in the cleanser to make the Retinol in the cream ineffective and also there isn&#x27;t even enough evidence to prove that it would make it ineffective in the first place. I made the right decision because after using this for only a short amount of time I am already seeing results. My skin is soft, fine lines are diminishing, and my adult acne is under control. Love Love Love this!!!</li>
    <li> A great light moisturizer, I use this morning and evening.</li>
    <li> I use this during the day since my face make up already has SPF 15 in it.</li>
    <li> came in very quick,happy with product will order it agin. this cream has worked quite well and i will continue to use it .</li>
    <li> This is an effective night cream (with active and natural ingredients - multivitamins and green tea) that moisturises as well as targets wrinkles and skin discoloration.  Its light and fragrance free texture makes it suitable for most skin types, ideally for 25years+ to matured skin.  Noticeable smoother and brighter complexion in five weeks.  Can be used on other parts of body e.g., hands and arms.  A wonderful skin care product at an affordable price, big thanks to Neutrogena.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LP, Melbourne. Australia</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about six weeks and already I have seen improvements on my facial skin texture and fine wrinkles. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products. This is some of the best night cream I have used - especially for the price. I have sensitive skin, so many things cause me to have breakouts or rashes. This didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve used it all, so have to order more. It&#x27;s worth a try! Even a second one.</li>
    <li> I began getting very large and painful cysts on my chin like clockwork every month after I had an IUD inserted. A little bit of research clearly indicated this acne in my mid-20&#x27;s was hormonal and excessively hard to treat without dermatologist intervention. However, I did see it mentioned that research indicated that creams with retinoids could help. So I picked this up as something to try before going in for a prescription strength option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice much for the first two weeks - then I developed a really rough patch on my chin for 3-4 days. I pushed through and things went uphill fast from there. My skin looks fresh and smooth every morning. It&#x27;s helped significantly reduce the appearance of my former acne scars. Best of all, my monthly hormonal acne is a lot better! I still get a couple of manageable spots, but nothing like the big painful cysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is very light (now in the dead of winter, sometimes it feels a bit too light, but I just use a heavier daytime moisturizer), fragrance free, and one small tube lasts a long time - you only need to apply a pea-sized amount. I wish all my beauty rituals were this easy and inexpensive!</li>
    <li> This is listed as a night cream but I rarely use it at night. Being a retinol product without sunscreen they are now calling this a night cream. The idea behind retinol is that it sluffs off dead skin cells which actually does a pretty great job. At night my skin needs to rejuvenate from the stuff that was stuffed off during the day by my daytime retinol. This just isn&#x27;t that kind of cream that will nourish your skin at night. I still use this occasionally since it is a good retinol cream but during the day with a good sunscreen on top if I&#x27;m going outdoors.</li>
    <li> I can visibly see a difference after a couple weeks of using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old with the start of fine lines and uneven color (I spent lots of time outside with no sunscreen). I&#x27;ve used this stuff for 3 days and can see the difference in my face - the lines have become smoother, my complexion evening out, it doesnt make my combination skin break out, doesn&#x27;t cause overdrying or sensitivity (like the Mary Kay Timewise stuff I used for a minute), and feels really nice on my skin, not like greasy moisturizers. Love it!</li>
    <li> By far the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of wrinkle creams. I love that it also moisturizes without being greasy or heavy. Even got my husband hooked on it. Even though the price changes on Amazon, I still haven&#x27;t found it for less anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Feels nice going on. Skin looks good waking up. Overall my skin still lacks hydration so if you have very dry skin like me you might need to combine this with another product.</li>
    <li> Meh.... for what you pay, it&#x27;s not worth the results.  Don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This cream didn&#x27;t impress me at all. Maybe because I prefer serums and lots of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a cream that does not look oily, then it might be for you.&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena is a very good company and I like their sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This product is really awesome! I&#x27;m using it everyday or I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year. I can recommend this product 100% to my friends, but problem is the packaging it is very bad.</li>
    <li> Great face cream. Recommend it</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  My skin feels better every time I use it.</li>
    <li> This cream feels great on my dry skin. I apply it over a serum and together it helps my skin stay hydrated. It goes on smoothly and sinks in right away.</li>
    <li> After a month of use I am very happy with this cream.  I have combination skin that is sensitive to new products, especially if they are fragranced or oily. Lots of products either irritate my skin or cause an acne outbreak. This cream did not bother my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any drying or irritation that the other reviews &amp; packaging warn about, despite the current dry winter weather.  I did avoid the area around my eyes for the first week of use (to acclimate my skin to it) and I only apply it around my eyes every 2nd or 3rd day.&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone was pretty much immediately brighter (really). After about a week my skin coloring started evening out (redness, dark spots) and that still seems to be improving.  Fine lines are less noticeable/diminished, I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in the one deep line I have at the corner of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- No fragrance, good value for the price (very small amount needed), not heavy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- None I&#x27; noticed.</li>
    <li> I have been happy with this cream. I use it every night and have not had any irritation, even though I have sensitive skin and eczema. I use this as a preventative for wrinkles and also to nourish my ridiculously dry skin without the SPF in my other moisturizer. I have been very happy with how well this cream works so far! Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> It feels great on your skin, hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts, and I swear the fine lines around my eyes have softened. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This was shipped with a paper envelope and it damaged my lotion little bit, but i didnt complain, it just a cheap lotion..&lt;br /&gt;but it will does what is supposed to to. In nights, i apply this and it keeps the moisture on your skin.</li>
    <li> Caused breakout. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> You can count on Neutrogena esp. When it is freezing cold and you need that extra boost of skin moisture and protection. Have always loved their products .</li>
    <li> Not much different than any other kind.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I started seeing a difference in the evenness of my skin almost immediately. I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Its a good product but I tend to forget to put cream at night.  I am too tired and sometimes lazy.</li>
    <li> This is my first retinol product and so far I&#x27;ve been pleased. I understand it takes a while to see the results, so I&#x27;m trying to be patient.  So far I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
    <li> I have used this before with good results. It is smooth and creamy and definitely helps with reducing the visible lines around the upper cheeks and eyes without any burning or stinging. It is odorless and does not cause the eyes to tear when used lightly all over the face. For the results obtained the price is lower than similar types of anti-aging creams.</li>
    <li> Better than ANY other face cream I have ever tried. Don&#x27;t spend your money on expensive department store crap. Your paying for advertising and packaging! This cream is the best and cheapest. Have been using it ever day since my 20&#x27;s. I&#x27;m now in my mid 40s and I&#x27;m still using it! Wish I could give it 10 stars</li>
    <li> I do believe I see a difference in how smooth my skin is and lines are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Arrived in timely fashionm</li>
    <li> Like others, I found this on beautypedia. It works - I&#x27;m in my late 20s and have some dry spotting occurring near my eyes and some mild fine lines in the eye/forehead area and mild acne/hyperpigmentation spots. This formula is gentle on my sensitive skin, unscented, and works great. I can even get my boyfriend to use it on some of his fine line areas since it doesn&#x27;t smell too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The Mrs believes in these.</li>
    <li> I like it so far. I have been using this product for 4days now and I can see the different. I&#x27;m happy about the result.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to begin taking better care of my skin. I&#x27;ve always had pretty good skin, but now that I&#x27;m getting older I figured I should start really watching what I put (and don&#x27;t put) on it. I read online (mostly Beautypedia) about the great effects of Retinol on the skin, so I began my search for a good Retinol product I could use at night. I have used products across all price ranges, but no matter how many high-end moisturizers/skincare products I try (I used to love Laura Mercier), I usually find myself coming back to Neutrogena products because they are well-priced (especially now that I&#x27;m on a student budget) and effective. I was very happy to discover that this product is rated a &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; on Beautypedia, and one of the cheapest of the kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I love how it feels on my skin. I have somewhat sensitive skin, so I prefer unscented products, which this one is. It hydrates my skin and makes it glow, and my skin is usually still soft in the mornings, despite being quite dry naturally. I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference in my skin, but it may be because I haven&#x27;t begun to develop wrinkles yet. But I think that long-term use of this product will probably help prevent wrinkles from developing anytime soon!</li>
    <li> I like Neutrogena, this one is really good, it feels light on your skin. Beware if you have sensitive skin that tends to redness - this will enhance the redness</li>
    <li> Not as good as the reviews, have saw no difference yet....</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this product. No greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Excellent  article. It arrived at time</li>
    <li> Use this all the time.</li>
    <li> Was highly skeptical in purchasing initially.  But it is amazing how smoothe and healthy it has made my facial skin look after only 2 weeks of use.  I am a 30yo male and would recommend it to others that have excess dry skin and sun spots.  It is also very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well to repair my skin at night. Reduces blemishes and helps to regenerate skin. I use it occasionally though since my skin is a bit sensitive.</li>
    <li> Nice texture for bedtime, doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my skin, and isn&#x27;t too thick so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a mask to bed.  Also, added bonus is that it shrank a broken capillary on my nose to where it&#x27;s nearly invisible, hooray! Only drawback is the packaging, as the metal tube makes it difficult to get the last bit out.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a positive imporvement in my skin. My pores are smaller and I rarely break out anymore. The few pimples I do still have resolve more quickly.</li>
    <li> will buy again and again</li>
    <li> Really like this product. On my second box. Still have fine lines especially around my mouth but they look smoother. Goes on nicely and is not greasy. Product as described. Would use this seller again</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Retinol cream. It isn&#x27;t a serum, but a nice light cream that goes on easily and sinks into my skin quickly. I prefer this over serums I have used because it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my skin (my skin is normal/dry, but I don&#x27;t like an oily feeling.) This is just right.</li>
    <li> Great results and I&#x27;m making this part of my daily care.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this for wrinkles  I don&#x27;t have a lot but the few I do have did not change over a couple of months using this cream.  I finally gave up.</li>
    <li> My mother and I both love this (she&#x27;s in her early 50&#x27;s, i&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s). This leaves our skin soooo soft and feeling moisturized and hydrated without an oily slick. She has eczema and this goes very well on her skin, I have very sensitive combination skin and this has never broken me out at all. In the winter I have also applied this during AM hours to keep my skin from feeling dry during the day. We love this and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had used this product years ago but got away from it.  After spending much more money on other face creams, I&#x27;m glad I came back to my original love.  Just a small amount of Neutrogena goes a long way.  I use it once each night and it really takes care of the fine lines.  I noticed a visible difference in just a couple of days.  I&#x27;ll stick with Neutrogena this time, I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.</li>
