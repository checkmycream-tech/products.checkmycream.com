      <li>The hull looks so elegant,  you can use it with one hand.  </li>
      <li>I made sure to keep this lip gloss in my car and use it every morning.</li>
      <li>This feels okay on my lips, and I appreciate the SPF 20, but the color was too flat, too matte--not attractive at all</li>
      <li>Quick shipment!  </li>
      <li>I love the little mirror on the top of the tube, great for checking applications on the go.</li>
      <li>Lasts a decent amount of time and wears off evenly, What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
      <li>I first purchased it at a spa and was so excited to find it on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>Berry is just the right amount of color!</li>
      <li>I have used this and have noticed absolutely nothing outstanding about it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for years to replace my old favorite from Benefit that they discontinued.  </li>
      <li>It is pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>Completely worth the price.</li>
      <li>I bought this lipstick in Sheer Berry last year and absolutely LOVED it!  </li>
      <li>My sister who was visiting noticed it right away, so she ordered some.</li>
      <li>The price point may be a bit higher than some but worth it.</li>
      <li>recommended by a professional trainer, so we are going to give it a try, should be just fine, birthday gift for trainer</li>
      <li>It makes them go on so much smoother!</li>
      <li>It glides on so smooth and leaves my lips feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>This is the first lipstick I have used that does NOT chap my lips.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my lips soft and full looking.</li>
      <li>After two years, it&#x27;s really visible.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for two years, and I can attest that it really does work.</li>
      <li>It goes on much lighter than it appears in the tube.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t stay on any better than any other balm, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my lips being fuller, softer, etc....</li>
      <li>It is a lovely shade of wine (not too dark) with just a hint of sparkle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not easy to apply and would not be good enough to buy again.</li>
      <li>high gloss look.</li>
      <li>It has lasted all year and really keeps my lips healthy year round!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try their new glosses.</li>
      <li>but no where near as pink as the original.  </li>
      <li>The cost of this pretty little silver container isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
      <li>B001L11UGU Kaplan MD Lip 20 Treatment, Natural, 0.11 Ounce]]</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t show any color on the lip as far as I can tell.  </li>
      <li>: I use the clear as a primer to my red, matte lipsticks.</li>
      <li>The colors are sheer and natural, and I reapply about 3 times during the day without having to put liip balm under it.  </li>
      <li>I have every color, though the natural is probably my \\&quot;daily driver\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It is not a quick fix, but rather a daily treatment that really does give your lips a little \\&quot;oopmh\\&quot; over time, while also making them smooth and protecting them from the sun.</li>
      <li>Unlike other glosses that I have tried, this one isn&#x27;t even a bit sticky and has a very natural looking shine rather than that</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two years, and I can attest that it really does work. It&#x27;s not overnight, and it may take several months, but it does truly work. My lip line had been disappearing for some time, and my lips were somewhat flat. After nightly use for a couple of months, I began to notice my lip line returning, and my lips looked noticeably fuller. After two years, it&#x27;s really visible. My sister who was visiting noticed it right away, so she ordered some. It is pricey, but worth it. It feels and smells wonderful, too. Again, it&#x27;s not overnight, and you will not get Angelina Jolie lips; but yours will get smoother, fuller, and the color will come back! Yeah!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost two years. I love it, and have gotten all of my friends and family to use it also. I have every color, though the natural is probably my \\&quot;daily driver\\&quot;. It is not a quick fix, but rather a daily treatment that really does give your lips a little \\&quot;oopmh\\&quot; over time, while also making them smooth and protecting them from the sun. Little tip: I use the clear as a primer to my red, matte lipsticks. It makes them go on so much smoother! Can&#x27;t wait to try their new glosses.</li>
    <li> Loving my Kaplan MD Lip 20 Treatment Gloss! It glides on so smooth and leaves my lips feeling soft and moisturized. Unlike other glosses that I have tried, this one isn&#x27;t even a bit sticky and has a very natural looking shine rather than that high gloss look. I love the little mirror on the top of the tube, great for checking applications on the go. I got the Velvet Wine Sparkle [[ASIN:B004VR1HN2 Kaplan MD Lip 20 Treatment Gloss, Wine Sparkle, 0.13 Ounce]] and the name couldn&#x27;t be more perfect. It is a lovely shade of wine (not too dark) with just a hint of sparkle. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Completely worth the price. I&#x27;ve been looking for years to replace my old favorite from Benefit that they discontinued.  Leaves my lips soft and full looking. Great packaging, No cap to lose.</li>
    <li> This is the first lipstick I have used that does NOT chap my lips.  The colors are sheer and natural, and I reapply about 3 times during the day without having to put liip balm under it.  Thank you Kaplan MD.</li>

    <li> Quick shipment!  I love this lipstick with the built in moisturizer.  I first purchased it at a spa and was so excited to find it on Amazon!  Berry is just the right amount of color!</li>
    <li> Maybe my expectations were too high--but this \\&quot;plumping, moisturizing\\&quot; lip treatment merely lightened my wallet (a lot!).  And, it smears outside my lip liner. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> The hull looks so elegant,  you can use it with one hand.  It is very good for in the tropics.</li>
    <li> This arrived with the tip squashed.  I kept it, but do not care for it.  It&#x27;s not easy to apply and would not be good enough to buy again.</li>
    <li> This is great if you are looking for a lip balm.  It doesn&#x27;t show any color on the lip as far as I can tell.  Great packaging and love the twist off cap.</li>
    <li> This feels okay on my lips, and I appreciate the SPF 20, but the color was too flat, too matte--not attractive at all (I ordered the Berry). Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Just got and using today.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend. It goes on much lighter than it appears in the tube. I use this lip treatment exclusively and hope she&#x27;ll let me know how she likes it. When she does I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
    <li> Best lipstick I have ever purchased/used.</li>
    <li> I bought this lipstick in Sheer Berry last year and absolutely LOVED it!  But when I reordered recently, it was a completely different shade.  It&#x27;s still labeled the same but no where near as pink as the original.  When a manufacturer changes the color, they should let you know.  This is way too expensive to buy and not use.</li>
    <li> I have used this and have noticed absolutely nothing outstanding about it.  I don&#x27;t understand the rave reviews.  Doesn&#x27;t feel all that great on your lips...doesn&#x27;t stay on any better than any other balm, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my lips being fuller, softer, etc.... The cost of this pretty little silver container isn&#x27;t worth it.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite lipstick! It has lasted all year and really keeps my lips healthy year round! This color is perfect!</li>
    <li> MLBB shade. Slight plumping action. Lasts a decent amount of time and wears off evenly, What&#x27;s not to love! The price point may be a bit higher than some but worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it has sunscreen in it as I have very fair skin.  Hope they come out with even more colors!</li>
