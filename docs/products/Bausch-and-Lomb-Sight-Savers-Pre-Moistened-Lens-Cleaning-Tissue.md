      <li>Anyone who has glasses, reading glasses, or sunglasses will love this product.  </li>

      <li>I have tried similar lens cleaners but these are the best.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I bought these to use on my prescription sunglasses and glasses, but have used them on so much more.  </li>

      <li>Got similar product at work decieded to get some for home use very happy with these</li>
      <li>so I purchased more.</li>
      <li>Love these wipes.</li>
      <li>Just remember to keep a cleaning cloth with you. :)</li>
      <li>so I thought I would try the B&amp;L version which had even better reviews than the PDI brand.  </li>
      <li>The PDI tissues worked better at cleaning my glasses</li>
      <li>Great to have around to clean your glasses the right way.</li>
      <li>Your glasses dry perfectly.  </li>
      <li>It leaves the screen streak-free and clean!</li>
      <li>and they are quite possibly the best thing to clean your glasses with.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; lens wipes, but they&#x27;re perfectly good at what they do.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, fast and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Love these to clean lens and computer screens</li>
      <li>Top notch item to clean your classes.  </li>
      <li>The fact that the tissues come in individual packages is great as well.</li>
      <li>These work very well and are handy.  </li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and comes in easy to use package.</li>
      <li>I also use it to clean my phone, ipad, and Kindle of swipe marks.  </li>
      <li>it clean and streak</li>
      <li>These are great though sometimes too wet.  </li>
      <li>The product is probably as good as you can find for lens wipes though and the single packets work</li>
      <li>New packaging, same great product.  </li>
      <li>They are so handy being in individual packs!</li>
      <li>I use this for both optical and safety wear in the plant and for my own personal glasses.  </li>
      <li>It is the only kind of cleaner I use for my eyeglasses.</li>
      <li>Bought a box back in March; liked the product then</li>
      <li>They are a lot more convenient to carry around then a little spray bottle and they clean much better than tissues and water.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are easy to open and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Very travel friendly</li>
      <li>The tissues really gets the items clean.</li>
      <li>These are simply the best cleaning products on the market for cleaning eye glasses, hands down.  </li>
      <li>I have been using these for the last six months and love them.</li>
      <li>This is not the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product.  </li>
      <li>One of the advantages to me was I could use the same tissue on more than one pair of glasses or screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It keeps them clean and clear.</li>
      <li>They are individually wrapped and provide just the right amount of moisture/cleaner to clean your glasses, frames, and nose clips (if you like) without streaking.  </li>
      <li>Rarely are there any smears and if there are a quick second wipe does the job.</li>
      <li>Works very well  .</li>
      <li>about 10 cents apiece, I think they are reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>product at reasonable price.</li>
      <li>But these are very convenient to take in my purse and have them throughout the house.  </li>
      <li>Okay, but extremely wet.  </li>
      <li>VERY WELL,</li>
      <li>These work very well.</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s more expensive per unit than most others, it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
      <li>They also come in handy at a movie theatre when, as the film started, I realized the 3D glasses I&#x27;ve been handed had a big fingerprint in the middle of the lens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is by far the best, not only due to the high quality, streak-free cleaning, but because it is dispensed in individuallye-wrapped packets which prevents drying out - especially in the south where it&#x27;s hot.</li>
      <li>The first brand was PDI&#x27;s See Clear</li>
      <li>They are compact, easy to carry, well sealed, extremely moist, and large when unfolded.  </li>
      <li>Leaves lines on my glasses, I have to take a dry cloth to clean my glasses after I have &amp;#34;cleaned&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>When I bought them the this time, I noticed the new packaging.  </li>
      <li>® Quick Dry Eyeglass Cleaning Wipes which I also bought on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>and they make my glasses crystal clear.  </li>
      <li>I do spend money on mini-luxuries, but if one prefers to use the old fashioned method of soap and water, why not.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not worth spending the money. More than half of the cleaners are dry and therefore unusable.</li>
    <li> I like these lens wipes, but they often leave marks on my glasses because they are quite wet.</li>
    <li> Great product and on-time delivery!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I use them all the time on my glasses, cell phone, and computer screen. I always have one in my purse.</li>
    <li> Like them the best, but had to find B&amp;L retail.</li>
    <li> Top notch item to clean your classes.  We also use it on our Pads, cell phones and LCD screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets it clean and streak free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> These are great for cleaning glasses, computer screens and cell phone screens absolutely no streaks left behind I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> My previous employer supplied these in the shop, after I left I missed the convenience of them. They work great!</li>
    <li> New packaging, same great product.  I use this for both optical and safety wear in the plant and for my own personal glasses.  Even though it&#x27;s more expensive per unit than most others, it&#x27;s worth the money.  Breaks down organic grease very well, along with regular cleaning.  I never get &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; wipes and wipes have plenty of solution to prevent scratching.  Tip-Remember to wipe a second time, after the cloth has dried a little to prevent streaking.</li>
    <li> Item is as described. Works great! Shipped quickly and comes in easy to use package. Great for any kind of glasses!</li>
    <li> Leaves lines on my glasses, I have to take a dry cloth to clean my glasses after I have &amp;#34;cleaned&amp;#34; my glasses with these.</li>
    <li> Good amount of moisture in each cleaning pad. Pre- moistured pads do a great job on eyeglasses and IPhone and IPad screens</li>
    <li> We use this product at home, in the car, at work and my wife carries them in her purse. Great product</li>
    <li> Got similar product at work decieded to get some for home use very happy with these they make cleaning glass surfaces of things very easy , like glasses,computers, t.v.,etc.</li>
    <li> This box does not contain the dry glass cleaner wipes, only the wet ones, so you still have to have a cloth to dry the glasses.  Not very helpful for cleaning glasses.  My husband won&#x27;t use them.  Mostly, they are are still in the box, unused.</li>
    <li> No smear and not so damp the drying time becomes an issue</li>
    <li> This is nothing more than an alcohol-soaked piece of a non-soft, paperish product.&lt;br /&gt;It smears and does not do a good job at all.</li>
    <li> I hate dirty glasses, especially when I&#x27;m driving or watching TV.  These work very well and are handy.  I always keep some in the car, at work, and in the bathroom cupboard.  They are a lot more convenient to carry around then a little spray bottle and they clean much better than tissues and water.  They also come in handy at a movie theatre when, as the film started, I realized the 3D glasses I&#x27;ve been handed had a big fingerprint in the middle of the lens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how she does it but my daughter manages to always get her glasses dirty with fingerprints and who know what else she managed to get on them.  They do a great job a cleaning even the filthiest lenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At about 10 cents apiece, I think they are reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased several boxes of these over the last few years and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Our glasses always get dirty and this product works great, getting them cleaned and ready to wear in a few seconds.</li>
    <li> Good product, glasses get smudged often.  other products come with inferior wrapping and the tissues dry out.  Not so with this product.  They do not scratch your lens either.  Like them and use them often.</li>
    <li> These are great though sometimes too wet.  Sometimes leave streaks and I have to re-clean my glasses.  Tried on my computer screen and it did not clean the screen well.  But these are very convenient to take in my purse and have them throughout the house.  I will buy again</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wears glasses.  They are efficient and don&#x27;t scratch one&#x27;s glasses.  I keep some in the car and next to my recliner where, maybe because I&#x27;m at rest, I begin to notice that my glasses need cleaning and B &amp; L are handy.  Also keep some in my purse.  I&#x27;ve gone through several boxes this size and when I share with my friends, they like them, too.  I do spend money on mini-luxuries, but if one prefers to use the old fashioned method of soap and water, why not.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and this is perfect for taking on the road.  I&#x27;ve used several competing lens cleaners.  All have their issues.  This is by far the best product I have ever used.  They are compact, easy to carry, well sealed, extremely moist, and large when unfolded.  I will be back.</li>
    <li> These are great! They are so handy being in individual packs! I plan to order more soon! The best price I have found is on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love these wipes. Super handy! Cleans my eye and sunglasses and I use on all my technology.  I have them in my purse, desk drawer and in my car!</li>
    <li> My only quibble with these lens cleaners is that there is a little to much moisture which is way better than too little.</li>
    <li> I have used this since being referred to Amazon to buy it. I use one every day on my eyeglasses. It keeps them clean and clear. Great for travel put one in your purse daily. An excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have tried similar lens cleaners but these are the best.  I won&#x27;t try any others again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good good good</li>
    <li> For anyone with glasses, buy a couple boxes of these.  You will find yourself sharing with family and friends, and keeping some in your car, purse, or pocket.  Anyone who has glasses, reading glasses, or sunglasses will love this product.  I also use it to clean my phone, ipad, and Kindle of swipe marks.  Buy a box, you will love them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bausch and Lomb sight savers for many years and were a 5 star product.  When I bought them the this time, I noticed the new packaging.  Since the new packaging, the wipes are not consistently moist.  Several times I&#x27;ve taken one from the box and found the wipe too dry to use on my glasses.  I bought 4 boxes and all 4 boxes have the same inconsistency.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product at work, where we were supplied cleaning products for our safety gear (glasses).  I now purchase them for my family glasses.  These are simply the best cleaning products on the market for cleaning eye glasses, hands down.  They are individually wrapped and provide just the right amount of moisture/cleaner to clean your glasses, frames, and nose clips (if you like) without streaking.  Your glasses dry perfectly.  I also use them for my laptop screen - no streaking!</li>
    <li> They arrived too dry and definitely not &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34;  This is not the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product.  Not happy</li>
    <li> LCLEAN GLASSES VERY WELL, BUT DON&#x27;T ORDER MORE THAN 2 BOXES AT A TI ME</li>
    <li> Works very well  . Very travel friendly</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; lens wipes, but they&#x27;re perfectly good at what they do.</li>
    <li> Love these to clean lens and computer screens</li>
    <li> All towelettes were dried out when I received them, buy them elsewhere.</li>
    <li> These wipes work well at cleaning off the lenses of my glasses.  They dont leave any streaks or anything and they make my glasses crystal clear.  The one thing I will tell you is after you wipe your glasses there are wet beads that always remain on your lenses from the wipe so you will need a microfiber cloth or something of that sort to dry them and as long as you use a dry wipe that doesn&#x27;t leave any residue you will end up with crystal clear lenses. The product is probably as good as you can find for lens wipes though and the single packets work well so you dont end up with dried out wipes. Good product.</li>
    <li> They clean great, but I was a little disappointed that after I wipe down my lenses that I still need to use a cloth to clean off the excess.  It leaves streaks and if you don&#x27;t wipe the lens off it will leave a dry streak.  So, if you are looking for instant cleaner without carrying around a little spray bottle, I highly recommend.  Just remember to keep a cleaning cloth with you. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using these for the last six months and love them. They do an excellent job of cleaning my glasses. Rarely are there any smears and if there are a quick second wipe does the job. The fact that the tissues come in individual packages is great as well. I keep a bunch at work and some at home. It saves spraying and wiping or having a larger container of wipes.</li>
    <li> Great to have around to clean your glasses the right way.</li>
    <li> The Bausch &amp; Lomb tissues are really nice sized and are good for keeping in your bag just for cleaning your glasses or the screen on your phone/tablet/laptop. It leaves the screen streak-free and clean! It&#x27;s a great product to keep around just for a quick cleaning!</li>
    <li> We have tried most lense cleaning products on the market.  This is by far the best, not only due to the high quality, streak-free cleaning, but because it is dispensed in individuallye-wrapped packets which prevents drying out - especially in the south where it&#x27;s hot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bausch and Lomb Sight Savers for practically eons and have always been very pleased with them and carry them wherever I go to keep my glasses clean. Plus they keep for a long time so if I haven&#x27;t used the entire large box within a year or two I have no concerns about whether they will dry out.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use on my prescription sunglasses and glasses, but have used them on so much more.  I use them on my iPad and my kids idevices.  The tissues really gets the items clean.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these several times. Cleans my glasses, my phone and my Kindle.  My husband uses them too. No complaints.</li>
    <li> These work very well. It is the only kind of cleaner I use for my eyeglasses.</li>
    <li> I love it hope I can keep getting this item from amazon. Even my Girl is taking them from me.</li>
    <li> They are not the same as a few years ago. They are to wet leave spots on the glasses for me</li>
    <li> This is a good product, fast and easy to use. They dry out fast so when you open them, time to get busy.</li>
    <li> Bought a box back in March; liked the product then so I purchased more. Easier to carry than a small glasses-cleaner bottle of some solution/small cloth.  Disposable aspect is great.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Best I have used yet waybetterthan that http://www.amazon.com/Zeiss-Pre-Moistened-Lens-Cloths-Wipes/dp/B0030E4UIQ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1357864460&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;eyeglass+cleaner&lt;br /&gt;Zeiss brand. No dust or lint left on the lenses like the Zeiss brand.</li>
    <li> Great product, cleans well. Not overly wet like some! I like the way they dispense from the packaging, nice and easy!</li>
    <li> Great for taking along in the car or in your purse.</li>
    <li> Good buy and good product</li>
    <li> These wipes do the job but I don&#x27;t think they are the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;This is only the second brand of lens wipes I have bought, unfortunately they are the second best brand I have used.  The first brand was PDI&#x27;s See Clear® Quick Dry Eyeglass Cleaning Wipes which I also bought on Amazon.  They were not available in the size box I wanted when I needed to restock so I thought I would try the B&amp;L version which had even better reviews than the PDI brand.  Here is my experience with the 2 wipes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The B&amp;L tissues are wetter than the PDI, that in itself is not good or bad but I can see some people may have a preference.  One of the advantages to me was I could use the same tissue on more than one pair of glasses or screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The B&amp;L wipes had a stronger alcohol type smell then the PDI wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packets were the same size but the B&amp;L packets were a little easier to get into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the biggest difference was that the B&amp;L tissues didn&#x27;t always do a good job of cleaning my glasses. They sometimes leave a haze that did not clear when they dried.  The PDI tissues worked better at cleaning my glasses consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if there is a lot of variation between different batches of the same product, I only have a few hundred wipes to base my experience on but the next time I will buy the PDI brand.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear glasses but I do wear my Costa&#x27;s on a daily basis.  I use these wipes several times a week and they are quite possibly the best thing to clean your glasses with.  We go boating almost every weekend and they work well getting sunscreen overspray off as well as grease smudges.  The 100 pack lasted my wife and I just over a year and I even give quite a few of these away to others to try because I think they work so well.</li>
    <li> Thankfully I don&#x27;t have to use too often.&lt;br /&gt;But whenever I need it, it works.&lt;br /&gt;Good product at reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Okay, but extremely wet.  Need to dry lenses after using.  Not what I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different brands and these are by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to open and easy to use.</li>
