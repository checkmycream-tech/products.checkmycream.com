      <li>Super easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The lotion itself is pretty good, and I don&#x27;t need a lot at all for my whole body.</li>

      <li>And I really like that the company doesn&#x27;t do animal testing!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It is not at all greasy and soaks into the skin fast!</li>
      <li>Will definitely get more when I run out.</li>
      <li>and I take a hot bath every night to soak my sore muscles.  </li>
      <li>As a native of Phoenix, AZ I&#x27;ve been out in the sun for pretty much all my life.</li>
      <li>I really like this spray.</li>
      <li>Very watery.</li>
      <li>As it turns out, squeezing and pouring a bottle of lotion is just too much work for me.</li>
      <li>I really do like the lotion, though, so</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and I am anxious to try another scent.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and covers a wide area with one pass.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend buying it  </li>
      <li>She suggested getting a lotion with high concentration Vitamin C-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, smells divine, absorbs quickly and really fights dry skin, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;Pricey&amp;#34; $$$$$.</li>
      <li>Its ok, not moisturizing enough for my dry skin.</li>

      <li>ill get on floor , fair</li>
      <li>The can is pretty light, so I&#x27;m not sure if it will last a long time, but when I need it, it gets the job done!  </li>
      <li>I thought I was safe with the picture of the grapefruit on it, but good grief, avoid the &amp;#34;Energizing SH*TRUS&amp;#34; scent at all costs!  </li>
      <li>Smells good, but im afraid</li>
      <li>Most lotions are too thick and make me feel sticky and sweaty all day long.</li>

<li> Spray pattern is pretty tight, so unless you have the DTs or something, you shouldn&#x27;t hose down your bathroom at all.  </li>
<li> Leaves you feeling all soft with only a subtle fragrance.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not sticky or oily and it keeps me from getting tight, dry skin overnight.  </li>
<li> I can either rub it around a little or just leave it as is.  </li>
<li> Big waste!!!</li>
<li> I had been seeing these spray lotions for a few weeks now.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s plenty of product trapped inside after a week of use.</li>
<li> The scent is a bit much at first, but once you rub it in, it is not so bad.</li>
<li> I am SO lazy.</li>
<li> Then again, I&#x27;m the one that&#x27;s too lazy to tilt and squeeze a bottle of lotion...</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It stopped spraying right away. There&#x27;s plenty of product trapped inside after a week of use. I rinsed and scrubbed the nozzle but the way it just fizzled out reminded me of that happening before with something similar.</li>
    <li> I like it smells good and Works as Well !</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. You dont need to ask someone to put cream on your back ..just spray.&lt;br /&gt;I use it right out of the shower. Legs, arms where ever. The citrus is the only one I have tried and it is nice.</li>
    <li> Smells good, not very hydrating on the skin</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it on my back.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. Left me feeling sticky and the scent was off.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a great job of super moisturizing my skin but does provide a light coating. It&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
    <li> I love the refreshing feeling that is not greasy. I found it here before it was offered in the stores.</li>
    <li> I had been seeing these spray lotions for a few weeks now. I am a lotion fein but hate getting my hands greasy. I like fun fruity scents so I chose this one and it smells wonderful and makes my skin so soft. Will never buy regular motion ever again!!</li>
    <li> I have the Citrus &amp; Vitamin C lotion spray. It smells like a public restroom!! The lotion itself is pretty good, and I don&#x27;t need a lot at all for my whole body. But I just can&#x27;t get over the scent. It smells like covered up poop! Blehhh!! I really do like the lotion, though, so I may try the coconut milk fragrance the next time I buy some.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel. Really easy to use.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!!! (My favorite part) Great size for the price and seems to be working! Will definitely get more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love the ease of this spray.  It is not for when you are super dry, but perfect for me after I get out of the shower for a quick spray-down.  The scent is a bit much at first, but once you rub it in, it is not so bad.</li>
    <li> I have to put some sort of moisturizer on every time I bathe and I take a hot bath every night to soak my sore muscles.  When I get out of the tub, sometimes I am just too sleepy to want to apply lotion or oil all over.  When this happens, I reach for the St. Ives spray lotion.  It goes on easily and covers a wide area with one pass.  I can either rub it around a little or just leave it as is.  It&#x27;s not sticky or oily and it keeps me from getting tight, dry skin overnight.  The can is pretty light, so I&#x27;m not sure if it will last a long time, but when I need it, it gets the job done!  And I really like that the company doesn&#x27;t do animal testing!</li>
    <li> This lotion is ok.  The smell is not my favorite and not what I expected but it feels pretty good on my skin.</li>

    <li> I am so happy for easy to use products like this one.  You can spray and go and your skin is moisturized and smooth in a jiffy.  The smell is nice and I am anxious to try another scent.</li>
    <li> Liked the cocoa butter Vaseline version, this did NOT smell like citrus to me, sweet and tropical. buy this if you like very sweet smelling scents</li>
    <li> I love this lotion spray! It smells great and is super convenient to use on the go. I used to always forget to put on lotion, but this spray helps keep my skin smelling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Most lotions are too thick and make me feel sticky and sweaty all day long. Not the St Ives Fresh Hydration spray! It&#x27;s light and goes on evenly. The scent isnt really citrus in my opinion, but its very pleasant.  My skin feels moisturized and not suffocated at all.  I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Love how this smells, sprays evenly on have even caught my husband using it I highly recommend buying it  will purchase again</li>
    <li> Very watery. Very thin. I used the citrus fragrance for the first time today and was very disappointed! 2 hours later you couldnt tell I even used lotion. Big waste!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff, love spray on lotion - works great! Not greasy at all. Goes on and drys quickly. Leaves you feeling all soft with only a subtle fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, very refreshing.  Easy to use and apply!  This is fun to use in the morning and provides a nice scent.</li>

    <li> The only way I can put lotion in the morning, practical fast and smell sooooo good! Leave skin soft and hydrate</li>
    <li> I really like this spray. It&#x27;s easy to apply and really helps keep my skin moisturized in this never-ending Winter we&#x27;re having in PA this year.</li>
    <li> The bottle clogs and does not spray.</li>
    <li> Nice clean mild scent and easy to use</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s not greasy, smells divine, absorbs quickly and really fights dry skin, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;Pricey&amp;#34; $$$$$.</li>
    <li> As a native of Phoenix, AZ I&#x27;ve been out in the sun for pretty much all my life. As a current middle aged health conscious dude, I get my skin checked yearly for possible cancer.... my dermatologist advised me I have &#x27;pre-cancerous&#x27; traits on arms, nose and ears. She suggested getting a lotion with high concentration Vitamin C- &#x27;it will repair &amp; reverse the sun damage&#x27; is the reason behind her thoughts. I absolutely love this lotion!!! It sprays on&#x3D; awesome. It is not too heavy or greasy&#x3D; awesome. I fully believe you will be really happy with this product, try it!</li>
    <li> I am SO lazy. Seriously. As it turns out, squeezing and pouring a bottle of lotion is just too much work for me. I look at a bottle of lotion on my counter and just keep on walking. Nope, not today. My skin will have to suffer. This stuff though...is AWESOME!!! It&#x27;s the equivalent of spray on sunblock. SO EASY!! Just spray all over and rub in. Can&#x27;t be easier than that. This is the first winter in YEARS that my skin is not incredibly dry. I&#x27;m SO happy I finally gave this a try. I LOVE the scent too. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s quite &amp;#34;energizing&amp;#34;, but it does smell great. Then again, I&#x27;m the one that&#x27;s too lazy to tilt and squeeze a bottle of lotion...</li>
    <li> Its ok, not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. Smells good, but im afraid ill get on floor , fair</li>
    <li> Nice, fresh scent.  Spray is perfect for a light application.  Lotion absorbs well without feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Light and fresh..Love it!</li>
    <li> Great spray lotion but nozzle clogs quickly and sprays a stream</li>
    <li> I thought I was safe with the picture of the grapefruit on it, but good grief, avoid the &amp;#34;Energizing SH*TRUS&amp;#34; scent at all costs!  Absolutely, positively, amazingly TOILET-Y.  Like one of those things you clip on the rim of your crapper.  I almost took a shower again to get it off!  The product itself is excellent, feels nice and light and not like you dunked yourself in Crisco.  Super easy to use.  Spray pattern is pretty tight, so unless you have the DTs or something, you shouldn&#x27;t hose down your bathroom at all.  I bought this locally, so I hope I can exchange it for a better scent!</li>
    <li> My daughter likes this, so I have to take her word for it.  She says it is a great lotion and she uses daily.  If she is happy, I am too then.</li>
    <li> Smells so good. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a very light and airy feel to it. It is not at all greasy and soaks into the skin fast!</li>
    <li> I sprayed on one arm and compared the two an hour later and there was no difference.  It was like spraying fragrance water.</li>
    <li> light citrus scent, fine mist, that feels light on the skin, absorbs quickly, yet moisturizes well, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
