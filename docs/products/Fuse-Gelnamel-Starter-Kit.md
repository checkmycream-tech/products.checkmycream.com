      <li>Great product and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I applied two coats for better coverage as directed in instructions.</li>
      <li>: do not get it on your skin, (because it won&#x27;t be sealed, &amp; it&#x27;ll burn you a lil&#x27;, when curing,) and, as they do instruct, make sure to get the front and side edges.</li>
      <li>I also needed two coats instead of just one, and after I was done they looked okay</li>
      <li>if there&#x27;s moisture under, (or on top and not finished/sealed,)</li>

      <li>and I love it</li>

      <li>I wish they carried more colors</li>
      <li>Works better</li>

      <li>and that one cost more, took 3x longer to &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; my nail polish... and blasting my hands with UV rays always concerned</li>
      <li>and I was in love.  </li>
      <li>Like deeper shades better.</li>
      <li>i had more time i would have written less&amp;#34;)&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far I have a beautiful shiny finish that still looks like it was just done.</li>
      <li>It was easy to do and it looks lovely.</li>
      <li>so they are fresh and nice while I travel.  </li>
      <li>my 2cents &amp; 42tips:&lt;br /&gt;i really think that maybe it just takes some practice/experimentation and patience to get good results doing gels on yourself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>you would think that Sensationails would be able to come up with a one-step formula to use with their original Pro 3060 LED Lamp.</li>
      <li>Great product but B sure to file top of nail, use cleaner, one even coat and dry 2 sessions then wipe with cleaner.  </li>
      <li>and then luckily I was able to return it.</li>
      <li>Two weeks of chip free teaching science classes, gardening, dog wrestling, dish washing and housework.  </li>
      <li>wipe with lint free “</li>
      <li>Light comes with a plug.</li>
      <li>in Fuse light for one push button timer.</li>
      <li>( the Fuse light works for toes</li>
      <li>, mine fit in</li>
      <li>but you can alter the light for toes too.</li>
      <li>rad.&lt;br /&gt;last test is to see if my friend who&#x27;s allergic to the sun/UV rays, so can not get gel manis done, because the UV light burns/hurts/leaves a rash on her...</li>
      <li>(for MORE than it&#x27;s being listed for here on good ol&#x27; amazon, btw,) was this lil&#x27; FUZE kit.&lt;br /&gt;looked to be by the same company &amp; the bottles of polish</li>
      <li>If you read the directions and follow them exactly, you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems!!</li>
      <li>Totally worth it though!  </li>
      <li>As for the curing process, be ready as it feels like you tapped your nail on a hot curling iron for a split second when the led light starts fuzing it, lol!</li>
      <li>Can do most anywhere fast and portable.  </li>
      <li>I gave it three stars because the color is true to what it looks like in the bottle no matter what shade you pick.</li>
      <li>/&gt;ok- more specifics of my 5 stars:&lt;br /&gt;i love that it&#x27;s only 30 seconds to finish!!!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>far every other brand of gel polish &amp; all their add-ons,  works perfectly well in combo with this.&lt;br /&gt;THAT</li>
      <li>(maybe the many layers i usually use is also why i get good results...</li>
      <li>Now i can do my nails and they still look pretty in two weeks!</li>
      <li>Great little treat.</li>
      <li>as with any beauty treatment you&#x27;re doing on yourself at home with a pro or non-pro product/procedure, you must learn the proper techniques; there&#x27;s many fine details that pros know &amp; do (every day, nonstop, for hundreds of hours)</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Na-No Way&amp;#34; pink shade takes about two coats and it&#x27;s gorgeous as well.</li>
      <li>though i think it&#x27;s totally worth it, since getting what i want at a nail salon ends up over $100!!&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>The light pink color looked pretty in the bottle, but on application was streaky and a kind of gloppy.</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions exactly, it works perfect and you will have a strong, vibrant, gel manicure that last two weeks and looks brand new til the last day!</li>
      <li>As time went on more brands became available to consumers including the same product used in many of the Asian nail shops.  </li>
      <li>really!</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly per the instructions.  </li>
      <li>and it still looks exactly like when I finished putting it on.</li>
      <li>The polish is a combo of gritty and goofy.  </li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still really pretty and glittery.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully, they will come up with a better formulation in the future.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would say is make sure you don&#x27;t get any on your skin or cuticles because it will harden and peel.  </li>
      <li>, notice how important it is to use acetone/alcohol before &amp; ESPECIALLY after, &amp; to clean the edges, &amp; to leave empty space between your nail and your cuticle, because the gel kinda spreads/smoothes out in the &amp;#34;oven.&amp;#34; ...lots of little quick &amp; easy steps are pertinent to getting great results... &amp; if you don&#x27;t do &#x27;em, you&#x27;re screwed.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; polish is more like an industrial ceramic enamel, (rather than merely paint,) ...&lt;</li>
      <li>I really am won over with this product.</li>
      <li>a car, (or anything, really,)</li>
      <li>so much I bought one for my mom.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to like this stuff, I really did.</li>
      <li>Whole kit.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I really buffed my nails a lot and followed the directions to a T.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this.  </li>
      <li>fast forward a month or so</li>
      <li>I use straight acetone to take all the oils off my fingernails, then I buff/etch the surface of my nail really well.</li>
      <li>i really like the ONE nail at a time concept.</li>
      <li>(&amp; i think it&#x27;s better to zap an extra time if you feel like it, &#x27;cause &#x27;tis better to be sure it&#x27;s done than to be sorry, later.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I love this for quick manis that dry instantly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the nail polish clips the same, awful.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Peeled off in less than a day</li>
    <li> Bought at wal-mart today for $12.98 . Whole kit. Single polish is $5.98. Neither on sale. Just regular price. Works better the the CND shellac I used in Cosmo school. Goes on nicely. Not to thick. 30 seconds per finger. Wipe off the inhibition layer and PRESTO!Feels good. Nice shine. Light comes with a plug. Great little treat.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this.  I have never tried gel nail polish before and followed the (extensive) instructions to the tee. It dried within 30 seconds under the little lamp just like it said,  but by the next day I had chips and then whole nails peeled off. Even the polish by itself (without the starter kit) is expensive.  I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit along with some of there other colors. I used the color intens-so-fly and I love it this is the 3rd day of wear and it still looks exactly like when I finished putting it on. I really buffed my nails a lot and followed the directions to a T. I am really happy with this kit. No chipping yet and that&#x27;s with my 8 month old son chewing on my fingers here and there. I look forward to trying out the color that is shown here that came with the kit and hopefully I will have no problems! Remember to follow the steps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. buff and then cleanse&lt;br /&gt;2. apply thin coat and put under led light&lt;br /&gt;3 apply another thin coat and put under light (can repeat until you reach the desired thickness but you have to put under lap between each coat.)&lt;br /&gt;4 after you have put the final coat on then cleanse! and you are done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put 2-3 coats on each nail and the cleanser I believe is just rubbing alcohol, so I will try that when I run out of the &amp;#34;cleanse&amp;#34; and see if it works to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I am basing this review and my results off of having little to no experience painting my nails especially with any gel type polishes. Usually I paint my nails and they chip within hours. I tried a brand of &amp;#34;gel effect&amp;#34; polish from sephora that was by nails inc, cost me $15 dollars and started chipping the next day. This was cheaper and the results last longer.</li>
    <li> I personally love this kit! I bought it when I was having my son 7 months ago and it was awesome and so easy to take to the hospital. You have to keep in mind gel must be applied very thin and only to the nail none on the skin. I wish they carried more colors but I love this for quick manis that dry instantly. Takes about 30 min to do all 10 nails and they are each dry as soon as you are finished so it is really convienent for a mommy who may need to stop half way through. I recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I like mine so much I bought one for my mom.  I&#x27;ve never had gels done before so at this price I couldn&#x27;t resist trying it.  I followed the directions exactly per the instructions.  My nails came out rock hard and I am very rough with my hands and nails.  No chips or peeling.  The only thing I would say is make sure you don&#x27;t get any on your skin or cuticles because it will harden and peel.  Great product and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Wal-Mart. I followed the directions to the letter. I applied two coats for better coverage as directed in instructions. Within 4 hours the polish just peeled off 6 of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The light pink color looked pretty in the bottle, but on application was streaky and a kind of gloppy. I also needed two coats instead of just one, and after I was done they looked okay but for some reason not as pretty or high shine as the standard gel nails. However, my biggest issue was that the polish started to chip flake after only a day or two. I have had regular polish last longer so that was a huge disappointment. My regular gel nail polish usually lasts at least 10 to 14 days which for me is one of the main reasons of even using a gel nail polish versus a regular manicure- long wear. Having to cure one finger at a time is a bit tedious- you would think that Sensationails would be able to come up with a one-step formula to use with their original Pro 3060 LED Lamp. I was so unhappy I only used it once and then luckily I was able to return it. Hopefully, they will come up with a better formulation in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and followed application instructions. Extremely disappointing and I returned it the next day. The polish was not the color expected and was extremely goopy. It came out of the bottle in globs and was sticky even after curing. I cured it extra and it hardened but the polish began to peel in only hours. There are much better products out there for gel nails.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this stuff! If you read the directions and follow them exactly, you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems!! So glad I found this! Now i can do my nails and they still look pretty in two weeks! :) before I found this, I would paint my nails and the polish would already be chipping before the day was over!</li>
    <li> Perfect Nails. :O)&lt;br /&gt;Remove old polish.&lt;br /&gt;Wash hands.&lt;br /&gt;Lightly buff nails.&lt;br /&gt;Lightly wipe with lint free “Fuse Cleaner”&lt;br /&gt;Do one nail at a time, polish with Sensationail gel base coat.&lt;br /&gt;When doing finger nails, polish tip edge and just under edge.&lt;br /&gt;Put in Fuse light for one push button timer. (30 seconds) ( the Fuse light works for toes, mine fit in but you can alter the light for toes too. The directions are inside.&lt;br /&gt;Wipe with nail cleaner again.&lt;br /&gt;Your nails now have a clear gel base.&lt;br /&gt;Regular polish will adhere to this well.  If you use gel polish it can be hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Now finish with a clear coat.&lt;br /&gt;Your nail polish will stay and not chip!!!!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> my 2cents &amp; 42tips:&lt;br /&gt;i really think that maybe it just takes some practice/experimentation and patience to get good results doing gels on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;also, the instructions are not that explicit. (i&#x27;ve tested a bunch of systems and the instructions are *never* very thorough.) as with any beauty treatment you&#x27;re doing on yourself at home with a pro or non-pro product/procedure, you must learn the proper techniques; there&#x27;s many fine details that pros know &amp; do (every day, nonstop, for hundreds of hours) so of course it&#x27;s going to be a different experience, with different results, at least at first, when you DIY.&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;ve had gel nails done at a pro shop, notice how important it is to use acetone/alcohol before &amp; ESPECIALLY after, &amp; to clean the edges, &amp; to leave empty space between your nail and your cuticle, because the gel kinda spreads/smoothes out in the &amp;#34;oven.&amp;#34; ...lots of little quick &amp; easy steps are pertinent to getting great results... &amp; if you don&#x27;t do &#x27;em, you&#x27;re screwed.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; polish is more like an industrial ceramic enamel, (rather than merely paint,) ...&lt;br /&gt;&amp; it melts as it solidifies ~ which is why it can be a bit globby looking (even intentionally, as i do it, to build up and sorta sculpt a rounder looking nail bed,)~ before you cure it, but instantly smooths out in the oven. and like the paint of, oh, let&#x27;s say... a car, (or anything, really,) if there&#x27;s moisture under, (or on top and not finished/sealed,) it&#x27;ll be sticky... &amp;or chip or flake, or rather, as with my fingernails, just completely pop off...&lt;br /&gt;so: do not get it on your skin, (because it won&#x27;t be sealed, &amp; it&#x27;ll burn you a lil&#x27;, when curing,) and, as they do instruct, make sure to get the front and side edges. &amp; then (!!!!) get the moisture layer off after. *their stuff works! i just dribble a drop onto my finger, then rub/polish it around, (*though i *think* alcohol or non-acetone nailpolish remover,) and if i want, i&#x27;ll go for another coat of coloror clear (i usually do designs and add embellishments) (maybe the many layers i usually use is also why i get good results...?)&lt;br /&gt;(&amp; i think it&#x27;s better to zap an extra time if you feel like it, &#x27;cause &#x27;tis better to be sure it&#x27;s done than to be sorry, later.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok- more specifics of my 5 stars:&lt;br /&gt;i love that it&#x27;s only 30 seconds to finish!!!&lt;br /&gt;and that it&#x27;s a USB plug. &amp; small. (so i don&#x27;t fear it&#x27;ll be high voltage and explode like my UV one did.)&lt;br /&gt;and you can take the top off and just sorta shine it on wherever you want.&lt;br /&gt;&amp; one finger at a time is a great idea. perfect for an OCD/ADHD (HyperDetailed and perfectionistic)&lt;br /&gt;(...&amp; even though this FUZE (fuse?) stuff says you don&#x27;t need a base &amp; top coat, I do it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;which who knows? maybe that&#x27;s why i like this stuff: cause i DON&#x27;T follow directions. i always use my intuition from experience &amp; go overboard. . . as i know that, especially on version 1.0 of anything, the person writing the manual is not the person that invented the gizmo.)&lt;br /&gt; so yeah --  i really like the ONE nail at a time concept. it basically guarantees all my nails will be perfect, even if it takes me a week to do them, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my 1st UV curing lamp thingie recently basically exploded! (it surged and the power chord instantly melted off at the base of the unit! and that one cost more, took 3x longer to &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; my nail polish... and blasting my hands with UV rays always concerned me.&lt;br /&gt;i got that one through h4utelook... major discount, but still much more expensive and cumbersome than sensationail&#x27;s proucts.&lt;br /&gt;i first purchased the &#x27;regular&#x27; sensatioNail kit, along with some extra colors, at a drug store, at full price ($60!) though i think it&#x27;s totally worth it, since getting what i want at a nail salon ends up over $100!!&lt;br /&gt;but then i misplaced the LED thingie (it&#x27;s gotta be here somewhere! i just moved so ... well back to the point:)&lt;br /&gt;... so when i saw it was on sale for $40, i thought, &amp;#34;screw it. i&#x27;ll just get another.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;...THOUGH also on sale, (for MORE than it&#x27;s being listed for here on good ol&#x27; amazon, btw,) was this lil&#x27; FUZE kit.&lt;br /&gt;looked to be by the same company &amp; the bottles of polish are much bigger! &amp; it claimed to cure in half the time!...&lt;br /&gt;so i got BOTH, knowing i could return whatever, if i didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;well... fast forward a month or so, i haven&#x27;t even used the other sensationail lamp, but i have used the polishes and all other items, and i love that they are totally interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;and lastly, (did i say this already?... apologies, like mark twain said, &amp;#34;if i had more time i would have written less&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;so far every other brand of gel polish &amp; all their add-ons,  works perfectly well in combo with this.&lt;br /&gt;THAT is rad.&lt;br /&gt;last test is to see if my friend who&#x27;s allergic to the sun/UV rays, so can not get gel manis done, because the UV light burns/hurts/leaves a rash on her... so i still have to test the LED on her, (and will adjust the 5 stars down if necessary,)&lt;br /&gt;which is yet another reason i LOVE the design/concept of zapping one finger (or toe) at a time !!&lt;br /&gt;(though my toes are so little that i could shove 2 in at once :P)&lt;br /&gt;and the fact that it really only takes 30seconds (or a minute, in intervals,) ... makes it a lot less intimidating to try on my sensitive friend. ... &amp; in fact, use at all, when you really think about it ...&lt;br /&gt;...(as in WTF is this stuff?!... really! ~ though that&#x27;s not really something to get into when giving a positive review ;#)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have some pics somewhere that i sent my friend... don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s an option to upload, but if so, i will.&lt;br /&gt;cheers.</li>
    <li> Not even.....I have been a gel polish disciple for about three years now.  Prior to gel polish  I got acrylic put over my nails so that the polish would adhere to my nails for more than 24 hours.  I tired of the necessary fill every week or so and having my nails clipped down.  I&#x27;m pretty basic I like my nails short and red.  After hearing of gel polish I paid $45 dollars to have it done in a salon and I was in love.  Two weeks of chip free teaching science classes, gardening, dog wrestling, dish washing and housework.  I bought my own light and paid a premium for the CDC shellac polish on eBay.  As time went on more brands became available to consumers including the same product used in many of the Asian nail shops.  I have amassed quite the collection.  I travel quite a lot and so one of the last things I do in preparation is my nails so they are fresh and nice while I travel.  Because of the many steps involved it IS time consuming and I was looking for a shortcut , a product small enough the take with me in case I did not have time to do my nails before leaving......I thought this was it but no.  The polish is a combo of gritty and goofy.  It is horribly thick and does not self level.  In spite of three,thin coats the coverage is poor and uneven and after all of that it peels in a matter of hours. My nails looked so bad the day after I did them my husband asked me if I was out of &amp;#34; the gel polish&amp;#34;. I am amazed that this is a sensationail product. I think sensationail is an excellent product and quite reasonably priced.  I have gathered a hoard of my favorite color (raspberry wine) from the clearance shelves of Walmart and Walgreens but FUSE is crap that I re-Fuse to ever buy or use again.</li>
    <li> I applied it on Friday.  Today is Sunday (day 3) and now there is a little chipping off the tips of 5 of my nails.  I followed the instructions.  But I didn&#x27;t cap off the tips, maybe that helps and I will try that next time.  Also, the color is not like on the bottle.  I got the Gone Fission color, which on the bottle looks like a pale pink with iridescent glitter in it.  But actually it&#x27;s clear with tiny silver glitter, medium pink glitter, and a few pieces of larger iridescent glitter in it.  It&#x27;s still really pretty and glittery.  On the 1st nail I did too thick of a layer and it burned hot in the lamp but I learned that the burn goes away after about 5 seconds and it&#x27;s tolerable.  Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t feel chunky like regular glitter nail polish does.  It feels smoother.  With it chipping already, I doubt it will last 2 weeks.  Also, I used the same wipe for all 10 nails.  Maybe next time I will use 1 per hand.  I haven&#x27;t attempted to remove this stuff yet.  I wonder how that will go.</li>
    <li> This little kit is fantastic. You will get that beautiful high glossy shine in minutes that cost $20+ at the salon, for a fraction of the cost. If you follow the directions exactly, it works perfect and you will have a strong, vibrant, gel manicure that last two weeks and looks brand new til the last day! I really am won over with this product. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, because most products these days seem mediocre yet over priced..however with fuse gelnamel kit that&#x27;s not the case, very happily surprised.</li>
    <li> Tried this. Needed to do 3 coats for good color. After 10 minutes one nail peeled off! Not too happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great product but B sure to file top of nail, use cleaner, one even coat and dry 2 sessions then wipe with cleaner.  Can do most anywhere fast and portable.  Like deeper shades better.</li>
    <li> I have been doing my own nails with gel polish for about a year and I have tried various brands in drug stores and beauty supply stores.  I was drawn to Fuse because I was looking for a pretty red color for the holidays and they had one.  I was very skeptical of the &amp;#34;one coat&amp;#34; is all you need, but gave it a try and followed the directions exactly using just one thin coat.  They looked great when I was done and it has been a week and they still look exactly the same!</li>
    <li> Love love love this kit!  Works perfectly, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Horrible! I would not guess it&#x27;s by sensationail.  It is to thick, came out lumpy and I had a reaction..  Please don&#x27;t respond with instructions, I have been a manicurist since 1985.  My daughter&#x27;s peeled off the next day, mines on acrylic but will have to be removed since I got blisters from it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been one day since I put it on, but I do things with my hands at work and nail polish, even with topcoat, usually only lasts a few hours before the tips are chipped and worn down. So far I have a beautiful shiny finish that still looks like it was just done. It was easy to do and it looks lovely. This is an amazing deal.</li>
    <li> If you have any of the polish on your skin when you put it under the light it burns like crazy! The gel polish is not even close to what the bottle looks like! 😒</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this stuff, I really did. I paint my nails a lot but it&#x27;s always chipping off or messed up within hours. I spotted this and for the price decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s not that great. I followed the instructions exactly and the results were spotty. I needed to apply at least two coats of the polish before I got an opaque result. The instructions say that they might be dull after you cleanse your nail, but the shine should intensify with time. Mine never got that shiny and using the cleanser took color off even after curing it longer than the 30 seconds. It also says it&#x27;s self leveling and that if it&#x27;s streaky, wait a few seconds before curing. I did and still ended up with less than stellar results. The polish also looks thick. I know it&#x27;s a thicker formula, but my nails look thick and goopy. I also had a lot of bristles from the brush end up in my nail polish. I&#x27;ve tried using several different colors and always end up with the same results.  I gave it three stars because the color is true to what it looks like in the bottle no matter what shade you pick. The color options are nice too. From a distance, my nails looks good and the polish does last a little longer than regular polish (eg this lasted for about three days before peeling off).</li>
    <li> This product is rubbish peels off in a matter of minutes</li>
    <li> I paid 30 for this kit and painted my daughter and my own nails and the nail polish lasted a day or two before coming off in one piece. I followed directions exactly like the directions said and tried it a second time and the same thing happened. Do yourself a favor before buying this product just take 30 dollars and take it into your bathroom, throw it in the toilet and flush. Because if you buy this product that&#x27;s basicslly what you are doing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the other colors of this brand and they all look like the color in the bottle but this one is a shade darker than the bottle. I still like the color a lot. I haven&#x27;t had the issue with the gel peeling off, only when I tried one nail w/o prepping it just to c what it would look like. I use straight acetone to take all the oils off my fingernails, then I buff/etch the surface of my nail really well. My manicure lasts two weeks with this stuff on. I love it! &amp;#34;Watt&#x27;s Your color&amp;#34; is a pretty orangey red and you only need one coat with that one. The &amp;#34;Na-No Way&amp;#34; pink shade takes about two coats and it&#x27;s gorgeous as well. I think the folks that have problems with peeling need to probably buff their nails a little more so, I&#x27;ve never had any issues thus far with this kit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why someone said this was a streaky light pink, but when I got my starter kit, the bottle said it was clear with glitter. The glitter isn&#x27;t as pail as the bottle suggested but I ended up liking it. I&#x27;ve never had gel so this is all new to me. The polish itself was on the thick side but I found that if I let it sit for a sec before curing it, the stuff does level itself. Be careful, it&#x27;s easy to glop on a bit much and then the curing process requires a couple rounds. As for the curing process, be ready as it feels like you tapped your nail on a hot curling iron for a split second when the led light starts fuzing it, lol! It didnt exactly hurt but it was unpleasant, and only lasted a couple seconds. Totally worth it though!  Normally, regular polish chips within a day on me  and I end up peeling/chewing the rest off. (I do a lot of typing and equipment operation at a warehouse) but this polish just withstood a whole day on the keyboard and reach truck, and still looks great. I&#x27;ll have to try more colors...</li>
