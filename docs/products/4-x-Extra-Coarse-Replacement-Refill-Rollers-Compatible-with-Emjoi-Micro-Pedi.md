<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These did not work very well. Certainly did not work like the original ones that came with the unit...</li>
    <li> These worked great with my Emoji!! Like brand  new now!! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> My husband had very dry coarse skin on his heels and this extra coarse roller seems to work well to make his skin smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> replacements work great</li>
    <li> I bought this refill to use with Emjoi micro-pedi nano, it works well to remove the callus, only wish this can be clean with water otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good product.</li>
    <li> They work great. Fast service</li>
    <li> not very course for being extra course-</li>
    <li> Product dosent work as well as the ones that come with it originally. Dosent grid the same.</li>
    <li> The Body Source is a great place for ordering replacement rollers for the Emjoi Micro Pedi.  They work great at a cheaper cost than Emjoi refills.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great but the rollers only work maybe 4 times, ( I have dry cracked feet) so it&#x27;s good but I wish the rollers lasted longer</li>
    <li> These are to replace!  Love it emoji Mocro-pedi Nano Callus; it works great!</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with the results of this product.</li>
    <li> Over-priced emery board. In fact my girlfriend have better emery boards than this crap. The machine you put them in is a piece of ... don&#x27;t get me started, please. Just stick with handheld pumice stone. trust me.</li>
    <li> These are not genuine EMJOI refills even though they put the name in the title.  I missed the &amp;#34;Compatible&amp;#34; part.  For Extra Coarse, they were really lame.  Wore down quickly and didn&#x27;t really get my callouses down enough.</li>
    <li> I like this, it&#x27;s a good enough product though not quite strong enough to get all the rough skin and callouses off without sitting there forever. However, I was inspired by this product to get out my Black and Decker mouse sander to try on my feet instead and I have to report that that was EPIC. Will never go back. Baby smooth feet and a free massage thrown in.</li>
    <li> They work well for the unit!</li>
    <li> I like these really well. They are not cheaply made.  Does a great job.</li>
    <li> Excellent, got this and the super coarse and they work nicely when I alternate.</li>
    <li> love my Emjoi....and these are exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> I replaced the original roller effortlessly with this replacement roller.  Great price for the quantity.</li>
    <li> worked perfectly and I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t last very long, but still a great product.</li>
    <li> Good replacement for Emjoi-Pedi</li>
    <li> I have been using my micropedi with these rollers a couple times a week for about a month, and my feet are noticeable smoother.  They exfoliate dry skin quite well, although I still have a couple of tough calluses that I might try the &amp;#34;super coarse&amp;#34; rollers for.  Great product and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Extra coarse...NOT. Good for polishing off after using the extreme coarse set. But they are not extra coarse.</li>
    <li> I love this little callus shaver.  I purchased pink and blue rollers, but I&#x27;m unable to tell if they are the same courseness or different.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and works exactly like it should.</li>
    <li> Did not say micro -pedi on packaging; however, will fit the nano micro-pedi or hand-held micro pedi.&lt;br /&gt;They work and that is what one hopes for.</li>
    <li> Use these with the electric Emjoi.  They are replacements for the coarse ones included with the purchase of the sander.  They take care of heavier calluses.</li>
    <li> These replacement rollers make for clean and efficient work. Save yourself some time and skip the nail salon and save loads of cash.</li>
    <li> I have a spot on my right foot that is always rough. I am delight with my extra coarse micro mineral rollers.  I am so please with this that I am sending my daughter this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I do recommend this everybody who want to keep that feet smooth.  I have had [[ASIN:B00FO7TRMG 4 x Extra Coarse Micro Mineral Rollers Compatible with Emjoi Micro Pedi] for over a year now and wanted soon extra rollers.  It really does the job for me.  I really like it. The 4 extra coarse rollers  compatible with Emjoi were packaged well. I am just so happy with the results. There will be a repeat buy in the future for Emjoi Micro Pedic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s timely shipping schedule.  It could not have came any faster than Amazon&#x27;s shipping.  It is the best.</li>
    <li> Both product work for me. There is no refill at the store only here. I will continue to buy.. I gave 5 star</li>
    <li> I have had the product for a year. These are the replacement rollers for that product. This is the best product I have found for the feet.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I have sensitive feet and when I get a pedicure I have difficulty holding my foot still.  Also I dislike the rubbing and scraping the pedicurist does.  Since using the Micro Pedi, I no longer have to have that done when I get a pedicure. I was happy to find refills for the product and they work great!  I love the product and recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t seem to fit correctly and make a loud whining noise. They &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; but they are super loud</li>
    <li> did not fit well and chattered and vibrated</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t last long - lesson learned - buy refills by the original makers</li>
    <li> I love the Emjoi Micro Pedi - The Extra Coarse rollers are just right for feet that need to be cleaned up of tough skin and slight build up of callus.  I have used this about 4 times on my feet since I got it.  I will say that this is about as long as you will get out of the battery life.  Still I love the end result - my feet feel so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> The rollers are replacements for those included when you buy the Micro Pedi. However, they do not fit into the micro pedi properly and they make strange clicking noises and don&#x27;t really work as well as the original rollers that came with the machine that I bought.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if these are fakes or knock offs or something.</li>
    <li> Work fine with my unit.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clean!!</li>
    <li> I am glad that I ordered extra rollers, although the machine does a very thorough job. It is a good idea to have extras around.</li>
    <li> Although these don&#x27;t seem to have any more coarseness than the roller that came with my Micro Pedi I want to make sure I don&#x27;t run out. Very simple to change out and they really work.</li>
    <li> The micro pedi is a must for all women who want their heels to be smooth and beautiful.  These replacement rollers are a great deal and great price.</li>
    <li> Excellent value and cost less  than brand name - work exactly the same but better value. I bought 4 and am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> These refills work well.  Gentle but thorough removal of dead calloused skin.  Good price and I will buy them again when I finish with the ones I purchased.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were more at QVC . They were selling 2 for the  price of the the 4 I have bought different things at amazon that are better deals. When I need things like refills I&#x27;ll be shopping amazon.</li>
    <li> The coarse rollers did a great job on my feet.  I am on my feet most of the day so my feet produces calluses.  Theses rollers made my feet smooth and feel great.  I sometimes make a spa day for myself always using my Emjoi coarse rollers. I will definitely buy it again and recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Just don&#x27;t push, let it do the work. It did not heat up or slow down, but it sure polished off a lot of old calluses on both my feet and my wife&#x27;s. A great way to pamper each other.</li>
    <li> These work, but are slightly off.  When put in the unit they vibrate slightly, and make a funny noise.  Still work, but kind of annoying.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly in my micro pedi and are more economical to use. These rollers are great! Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Just like the ones that come with the Micro-Pedi.  Same size, color.  Why spend more when you don&#x27;t have to?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think they performed any differently than the ones shipped with my Micro Pedi, unlike other reviews.</li>
    <li> very good, great value A+++++++++</li>
    <li> These work really well to remove dead skin and calluses from feet in the micro-pedi unit.  The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is they&#x27;re so expensive!  Along with changing the sandpaper (that&#x27;s all these really are), be sure to change your battery enough, too - as that will decrease the efficiency of the unit and you can get more frustrated wasting time.  I will keep buying these, but will keep looking for less expensive refill options.</li>
    <li> I ordered a Micro Pedi from QVC.  It works great!  When I needed refills, I turned to Amazon and ordered the extra course refill rollers.  They work even better than the ones I received with the original Micro Pedi.  Keeps my heels nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> These were not to harsh, even though &amp;#34;extra coarse&amp;#34;. I think it cut down on time needed&lt;br /&gt;to smooth bunions, compared to the lesser coarse rollers.  Really think for tough callous,&lt;br /&gt;one could even go a step coarser, but with caution.</li>
    <li> This was the best price for 4 that I could find anywhere.  I highly recommend this purchase.  The device is also worth purchasing</li>
    <li> The rollers work great.  The only problem is they wear out pretty fast and so do the batteries in the tool.  I guess buying 4 at once has the advantage of saving money.</li>
    <li> Works just like the originals.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and will not hesitate to make additional buys in the immediate future.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like them very much. They are not course as described. I liked the price but not the product.</li>
    <li> You never know when a new roller will be needed therefore I believe it&#x27;s better to be prepared! When I saw the four pack I just knew I had to have them.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best deal I have seen for the replacement rollers that are compatible with the Emjoi Micro Pedi. We just replaced the original rollers that came with the unit and you cant even tell the difference. Will fulfill again with the Body Source!</li>
    <li> These are the refills for the Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  My feet have never looked better since I have used this product.  It is so easy to use and it works very well.  I used to spend so much time and effort to get rid of the dry skin on my feet, and to try to make them smooth.  Sometimes, I was embarrassed to wear sandals. This tool makes pedicures effortless.  My feet look great in minutes.</li>
    <li> They really work great!  It is the best product that we have found that both my husband and I use.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent deal and for the price I&#x27;m extremely happy.  I was surprised at how fast delivery was.  These work perfectly and I will definately buy these again when i need replacements.</li>
    <li> Emjoi is a great way to maintain a pedicure for MONTHS.  the cost of the rollers is minimal and they last at least 8 + pedicures.  I also bought different coarse rollers for heals vs. polishing my legs.  My legs and feet look better then actually going for a pedicure.  I HIGHLY recommend Emjoi products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these are quite the quality of the micro pedi brand refills, but for the price - about 1/4th of the price if I recall, they&#x27;ll do.  The work fine in the machine and last almost as long. I love my micropedi and this solves my refill problem.  you can&#x27;t find them in the store as far as I can tell so it&#x27;s nice to have an affordable alternative.</li>
    <li> Looks good, haven&#x27;t used it yet because I actually haven&#x27;t received the Emjoi yet but had to write because the shipping is INSANELY FAST. 1 day. Product appears to be a much better value then the brand ones that are far more expensive and probably the same thing.</li>
    <li> And feel of the original band, very good, worth buying!</li>
    <li> My Honey loves this product.</li>
    <li> I bought the Emjoi electric callus remover and bought these as replacements.  The remover is fabulous and these rollers are just the right coarseness to remedy my heel calluses.</li>
    <li> I wear sandals or backless shoes most of the time. These take down my hard scaly looking heels quickly and leaves me with a soft, nice looking heels. Works great and I love it.</li>
    <li> Already received and put to use.  Summertime perk for exposed feet. The Emjoi Micro Pedi is seriously good to have on hand and I use it on my son as well.  Ordering was a breeze...do it!</li>
    <li> Nice sanders...  The extra course is the best for my Emjoi micro-pedi Callus remover...  These don&#x27;t tear up your foot or anything like that...  Just nice smooth feet and no cracks anymore!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a little over a year now, and they are the best thing I have found to smooth out your heels. It&#x27;s amazing how well they work. I also bought them for my boyfriend and he likes them, too!</li>
    <li> The Emjoi replacement rollers are perfect and make the unit brand new all over again.  I would highly recommend these refills.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if I would by these or the Pedi again. It helps, but takes forever and is messy. For light dry skin removal. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for cracked heels cause it doesn&#x27;t do much for that issue.</li>
    <li> Best thing for my heels.</li>
    <li> Fit the micro pedi perfectly and have a harsher surface then the regular ones.  They really work well and are worth the money.</li>
    <li> These came very quickly and were packaged simply but well.  The cartridges are just as advertised and are a great resource to the Emoji unit.  I really enjoy it and find it simple to use and effective.  These came in a package of 4 which is great as they will last for a bit and lessen the effort to order repeatedly in the future.</li>
    <li> The package arrived very quickly in good condition. I put it into my Micro Pedi, it fits perfectly and works great! The price is unbeatable, so I will reorder again once mine is run out.</li>
    <li> This device is so much More efficient than the ped egg Love the ease of use. Great product would definitely recommend to anyone at any age!</li>
    <li> Works well and fits the unit easily.  I would recommend this product.  Good option and reasonable price.  Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> You will only get one use out of these. Poorly made product. You are better off spending more for the Emjoi rollers. I will not buy these again.</li>
    <li> The rollers are great and work very well. However I don,t feel the rollers fit as well as they should in my Emjoi.</li>
    <li> Work great and the price is awesome too!</li>
    <li> Poor quality. You will only get one use out of these. Poorly made product. You are better off spending more for the Emjoi rollers. I will not buy these again.</li>
    <li> Still using the original, these are backup.</li>
    <li> This little mavhine is amazing just love it it works wonders on.my feet is worth every penny I.paid  highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great replacement for the micro</li>
    <li> Works like it is supposed to!</li>
    <li> not fitting rite on the emjoi id like to return them</li>
    <li> Needed them for replacement everyone loves the product.</li>
    <li> Not even close to being as effective as Emoji brand name. The first one was completely smooth after two uses. Whereas the name brand ones stood up to the horrors of my husbands feet.</li>
    <li> Always works like perfection!  I wear sandals 8 to 9 months out of the year, so I need to exfoliate my feet on the regular.  The Emoji Micro Pedi was an answer to my prayers last year.  However it would not work as well as it does without the refills.  Every other use, I insert a new exfoliate roller and I have awesome results each and every home pedicure.</li>
    <li> I great way to get baby smooth feet!</li>
    <li> Seems just as good as the ones that came with my micro pedi device, I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I believe these are basically a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; of the original Emjoi rollers, and they don&#x27;t work well.  As another reviewer said, they wobbled and were unbalanced.  They also made a grinding sound when they were spinning.  They also don&#x27;t last as long.  I&#x27;m going to go back to the original Emjoi product, even though they cost a little more.</li>
    <li> These, used with their machine, work better than any of the podiatrists I have gone to.  Wish they were a but less expensive as I go thru them pretty quickly.  But, I have never found a better alternative.  I walk on my heels from a back surgery so I am an exceptionally &amp;#34;difficult&amp;#34; case.  But, even with the cost, I still save money over getting them done at the doctor&#x27;s. Most people will probably not use them fast at all, they are very well made product.  I have great insurance, but with the small co-pay, gas, time and waiting, these beat the doctor&#x27;s office hands down.  I&lt;br /&gt;now can take care if my feet all the time instead of just once a month.  PLEASE BE CAREFUL!  These are very powerful, follow directions&lt;br /&gt;exactly.  Wonderful product and they really work.&lt;br /&gt;If you use as directed you will love them.  If you dont, you may lose some skin you had not planned on.  Don&#x27;t be scared of these, they are&lt;br /&gt;the best I&#x27;ve found (over a 30 year time), just be&lt;br /&gt;aware they are not a toy.  Keep away from unsupervised children and idiots that don&#x27;t read.</li>
    <li> Love the micro-pedi, glad to have extras.  These work really well and are quality made.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;m glad the refills ate available from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works with the devise, why wouldn&#x27;t it be good?</li>
    <li> I like the product results.  Good value,</li>
    <li> Good price, good product.</li>
    <li> Shipped really fast and exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> love this gizmo but with they would last longer</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the need to replace my current roller with one of these replacements yet but they look identical to what came with the Micro-pedi. The package arrived quickly and in great shape.  I would reorder from this company again.</li>
    <li> I was worried that there would be a difference in these rollers because they are not made by the Emjoi company. However, they were completely compatible and worked perfectly. I honestly didn&#x27;t notice a difference and will definitely buy them again as they are much more reasonably priced than the brand name ones.</li>
    <li> LOVE these rollers. Perfect for my feet. Not too rough yet rough enough to take off the dry skin.</li>
    <li> Works great and a great price! Have re-purchased.</li>
    <li> fixes feet very nicely.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. What else is there to say about these things? I needed more and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Order arrived on time &amp; properly packaged.  Unfortunately I tend to walk around the house barefeet all the time on tiled floors. So this product works great at smoothing the bottoms of my rough, dry feet.  This supply should last me quite a while but will definetly reorder from this supplier.</li>
    <li> They work just like the ones that came with Emjoi.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with the quality.  I have gone through 2 rollers in less than 2 months.  The roller that came with my Micro Pedi lasted almost 9 months.  The quality is just not there.  The emery coating has peeled off in chunks and doesn&#x27;t do a good job of smoothing out callouses.  I would definitely not buy this product again</li>
    <li> i bought a micro pedi about a year ago, and found it to be amazing! the extra course micro rollers are exactly what i wanted them to be! Anyone who has not experienced a micro pedi--should! You will love the results you get with the course rollers.</li>
    <li> These work great and much cheaper than the ones I ordered for my pedicure machine.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again when I need them.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love my emjoi micro pedi</li>
    <li> My wife does nails for a living, and she her clients love this!</li>
    <li> Love these for my Emjoi foot sander</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  My feet are happy.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> My wife and I are big fans of the Emjoi and when we needed to buy replacement rollers, we looked at several places/websites for price comparison and this was the best deal. These rollers are great on the feet and really do their job well. Highly recommend this product especially for this value!</li>
    <li> These work very well on the calluses that my wife gets due to her psoriasis.  We have been very satisfied with the product in removing the constant build-up of skin.  When used properly, the rollers only remove the dead skin and doesn&#x27;t harm the living skin under and around the callus, leaving a smooth, soft surface.</li>
    <li> these work great , hubby and i use them almost every day makes keeping feet smooth so easy will order more w;hen i need them</li>
    <li> These work great.  They work just as well as the much more expensive rollers that come with the Micro Pedi.  They do not come with individual holders as the Micro Pedi rollers do, but you can keep these rollers in the hard plastic packaging they come in.</li>
    <li> I have no issue with the seller! However, I find that the replacement rollers from QVC are a better quality. I find that I am replacing the rollers more often with this brand. I&#x27;ll have to suck it up and spend the extra money on QVC!</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for Emjoi product.  Cost was reasonable compared to the price of a single.</li>
    <li> The emjoi rollers are great and make your feet feel wonderful !  Would recommend this product for anyone looking to get their feet ready for flip flop time.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE BY FAR THE BEST OF THE ROLLERS.  THEY WORK BETTER THAN THE SUPER AND THE EXTREME.</li>
    <li> Its a refil and it works</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE MY EMJOI. I USE IT EVERY WEEK. GREAT PRODUCT. NEEDED ROLLERS.. GREAT BUY ON THESE! THANKS BODY SOURCE!</li>
    <li> I only wish these lasted longer but you get 3-4 uses per roll.</li>
    <li> Really gets the dry skin off. Great product</li>
    <li> Working right as it described</li>
    <li> Good value and quick ship.</li>
    <li> These work exactly as the more expensive ones.  I will always buy these refills instead of buying the Emjoi brand.</li>
    <li> They should work just as well as the one that came with my new unit, and it works really well!</li>
    <li> This is a good buy. I love my Emjoi Micro Pedi foot buffer.....and plan on keeping these on hand so I never run out.</li>
    <li> I am sure these will last me more than 6 months with light use, fit the device just fine! Good buy.</li>
    <li> Even those these are on the expensive side...they are worth it! My feet thank you and having your feet feel good makes a big difference! Seller A+</li>
    <li> The package arrived fast and was packed well. Was a little skeptical if they would fit, but they fit perfectly and worked great!</li>
    <li> Wife loves the machine that uses these rollers, and this is a great value for 4 rollers. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Read the directions. SECONDS not minutes, otherwise a few days later you will know you used it too long. It works.</li>
    <li> good replacement roller</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the good reviews as a suitable replacement for the OEM product. I didn&#x27;t notice that they wore out faster, but I did notice that they were not made as precisely as the original. They were off balance and &amp;#34;wobbled&amp;#34; when spinning rendering use difficult.</li>
    <li> I love my micrppedi. The 4 pack and amazing g deal. My feet will be ready for summer if it ever comes.</li>
    <li> These work every bit as good as the Emjoi ones-and a lot cheaper.  I most certainly would buy them again.</li>
    <li> I use the Emjoi Micro Pedi rollers often.  I am very pleased with the results that I get.  The one thing that I would like is wishing that they were washable and reusable without loosing its effectiveness.  Otherwise, a great product.</li>
    <li> Great refills for my Emjoi.</li>
    <li> great, was here the next day</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product, and it is fabulous.  No more tedious filing with one of those wands.  This Micro Pedi almost instantly removes any callous.  I ordered the refill rollers to be sure I had them when needed, but the original roller that comes with the gadget lasts for months.....at least for me.</li>
    <li> These rollers are good, heavy duty and really work. save me money on my pedicures. They are better than the ones that orignailly come with the unit.</li>
    <li> I use these with the Emjoi pedicure machine and they get my feet nice and smooth. Not only are these refills cheaper thorough Amazon, but you get four in a pack instead of two which is what other retailers were offering.</li>
    <li> The price is much better at Amazon.  The rollers work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> These work great in my emjoi.  I did notice a slight difference fron the original refill, but all in all these work great.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These replacement rollers can be difficult to find and sometimes pricey.  This package was a great price. Hope I can get this deal again.</li>
    <li> Rollers don&#x27;t last very long.  Will go back to QVC for future purchases.</li>
    <li> This is one of my best purchases ever!!! LOVE THIS!!!!!</li>
    <li> My hands are very dry. I work with wood and drywall. I use these to smooth finger edges and remove the grooves from my nails. This is a very good product.</li>
    <li> They do the trick and use them all the time.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the results the Emjoi Mirco Pedi does.</li>
    <li> Was a Christmas present</li>
    <li> Great option for purchasing Emjoi Micro Pedi refills!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> These refill rollers work well for me!  After reading some other reviews, I was hesitant to try them.  Lower price finally enticed me to order them.  Glad I did since they work very well!  Fit well in my Emjoi, no extra vibration as described and, most important, they work well.  Make my feet ultra smooth!</li>
    <li> Great product- I have bought many and this one is the best. Fast delivery too- . will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I was concerned as I ordered these for my Emjoi and they are not branded.  They appear and perform just like the ones that come with my Emjoi.  Great price.</li>
    <li> fits my micro pedi perfectly!</li>
    <li> Did not fit my emjoi correctly</li>
    <li> Was shocked when these were delivered today.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is that these rollers are a little on the pricey side.  But they do work well.</li>
    <li> These MICRO PEDI REPLACEMENTS ARE GREAT BUT YOU MUST REPLACE THEM EVERY 4-5 USES SO FOR ME THATS THE ONLY DOWNFALL.</li>
    <li> Works Great! Better than I expected.</li>
    <li> It does an adequate job.</li>
    <li> great price and product</li>
    <li> these things really work well.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good price was delivered ahead of schedule  very pleased</li>
    <li> It works fine. I can&#x27;t say more,I don&#x27;t know for how long it will last.</li>
