      <li>Did the trick my skin is so much better easy to use and not very expensive</li>
      <li>SO WORTH it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant enough smell, like something you&#x27;d put on a baby, but it felt overpowering to me.</li>
      <li>I had been using a prescription which was working very well, and i decided to switch over to this because of the reviews I had read about how great it was- big mistake.</li>
      <li>This is the only product that you can feel confident with using knowing that the ailment WILL go away!  </li>
      <li>but this stuff does, FAST too!!</li>
      <li>Did not find this to be worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Fresh, according to the sell by date on the crimp.</li>
      <li>so I haven&#x27;t worn a halter or strapless dress / top in years and bare wear</li>
      <li>I ordered it here and after 3 days of applying this twice a day her rash is pretty much gone!</li>
      <li>I had to use on a fairly large area (most of my stomach, as well as part of my lower back, and some on my arms)</li>
      <li>Smells nice, does make a decent moisture barrier, but is kind of expensive.  </li>
      <li>Candida is a type of fungus that come from to much yeast in your diet</li>
      <li>The cream has to be applied twice a day to see th eresults fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon for carrying BAZA cream.</li>
      <li>so if I&#x27;m sticking with it that means it works very well.</li>
      <li>and this works really well to help control it when my skin breaks out.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product it really works.</li>
      <li>We use lamisil at first but it didn&#x27;t seem to clear it up.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend and choose this over Fungasoap which I tried before and saw no results.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these two products.</li>
      <li>I highly recommended this product.</li>
      <li>Ended up using generic 2% micronazole powders purchased at Target and W*****t which absorbed moisture and worked much better at substantially less cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my handicapped son is 30 yrs old and is in diapers, he has had a rash due to moisture and sweating, i have tried many creams to clear him up but a friend told me about this product, within a week the rash was gone, I use it every night to keep a barrier between him and the moisture</li>
      <li>I saw very rapid results as tinea versicolor faded very quickly the first few days, and disappeared entirely by the end of the two weeks.</li>
      <li>I skin healed quickly and stayed dry.</li>
      <li>I stopped using it and the fungus actually disappeared on its own in a few days afterward.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this because someone said that it cleared theirs up completely.</li>
      <li>I bought these along with the soap DermaZinc after trying so many other products like selsun blue etc for my Tinea Versicolor.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my husband and within 3 days, almost completely gone!</li>
      <li>so I did it for him about 3 times a week after shower for 2 months and WOW!</li>
      <li>from scented products, and as far as I can tell there is no indication on the page that it is scented.</li>
      <li>This was my second time buying this particular brand antifungal cream.</li>
      <li>This is great as a base in creases and parts that you want to keep dry and clean.  </li>
      <li>Nurses warned that bedsores and infections were a major sometimes fatal consequence.</li>
      <li>I barely used any.</li>
      <li>This product is not just for tinea versicolor, I suggest this for anyone who has dry patches on body parts (NOT face even though its gentle enough for babies) or rashes.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the scent is rather strong.</li>
      <li>Within the next two days it was back completely and although I was religiously putting the cream on it, it stayed.</li>
      <li>For women who cannot keep themselves right and when condoms seem to have zero effect for odd, fungal type deals - this product is the ONLY product of the many I have tested (MANY soaps and creams) that ZAPS out fungal infections without nasty smells!  </li>

    <li> Candida is a type of fungus that come from to much yeast in your diet I thought I had scabies,worms,it turned out to be Candida,Baza cleared my whole body with diet,I will keep buying to have in my medicine cabinet,Everyone check your symptoms with Candida don&#x27;t go all crazy like I did and buy everything under the sun,I&#x27;m clearing up and getting my life back..Thank you Baza!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb well in to skin</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I bought it for my husband and within 3 days, almost completely gone! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is disappointing that this product is unavailabe at local pharmacies. BAZA continues being great for protecting skin breakdown from areas of moisture such as under breasts and from incontinence. Most home care nurses in northern California are very well acquainted with BAZA antifungal cream which individuals were able to purchase through a supplier of home care products after Medicare visits concluded. Thanks to Amazon for carrying BAZA cream.</li>
    <li> This creme is amazing! I have had the embarrassing vesicolor tinea for a couple of years now. Did not know what it was. After realizing what it was I started searching for a treatment. Within 3 days of using this stuff, those spots I hid on my neck and back for years are gone! I&#x27;m so happy I found this. It is a big tube. I barely used any. It absorbs into the skin easily and has a pleasant smell. I am a nurse and I will definitely recommend this to anyone who has the vesicolor tinea. It works!</li>
    <li> yes and yes to what ever question you want to ask me.</li>
    <li> Did the trick my skin is so much better easy to use and not very expensive</li>
    <li> Excellent barrier cream!</li>
    <li> I had tinea versicolor on my chest for a long time without realizing it. After doing some research, I decided that the patchy dry skin was tinea versicolor so I bought Baza cream. It works perfectly! However, only use this for the two weeks it tells you to otherwise you&#x27;ll cause skin irritation, dryness, and itchiness which leads to sore abrasions on your skin. Even if the fungus has not cleared up, it will. I still had fungus in some places but I had abrasions from using it too long, so I stopped using it and the fungus actually disappeared on its own in a few days afterward. I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for any yeast related problem. It was advised to me by a doctor.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for my tinea versicolor problem. I only used it for about 3-4 days and my skin problem has gone away!</li>
    <li> I use once a week and I love it.  It cuts down on acne.</li>
    <li> This actually works! My husband has had an itchy skin rash on his torso area for a long time and it would get really bad during the humid summer months… we&#x27;ve tried everything from tea tree oil to a bunch of other things I can&#x27;t remember to name and nothing worked but this stuff does, FAST too!! He&#x27;s very happy I got it, no more itching!</li>
    <li> Non recommendable. Do NOT BUY. Goes on like tooth paste, stays on like messy tooth paste.Save your money try another product</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this online because my drugstore couldn&#x27;t get it.  It works fine. Our doctor had prescribed it and we couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
    <li> My daughter has had a rash for over a month because of antibiotics. We use lamisil at first but it didn&#x27;t seem to clear it up. Our dr prescribed this but insurance said it was an OTC medication. I ordered it here and after 3 days of applying this twice a day her rash is pretty much gone! Great product!</li>
    <li> I have tried several prescriptions for clearing up tinea versicolor, and have had little luck.  I started using this cream 3 days ago and the spots are almost gone.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has had a difficult time clearing up tinea versicolor.  Within 24 hours, I was already seeing a difference.</li>
    <li> I have a son who is disabled and wears Depends. This summer he got a jock itch type rash. This product was very effective in treating the rash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube...but a very little goes a LOOOOON way.  This is great as a base in creases and parts that you want to keep dry and clean.  I use this, then a coat of powder on top and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I only had to use for 3 nights before my spot went away. Worked great for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had tenea versicolor for over 30 years. This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used. After only 3 applications it has cleared up. Im no longer shy about taking my shirt of at the beach or in public. And no more Dr visits</li>
    <li> my handicapped son is 30 yrs old and is in diapers, he has had a rash due to moisture and sweating, i have tried many creams to clear him up but a friend told me about this product, within a week the rash was gone, I use it every night to keep a barrier between him and the moisture, I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has tinea versicolor and after doing hours, days and weeks of research, I found this product. This product is extremely think so you will need a very small amount and have to rub it in for a while. His issue is usually on his back and shoulders so I did it for him about 3 times a week after shower for 2 months and WOW! Such a difference. This product is not just for tinea versicolor, I suggest this for anyone who has dry patches on body parts (NOT face even though its gentle enough for babies) or rashes. His issue gets worse during summer and when he sweats so this helps out a lot. I highly recommend and choose this over Fungasoap which I tried before and saw no results.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for my husband.  He used it as directed and no changes were noticiable.</li>
    <li> Really works great and is easy to use. Very good for yeast infections that babies and anyone lying in bed for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> I bought this medicine for my mom because she is bed ridden it works.</li>
    <li> USED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE AT REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO AFTER HEART/KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS AS IT WAS SUGGESTED BY THE RIC MEDICAL STAFF.</li>
    <li> Good to have a reliable source without going from shop to shop to locate.  Fresh, according to the sell by date on the crimp.</li>
    <li> I bought these along with the soap DermaZinc after trying so many other products like selsun blue etc for my Tinea Versicolor. But this in combination with the soap works wonder for me. I highly recommend these two products. The cream has to be applied twice a day to see th eresults fast.</li>
    <li> This cream can&#x27;t be used in all instances of skin irritation and stings somewhat if placed on a cut or opening in the skin, but otherwise it&#x27;s an interesting product that probably has many uses I haven&#x27;t discovered yet, though I&#x27;ve already discovered one. The skin  between and underneath my breasts is vulnerable to yeast infections no matter how careful I am about hygiene. I&#x27;ve fought off those infections successfully with the proper remedies, but after so many infections my skin in those areas has become somewhat roughened in texture. As an experiment, I&#x27;ve been applying Baza antifungal cream after every shower (instead of my usual antifungal spray and baby powder) just to see if there would be a difference. Not only have I not had any skin irritation around my breasts since then, but the skin has definitely become smoother and less scarred-feeling. For that reason alone, I would definitely buy this product again, but take note: Just a teeny-tiny bit of this cream goes a long, long way, which is another reason I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used this about once to twice a day for less than 2 weeks and the spots I had on my chest disappeared! It worked :)</li>
    <li> I got this because I have Tinea Versicolor and wasn&#x27;t sure about it, this stuff is think and has a light smell to it...but Dang it it works! I&#x27;ve been taking this for 3 days and I already see the discoloration going away. I&#x27;d been taking Herb Pharm Fungus Fighter Herbal Formula for 4 days and saw a little change but the day after I started using this with it, there was a NOTICEABLE change. My versicolor was bad, My mom actually thought it was dirt (embarrassing) so I haven&#x27;t worn a halter or strapless dress / top in years and bare wear sleeveless- and when I did I had to put dermablend or bronzer on it. Now, I&#x27;m confident i&#x27;ll be able to wear whatever I want with no embaressment or body make up. SO WORTH it! Best part about it is how fast it works...other lotions and soaps I&#x27;ve tried said it would take up to a month but still didn&#x27;t work, I even went so far as to using Sulfur 8 but it smelled horrible I couldn&#x27;t using in the day time and it permanent messed up my sheets in the evening. BEST USE FOR TINEA VERSICOLOR I found period.</li>
    <li> 2/13/12 update:  Did not find this to be worth the price.  After using regularly found the moisture barrier didn&#x27;t work that well.  Ended up using generic 2% micronazole powders purchased at Target and W*****t which absorbed moisture and worked much better at substantially less cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/18/12 update:  I apologize - my prior review was wrong (product I received had bar code label affixed over the active ingredient label and I didn&#x27;t realize it - d&#x27;oh).  As A. Masek states in his comment, this DOES contain an anti-fungal, specifically 2% miconazole nitrate.  Smells nice, does make a decent moisture barrier, but is kind of expensive.  Will post an update on how effective this is after a month or so, but rating 4 stars for now (1 star removed for high cost).  I try very hard to be accurate and fair in my reviews and feel awful about making such a glaring error - thank you again A. Masek for pointing this out.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective if you use with Critic-Aid skin paste. I wish Critic-Aid can combine the two together to be sold as one item.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable. Best product I have ever bought from Amazon. Will by again and again and again..</li>
    <li> This was my second time buying this particular brand antifungal cream. There are a lot on the market so if I&#x27;m sticking with it that means it works very well. What more can you want from it? Oh yes, it was priced pretty good too.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best anti-fungal remedy I have ever found for prevention and relief of the redness, itching, odor and burning I chronically experience in my groin area. I sweat easily and have light urine leakage so I use  a Poise pad daily; but unless I use this cream on a regular basis, a fungal irritation develops. I&#x27;ve tried many powders and creams, but this product works best for me.</li>
    <li> I suffer from tinea versicolor or pityriasis versicolor and this works really well to help control it when my skin breaks out.  The only issue I have with it is that it has a mild odor that isn&#x27;t entirely unpleasant but I do not put it on when I am going out somewhere.  Just at night so I have not used it twice a day as recommended. I am otherwise very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I have large breasts and often get an unpleasant rash under them.  A light application of this cream each morning and the rash hasn&#x27;t come back. Love it.</li>
    <li> Baby had a serious fungal infection and this saved the day. Easy to apply and has waterproofing. Bought two more tubes.</li>
    <li> Four years ago my husband became bedridden from a stroke. Nurses warned that bedsores and infections were a major sometimes fatal consequence. A nurse recommended this,  it&#x27;s been used daily for four years and counting, and he&#x27;s never had a problem --thank goodness.</li>
    <li> This cream did little to nothing to help my rash that I have had for a long time(I have been told my rash was tinea versicolor by a doctor and a dermatologist). I had high hopes for this because someone said that it cleared theirs up completely. I had been using a prescription which was working very well, and i decided to switch over to this because of the reviews I had read about how great it was- big mistake. Within the next two days it was back completely and although I was religiously putting the cream on it, it stayed. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me its just white paste no difference to my skin no improvement waste my money I&#x27;m verrrry dissapointed</li>
    <li> I saw very rapid results as tinea versicolor faded very quickly the first few days, and disappeared entirely by the end of the two weeks. My only complaint is that the scent is rather strong. I had to use on a fairly large area (most of my stomach, as well as part of my lower back, and some on my arms) so maybe for a smaller area, or for feet it would not be so noticeable. It&#x27;s a pleasant enough smell, like something you&#x27;d put on a baby, but it felt overpowering to me. I realize this is subjective, but I know many people get headaches, etc. from scented products, and as far as I can tell there is no indication on the page that it is scented. If scent doesn&#x27;t bother you, or if scent is in the description and I simply missed it, consider this a 5-star review. It works great.</li>
    <li> i returned i realized i m not a doctor</li>
    <li> I highly recommended this product. It works beautifully. I&#x27;m using with my mother who is on bed and the skin irritation disappeared the next day or improved a lot.</li>
    <li> I found this a wonderful cream that clings to irritations that comes with incontinence it relieves pain and burning sensation when not treated with this creame. I highly recommend this product it really works.</li>
    <li> I used it for about a month and it did get rid of some of my tinea versicolor but not all. I am still using it now so hopefully it would all go away.</li>
    <li> For women who cannot keep themselves right and when condoms seem to have zero effect for odd, fungal type deals - this product is the ONLY product of the many I have tested (MANY soaps and creams) that ZAPS out fungal infections without nasty smells!  This is the only product that you can feel confident with using knowing that the ailment WILL go away!  Other products are treatments, but this is the cure.</li>
    <li> Grandma doesn&#x27;t have a fungal infection so she&#x27;s still itching.  The cream arrived quickly and in good condition.  It was provided to grandma by the hospital during a stay a few years back.</li>
    <li> Excellent topical cream.</li>
    <li> finally I found something that works to keep the skin dry.  I lost over 100 pounds and have to keep my skin dry and I came across this product that works great.  I skin healed quickly and stayed dry.</li>
    <li> This cream works great, I have used before during the last 15 years.</li>
    <li> I started noticing white spots on my arms shoulders and chest for a few months and they were gradually getting worse. I did some Internet research to find that it was actually fungus. This cream cleared it up in two weeks! Great product would recommend it for everyone.</li>
