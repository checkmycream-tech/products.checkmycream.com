      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>and I like it a lot better.</li>
      <li>I think this toothpaste is OK.  </li>
      <li>Everyone pays more attention to your teeth, not just you.</li>
      <li>my teeth areback to their original colorand</li>
      <li>A month supply (the 2 tubes) is only good for 1 person if you brush twice a day.</li>
      <li>I am chomping on the gum right now.</li>
      <li>I just started using it and noticed very quickly that it helps keep the my teeth very clear.</li>
      <li>As a dental assistant, I come across many different brands of whitening systems.</li>
      <li>This is the first whitening product I have been able to use and the result is terrific!</li>
      <li>The product kind of works but not very well.</li>
      <li>Containers are small but the results are good.</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t have the patience for the strips &amp; the dentist charges too much.</li>
      <li>Absolutely a must have for me</li>
      <li>Over price for what it really can do...</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a really bright white smile, this is probably not strong enough but he was looking for something to whiten about 2-3 shades, which it does.</li>
      <li>Works very well on my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money, I&#x27;ve used stuff over the counter for half the price and works better.</li>
      <li>so I am willing to use the paste daily.</li>
      <li>My teeth are pretty white to begin with because I use crest whitening strips however, with one week of using this product only once a day</li>
      <li>I notice a real difference between this other whitening toothpastes -  it really does remove coffee stains and keeps my teeth white between brushings.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product kind of works but not very well. My teeth probably only whitened up a shade or two. Not what the product promises.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing, the best whitener ever! My teeth are pretty white to begin with because I use crest whitening strips however, with one week of using this product only once a day my teeth were whiter than when I use the crest strips. I will be purchasing the toothpaste and accelerator from now on until this product is discontinued.</li>
    <li> I think this stuff is great. I notice a real difference between this other whitening toothpastes -  it really does remove coffee stains and keeps my teeth white between brushings. my teeth areback to their original colorand I don&#x27;t have to worry about the enamel.</li>
    <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t spend the money to buy it.  It didn&#x27;t work for me.  Using a product from my dentist and I like it a lot better.</li>
    <li> As a dental assistant, I come across many different brands of whitening systems. I have not seen any difference with my teeth. It has been 4 weeks. Do not waste your money, I&#x27;ve used stuff over the counter for half the price and works better.</li>
    <li> Works very well on my sensitive teeth. This is the first whitening product I have been able to use and the result is terrific!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy this again.  Didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  I bought the rods as well.</li>
    <li> Containers are small but the results are good.</li>
    <li> I thought my teeth would look noticeable whiter by now?</li>
    <li> This product makes you want to brush your teeth all the time! Everyone pays more attention to your teeth, not just you. Great stuff, just wish it were cheaper. A month supply (the 2 tubes) is only good for 1 person if you brush twice a day.</li>
    <li> My teeth are not exceedingly dark, but they do have coffee stains and age-related (???!!!)  yellowing. I expected them to whiten dramatically as per the televised promises: the users shown in the infomercial all have &#x27;refrigerator&#x27; white teeth. What I noticed when I used this product as directed for nearly a month was that my teeth were a touch brighter; the coffee stains remained and they still have a pale yellow color. I plan to return the product for a refund. (I did purchase the kit through their website.)</li>
    <li> I bought supersmile because it advertised that it can remove coffee and tea stains on bonded teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I used it everyday, twice a day as instructed.  It made very little difference on my bonded tooth.  Over all&lt;br /&gt;it did not work as advertised!!!  Over price for what it really can do...</li>
    <li> I think this toothpaste is OK.  I don&#x27;t notice a substantial difference in whitening my teeth.  But I think there is slight difference.&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste and lightening agent don&#x27;t harm the teeth so I am willing to use the paste daily.</li>
    <li> I have dingy teeth from coffee,not anymore.I use this toothpaste kit and the whitening gum.Absolutely a must have for me I am chomping on the gum right now.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband. He doesn&#x27;t have the patience for the strips &amp; the dentist charges too much. He is very happy with the results. If you are looking for a really bright white smile, this is probably not strong enough but he was looking for something to whiten about 2-3 shades, which it does.</li>
    <li> It has been quite awhile since I purchased and used this product.  Unless they changed the ingredients or method of use I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> I could buy over-the counter toothpaste that works as well.  Not very impressed with this product.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I just started using it and noticed very quickly that it helps keep the my teeth very clear.</li>
    <li> I have used Supersmiles for several years. Love it!!</li>
