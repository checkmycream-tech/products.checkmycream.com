    <li> Love MAC matte lipstick.  This color is a great neutral pink in my opinion and would work well on many skin tones.  This is what Yolanda Foster from the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills wore on the last season&#x27;s reunion show and I loved it!  Fortunately I was able to find a blog about her and what makeup she was wearing for that show.  Can&#x27;t find the color in department stores online for some reason. Found here on Amazon. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have a medium complexion with yellow/olive undertones.  I thought the color was pretty, but not on me. The lipstick is a matt finish and somewhat dry.  I felt I had to put chapstick underneath it, or it needed a bit of gloss on top.  Guess the matt look is not for me.</li>
    <li> Buythis is great for caramel colored skin tone</li>
    <li> Great! A very nice product! Love it! You can buy it that will not regret! Very good product for sure!</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick. To me it is a great color. It arrived on time!</li>
    <li> This lipstick was not as mauve as I normally like but I added a nice deep mauve lip pencil before I applied the color and it turned out lovely.</li>
    <li> original product, as decribed, could be any more happy! Thanks &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on other recommendations and am glad I did- Great Color- non- smelly and lasts just long enough- (I don&#x27;t like all day color as the lipstick is far to dry)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product</li>
    <li> Authentic and arrived fast. Brand new including the packaging.  The only negative was the color didnt compliment my complexion as i had imagined.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells like vanilla. It glides on so easily something about this formula is different than other matte formulas. It doesn&#x27;t take the crease of your lips. Give it a try it is like a pinkish nudish pink mainly nude i love it</li>
    <li> As expected. Very nice. I get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Not original. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I wanted this color for a long time and finally got it! I liked it a lot. It&#x27;s a good nude for \\&quot;not so white\\&quot; skins. Sweet.</li>
    <li> Mac lipstick is moist and delicious but  unfortunately, I did not find this &amp;#34;kinda sexy&amp;#34; AT ALL. The color was orange-y peach and that&#x27;s not how the color &amp;#34;read&amp;#34; online. Guess my girlfriend just scored a new lipstick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with this lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was the Maid of Honor in my best friends wedding, and the makeup artist used this lipstick on me &amp; I absolutely LOVED it (which is obviously why I bought it on here). She topped it off with Pure Zen lip gloss. It was GORGEOUS. I was getting compliments all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when this came in I tried it on &amp; just frowned in the mirror. It&#x27;s much more orange than I expected. It also has this gritty/powdery feel to it. &amp; it smells strange - I know that lipstick doesn&#x27;t smell this greatest - but it just smelled &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t touched it since I received it, which was about a week or so ago. I&#x27;m going to order the Pure Zen lip gloss to see if that will make a difference. Fingers crossed it does!</li>
