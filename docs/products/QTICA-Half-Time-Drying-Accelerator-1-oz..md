      <li>GREAT product,,,,Really allows for a dry to the touch, no smears or smudges, manicure in 20 minutes or so, helped by the oily finish.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this, I have three kids and don&#x27;t have the time to wait for my nails to dry, yet I love to do my nails and this</li>
      <li>Boy were the reviews right.</li>
      <li>Love this quick dry.</li>
      <li>it helps the manicure last longer and makes your cuticles look healthy.  </li>
      <li>It works really well, but I don&#x27;t like the oily feel after it is on.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>It comes with a lot more than other drying drops.</li>
      <li>however occasionally it turns my top coat a milky white...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, you will like it.</li>
      <li>Longer than it normally does with a top coat or other quick dry products.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t how people live without this product.  </li>

      <li>Quick dry time.  </li>
      <li>It really works and dry nails to fast</li>
      <li>You will still need to let your full manicure (3-4 coats of polish and base coat) cure before you clean the house,  but you can do a manicure repair (polish and top coat) and read in bed and then sleep without getting sheet prints.</li>
      <li>but my manicure is holding up extremely well for the first week.</li>
      <li>Not only did my nails dry fast</li>
