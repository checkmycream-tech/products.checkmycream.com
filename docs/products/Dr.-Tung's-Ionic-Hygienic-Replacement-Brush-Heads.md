<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These tooth brushes have had a very good effect on my teeth and gums.  Cavities have actually stopped hurting even though I haven&#x27;t had them filled.  I have also cured some of my gum disease using this toothbrush along with the water pic.  Haven&#x27;t had to have my teeth cleaned in 5 years.  Karen</li>
    <li> Just had my checkup after using this toothbrush for 3 months.  My hygenist was amazed.  Very little placque and my teeth looked whiter.  I gave her the information on getting this toothbrush for herself.  She had never heard of an ion toothbrush.  The heads  are expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a lark the first time I bought this toothbrush and knew I could return it. When I do wet the brush and my thumb, it does clean off MORE tartar then my normal brush. I have tested this several times. For my teeth, it does a better job and I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> My favorite toothbrush refills. I wish they came in four packs; however this is a six month supply. The product is sturdy and easily inserts onto the ionic toothbrush. The package is easy to open and the seller always sends them in a timely manner. These are excellent brush heads and well worth the price. My oral hygienist and dentist were impressed with the lack of plaque on my teeth and commented on how clean I keep them.</li>
    <li> Throw away your electric toothbrush,being using it for years and now send them as gifts in which I always get a wow my teeth feel  like never before and the dentist always comments on how very little buildup I have..</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Dr. Tungs ionic toothbrushes for years.....great plaque remover if used as directed.</li>
    <li> Even though I have an electric toothbrush, I prefer this one.  Thank you for offering it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that there was no place to select the bristle density (soft, medium, or hard).  I&#x27;ve used the ionic toothbrush for years, but always with a medium stiffness brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter had only 2 spots to watch a 6 months ago.  This time she had a lot of dental work needed.  The only difference I can think of was using a regular or spin brush, instead of her ionic.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this manual toothbrush but bought it based on the reviews.  I typically use a spin brush and when I received this I took it on a long trip.  My teeth felt so much cleaner during my travels, no sweaters on my teeth!  I got back and threw my toiletry bag in the closet and forgot about the Dr. Tung&#x27;s and when back to using my spin brush.  The end of day fuzzy teeth returned.  I dug out the Dr. Tung&#x27;s brush last week and now my teeth feel wonderful again.  *ting*</li>
    <li> You think you bought 6 tooth brush heads but actually there are only two in the package.</li>
    <li> Really misleading advertising. Only comes with two brush heads. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> They are so easy to snap on and off!  Also I love the bristles on these because they are staggered and they can get in between the gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> Really cleans your teeth!  Great for oral health.  Soft bristles with ionic action really works.  It lasts a long time, too.</li>
    <li> Hygiene conscious people, this is a must. You will notice a smooth feeling on your teeth after use of Dr. Tungs products</li>
    <li> I do think this brush is better than ordinary manual brushes and it does feel like it removes more plaque, my teth feel cleaner.I like the small head and the simplicity of it.Replacement heads are priced reasonable.Get it.</li>
    <li> Replacements heads are okay. It&#x27;s just at the time of ordering and also writing this review (in case it&#x27;s later changed) the picture shows 6, I received 2.&lt;br /&gt;I would have bought elsewhere for much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have had an Hi_G ionic toothbrush for almost 20 years and the battery still is as fresh as new. Replace the heads and you have a new brush each time. Makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> How much can I say?  Its a refill and it does its job.  I have been getting great reviews at my dentist since I&#x27;ve been using the toothbrush.  They asked if I was using an electric brush.  I think that is good, don&#x27;t you?</li>
    <li> There is no better tooth brush out there trust me you will never go back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Tung&#x27;s toothbrush, refills &amp; floss for 4-5 years and I love them...and so do my teeth. Feel very clean without major work and NO ELECTRICITY REQUIRED.</li>
    <li> deceptive marketing to sell  This product. Nowhere on the general description does it explain that there are only 2 instead of 6 toothbrush heads. It is not until one clicks into the details that it&#x27;s written in the fine print.</li>
    <li> Good Morning - thank you for your email earlier this week.  I received my order&lt;br /&gt;of the HYG toothbrush replacement heads and was very disappointed.  I thought&lt;br /&gt;I was going to receive 6 replacement heads as shown in the picture on the Amazon&lt;br /&gt;website but I only received 1 package of 2 for a total cost of $14.83.  I think the picture&lt;br /&gt;needs to be  revised especially as I could have bought a package of 2 replacements from&lt;br /&gt;another seller at almost 1/2 the price I was charged and I could see what I was buying.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning these to Amazon and buying the heads from another seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely</li>
    <li> Not sure of the how or why, but I have used this toothbrush for at least 3 years and have had some very nice comments from my hygienist.  Does a great job of keeping the backs of my bottom front and upper front teeth free from build-up.</li>
