<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for your average shaves.. upper and lower. Light (good) smell so as not to overpower before or after the shower.</li>
    <li> I liked it so much i bought a three pack when i started running low.  Gives a good smooth shave and lathers up nicely. I use a mug and brush. i don&#x27;t use a separate &#x27;whipping up&#x27; bowl.  If you have issues with this then you are doing something wrong.</li>
    <li> Does not have the classic masculine scent that is so wonderful to the wet shave experience.  Had to work much harder trying to get a good lather out of this soap, as opposed to Proraso.  Noticed more cuts/nicks.  Tried to get a good deal, going back to expensive soaps.</li>
    <li> For economy&#x27;s sake, I have gone old school on the shaving.  I am tired of paying for over-priced cartridges and cans of cream and I have gone back to the cake of soap and a double edged safety razor (Parker).  I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin and this soap leaves no residue when rinsed yet gives a good shave.  It does not build a big pile of foam, but does provide enough lubrication for the shave.  The one draw back is that if you are too slow, it can get sticky and you may need to re-lather.  It does not clog pores and although it is mildly lime scented, it does not leave behind a perfume after rinsing that can irritate sensitive skin.  It is like Neutrogena; it is that gentle.</li>
    <li> ... but it didn&#x27;t take. This soap seemed wussy-weak to my trusty badger brush. I performed the same ministrations with this soap as with all the others, but the Lime cake just didn&#x27;t want to play.&lt;br /&gt;Impressions:&lt;br /&gt;Artificial aroma, airy and watery suds, and no luxurious, heavyweight lather like Taylor of Old Bond Street Rose cream, or Omega, or the venerated, venerable Proraso. But this shaving with a double-edge (DE) razor, otherwise known as a \\&quot;safety razor,\\&quot; has changed my life! Just not with this soap. Sorry. There are way better cakes out there.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shaving soap. Great lather and scent. I will reorder definitely.</li>
    <li> I tried this soap today and it was alright. Lathers up well and lay down a good layer. It&#x27;s not like my Talyor Of Old Bond Street cream, but it works.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Smells like a margarita, creates a smooth lather. Has a slightly stronger scent than the last one I tried, which was Bay Rum.</li>
    <li> Great item! This was a re-purchase for my husband. It&#x27;s very rare that he likes something well enough to buy it again :)</li>
    <li> as described and nice scent</li>
    <li> This soap is great to shave with and smell cool also. I love taking my time with a brush and whipping up a lather to shave with.  When I do, a great smelling soap like this is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lime soap for my first wet shave.  It smells great! I was concerned at first of smelling like a citrus factory, but it&#x27;s subtle and hard to notice after my aftershave is on, anyway.  Made a good lather in reasonable time.  Will have to see how long this lasts. I have sensitive skin, and did have a little irritation when I&#x27;d finished, but I think that&#x27;s also a combination of my face not being used to a safety razor.  If it persists I&#x27;ll have to look into Prorazo; a little bit more expensive but there&#x27;s a huge fanbase for it.</li>
    <li> I recently got back into the whole shaving experience with an old fashioned razor and decent shaving brush. This soap came with the set and as much as it wouldn&#x27;t have been my first choice, it has become one of my favourites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good soap with a subtle scent and makes a really good lather. I heartily recommend it.</li>
    <li> Being new to DE shaving, this is one of two soaps I have tried. I bought a Van Der Hagen shave set and thought the soap it came with was so/ so. While searching Amazon I saw so many different brands and scents. This one caught my eye, and I am very glad it did. Col. Conk soaps are budget friendly, and this lime scent is incredible. I get a nice lather and pleasant shave. The lime smell doesn&#x27;t linger, but it is refreshing. Been using it almost a week now and the puck looks undented. Glad I tried it. Great price. Nice lather. Smells good.</li>
    <li> This is a nice glycerin shave soap. The lime scent is very sweet. It helps if you melt it and pour it into a larger container for easier loading of the brush (about 20-30 seconds, in bursts, in a microwave should do the trick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance is very nice for the price. It provided me a slick, cushioned shave on par with some soaps I&#x27;ve paid more than twice as much for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a fan of lime, like myself, don&#x27;t pass this up!</li>
    <li> Col. Conk Lime Glycerine Shave Soap is a great product. Leaves a great feel on your face and has a wonderful smell, that you cant quite put your hand on.</li>
    <li> Use this daily and really like the feeling of a close shave. Lathers well with the brush and smell nice.</li>
    <li> Once I learned how to make a proper lather with this stuff I liked it a lot more than my first couple of shaves with it.  Much to the chagrin of the hard core wet shavers out there I really do prefer using gel shave cream with my DE razor.  Shave soap isn&#x27;t something to use if you have to shave quickly.  It takes WAY too long to get a proper lather to be practical if you shave as part of your morning routine before going to work.  If I decide to shave the night before then I usually go for a shave soap rather than the \\&quot;goo in a can\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I use the bay rum scent and it is excellent. I thought I would try this and it is terrible. Smells worse than straight palmolive.</li>
    <li> Its an ok shave soap, nice scent, good lubrication when shaving with moist face BUT! then it tends to get dry and sticky on your face and it feels as if the razor wont glide...which it doesen&#x27;t, i like the scent, people complain it smells like dish soap NOT to me, it smells like a candy lime, i almost want to eat it ha, and people complain about the smell fading away when you lather up, Nope! i smelled it through out my whole shave..which was a pleasure, i love lime! so overall because it tends to get dry very quickly i gave it 4 stars. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shave soap for the scent and I really enjoy that aspect of it.  As it&#x27;s a glycerine based soap, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I&#x27;d like, but it beats regular shave gel hands down.  It works into a very nice lather with a shaving brush and clings to the skin well.</li>
    <li> I bought this, and I must say, I&#x27;m disappointed. It lathers poorly and smells like Jello. You could develop tennis elbow trying to get a good lather out of this stuff.</li>
    <li> I just finished my bar of Conk&#x27;s Lime and just ordered the bay rum scent.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other soaps and this seems to be the best.  The lime scent was great- a light,  refreshing scent.  It was difficult to get a good lather at first but after a few tries I got it just right and it was amazing.  I&#x27;ll always keep a bar of colonel conk in my cabinet. It goes great with my Merkur DE razor and Derby blades</li>
    <li> smells great and lasts for ever</li>
    <li> Love the smell - nice lather.</li>
    <li> Not a bad soap at all.  Great smell.  Smells like a subtle Old Spice.  I was not happy with the size, as it is a puck a little larger than a silver dollar.  I have a nice teak bowl to use, but had to use an old coffee mug for this one.  I might try ordering the larger version the next time to see if it will fit in my bowl.  Additional product demisions would be helpful.  Small deduction for the size issue, but overall very happy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who uses this type of shave soap every day. This was my first purchase of this brand and so far he is very please with the scent, and the lather. Says it works well. Would buy again and other scents.</li>
    <li> Smells great and gave a clean shave. I&#x27;ll be trying more of this brand. Worth the money. Better than other brands</li>
    <li> For the money this stuff is awesome! This is the first time I buy shave soap from this company. It seems to be a simple compound, that gets the job done and lathers well. The scent is a wonderful light-lime, with a hint of Apple in it, making it awesome for a shave during a hot summer. Although personally, I would prefer if the scent was a bit stronger because once u was ur face after the shave, u can no longer smell it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reies the other scents and this one and almond are the beat by far in my opinion. Not too heavy or too light, this Lime scent is just right!</li>
    <li> This soap makes a decent lather and serves it&#x27;s purpose for shaving well.  I personally like the fragrance, but some people have compared it to cleaning products because of the citrus scent. It doesn&#x27;t leave much fragrance on the skin after rinsing, so it probably isn&#x27;t an issue either way. The lather takes a little longer to build, but I discovered the time can be decreased by using a touch less water. That makes it creamy sooner, although you do get slightly less foam overall. Still seems to be plenty left over when I&#x27;m done, so it&#x27;s all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other issue, these soaps are larger than some of the other brands and varieties out there. They fit well in one of my mugs, but not so much in my smaller bowls - lather just spills over the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cake does seem to be holding up very well, I have been using it daily now for a couple of weeks and it is still almost the same size. I think this is a decent soap for the price, and I will continue to work the other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; into rotation.  I only wish Amazon stocked this directly so it arrived with my other products...</li>
    <li> My first experience with Col. Conk&#x27;s was with one of their &amp;#34;Super Pucks&amp;#34; that I bought at a local Shave Sharpening place.  The price was definatley daunting.  At just shy of $10, I was thinking &amp;#34;at this price I had BETTER get the best damn shave of my LIFE!!!!!&amp;#34;.  Well I fell in love with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;  I wound up buying the four pack on Amazon for just over $13.  I just started the Lime scented Shave Soap.  It is as good as the Almond scented super puck that I had started with.  And it smells very nicely of Lime.  Granted the smell of lime is nice, it is not the kind of scent I generally like.It is also more a scent made for springtime than for any other time of the year.  I will give this a 5 for an awsome shave soap.  But a 4 on the fact that the scent of Lime isn&#x27;t always a great scent to have.&lt;br /&gt;  Regardless of the scent, Col. Conk&#x27;s is an EXCELLENT Shave Soap</li>
    <li> Old school would recommend.</li>
    <li> The smell is great for this shaving soap. But it made me break out after a couple of uses. I have very sensitive skin so I am not surprised about this. I also thought the lather could have been better but I think that is just what you get with a glycerine based soap.</li>
    <li> I like the convenience of the container this comes in and I like the aroma as well (just would like it a bit stronger).  The soap makes for a good soapy shave.</li>
    <li> Dissapointed in the weak fragrance, as the marketing gives the impression of a stronger scent.  It is slippery and effective, makes a good lather,  but so does the Van Der Hagen sensitive type for only 2 bucks.  6 bucks is a bit overpriced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the straight/safety razor shaving so I have been trying out different soaps and creams. This is a good soap to try out, it smells good and lathers pretty decent. The slickness is ok unless you have a pre shave cream to make it a little more slick, so far I keep going back to the prorosa green formula just because its more slick and lathers up faster for me but this soap is good it might be better when I have more experience lathering up from a soap</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a brush and soap two years ago, and I recently upgraded to a badger hair brush and this glycerine soap.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the soap, the brush, or a combination of the two, but the lather produced by this product is thicker, and lasts longer, than the lather produced by the generic \\&quot;starter kit\\&quot; soap, bowl and boar brush I started with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with a safety razor takes some getting used to, but when I take my time it becomes a ritual I actually enjoy, rather than something to rush through to start my day.  I&#x27;m also proud of the real wood bowl and stand I have in my bathroom.  We speed through so much in our lives these days, it&#x27;s nice to slow down and enjoy a process, rather than focusing merely on the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer buy into the whole \\&quot;better, faster, more expensive\\&quot; shave experience the four and five bladed razor commercials try to package with the latest space age gel in a can.  For a smooth, comfortable, clean shave you can&#x27;t beat my grandfather&#x27;s safety razor, a badger hair brush, and Col Conk&#x27;s glycerine shave soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s bad. You just need to really work for a lather. The aloe and scent are really nice. I just prefer my proraso sandal wood better. Creamier and lathers up quicker.</li>
    <li> Being new to shaving soaps, I have researched the web forums and youtube until my eyes have crossed. I wanted to try both glycerine and tallow based soaps. I have purchased both and like them both. I wanted to try the lime because it seemed a little different. I enjoy it very much. It has a pleasant scent to it that&#x27;s not overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t last that long though, but not a big deal to me. It has a nice rich lather that is slick and with my Parker 90R safety razor, I was able to shave against the grain under my chin. I have never been able to do that before. I&#x27;ve used it for a few days now and I can&#x27;t tell any degradation on the puck which tells me it will last a while. So, if you&#x27;re considering Col. Conk lime, go for it!</li>
    <li> Lathers great.  Still comparing various brands and flavors.</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap along with another kind and a Shaving Kit. This particular soap came a little later and am happy with the purchase. I&#x27;d recommend to others interested in this type of shaving.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap is not really efficient. It&#x27;s no better than regular soap. I don&#x27;t shave very often (every 4-5 days) so this may be the reason why I need a thicker foamy or creamy soap.</li>
    <li> I know some people think it smells too &amp;#34;artificial&amp;#34; but I really like the smell. It is a bit harder to lather with my water but switching to distilled and working it a bit more make tons of very slippery lather. It&#x27;s my go to soap.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Unique scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*drys out in middle of shave&lt;br /&gt;*more of suds then a thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;*irritated my skin&lt;br /&gt;*doesn&#x27;t lubricate your shave; which leads to cuts, razor burn, itchy post shave and a patchy shave unless you take like 5+ passes..&lt;br /&gt;*worst of all after using it twice it seemed to be already 1/10th of the way used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a bad shaving soap. If you want a good cheap soap go with Mug Shaving soap, or Ingram shaving cream best for your buck!</li>
    <li> This is a fresh smalling soap that does a good job lubricating during the shave.  The lime fragrance is exactly like a lime, and then the smell goes away after you leave the room.</li>
    <li> this will leave your face as soft as anything Col. Conk makes and that puts it miles ahead of any of that c*** you can buy at the stores these days than come in a can, but this one smells like dish soap... yup...</li>
    <li> Col. Conk Glycerine shave soap is a superior product. Every now and then I try different brands and I always end up throwing them away and replacing them with the Conk. For a superior, longer-lasting lather I choose Col. Ichabod Conk Glycerine Shave Soap!</li>
    <li> Soap smells great, feels slick when shaving. Rinses off face and razor very well. My one complaint, although minor, is that the soap is an awkward shape, slightly too skinny and tall to work in any of my shave mugs well. Almost perfect, great lather, feels goods, shaves nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through half a dozen shave soaps since I switched from disposable blades six months ago and as of now this is my favorite.  it makes a real nice lather the consistency of which you can easily manage with the amount of water you use.  some other soaps go from glue to water consistency with nothing in between.  this one also has a nice crisp, fresh scent which makes sense since it&#x27;s lime &amp;#34;flavored&amp;#34;.  Definitely get a bowl for this though.  It does come in a plastic container but its a little flimsy and very difficult to open with wet hands.</li>
    <li> smell is weak, lather is weak, its useable, but far from the best lathering shave soap i&#x27;ve seen, smells kind of like industrial cleaner.</li>
    <li> I like Col. Conk soaps. The lather is not a thick as a Proraso (I love Proraso White) but it does provide plenty of lubrication for my beard and razor. This soap smells like a lime otter pop (this is not a bad thing) before creating a laterh. Kind of a sweet lime candy-esk sent. Once lathered it losses most of the sweetness and has a light lime scent. My only complaint is that it does not have as many moisturizes as Col. conks Almond soap and can dry my face out a little some mornings. I have pretty dry skin to begin with so those without dry skin will most likely have no issues. I have added a drop of vitamin E oil to my lather which helped retain the moisture (a good pre-shave would have similar effects). Overall this is not the best soap I have tried but is still a great soap for the warmer months and provides an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> Only four stars because I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  I&#x27;ve only used the cheap stuff that came with my shave brush and bowl set. Maybe there&#x27;s some expensive stuff out there that would provide some kind of extraordinary shaving experience that I cannot imagine. However, this does the job fine. Very light scent (lime) that doesn&#x27;t conflict with my aftershave.</li>
    <li> Love the scent but is mostly glycerin and does not lather well with a brush</li>
    <li> Has a good mild scent to it, i work up a pretty good lather with it and it had a nice slickness to it so there wasnt as much tugging from my razor.</li>
    <li> This review is in no way a reflection on the seller.  It arrived in good condition and shipped quickly.  The soap itself works does what it is supposed to exept for the smell.  It smells like dish soap.  I use Royall Lyme aftershave and thought that this would be a good compliment.  I will not be using it any more $5 for a one time shave.  At least its not a big loss.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the fragrance and the clean shave it really is nice! It allows the razor to glide over your skin</li>
    <li> I would have to say this review covers all of the col conk shaving soaps, even if I haven&#x27;t used them all.  This soap smells great with a mild lime/citrus scent.  And like all Conk Shaving Soaps it lathers thick and full with a shaving brush, and leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean when you&#x27;re finished.  This is better than any shaving cream or foam product that you&#x27;ll find in a can.  And for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Col. Conk, so you already know it&#x27;s going to be a good product that is easy to build a nice rich lather. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> This soap is not for everyone mainly because of the scent. It has a soda pop type of smell rather than lime. Otherwise I like it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to buy shaving soap often, one brick of it will usually last me about a year or so. This stuff is just plain awesome, the smell is right, it lathers/foams nicely, and that lather holds well. There are others out there that are admittedly better, but not for this price. Overall I feel you&#x27;re going to get a pretty good bang for your buck with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Col Conk always makes a good product.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is easy to lather as are the other soaps from this product line.&lt;br /&gt;The protection you get depends on the amount of product you use. For a super slick shave, I swirl my brush for about 45sec-1min and then lather with a good amount of water for about 1min-1min30sec. To produce a nice yogurt like shave lather. (But most of the time a 20second load and a 45sec bowl time to produce a decent shave lather.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Lime aroma dies pretty much after you rinse your face.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special accept the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a different color (lime green translucent) puck to melt into a cute bowl to make your den look a bit more cool, this is a 5star product. Else, it&#x27;s just another shave soap. I will be trying other Lime Shave soaps because of this one (It was a good Lime starter for 5 bucks.)</li>
    <li> Decent soap for the cost. Doesn&#x27;t have quite as rich of a lather as some other brands, but it&#x27;s very slick and provided a nice, comfortable shave. The scent is mild and pleasant and not overpowering. For the price, you could do a lot worse.</li>
    <li> Seems like the lime is really quite mild, almost unnoticeable. I much prefer the almond. But it goes get the job done.</li>
    <li> This shave soap smells like lime jello, but doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering odor,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather is better than the Proraso I was using before it, and is pretty great.</li>
    <li> I have two different types of Colonel Conk&#x27;s shave soaps and this one does lather extremely well, moistens well and is my top pic. The other in Colonel Conk&#x27;s amber which, though it does not lather quite as well as the lime, is still a wonderful shave soap.</li>
    <li> Great soap, smells good like a natural lime (not too strong), lasted a decent while, provided a nice shave, only wish it made a richer lather, a bit light of a lather and had to work pretty hard to get it.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s pretty good shave soap. It smells good and leaves his skin all silky smooth. The lime is nice.</li>
    <li> There is nothing more you could expect this product to do, it just works, plain and simple and its great for your complexion.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on reviews on amazon and love it. It&#x27;s easy to lather in a mug or in your hand. It smells good and is affordable. I will be buying col. Conk products again for sure.</li>
    <li> Great lubrication and glide, great smell, lathers pretty easily, washes off easily, inexpensive. Top notch glycerin soap that performs as well as far more expensive soaps. I&#x27;m a shaving geek, it&#x27;s become something I actually look forward to, and I&#x27;ve used high end soaps and creams like Trumper&#x27;s and Taylor&#x27;s, and I find this is better than many at a fraction of the price. Some have complained that the smell is like a lime life saver, and, yes, it sort of is, but I like it, it&#x27;s refreshing, not cloying, and not overpowering and when you wash the lather off, the scent goes with it, leaving your face neutral for aftershave or balm or nothing.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve compared this more expensive option with arko and Williams shaving soaps, and let me say this stuff is terrible feeling and at lathering. The best value for your money would be arko IMO. I haven&#x27;t tried proraso or old bond street and I probably never will because I have an expensive favorite that doe the job well (arko). Also, the packaging for the arko soap makes me feel like I&#x27;m inside the post apocalyptic world of fallout :-)</li>
    <li> Being a soap and brush shaver, I find Colonel Conk&#x27;s products&lt;br /&gt;ideal for the daily ritual of shaving--the lime and the bay rum seem&lt;br /&gt;to be my personal favorites.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Lathers nicely&lt;br /&gt;- Lubricates the blade&lt;br /&gt;- Leave skin feeling soft&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t leave a strange residue&lt;br /&gt; Cons&lt;br /&gt;- It only smells vaguely of lime&lt;br /&gt;- If it were more flat and round it would fit better in a coffee mug. its too tall and narrow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this soap but I would try a diffident scent</li>
    <li> Fast service, professional handling...&lt;br /&gt;This was part of a Christmas gift for my husband which included a new shave set.&lt;br /&gt;Great lather!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and fragrant. I&#x27;m certain to pick up more Colonel Conk shave soap in the future. I love the citrus scent! It also rinses cleanly, and leaves no residue on your razor, on in the sink.</li>
    <li> I didnt think it lathered at well as some of the other soaps I have tried. I recently purchased the Bay Rum version and will try it out as soon as I finish the last of the Lime stuff. I will post an update on that as well.</li>
    <li> Product smells great and foams nicely. Exactly what I expected from a Col. Conk product. I just wished they had more variety of smells and cheaper prices.</li>
    <li> nice shave. nice feel after, and not to strong of a smell.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I just am not sure I care for the Glycerine soap as well as the regular soap from Col. Conk.</li>
    <li> Smells like dish detergent, not a bad smell just very soapy smelling.</li>
    <li> The scent is nice but not strong. It lathers well and rinses clean. It melts quickly in the microwave and conforms to your mug or soap bowl.</li>
    <li> At first, I really liked this.  After I used all of it and switched to proraso I realized how crappy this one is.  Yes it smells good and lathers up, but its not the most comfortable shave.  Im looking for comfort and this is just okay.  It excels when it comes to holding in heat.  Very easy to produce a nice hot lather, but I feel it dries out my skin.  I will stay away from glycerine shave soaps in the future, but I would try other Colonel Conk shave soaps provided they are not glycerine.  I liked the scent but after you wash your face the scent is gone anyways.  This lasted me months of daily shaves.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to work up a nice lather with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse is its fragrance. I was hoping for a nice lime scent, but this soap smells like the lime scent of a bathtub cleaner, kitchen degreaser, or dish soap. Thankfully the fragrance does not linger once the shave is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again, and I probably won&#x27;t try other products in this line either.</li>
    <li> But I prefer the regular over the glycerine.  That is personal taste and preference though.  Didn&#x27;t notice much &#x27;lime&#x27; about it really either.</li>
    <li> I really like some of the other Colonel Conk shaving soaps but this one did not work that well for me.  It was not easy to get a good lather and the scent is kinda like green Jello.  I am a big fan of citrus smelling shave soaps but this one was just ok in my opinion</li>
