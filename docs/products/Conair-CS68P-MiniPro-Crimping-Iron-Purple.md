### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Even though it didn&#x27;t work out for me, i wish you good luck!</li>
      <li>good crimper to add volume to hair</li>
      <li>product itself works great, however the results are kind of ick.</li>
      <li>, directions were clear to understand, came on time and a very good price</li>
      <li>This product more for teenager instead of adults.</li>
      <li>and boy it sure is.  </li>
      <li>Havent used it yet since its a Christmas preasent, but hopefully its better the</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s probably better for shorter hair.</li>
      <li>It works pretty good for its size.  </li>
      <li>It has dual voltage and small,  perfect just for travel.  </li>
      <li>She loves and and its perfect for her small hands.  </li>
      <li>I got this for my granddaughter, she is ten years old and it is perfect because it is smaal that she can handle it.</li>
      <li>Of course not as good as bigger size crimper iron.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re right.</li>
      <li>The problem is it doesnt warm up very high or fast enough.</li>
      <li>iron is ok, my only issues are it heats up with no indication of the temperature, and doesn&#x27;t crimp like it should</li>
      <li>So, as you see, the looks of this mini crimper is cute and small; but that doesnt make your hair cute.</li>
      <li>Thanks in advance for ANY help here!</li>
      <li>Going a longer time between perms would be VERY helpful!</li>
      <li>Iron gets too hot but my hair didn&#x27;t get crimped.</li>
      <li>This is not for adults wanting to do an all over crimped style or large sections of hair.  </li>
      <li>When i saw the picture on the box i was excited, but when i tried it out you could barely see the crimps.</li>
      <li>The problem I deal with is that I get a perm (on extremely straight hair).</li>
      <li>It leaves more of a texture than a &amp;#34;crimp.&amp;#34; Not exactly what I was expecting</li>
      <li>It makes the crimps in Your hair look like feathers kind of, because of how small they are.  </li>
      <li>Buy a bigger model to get true crimped hair.</li>
      <li>It works great and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this product.</li>
      <li>Very cute crimper, small, stylish and very portable, but the crimps are also very small.</li>
      <li>This crimper is small and cute but doesn&#x27;t create much of a style I had hoped for.</li>
      <li>When my roots get to about 1 1/4 inches long the top of my head just looks flat.</li>
      <li>My 10 year old daughter wanted a mini crimper.  </li>
      <li>Maybe on some types of hair it works, but on mine(a naturally frizzy/curly hair, but straightens easily)it does barely anything visible.</li>
      <li>And if anyone knows of a tiny crimper with perhaps &#x27;deeper&#x27; grooves that would give deeper &#x27;bend&#x27; to the hair please direct me to that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting</li>
      <li>She does only a few sections of hair or her bangs for fun.  </li>
      <li>Makes small cute little crimps.</li>
      <li>Obviously it wouldn&#x27;t be &#x27;coils&#x27; as when permed but do you think it would make up for the straight root growth and look less like the perm</li>

    <li> Just as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very cute crimper, small, stylish and very portable, but the crimps are also very small. It makes the crimps in Your hair look like feathers kind of, because of how small they are.  product itself works great, however the results are kind of ick.</li>
    <li> Product returned too small!</li>
    <li> WHEN THEY SAY \\&quot;MINI\\&quot;, THEY MEAN MINI!!! Its about 3 inchs and only has 3 groves for crimping. I figured it would be smaller, but not the size of an ink pen!! Havent used it yet since its a Christmas preasent, but hopefully its better the it looks!!</li>
    <li> This is a mini min crimper. The plates are so small you can&#x27;t see the crimps. It just made my hair look frizzy. Buy a bigger model to get true crimped hair.</li>
    <li> We did not even take it out of the package when it arrived - it is tiny, I am not sure whose hair it is designed for...maybe a doll&#x27;s?  It would take hours to crimp even shoulder-length hair.  Not very practical in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It has dual voltage and small,  perfect just for travel.  It works pretty good for its size.  Of course not as good as bigger size crimper iron.</li>
    <li> iron is ok, my only issues are it heats up with no indication of the temperature, and doesn&#x27;t crimp like it should</li>
    <li> My mom doesn&#x27;t wanna get me it !</li>
    <li> Iron gets too hot but my hair didn&#x27;t get crimped. Not recommend for those who has thick hair. This product more for teenager instead of adults.</li>
    <li> So, as you see, the looks of this mini crimper is cute and small; but that doesnt make your hair cute. Maybe on some types of hair it works, but on mine(a naturally frizzy/curly hair, but straightens easily)it does barely anything visible. The problem is it doesnt warm up very high or fast enough. When i saw the picture on the box i was excited, but when i tried it out you could barely see the crimps. Oh and by the way my hair was straightened at this time. Some of the reviews i read said it was the size of a pencil and could work on doll&#x27;s hair... they&#x27;re right. Even though it didn&#x27;t work out for me, i wish you good luck!</li>
    <li> the handle is way to short, you burn yourself by trying to do your hair, had to use potholders to use. would not recommend for anyone.</li>
    <li> I got this for my granddaughter, she is ten years old and it is perfect because it is smaal that she can handle it.</li>
    <li> This crimper is small and cute but doesn&#x27;t create much of a style I had hoped for. It leaves more of a texture than a &amp;#34;crimp.&amp;#34; Not exactly what I was expecting and it&#x27;s probably better for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> good crimper to add volume to hair, directions were clear to understand, came on time and a very good price</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter wanted a mini crimper.  I had never seen such a thing but she used one at a friend&#x27;s house.  I couldn&#x27;t find one in stores so I came to Amazon.  She said it was about the length of a pen and boy it sure is.  She loves and and its perfect for her small hands.  She does only a few sections of hair or her bangs for fun.  This is not for adults wanting to do an all over crimped style or large sections of hair.  Also, I like that the switch is on the side and not on the inside near the plates like one of the other mini crimpers I considered.  It works great and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product but am considering it. The problem I deal with is that I get a perm (on extremely straight hair). I have to get one (at $65 a pop) about every 3 to 4 months because of root growth. When my roots get to about 1 1/4 inches long the top of my head just looks flat. So I&#x27;m thinking about the &#x27;mini&#x27; crimpers just for the root growth, to get rid of the flat look. BUT.... since the ridges are so tiny can anyone tell me if they think it would just make my roots look FRIZZY rather than permed like the rest of of my hair? Obviously it wouldn&#x27;t be &#x27;coils&#x27; as when permed but do you think it would make up for the straight root growth and look less like the perm has grown out? And if anyone knows of a tiny crimper with perhaps &#x27;deeper&#x27; grooves that would give deeper &#x27;bend&#x27; to the hair please direct me to that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting permed so often is hard on my hair (can make it look frizzy) AND is quite expensive. Going a longer time between perms would be VERY helpful! Thanks in advance for ANY help here! ;o)</li>
