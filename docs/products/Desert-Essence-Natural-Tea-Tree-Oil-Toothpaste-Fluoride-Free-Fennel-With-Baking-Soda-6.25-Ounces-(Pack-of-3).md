### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Really excellent taste!</li>
      <li>I have used the Desert Essence mint version of this for awhile and was very happy with it, but the fennel makes me look forward to brushing my teeth!  </li>
      <li>A Good Combob !</li>
      <li>Great product...</li>
      <li>It is a great toothpaste</li>
      <li>so I found this, and one would think based on the reviews that it is somewhat good...</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t think that using toothpaste this abrasive for the rest of my life would necessarily be a good thing.</li>
      <li>I will have to order a good supply this winter.</li>
      <li>and my dentist always gives me good marks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this toothpaste is amazing, it cleans well, has a very nice taste, and smells good too.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, it makes my teeth and mouth feel great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of toothpastes, looking for the right one without fluoride, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re just a more pleasant experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far though, this stuff has been really great!</li>
      <li>This product leaves our teeth feeling clean, produces no excess sudsing, and leaves a good taste in the mouth.  </li>
      <li>Tea Tree And Baking Soda Is Fine !</li>
      <li>I have been able to brush my teeth more since there are no harmful effects of fluoride that can impair me.</li>
      <li>but my teeth are really healthy looking now</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll like it... :)</li>
      <li>Leaves teeth feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>The fennel makes for an unusual, pleasant flavor.</li>
      <li>Ok, so my paranoia about ingesting fluoride every day brought me to this toothpaste originally</li>
      <li>I love it because it&#x27;s fluoride free, amazingly priced, and it has a surprisingly thrilling flavor (</li>
      <li>One more reason to despise and mistrust governmental and &#x60;nominally&#x27; authoritative bodies... :)</li>
      <li>Its turned out to be fine (although I didnt realize I ordered Fennel flavor).  </li>
      <li>A mild, refreshing taste.</li>
      <li>Now that I am free from fluoride</li>
      <li>Sooo I decided to go with Flouride free toothpaste and thought I would try Desert Essence.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying it and update this review as I see fit.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll use a fluoride free toothpaste that isn&#x27;t abrasive at all for a while to give my enamel a chance to recover a bit-</li>
      <li>Here in arizona it was really hot when it arrived and as soon as I opened the package I could smell it before I even opened the box!!  </li>
      <li>Tastes very fresh</li>
      <li>Gives you a nice fennel fresh breath and cleans very well.</li>
      <li>Not too much to say other than great taste, easy rinse.</li>
      <li>I can finally Live a healthy life.</li>
      <li>So kicking the fluoride habit seems to have been a very positive move.</li>
      <li>It tastes STRONGLY of licorice (which I normally like)</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to have such a fresh and strong (but smooth) flavor.  </li>
      <li>It has the same light, creamy texture and easy to use tube.</li>
      <li>It only takes a pea-sized dab on your brush and you have a mouthful of healthy, clean-your-breath foam</li>
      <li>First off, this is legitimate toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>The first day I got this</li>
      <li>But the best thing is that after a year or so of using it I suddenly (and without prior notification) noticed; gee whiz Wally, my teeth are really, really white!</li>
      <li>but I really love licorice so the fennel flavor totally rings my bell.</li>
      <li>I can tell for sure that the plaque accumulates more slowly during the course of the day compared to when I use a non-tea tree oil product.</li>
      <li>different in the best way possible to have your mouth taste like black licorice.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really work out so well for toothpaste.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will keep using these products as long as they&#x27;re available.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone wishing to improve his or her oral health.</li>
      <li>Nice and thick, too.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive gums, I would recommend you give this product a try.  </li>
      <li>I like it that all ingredients are natural.</li>
      <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular flavor (fennel) to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like black licorice, because that is exactly what it tastes like.</li>
      <li>so even if it costs more per tube than some of the other commercial brands, it actually lasts me longer because I use such a small amount each time.</li>
      <li>The taste reminds me of black licorice, which I really like, but may not appeal to everybody.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> First off, this is legitimate toothpaste.  I love it because it&#x27;s fluoride free, amazingly priced, and it has a surprisingly thrilling flavor (if you like black licorice, that is).  The first day I got this I brushed my teeth twice because it just feels so...different in the best way possible to have your mouth taste like black licorice.  I would recommend it to anyone!  However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular flavor (fennel) to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like black licorice, because that is exactly what it tastes like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of toothpastes, looking for the right one without fluoride, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found. Not too much to say other than great taste, easy rinse. The fennel makes for an unusual, pleasant flavor.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it makes my teeth and mouth feel great and my dentist always gives me good marks. The taste reminds me of black licorice, which I really like, but may not appeal to everybody. It only takes a pea-sized dab on your brush and you have a mouthful of healthy, clean-your-breath foam so even if it costs more per tube than some of the other commercial brands, it actually lasts me longer because I use such a small amount each time.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree And Baking Soda Is Fine ! Fennel Is Nasty ! Stick with Tea Tree and Mint ! A Good Combob !</li>
    <li> Tastes very fresh and i feel my mouth is cleaner than when i used Colgate.  But, I would not buy it again. The color bar on the back of tooth paste is black, which means all chemicals are used in making the product. Now, again in search of natural fluoride free tooth paste :(</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive gums, I would recommend you give this product a try.  It does not burn your mouth or tongue, like some of the leading brands of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great product... IF you like fennel flavor, which I DO!  It is a great toothpaste and I&#x27;ve ordered it over and over again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product a year now! I have been able to brush my teeth more since there are no harmful effects of fluoride that can impair me. Fluoride Tooth Paste and fluoridated Water has been a big problem in my health. Now that I am free from fluoride I can finally Live a healthy life.</li>
    <li> My family loves the fennel flavor on this toothpaste! I like it that all ingredients are natural. Gives you a nice fennel fresh breath and cleans very well. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is what people should use rather than the chemical toothpastes that are advertised everywhere by companies that do not care about you but care about ur wallet,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this toothpaste is amazing, it cleans well, has a very nice taste, and smells good too.</li>
    <li> Sooo I decided to go with Flouride free toothpaste and thought I would try Desert Essence.  Its turned out to be fine (although I didnt realize I ordered Fennel flavor).  It took several brushing to get used to but the flavor is black licorice.  I wont however order it in the summer anymore!  Here in arizona it was really hot when it arrived and as soon as I opened the package I could smell it before I even opened the box!!  I will have to order a good supply this winter. (next time a mint flavor, I still prefer it in the mornings)</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Ever since I started using it about 3 months ago I&#x27;ve seen a vast improvement in my gums, and the reason is the tea tree oil that is in the toothpaste. An added benefit is the baking soda for whitening. I highly recommend this product for anyone wishing to improve his or her oral health.</li>
    <li> Improved gum health. Tooth pain went away within one week of use. F I V E  Stars.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste. A mild, refreshing taste. Leaves teeth feeling very clean. Nice and thick, too. A bit pricey, but that&#x27;s the way it is with economies of scale, I suppose.</li>
    <li> Licorice lovers will savor the taste of this toothpaste.  I have used the Desert Essence mint version of this for awhile and was very happy with it, but the fennel makes me look forward to brushing my teeth!  I didn&#x27;t expect it to have such a fresh and strong (but smooth) flavor.  It has the same light, creamy texture and easy to use tube.</li>
    <li> Ok, so my paranoia about ingesting fluoride every day brought me to this toothpaste originally but I really love licorice so the fennel flavor totally rings my bell. Really excellent taste! But the best thing is that after a year or so of using it I suddenly (and without prior notification) noticed; gee whiz Wally, my teeth are really, really white! Didn&#x27;t do anything extra to whiten them. Didn&#x27;t happen overnight. Didn&#x27;t think about it at all and then; hey-presto: white teeth! Like I said, it took a year but my teeth are really healthy looking now and I am the apple of my dentist&#x27;s eye. Could be the baking soda in it. I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s a tad abrasive. I don&#x27;t drink tea or coffee or smoke so that makes a big difference too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And despite the fear mongering by the ADA, my teeth have not fallen out or corroded down to little stumps for the lack of fluoride either. So kicking the fluoride habit seems to have been a very positive move. One more reason to despise and mistrust governmental and &#x60;nominally&#x27; authoritative bodies... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if enamel renews itself or not. Maybe I&#x27;ll use a fluoride free toothpaste that isn&#x27;t abrasive at all for a while to give my enamel a chance to recover a bit- if wearing it down is indeed the reason for the whiteness. Gotta research that a little bit. But I don&#x27;t think that using toothpaste this abrasive for the rest of my life would necessarily be a good thing. So far though, this stuff has been really great! Maybe six months on and six off. Wadaya think? Try it, you&#x27;ll like it... :)</li>
    <li> Was looking for an all-natural toothpaste to replace a brand that started adding artificial, oil-derived ingredients.  This product leaves our teeth feeling clean, produces no excess sudsing, and leaves a good taste in the mouth.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I previously used Nature&#x27;s Gate flouride-free toothpaste for a couple of years. Well, when the time came to restock, my wife suggested something that isn&#x27;t mint flavored... so I found this, and one would think based on the reviews that it is somewhat good... I don&#x27;t know. My mouth feels really clean, but the flavor is just horrible. It tastes STRONGLY of licorice (which I normally like) but it doesn&#x27;t really work out so well for toothpaste. I&#x27;ll keep trying it and update this review as I see fit.</li>
    <li> I use Desert Essence tea tree oil products, including the toothpaste and mouthwash every day. I fully believe that it has made a difference in my overall oral health. I can tell for sure that the plaque accumulates more slowly during the course of the day compared to when I use a non-tea tree oil product. And my dental hygienist always asks, \\&quot;Are you still using the Tea Tree Oil products?\\&quot; She&#x27;s been noting that for years, tracking my progress, saying she believes it has made a difference. I used to get a lot of cavities. Now I haven&#x27;t had one in years, and probably only one or two during the 15-plus years of using the tea tree oil oral care products. By the way, I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but keep coming back to Desert Essence. They&#x27;re just a more pleasant experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using these products as long as they&#x27;re available.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this toothpaste. It keeps bad breath at bay.</li>
