      <li>I do like the product as good aftershave with a very soothing effect and nice scent.</li>
      <li>i think i like it better than \\&quot;gel.\\</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried different brands of after-shave and skin lotions, but this seems to be the best.</li>
      <li>with this i got a mild burning feeling at first, but i see this as a good thing because it means something&#x27;s got to be working!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s taken a long time to get my \\&quot;perfect shave\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It feels so good on your skin after you shave, very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other Nivea products for a while, and when I heard about their Men&#x27;s line of shaving products, I hoped for the best.</li>
      <li>I shaved this morning and my face still feels smooth and protected (@ 9:15 pm).</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s like a light lotion that disappears into your skin.  </li>
      <li>my skin feels immediately relieved, smooth, and moisturized.</li>
      <li>It leaves me refreshed and smooth feeling.</li>
      <li>It makes your face feel great immediately and lasts for a long time.  </li>
      <li>Nivea&#x27;s Shave Balm is great for after shaving, and it also lasts a long time too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aesthetically, the bottle is very sleek-looking and appealing to the eye.</li>
      <li>It is only good as an after shave.  </li>
      <li>Totally cool stuff from Nivea here.</li>
      <li>The scent is really mild, and fresh....not spicy</li>
      <li>The stuff inside seems to work great, but after the heavy smooth jar slipped from my damp fingers</li>
      <li>For those who have ultra-sensitive skin I recommend this, however, I recommend adding a mild salicylic acid face wash sometime afterwards if you are prone to acne or ingrown</li>
      <li>but its still good, just have to use a little more of it; put it on once, let it settle in, and then put on a second coat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my first bottle of this after shave for a year</li>
      <li>As far as the nose, the scent of this stuff, I find, smells differently out of the bottle than when applied to the face; it actually smells even better when applied with its nice, masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>really leaves you smooth a few minutes after shaving...and the very mild scent will not irritate your skin......</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good after-shave skin product that would moisturize my face after using an electric razor because my skin gets very dry and itchy, especially in the winter months.</li>
      <li>It really allows the razor to get close when you run against the hair on the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just be sure your hands are not dripping wet and don&#x27;t use it while standing over the sink - (carpet will absorb it if you can predict when it will fall).  </li>
      <li>My skin thanks you.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product as a person with very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It easily absorbs into the skin after a few minutes leaving your face feeling refreshed and ready to start the day.</li>
      <li>Very cool and soothing and razor burn really is a thing of the past for me.  </li>
      <li>I am bothered that the proce is represented as a discount when in fact this reduced price is actually almost a dollor more than what I would pay regular price at cvs or another similar store.  </li>
      <li>For those interested I also use: American Crew Pre-shave Oil, Bump Patrol Cool Shave Gel, and the previously mentioned foaming wash.  </li>
      <li>I had been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Post Shave Lotion for my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have ultra sensitive skin and after shaving I need something to help soothe and moisturize my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have dry skin and was looking for a reasonably inexpensive moisturizer/after shave lotion.</li>
      <li>There is a faint scent with this product, but it&#x27;s a mild, clean smell that doesn&#x27;t threaten to offend.</li>
      <li>think the bottle design is great, though the chump who gave it a bad review because he dropped it should probably invest in some hand towels for his bathroom before he hurts himself again.</li>
      <li>maybe i don&#x27;t have sensitive enough skin, wish it were a bit stronger.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m using this to replace the gillette \\&quot;complete control\\&quot; green after shave gel.. that didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
      <li>While I have always enjoyed shaving, my poor face didn&#x27;t share the same enthusiasm.  </li>
      <li>I only wish the price were a little lower ($5.99 in store) and had a &amp;quot;manly&amp;quot; scent (this has really no scent, which is not bad, but...).</li>
      <li>It feels so good when it&#x27;s applied, no burning or bad smells.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s taken a long time to get my \\&quot;perfect shave\\&quot;.  While I have always enjoyed shaving, my poor face didn&#x27;t share the same enthusiasm.  Often after shaving my face was red, irritated, and was painful to the touch.  After doing a lot of research I started steaming my face before I shaved and I invested in many expensive products.   I used a (real) badger brush, expensive shave oil, tons of different razors, shave creams, and aftershaves. I researched proper shaving technique. I talked to barbers.  None of it helped.  Thinking myself doomed, I grew a beard.  After a few months (and itching nonstop) it was time for a shave.   Having thrown out my previous aftershaves I picked this up at Walgreens.   In combination with the rest of my routine I can say with 100% confidence Nivea&#x27;s Extra soothing is the miracle I&#x27;ve been looking for all these years.  FINALLY I can shave and not look like something out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre afterwards.  The price is right, and my face feels great.  It helps to close pores with cold water BEFORE application.  This product may not be for everyone, as we all have different beards and skin types.  If you&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products with zero results try Nivea Sensitive Balm.  It might me what you&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
    <li> I tried this for my entire face but it did not work as good.  I figured it would minimize the size of my pores and moisturize it as well.  It is only good as an after shave.  It minimized the razor burns.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this, does not bother his skin; however, I purchased it at Walmart for around $4.00.  Slightly lower price.</li>
    <li> This is one part of my over-complicated shaving routine.  I have ultra sensitive skin and after shaving I need something to help soothe and moisturize my skin.  For those who have ultra-sensitive skin I recommend this, however, I recommend adding a mild salicylic acid face wash sometime afterwards if you are prone to acne or ingrown hairs(Neutrogena Acne Stress Control Foaming Wash works great for adults).  For those interested I also use: American Crew Pre-shave Oil, Bump Patrol Cool Shave Gel, and the previously mentioned foaming wash.  I&#x27;ve changed other products over the years but this aftershave remains necessary for moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I had been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Post Shave Lotion for my sensitive skin and I find that this product outdoes what I had thought was the best. As soon as I apply the balm to my face my skin feels immediately relieved, smooth, and moisturized. The best part: it lasts all day. I shaved this morning and my face still feels smooth and protected (@ 9:15 pm). Nivea For Men has an incredible line of top-notch products and the Sensitive Post Shave Balm is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetically, the bottle is very sleek-looking and appealing to the eye. As far as the nose, the scent of this stuff, I find, smells differently out of the bottle than when applied to the face; it actually smells even better when applied with its nice, masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product as a person with very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> i just tried this out on my face as i&#x27;ve had a horrible case of razor burn all day.  with this i got a mild burning feeling at first, but i see this as a good thing because it means something&#x27;s got to be working!  then it just felt soothing.  works for me!  i wouldn&#x27;t mind using it after every shave.  i like how the \\&quot;balm\\&quot; feels - it&#x27;s like a light lotion that disappears into your skin.  i think i like it better than \\&quot;gel.\\&quot;  i&#x27;m using this to replace the gillette \\&quot;complete control\\&quot; green after shave gel.. that didn&#x27;t do much for me.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the only thing i&#x27;m worried about is this bottle.. i can picture it already.  once i start to run out, it will take too long to get into my hands.  i&#x27;d prefer a plastic squeeze design for convenience.</li>
    <li> If you have rashes or blemishes and burning on your face after a shave, this is your stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for...  over 2 years now.  Like another reviewer stated, if you forget it, you&#x27;ll know it.  It removes the rash in like 5 minutes.  It makes your face feel great immediately and lasts for a long time.  The best thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it won&#x27;t clog your pores.      OK so the bottle is glass and heavy, I happen to like it.  Just be sure your hands are not dripping wet and don&#x27;t use it while standing over the sink - (carpet will absorb it if you can predict when it will fall).  If you still don&#x27;t like glass in the bathroom, transfer it to another container because this is the best it gets.</li>
    <li> The stuff inside seems to work great, but after the heavy smooth jar slipped from my damp fingers ( hey, it&#x27;s an after shave?) hit my sink on it&#x27;s tumble to the floor, each impact producing a thin, sharp,sliver, one of which I found the hard way, I have to say that the marketing genius who designed this bottle ought to be dope slapped with a cow liver.&lt;BR&gt;This is the first glass jar product I ever bought from Nivea, and I guess my last, at least for an after shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my first bottle of this after shave for a year and I have just finally begun to run out. While I don&#x27;t use it everday, I use it regularly and when needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use an electric shaver which often leaves my face dry and slightly irritated. This Nivea after shave is wonderful. It only takes a small amount to cover my whole face and neck. It leaves me refreshed and smooth feeling. Sometimes I&#x27;ll leave the house and forget to put it on, and I&#x27;ll go all the way back just to put it on. It gets your day off to a great start. No funky smells or textures here. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am bothered that the proce is represented as a discount when in fact this reduced price is actually almost a dollor more than what I would pay regular price at cvs or another similar store.  It makes me mistrustful of the other prices noted.   &lt;br /&gt;By the way- I do like the product as good aftershave with a very soothing effect and nice scent.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and was looking for a reasonably inexpensive moisturizer/after shave lotion. I hate products that leave an oily film or have pungent aromas. This Nivea balm has neither. It easily absorbs into the skin after a few minutes leaving your face feeling refreshed and ready to start the day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the packaging. A plastic bottle you could squeeze would be safer and more convenient than the glass bottle. (This should also make it cheaper to ship if you are ordering online given the corresponding reduction in weight.) This is the only drawback of this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4 stars (would have given it 5 if not for the packaging).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good after-shave skin product that would moisturize my face after using an electric razor because my skin gets very dry and itchy, especially in the winter months. I&#x27;ve tried different brands of after-shave and skin lotions, but this seems to be the best. My face has never looked healtier! I only wish the price were a little lower ($5.99 in store) and had a &amp;quot;manly&amp;quot; scent (this has really no scent, which is not bad, but...). I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nivea&#x27;s Shave Balm is great for after shaving, and it also lasts a long time too. I have been impressed with how far it goes and how well it performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it to help shaving the head, and it has been excellent to aid in touching up the shave for an extra close shave there. It may sound weird, but it works well as a touch-up shaving cream. It really allows the razor to get close when you run against the hair on the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, the product is excellent, and leaves a very fresh and invigorating feeling on the skin. Totally cool stuff from Nivea here.</li>
    <li> maybe i don&#x27;t have sensitive enough skin, wish it were a bit stronger. but its still good, just have to use a little more of it; put it on once, let it settle in, and then put on a second coat.</li>
    <li> finally tried this, and I definitely recommend it.  It doesnt have a strong smell, very pleasant and neutral.  It feels so good on your skin after you shave, very soothing and moisturizing. Try some, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> used to be unscented - now it has a &amp;#34;Neutral&amp;#34; scent. Shame they ruined the product by scenting it. There are plenty of other scented Nivea products...Looking at Aveeno products now</li>
    <li> The scent is really mild, and fresh....not spicy..musky...or cheap smelling ...smells expensive......HEY ! COOL.&lt;br /&gt;It really leaves you smooth a few minutes after shaving...and the very mild scent will not irritate your skin......great.......forget Gilettes balms, they dry ya out.</li>
    <li> For years I tried finding an after-shave lotion that actually did something for the ferocious razor burn and irritation that plagued me after a shave. I&#x27;ve used other Nivea products for a while, and when I heard about their Men&#x27;s line of shaving products, I hoped for the best. &lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt this is the best after-shave lotion I have ever tried. I&#x27;ve tried name brands and generics, but nothing comes close to soothing my skin without smelling like a chemical vat. There is a faint scent with this product, but it&#x27;s a mild, clean smell that doesn&#x27;t threaten to offend. &lt;br /&gt;I think the bottle design is great, though the chump who gave it a bad review because he dropped it should probably invest in some hand towels for his bathroom before he hurts himself again. I mean, who applies a product with wet hands to dilute its effectiveness? &lt;br /&gt;Great stuff, Nivea. My skin thanks you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and still enjoy the great feeling this balm gives my face after shaving. It feels so good when it&#x27;s applied, no burning or bad smells. After five minutes I apply Suave UV Protective face lotion($2.50) and I&#x27;m ready to go. My face never dries out or flakes, yet it never feels greasy. Try both products and you&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  Very cool and soothing and razor burn really is a thing of the past for me.  Give it a try.</li>
