      <li>I have been using this eye cream since I had eyelid surgery 3 years ago and it greatly improves the elasticity of the skin.  </li>
      <li>Product is great.</li>
      <li>and my mother was so so happy.      </li>
      <li>But for what I need it for, healing after surgery, it has been great.</li>

      <li>I am 54 and my skin has never felt or looked so good in years</li>
      <li>Skinceutical has good products.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Repurchase?</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly and still provides the perfect amount of moisture to get me through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item can be used morning and day.</li>

      <li>I do not believe this was an authentic skinceuticals product</li>
      <li>My husband is in love with this eye cream.  </li>
      <li>Minimizes fine lines and reduces puffiness.</li>
      <li>it does not apply smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t itch or burn.</li>
      <li>--gives a rejuvenated, fresh look and also diminishes fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>The box was sealed when I received it, so I assumed that it was full.</li>
      <li>So far I love the way it goes on-not too oily-appears to easily penetrate the skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never gone through a product so quickly and feel ripped off.</li>
      <li>You read that right.  </li>
      <li>love this product, only a little does a great job</li>
      <li>I love the bottle - you can simply turn the head to make the pump stop pumping, which is great for traveling, but there is some waste in the spout.  </li>
      <li>This eye cream is very reasonably priced considering its quality.</li>
      <li>Love the entire Skinceuticals line!</li>
      <li>(Thanks MOM!).  </li>
      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>and my skin evens out more when I get some sun, but I will continue buying it when I finally do run out, so readers should take that as a positive.  </li>
      <li>I really like this eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I just finished using the whole bottle.  </li>
      <li>Well Skinmedix shipped it out hyper fast</li>
      <li>Thank you Skinmedix for getting me this product so fast.  </li>
      <li>She said this stuff works so fast and so well.</li>
      <li>just a dab will do ya, but it feels very nice/soothing.  </li>
      <li>Great for tired eyes in the morning</li>
      <li>Very mosturizing for winter.</li>
      <li>Every once in a while I&#x27;ll pump out a congealed clump - I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a hard feature to get right, though!</li>
      <li>I used the smallest possible amount, not even a full pump, twice a day.  </li>
      <li>Expect little more for the price..</li>
      <li>it has several ingredients that I would look for in an eye cream, it isn&#x27;t greasy at all, you can apply makeup right after using it, it does help with healing, and somewhat with firming.</li>
      <li>My mother is a mother of 6, with a 32 year old and a 3 year old.  </li>
      <li>I have tried several products for the drooping skin under my eyes, and this really didn&#x27;t do anything for that.</li>
      <li>But this product is good quality a little pricy for how small the amount.</li>
      <li>This eye cream is not at all greasy or heavy, absorbes instantly and smooths away fine lines.  </li>
      <li>There is barely any darkness around his eyes now.</li>
      <li>I love how this soothes my tired eyes.  </li>
      <li>The Skinceutical eye gel in the little brown bottle works very well, and</li>

<li> It&#x27;s really hard to tell how _much_ of a difference it&#x27;s made, especially since summer is here</li>

<li> continue to use this product for a long time</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually buy creams, so spending on this was difficult for me, but this should last a long time, which makes me feel better about my purchase.  </li>
<li> I see slight improvement on puffiness but it has been only two weeks that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> Started using it after a week or two it would not pump when I opened it up its nearly empty???</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when the pump stopped working, but the bottle is almost empty.</li>
<li> Not a whole lot of difference</li>
<li> Such a huge disappointment!</li>
<li> Just a small pump is enough.</li>
<li> He won&#x27;t use any other eye cream, and I don&#x27;t blame him.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it at least once daily since I received it, about 1 month, and I feel like it&#x27;s made a difference.  </li>
<li> /&gt;He started using this cream, and after about 5-6 weeks said he noticed a difference in his dark circles lightening.  </li>
<li> My husband&#x27;s dark circles are hereditary, not from lack of sleep, and he&#x27;s had them for 37 years...</li>
<li> I had received it as a gift for doing a survey and never used it, but I told my husband that it is supposed to reduce dark circles around the eyes.  </li>
<li> I do use a less expensive firming cream over my eye (under brow), as this is costly and and ounce doesn&#x27;t last long if you use it liberally.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had very dark circles under my eyes since the day I was born</li>
<li> not sure if it will work, but fingers crossed.</li>
<li> They look especially dark in pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I am in my late 50s</li>
<li> The under eye skin on a woman is so very delicate and this cream moisturizes it so the wrinkles disappear.  </li>
<li> I have been using this eye cream for approximately 5 years (I do switch off to another eye cream in between bottles).</li>
<li> I had high hopes for this product, but I was very disappointed.</li>
<li> This felt very thin.</li>
<li> disappointing.</li>
<li> So I will not use this product again :(</li>
<li> Sad Please SkinCeuticals...remove this ingredient from your products!!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve had very dark circles under my eyes since the day I was born (Thanks MOM!).  ;)  I don&#x27;t usually buy creams, so spending on this was difficult for me, but this should last a long time, which makes me feel better about my purchase.  You don&#x27;t need a lot - just a dab will do ya, but it feels very nice/soothing.  I&#x27;ve been using it at least once daily since I received it, about 1 month, and I feel like it&#x27;s made a difference.  It&#x27;s really hard to tell how _much_ of a difference it&#x27;s made, especially since summer is here and my skin evens out more when I get some sun, but I will continue buying it when I finally do run out, so readers should take that as a positive.  I love the bottle - you can simply turn the head to make the pump stop pumping, which is great for traveling, but there is some waste in the spout.  Every once in a while I&#x27;ll pump out a congealed clump - I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a hard feature to get right, though!</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the advice of a aesthetician as the best eye cream but I don&#x27;t see any difference after using it for several weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best eye creams on the market--works well on men&#x27;s skin also.  Great for tired eyes in the morning--gives a rejuvenated, fresh look and also diminishes fine lines and wrinkles. Definitely recommended and the seller sent in an efficient, timely manner.</li>
    <li> My doctor had me buy this after surgery under my eye -  it has several ingredients that I would look for in an eye cream, it isn&#x27;t greasy at all, you can apply makeup right after using it, it does help with healing, and somewhat with firming. I do use a less expensive firming cream over my eye (under brow), as this is costly and and ounce doesn&#x27;t last long if you use it liberally. But for what I need it for, healing after surgery, it has been great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for approximately 5 years (I do switch off to another eye cream in between bottles). I am in my late 50s and I don&#x27;t have any crows feet. Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t itch or burn. Love the entire Skinceuticals line!</li>
    <li> Good stuff, expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Repurchase? yes.</li>
    <li> Tried to contact the seller with no luck?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came not sealed in a box? Started using it after a week or two it would not pump when I opened it up its nearly empty???</li>
    <li> I do not believe this was an authentic skinceuticals product</li>
    <li> my dermatologist wanted to sell this to me for $75, so the price here is awesome. just started using it so not sure if it will work, but fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> Thank you Skinmedix for getting me this product so fast.  I forgot to get my mom something for Mother&#x27;s Day, and I heard her talking about trying to get SkinCeuticals Eye Cream.  Well I found this on here, and needed it in short notice for Mothers Day.  Well Skinmedix shipped it out hyper fast and my mother was so so happy.      My mother is a mother of 6, with a 32 year old and a 3 year old.  You read that right.  Not to mention grandkids.  She is amazing.  She has been looking for something to get rid of the circles and puffiness under her eyes.  She said this stuff works so fast and so well.</li>
    <li> Expect little more for the price.. Not a whole lot of difference</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but I feel it does improve the skin under my eyes and reduces puffiness.  I have bought this product numerous times.</li>
    <li> I see slight improvement on puffiness but it has been only two weeks that I&#x27;ve used. Hope to get better results in weeks to come.</li>
    <li> Emollient but not greasy.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I just finished using the whole bottle.  I did not see any noticeable difference in the skin around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love how this soothes my tired eyes.  Ive noticed that you have to let is soak in for some time or when you apply make up, it cakes and pills up, for lack of better description.</li>
    <li> Product is great. Very mosturizing for winter. Last through out the day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream since I had eyelid surgery 3 years ago and it greatly improves the elasticity of the skin.  The under eye skin on a woman is so very delicate and this cream moisturizes it so the wrinkles disappear.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, especially since it was recommended by my doctor.</li>
    <li> My husband is in love with this eye cream.  I had received it as a gift for doing a survey and never used it, but I told my husband that it is supposed to reduce dark circles around the eyes.  My husband&#x27;s dark circles are hereditary, not from lack of sleep, and he&#x27;s had them for 37 years...under his eyes and on the upper lids.  They look especially dark in pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He started using this cream, and after about 5-6 weeks said he noticed a difference in his dark circles lightening.  I thought that maybe it was just his imagination.  They did look a little lighter to me, but I guess when you are the one with the dark circles, you scrutinize yourself a little better.  But within another month or so, I totally saw a big change.  There is barely any darkness around his eyes now. He won&#x27;t use any other eye cream, and I don&#x27;t blame him. This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> I so wish I could give this 5 stars In actuality I should not be giving it 4...the last ingredient is paraben which is Carcinogenic! So I will not use this product again :( But was impressed at how my under eyes were lighter, firmer, and that most of the lines had dissapeared. Sad Please SkinCeuticals...remove this ingredient from your products!! Please, so I can purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is not at all greasy or heavy, absorbes instantly and smooths away fine lines.  Just a small pump is enough.</li>
    <li> I think the creme version is probably richer. This felt very thin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think anything will help fix wrinkles, except a time machine.  But this product is good quality a little pricy for how small the amount.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I am 54 and my skin has never felt or looked so good in years</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when the pump stopped working, but the bottle is almost empty. I used the smallest possible amount, not even a full pump, twice a day.  The box was sealed when I received it, so I assumed that it was full. I&#x27;ve never gone through a product so quickly and feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream and have been using it morning and night for close to a month and I see no improvement whatsoever. In fact, similar to another reviewer, I think it has actually highlighted or increased the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. Such a huge disappointment!</li>
    <li> I have used this item on and off for years.  I have tried several different eye creams and always seem to come back to this one.  The cream has a light and creamy consistency - not too thick on too heavy.  Absorbs quickly and still provides the perfect amount of moisture to get me through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item can be used morning and day.</li>
    <li> You can always count on skinceuticals products. This eye cream is very reasonably priced considering its quality. Minimizes fine lines and reduces puffiness. Beauty must have.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product last week so I could not give it 5 stars as yet.  So far I love the way it goes on-not too oily-appears to easily penetrate the skin.  Skinceutical has good products.</li>
    <li> love this product, only a little does a great job&lt;br /&gt;will continue to use this product for a long time</li>
    <li> I have tried several products for the drooping skin under my eyes, and this really didn&#x27;t do anything for that. The Skinceutical eye gel in the little brown bottle works very well, and I now use that exculsively.</li>
    <li> when applying makeup over cream, the make up crumbles.  it does not apply smoothly.  i only use it at night now.  disappointing.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but I was very disappointed. Did nothing for my eyes at all.</li>
