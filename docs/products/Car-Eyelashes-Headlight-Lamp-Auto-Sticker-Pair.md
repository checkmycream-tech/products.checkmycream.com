      <li>Eyelashes scratch paint when driving..not good on brand new car..</li>
      <li>If you have a lighter color car you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
      <li>They are SUPER cute once you get them on, but at highway speeds the eye lashes will chip the paint off your car.  </li>
      <li>but if you buy something cheap it never works out..</li>
      <li>The glue melted because 1.)they were cheap.</li>
      <li>My integrity is worth more then $10 and</li>
      <li>Unlike me who got scammed Do Your Homework FIRST!!</li>
      <li>It started out really cute until I drove my car and parts started to fly off in the wind bye the time I made it to work that morning half of my lashes were gone in the wind.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be disappointed..buy the original CarLashes..</li>
      <li>Best option is to put them on a car with old paint only.</li>
      <li>I loved the look but they did not last one week.</li>
      <li>These lashes are only good for show.</li>
      <li>there really cute and very eye cathing</li>
      <li>if you would like to take this offer, pls let us know after you leave the good feedback, then we will give you back the full refund+one pair of car eyelashes.</li>
      <li>but they are quickly breaking off.  </li>
      <li>Cute but not made good at all &amp; 1 stone was missing</li>
      <li>They were dazzling and we loved them, until 2 days later we got on the highway and one half of a lash blew off.  </li>
      <li>hope you enjoy them as much as she does</li>
      <li>Everyone enjoys seeing them, and we have fun watching their reactions.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I was glad they were cheap</li>
      <li>and I was waiting for the right time to put them on my car and decided now</li>
      <li>was the right time.</li>
      <li>How hart can it be to put the right order in a bag and ship it.</li>
      <li>I was super excited to put on the lashes on my new Chevy cruze</li>
      <li>Luckily we caught it in time, so not too much damage was done.  </li>
      <li>The following is word for word the response they gave to my email \\&quot;hi, we would like to offer you like this: if you can give us the good feedback, then we will give you back the full refund+one pair of car eyelashes.</li>
      <li>First of all the minute I drove over 50 miles an hour</li>
      <li>got lots of looks, but first time on freeway doing 80 mph.  </li>
      <li>Must buy the eyelashes first tho.</li>
      <li>this item is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>They started falling off the first time you went on the freeway.</li>
      <li>and they marked my car!!!!  </li>
      <li>The lashes were nice, but they melt down on the headlights in the sun.</li>
      <li>I submitted a request for a refund and the seller denied none of this, they actually offered me a refund plus a free set if I would lie and give them positive feedback to mislead the rest of you.</li>
      <li>Amazon is allowing sellers to sell KNOCKOFFS of this product using the real products website photos and instructions, HELLO AMAZON, this is a CRIME as carlashes is a trademarked item.</li>
      <li>Im going over to carlashes.com and get the real ones.</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves them.  </li>
      <li>They are very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>the wind blew the lashes and scratched the whole hood of my car</li>
      <li>for $6 it was really a waiste of time.</li>
      <li>very dissappointing</li>
      <li>Just make sure you clip them down before placing them on your car.  </li>
      <li>Would Highly recommend both product and company.</li>
      <li>The adhesive glue, that comes on the lashes, does not work well with high speeds.  </li>
      <li>A little work, but they were so cute.</li>
      <li>first pair i got was good this pair after a few days some of the beads came off and half the eye lashes broke off</li>
      <li>I did not see any way for these to work with the new beetle.</li>
      <li>Had an issue with it sticking into place and ended up using double sided tape, it also sticks to the car when its hot out.</li>
      <li>They wilt within the first two days and flap back and forth damaging your paint and headlight.</li>
      <li>First off the package was in Chinese and so were the instructions but thank God there were pictures.</li>
      <li>and I used them to put fringe on the boots of a large female sculpture.</li>
      <li>Now they are on my little blue Kia and I love them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;they were beginning to mar the clear coat on my hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, only use this for cars that don&#x27;t go really fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had my car for 3 months and now the paint has been destroyed by these lashes whipping them at normal speeds!</li>
      <li>Although it sound easy it was quit difficult to get them all the same curl.</li>
      <li>Cute but not good for the paint.</li>
      <li>Return hassle wasn&#x27;t worth the price, waste of money.</li>
      <li>had mine on for less than a day and they were falling off and they marked my car!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> THIS CAR PRODUCT LASTED 1 DAY.OUTSIDE SUN &amp; AND WIND DAMAGED EYELASHES - VERY LOW QUALITY PLASTIC.DO NOT BUY !!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend saw these on a car in the parking lot and thought they were cute but the ones she saw were heavier. These uncurled and fell over the headlights every day when the sun shined on them... very dissappointing</li>
    <li> Amazon is allowing sellers to sell KNOCKOFFS of this product using the real products website photos and instructions, HELLO AMAZON, this is a CRIME as carlashes is a trademarked item. The real/original product can be found at carlashes.com and are NOT sold on Amazon....Unlike me who got scammed Do Your Homework FIRST!! The real eyelashes and eyeliner cost much more BUT are WAY better and WON&#x27;T RUIN the paint on your vehicle!! Plus you have to tell them your make, model and year when ordering them unlike the scam sellers on Amazon.</li>
    <li> We put these lashes on our minivan and were the center of attraction.  They were dazzling and we loved them, until 2 days later we got on the highway and one half of a lash blew off.  We were unable to get it back on and had to remove them.  The black adhesive strip is so tightly glued to the car, that it is stuck on our car.  So, only use this for cars that don&#x27;t go really fast.</li>
    <li> this item is exactly what I was looking for. I had never heard of eyelashes for cars until I saw them on a pink cadillac! Now they are on my little blue Kia and I love them.</li>
    <li> I wanted these for my motorcycle, she has &amp;#34;cat eyes&amp;#34; for headlights. They don&#x27;t proportionally fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought them because the website said they fit cars and motorcycles, but unfortunately instead of looking cute, they make it look angry. When I called the manufacturer, she told me to cut them down, but that didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all of that, they are cute for a car. Word to the manufacturer, would love to see a more proportional version for motorcycles.</li>
    <li> HI&lt;br /&gt;I put the lashes on yet after 2 days of just driving around town&lt;br /&gt;they were beginning to mar the clear coat on my hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;though very cute, i do not want to damage my investment/car.&lt;br /&gt;I took them off.</li>
    <li> I did not receive my eyeliners along with the lashes. Car paint damaged from lashes. Best option is to put them on a car with old paint only. The wind causes the lashes to scratch against the hood. Cute but not good for the paint.</li>
    <li> Had an issue with it sticking into place and ended up using double sided tape, it also sticks to the car when its hot out.</li>
    <li> absolutely terrible! They do not stay on the car!&lt;br /&gt;I had mine on for less than a day and they were falling off and they marked my car!!!!</li>
    <li> got lots of looks, but first time on freeway doing 80 mph.  it only took 50 miles to destroy,  and left black marks on my white suv that had to be buffed out.  i was happy with them until then.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to put on the lashes on my new Chevy cruze BUT i didnt turn out well. 1st i got them and they werent even curled up and you had to do that youreself 2. they didnt have the little white shinny stones they have on the picture :(. 3rd after the 2nd day of them been on one flew off and the other one was coming undone. for $6 it was really a waiste of time. there really cute and very eye cathing but if you buy something cheap it never works out.. I wouldnt buy this once agin</li>
    <li> When I bought this product, i thought they were cute. Then after a week the eyelashes were broke and scraping the top layer of paint off of my car. I thought they would last longer than just a week.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many things through Amazon and these car lashes of which I bought 4sets were absolutely terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They do not stay on the car!!!!!!!!!  I had mine on for less than a day and they were falling off and they marked my car!!!!  Had to use rubbing compound several times and wax to get the marks off!!!!!!!!!  Lousy lousy lousy product!!!!!!!!!!  Would not recommend to my worst enemy!!!!!!!!!  Site was Carlashes.com</li>
    <li> they were easy to put on. A little work, but they were so cute. I work 20 miles from my home and the speed limit is 45MPR.There were 3 missing and 3 broke half off. That made the looks, look trashy. So don&#x27;t waste your money. MY sister got some all also and the same thing happened.</li>
    <li> These lashes are only good for show. I drove on the expressway &amp; these lashes were flying all over the place. AutoZone sells some lashes that are much more sturdy, and way cuter.</li>
    <li> I bought it the car eyelashes and I was waiting for the right time to put them on my car and decided now was the right time. I went driving and pieces of lash broke off. I wasn&#x27;t even going 45mph and they just snapped. Not a very happy camper over here. Wish it would be more durable.</li>
    <li> I LUV THESE CARLASHES THEY LOOK SO GOOD ON MY CAR EVERYBODY ASK ME WHERE I GOT THEM FROM THEY&#x27;RE REALLY NICE TO PUT ON YOUR CAR YOU&#x27;LL LUV THEM!!!:)</li>
    <li> Much too flimsy, I had seen others and thought I was purchasing a firmer pair, very disappointed, guess they were less expensive</li>
    <li> These were a gift for my niece.  She absolutely loves them.  The shipment took awhile but Carlashes was great to work with.  Would Highly recommend both product and company.</li>
    <li> I put these on my car on a Tuesday afternoon and by Thursday 2 of the lashes were gone.  By the third day 4 were missing! The sound of them hitting your car at 40+mph is annoying and the worst of them all - THEY DAMAGE THE PAINT ON YOUR CAR!!!  I&#x27;ve only had my car for 3 months and now the paint has been destroyed by these lashes whipping them at normal speeds!</li>
    <li> The rein-stones are missing.This really sucks. How hart can it be to put the right order in a bag and ship it.</li>
    <li> First off the package was in Chinese and so were the instructions but thank God there were pictures. So I curls the lashes as they did in the picture. Although it sound easy it was quit difficult to get them all the same curl. Next I cleaned off the head lights with soap and water and dried them off (very dry). I peal the paper of the back of the lashes and carefully place the lashes on the headlights. I went back inside my home for a couple hours. As I came back out I noticed the curls in the lashes dropped, so I touched them up a bit. I drove to the grocery store (a 5 minute drive from my house)and the curls on the lashes were dropping again, and some were bent to the side it just looked really bad. I went home and when I arrived home the lashes were crinkled like french fries, I tried to reshape them and they just looked horrible the sun and a combination of the wind had fried them. I drove to pick up my daughter at her grandmother&#x27;s house (a 10 minute drive) and on the way both lashes flu off it was so embarrassing.... Theses things didn&#x27;t even last 5 hours on my car. The glue melted because 1.)they were cheap. 2.) The sun melted the glue and 3.) The wind bent them in all directions ! [[ASIN:B003X9W710 Car Eyelashes Headlight Lamp Auto Sticker Pair]] DON&#x27;T BUY!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product almost met my expectations. They didnt stay on as long as they were supposed to. They started falling off the first time you went on the freeway.</li>
    <li> Horrible product the lashes fell apart after a week and also stained the paint on my car from the wind while driving .</li>
    <li> My wife ordered a pair of these prior to reading there previous feedback unfortunately. They wilt within the first two days and flap back and forth damaging your paint and headlight. Once they wilt there done except for the damage they cause. I submitted a request for a refund and the seller denied none of this, they actually offered me a refund plus a free set if I would lie and give them positive feedback to mislead the rest of you. My integrity is worth more then $10 and some product I cant use and will throw into the trash. DON&#x27;T BUY THEM, THEY ARE KNOCKOFFS OF THE ORIGINALS AND WILL DAMAGE YOUR CAR! The following is word for word the response they gave to my email \\&quot;hi, we would like to offer you like this: if you can give us the good feedback, then we will give you back the full refund+one pair of car eyelashes. if you would like to take this offer, pls let us know after you leave the good feedback, then we will give you back the full refund+one pair of car eyelashes. have a nice day!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This was a very very cute item. With such a low price, no complaints are warranted. I would buy more.</li>
    <li> This product is very cute and unique, i haven&#x27;t put them in my car yet but I&#x27;ve seen how they look in carlashes.com and theyre super cute! Must buy the eyelashes first tho.</li>
    <li> first pair i got was good this pair after a few days some of the beads came off and half the eye lashes broke off</li>
    <li> My daughter loved them however in 1 day 2 lashes broke. Cute but not made good at all &amp; 1 stone was missing</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughter last year and she didn&#x27;t want them. After I returned them, she wanted the back... Of course I said, NO!</li>
    <li> They were easy to put on, I love(d) the look but they are quickly breaking off.  Are they not meant for winter climates?</li>
    <li> Bought these for two people for Christmas.  What a fun thing to have for two girly-girls!!  It&#x27;s great for my granddaughter&#x27;s jeep!</li>
    <li> These are not real they are fake. First of all the minute I drove over 50 miles an hour some of the lashes broke off in the wind. I loved the look but they did not last one week. However I did get them to stick good but they were the cheap kind you had to curl yourself. Im going over to carlashes.com and get the real ones.</li>
    <li> I loved it when I put them on and I followed all the instructions. The next day, I noticed that about half the lashes had cracked off on each side so I had to remove them. A lot of excitement and 24 hours of use did not make me a happy camper. Also, the tips scratched my wax off on the top of my car so I have to get them buffed.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets of these for Christmas presents this year.  They are SUPER cute once you get them on, but at highway speeds the eye lashes will chip the paint off your car.  Luckily we caught it in time, so not too much damage was done.  Just make sure you clip them down before placing them on your car.  If you have a lighter color car you&#x27;ll be fine.  Also, it is extremely difficult to secure these lashes in place.  The adhesive glue, that comes on the lashes, does not work well with high speeds.  What we had to do was remove the headlights on both vehicles we attached them to.  Get better glue/adhesive at an automotive parts store.  Then placed them on the inside part of the headlight and then put the headlight back in place.  Needless to say, those eye lashes won&#x27;t be going anywhere unless they are removed by hand!  Overall, I was glad they were cheap but they are time consuming and a bit of a hassle.  :/</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be disappointed..buy the original CarLashes..none of the ones shown are CarLashes..I bought the cheapies and threw them away.  CarLashes cost more, but they are worth it!  The fakes say CarLashes but aren&#x27;t..This name is trade-marked by the inventor.</li>
    <li> this product messed up my paint job what can i use to remove the stains the eye lashes put on the hood of my car??? im so disapointed!! and want my money back!!</li>
    <li> The lashes did not come with rhinestones as pictured, and they started to tear apart almost as soon as I started to drive.</li>
    <li> We love our Carlashes.  Everyone enjoys seeing them, and we have fun watching their reactions.  We are so glad that we bought them from the company that created them, because we haven&#x27;t had any problems with them.  They are very sturdy.  I guess it&#x27;s like they say \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.  Amazon, please don&#x27;t sell inferior knock-offs.  At least let people know that they are not the same quality as the originals.&lt;br /&gt;Joyce Small&lt;br /&gt;Panama S.A.</li>
    <li> Put this on your car and people will definitely know that you are a diva princess. Definitely girlys up your vehicle!!</li>
    <li> I did not see any way for these to work with the new beetle. Return hassle wasn&#x27;t worth the price, waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought 44 sets. Gave two away as gifts. Felt horrible when they told me the lashes scratched there hoods.</li>
    <li> They did not last long as the lashes snapped off after a couple of weeks driving with them on. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> the wind blew the lashes and scratched the whole hood of my car i put them on correctly and i hate them</li>
    <li> I like the car eyelashes.  I am an artist and I used them to put fringe on the boots of a large female sculpture.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my wife&#x27;s sister. she actually asked for them specifically. They look and stayed on GREAT!  hope you enjoy them as much as she does</li>
    <li> The lashes eventually break. And who goes around with a couple of lashes missing from your eye lash? Not a good look.</li>
    <li> It started out really cute until I drove my car and parts started to fly off in the wind bye the time I made it to work that morning half of my lashes were gone in the wind.</li>
    <li> After I got them., I immediately tried putting them on.. and the sticky adhesive that comes on them doesn&#x27;t stick.</li>
    <li> i can not wait till spring to put them on my new little red fiat 500  they will look awsome</li>
    <li> The lashes were nice, but they melt down on the headlights in the sun. Best to put on in the colder months.</li>
    <li> love them ,love them ,my son said my jeep looked like a mans car til i got my eyelashes now he&#x27;s changed his mind</li>
    <li> Horrible product! Scratched my car, awful had to pay 500 bucks to fix my paint job! Buyers be warned! Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Eyelashes scratch paint when driving..not good on brand new car..otherwise I like the look..maybe u could come up with something better..</li>
    <li> Everyone that see&#x27;s me coming waves and smiles or gives me a thumbs up who ever knew eyelashes were so loveable?</li>
