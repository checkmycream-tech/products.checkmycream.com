      <li>So I think this is a good oil to help in addition to healthy hair habits and diet.</li>
      <li>However, I do have very fine hair</li>
      <li>This product is very light.</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This stuff made girls have sex with me more no lie.</li>
      <li>Again, I really love the scent</li>
      <li>and I love the bottle that its in.</li>
      <li>so I have to get more.</li>
      <li>This is a nice light oil for moisturizing the scalp.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I also am on medication and have health issues so my hair doesn&#x27;t look as healthy as before.</li>
      <li>The downfall is having to dye my roots more where gray has grown in faster.  </li>
      <li>the \\&quot;stimulation\\&quot; is more like if you put peppermint oil on your scalf after washing...</li>
      <li>Unfortunately many stores in my area are discontinued it</li>
      <li>and I can also already predict this oil becoming a staple in my hair routine.</li>
      <li>Gro Oil washes out easily in the shower and leaves no residue or greasy feel.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong odor.</li>
      <li>I honestly noticed a difference in the first day.</li>
      <li>I love the applicator top to apply it directly to my scalp</li>
      <li>cool i had got my braids in</li>
      <li>My hair seems to be way softer and stronger, it does exactly what was promised!</li>
      <li>so i liked the old clove oil way better and the bottle used to be like twice as big too</li>
      <li>I love the results I&#x27;ve seen from this product so far</li>
      <li>I am asian but my hair is wavy and frizzy not like most asians who have smooth straight silky hair.</li>
      <li>The black hair industry is a joke, people start making your own products with natural ingredients so much better for your health and hair.</li>
      <li>It might depend on how healthy your hair or something im not sure, but i think i have healthy hair</li>
      <li>This is my first time purchasing an oil for my hair.</li>
      <li>on my scalp it&#x27;s very greasy though !</li>
      <li>This really works!</li>
      <li>I had girls tell me that I have pretty hair</li>
      <li>This is exactly what my hair needed.</li>
      <li>In the morning, my hair looks and feels amazingly soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>PRODUCT DOES EXACTLY</li>
      <li>use 100% pure coconut oil instead if you want hair growth.</li>
      <li>I think some other people expect this to immediately grow hair to your waist but come on, long healthy hair comes from a healthy diet, genetics, then hair care.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist cannot believe how much it clears my psoriasis.  </li>
      <li>a stop putting it on so much tho...</li>
      <li>and now it&#x27;s time for me to take it out because it grew to fast</li>
      <li>I a guy a straight guy</li>
      <li>and I still notice quite a difference in thickness of my hair and how fast it is growing.</li>
      <li>and it just feels like I&#x27;m putting cheap generic oil on my scalp with no tingling.</li>
      <li>It is very oily of course</li>
      <li>I really think it&#x27;s been helping with my hair growth, too.</li>
      <li>This product smells nice but is heavy and drippy.</li>
      <li>Even though I put a little but so honestly the less the better</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap and our little bottle will for sure last a year!</li>
      <li>This just made the hair have a sweet aroma and oily nothing extra was added whilst using this product.</li>
      <li>I think it the main ingredient mineral oil is what helps.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients look decent, I would like if they took out the coloring and fragrance then this would be the holy grail product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended...</li>
      <li>My hair is full and long.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re probably better off getting natural jojoba, black jamaican caster oils etc in order to see growth.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this oil for masculine balding, etc.</li>
      <li>But I just wanted to say that this stuff is so easy to apply, it is not super greasy, and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I notice some people complain that it is too greasy but clearly on the instructions it says put on before you wash your hair not after.</li>
      <li>So far, I would recommend it.</li>
      <li>I almost don&#x27;t lose no dead at all</li>
      <li>But yeah so far I like it</li>
      <li>natural fragrance is of cloves and herbs.</li>
      <li>It completely kept my psoriasis to a minimum.  </li>
      <li>I did notice more shedding of hair when using, but I think it&#x27;s just getting rid of old hair and since my hair is very thick, I appreciate the shedding and the growth of new hair.  </li>
      <li>So first time you should try it first in small bottle for sample</li>
      <li>Not sure if this is for healthy hair only</li>
      <li>I have natural curly hair, that needs moisture constantly, this oil makes my hair always shiny.</li>
      <li>We apply this nightly, 4 drops is more than enoug for her thin hair.</li>
      <li>Indoor air here in New England is very drying during winter, so I use a little in my part before bed and let it work overnight.</li>
      <li>I notice that my hair was a lot shiny and soft and long</li>
      <li>Now I only use in my hair just little bit to make it shiny but not too much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great! This product is very light.I saw a bit of growth.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products to help the psoriasis on my scalp.  I found this by accident a few years back when I was trying to grow out my hair for a wedding. It completely kept my psoriasis to a minimum.  I think it the main ingredient mineral oil is what helps.  I have tried other similar products with mineral oil but this product seems to work the best even though its not what it is intended for. My hair stylist cannot believe how much it clears my psoriasis.  I put a little on my fingertips and rub through my problem areas on my scalp.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light oil for moisturizing the scalp. Its not greasy at all and I love the bottle that its in. It has a dropper which allows you to control the amount used. A lil&#x27; dab will do you.</li>
    <li> I have longish salt-pepper highlighted hair. Indoor air here in New England is very drying during winter, so I use a little in my part before bed and let it work overnight. Gro Oil washes out easily in the shower and leaves no residue or greasy feel.  While I do not need help to grow my hair, I am happy with how this product moisturizes and provides gloss, my hair feels thicker.  This product smells great! natural fragrance is of cloves and herbs.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00449OCLG Dr. Miracle&#x27;s Stimulating Moisturizing Gro Oil - 4 fl oz]]This stuff actually works I swear. I wear braids all the time I will put this stuff on my scalps with my finger tips twice a week. I notice that my hair was a lot shiny and soft and long too it looked like a I had a perm, but I haven&#x27;;t had a perm in like 10 years. When I comb my hair I almost don&#x27;t lose no dead at all instead I grow extra hair. I a guy a straight guy and I use this stuff all the time. I had girls tell me that I have pretty hair and I also had girls give me their phone numbers because my hair made even more attractive. This stuff made girls have sex with me more no lie. Buy this stuff it don&#x27;t only works on your hair but in your life too.</li>
    <li> the smell is not very pleasant... the \\&quot;stimulation\\&quot; is more like if you put peppermint oil on your scalf after washing... its like a minty feeling... as for growth forget it... maybe try shaley&#x27;s sulu or red pimento oil for growth... Also I&#x27;m not sure about how natural the ingredients are. You&#x27;re probably better off getting natural jojoba, black jamaican caster oils etc in order to see growth.</li>
    <li> This product smells nice but is heavy and drippy. I have not been using it long enough to determine effects, however</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. When I apply this to my scalp I can feel it working all throughout the day and a little goes a long way. I do feel that this product has assisted in my hair growth.</li>
    <li> I bought this in an effort to grow my hair in a quicker amount of time as I have slow growing roots.  It worked. My hairdresser even noted that whatever I am doing, keep doing it. Well I ran out a few months ago and now my hair has slowed in growth so I have to get more. I do not feel any tingle at all, but it works. I put a generous amount at the roots only at night and leave it on till I have to wash it sometime the next day or two. It is very oily of course (it&#x27;s oil) so I can only do this at night or when I don&#x27;t have to be seen in public.  I do this a few times a week and I have substantial growth from very short to now medium (below chin) length in a shorter amount of time. I am Caucasian, but I have very dark, curly hair (that will blow dry and flat iron out straight with enough effort).  I did notice more shedding of hair when using, but I think it&#x27;s just getting rid of old hair and since my hair is very thick, I appreciate the shedding and the growth of new hair.  The downfall is having to dye my roots more where gray has grown in faster.  Nothing else I have ever tried including biotin vitamins, prenatal vitamins or other hair treatments (including other Dr. Miracle conditioners and growth products) have ever worked till this one.</li>
    <li> I have not had this item long so I will come back with a review later. I have seen no growth yet for obvious reasons. But I just wanted to say that this stuff is so easy to apply, it is not super greasy, and it leaves my hair soft and shiny. So far, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having scalp issues that I had to see a dermatologist about, hair shedding, breakage and tender scalp.  Along with precribed medications my Dr. suggested I used a daily hair moisturizer so I chose Dr. Miracles moisturizer gro oil. I had been using my medications for about a week on my scalp and the shedding had stopped , scalp tenderness gone. I added Dr. Miracle&#x27;s hair grow and the very next day my hair was all over my shirt, shedding like crazy day two same things so that was it for me, I immediately stop using it and the shedding has started to ease up. Not sure if this is for healthy hair only but it did not work for me and I want my $10 back</li>
    <li> so i liked the old clove oil way better and the bottle used to be like twice as big too</li>
    <li> I am caucasian, so this oil leaves my hair a greasy mess.  I do like to use it on the day before I wash my hair, though.  It washes out nicely and I think my hair has grown since I have been using it once a week.  The tingling sensation feels really good, and the smell is nice and clovey.  I can understand the opinions of the people who do not like this product.  This is one of those things that is inexpensive enough for you to buy some and try it yourself.</li>
    <li> I love the applicator top to apply it directly to my scalp but I don&#x27;t like the smell and it just feels like I&#x27;m putting cheap generic oil on my scalp with no tingling. Sticking to Dr. Miracles Follicle Healer.</li>
    <li> This really works! It says to use it twice a day but it makes my hair look greasy. So I only use it 3 times a week and I still notice quite a difference in thickness of my hair and how fast it is growing.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working ima stop putting it on so much tho...doesn&#x27;t tangle but i think i see some growth on my edges</li>
    <li> I am asian but my hair is wavy and frizzy not like most asians who have smooth straight silky hair. So my hair has been feeling super dry lately. I also am on medication and have health issues so my hair doesn&#x27;t look as healthy as before. I use to Co wash and oil my hair and scalp before I shower and I noticed my hair was softer and shinier. But I get so lazy to mix oils and heat it up then apply to my hair in a cup. It felt messy and inconvenient. So I decided to buy this on a whim. The ingredients look decent, I would like if they took out the coloring and fragrance then this would be the holy grail product. I notice some people complain that it is too greasy but clearly on the instructions it says put on before you wash your hair not after. I mean, if you use a little bit on the ends after I think it&#x27;s fine or if you have extremely kinky hair. It is oil after all. But yeah so far I like it so I hope they continue to sell this at my local store and do not jack up the price. Oh yeah I think some other people expect this to immediately grow hair to your waist but come on, long healthy hair comes from a healthy diet, genetics, then hair care. So I think this is a good oil to help in addition to healthy hair habits and diet. But yeah 5 star!!!</li>
    <li> My child suffers from severe scalp psoriasis. We have tried every medication prescribed by her dermatologist. Trial and error, money wasted. Nothing has worked. She&#x27;s 4 so limited on treatment for her age. Coconut oil works but only if coated on thick which is messy. We apply this nightly, 4 drops is more than enoug for her thin hair. After one week there was no psoriasis except in her ears! We missed two nights and we saw a few flakes. But nothing like it was! Since she is Caucasian, her hair is thin and it does make it a little oily but nothing a ponytail , bow and hairspray-maybe some baby powder too/can&#x27;t fix! It&#x27;s cheap and our little bottle will for sure last a year! Dr miracles gro oil has been a LIFESAVER! And it&#x27;s not a medicine which makes me happy!</li>
    <li> This is the best scalp oil I have found. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and always come back to his one. Unfortunately many stores in my area are discontinued it I was very pleased to find it on amazon. I will now simply order a supply online. I recommend this oil for anyone with dry scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> This just made the hair have a sweet aroma and oily nothing extra was added whilst using this product.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS GREAT FOR GROWING HAIR.</li>
    <li> I didnt use it long enough to see improvements. It has a strong odor. Heard it was a good product.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with all of these items</li>
    <li> Just received it. have not used it long</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as described</li>
    <li> I use this oil twice weekly, and it makes my head tingle. Whether my hair would grow without, I don&#x27;t want to take the chance. My hair is full and long. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> My experience was Horrible!!! (But then again, everyone is different) My hair began to slowly shed and I used it for a twice a day for a few weeks. This product has no type of benefits.  use 100% pure coconut oil instead if you want hair growth.</li>
    <li> Have been using this oil since last couple years now. Definitely controls hair fall. I just apply it 30mins before I shower and use it ever other day. Works great! Would highly recommend this oil for masculine balding, etc.</li>
    <li> I like this item but it seems different than the Dr Wonder oil I have used in the past. it arrived on time. Protective packaging in tact.</li>
    <li> I usually would go to purchase this product at the store but I have been noticing that not a lot of retailers are carrying it in my area. Since I would&#x27;ve had to order it online anyway, why not purchase it through my fav site!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my hair needed. I have natural curly hair, that needs moisture constantly, this oil makes my hair always shiny. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells great and leaves my hair nice and soft. However, I do have very fine hair so I can not wear this throughout the day. I usually put this product on before bed, leave it on overnight and wash my hair in the morning. If I try to use the product during the day, my hair looks extremely greasy and oily (practically wet!). I love the results I&#x27;ve seen from this product so far, can&#x27;t wait to continue using it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Makes your hair grow. Not too oily. Tingiling on the scalp. Has a bit of a scent. Will be using it again. Does what it says.</li>
    <li> Tried this on a whim when I saw it in Walmart. The cooling, tingling sensation feels awesome. At night, I like to put some on my scalp and rub it in, comb my hair down, then put a scarf on and sleep on it. In the morning, my hair looks and feels amazingly soft and smooth. Some people might not dig the smell, but I can&#x27;t get enough of it. I really think it&#x27;s been helping with my hair growth, too.</li>
    <li> Dr Miracles is one of the worst products on the Marley and there are so many useless products. This just sucked all the pills from my hair and smelt so toxic, terrible product don&#x27;t buy please. It&#x27;s like putting a jar of medicine on your hair. The black hair industry is a joke, people start making your own products with natural ingredients so much better for your health and hair.</li>
    <li> I love all dr. Miracle products! This oil is great I put it on my ends and on my scalp it&#x27;s very greasy though ! It made a mess on my pillow cases and sheets ........ Even though I put a little but so honestly the less the better but I like this product .</li>
    <li> works good not oily makes my hair feel good.</li>
    <li> It arrived as stated. Product was sealed and on time as noted. Great job. I will be using this site again. Highly recommended...</li>
    <li> This item works,i used it and the 2nd day my hair was growing this is crazy but cool i had got my braids in and i put it in tht day and now it&#x27;s time for me to take it out because it grew to fast</li>
    <li> Shipped fast with PRIME, I always use Dr. Miracle and it&#x27;s one of the few products I use on my hair. When you use it has a tingling feeling and I personally think my hair is stronger and it grows faster by using this product and other products made my DR. Miracle</li>
    <li> I had problem with scalp. I used this oil after bath and shampoo. But I don&#x27;t see the result my hair still fall and I feel itchy if I don&#x27;t wash my hair in 2 or 3 days. Now I only use in my hair just little bit to make it shiny but not too much. So first time you should try it first in small bottle for sample but they don&#x27;t have it. So just be careful for your scalp. The bad things I bought it 2 bottles. And I don&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
    <li> Do not get this product on your hands without a paper towel. Other than that  I quess its good  Try it for youself</li>
    <li> It might depend on how healthy your hair or something im not sure, but i think i have healthy hair and i just started a routine to make my hair healthier and longer. So i use this oil every other day in the week and im not lying but my hair literally grew an inch with the help of this oil. definetly going to keep using this</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing an oil for my hair. I have extremely dry, damaged hair, with a scalp to match. I opened the bottle and I immediately got this pleasant scent of oranges. I started using it every morning and I can already notice a difference. My hair seems to be way softer and stronger, it does exactly what was promised! I honestly noticed a difference in the first day. Again, I really love the scent and I can also already predict this oil becoming a staple in my hair routine. I&#x27;ll probably end up writing another review once I&#x27;ve used it longer to see if it actually makes my hair grow.</li>
