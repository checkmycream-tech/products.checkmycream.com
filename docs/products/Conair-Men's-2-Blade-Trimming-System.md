      <li>Will the hair be able to defeat the whirring Conair Trimmer monster?</li>
      <li>used to use a &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; nose hair trimmer with the circular blades, but this is much more versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Spend $3 more and get the Remington PG-165...</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll be glad you did.  </li>
      <li>sure to go with a full-size body trimmer if you need to do any landscaping south of the head and neck, though.</li>
      <li>So after 5 years of use, this trimmer still worked perfectly EVEN AFTER I had snapped the internal plastic clip that holds the blade in place.</li>
      <li>I find it works MUCH BETTER as an eyebrow trimmer than even as a moustache trimmer.</li>
      <li>Very good, no problem using it.it cut clean and fast.</li>
      <li>When they&#x27;re new they work great</li>

      <li>The large blade is good for making neat edges along the lip and outline of the beard.</li>
      <li>Easy to carry when I travel.</li>
      <li>and it still is going strong.</li>
      <li>It functions to my expectations and is fine for brow trimming.</li>
      <li>The one I am replacing with this one is the exact same model that has been working flawlessly for 10 years.</li>
      <li>quick trims over the ears (and yes, those ear and nose hairs that seem to sprout overnight!).</li>
      <li>Lightweight, great for light duty trimming of ear, nose, eyebrows, back of neck.  </li>
      <li>In fact, my primary use for this trimmer now is as an eyebrow trimmer.</li>
      <li>For only 8 dollars it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
      <li>cut me and was too cheaply made to keep using.</li>
      <li>I primarily use these to keep my eyebrows in check and they are fantastic.</li>
      <li>I would have returned this if the cost of shipping wasn&#x27;t more than the thing is worth.</li>
      <li>Good for old guys where hair emerges in the darnest places.</li>
      <li>He said they worked better than any he had bought including much higher priced one.</li>
      <li>Ordered this one for my brother who had been using his first since he tried mine and thought it much better than the one he had.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Seems to do a good job.. not entirely painless, but it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>so you need to handle it with care when you disassemble it to clean it.</li>
      <li>You have to take it apart to clean it</li>
      <li>After a drop of 3 in 1 oil and a piece of aluminum foil on the positive tip of the battery to make sure it is snug</li>
      <li>It was great to use at first, especially trimming my puebes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My rechargeable shaving kit finally went kaput, and I bought a new beard trimmer.  Unfortunately the one I bought doesn&#x27;t have the option to change into a nose hair trimmer, so I bought one of these for a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately I noticed that the tip was slightly out of shape.  Even making sure the plastic clip was locked in place, I found that the tip would come apart easily.  The motor seems to run at inconsistent speeds, even with a brand new battery.  Both of these defects made it very difficult, if not impossible to use the device properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good item in theory, but poor construction and low quality materials hinder its function.  Spend a few more dollars and buy a better model.  I had the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] and used the nose hair trimmer attachment and it worked great.  And the price is not too bad.  I&#x27;m going back to the better model.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and have been using them for years and now passing them onto family and friends, would recommend them</li>
    <li> I have another brand that I was happy with so I tried the Conair product.    It has 2 blades, small &amp; larger, and is wide enough so I can use the additional head with the blade.I have a beard &amp; moustache and it did a great job on it.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this, but it didn&#x27;t cut my hair and it didn&#x27;t cut my sons hair (beard, nose hairs, ear hairs.)  My old micro touch was far better, but the reviews for the new lighted one were not very good so I tried the Con Air.  After being disappointed with the Con Air, I bought one of the new micro touches.  It works as well as my older model (though I don&#x27;t know if the battery will last as long on the new model because of the new unnecessary light.)  Hope this helps your decision.</li>
    <li> This cutter works pretty well for nose hairs, ear hairs, eyebrows and other unwanted hairs. I would not groom my body with this, but for the smaller jobs it works just fine and I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was a horrible dud. It never trimmed a single hair as it ran for 1 second and died. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This was not a very good purchase. I you are looking for a trimer look at something else.</li>
    <li> To date I have not been able to find a better tool for trimming eyebrows.  Most men&#x27;s trimmers are designed with the goal of *removing* hair from unwanted areas like noses, ears, etc.  However, that simply won&#x27;t do for eyebrows.  This tool makes trimming those rogue eyebrow hairs super fast and super easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool operates on a single AAA battery and has a simple plastic guard that can be set for one of two lengths.  One or two quick swipes and wild eyebrows are once again tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the bargain price of ~$12 each, I own two of these- one for home and one for travel.  The entire device is about as think as a man&#x27;s finger and about twice as long.  To put it another way, it is smaller than most toothbrush cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that I consider this tool exclusively for use on eyebrows despite the fact that it&#x27;s marketed as a multi-use tool, which is why I give it only 4 out of 5 stars.  Using the guard renders it effectively useless for noses and ears because it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough for my tastes.  However, using it without the guard can lead to some painful moments- the blades *will* snag you without the guard.  For nose and ear trimming, I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B0002D5Y92 Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, if your eyebrows tend to get a little long do yourself a favour and pick one of these up.</li>
    <li> This product died after one use.  I was hoping it would last a little longer.  It says not to use in room with mositure but who would use this in a room besides your bathroom.  Come on!  Save your money and do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> excellent--does what it claims great for men and women/travel/camp home elderly--ez handling etc</li>
    <li> I have purchased 10 or 15 of these devices over the last 6 years.  They are basically disposable like a razor after a few uses.  I don&#x27;t know what happens to them...they just stop working.      I use them mainly for nostril hair and specifically for the thickest hairiest area just inside the front of my nose.  When they&#x27;re new they work great and I&#x27;ve not found any other grooming device that can do as fine of a job.  However after several uses they just stop working.  I&#x27;ve tried new batteries, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be what fails.  I can pop out the old battery and put it back in and sometimes the device will start working again. Banging them on the countertop sometimes gets them to rev up again, but eventually they just stop working.</li>
    <li> The second generation trimmer packs a stronger motor and seems to last longer.  This unit only comes with one blade guard where the first generation came with two.  I&#x27;ve not had any of the problems that other people have complained about with this unit and I have thick black hair.  Replacing the battery when the motors slows down seems like a simple, cheap solution to prevent the pulling you will feel when the battery runs down.</li>
    <li> I bought this and used it 3 or 4 times, and then it came apart. I liked how it worked, so I ended up taping it back together. But the plastic parts don&#x27;t hold up very well. But then, it is very inexpensive, and wasn&#x27;t worth the bother of returning. That said, it works very well on nose hairs and ear hairs. But I find that the guard for using when cutting your eyebrow hair is useless. It won&#x27;t let you get a close enough clipping to make any difference. The only thing it will cut is extremely long hairs like you see on some actors. You know the type, they look like they have a mini beard instead of eyebrows. The hair is about one to two inches long. But I like mine much shorter, and for that this is useless. But it does an excellent job with nose hair, without pulling. Though you do need to be patient. I found that using a flashlight increases the ease of cutting hairs a great deal. Just using a mirror makes cutting difficult. It is just too bad that it fell apart and had to be taped together to work. If not for that, I would have ordered a new one. But I don&#x27;t want to buy another one that has to be taped together. If not for the falling apart, I would have given it four stars, knocked one off for the taping together, and another for the useless eyebrow trimmer.</li>
    <li> Purchased this trimmer to replace a Remington that the tabs to hold it closed broke off. This Conair was less expensive and so far I have been very pleased.</li>
    <li> This brand seems to be the only brand I can get to last any length of time. I couldn&#x27;t find the women&#x27;s trimmer anymore, so I bought this one. It&#x27;s the same thing just a different color.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my man for a Birthday gift. He really enjoys using this product and no longer uses my trimmer.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t too much to say about these. It does what you need it to/what it says it can do (not much else... don&#x27;t try). What it says it can do, it does well. Battery seems to last a while, but I guess I don&#x27;t use it too often.     It feels cheap, but for the price it is hard to beat. I&#x27;ve found other options may be a bit sturdier but cost more than double. Eventually those die too.     Do NOT use for manscaping. If that is what you are looking for spend a little extra on this: [[ASIN:B001E0C9LI Philips Norelco BG2030 BodyGroom]]. This thing does what it says it will (which is very different than the Conair trimmer) and it was specifically designed for manscaping.</li>
    <li> Aside from the fact that this tickles my nose mercilessly, it&#x27;s ineffective. I&#x27;ll select one hair to go after and then settle in for the contest. Who will win? Will the hair be able to defeat the whirring Conair Trimmer monster? Get some popcorn and watch! Don&#x27;t worry--you&#x27;ll have time to eat that popcorn. Most times the trimmer comes in contact with the hair, the hair cleverly just bends out of the way. It may take a dozen attempts before the trimmer finally chops the hair off. Then we can start a new battle over the next hair. Usually several hairs escape demise as their owner has a bus to catch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m inclined to try one of the trimmers with a cylindrical rotating tip rather than this one that works like microscopic hedge trimmers. Hmm. Now that I think about it, maybe I&#x27;ll try the hedge trimmer!</li>
    <li> Spend $3 more and get the Remington PG-165... you&#x27;ll be glad you did.  Every time I use this trimmer it falls apart into 3 pieces and I have to put it back together again.  The blade / motor is weak and struggles to do a good job.  This thing is very cheap and it&#x27;s a case of you get what you pay for....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps you avoid my mistake!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years now. Several things have broken, like the on-off switch head (I&#x27;ve to stick in a scissor blade or something to push it up and down), and one of the prongs that attach to the head (when the other one goes I&#x27;ll have to throw it out), and it leaks battery (so I have to take the battery out out after using). It is also a little difficult to clean and put back together. But for about $6 odd, this does the job very well (I use it on nose and ear hair), and I cant complain. I have tried other tools in the $10-12 range, but they didnt work at all.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these low cost nose trimmers for over a year. Many different names on the same product; mine said Remington. For the last six months I have had to hold it together with my fingers to use it.  Only useful if you are planning to replace it in a few weeks. It actually works quite well during the weeks it functions. Manufacturing cost must be on the order of 7 cents and a sad example of China design and manufacturing skills...  Spend a little more and you will save in the long run.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer &amp; tried it out &amp; was very satisfied with it&#x27;s performance &amp; the ease of how it operated</li>
    <li> I have had this unit for at least 6 years and it works great for trimming ear, nose, and eyebrows. Only issue is the power cuts out or the blade slows way down at times.  I was on Amazon looking for a replacement when another reviewer mentioned a similar problem with a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by his success I decided to take mine apart and give it a good cleaning.  After a drop of 3 in 1 oil and a piece of aluminum foil on the positive tip of the battery to make sure it is snug it is running great.  Speed of the blade is almost double and the power isn&#x27;t cutting out even when shaking it.  Hopefully it will remain this way for another 6 years.  I think a combination of debris causing too much friction and a cheap battery housing assembly was the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like all these cheap trimmers have similar issues so hopefully manufacturers make a higher quality unit but with the same design.  I think most men are willing to spend double the cost of this unit to get a high quality rechargeable unit even though it would only cost an extra couple of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will let you know if the old problems come back.</li>
    <li> Great little gadget,Thanks A+</li>
    <li> Blade does not trim hair as well as other trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have no complaints about it. It is able to be used ANYWHERE and it DOES NOT cut you. AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> Good for old guys where hair emerges in the darnest places. Shaving area is small but does the job on ears and eyebrows.</li>
    <li> fell apart after 2nd use - was able to repair  but will not buy another one</li>
    <li> Lightweight, great for light duty trimming of ear, nose, eyebrows, back of neck.  Great price also, would recommend for light duty trimming.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed to trim in hard to reach crevices where other trimmers couldn&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a lot better than usual ones found at Target etc.</li>
    <li> If you have thicker hair, this thing is useless and won&#x27;t cut hardly anything - it *does* yank hair out though, one by one. As the battery wears down, it slows to a crawl. Don&#x27;t bother trying to trim those \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas - despite advertisements otherwise, it WILL draw blood if you use it without the guard. I would totally return this thing if it hadn&#x27;t been so cheap in the first place, so I&#x27;ll probably just throw it away.</li>
    <li> Replacement for an older similar Conair product.  Especially good for ear and nose hair that is out of control.  Attachments more for ladies eyebrown trimming, and that gets in the way of my application just a bit, otherwise it would have gotten a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 years, and the blade has finally dulled enough that I need a replacement trimmer. Considering the relatively low price, I think 2 years to replace is reasonable. I&#x27;m now ordering this again. I use this for my nose and ears. It&#x27;s been just what I need. It is relatively manueverable and works well. I&#x27;ve NEVER had an issue with it \\&quot;drawing blood\\&quot; as some other reviewers have mentioned. I also don&#x27;t understand why at least one reviewer here complained about the device \\&quot;slowing to a crawl\\&quot; when the battery gets low... um.. REALLY? .... (???). Replace the battery maybe?????? 1+1 &#x3D; 2???? It does seem to have difficulty with thicker hairs, but with a little creative manuevering, it&#x27;s been sufficient (although not ideal) for that occasional coarse hair.</li>
    <li> cut me and was too cheaply made to keep using.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for almost 5 years before it broke, so I just ordered another one.  5 years is really good considering I use it a few times per week for my nose, ears and eyebrows.  It even has a little adapter that you can use for your eyebrows.  Love these things and they battery last for a long, long time as well.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> does noit seem to do its job</li>
    <li> Ok trimmer, teeth are not long enough (like the Braun trimmer) so it doesn&#x27;t trim too close to the skin.  I&#x27;ve purchased several brands over the years, this one is middle of the pack.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer for the bikini area there is. Gentle and works great</li>
    <li> Eh, I used it twice and its already broken. I only have like 10 hairs it try to get. NO</li>
    <li> had one of these a few years ago and finally wore it out...bought this one to replace it and it&#x27;s an excellent trimmer.</li>
    <li> Convienent, small and easily handled. Just what I was looking for. Would strongly recommend for a tidy shaver. Works Great!!</li>
    <li> Had a Remington one like this and it worked great for over 2 years. Used it to shape up the back of my hairline in between cuts. This one barely takes any hair off.</li>
    <li> This little gadget, which is cheap, will painlessly keep the hairs in your nose from becoming the hairs hanging out of your nose.  Don&#x27;t expect more, that&#x27;s what it does.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I own.  I keep one in my travel bag when traveling internationally, and ordered another one for home as it&#x27;s just simpler and more reliable than other similar products I&#x27;ve purchased.  Great for those quick male grooming needs, like preventing the scary Larry Hagman eyebrows, quick trims over the ears (and yes, those ear and nose hairs that seem to sprout overnight!). Battery life is good (and AAA&#x27;s are readily available anywhere), it&#x27;s lightweight, cleaning is easy with the brush incorporated inside, and it&#x27;s compact (about the size of a Sharpie marker).  I consider it an essential must have for staying groomed on the road and at home.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great for keeping your moustache hairs neat and out of the way. Safer than scissors; this won&#x27;t cut your lips off! The small blade is ideal for precision trimming is small areas (e.g. under the nose and around the mouth). The large blade is good for making neat edges along the lip and outline of the beard. The comb is a bit long for beard trimming if your going for that \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; look; still it is good for keeping the beard and moustache from getting too long. Using the short comb and brushing against the direction of hair growth can give a trim close to a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I haven&#x27;t really found a use for the long comb other than maybe as an eyebrow trimmer. It&#x27;s a high-drain device so battery life can be poor; the unit has been known to slow down after less than a dozen uses. It&#x27;s sharp and still cuts even when the blade has slowed down. Just makes sure the battery you put in it is a fresh, new battery. It&#x27;s very compact--about the size of a mascara tube. I have seen these as low as $7; WELL worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this trimmer for some time, I&#x27;d like to add that I earlier understated the value of this as an eyebrow trimmer. Using the long trimmer edge with the short comb attached in the groove that gives the lowest setting, this is a GREAT eyebrow trimmer. If you have bushy eyebrows (as I tend to if I don&#x27;t groom them), this is an invaluable tool. In fact, my primary use for this trimmer now is as an eyebrow trimmer. I find it works MUCH BETTER as an eyebrow trimmer than even as a moustache trimmer. The black one is the men&#x27;s unit; the pink one is the women&#x27;s unit. Other than the color, they are identical so this works great as an eyebrow trimmer for both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: July 2012. After 5 years of use, I finally managed to ruin it. The clip that holds the blades in place is thin plastic so you need to handle it with care when you disassemble it to clean it. I had bent a clip too far and broke it. Surprisingly, I manage to push the clip back in place and the trimmer worked as normal for another couple of months. I tried to disassemble it to clean the hair out of it once again and accidentally dropped one of the blades down the bathroom sink drain. So after 5 years of use, this trimmer still worked perfectly EVEN AFTER I had snapped the internal plastic clip that holds the blade in place. In the end, I killed it by losing a part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this simple trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it were lost or stolen (or if I dropped the blade down the sink), I&#x27;d get another one as soon as possible.Surprisingly, I manage to push the clip back in place and the trimmer worked as normal for another couple of months.

    <li> We have to look sexy too.  Women dont want to date the Wolf man.  Buy this and use for eyebrows only, Perfect results.     Buy a seperate unit for nose and ear if needed.</li>
    <li> Been using Conair men&#x27;s trimmer for several years. I purchase a new one when the blades get dull, about a year later. Never had any problems with them.</li>
    <li> I went to use this for the SECOND use and it wouldn&#x27;t start.  Changed batteries, same deal. The one we had worked for years and this one worked for a day. Terrible product, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product, I bought similar in the past and they all sounded cheap, this one sounds like a weed wacker so it has to be tough.</li>
    <li> Good value and product.</li>
    <li> Trims my stuff. Cleans well batteries last a long time. Not much more to say except for five more words</li>
    <li> Worked for a week and then stopped. I tried changing the battery, but nothing worked to bring it back. It wasn&#x27;t that great at trimming hair anyway. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years, works great!</li>
    <li> Hubby uses it for nose and ear trims, I use it for annoying chin hairs or moustache.  Great!</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I have ever bought. The one I am replacing with this one is the exact same model that has been working flawlessly for 10 years. I have cut ever hair on my body and my wife&#x27;s at least once with this trimmer and it still is going strong. But I&#x27;m worried about old faithful.getting dull for some delicate areas finally after 10 years. Hence , the new one.</li>
    <li> This item only lasts a short period of time and you will find yourself replacing it quickly.  Mine only lasted about 6 months and it just fails to turn on even after putting in a fresh battery.  I opened it up and blew it out too to make sure nothing was jamming, but it is a rather simple device and it was to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of replacing this model with an equally crappy model (but in metal) and that one has now failed as well.  Actually the replacement one I bought had a cutter that was cylindrical shaped vs. the cutters being exposed like in this model.  I did find that the cylindrical shaped cutter did not tickle the inside of my nose as much as the cutters did in this model.  So maybe slightly less crappy, but still failed in about 6 months as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my recommendation is to stay away from these trimmers that look like pens - especially the ones with the exposed cutters because they all seem to be crappy and only last a short while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give it 2 stars though because it does trim your nose hairs.  You will however be tickled by it while cutting, and it will fail to work within 6 months.  If you are okay with that then go ahead and purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still looking for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my hair stylist. He said they worked better than any he had bought including much higher priced one. He uses them for ears and eyebrow areas. Said the edge on them made it easier than other styles. Priced good.</li>
    <li> Very nice and easy to use.  Like the trim feature on second blade.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, received it today and did not work. Whoever shipped this please get in touch with me so I may send it back and receive another one that does work.</li>
    <li> Have used two of these trimmers myself until both lived their lifetime. Both performed and lasted well beyond what I would have expected. This trimmer is shaped perfectly for me. Ordered this one for my brother who had been using his first since he tried mine and thought it much better than the one he had. The shape is good for close trimming of nose hairs that might stray into sight as well as moustache touch-up and any scraggly ear hairs that are unsightly. Built very well and lasts a long time. A quality product and on Amazon, a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a nice trimmer for men. It can be used to trim hair around the ears or in them.  It&#x27;s small enough to trim nose hairs.  It has a guard on it for use when trimming eye brows.  It is battery powered and very compact.  I noticed that it required a few passes on trimming up my husbands hairline around his ears.  So, the blades are fairly good.  The kit could be improved by including replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Could not live w/out this unit!!</li>
    <li> Works great, I use it once a week to trim my beard, it&#x27;s perfect! For only 8 dollars it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> the  trimmer didnot work as soon as i put the battery in. tried  other batteries and still didnot work.&lt;br /&gt;in the garbage</li>
    <li> works good to tighten up around the back of my neck between hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now, and it&#x27;s still on the same battery and going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also comes with a little brush built into the handle, which is nice for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend.</li>
    <li> This broke on me before I even used it.</li>
    <li> Cuts off, junk junk junk the battery connection is just a tinny wire and spring. The Remington I had lasted for years.</li>
    <li> It will cut facial hair only if you go VERY slowly. If you don&#x27;t it pulls and hurts. The cutting blades jam up and then separate, disconnecting from the motor. You have to take it apart to clean it and there are little tiny plastic pieces that are easily lost... and it doesn&#x27;t work without them (why i&#x27;m writing this). don&#x27;t buy this</li>
    <li> I had a pink version of this for over 10 years, and it just now broke. I didn&#x27;t use it often, but when it always worked well when I did. The streamlined and efficient design really makes it nice to own and store.</li>
    <li> This works fine, but the older models cut hair much closer. The cheapest one you could find would work just as well.</li>
    <li> Thanks, I love it, that is  that I was looking for. I realy recomend this Item. It is very ease to use.</li>
    <li> Make great stocking stufers!</li>
    <li> Works great. Lasts a long time. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Alas, now that I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties, the hair on my head is dissipating while new, novel hair has begun growing where it shouldn&#x27;t.  Fortunately, this little guy is terrific for managing those errant arrivals. Nose, ears, and eyebrows especially, but it&#x27;s also a great way to keep sideburns and the neckline clean between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; nose hair trimmer with the circular blades, but this is much more versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to go with a full-size body trimmer if you need to do any landscaping south of the head and neck, though.</li>
    <li> I would have returned this if the cost of shipping wasn&#x27;t more than the thing is worth. The trimmer is good as a prop for a barber shop movie..... If you plan on using it for real.....keep shopping!</li>
    <li> Very good, no problem using it.it cut clean and fast. Easy to carry when I travel. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this little thing bought three of them just to have and to take everywhere i can bring it. It does the smallest of jobs without the cuts very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I primarily use these to keep my eyebrows in check and they are fantastic. Excellent value for the price. I also like the fact that the eyebrow attachment is able to be stored under the small black top rather than having to keep up with it separately.</li>
    <li> Seems to dull rather quickly</li>
    <li> Love these little guys. Don&#x27;t move it real fast though</li>
    <li> I really like this little trimmer.  Be careful with it because it is fragile but works great if you are gentle with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different ones, this particular brand seems to be of better quality and I expect it to last longer than the other cheaper built models I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> No other trimmer will cut it (no pun intended!) with my husband.  He&#x27;s tried other types, and we keep coming back to this one.  It&#x27;s simple to use, and doesn&#x27;t pull like some other models.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It was decent, however I would go for something more durable.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review after 1 year. This is a very high quality product and works perfect. Blades are good in quality and works smooth. I will do business with this seller again. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Product is good. It has a small angled head like the Norelco but with twin cutting blades and uses a AA battery instead of the normal AAA so it powerful, never bogs down.</li>
    <li> bought it for a friend, and he loved it ! thank you</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but thought this was worthwhile... for such an inexpensive device for eyebrow/ear/nose hair trimming, there is an unexpected difference to tell you about! I had this trimmer once before, excellent long life especially since they have some plastic components within the moving parts. I&#x27;ve used it almost daily for years until it recently failed (because while cleaning the little blades I clumsily dropped it on the tile and damaged some parts).&lt;br /&gt;Walmart didn&#x27;t carry it anymore so I bought a WAHL model, very similar looking &amp;#34;trimmer stick&amp;#34; design. Tried the WAHL, and instantly thought I would go deaf when bringing it near my ears; very high-pitched loud screaming noise! Loud enough to really bother me when doin those butt-ugly hairs that try to appear within and around the ears... once you start to carefully rotate it into the ear slightly it was too much to bear.  SO; I found this Conair model again on Amazon, very happy to be able to get the same one again! Just got it yesterday, so I put a battery in, turned em both on and held one by each ear, and the Conair is SO much quieter than the WAHL, not even close to it&#x27;s shrill whine.&lt;br /&gt;So, 5 stars from me, especially for this low price point, the Conair travels easily with the solid metal body &amp; cap, it lasts a LONG time one a AAA battery, and the first one worked for years before I basically busted it!&lt;br /&gt;*My tip; after each use I run it under very hot water for a sec or two, to get any oils, hairs or &amp;#34;nose essence&amp;#34; off the blades. I also occasionally turn it on and spray a product called &amp;#34;Remington Shaver Saver&amp;#34; across the cutting blades (you can find that at Walmart in a spray container near the shaver products), run it a sec or two then wipe it off with a Kleenex and yer good ta go! For this price and to last this long and work so well it&#x27;s a no brainer!  Thanks for reading-&lt;br /&gt;Marty Moose</li>
    <li> runs so slow that it stops running. it is the worst i have ever had in all my life. junk!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried other clippers and this one is the best for cutting hair in your nose. I received my order is less than 5 days.</li>
    <li> I purchase one of these every year as they get dull after a while.  It functions to my expectations and is fine for brow trimming.</li>
    <li> As expected for battery operated trimmer</li>
    <li> It was great to use at first, especially trimming my puebes. Then it just started sporadically stopping. Go with a better brand for a few bucks more.</li>
    <li> Painlessly gets the nose hair, but these things don&#x27;t last forever. I&#x27;ve been through about 6 of them over the years.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after a few days. Wish I could return this item!!</li>
    <li> Not as well made as I had expected it to be.  I have owned better cutters.</li>
    <li> My son loves these trimmer and I love the dealer. The trimmers work great on his beard, ear trimming and even his nose hairs. I have to buy him one about once a year. He really wears these thing out.</li>
    <li> I opened the package, put in a brand new battery and nothing. I tried the battery in my other trimmer and it worked. It doesnt seem to be made very well. my old one had some weight to it and lasted almost ten years. This one is a plastic cheapy version that didnt even work.</li>
    <li> Works better than Remington or Micro Touch, both of which I have used in the past.  Appears to be of better quality and fitment.</li>
    <li> What I like: You can get a good trim with this product. It will not cut or cause abrasion. I purchased one of these trimmers several years ago. I use it at least once a week and the blades are still as sharp as the first day I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: The blade section falls off occasionally, but is easy to reattach.</li>
    <li> Worked at first but not after some months it has a hard time to turn on.  You have to take it a part after using and make sure everything is cleaned and then put it back together and even then had a hard time starting.  Would have to take it a part and start it without the blade in and then put it back together and hope it would start.</li>
    <li> Seems to do a good job.. not entirely painless, but it&#x27;s fine.  And I like the size and shape.. travels well.</li>
    <li> Fast ship. I use it weekly and find it easy to use and trouble free</li>
    <li> I got one of these for my mother several years ago. It took quite a while for the blades to dull with regular use on eyebrows. I just got her another one when she mentioned how much she missed it.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite products</li>
    <li> A little flimsy.  Remington makes as better one!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for - works perfectly.</li>
    <li> out of the box this thing would fall apart; the grey interior part would slip out of the black part (see pics), so I would have to secure it with my hand while using it. After 4 weeks, the blade front part containing the blade started falling off, and would not stay attached for more than 5 seconds while running. Summary: complete garbage, it takes the honor of probably being one of the worst products I ever bought. Any $10 Walgreens trimmer is a &amp;#34;Made in Germany Quality Product&amp;#34; compared to this, and I will probably go back to the Walgreens trimmers; at least they last a year or so</li>
