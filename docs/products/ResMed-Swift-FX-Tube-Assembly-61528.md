    <li> Arrived quickly and works fine</li>
    <li> Well needed replacement.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for older Swift FX assembly</li>
    <li> Perfect match,  works exactly like the other one.  Priced a little high, but when you need a hose..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if i need a future hose, i will certainly be looking elsewhere first because of price,  however if no where else is available, ResMed did deliver fast.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, fast shipping great!!!!</li>
    <li> I prefer this method over the mask attachment as it allows me to use the nasal pillows over the ears, which doesn&#x27;t pull my hair.  It&#x27;s easy to disassemble and clean.  I just dry it as best I can, then attach it to the machine and turn it on for a few minutes before I put it on.  That helps &amp;#34;blow dry&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!</li>

    <li> This one of those things where somthing works or it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;This works, seems to be well made, is simple to clean, what else can I say?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the local health at home store or your hospital. Perfect replacement part here at 1/3 the price of the medical suppliers and &amp;#34;wholesalers&amp;#34;.</li>
