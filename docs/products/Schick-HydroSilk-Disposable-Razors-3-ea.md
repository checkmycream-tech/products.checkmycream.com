      <li>Anyways, It helps you achieve a close shave, it  hydrates  the skin during and after shaving, you can reuse it many times,</li>
      <li>With applying the shaving gel made the shaving process quick and easy plus it smells good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good to be a disposable razor..</li>
      <li>They do a great job shaving smooth surfaces thanks to the 5 blades and aloe strip.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE how smooth my legs feel.  </li>
      <li>hair easily-</li>
      <li>I was ready to give up until I received a pack of these babies FREE from a lovely site called Bzzagent where I was asked in return to give my honest review.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different shaving creams and razors in my life, but I would have to say the combination of the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razors and the Skintimate® Skin Therapy Silky Skin Shave Gel is absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>It has a uniquely curved shaped handle that helps for a easy gliding effect while shaving.</li>
      <li>I have no cuts and smooth legs.</li>
      <li>I got them free to try from Bzzagent and i</li>
      <li>I gave this razor four stars because of the fact that it made my leg bleed and even when I used a lot of shaving cream the razor didn&#x27;t glide as smooth as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>It just leaves you feeling silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I got this razor free as a brand promotion from BuzzAgent.</li>
      <li>so i can be comfortable when i travel and not have to feel like i am compromising for what trAvel products are  avalable or have to try to transport mine from home and wrap it for travel some how they work wonderes</li>
      <li>Worth spending more money up front to get them in bulk.</li>
      <li>It allows for a clean close shave each time it is used.</li>
      <li>i am so glad that thanks to shick  </li>
      <li>But for a disposable razor, this is for sure in the top 2 out of the many, and I mean MANY, disposable razors I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it was worth it to get the clean shave, smoothness, and moisture it provided.</li>
      <li>I shaved two days ago and my skin still feel really soft, so much better than when I use the cheap no name brand razors.</li>
      <li>First, I want to thank Schick and BzzAgent for letting me try this product for free,</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the overall design of this razor.</li>
      <li>This razor has 5 blades and make for a very close shave and of course the moisturizing strip leaves skin super silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>It really did leave my legs feel silky smooth for days afterwards.</li>
      <li>That really makes a HUGE difference.  </li>
      <li>I got to try them for free thanks to Schick and Bzzagent.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>They even feel worth it when in the hand, all ergonomic and grippy.</li>
      <li>Other than that problem I loved the grip and the fact that it have 5 blades..</li>
      <li>I did nick both my legs, right under my knees.  </li>
      <li>, it makes it easy to hold and comfortable for daily use if you need it.</li>
      <li>I recently was able to try the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors for free thanks to Schick and was amazed by the razor.</li>
      <li>It was actually  moisturized and very smooth.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I would  have purchased  these if I didn&#x27;t  get them from Bzzagent  first</li>
      <li>My legs are so soft and smooth without having to put any additional lotion on.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it the only reason why I did not give it 5 stars</li>
      <li>but after trying out my complimentary shavers from @BzzAgent, they make it so much easier to get close to the skin</li>
      <li>The first time I used the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables</li>
      <li>I have been using my first one a couple months now</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know that a razor could make such a huge difference in my shaving.</li>
      <li>It really shaved close and got all the hairs.</li>
      <li>Using them was effortless and i get through the routine really fast</li>
      <li>Thanks to the number of blades</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used a razor that plays well with my eczema, but this one absolutely does.</li>
      <li>I am the type of girl that would much prefer to wear pants than to shave my legs...</li>
      <li>if I had a dollar  for every time I wore pants because shaving is way too much work....</li>
      <li>I also really like the handle design.</li>
      <li>But overall this is a razor I feel comfortable using.</li>
      <li>On the days that I shave, I noticed that I don&#x27;t need to apply as much lotion to my legs.  </li>
      <li>The razors are light and the lube strip definitely helps glide the razor across my legs and hands.</li>
      <li>This is important because i have really long legs and shaving can take a while.</li>
      <li>I always exfoliate first and also use shaving cream for sensitive skin which helps as well.</li>

    <li> i am so glad that thanks to shick  i have been able to try these razors for free they are the best disposable razors that i have ever tried its just like the non disposable  so i can be comfortable when i travel and not have to feel like i am compromising for what trAvel products are  avalable or have to try to transport mine from home and wrap it for travel some how they work wonderes and i get a very good shave i would also recommend the skintiment shave cream as well</li>
    <li> Why you should buy Schick Hydro Silk Disposables?  First, I want to thank Schick and BzzAgent for letting me try this product for free,however everything I&#x27;m about to say is my honest opinion. Anyways, It helps you achieve a close shave, it  hydrates  the skin during and after shaving, you can reuse it many times, it&#x27;s affordable, the handle and cartridge design facilitates shaving in those hard to reach places and the design lets you have control over the area you are shaving unlike other razors I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! Why? Because I don&#x27;t get razor burn. With my old razor I would get it even though I am an expert at shaving after all these years. Thanks to the number of blades the close shave it gives I don&#x27;t get razor burn and I also find I don&#x27;t have to shave again the next day. My biggest dilemma is I have coarse hair that tends to grow back fairly quickly but I didn&#x27;t have that next day fuzz that I&#x27;ve dealt with all these years. It&#x27;s great because it helps save time in the shower for me. No more shaving every day! I can go every other day now. It just leaves you feeling silky smooth. The handle grip is nice as well. I don&#x27;t like flat handles that are hard to grip. The curve makes it easier, especially when you&#x27;re shaving in those hard to reach areas and you need a little bit of movement to get everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this razor to review from Bzz Agent. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I am the type of girl that would much prefer to wear pants than to shave my legs... but after trying out my complimentary shavers from @BzzAgent, they make it so much easier to get close to the skin (yay, not cuts!). I always have a hard time getting my ankles and knees, but the flexible shaver head makes it easy to contour around those places. It&#x27;s also not huge like some other shaver brands, so it&#x27;s easier to handle. The moisturizing strip on the shaver adds extra moisture for extended periods of smoothness. I #GotItFree from BzzAgent and Schick, Thank you for letting me try a great product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables! I got them free to try from Bzzagent and im so glad I did. Using them was effortless and i get through the routine really fast and there were no cuts or scratches. This is important because i have really long legs and shaving can take a while. My skin wasnt dry afterwards. It was actually  moisturized and very smooth. The razors get all of those little stubborn hairs that drive us crazy, This is going to be my new brand.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors are one of the only brands of razors I will purchase.  I can always get a close shave and I never worry about cutting myself even when I get into a rush.  I really like the soft grip comfort handle, it makes it easy to hold and comfortable for daily use if you need it. These razors also store well in my shower, even if I am very diligent about keeping my razor blades free of nicks they still tend to rust quickly due to the hard water I have at home, but these razors seem to last a bit longer than most razors I have used and even with daily uses.  I can almost always grab a good deal on these when I&#x27;m out shopping or even on line because of the coupons that are available, making this razor one of my top choices when it comes to body care management.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of this product by the company for quality reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables for free to try, and I am in LOVE!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE how smooth my legs feel.  Before using the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables , I would need to shave every single day.  The Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables give me such a close shave that I only need to shave every other day now. That really makes a HUGE difference.  My legs not only feel extra smooth because of the close shave, but they also feel so hydrated.  On the days that I shave, I noticed that I don&#x27;t need to apply as much lotion to my legs.  I&#x27;ve also noticed less painful bumps around my bikini area.  So how could I not LOVE these new razors. The first time I used the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables I did nick both my legs, right under my knees.  I wasn&#x27;t too happy about that, but these new razors are very sharp and I was so used to a dull razor that I needed to apply a lot of pressure to.  I now apply less pressure and haven&#x27;t had a problem a since. I also really like the handle design. Not sure the benefits of this new design, but it almost feels easier to hold the razor and easier mange while shaving. I would highly recommend the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables! I plan on purchasing these razor in the future.</li>
    <li> I got this razor for free to try it and LOVED it. I have no cuts and smooth legs. I didn&#x27;t know that a razor could make such a huge difference in my shaving. It didnt take me as long to shave, I had less areas to go back and reshave and my legs were super smooth after. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this razor. I leaves my legs so soft and smooth,&lt;br /&gt;#buzzagent #tryit #itsfree</li>
    <li> Great product. I got a free trial from Schick along with shaving cream and a loofa and have really enjoyed the smoothness and hydration the razor leaves behind. It does not run out of the moisturizing belt as quickly as razors I have used in the past. My only complaint is that I had to wash it out pretty frequently but it was worth it to get the clean shave, smoothness, and moisture it provided.</li>
    <li> I recently was able to try the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors for free thanks to Schick and was amazed by the razor. The Hydro Silk razor actually provides hydration while shaving and for hours after shaving. It allows for a clean close shave each time it is used. It has a uniquely curved shaped handle that helps for a easy gliding effect while shaving. I had no skin irritation while using this razor which I sometimes get from using other razors. I am loving the results of the razor and have no grievances toward the product itself. If I had to point out a negative of the razor it would be the price. It retails around ten dollars which is a little steep in my book, but it is worth the cost. #GotItFree #Joyineveryshave #hooked #love #myhonestopinion</li>
    <li> if I had a dollar  for every time I wore pants because shaving is way too much work.... these razors  take the hassle out of shaVing by mosturizing as you go and bending with your curves. I can&#x27;t say I would  have purchased  these if I didn&#x27;t  get them from Bzzagent  first but  now I don&#x27;t wanna buy anything  else</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these razors. I got to try them for free thanks to Schick and Bzzagent. The moisturizing ring around the blades are so heavenly and made my legs feel like silk. literally. Thank you Schick for making a disposable razor that doesn&#x27;t feel like one.</li>
    <li> I love this product I usually don&#x27;t splurge on my razors being that they are disposable and I have to continuously buy some. I tried this razor via Bzz agent and I absolutely love it the only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that I was not aware that the water activated moisturizing strip would leak all over my bath tub. But, if you keep it in them in a dry place when they are not being used you should not have that problem. This razor has 5 blades and make for a very close shave and of course the moisturizing strip leaves skin super silky and smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the overall design of this razor. It&#x27;s sleek, equipped with moisture strips, and the five blades leave an extra lasting smooth feeling that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different shaving creams and razors in my life, but I would have to say the combination of the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razors and the Skintimate® Skin Therapy Silky Skin Shave Gel is absolutely amazing! I received these from BzzAgent. My legs are so soft and smooth without having to put any additional lotion on. I would definitely recommend using the combo together! #HydroSilkDisposables @Skintimate #GotItFree @BzzAgent</li>
    <li> This razor worked great and the price was right for a disposable.  I also like that they deliver it to my door.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price was right and I am happy with these disposable shavers.</li>
    <li> I was happy to try out #SchickHydroSilk and I have to say the product is great! The razor shaving my legs made it an ease especially on the knees and on the curves from the back that I usually have difficulty when using another razor product. With applying the shaving gel made the shaving process quick and easy plus it smells good. The only complaint I got which isn&#x27;t a big deal but when washing off the razor the moisturizer comes off too. But overall this is a razor I feel comfortable using. Thank you #Bzzagent and #ShickHydroSilk for letting me join the campaign and for receiving 3 #SchickHydroSilk razors, skintimate skin therapy shaving gel, bath sponge and some coupons to get more of these! #GotitFree</li>
    <li> So, I have been using this razor now for a few weeks. I must say, I am still madly in love with the skintimate shave gel, it is amazing! I love the hydration it provides me, especially with having very dry skin, yuck. I still will give the shick hydro silk disposable a 4 star out of 5. I think they are great, the first shave was amazing. The second, I got a bit of knicks from it and some razor burn which kinda stunk. I would say, when it comes to optimal performance with the hydration moisturizing strips, they are 100% for about 3 uses, after that, they start to wear off. About the 4th or 5th shave from this razor I was getting quite a bit more razor burn from it. But for a disposable razor, this is for sure in the top 2 out of the many, and I mean MANY, disposable razors I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DISCLAIMER-- I recieved this product for free from Shick in return for a fair and honest review of the product.</li>
    <li> Received it from bzzagent and honestly couldn&#x27;t be any happier with the result. My legs have always been dry but hair free(or hairy and smooth), even if i use lotion. But the razor along with the cream shaving gel have fixed that problem, i highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this pack of razors for free from buzz agent and I was really excited to receive it because I was on the hunt for a great razor that will leave my legs nice and smooth. I gave this razor four stars because of the fact that it made my leg bleed and even when I used a lot of shaving cream the razor didn&#x27;t glide as smooth as I thought it would. Other than that problem I loved the grip and the fact that it have 5 blades.. It&#x27;s pretty good to be a disposable razor..</li>
    <li> The razors are light and the lube strip definitely helps glide the razor across my legs and hands. I felt like my hand was just there for guidance, it did all the work. A far cry from the pressure I&#x27;ve always felt needed with the 2 bladed cheapies. It also went over my knees, under my arms, and over ankles with the same effortless motions. No hair. No nicks. No razor burn. And no rusty wet blades from sitting in water post shower.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, these are worth the extra. They even feel worth it when in the hand, all ergonomic and grippy. Happily I will be using these from now on! I think this is the best disposable woman&#x27;s razor on the market.</li>
    <li> I started shaving when I was about 12 years old, I&#x27;m almost 24 and after years of getting nicks, cuts and razor burn I was ready to give up until I received a pack of these babies FREE from a lovely site called Bzzagent where I was asked in return to give my honest review. I was so thrilled when I had an amazing experience with these razors which not only made my winter coat vanish but left my legs feeling softer! Given these are disposables I have been using my first one a couple months now and it STILL gets the job done :) Not to mention it has a nice handle, not too bulky and not too skinny it fits just perfectly in hand.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free as a brand promotion from BuzzAgent. I really loved this razor. Very nice handle that fit nicely in my hand, and great maneuverability. It really did leave my legs feel silky smooth for days afterwards. It really shaved close and got all the hairs. I also loved that for a disposable, it didnt look or feel or cut like one. The only reason i gave it a four star is because i got razor burn almost every time i used it, but i have very sensitive skin so i couldn&#x27;t tell if it was from the razor or just me.</li>
    <li> I used a Gillette Venus for YEARS, but finally decided to try the Hydro Silk . I can confidently say that I do not miss my Venus one bit! I&#x27;ve never used a razor that plays well with my eczema, but this one absolutely does. It hydrates surprisingly well and holds true to its name!&lt;br /&gt;Removes hair easily- I.e. One pass and it&#x27;s gone. No shaving the same area two or three times.&lt;br /&gt;Non-irritating- I.e. Doesn&#x27;t cause bumps or other skin irritation. A moisture additive that works would be a plus. Mobility- I.e. Flexibility of the razor head to move around curves. Totally loved it! Received it as a buzz agent for promotion of the brand</li>
    <li> Love these razors! Worth spending more money up front to get them in bulk. They do a great job shaving smooth surfaces thanks to the 5 blades and aloe strip. The aloe strip doesn&#x27;t get all sticky or come off at once and it seems to last for a decent amount of time. I&#x27;ve hardly had any nicks except when I was shaving too fast and careless but even then it wasn&#x27;t bad at all. (TMI I know)</li>
    <li> Schick sent me a free sample of these to try and I loved them! I am usually pretty particular about my razors due to my sensitive skin. I always exfoliate first and also use shaving cream for sensitive skin which helps as well. I felt like I got a close shave and did not experience any razor burn. I also did not break out using these as well. I shaved two days ago and my skin still feel really soft, so much better than when I use the cheap no name brand razors. Definitely would recommend purchasing these!</li>
    <li> #SchickHydroSilk is great! The razor makes shaving my legs super easy especially on the knees and on the curves from the back that I usually wind up cutting when using another razor product. Thank you #Bzzagent and #ShickHydroSilk for letting me join the campaign and for sending me 3 #SchickHydroSilk razors, skintimate skin therapy shaving gel, bath sponge and some coupons to get more of these! #GotitFree</li>
