      <li>a great brush speacially if u are tender headed like i am, very soft.</li>

      <li>It feels good on my scalp and when my hair has been dry for a while and its a bit messed up I can brush it with this brush and it looks good again.</li>
      <li>So instead of using it as a hairbrush, my wife now uses it to dust off items in the home as its consistancy lends itself more useful for that task better than for use on one&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>but it worked just fine for the price for me to take on vacation..</li>
      <li>My hair texture is still medium -- not baby fine --</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>

      <li>This is a fine brush at an inexpensive price.</li>
      <li>Strong but soft, Brushes beard good.</li>
      <li>but it has nice bristles and if very functional.  </li>
      <li>I find the brush to be comfortable on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>Try one of these for a laugh before getting a more functional brush.</li>
      <li>Bristles were too soft to effectively &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; your hair.</li>
      <li>AS DESCRIBED, QUICKLY SHIPPED.</li>
      <li>Been trying for years to find a new brush to replace one I&#x27;ve had for too many years now.</li>
      <li>Overall, pretty good brush.  </li>
      <li>Way too soft to effectively brush most hair, unless your hair is very very very short.</li>
      <li>This made me want it right away.  </li>
      <li>I liked the brush so much that I bought a second one so that I would have one at home and one at my work office.  </li>
      <li>The boar hair bristles are very gentle on his face and soften the beard.  </li>
      <li>The brush is fine; a bit softer than I anticipated for boar bristles, almost too soft, but it works well.</li>
      <li>Got this brush for my husband and he absolutely LOVES it!</li>
      <li>The quality was much higher than I&#x27;d expect for the $</li>
      <li>I keep this in my car because I love driving with the windows open -</li>
      <li>I could not find a boar&#x27;s hair brush that was narrow like this that was good quality (Wood Handle).</li>
      <li>very well made,this is realy a &#x27;hair&#x27; brush, most brushes sold know are made from HARD plastic and hurt and damage scalp ,brush is nice, thanks</li>
      <li>It will not take the place of my crown quality products but its a good back up brush especially in my crown area!</li>
      <li>once you kind of get a technique down.</li>
      <li>Boar bristles, no matter how they&#x27;re advertised, will always be super soft.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but lots of it and technically this brush works I suppose.</li>
      <li>My hair grows fast, so after two weeks of wolfing it becomes ineffective.</li>
      <li>I bought this brush because I wanted something that would be gentle on my hair, which is thinning.  </li>
      <li>I use it to smooth out my daughter&#x27;s hair when pulling it back for competitions.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
      <li>I really like this brush.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would be rating a hair brush, but I really was amazed with the quality and feel of this brush.</li>
      <li>Firm bristles, nice grip.</li>
      <li>Upon receipt I found the bristles to be very soft and packed together exactly like you will find in a paintbrush..</li>
      <li>I use this brush on my head hair witch is fine and long.  </li>
      <li>This is different than the &#x27;reinforced&#x27; boar bristle brushes that are mixed with plastic bristles, and probably better for your hair in my opinion as it will redistribute oils, etc.</li>
      <li>I love it, but the bristols were way to tight and close together for me..</li>
      <li>High quality, well made brush.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>Kinda rough looking, but works fine.</li>
      <li>I wish the bristles were a little more angled.</li>
      <li>I think that this brush is probably too soft for me to use as a detangler, because it doesn&#x27;t reach my scalp unless I really push it against my head.  </li>
      <li>I cannot live without this brush.</li>
      <li>This brush is stiff but not very, and has a soft feel to my scalp in which I haven’t been successful in finding for years.</li>
      <li>so very soft for it.</li>
      <li>The bristles are very soft.  </li>
      <li>I think the brush works a lot better on dry or mostly dry hair.</li>
      <li>brush is too soft</li>
      <li>I read a review for this brush and someone said it was too soft.  </li>
      <li>The natural Boars bristles are too soft to brush through your hair.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are so soft against your head that a lot of people would prefer this, I imagine.</li>
      <li>so tried finding another, but this one is way to soft.  </li>
      <li>, BRISTLES ARE NATURAL BRUSH</li>
      <li>There is another natural boars bristle brush made that I bought as well</li>
      <li>Strongly recommend giving it a chance given the small investment you have to make.</li>
      <li>Although it seems fairly well constructed (yet the bristles are less sturdy than a Conair I bought at CVS, the problem, as a prior review noted and I failed to heed, is that the bristles are pretty soft.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it&#x27;s too soft.</li>

    <li> Good hair brush. Firm bristles, nice grip. Kinda rough looking, but works fine.</li>
    <li> its fake don&#x27;t bye man! Diane got cursive font on it . Don&#x27;t waste yo money on this cheep fake shi</li>
    <li> The brush that you see in the picture is not what you get in the mail. But a brush is a brush and it works.</li>
    <li> Used this brush for about two weeks and the hairs started to fall out</li>
    <li> Well made brush; bristles a little softer than I expected but meets my needs.</li>
    <li> too soft for my rough hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would be rating a hair brush, but I really was amazed with the quality and feel of this brush. I got it in 3 days...can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> I use this brush on my head hair witch is fine and long.  I am able to brush without ripping or breaking hairs.  I find the brush to be comfortable on my scalp.  I liked the brush so much that I bought a second one so that I would have one at home and one at my work office.  I sometimes use this on my long beard as well, but I also have a larger Diane brush that I prefer for my beard.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to develop a wave pattern on the crown of my head. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it&#x27;s too soft. My hair grows fast, so after two weeks of wolfing it becomes ineffective. Still a great brush to develop the doppler or swirl pattern on the crown area for wavers.</li>
    <li> Item received as described. Purchased as a gift.</li>
    <li> ITEM AS DESCRIBED, BRISTLES ARE NATURAL BRUSH IS NICE TO USE, BOUGHT FOR A 71 YO MAN WHOS IN THE HOSPITAL.</li>
    <li> very well made,this is realy a &#x27;hair&#x27; brush, most brushes sold know are made from HARD plastic and hurt and damage scalp ,brush is nice, thanks</li>
    <li> a great brush speacially if u are tender headed like i am, very soft. couldnt be happier. and affordable! awesome!</li>
    <li> Although it seems fairly well constructed (yet the bristles are less sturdy than a Conair I bought at CVS, the problem, as a prior review noted and I failed to heed, is that the bristles are pretty soft.  It used to be possible, at a drug store, to buy an inexpensive, mildly curved brush with firm bristles.  Now I&#x27;ve been using 2 brushes, one with hard plastic bristles and another that, like this one, has soft bristles for the final smoothing.  I had hoped to find one brush that would do both, but this is not it.</li>
    <li> This is a fine brush at an inexpensive price. Works good for a man with thinning hair-I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but lots of it and technically this brush works I suppose. I imagined the brush to be stiffer from the picture - entirely my fault. The brush is super soft and I have a hard time getting it to touch my scalp. I can manage to get it to with a back and forth motion, but this is never going to massage my scalp like I want it to. That being said, I like how it spreads removes oils from my head.</li>
    <li> Reliable hair brush. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair when using it.</li>
    <li> Husband has quite a head of hair as well as a longish wiry beard.  The boar hair bristles are very gentle on his face and soften the beard.  Great product for men in my husband&#x27;s um...condition!</li>
    <li> Works fine. Good on the beard. Not so much on the thick hair. Needs a shorter length for that. Finish of handle is nice.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this brush. I buy them 5 at a time because my kids keep losing them but it&#x27;s the only brush I can use on my girls hair without them yelling that it hurts.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I wanted something that would be gentle on my hair, which is thinning.  My hair texture is still medium -- not baby fine -- but I&#x27;m just losing overall strands.  I think that this brush is probably too soft for me to use as a detangler, because it doesn&#x27;t reach my scalp unless I really push it against my head.  But that is probably my fault, for getting a brush that is too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like this brush for just smoothing my hair, once it&#x27;s already detangled.  For someone with naturally finer hair, this brush would probably be great.  I think about little kids, for example.  The bristles are so soft against your head that a lot of people would prefer this, I imagine.</li>
    <li> It does the job well enough, especially for an old man who has little hair left.</li>
    <li> Great buy I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> A good quality brush. Compact size, too.</li>
    <li> I needed a hair brush.  This works.  The bristles are very soft.  I would have preferred stiffer bristles.  The wood handle is nice.</li>
    <li> It will not take the place of my crown quality products but its a good back up brush especially in my crown area!</li>
    <li> Great boar bristle brush. Thick, fairly soft bristles that work well for my fairly thin hair and my sons thick hair. For $5 you can&#x27;t go wrong, especially considering the price for similar brushes at the local store.</li>
    <li> Smooth and hard at the same time without the scratchiness.  Overall, pretty good brush.  Also like the color and for some reason shipped a lot faster than the rest of the things I ordered with it.</li>
    <li> This is very soft however if you are trying to distribute your hair&#x27;s natural oils (such as in the no-poo method) and you have thin hair it works well once you kind of get a technique down.</li>
    <li> Keep yourself looking sharp with these boar bristle brushes. I keep this in my car because I love driving with the windows open - after I park I grab the brush and put my hair back in place. High quality, well made brush.</li>
    <li> brush is too soft I probably should return it. This brush would make a nice brush to stroke you clothes</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are very soft, unlike others we&#x27;ve had in the past.  I use it to smooth out my daughter&#x27;s hair when pulling it back for competitions.  We lost our other boar bristle brush so tried finding another, but this one is way to soft.  If you&#x27;re looking for soft bristles, this would be a good one!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush for a nice price.  Very nice handle</li>
    <li> Bristles were too soft to effectively &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; your hair.</li>
    <li> The brush is fine; a bit softer than I anticipated for boar bristles, almost too soft, but it works well.</li>
    <li> Been trying for years to find a new brush to replace one I&#x27;ve had for too many years now. This brush is stiff but not very, and has a soft feel to my scalp in which I haven’t been successful in finding for years. Strongly recommend giving it a chance given the small investment you have to make.</li>
    <li> Strong but soft, Brushes beard good. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> Way too soft to effectively brush most hair, unless your hair is very very very short.</li>
    <li> Puts hairs in their place!</li>
    <li> Boar bristles, no matter how they&#x27;re advertised, will always be super soft. This brush will not compare to a nylon bristle brush for penetration.</li>
    <li> Here is an item modeled like the popular nylon bristle brush we used to be able to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of these for the shape and ease of using this type of brush. Upon receipt I found the bristles to be very soft and packed together exactly like you will find in a paintbrush.. The description indicates it is a styling brush But for anyone except babies small children and folks with balding thinning hair, it&#x27;s the same consistancy as using a paintbrush  on your hair..Did I mention lack of control here ? So instead of using it as a hairbrush, my wife now uses it to dust off items in the home as its consistancy lends itself more useful for that task better than for use on one&#x27;s hair. Try one of these for a laugh before getting a more functional brush.</li>
    <li> The natural Boars bristles are too soft to brush through your hair.  Especially when your hair is dry.  They just bend  and slide over the surface.  There is another natural boars bristle brush made that I bought as well ( Diane club brush with extra reinforced bristles) that works much better.  The diff. being - reinforced boars means it is mixed with nylon bristles.  I am looking for a brush that actually goes through the stands of hair to the scalp when you begin to brush.</li>
    <li> I read a review for this brush and someone said it was too soft.  This made me want it right away.  The brush is very soft but still firm enough to get the job done.  Best men&#x27;s brush I have ever used and for under $5, you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Very well made and works exactly as I expected it to</li>
    <li> Though bristles would be firmer, but my hair is fine so brush worked out well. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> I can always count on &amp;#34;amazon.com&amp;#34; for best selection and best price...Happy customer for many more good deal hunting. Bravo.</li>
    <li> Great for the cats.  Very stiff bristles.</li>
    <li> excellent quality and price</li>
    <li> We bought this because our son had grown a mane and wanted a brush.  The quality was much higher than I&#x27;d expect for the $ and he&#x27;s really enjoyed it.  This is different than the &#x27;reinforced&#x27; boar bristle brushes that are mixed with plastic bristles, and probably better for your hair in my opinion as it will redistribute oils, etc.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my cat, I had a horsehair brush a few years ago but it broke, I replaced it with one I bought from a pet store but it was one of those plastic ones and my cat hated it, never wanted me to come near her with it when she used to run to me every time I brought out the previous brush. This one brought back that enthusiasm and she&#x27;s oh so very soft for it.</li>
    <li> Got this brush for my husband and he absolutely LOVES it! Soft on the head, but great job on the hair!</li>
    <li> I wish the bristles were a little more angled. Otherwise nice quality.</li>
    <li> Im the type of guy that throws on a t-shirt, some jeans, white sox and some tennis shoes and I&#x27;m ready to go. I spend just long enough on my hair to wet it, brush it so it looks like everything is going in the same direction then its deodorant and away I go. I really like this brush. It feels good on my scalp and when my hair has been dry for a while and its a bit messed up I can brush it with this brush and it looks good again. I think the brush works a lot better on dry or mostly dry hair. I am just really impressed with this brush. I had no idea what boar bristles were but I&#x27;m happy with it, whatever they are. I recommend this brush, very nice and a decent price I think for what your getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not agree with Amazon&#x27;s pro-homosexuality stance. Amazon should not use their corporate presence to promote such an agenda. This was poor taste on Amazon&#x27;s part, where were your heads?</li>
    <li> Okay 4 stars may be pushing it but it has nice bristles and if very functional.  If it had a wooden handle or even a rubber coated plastic I think I would give it five stars.  It&#x27;s the handle I&#x27;m not fond of.  It is kind of lightweight slippery plastic.  But for the price it is a good deal.  If all you want is function then this is the brush for you.  If you want something that feels good in your hand, then you need to keep looking.  I could not find a boar&#x27;s hair brush that was narrow like this that was good quality (Wood Handle).</li>
    <li> AS DESCRIBED, QUICKLY SHIPPED.</li>
    <li> I am giving 4 starts for quality.. I love it, but the bristols were way to tight and close together for me.. but it worked just fine for the price for me to take on vacation.. and then just leave in the hotel for my return</li>
    <li> Cant beat this brush for the cost. Holding up well, very comfortable.</li>
