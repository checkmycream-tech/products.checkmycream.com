      <li>it&#x27;s full stickiness.</li>
      <li>the stickiness wears off fairly quickly, and 2.)</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about 6 months, but it worked from the very first night.  </li>

      <li>It was more expensive but also had better reviews.  </li>

      <li>As a 42 year old side-sleeper, I had become very self-conscious of the wrinkles on my chest.  </li>

      <li>I am now in my early 40&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I have had chest wrinkles since my early to mid-twenties</li>
      <li>I reordered again and the new ones don&#x27;t last at all.  </li>
      <li>and I swear I can barely see any wrinkles now.</li>
      <li>It is washable but it is kind of weird to wash, it doesn&#x27;t retain</li>
      <li>If you clean your pad everyday and always use a toner or alcohol on your chest prior to use, it will last for several weeks.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer the Bellini pad and went back to it after about a week and a half.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just ok.  These do suit the purpose but I like sleeping in mine and they don&#x27;t stay.  Using in the morning for a couple hours does work though so I do recommend, I just like another brand better</li>
    <li> Very good product, clean with alcohol to extend use</li>
    <li> I wear this every night, overnight, it leaves my chest smooth and wrinkle free. I would not want to go without this item. I can get about 4-5 weeks per pad before I need to replace it. It is washable but it is kind of weird to wash, it doesn&#x27;t retain it&#x27;s full stickiness. However, it is one expense that I have no problem paying!</li>
    <li> Product does not adhere well, rolls and cones off while you skeep</li>
    <li> This product works very well for me - I don&#x27;t think that I could go back to living without it, to be honest.  As a 42 year old side-sleeper, I had become very self-conscious of the wrinkles on my chest.  I have been using this product for about 6 months, but it worked from the very first night.  No wrinkles at all the next morning.  I was shocked at how well it worked.  It was summer when I started using it, and I became confident once again in my summer dresses and bathing suit.  It only stays sticky for a couple of weeks, but I sleep with a \\&quot;cuddle pillow\\&quot; nestled against it, which holds it in place.  As a result I can get about 6 weeks out of each set.  Also, I knew from other reviews that it loses its adhesive more quickly than the supplier indicates, so I was not disappointed when the adhesive faded.  I wash it every few days with baby shampoo and let it air dry before placing back on the liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a couple of months, I tried the Silc Skin Decollette pad.  It was more expensive but also had better reviews.  I much prefer the Bellini pad and went back to it after about a week and a half.  The Silc Skin lost its stickiness sooner, and even with a pillow against it, it didn&#x27;t stay in place as well as this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with the results provided by this product.</li>
    <li> My Sis told me about this product. If used religiously... Works exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I bought the Bellini pad a few months ago and it worked for a long time.  I reordered again and the new ones don&#x27;t last at all.  They simply stop working after two weeks (they don&#x27;t stick).  What a rip off.  I&#x27;m going to try another brand because I love the concept.  It really works.  I use them when I sleep and I wake up with no wrinkles, but I need something that lasts longer, because they are not cheap.</li>
    <li> If you clean your pad everyday and always use a toner or alcohol on your chest prior to use, it will last for several weeks.  I use it all night long.  However, learning to sleep on your back will solve the problem too.</li>
    <li> I have had chest wrinkles since my early to mid-twenties I am now in my early 40&#x27;s. When I saw the Bellini reusable chest pads I had to give them a try. I have used them about 6 or 7 times now and I swear I can barely see any wrinkles now. I don&#x27;t understand how they work so well. I am just happy that they do! I am actually going to purchase the pads for the face in hopes that they work as well. There are two drawbacks to this product 1.) the stickiness wears off fairly quickly, and 2.) if I leave the pad on for more than a couple of hours my skin feels itchy and irritated.</li>
    <li> These do stick will I&#x27;ve used others that were better. Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> A MUST HAVE Works great and half the price of another popular brand. If you rinse, air dry and store on the waffled sheet it comes with it will last much longer.</li>
    <li> Have used SilcSkin for two years and tried this product due to price. While it is okay, it doesn&#x27;t work as well--stay on as well- as SilcSkin. I will not order again.</li>
    <li> i can not tolerate it, very itchy</li>
    <li> Love these....and having the pair makes me able to use one on my neck.</li>
    <li> I like these…I think they work to a degree…the only think that isn&#x27;t great is they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> These pads do help the wrinkles but they don&#x27;t last very long. They lose the ability to adhere to the skin very quickly, after 7 or 8 uses. Even washing them doesn&#x27;t help. I like the product but the adhesive quality needs to be improved.</li>
    <li> It is awesome!!!! No more wrinkles in my chest!!!</li>
    <li> Works really well, very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pads for about a year and am very happy with the results. No more chest wrinkles, yeah! They each last about 1-3 months, if you take care of them they &#x27;ll do better. I hD to rinse them each morning, removed dog hair, dirty skin, etc . But it is worth it in my opinion. They even sent me a freebie for being a regular customer. :)</li>
    <li> I like these a lot. I bought the other brand before that has just one in a pack for about the same price. Yes those are stickier but these work just ass well unless you sweat really bad. What I liked about these is they don&#x27;t get all gross like the more sticky ones. Also you get 2 for what the price of one of the others will cost you. I recommend this product for anyone embarrassed by chest wrinkles like I was.</li>
    <li> By using this each night, the wrinkles that were forming on my chest have completely gone away! One of my friends even commented on how they&#x27;ve disappeared.  It is very comfortable and easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get one use out of these.  Each pad fell off on the first use.  I don&#x27;t use lotion on my chest and I don&#x27;t have oily skin.  I will always pay for the more expensive brands of décolleté pads.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a miracle. I never thought I would get rid of those little dehydrated lines on my chest because I am a side sleeper. They&#x27;re gone. One night. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all completely moves with you as you toss and turn. I&#x27;m AMAZED by this simple solution. This will do what creams and a plastic surgeon can&#x27;t do to your décolleté area. I&#x27;m in complete shock that these are sold everywhere .</li>
    <li> Great product. Would buy again.</li>
