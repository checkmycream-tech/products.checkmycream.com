      <li>this works good in puffing up your lips for sure</li>
      <li>BUT LIKE A NICE LIP GLOSS.  </li>
      <li>but as people have said it feels good but does nothing but moisturize which is ok.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s got a good taste :)</li>
      <li>Nice feeling on lips, but</li>
      <li>It is fairly inexpensive, and anything&#x27;s better, and looks better, than surgical intervention.  </li>
      <li>The best product for the most reasonable price, anywhere.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s nice</li>
      <li>It feels really good and also gives a full feeling.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for more</li>
      <li>The lipgloss conditions lips &amp; gives a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>I knew it had been working as well as promised but recently kissing someone, they commmented on how wonderful my lips felt..</li>
      <li>I know, I have had them done many times over the years.</li>
      <li>I love it as an every day lip gloss.</li>
      <li>As many women realise, when you get into your 40s, things you took for granted evaporate (like youth).</li>
      <li>I will keep on using for better result.</li>
      <li>that being said, my lips were okay, but drier and always needing balm.</li>
      <li>This feels lovely</li>
      <li>I have purchased so many lip products to help combat chapped lips</li>
      <li>LOVE  </li>
      <li>Love the flavor and doesn&#x27;t feel gunky on the lip.</li>
      <li>NOT ANY MORE AFTER USING THIS</li>
      <li>Use with your favorite shade of lipstick or alone.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love Lip Fusion products.  </li>
      <li>It is even better then expencive chapsticks.</li>
      <li>My favorite lip gloss.</li>
      <li>and I will give it more time.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting more since the formula contains collagen.  </li>
      <li>I love lip fusion</li>
      <li>I will buy more when it runs out.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>I think I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love the 2 sided wand</li>
      <li>The two sided deal is goofy and  feels backwards to use.</li>
      <li>IF YOU WANT SULTRY AND SEXY LIPS... ???  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve forgotten to use it over night more than once</li>
      <li>This is more of a lip gloss than anything else.</li>
      <li>I got none of the tingling most people say they experience when they put either the night gloss or the day gloss.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Lipfusion. :)</li>
      <li>This product being available on Amazon gave me confidence in purchasing - guess it is the luck of the draw!</li>
      <li>Its okay</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>, instead it just makes them look their personal best.  </li>
      <li>The moisture goes on and on throughout the day, and even makes my lipstick look better.  </li>
      <li>I use the silver end the most because I apply it every night before bed-</li>
      <li>It was more like \\&quot;these are MY lips, at their best.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>The XL has a nice mild minty flavor, and the daytime one has sort of an herbally flavor.</li>
      <li>At best you get very slight, temporary, feel good, plumping action that makes your lips feel really good, but</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re like me and you want beauty without a ton of makeup or a huge routine, this stuffis a worthwhile investment.</li>
      <li>Keeps lips soft and smooth and lipstick glides on beautifully.  </li>
      <li>my lips have rediscovered a plumper, softer, and more sensual shape making me feel I could go out with just a light coat of Lipfusion and no lipstick added.  </li>
      <li>The cost to return doesn&#x27;t justify it because i want this product and would just have to go out and spend more money on a full sized one at a reputable store.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i just bought this plumper and I notice already that it works.  Each end has a wand, with the stronger one being used for bedtime.  It is fairly inexpensive, and anything&#x27;s better, and looks better, than surgical intervention.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have had my lips done by injection so I was hoping this would give it a little extra boost.  it really didn&#x27;t plumb them but I like the product enough to purchase again.</li>
    <li> nothing like they advertise it. Feels tingling on the lips when you apply. Not worth the money, go buy a regular gloss instead</li>
    <li> One end is plumper and it does work well. The other end is really only a gloss.  Kind of disappointing but not a bad product.</li>
    <li> I like this product, first of all it has 2 sides that you are having 2 products in one. One side is for day, the other side is for night. I didn&#x60;t get any surprisingly plump, but I got my regular lip volume back same as when I was in my 20&#x60;s. I am using this product day time with Buxom WHITE RUSSIAN Big &amp; Healthy Lip Cream Lip Gloss (Travel size). I can say that my lip never get dry with this Lip Plumper lipgloss.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not plump lips.  It doesn&#x27;t even moisterize.  Never again will I try it.  Don&#x27;t waste your $$$  It&#x27;s a rip off.</li>
    <li> Its okay, I prefered a brand i used in the past that is no longer avaible. Not sure I would recommend. The two sided deal is goofy and  feels backwards to use.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lip plumper, does make your lips look and feel smoother, possibly fuller if you use it at night, but anything topical is going to just be temporary---no miracles here.</li>
    <li> so far this hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.  I thought I would feel a tingle that most plumpers usually have..this has nothing.  the gloss isn&#x27;t sticky or gummy, but it is thick and lasts...  I am not a big fan of glass that looks like you just ate a bucket of KGC...so I only wear this around the house hoping it works over time...so far nothing</li>
    <li> My favorite lip gloss. Makes my lips perfectly plump and beautiful. I always feel so beautiful wearing it. Its not like those fake ones that dont really do anything. Its perfect</li>
    <li> The best lip gloss ive ever tried. It is even better then expencive chapsticks. It keeps my lips very plump for a very long time and even when I forget to put it on my lips dont go back to being dry. And I could see the difference within a week. Best purchase ever.</li>
    <li> Adds a little plump, not as much as I expected but it is helping with a moisture. I will keep on using for better result. Love the flavor and doesn&#x27;t feel gunky on the lip. When I use lipstick I put it over it and it fills the lines so lips are smooth. When used alone it brings the lip color out more and lips are not so pale. Overall I love the product. It is not stinging like other lip plumpers.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and gives you a little burning sensation that goes away after 10/15 min.&lt;br /&gt;However not really worth $14 or meet the advertised plumping expectations ;)</li>
    <li> I did not know what to expect with this. I think I love it.  Time will tell as far as long term benefits. The size is much larger than I expected.  If this is the travel size, I wonder how large the regular size is?  The container is very nice and appealing. This company has be highly rated.  It makes my lips feel so good with that sort of peppermint feeling and makes them so soft. Yum!  It plumps the lips a little bit, kind of smooths out the lip lines.  It is glossy but not too glossy, as some are.  One end is for use at night and the other , the XL, for daytime use. I am going to purchase the pencil as well.  These cosmetics are very high quality. I am hoping for long term benefits but we&#x27;ll see.  I live in New Mexico where the climate is so very dry.  I have purchased so many lip products to help combat chapped lips and I never buy them again.  I would buy this again, I think it is a keeper.  If I change my mind will do a follow-up review and let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently purchased quite a few top ranked lip plumpers to try . None of them are close to looking like the injections you get at the Dr&#x27;s office.  I know, I have had them done many times over the years. I do not do  lip injections anymore as I have large enough lips already.  I do them  now  to immediately get rid of nose to mouth lines,  lines around the mouth, forehead lines, etc.  It takes at least 10 years off your face instantly and lasts up to two years.  It bugs me that companies, such as this one,  say they are the same...they are NOT.  At best you get very slight, temporary, feel good, plumping action that makes your lips feel really good, but nowhere near what the injections do.  That said, there is a place for these type products as well.</li>
    <li> Really good product!  I used it daily (1-2x per day) and have noticed now after the 2nd week a subtle plump to my lips.  The lipgloss conditions lips &amp; gives a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> i had no idea this would show up the next day!  i was asked to look for this from a japanese chick i know.  bam!  here it is!</li>
    <li> This product is a moisturizer only. It has 2 formulas at the ends with applicators in the center section. Easy to apply and great for thirsty lips but won&#x27;t change their plumpness. Seller made no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 weeks now.  I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference, but I also have a bad habit of forgetting to use it like I should.  I think I might possibly see a tiny bit of color coming back in my bottom lip.  I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s not just wishful thinking on my part.  But my bottom lip had lost so much color, besides losing volume, that it just about disappeared in photos.  So I do think I&#x27;m seeing a tiny bit of results.  I don&#x27;t see any change in the volume of my lips though.  It does taste good, lol.  The XL has a nice mild minty flavor, and the daytime one has sort of an herbally flavor. It&#x27;s  bit shiny for my taste, and feels a bit sticky, but that doesn&#x27;t last long, and my lips actually are getting softer.  It seems that different people have gotten different results, and that&#x27;s normal because everybody&#x27;s different.  I will continue to use this and come back later if I see any more results.</li>
    <li> This feels lovely and I noticed it plumping my lips immediately. This is just what I was looking for. Great</li>
    <li> BEEN USING THIS FOR 3 YEARS. LOVE  IT.  MY LIP  USED  TO BE SO  DRY  AND CRACKED IN THE WINTER, NO MATTER  WHAT  I PUT ON.  NOT ANY MORE AFTER USING THIS. I  HAVE A PAIR OF FULL  AND SEXY LIP. AND I  DON&#x27;T  EVEN NEED TO PUT  ANYTHING BESIDE THIS... ABSOLUTELY ONE OF MY  FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH .....</li>
    <li> I gave it a good try but as people have said it feels good but does nothing but moisturize which is ok.</li>
    <li> Does what any lip gloss does. Nothing else. Lips did not change size, or texture. Felt nice on lips but would not repurchase only because of amount.</li>
    <li> Have used it day &amp; night per the directions on box.  No plumping but does keep lips moisturized.  Have tried inexpensive drugstore products that were comparable. Will not purchase this product again but great service from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is too glossy for me.  Also, it is impossible to wear lipstick with it.  It does work good as a night treatment for the lips.</li>
    <li> It has a tinkle to it but it absorbs very well into your lips and you can see a slight difference</li>
    <li> I purchased mine from Amazon seller: Best Prices Online FL.  Trying to be as honest as possible, but I can see it&#x27;s brand new (without a box), but the XL half isn&#x27;t working as well as when Sephora used to sell the full sized version of it.  The Lip Fusion Gloss half tingled a little but, again, wasn&#x27;t as good as when Sephora was sellingthe full sized version of it.  I wonder if Best Prices Online FL is selling expired products at a discount?  It only hurts the brand image selling expired/useless products to consumers who are familiar with how this product normally works.  Maybe that&#x27;s why they show the box in the photos but label it as unboxed.  Does the box have expiration dates?  I don&#x27;t remember off hand.  Disappointing.  I&#x27;d purchase this elsewhere if you want fresh, full strength.</li>
    <li> I use this instead of lip gloss when I want a shine to my lips. I also use it at night. I have noticed that the tiny vertical line that was forming on my upper lip is gone now. My lips stay soft and do seem fuller with the Lipfusion products I use (I also use the balm with SPF.) This does not give the &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; effect of lip injections, but more of a long-term hydration of the lips, which enables them to be their naturally full self, with perhaps an extra little &amp;#34;oomph.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t think any product can give the exact plumping effect of getting injections. However, there is no downside to this product, as you aren&#x27;t getting injected with a filler that might migrate, will hurt like a bee sting when you&#x27;re injected, to which you might have an adverse allergic reaction, and that might make you end up with &amp;#34;fish pout&amp;#34; which doesn&#x27;t look good on anyone. I took a photo of myself without make up, as I rarely use any, for my Facebook page, and a friend&#x27;s comment read, &amp;#34;You should be a lipstick model.&amp;#34; Thank you! I&#x27;ll stick with Lipfusion. :)</li>
    <li> My lips were always a little on the dry side, no matter how much water I would drink.  I was always on the hunt for a balm that would give me lush, line-free lips.  I tried balms from make-up stores, department stores, drug stores.  I tried all natural products, and medicated products.  Tried and true products. I exfoliated, I sugar scrubbed, I vaseline&#x27;d.  Nothing ever really felt like it truly sank into the skin of my lips, and some even made the dryness worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first night I slept with this product on my lips, I woke up to soft, line-free, plush lips.  Not inflated mind you, nothing that dramatic.  It was more like \\&quot;these are MY lips, at their best.\\&quot;  They were soft, and so moisturized that I could see how this would be considered a lip plumper.  The moisture goes on and on throughout the day, and even makes my lipstick look better.  The fullness has also been noted by my fiance, who had asked if this was why some mornings my kisses felt so soft and full. Typically he&#x27;s not one to notice any changes in my beauty regime, so that was pretty telling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I love it, if only because it&#x27;s so good to my skin.</li>
    <li> It is the best working plumper I have tried this far and so easy to apply store back in purse.</li>
    <li> Works great, but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> Bigger than i thought :) already purchased the big sizes of each or them in the past. I now use them both in one pack. Definitely value for money!!</li>
    <li> I still haven&#x27;t seen any plumping in my lips after several weeks. So, it wasn&#x27;t expensive but I expected a little bit more.</li>
    <li> WELL TO BE HONEST, IT MADE MY LIPS VERY SOFT BUT DID NOT NOTICE ANY PLUMPING AT ALL.  THE  ONE END FOR DAY HAD TINGLING BUT LIKE A NICE LIP GLOSS.  THE OTHER END FOR NIGHT TIME FELT WONDERFUL ON MY LIPS.  WILL USE TIL EMPTY AND ENJOY THE SOFTENING FOR MY LIPS.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this purchase. It is an overpriced lip gloss which is also very sticky. Gave it a chance for the first week then gave up on it.</li>
    <li> This did not do a thing for me. I wasted my money on it. I would not recommend to anyone who can&#x27;t afford to toss money away. You will most likely not get results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s nice but I never received it so I don&#x27;t know. This is the only area for me to write any comments at this point so I would appreciate hearing back from someone.</li>
    <li> Did not like this product at all. It was too oily and heavy for daily use. Just did not like at all.</li>
    <li> I think this sat on a shelf for a couple of years.  Hardly anything in the daytime tube.  I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> I think that this is a good lip plumper.  I especially like the look of my lips in the morning.  My only wish is for big lips. Fusion only gives a little plump.  But there is no sting at all.  That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this would have miraculous effects to zero out the bad ingredients but so far, no luck.  I do use it right before a big night out or the like but I&#x27;ve forgotten to use it over night more than once so I can&#x27;t say that it works so much or not.  I&#x27;m glad I got this version for the lower price intead of springing for the more expensive one.  I do still use it although I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll buy it again unless I notice a huge difference at some point.  I can say that it makes my lips very soft and they feel hydrated when it&#x27;s on so I don&#x27;t feel like my lipliner and lipstick disappear as quickly.  I&#x27;ve been shying away from anything with mineral oil because I learned that it&#x27;s a false softner, making your lips require it once you start using it.  This is a definite drawback.</li>
    <li> I have bought Lipfusion a few times in department stores, I love it, it has always worked for me even though it was pricey.  When I saw this one sold here by &amp;#34;Fusion Beauty&amp;#34; was only $14.54, I was very excited.  When I received it, it was either expired or refilled with the wrong product.  I was so disappointed.</li>
    <li> will plump your lips, not bigtime but where you will notice.... i use at night and it does plump up , but if im to recommend i would definitly use&lt;br /&gt; two faced extreme lip injection, that one doesnt fool around the only one that reallllly does something noticeable...</li>
    <li> Thought it may work do to what I fet when applied, but no good. Do like moisture on lips though</li>
    <li> I like the product as a lip gloss, but didn&#x27;t feel it made my lips any plumper, which is why I bought the item. I have used it for several days and will keep using it to see if I get any better results.</li>
    <li> Lipfusion has kept my lips soft with no chapping for 10 years now.  I always use it before bed and again when I get out of the shower each morning right before my makeup and lipstick.  It is the best lip treatment I have ever used and stays on and lasts.</li>
    <li> Product came quicker then expected and the product is very glossy! It does pump my lips and feels great on them. I will purchase this product again from this seller!</li>
    <li> So received it two days ago, and it does work.  I can see the difference.  I will buy more when it runs out. probably before it runs out.</li>
    <li> Was great gave me the added pulmp I was looking for</li>
    <li> Wish I could say it worked for me, but no it pretty much just a gloss and it doesn&#x27;t stay glossy long either.</li>
    <li> This is literally a regular gloss that is over priced. It does no plumping at all, not at all. This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I read a number of different reviews on this product and decided to give it a try based on the positive characteristics noted in several of the reviewer&#x27;s commentaries as well as my familiarity with one of the main ingredients, hyluronic acid. I have to say I am extremely pleased with this product!  I was prepared for it to be perhaps just so-so, a good lip moisturizer without any other dramatic results, but for me it has turned out to be much more than that. I have been using the product consistently for one month and I will definitely repurchase! I use both ends of the product diligently although there may have been a night or two where I slipped into bed without the nightly application. It&#x27;s not something I normally forget however because it makes my lips feel (and look) so good. Over time I have noticed a very interesting and positive difference. This is definitely not a big huge lip plumper that you can only expect to receive from lip augmentation in your doctor&#x27;s office, but in many ways it is better because it is so natural. My lips have become more defined, softer, and maintain a soft rosy glow when I&#x27;m not wearing lipstick. I am a fair blonde and I feel naked without some shade of lipstick when I leave the house, but since following my regimen with this Lipfusion product my lips have rediscovered a plumper, softer, and more sensual shape making me feel I could go out with just a light coat of Lipfusion and no lipstick added.  It&#x27;s definitely kissable without being too sticky! It makes me really want to smile!</li>
    <li> this works good in puffing up your lips for sure but the by product is that it puffs up the skin everywhere it slides to.</li>
    <li> I liked the smell and the very slight plumping it gave me, but for the money I did expect more from the product.</li>
    <li> Less costly than city lips but nowhere near as good.</li>
    <li> This seems to be working just as stated.  I have been using it for2+ weeks each night at bedtime.  Lips seem fuller so far.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product it doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING at all, do not waste your money on this, only thing it was the fast shipping besides that not good.</li>
    <li> Ok..so initially i thought this was a three star product. I saw a tiny tiny bit of plumpness in my lips after using it consistently. But then I stopped using the product and tried using a regular lip moisturizer (my Jack Black lip balm) and got the same results. As it turns out, I realized that any lil moisturizer will make your dry lips full of moisture (if used often) and give you that tiny tiny amount of \\&quot;plump\\&quot; to your lips. This product is was over priced considering it doesn&#x27;t work. My jack black lip balm actually works better to moisturizer and \\&quot;plump\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Was not sure at first, but now I can&#x27;t leave home without it.  I great product with the perfect amount of shine for a natural look.</li>
    <li> XL is great but the lipgloss part is not for me. This product is great size for trial purpose.  If you are not sure what to buy between XL and lip fusion gloss, try this and find out your preference.</li>
    <li> No change in lips whatsoever. I&#x27;m not sure there is a product that actually works on truly small, thin lips.</li>
    <li> Everything and more, love the subtle visibility of the day gloss and the great results of the night formula I will definitely be purchasing more</li>
    <li> Worked great, was not what I was expecting. Didn&#x27;t like the dual-ended design, felt like I was carrying a baton, rather than a tube of lip gloss. Will buy again, separately. Lol.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do as much plumping as I expected, but it makes your lips incredibly soft. I love it as an every day lip gloss. No tingling or burning like normal lip plumpers. You put the XL one at night and the normal one during the day, and my lips have looked great but not that much lip plumping. I still like the product a lot and I would purchase it again. It is not that sticky and has a citrus taste and smell to it.</li>
    <li> Works great to keep lips moist. Doesn&#x27;t always plump them up though.</li>
    <li> Plumps perfectly, feels luscious on the lips, glossy, doesn&#x27;t sting like other plumpers.  Not waxy or dry.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more since the formula contains collagen.  It is definitely not a substitute for injections.  It can be applied as a gloss during the day, but not outside the lip line where you need it if it is to work on vertical lip lines.  It&#x27;s too gooey &amp; glisteney for that.  So i apply it at bedtime.  I was hoping for more but it does help some but after several weeks, no dramatic changes.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order of this and I could not live without it.. The best product for the most reasonable price, anywhere. I knew it had been working as well as promised but recently kissing someone, they commmented on how wonderful my lips felt.. Added bonus! Would recommend to anyone that wants a fuller, softer pout.</li>
    <li> This product came up in the sidebar while buying the lipfusion conditioning balms and after reading the reviews decided to give it a go. As many women realise, when you get into your 40s, things you took for granted evaporate (like youth). that being said, my lips were okay, but drier and always needing balm. I followed the instructions and saw results in a couple of days. You will NOT get movie star bee stung looking lips, unless you had those to begin with. What you will get are your lips, only better. Gone are dry lips, returned are my fulsome lips of my twenties! You won&#x27;t go wrong with this. It&#x27;s a new part of my dailty routine.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again...I really saw of felt any improvement as claimed</li>
    <li> Portable lip fusion perfection for travel or office.  You will have soft plump lips all year round.  Use with your favorite shade of lipstick or alone.  I hike and take Nature photographs for a living and I would never leave home without it!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping for something to hydrate my lips and make them a bit fuller.  I was not disappointed.  The next morning my lips were smooth and felt hydrated.  I only reapplied once during the day and my lips stayed smooth all day.  Very pleased, only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t plump, it makes them naturally full but not plump.  Not a big deal to me though.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Lip Fusion products.  All the plumping without the sting.  A must have beauty essential!! XL is the best plumper around!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I apply the night time application on and wake up to fuller lips!  Then in the morning I apply the day gloss to keep my lips plump!  Really pleased with it!</li>
    <li> Wow this product is fabulous. My lips feel and look amazing. I find my lipstick looks betters and lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Fusion Beauty for a great product!</li>
    <li> I use it morning and evening.  I think I see a results my lips look a bit more thick and I will give it more time.  It feels really good and also gives a full feeling.  I will use it longer and see if these results continue.</li>
    <li> The shipping was incredibly fast and I feel like it&#x27;s doing something. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this product and most likely repurchase. I would definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for something to help make your lips a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love lip fusion</li>
    <li> I am 73 years old and still look pretty young except for my lips. I&#x27;ve been on this nightly and sometimes&lt;br /&gt;AM and PM for four months. Wasn&#x27;t sure it was working for several weeks but now I can see that it&lt;br /&gt;has made my lips fuller. I bit pricey but I&#x27;ll stay on it because it really seems to work.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and taste of it. I really like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel like acid when I put it on my lips, like most lip plumping gloss. I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference in my lip fullness. If nothing else it&#x27;s got a good taste :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Apply before going to sleep and your lips are still moist and plumped when you wake in the morning.</li>
    <li> Lush, lovely and amazing. Love the 2 sided wand - I get double the product.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Keeps lips soft and smooth and lipstick glides on beautifully.  Also plumps them up.  Will keep ordering this product.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference to speak of, Vaseline, Waxelene, Glycerine work equally well.  Nice feeling on lips, but not&lt;br /&gt;worth purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I like how it gives you a bit of a tingle and seems to stay on a little longer than ordinary lip balm. Comes with clear gloss on other end and is nice on top of this for a more natural color (or lack of color).</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews but am a huge fan of LipFusion and was disappointed that Sephora stopped carrying it. That is until I saw that Amazon was carrying it and for way less. This is the only gloss I&#x27;ve used that does what it says and doesn&#x27;t leave my lips cracked or dry from the ingredients. I&#x27;m wearing it now over my fushia lipstick and it really gives it that extra umph. I will be a returning customer. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost. I seen a very slight difference and it is a little thick and sticky.</li>
    <li> WOW..... IF YOU WANT SULTRY AND SEXY LIPS... ???  YOU CAN BEGIN BY PURCHASING YOURSELF THE SET OF THREE (3) MUST HAVES... \\&quot;LIPFUSION\\&quot; !!!&lt;br /&gt;BEGIN BY THE DAILY USE OF LIPFUSION XL 2, OUTLINE, DEFINE AND TINT YOUR LIPS WITH THE USE OF THE FANTASTIC LIP PLUMPING PENCIL THEN USE THE SMOOTH SMOOCHING LIP GLOSS IN YOUR FAVORITE SHADE.

    <li> This is waste of money... it is just like an oil which fades away in two mins! no pumping whatsoever!</li>
    <li> this was a good purchase....love how it feels on my lips very tasty also. would definitely buy again...&lt;br /&gt;thanks much ..............</li>
    <li> What a waste of money this was.  Did not do anything it advertised.  Most of this stuff is just junk which matches the rest of my forced comment.  Babbling on unnecessarily to feel space does not make any sense to me and that&#x27;s why I using words to babble.  Only the first sentence was how I feel, the rest of this is nonsense.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worked very well for me. My lips are plumper.my lipline more defined and my lips are no longer dry.</li>
    <li> This is not a lip plumper, it only makes your lips tingle, similar to any chapstick out there.  It&#x27;s very glossy.</li>
    <li> I like having product for daytime as well as at night in one package.  I also like the sensation of the night-time product on the lips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using fusion for about 4 years only plumper that actually does what it says tastes good not tacky  best so far</li>
    <li> I almost can&#x27;t believe this is the same product I had read such great reviews on. I got none of the tingling most people say they experience when they put either the night gloss or the day gloss. I saw no discernible difference in my lips at all. This turned out to be a very expensive glorified lip gloss and not a good one at that. Very disappointed and really curious about whether I got a knock-off product...</li>
    <li> Lipfusion works. The disappointing thing is that the the tube lasts barely a week.. Having to go thru four of these a month would be an expensive bitch!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product, but am convinced it does not work as advertised.  Just another cosmetic that over promises and UNDER delivers.  Would not recommend.  Just Wish I had returned it and gotten my money back.  Oh well, we do live and learn.  This product being available on Amazon gave me confidence in purchasing - guess it is the luck of the draw!</li>
    <li> I get seriously dried out lips in the winter (I live in the Northeast) to the point that I was using vaseline at nighttime to prevent chapping.  This product is superior- not only does it keep my lips hydrating and as chap free as a spring day it also subtly plumps them.  Sure it&#x27;s probably just as full of goo as petroleum jelly but I&#x27;m not going to look at the ingredients so I can&#x27;t say.  I love the plumping action of this product- it&#x27;s not stingy or pepperminty- and it doesn&#x27;t make my (pale) lips red or irritated, instead it just makes them look their personal best.  I use the silver end the most because I apply it every night before bed- it&#x27;s a stronger formula than the clear end and less glossy.  Since I&#x27;m an adult and don&#x27;t wear glossy glosses ever I will only be repurchasing that part when I&#x27;m done with this doubled ended one.</li>
    <li> when i received the product, i was excited to see that it was a dual-sided day and night treatment.  unfortunately neither treatment works, as the product has become watery and does not seem to contain any more of the micro-plumping and tingling action anymore, either due to the product being defective or expired.  I am requesting a refund for my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The XL side is the premium of the two sides, but the other side is also good. Both sides are clear, but the XL side is fantastic. My lips stayed moisturized without a greasy feel. If you use this every day, every nite at bedtime, I am sure within a few weeks you&#x27;ll see a difference. The idea is not to get a \\&quot;bigger mouth\\&quot; but rather plumper lips. I love FUSION BEAUTY LIPFUSION DOUBLE ENDED-CLEAR,EXTRA LARGE. I would recommend this product. The moisturizing, plumping side is too expensive for me ($50) so getting the serum as one side is better than not getting it.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I use the XL more often than the other side. After 1 week of usage, my lines around my lips are diminishing. And, when worn w/ my lipstick, my lips looks plumper for sure!</li>
    <li> This product has a slight tingle to it. Have used it three times so far. Can not say whether or not it works yet. Not a bad taste at all. Lips are very soft &amp; smooth.</li>
    <li> There was a little plumbing, but I&#x27;ve used this for weeks and the plumping effect isn&#x27;t noticeable. Which is a shame because when I&#x27;ve used fusion beauty in past, I&#x27;ve generally had good experiences with their products. It still is a nice gloss. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again but I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> I tend to be a little tight with the amount of money that i spend on makeup. I did go all out for this one, I will say, it leaves similar results to a 3 dollar plumper that i own, but it does do the job a little bit better. This is&#x27;t for people that are looking for medical similar results. You get what you pay for. I am pleased with the product. Maybe a little out of my price range for the results.</li>
    <li> This really works.  First product I used that got rid of my chapped lips.  Can&#x27;t tell if it plumps.  Just started using it this past week.</li>
    <li> As a plumper I saw no noticeable difference not in the short term nor after wearing it daily for a month. As a treatment for keeping lips moist and supple I found myself having to constantly reapply- it didn&#x27;t moisturize any better than a typical lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Not a genuine product. It isn&#x27;t what it is advertised to do.</li>
    <li> Made no difference to the look or feel of my lips.</li>
    <li> It stays on lips for a while, smells good..but it did not do anything for my lips at all...waste of money</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product!! I have tried every lip plumper out there and nothing compares. Of course they are not actual lip injections from a doctor so the plumpness if that is a word will go away but it has so much moisturizer in it that it fills in every line and bye bye cracked lips (which I have also, tried all lip balms out there) Nothing compares to this. My husband did notice a difference and so have I!! It doesn&#x27;t burn like most and the smell isn&#x27;t bad it makes your lipstick stand out and and nothing bad I can say about this product definitely will order again!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have reordered about 4 times now, its the only product that seems to help and looks good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used a lip plumper, and for good reason - the plumpers of my past were irritating (often made with things like cinnamon or peppermint oil, which tingle and burn), smelled funny and the effects were minimal and didn&#x27;t last. I had the idea to try them again after trying a new lip color - you see, I&#x27;m pretty self conscious about my smile to the point where I&#x27;ve considered augmentation, always keeping my lips neutral so I&#x27;m not drawing attention to it, but plumping has helped improve it in the past. So there I was, looking through plumpers here on Amazon, finding many products but not a whole lot of good reviews. Enter Lipfusion. Even on other sites, it gets incredible reviews - but yikes, Lipfusion XL is expensive! So there&#x27;s this - the double ended version for far, far less. So I ordered it and took the advice I read on other reviews. I have to say, I&#x27;m about two weeks in now and already see an improvement. After a month I&#x27;ll come back and post a before/after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives to this versus the plumpers I&#x27;ve used in the past: it LASTS. You aren&#x27;t irritating your lips, they&#x27;re soaking up the micro collagen and moisturizers so this isn&#x27;t a matter of them swelling up for an hour because you&#x27;ve put cinnamon on them, they *stay* softer, fuller and fatter. My lips are larger but not dramatically so - which is a good thing, because let&#x27;s face it ladies, we&#x27;ve seen lip augmentation disasters and I do NOT want to be one of those! The effect so far is most visible from the side - the lips stick out more, and when I smile, you can actually see my top lip more. Hurrah! My lips are also softer and have more color to them, constantly rather than only for a short while after applying. This stuff is wonderful and I&#x27;ll be using it for a long, long time to come. I don&#x27;t even have to put anything on my lips anymore if I don&#x27;t feel like it, that&#x27;s the best part. If you&#x27;re like me and you want beauty without a ton of makeup or a huge routine, this stuffis a worthwhile investment. I don&#x27;t touch chapsticks or beeswax anymore. Literally all I need is XL at night before bed and regular Lipfusion before starting my day. As for the few negatives I&#x27;ve read about this product, I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a smell nor do I feel any tingling. I even have a lip piercing and it doesn&#x27;t irritate that at all. Granted as with all cosmetics, everyone&#x27;s experience is going to be a little different. Also keep in mind that this is going to make your lips fatter, but it wont dramatically change their shape (although, my upper lip has less of a dip in the center from growing plumper) nor will you see results overnight - if you want either of those, injections would be your only option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you&#x27;re trying a plumper for the first time or moving to this from another product - go for it. You won&#x27;t regret it. Take the advice posted here and exfoliate before using it, and be patient. Use the XL end before bed and the regular end before doing makeup. Take a before picture and compare in a couple of weeks - you WILL see a difference, but it happens slowly, so don&#x27;t expect to wake up the first morning with a Jolie-esque pout. Don&#x27;t expect injection-like results at all for that matter, this is for someone who isn&#x27;t ready to make that jump just yet. Heck, I&#x27;ve completely thrown the idea away because this has given me the subtle plump I&#x27;ve been wanting, especially with my upper lip. Enough that I&#x27;m smiling a heck of a lot more and not feeling so shy about it! ;-)  Thanks Lipfusion - I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
    <li> i ordered this before with no problems and loved it but now it arrived in a box with no seal for the box or the item (don&#x27;t remember if it was sealed before but these things usually have something).  The white lipgloss that is to be used during the day is almost empty.  There&#x27;s just enough gloss to coat the outside to make it look like there&#x27;s stuff in it.  i can&#x27;t tell with the other half because the case isn&#x27;t clear.  The cost to return doesn&#x27;t justify it because i want this product and would just have to go out and spend more money on a full sized one at a reputable store.  Even though that&#x27;s probably what i&#x27;ll have to do in a week or two.  Amazon products seem to be getting very very sketchy and many seem to be knock offs.  Quite disappointed.  Once our prime accounts expires i think we&#x27;ll be done with amazon.</li>
    <li> Does little of nothing!</li>
    <li> For an expensive price, I got...nothing. I used it faithfully in the way the directions indicated. I feel cheated that n o t h i n g  happened. I&#x27;d like my money back. I am going to their offices on Madison Avenue to complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never trust this company again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rip off.</li>
    <li> I think this is working somewhat. I do not particularly like the taste. My lipstick over it doesn&#x27;t seem to want to stay on as long either. I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Best of Both Worlds but just cut to the chase and go for The Lip Fusion Advanced XL. WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am not sure when I ordered this product, but I did like it and am planning to reored it.</li>
    <li> This is more of a lip gloss than anything else. I do like it because it&#x27;s not real sticky and my lips are quite soft. I think I was expecting a little too much when it comes to the plumping part. Did not notice a difference. If you&#x27;re looking for a good lip gloss this is definitely it.</li>
