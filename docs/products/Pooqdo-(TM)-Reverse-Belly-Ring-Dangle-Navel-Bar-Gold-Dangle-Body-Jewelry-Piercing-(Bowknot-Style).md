      <li>Really cute and super easy to put in</li>
      <li>Super cute but tarnishes in a matter of days</li>
      <li>yes , but the quality of the belly ring is SOO CHEAP like almost plastic feeling ..</li>
      <li>I know the price is cheap, but I was hoping for a quality product, which I did not receive.</li>
      <li>I knew it was cheap</li>
      <li>Then The Original Date ,</li>
      <li>Other than that it was beautiful</li>
      <li>Then wore it too many times and my belly button started getting really irritated and was in a lot of pain</li>
      <li>Really cute, very fashionable.  </li>
      <li>but it tarnishes quickly.</li>
      <li>so I use a normal one on top and a reverse on the bottom.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very comfortable and not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>yeah right .</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look right either ..</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s different yet cute .</li>
      <li>Exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s in the picture</li>
      <li>It fits so well and looks exactly like pictured.</li>
      <li>It turned within 1 day the whole ring .!</li>
      <li>but I thought I would get more than one wear out of it especially after waiting 3 weeks for it.</li>
      <li>Looks exactly like the pictures.</li>
      <li>Look exactly like the picture though and is pretty.</li>
      <li>and it rusted within the first wear.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t take long at all love it</li>
      <li>The bottom of my belly button is pierced and it&#x27;s very hard to find cute top dangles.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Got rusty really fast</li>
      <li>This belly ring was well packaged and came very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>Would recommend and it came really fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a regular Amazon buyer and there products over all are cheap ...</li>
      <li>just got this the other day love the belly rings from amazon.</li>
      <li>Came weeks early looks Just like the picture but does tarnish very fast</li>
      <li>I still thoroughly enioy this piece and highly recommend if you are Ohkay with it getting a rustic look eventually.</li>
      <li>it rust super quick and didn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
      <li>I definitely got my moneys worth.</li>
      <li>but it is way too top heavy to stay in place.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Dont mistake this to be a normal ring though.</li>
      <li>Seriously the cutest belly button ring i own.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The top hangs down so it has gotten stuck or just hurts things in general a lot.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected and fast delivery</li>
      <li>so I clear coated it before I wore it</li>
      <li>recommend clear coating the metal and gems</li>
      <li>but it came weeks early.</li>
      <li>I have had it in for a about a week now to see how my skin would react to it, because i have fairly sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It arrived weeks early .</li>
      <li>I got it in the mail two days early</li>
      <li>This is a really cute belly ring,but once I got it and started wearing it,after about two weeks,a gem fell out of one of the dangling pieces,and it started tarnishing..very cute,but very,very cheaply made..total disappointment.!</li>
      <li>im surprised it&#x27;s actually sturdy</li>

<li> The only thing is it seems tarnished already after wearing it only a few days</li>
<li> If looking for a little something for the beach or a vacation/trip definitely go for it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. I see a lot of negative reviews saying it looks funny and sits weird. BUT reverse belly buttons are meant for the lower navel piercing not the top! I have both so I use a normal one on top and a reverse on the bottom. So I strongly suggest getting this if you have a lower belly button piercing :) or if you don&#x27;t care!</li>
    <li> This belly ring was well packaged and came very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend clear coating the metal and gems so they don&#x27;t change colour and the sparkle doesnt fade.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very comfortable and not heavy at all. I really like it alot.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> it rust super quick and didn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this ring! It&#x27;s so cute and super comfortable! The only thing is it seems tarnished already after wearing it only a few days so I would suggest it for occasional wear instead of daily</li>
    <li> thank so much for this product EXCELLENT.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s in the picture but when I received it it had turned a dark color in some places.</li>
    <li> This looks great when you get it but it tarnishes quickly. The fold looses shine on the chain around the bow, and around the hanging diamonds.</li>
    <li> The bottom of my belly button is pierced and it&#x27;s very hard to find cute top dangles. This one is so cute and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t hang weird and isn&#x27;t too long that it gets stuck in my pants. So happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I liked it but it turned brown after like my 2nd day of wearing it, and it was a little big for my naval holes. Other than that it was beautiful</li>
    <li> Really cute, very fashionable.  Got lots of compliments on it. Would recommend and it came really fast.</li>
    <li> Pretty bad when you wear it don&#x27;t for a day and not get it wet and all the color rubs off. Never again. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It a beautiful ring... But I got a refund on it when j never asked for it to be refunded.</li>
    <li> I wore it a couple times and the gold looks worn off/tarnished. Cute but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Worn it for a week with out taking it out still the dangles aren&#x27;t broken im surprised it&#x27;s actually sturdy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really cute butt...... Got rusty really fast</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Looks just like the picture.</li>
    <li> Came weeks early looks Just like the picture but does tarnish very fast</li>
    <li> Hate it..change colors in 2 days</li>
    <li> Came much earlier then expected. Very nice jewelry.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never buying something like this again . It turned within 1 day the whole ring .!</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this at first! Then wore it too many times and my belly button started getting really irritated and was in a lot of pain so I tossed it, kinda faded too(color wise). If looking for a little something for the beach or a vacation/trip definitely go for it! But if your looking for something to last longer than a few months, stay away. Head to the shop in the mall instead.</li>
    <li> It is a cute ring, but after just a couple days of wear it started changing colors and looking almost rusted. I know the price is cheap, but I was hoping for a quality product, which I did not receive. I would look elsewhere if you are looking for a good quality, long-lasting ring.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite belly button ring and I would definitely buy another.</li>
    <li> it rusted and faded after a week</li>
    <li> MY belly button ring after a few months it changed colors into a rusty color now I&#x27;m scared to even wear it because it might get rust inside my belly button ring hole. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Seriously the cutest belly button ring i own. It fits so well and looks exactly like pictured. Dont mistake this to be a normal ring though. It is reverse or top dangle.</li>
    <li> It was so beautiful but it came in br</li>
    <li> It looks just like the picture but when took it out after wearing it for a couple days it started getting rusty</li>
    <li> I was not a fan of this belly button ring!&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the idea of it but it is way too top heavy to stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;The top hangs down so it has gotten stuck or just hurts things in general a lot. You can see it through clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material wasn&#x27;t bad, just the design sucks.</li>
    <li> just got this the other day love the belly rings from amazon.</li>
    <li> I Took a shower with this in and it instantly tarnished. I understand that you get what you pay for but I thought I would get more than one wear out of it especially after waiting 3 weeks for it.</li>
    <li> I knew it was cheap so I clear coated it before I wore it and it rusted within the first wear. Look exactly like the picture though and is pretty.</li>
    <li> I got it in the mail two days early yes , but the quality of the belly ring is SOO CHEAP like almost plastic feeling .. It doesn&#x27;t look right either .. Don&#x27;t waste your money .. The pictures make it look amazing .. 😒 yeah right . I&#x27;m a regular Amazon buyer and there products over all are cheap ... Whatever not getting anymore of my money !</li>
    <li> i have had it on a week and it has already tarnished</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different. Not too happy with it but it came weeks early. But I can&#x27;t even get the ball off of it to put it on.</li>
    <li> Really cute and super easy to put in but it started to turn a sliver the next few days.</li>
    <li> I love it. But it started turning colors</li>
    <li> PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT I LOVE IT!! Will order more things from you guys again! ❤️</li>
    <li> This a very cute item....our teenager just loves it......I would purchase items from this seller again</li>

    <li> Ok quality for price but color did not meet my expectations</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like the picture</li>
    <li> Some Times My Orders Where Delivered Later Then The Original Date , But When It Came I Loved It .</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the pictures.</li>
    <li> I darling navel ring with the little bling</li>
    <li> Too cute ! It&#x27;s different yet cute . It arrived weeks early .</li>
    <li> I loved it at first . Now it&#x27;s all rusty . changed color in a matter of days</li>
    <li> Tarnished in a matter of days. I definitely got my moneys worth.</li>
    <li> It rusted very quickly and was very cheap.</li>
    <li> Discolored. Not what I was expecting when it was gold in the picture</li>
    <li> Hi it a beautiful belly button ring</li>
    <li> Amazing quality and it doesn&#x27;t get stuck on my clothes! I have had it in for a about a week now to see how my skin would react to it, because i have fairly sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother at all! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> tarnished and looked brown after less then a week</li>
    <li> Only issue is it changes color when it gets wet, but that&#x27;s obvious cause its not pure gold.</li>
    <li> My jewelry was missing the bottom ball</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful but all 3 I bought have now tarnished and look horrible :(</li>
    <li> Poorly made, I waited three weeks before it came. The &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; faded after one night and made my belly button itchy! I always buy belly button rings from amazon and they were great but never will I buy from that company again</li>
    <li> Love the piercing but took for ever to come</li>
    <li> It arrived 8 days before I expected it. And it&#x27;s beautiful! Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wear I got it now I love it</li>
    <li> It faded after wearing it for 4 days.</li>
    <li> I wish I could return and get my money back . It changed colors after 3 days , one of the chains broke ... Just bad .</li>
    <li> This is a really cute belly ring,but once I got it and started wearing it,after about two weeks,a gem fell out of one of the dangling pieces,and it started tarnishing..very cute,but very,very cheaply made..total disappointment.!</li>

    <li> i never even got my bellyring &amp; now the picture on here isnt even a bellyring its a phone case !!!!</li>
    <li> Looks nice at first but after a while when I showed it becomes rusty. Now it&#x27;s in the trash! Waste of moneg</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Gold fades after a few times getting wet. I still thoroughly enioy this piece and highly recommend if you are Ohkay with it getting a rustic look eventually.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take long at all love it</li>
