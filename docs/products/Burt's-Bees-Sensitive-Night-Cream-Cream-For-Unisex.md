<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A little on the liquids side, but effective.</li>
    <li> The best night cream I know of right now. Seller fine. Good transaction. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> the best night cream for sensitive skin like mine.  no fragrance and super-hydrating.</li>
    <li> Best price I have see anywhere for this wonderful skin care line. This is the best Burt&#x27;s Bees skin cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but this cream unfortunately didn&#x27;t work out for my extremely sensitive/eczema-prone skin. As those with sensitive skin know, we need to buy products created especially for our type skin, and paraben-free and fragrance-free helps quite a bit; and this product fortunately fits all of those critera. I just got this cream to use during the dry, cold months. I spread it on after washing my face and shortly afterward noticed a touch of tingling and discomfort, which, as those with sensitive skin know, isn&#x27;t a good sign! I checked the ingredients and this still has some that can be irritating, including cetyl alcohol. The next day, I had some very dry eczema splotches from my face. So just a warning to those with super sensitive/eczema-prone skin - this might not be the best product for us!</li>
    <li> I expected a night cream and received a day lotion that should have been in a bottle. This cream if far too watery to be considered a night cream. I did enjoy that it had little to no scent, but it also had little to no moisturizing capability.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I have a severe allergy to soy which is in so many products. I finally found a night cream that works for my allergies and sensitive skin. My skin has never looked so great!!</li>
    <li> I just love the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive line of products. It&#x27;s the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t make my paraoral dermatitis around my chin area flare up.</li>
    <li> This night cream is much lighter than most other overnight creams, presumably because it omits the ingredients that are likely to irritate very sensitive skin. It goes on smoothly and without fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t provide the heavy-duty moisturizing that other night creams do, but it keeps my skin from drying out, even in winter, and never irritates. (My skin is extremely sensitive.) The advantage of the lightness is that it can be used as a daytime moisturizer as well, if you don&#x27;t need sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible. Not good for sensitive, oily skin.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s bees sensitive line are great skin care products that I have come across. This night cream moisturize my face really good without greasy residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a fan of Burts, but I&#x27;m not sure why they call this a cream. The consistency is not thick like a cream, which makes me wonder why they even put it in a jar. Not a fan of this one.</li>
    <li> Creamy but not too thick love this range really soothes my skin</li>
    <li> Ack!!  This might work if my skin was super oily, to suppress the oil secretions, but it is not.  It may be that the zinc in it makes the cream feel drying?  After having it on for about 5 minutes, I had to go wash it off because it felt like I had on a clay mask!!  It is great though that it is unscented and not too greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a gift and it is just the right size, Burts bees has some great products.</li>
    <li> Nice cream with little to no fragrance. The only thing is that it&#x27;s very light and more of a lotion, so if you are looking for a traditional thick cream this isn&#x27;t it. But it leaves your skin very soft.</li>
    <li> As a long time user of Ponds cold cream, I wanted to switch to a more natural, paraben free moisturizer. I am a big fan of Burts bees products and so chose this cream as it was thick and most like the Ponds consistency. I loved it for about 4 days until the breakouts started. I am not a person prone to breaking out, so I was very surprised. I&#x27;m really disappointed as I wanted to like and use this cream. I thought that given the Burts Bees name and price, it would have performed much better. I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> It arrived perfect and I was dying to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It feels so gentle and easy on the skin. Airy almost.</li>
    <li> it was a great product but it should be thicker in my opinion and it is great for my eczema all over. It is over priced for the size and the container is slippery and spilled all over the place. But over all it was a good product</li>
    <li> Love it! Esthetician Instructor that has used many products... I have drier skin with occational break outs and love this creme. Might be too heavy for some for day use but I use it for my morning moisturizer too!</li>
    <li> So soft and gentle. I wake up without oil on my face and feeling fresh. I have such sensitive skin that everything makes me break out at first, but not this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for 2 jars now... and I like it. I have noticed, though, that maybe I need a little thicker cream. I have extremely sensitive, very dry&lt;br /&gt;skin and have just started using the sensitive skin cleanser by Burt&#x27;s bees, which may be why I am feeling a little dry. I am trying Neutrogena Naturals Nourishing Night Cream next.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin. I love this fragrant free light weight face cream..it feels so..clean and healthy on my face.  I.have the face wash and wipes too. Ill b. Reordering it. I also will try other products that are fragrant free. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I had some pimples after using this cream. It&#x27;s not good than I expected.I don&#x27;t recommend this. I think it&#x27;s too rich.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive so I exfoliate at night and this leaves my face with no redness in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be trying the day creme next.</li>
    <li> I really expected more moisture from a night cream.  It was kind to my sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t hydrate enough.</li>
    <li> This cream is absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I swear by this cream. I have gone through 3 containers already and don&#x27;t see any reason to stop using it. I love all burts bees products, but this one has to be (by far) my favorite. The cream is light, but still super moisturizing. It is easy to travel with because the container does not leak, and it is under 3 oz. I travel to Colorado a lot, where the air is super dry and it is cold. I ALWAYS bring this cream with me because it is the only thing that will properly moisturize my skin without breaking out in that area. I use this in the summer, Winter, Spring and fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have SUPER sensitive skin, and this stuff does not break me out or cause an allergic reaction. It is not greasy or heavy, yet it does an amazing job moisturizing. I love this cream!</li>
    <li> Perfect for very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this cream works great!  It keeps my skin lightly moisturized, doesn&#x27;t give me acne, and makes my skin feel amazing in the morning.  After trying more expensive, ineffective creams, I&#x27;m going to keep buying this one.  Can&#x27;t beat the price or the quality!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin.  I have used the daytime lotion for about six months, and so far, it was the only lotion that I had been able to use without breaking out; thankfully, this nighttime lotion also works well with my skin, and does not irritate at all.  The product is quite thick, but still light enough that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel clogged-- it definitely continues to work all night.  It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, and takes away quite a bit of the redness and irritation</li>
    <li> I have problematic skin - it breaks out with almost every product I&#x27;ve tried - so I was hesitant to use a night cream even though I really needed the extra moisture for my dry skin in the cold winter months.  I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for a month or so with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Goes on smooth but with some slip so it works well for a before-bed facial; absorbs quickly and completely; VERY lightly scented with a pleasant smell and I barely notice it now because it&#x27;s so light and because I&#x27;ve gotten used to it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can be hard to travel with due to container sometimes not &amp;#34;locking&amp;#34; tightly and because if tipped upside down the contents settle against the lid so opening it can be messy</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensetive skin and unfortunately around last year my skin began to be allergic to EVERYTHING! Therefore I had to toss out all my Clinique, Chanel, and other expensive facial products. I been on a hunt for a while and this non-fragrant product was the first to not make my face become allergic.. Yay to one of the few non-allergic night cream out there!</li>
    <li> I had very dry, cracking eyelids.  I used this for several consecutive nights and it cleared it up.  Now, I use it whenever I start to get dry on my eyelids and I wake up the next morning with my eyelids back to normal.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks now at night.  The cream is very light and goes on really smooth but cakes/clumps up in the lid which I have to clean out every few days.  The cream is almost water-like, and did not leave my skin greasy but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this specific cream again because I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent or the consistency.</li>
    <li> my wife use that very well</li>
    <li> Love how lightweight and nongreasy it is. Very thin consistency. Keeps my skin hydrated overnight. I use this night cream with a combination of other Burts Bees products, both sensitive label and non sensitive label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I took off one star: packaging! The cream isnt so much creamy as it is very thin and liquid-y. Be careful when you open the jar, always upright. If you get the cream on the lip of the jar, be sure to wipe it off before screwing on the top or you will get a crust on your jar.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything its advertised to be. It&#x27;s light but creamy and moisturizes extremely well without irritating my sensitive skin. No scent or dyes, goes on smooth and the jar is pretty big. I don&#x27;t need to use a lot in one go so it should last a while, as well. I&#x27;m very impressed. I&#x27;ll definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> Not for sensitive or regular skin at all. My mom bought this and she had a reaction to it and gave it to me. I don&#x27;t have have sensitive skin but usually use the normal BB night cream just fine. So I used this and within a week, my entire face was filled with bumps and it felt like I had a toothache everywhere. The skin on my hands peeled and also turned red wherever I touched. If you actually have sensitive skin, I would find something else. Also, it has a watery consistently not at all like a cream and smells like alcohol.</li>
    <li> I usually love Burts Bees. I have used their Sensitive Skin lotion for years.  I thought a night cream would be good as I live in the mountains and am getting older so want to prevent wrinkles. I broke out with terrible acne from this cream. It is also very thin...runny like the lotion. In fact even thinner than the lotion. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I know that it is night cream, but it was too thick for my skin. Even being a sensitive formula it still made me break out.</li>
    <li> The best skin cream for sensitive skin, hands down! I &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34; and wear it during the daytime too, I love it so much. It is light and not the slightest bit greasy. It absorbs readily and leaves your skin soft and clean-feeling. Sensitive skin can be touchy, but with this cream, I&#x27;ve had no breakouts, no inflammation or redness, no blackheads - just beautiful, clear skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was a thick over night cream for eczema but it is a overnight face cream</li>
    <li> It is very smooth and feel so soft on my skin and it does not feel itching on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll edit this review in the future... maybe.. but as of now I can only give this product 3 stars because of my experience. Something went wonky between the delivery because the product was all over the box. The jar itself that it comes in is pretty heavy glass, which I appreciate. But there was a crack alongside of it that cause it to leak out. Also, the lid itself screwed off EXTREMELY easily as if it was loose. I&#x27;m not sure if this normal? The size was a little smaller than expected, and the product is also thinner than I thought it&#x27;d be. I tried a small part of it on my hand but will not put it on my face. It has a mild scent, like rice (one of it&#x27;s ingredients). It didn&#x27;t irritate my hand and there&#x27;s no perfume-y kind of scents. So far I like it but I&#x27;ll have to wait to tell.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin amazingly soft and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a much bigger fan of the sensitive skin night cream. The consistency is kind of runny and the scent is subpar. Not one of their better products.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer because it is reasonably priced, it comes with a good quantity per bottle, and is usually moisturizes with one application (except on those really dry days in the winter). My only complaint is that it is supposed to be for sensitive skin but it stings my eyelids and the skin around my eyes, which is the most sensitive skin of all. I have had this problem with their sensitive skin face wipes too so there must be something I can tolerate in the formula. This moisturizer also takes a little longer to absorb than others, sometimes I will have white streaks on my face for 2 minutes - just like with sunscreen. The absorption time is a non issue since it is a night cream and there is no waiting to put makeup on. Besides the stinging around my eyes this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Many creams are hard on my face, particularly the eye area, because I have sensitive skin.  This cream is nourishing and does the job.  It absorbs nicely, and keeps my skin young and radiant looking.</li>
    <li> For the most part I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but I have to agree with the reviewers who have said this product is &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;. A nighttime moisturizer is typically a cream, not a lotion. This product is so thin it really ought to be in a pump-bottle, not a jar (I could tilt the jar and watch it run). I couldn&#x27;t differentiate this from the corresponding daytime moisturizer, and was disappointed it wasn&#x27;t richer. That aside, it works fine with my level of sensitivity -- I don&#x27;t struggle with eczema or anything severe like that, but I usually react to cheap or harsh products. Its not my new favorite, but I might buy it again if I catch a good sale, since at least I know I won&#x27;t break out.</li>
    <li> Very nice, light moisturizing cream. I am very happy with it. I do notice less redness with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders on me and leaves my face as soft as anything for the morning. I like it so much now that I use this as a daily moisteriser as well, even though its a night cream. I think it works great under water based foundations (I use Loreal true match). Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Light, moisturizing, no smell, great for sensitive skin, and a very reasonable price.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The cream i ordered from Amazon was very thin, didn&#x27;t have any smell, didn&#x27;t seem to nourish my skin at all. I ended up throwing it away, i should have returned it but waited too long. I have been wondering if it was the real thing or a copy. I usually purchase Burt&#x27;s Bees in Walgreens and always really like their products.</li>
    <li> Very light, not greasy at all...perfect</li>
    <li> Got break outs the minute I started using. I stopped use and break out left. It&#x27;s just sitting in my cabinet. Oh well...</li>
    <li> Given as a gift to someone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s night cream for a while after I had an allergic reaction to a acne cream precisbed by my doctor. Really can&#x27;t stress enough how light this overnight cream is without a perfume smell. If you have extremely sensitive skin then this is a good line to go for. Recommend the daily routine with the other line of sensitive products they have out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product at all. I have sensitive skin and a few minutes after applying the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; (feels more of a thin lotion), my skin gets chapped with white skin flakes and dryness. When I wake up in the morning, my face was so chapped that I had more wrinkles that I never seen around my face before. I gave this product a try for a week and had the same dry results when I wake up in the morning. Not good at all for those with true sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Good deal, my niece love it</li>
    <li> For moisturizer doesnt do the job</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this cream. I normally love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and I am loyal to their lip balms. BUT. This cream just did not work. Moments after I put it on, my face felt and looked just as dry, if not MORE dry, than it did before applying the cream. It was useless as a night cream. My face was more blotchy and had more breakouts in the morning after using the cream than it ever had before. So yes, you read that right. The cream somehow managed to make my face both more dry and more pimply than it was before. Don&#x27;t know how you managed that one, Burt&#x27;s Bees. Also, the cream is heavily scented (like cotton, or something), which for a product that advertises itself as &amp;#34;sensitive,&amp;#34; is puzzling. Will not purchase again. In fact, I&#x27;m not even going to finish the jar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a pretty difficult time in the past finding a good night-time moisturizer/night creme because of my acne and sensitive skin, but this stuff works miracles. It instantly soothes my skin and takes away redness. When I wake up in the morning, my face always looks more radiant and less \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot;. I think I&#x27;ll stick to this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, but if you have oily skin I would not use it. I have extremely dry skin in the winter and I use it everynight.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> feels good on skin, absorbs right in -  maybe I need a little heavier cream, this is very light - does not irritate - will give it a few months before deciding if I order this again</li>
    <li> Great Product. Loved it.</li>
    <li> This cream is a fantastic DAY cream. It is so thin, and has such a mild pleasant scent.  It goes on very easily and soaks in quickly.  I can&#x27;t imagine using this as a regular night cream, unless you need a very very light cream. But I always thought people used night creams to get EXTRA moisture.  This is so light.  It&#x27;s lovely though. I may mix it with my SPF during the summer months.  It does not give me enough moisture in the daytime during these harsh winter days though.</li>
    <li> I saw this in the store and saw all the good reviews, EXCEPT the one that said \\&quot;not for eczema\\&quot;! If I saw that before I went to the store, I would NOT have purchased this product. I have red patches on my facial cheeks that were diagnosed dry patches. I used this cream the night before, but when I got up the next morning, the red patches were now maroon color and my face was burning. This is the only new product I have used that would cause this reaction. I did, however, love the silky, non oily feel of this cream, just not on my face. It comes in a 1.8 oz. jar and the cost is about 14- 16$.&lt;br /&gt;If you have red, dry patches, you need to move away from this product! One would think a cream labeled \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; would not cause redness or burning. Sadly, I cannot use this product.&lt;br /&gt;I did give this cream 1 star for the non-oily texture. I really wanted this product to work with my skin, but it didn&#x27;t&#x27;t work out that way. Sorry Burt&#x27;s Bees, you missed the mark on this product, at least for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd jar of this and I really like it so far. I&#x27;m 27, I have mild acne which occurred suddenly about a year ago, and so far this seems to really calm down the inflammation overnight without adding to the problem. It also keeps my skin hydrated pretty well.  The only thing I HATE is how expensive it is for such a small amount. I will continue searching for similar products at a better price.</li>
    <li> This just doesn&#x27;t moisturize my face. It&#x27;s too thin and watery. If your skin is dry, don&#x27;t bother with this.</li>
    <li> I get this through subscribe &amp; save and love it. I don&#x27;t use it conventionally however. Of course not! I have dry skin exacerbated by Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome; at the same time, I don&#x27;t like make-up. So I started using this cream during the day. Meanwhile, I was very frustrated by the lack of a true replacement for my Definity moisturizer (it&#x27;s no longer available). So I had the idea to add just a little liquid make-up to the Night Cream. It works very well! I&#x27;ll do the same with my next jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the moisturizing ability of this cream is excellent and I&#x27;d recommend it to all users.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this product and I have to say it helped me out with the dark circles under my eyesand I&#x27;ve never seen a more better improvement and I will be buying more so I can continue to receive results and I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> this is a very nice, gentle cream. i didn&#x27;t get any skin irritation at all when using it. however, it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin the way i hoped it would. i have very dry, sensitive skin. i think it&#x27;s probably better suited for someone who has a more youthful complexion.</li>
    <li> Too many times I&#x27;ve purchased face products for Sensitive Skin only to get perfumed filled greasy creams I can&#x27;t use.  This one is neither.  Although it&#x27;s called NIGHT cream, I use it during the day.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to find day cream without sunscreen in it, so NIGHT cream is about the only thing I can find.  Even with my past Melanoma, I don&#x27;t want sunscreen in my face cream.  Too many chemicals on the skin are NOT good.  That&#x27;s why I want my face cream to be my face cream and my sunscreen to be my sunscreen.  That way I&#x27;m the one who decides when to put sunscreen on my skin and when not to.</li>
    <li> There is just the right &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; to this night cream, non-greasy, pleasant smell, moisturizes well. All with little-to-no added chemicals! :-)</li>
    <li> All my life I&#x27;ve struggled with combination acne-prone skin. I&#x27;ve tried lots of products that worked, but only temporarily. I use this night cream in combination with Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin face wash (5 stars there, too).  I loved these fragrance free sensitive skin products from Burt&#x27;s Bees from the first use; however, I wanted to wait to use them for a full month before reviewing. After a month, I can truly say I can&#x27;t imagine changing to any other product. My acne is under control. My oily skin is much more under control. Even more amazing, I think my skin looks more beautiful without make-up now! I use this day and night since it&#x27;s not really oily. Their day cream wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me and left my skin feeling irritated, but once I exchanged it for the night cream, my life was changed! I did have one break-out during my most hormonal time of the month, but it was nothing compared to usual (or compared to what happened to my back and shoulders). I am now looking into buying more of their fragrance-free products for the rest of my body!</li>
    <li> I like this because its a light weight night cream.  I mix this with my RX of retinol because of peeling.  Perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin and sensitive eyes.  Great bargain!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It is the most lightweight cream I have found and what I love is that is soaks it quickly and no greasy feel. I like it so much I bought it for my sister and put in her stocking for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I break out to almost any topical lotion/cream/etc. that there is, even when it is for the face. With Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Night Cream, however, I don&#x27;t. I use this every night and I never have a problem. It makes my skin feel softer and look better. I will definitely keep buying this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s for years. This cream feels weird. I don&#x27;t like the texture. It&#x27;s a little runny to be a night cream in my opinion and it smells like cotton balls. I can&#x27;t say my skin is more moisturized after using it. My day cream seems to work better.</li>
    <li> thick, creamy, moist. not too oily, my skin soaks it up well. good for day and night. even work well under make up. perfect for my sensitive skin. doesn&#x27;t burn at all or cause redness on my skin like many other lotions and products do.</li>
    <li> Night creams are typically lush feeling on the skin as they are supposed to be for overnight moisturizing.  This is not a cream.  It is more of a lotion in a jar.  It is very water, and not much of a moisturizer.  Very disappointing for Burt&#x27;s, which is never inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This cream is great for sensitive skin without clogging pores, causing acne or leaving an oily feeling to your skin. I use this both day and night.</li>
    <li> I have terribly dry skin, along with rosacea and very mild adult acne. I have tried so many different night creams, some were like heavy paste and clogged my pores while others were like watered-down lotion. I just started using this a week ago and already like the feeling of it on my face. Can&#x27;t tell yet if it&#x27;s working...Will try to update in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;***Note: I had tried Burts Bees Hydrating Night Cream with Sage but it just seemed to irritate my rosacea and was not hydrating enough to calm the flaky skin on my cheeks :-( Hope this cream works better for me.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I used, it is very good, no redness and oily feeling. My skin is sensitive.</li>
    <li> I like this night cream from Burt&#x27;s Bees!  It goes on silky smooth! My skin breaks out sometimes even when I don&#x27;t use lotion or cream on my face but using this stuff every night I have NOT had any pimples yet and I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months....</li>
    <li> Arrived early. This is a great product if you&#x27;re allergic to most other beauty products but still live somewhere dry and want a light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have difficult skin, to put it mildly.  I have rosacea, am prone to pimples, and am now beginning to see fine lines. I have tried many night creams that have failed to help one or all of these issues.  This calms my redness, plumps my skin, and keeps it clear.  Couldn&#x27;t love it more.</li>
    <li> This cream is rich and smooth with a very light, pleasant, naturally smelling fragrance. It has yet to cause any irritation to my hyper sensitive skin, even when I apply it after an irritating cleanser. My skin feels dewy after application and buttery soft once the product fully absorbs. A little goes a long way!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice light night cream for sensitive skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product and quality. Ordering again for sure.</li>
    <li> I have to rosasea and no medicine or expensive creams helped me however Buurt&#x27;s Beees Sensitive night cream if I have a clean face red disappeared really is an excellent cream I recommend</li>
