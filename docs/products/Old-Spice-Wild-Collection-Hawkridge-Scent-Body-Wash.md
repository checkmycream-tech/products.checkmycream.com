      <li>This body wash is fantastic!</li>

      <li>One star off because the top cap could be made of a more durable plastic.</li>

      <li>i love shopping on amazon.</li>
      <li>This seemed to be more focused on the cologne aspect than the soap.</li>
      <li>Its a mellow smell that is very soothing and pleasant.</li>
      <li>Smells very good and very different.</li>
      <li>Has a good smell but doesn&#x27;t seem to lather very well.  </li>

      <li>Good quality soap, good smell, the cap broke but not much of a problem, I just need this soap to shower, not to display it in the bathroom.</li>

      <li>This body wash along with the same deodorant​ has gained me a reputation among my friends as the one that smells good.</li>
      <li>My husband loves this body wash, only kind he will use.</li>
      <li>i love the smell of old spice body wash.</li>
      <li>but this brand is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>Didnt buy it here but still worth a review.</li>
      <li>Have not got it yet but did already get 2 other things in this scent and it is such a great smelling product!</li>
      <li>Hawkridge is much more \\&quot;relaxed\\&quot; and nice smelling, then the usual \\&quot;manly\\&quot; and \\&quot;cool\\&quot; smelling scents.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful new scent from Old Spice, my new regular.</li>
      <li>Denali its a masculine scent which to me smells like a light musk with tonka bean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Was buying locally and paying more.  </li>
      <li>The girls I&#x27;m with really like it,</li>
      <li>I recommend it to all real men.</li>
      <li>Others should be able to detect a slight pleasing smell if they get close, but the whole room shouldn&#x27;t smell like you, and that&#x27;s pretty much how this is.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an avid Old Spice user.</li>
      <li>This is my first experience using an Old Spice body wash, I like the scent but feel that its too overpowering.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice change of pace from what I usually wash with/wear.</li>
      <li>When squeezed on to a wet washcloth it soaps up well, cleans the skin effectively, washes off clean, and leaves that distinctive aroma for a few hours.</li>
      <li>If I could half it with some non-scent body wash it would be much more pleasing to use,</li>
      <li>So, if you&#x27;re worried about that, stay away from this particular</li>
      <li>The first few times I used it, it gave me a headache because of how strong the smell was.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended for nighttime use and on weekends.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
      <li>We normally but whatever</li>
      <li>though it smells similar to fresh collections</li>
      <li>That nice smell will radiate beyond that 36 inch &#x27;personal space&#x27; for a few hours.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Out of the 3 wild collection body wash scents I have tried this one is the nicest!</li>
      <li>It definitely has a more masculine scent than some of the other new ones, like Fiji for instance.</li>
      <li>still stays on after a long day and fresh as well.my family really likes this even after the next day</li>
      <li>what&#x27;s happening old spice why do we have to go to America for old spice</li>
      <li>Collection\\&quot; of Old Spice fragrances</li>
      <li>&quot; is from the \\&quot;Wild</li>
      <li>When people find out that it&#x27;s Old Spice they don&#x27;t believe me.</li>
      <li>(Old Spice \\&quot;Hawkridge\\</li>
      <li>but as far cleaning you, I found it lacking.</li>
      <li>It has a definite manly cologne scent to it, much richer in fragrance.</li>
      <li>It carries the classic old spice notes mixed with freedom and determination to be some ones role model.</li>
      <li>and it has a powdery smell with the basic Old Spice classic cologne fragrance underneath.</li>
      <li>I just prefer it to be a bit more subtle.</li>
      <li>By far the closest to actual old spice I&#x27;ve used from the body wash lines.</li>
      <li>The Old Spice Wild Collection Hawkridge Scent Body Wash is another totally different scent breaking from the line of Old Spice traditional scent.</li>
      <li>I am a very big fan of Old Spice all together</li>
      <li>, it dried my skin and you needed more than average amount.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This smells like a cologne based body wash. It shares some notes with L&#x27;Homme by Yves Saint Laurent. Smells very good and very different.</li>
    <li> This body wash is fantastic! It smells great, and it gets me clean. I recommend it to all real men. Fact!</li>
    <li> The Old Spice Wild Collection Hawkridge Scent Body Wash is another totally different scent breaking from the line of Old Spice traditional scent. I like this one. It definitely has a more masculine scent than some of the other new ones, like Fiji for instance. It has a definite manly cologne scent to it, much richer in fragrance. It still foams up quite well and the scent is in long lasting. It did leave me feeling refreshed and invigorated enough to write about it!</li>
    <li> Smells great for a long time and a great price too. I would buy this over and over and plan too as well</li>
    <li> + Great fragrance during and after shower&lt;br /&gt;+ Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;No complaints. This is simply a great shower gel for men!</li>
    <li> Product was good. Price was way too expensive.</li>
    <li> Has a good smell but doesn&#x27;t seem to lather very well.  For the price you get a big bottle so overall it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this body wash, only kind he will use. He likes that it rinses clean, doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your skin. We both like the way it smells. Price is good on here too.</li>
    <li> Its a mellow smell that is very soothing and pleasant. It is a must for a college bro ! !</li>
    <li> I am a very big fan of Old Spice all together but this brand is by far my favorite. It smells like you could dominate someone in a poker game while surrounded by loyal screeching hawks. It just smells awesome and I love it.</li>
    <li> Great smell pity couldn&#x27;t but it in the uk what&#x27;s happening old spice why do we have to go to America for old spice</li>
    <li> Hawkridge is my favorite scent, because It reminds me of a unique eurpean cologne that sticks around all day. My girlfriend loves smelling my chest since i started using this. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great! This body wash can not be bad! Have not got it yet but did already get 2 other things in this scent and it is such a great smelling product! Just the perfect notes! My hubby WILL get a bit extra attention &amp; i WILL be getting a bit closer when he is wearing it!</li>
    <li> Loved Old Spice as a teenager and looking for one with that great scent.  It is not this one although it is otherwise an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid Old Spice user. Was buying locally and paying more.  I&#x27;ll be buying here as long as I can.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using an Old Spice body wash, I like the scent but feel that its too overpowering. Others should be able to detect a slight pleasing smell if they get close, but the whole room shouldn&#x27;t smell like you, and that&#x27;s pretty much how this is. In fact, the first time I used it my father sneezed when I walked past, and he not a the sneezing type. When I can smell it on myself after a long day to the point I&#x27;m offended and have a headache, I know its going to be overwhelming to others. If I could half it with some non-scent body wash it would be much more pleasing to use, at the very least I&#x27;ll rinse off much longer when using it.</li>
    <li> i love the smell of old spice body wash. hawkridge has a unique smell that turns heads. i love shopping on amazon. it is so convenient having your purchases dropped off at your house.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks.  It smells just like the deodorant.  The deodorant stinks too.  They should make all this stuff smell like the Hawkridge antiperspirant.  I&#x27;d buy it for life.</li>
    <li> This is the only body wash I use. I will drive out of my way to get it. It reminds me of a man honey nectar that is flown up to to your olfactory glands by hawks who just finished showering themselves. You should buy it. Now. You should buy it now.</li>
    <li> The smell is great but VERY overbearing. The first few times I used it, it gave me a headache because of how strong the smell was. I&#x27;m going back to the Denali scent for now. It&#x27;s still some good stuff though. I just prefer it to be a bit more subtle.</li>
    <li> Great smell that will attract all the females.</li>
    <li> Five ATTRACTIVE Stars! \\&quot;Hawkridge\\&quot; is from the \\&quot;Wild Collection\\&quot; of Old Spice fragrances and it has a powdery smell with the basic Old Spice classic cologne fragrance underneath. That nice smell will radiate beyond that 36 inch &#x27;personal space&#x27; for a few hours. With the \\&quot;Hawkridge\\&quot; name, one might expect a more musky fragrance, but that is not the case from this OS body wash. When squeezed on to a wet washcloth it soaps up well, cleans the skin effectively, washes off clean, and leaves that distinctive aroma for a few hours. Highly Recommended for nighttime use and on weekends. Five FRAGRANT Stars! (Old Spice \\&quot;Hawkridge\\&quot; fragrance body wash in a 16 fluid ounce/473 mL squeeze bottle.)</li>
    <li> It smells good but I wished it lathered more for applying on the body. The smell stays with you for a while and gives you a clean feeling.</li>
    <li> still stays on after a long day and fresh as well.my family really likes this even after the next day</li>
    <li> Good quality soap, good smell, the cap broke but not much of a problem, I just need this soap to shower, not to display it in the bathroom. One star off because the top cap could be made of a more durable plastic.</li>
    <li> Great value and great body wash!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite body washes.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful new scent from Old Spice, my new regular. I would consider this the polar opposite of their swagger stick and wash. Hawkridge is much more \\&quot;relaxed\\&quot; and nice smelling, then the usual \\&quot;manly\\&quot; and \\&quot;cool\\&quot; smelling scents. The girls I&#x27;m with really like it, but I know a handful of guys who don&#x27;t want to worry about not smelling \\&quot;manly\\&quot; enough. So, if you&#x27;re worried about that, stay away from this particular scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice change of pace from what I usually wash with/wear.</li>
    <li> This seemed to be more focused on the cologne aspect than the soap. I wasn&#x27;t really impressed. The smell is nice and it&#x27;s like a cologne that sticks to you but as far cleaning you, I found it lacking. It just didn&#x27;t lather well, it dried my skin and you needed more than average amount.</li>
    <li> My go to body wash. This stuff smells absolutely amazing. This body wash along with the same deodorant​ has gained me a reputation among my friends as the one that smells good. When people find out that it&#x27;s Old Spice they don&#x27;t believe me.</li>
    <li> Bear glove smells like candy pepto bismol, Wolfthorn is VERY strong but grew on me a peculiar potent ocean breeze scent BUT HAWKRIDGE though it smells similar to fresh collections Denali its a masculine scent which to me smells like a light musk with tonka bean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the 3 wild collection body wash scents I have tried this one is the nicest!</li>
    <li> Smell is amazing, but the price is outrageous. Go with the 3-pack for $7 more, it a much better deal and it comes quicker</li>
    <li> excellent product, well priced.  Hard to find in the marketplace.</li>
    <li> Didnt buy it here but still worth a review. By far the closest to actual old spice I&#x27;ve used from the body wash lines. It brought back memories of a simpler time of when men were men and skinny jeans were for women. It carries the classic old spice notes mixed with freedom and determination to be some ones role model. This scent create the desire to go outside, and create something from nothing but power tools and sweat.</li>
    <li> I love when my husband showers just so I can smell this.  It is a very nice scent!  We normally but whatever but this is a smell we will be sticking with for a long time!</li>
