<ol>
      <li>was just around 1.75 inches that these would have been perfect to store in</li>
      <li>She is very happy with the item.</li>
      <li>Works very good on removing contacts.</li>
      <li>It worked great, but one of the protective plastics came off, so I searched stores and the internet for a replacement.</li>
      <li>the rubber tips fall off during use which kind of defeats the purpose.  </li>
      <li>Came quick, was cheap and works great!</li>
      <li>Are very easy to use.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>Better than using my finger..</li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>that one had its tip finely grind-ed.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t come with a case, but fit well in a prescription pill container.  </li>
      <li>but now they don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
      <li>These are great for women with long nails as it prevents you from scratching your eyes.</li>
      <li>Just keep them clean</li>
      <li>They are the perfect tool for taking my soft daily lenses out without damaging my cornea</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to grab contacts with my fingers, the mini tweezers work perfectly and don&#x27;t damage the contacts.</li>
      <li>Made it so much easier to get my contacts out of the case, love em.</li>
      <li>If you have astigmatism and your contact lens tech had to order a tighter then normal fitting lens to keep the lens from  sliding to the side of your puple</li>
      <li>They really help to avoid getting fingerprints and lint on my soft lenses, so they are easier to insert and more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth buying.</li>
      <li>Love to pick up my contact lens without touching them with my hands less dirt and germs</li>
      <li>/&gt;Small enough to fit in a contact lens caddy and just a very useful item.</li>
      <li>I do try to use my fingers first.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have been much happier!</li>
      <li>Since the tweezers is so cheap, free shipping would not apply and the price doubled due to shipping costs.</li>
      <li>My contacts will really hold on to my eye.  </li>
      <li>So much cleaner this way.  </li>
      <li>Other than that they are okay tweezers to use with contacts.  </li>
      <li>Nice and small for carrying in a purse, but big enough to manipulate easily.  </li>
      <li>but in fact they were a little more than 2 inches.  </li>
      <li>These short ones do work, but you must be carefully more delicate and precise while removing and holding onto the lens.</li>
      <li>The longer one is worth the extra cost!</li>
      <li>I gave this to my son who is new to wearing contact lenses.</li>
      <li>one just have very rough tip, making the rubber condom indispensable.</li>
      <li>These were bought to help me remove soft contacts from my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I have an eye condition that warrants the use of hybrid lenses (rgp inside, soft outer skirt).  </li>
      <li>I tried to remove my problem lens with these tweezers a number of times and the soft plastic tips just slide around and can&#x27;t get a grip on the lens.</li>
      <li>I found it strange as here in the U.S. we just use our fingers to insert and remove our soft contacts, but this is how she has always done it</li>
      <li>My last resort was Amazon and with a little searching I found these mini tweezers which is an exact replacement for the one I had been using and which broke</li>

    <li> These little tweezers have a clear rubber tip that don&#x27;t harm your contact lenses.  I use them to pick up my lens, hold them while I rinse them off, and then place them on my finger tip to put them in.  Using these makes a lot less finger prints on the lenses!  So much cleaner this way.  :)</li>
    <li> I love these.  They really help to avoid getting fingerprints and lint on my soft lenses, so they are easier to insert and more comfortable.  Previously it would often take me several tries to get my lenses on without grit or scratchiness, but not anymore!  Nice and small for carrying in a purse, but big enough to manipulate easily.  They don&#x27;t come with a case, but fit well in a prescription pill container.  Helpful seller too.</li>
    <li> I had one tweezers like this before, it was from a contact kit. that one had its tip finely grind-ed.&lt;br /&gt;This one just have very rough tip, making the rubber condom indispensable.</li>
    <li> This was bought for my Step Daughter who is here visiting from Russia.  Her mother misplaced her tweezers.  I found it strange as here in the U.S. we just use our fingers to insert and remove our soft contacts, but this is how she has always done it so I purchased them for her.  She is very happy with the item.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. It&#x27;s hard to grab contacts with my fingers, the mini tweezers work perfectly and don&#x27;t damage the contacts.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend who always rips his contacts.  Totally worth buying.</li>
    <li> Love to pick up my contact lens without touching them with my hands less dirt and germs</li>
    <li> These were bought to help me remove soft contacts from my eyes.  My contacts will really hold on to my eye.  The trick I&#x27;ve learned is to place an eye lubricant in my eye for about 5 minutes then use the tweezers to remove the contacts.  I do try to use my fingers first.  I&#x27;ve torn a lot of contacts using tweezers and my contacts are suppose to last for a month.  PS.  They don&#x27;t!  ( I get into a big hurry to get the things out)</li>
    <li> Could not use it. It did not grab lense, it just scraped across my eye, leaving it sore and very red.</li>
    <li> I have an eye condition that warrants the use of hybrid lenses (rgp inside, soft outer skirt).  I am finding my hybrids harder to handle because they like to stick to the sides of the contact case.  These takes care of that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small enough to fit in a contact lens caddy and just a very useful item.</li>
    <li> Works very good on removing contacts. I had a hard time removing them but the teeszers work wonders. Are very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I could not find these mini tweezers anywhere on this island!!!  My optometrist could not locate such a device and some optometrists said this kind of thing is dangerous to use and only fngers should be used to handle contact lens.  My last resort was Amazon and with a little searching I found these mini tweezers which is an exact replacement for the one I had been using and which broke (it&#x27;s plastic).</li>
    <li> Disappointed...  Waited a month to receive the product &amp; of the 4-tweezers that I ordered... only (2) had the rubber tips on them upon arrival.  Also-- the rubber tips fall off during use which kind of defeats the purpose.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My optometrist once gave me a tweezers to use for removing my contacts from the case. It worked great, but one of the protective plastics came off, so I searched stores and the internet for a replacement. Since the tweezers is so cheap, free shipping would not apply and the price doubled due to shipping costs. I found this set of three would cost the same to ship as one, so I ordered the set. Unfortunately, the tweezers, being so short, do not have the rigidity to hold the contact easily as the long one does. These short ones do work, but you must be carefully more delicate and precise while removing and holding onto the lens. If I&#x27;d have known, I&#x27;d have bought the longer one and eaten the shipping cost. I&#x27;d have been much happier! Don&#x27;t fret the shipping! The longer one is worth the extra cost!</li>
    <li> Worked like charm! love it</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son who is new to wearing contact lenses. Just keep them clean and you should have no problems.</li>
    <li> I use them every day. They are the perfect tool for taking my soft daily lenses out without damaging my cornea</li>
    <li> Made it so much easier to get my contacts out of the case, love em.</li>
    <li> I bought these tweezers thinking they would be 1.5 inches and they are not that size.  The site does say approximate size which I thought would be really close to 1.5 inches but in fact they were a little more than 2 inches.  I have a case to carry things in that was just around 1.75 inches that these would have been perfect to store in but now they don&#x27;t fit.  It should say 2 inch tweezers instead.  Other than that they are okay tweezers to use with contacts.  Still pretty disappointed since I bought them for the case.</li>
    <li> Came quick, was cheap and works great! These are great for women with long nails as it prevents you from scratching your eyes.</li>
    <li> If you have astigmatism and your contact lens tech had to order a tighter then normal fitting lens to keep the lens from  sliding to the side of your puple then this probably won&#x27;t help. I tried to remove my problem lens with these tweezers a number of times and the soft plastic tips just slide around and can&#x27;t get a grip on the lens. So I&#x27;m back to pushing the lens around with my finger and trying to pinch it with two fingers, leaving me with a sore eye.</li>
    <li> It is convenient for people to take their contact lens and it helps me a lot without wasting a lot of time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s get the job done! Better than using my finger..</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could remove my contacts. Almost impossible to do. I would not recommend this product for contact lens removal.</li>
    <li> They arrived and looked like they would work wonderfully due to the soft rubber tip. I bought them to put IN my contacts but tried for over a half and hour and only succeeded in irritating my eye. If you buy these and can figure out how to use them please leave comment so I can try again.</li>
