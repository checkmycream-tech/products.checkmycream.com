### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Of course the reviews claiming wonderful results overnight are fakes.  </li>
      <li>Excellent customer service &amp; seller, they answer promptly when you write.</li>
      <li>the results already are remarkable!</li>
      <li>This Derma roller is great</li>
      <li>Works great, using on my face to tighten.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchases</li>
      <li>Great idea...</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>Honest!</li>
      <li>I just want to thank Amazon and those who created this product for someone like me and others who cannot afford laser treatments to use this great product at an affordable price because if I had to do laser treatments my scars will still be in my face and this is doing a very good job in eliminating mostly all of them.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t feel good, hence not using it weekly.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>So glad I dove in!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that it comes with interchangeable heads</li>
      <li>Hopefully this roller will give me a good surprise :)</li>
      <li>To be honest i m kind of scared</li>
      <li>but this is not the kind of texture I want for my skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see that being effective with people with hair cause</li>
      <li>but this is not the kind of texture I want for my skin.</li>
      <li>I kinda think this is a scam to be honest with you.  </li>
      <li>Okay, so haven&#x27;t been real good about using this weekly since I received it, so really can&#x27;t give an opinion as to if it works or not.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen HUGE results across my forehead and under my eyes!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>I suggest you do more research than I did and look at some dermatology sites.</li>
      <li>Oh and I watched a video on YouTube just to make sure I was doing the rolling correctly.</li>
      <li>I’m sure results will vary depending on your skin type</li>
      <li>Used 2 months and still waiting for lines around mouth to get better.  </li>
      <li>Love it.....</li>
      <li>I’m sure results will vary depending on your skin type</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>MOST REVIEWS FIR</li>
      <li>And I have seen results in my skin using a top rated vitamin c serum from amazon</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I would say they are slightly better.</li>
      <li>I am very excited about this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very durable, easy to clean and it has its own plastic container and cloth bag...which are nice to have so that we don&#x27;t lose the pieces or damage the pins.</li>
      <li>I prefer to let it soak in alcohol before and after use and the tray has a reservoir that makes it easy to do</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even need as much concealer any more!</li>
      <li>With the allure of “more &#x3D; better” in terms of anti-aging, it’s too easy to overdo these types of tools and create real problems for your skin.</li>
      <li>DIDN&#x27;T RECEIVE FREE AS</li>
      <li>I even use a light moisturizer after before applying makeup.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I have really good skin, but wanted to have my vitamin C serum absorb more deeply into the skin.  </li>
      <li>so far so good</li>
      <li>Very pleased so far.  </li>
      <li>Clean, quality item.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already purchased 2 more bottles of the Pure Hyaluronic Serum because Amazon runs out from time to time.</li>
      <li>This Kit Derma Roller is great and the delivery was faster than expected.</li>
      <li>All the everything that is seen comes in good condition, well packaged with a cute little pouch.</li>
      <li>Everything in the kit seemed to be good quality; had nice case for main roller and covers for separate attachments, and nice drawstring storage bag that was large enough to fit a small spray bottle of alcohol that I use to sterilize the roller.</li>
      <li>An unusual amount of the 5 star reviews were written by people who received the roller free for a review.</li>
      <li>The only suggestion I could make about the construction is that it would be nice if the plastic carrying case it comes with were sealable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 58 years old and have tried many products before Derma rolling.</li>
      <li>So far, after many uses, the Derma Roller seems to be maintaining its integrity, with no bent needles or anything.</li>
      <li>The pic in the right is today without filters.</li>
      <li>On a positive note, the overall quality of this particular model is of good quality.  </li>
      <li>Will certainly buy again!</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery and an affordable price considering the range of benefits gained from this product.</li>
      <li>Boyfriend notices his skin is softer and deep wrinkles are getting better</li>
      <li>Got my rolloer today looks exactly like pics.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first but</li>
      <li>It works Absolutely!</li>
      <li>Try this first.</li>
      <li>Item well packaged and comes with a lovely felt pouch and case  for the different size tips.</li>
      <li>/&gt;“Derma rollers are mostly about creating the next skin-care industry gimmick, and they really hurt when used as directed!</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t use too much pressure if you were only doing once a week you would have to put more pressure.  </li>
      <li>and it appeared to have positive reviews. .  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery and seems to be working so far.</li>
      <li>After rolling I use Witch hazel for toning and then apply Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
      <li>I have large pores and have battled with the texture of my skin for years.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>We really like the roller and faithly use it 2 times a week.</li>
      <li>My whole face stung</li>
      <li>Very prompt shipping,</li>
      <li>Hurts, I think, even when you&#x27;re fairly careful and due to that I don&#x27;t use it with the regularity that you need to see great results</li>
      <li>I had severe acne as a teenager that left significant scarring on my forehead.  </li>
      <li>better than expected !</li>
      <li>I have only used 3 times but I can already tell a significant difference in age spots, pores and lines.  </li>
      <li>The next morning I looked at my face in natural light in a magnifying mirror.  </li>

      <li>We highly recommend this roller.</li>
      <li>Ok, I wanted to try out Derma rolling a few weeks before writing a review.</li>
      <li>so i order numbing cream for help and that i will get in few more days.</li>
      <li>Right now I can only comment on the product, too soon for results.</li>
      <li>I suggest you do more research than I did and look at some dermatology sites.nd very little redness.</li>
      <li>Um, this thing has needles which you roll on your face to obtain higher absorption of your facial products.  </li>
      <li>My skin has not looked so fresh in a long time.</li>
      <li>so there are &amp;#34;filters&amp;#34; actually softening my face haha).</li>
      <li>This is the only product from which I can see real improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>I use the .5mm single-row roller under my eyes on the soft tissue there, the 1.0mm on my cheeks and chin and the 1.5mm across my forehead.</li>
      <li>, the “needles” appear to be blades not round needles, a sign of an inferior product.  </li>
      <li>I mean I have hair but could do with some more.</li>
      <li>he swears that he can see new hair growth but only time will tell.</li>
      <li>The after effects are redness and a mild sunburn-like sensation, which goes away after a few hours.  </li>
      <li>The procedure itself isn&#x27;t entirely unpleasant, feels like a light tingle, with a few pinches on the more sensitive areas of my skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used 2 months and still waiting for lines around mouth to get better.  I would say they are slightly better.</li>
    <li> After looking at a large and confusing array of derma rollers I chose this one because it had three different size heads and it appeared to have positive reviews. .  THEN (I can’t believe I’m saying this) I went back and took a closer look at the reviews.  An unusual amount of the 5 star reviews were written by people who received the roller free for a review. They are required, by law, to disclose this but there are devious methods to get a “verified purchase “stamp on the review.  Of course the reviews claiming wonderful results overnight are fakes.  Even if the roller does work for you it will take weeks or even months to show results according to the articles I read.  To quote one article:&lt;br /&gt;“Derma rollers are mostly about creating the next skin-care industry gimmick, and they really hurt when used as directed! In fact, we think the pinprick pain these devices can cause is worse than how laser or light-emitting treatments feel (and believe us, we know!). With the allure of “more &#x3D; better” in terms of anti-aging, it’s too easy to overdo these types of tools and create real problems for your skin. Derma rollers are one anti-aging skin care fad you can skip!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to some instructions you should roll the roller, without lifting, in a vertical direction, then horizontal, then diagonally in both directions.  This can snag the skin at the at the end of the stroke , possibly going in the same holes again. With the diagonal strokes you are getting a heavier concentration of holes where the strokes cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my personal experience:&lt;br /&gt; The roller arrived promptly and seems sturdy enough. No “needles” were bent. I don’t have a microscope but looking at the roller under a magnifying glass, the “needles” appear to be blades not round needles, a sign of an inferior product.  If I’m wrong I apologize.  I sterilized the roller and carefully cleaned my face and used an antiseptic wipe. There was really no pain and very little redness. I applied a vitamin “C” serum then a moisturizer after use. The next morning I looked at my face in natural light in a magnifying mirror.  It had the texture of an orange peel!  Four days later I can still see the indentations across my forehead. I’m sure results will vary depending on your skin type but this is not the kind of texture I want for my skin. If this enables your skin to absorb skin treatment products why wouldn&#x27;t it absorb cosmetics or anything else you put on it? If you still insist on using a derma roller I suggest you do more research than I did and look at some dermatology sites.nd very little redness.

    <li> Amazing! Super fast delivery and an affordable price considering the range of benefits gained from this product. All the everything that is seen comes in good condition, well packaged with a cute little pouch. Will certainly buy again!</li>
    <li> We purchased the roller to help treat my husband&#x27;s hair loss. We really like the roller and faithly use it 2 times a week. We&#x27;re taking pictures once a month to see if there&#x27;s any improvement....he swears that he can see new hair growth but only time will tell. We highly recommend this roller. It&#x27;s very durable, easy to clean and it has its own plastic container and cloth bag...which are nice to have so that we don&#x27;t lose the pieces or damage the pins. Great product!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and seems to be working so far.</li>
    <li> This Derma roller is great I do see a lot of my dark scars on my face fading away.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  I just want to thank Amazon and those who created this product for someone like me and others who cannot afford laser treatments to use this great product at an affordable price because if I had to do laser treatments my scars will still be in my face and this is doing a very good job in eliminating mostly all of them.</li>
    <li> got red face after use，and my skin feel pain</li>
    <li> Everything in the kit seemed to be good quality; had nice case for main roller and covers for separate attachments, and nice drawstring storage bag that was large enough to fit a small spray bottle of alcohol that I use to sterilize the roller.</li>
    <li> New to derma rollers but not new to minor procedures to improve wrinkles etc. Everything from chemical peels to restalin injections. Right now I can only comment on the product, too soon for results. It came in sterilized packaging and seemed to work as advertised. No bleeding but tingling afterward. Used a serum with vitamin c on it afterward. Did notice couple white heads following morning. Also used on my spider veins on legs.Will update in few weeks with results. There is debate about whether there should be bleeding but if you are only puncturing the dermis there should NOT be bleeding.</li>
    <li> better than expected !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. DIDN&#x27;T RECEIVE FREE AS MOST REVIEWS FIR MY UNBIASED OPINION. MAY FEEL DIFFERENT ABOUT IT THEN.</li>
    <li> Love it! Seems to be making such a difference to my skin texture</li>
    <li> So far so good. Boyfriend notices his skin is softer and deep wrinkles are getting better</li>
    <li> Very pleased so far.  Item well packaged and comes with a lovely felt pouch and case  for the different size tips. It really is a bit uncomfortable but not painful on the face area I use the 1.0 on face, I guess if you were to put more pressure while rolling of course that will be painful. I chose to do it 3 times weekly so I don&#x27;t use too much pressure if you were only doing once a week you would have to put more pressure.  Skin gets red but disappears within a few hours.  Will continue using I hope to get rid  of or at least see an improvement with my stretch marks. As for hair loss I mean I have hair but could do with some more. I tried it I don&#x27;t see that being effective with people with hair cause no matter what I did it tangled in my existing hair. If a person was bald I could see you being ale to use in hair for hair loss.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have the miracle affects on me unfortunately.  Returned it</li>
    <li> Love it... Not the easiest to do and it&#x27;s not a overnight miracle  treatment, but with consistency I do think it will work... I will post an update, if permitted.</li>
    <li> Tried it once and see a slight difference in skin tone.</li>
    <li> Try this first. stimulates circulation left me glowing</li>
    <li> This is the only product from which I can see real improvement in my skin. It forces my system to repair the minor damage caused by the needles. My skin has not looked so fresh in a long time. Great idea...</li>
    <li> Slightly prickling at first but nothing painful.  Have been using for several weeks and am seeing slight results.</li>
    <li> As expected. Clean, quality item. Excellent customer service &amp; seller, they answer promptly when you write.</li>
    <li> Um, this thing has needles which you roll on your face to obtain higher absorption of your facial products.  NEEDLES!  I used it twice and hated it.  I have really good skin, but wanted to have my vitamin C serum absorb more deeply into the skin.  My whole face stung and I had a couple of bubbles that looked like they had pus in them.  They are now gone, because I refuse to use this thing ever again.  I kinda think this is a scam to be honest with you.  I&#x27;m sticking to my routine that has worked for years.  Thanks to this little device, I realize if it ain&#x27;t broke - don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s does not hurt as bad as you think. If you can get a tattoo you can def. do this! And I have seen results in my skin using a top rated vitamin c serum from amazon</li>
    <li> Very prompt shipping, so far so good I&#x27;m happy with my purchases</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2-1/2 weeks now, every other night. I plan to continue this often for another week and a half then reduce to twice a week than once a week. I&#x27;ve seen HUGE results across my forehead and under my eyes! The pic on the left is 15 months ago, (from my Instagram so there are &amp;#34;filters&amp;#34; actually softening my face haha). The pic in the right is today without filters. Just standing in front of a window. I use the .5mm single-row roller under my eyes on the soft tissue there, the 1.0mm on my cheeks and chin and the 1.5mm across my forehead. I also use the 1.5mm on a variety of surgical scars that were lumpy/puffy/raised and they are definitely &amp;#34;flattening out&amp;#34; already. Highly recommend this product. So glad I dove in!</li>
    <li> I have only used 3 times but I can already tell a significant difference in age spots, pores and lines.  I am very excited about this product.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and I see no change in my skin.  Let me preface this by saying, I have awful skin.  I had severe acne as a teenager that left significant scarring on my forehead.  I have large pores and have battled with the texture of my skin for years.  I have had laser resurfacing and have tried a lot of peels and scrubs and paid ridiculous amounts of money hoping for a miracle.  Well, this is not it. The procedure itself isn&#x27;t entirely unpleasant, feels like a light tingle, with a few pinches on the more sensitive areas of my skin.  The after effects are redness and a mild sunburn-like sensation, which goes away after a few hours.  For a couple of days afterwards, my pores actually seem larger... unless these are the puncture marks from the needles I&#x27;m seeing.  That wouldn&#x27;t bother me if I felt like it was making a difference in the overall scheme of things, but I don&#x27;t.  There has been no change in the texture of my skin, the size of my pores, or the severity of my acne scarring.  This is way too big of a hassle not to see any results. On a positive note, the overall quality of this particular model is of good quality.  It&#x27;s nice that it comes with interchangeable heads and they all come packaged in sterile wrapping.  So far, after many uses, the Derma Roller seems to be maintaining its integrity, with no bent needles or anything. The only suggestion I could make about the construction is that it would be nice if the plastic carrying case it comes with were sealable.  I prefer to let it soak in alcohol before and after use and the tray has a reservoir that makes it easy to do but, since the case doesn&#x27;t seal, you can&#x27;t soak it and then carry it for travel and have it remain sterile.</li>
    <li> This Kit Derma Roller is great and the delivery was faster than expected. Sorry for the delay in answering but I&#x27;ve been dealing wit h some personal  stuff. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Works great, using on my face to tighten.</li>
    <li> Okay, so haven&#x27;t been real good about using this weekly since I received it, so really can&#x27;t give an opinion as to if it works or not.  I can tell you...it doesn&#x27;t feel good, hence not using it weekly.</li>
    <li> Love it.....once you start using this you won&#x27;t miss a treatment</li>
    <li> Hurts, I think, even when you&#x27;re fairly careful and due to that I don&#x27;t use it with the regularity that you need to see great results (I&#x27;m guessing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger that&#x27;s made for your body, you also have to be careful or you will find yourself bleeding.... these are needles, albeit short but they are very sharp.</li>
    <li> Got my rolloer today looks exactly like pics. But not sure what will works for me. To be honest i m kind of scared so i order numbing cream for help and that i will get in few more days. Hopefully this roller will give me a good surprise :)</li>
    <li> Ok, I wanted to try out Derma rolling a few weeks before writing a review. It&#x27;s wonderful! It actually works! Honest! I was hesitant at first but I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;a believer. I&#x27;m 58 years old and have tried many products before Derma rolling. Actually I&#x27;m shocked. I&#x27;ve been taking pictures and the results already are remarkable! After rolling I use Witch hazel for toning and then apply Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum. &amp;#34;It combats dryness and aging skin while providing balanced moisture to rejuvenate skins youthful glow&amp;#34;. I even use a light moisturizer after before applying makeup. I don&#x27;t even need as much concealer any more! I&#x27;m getting compliments on my skin and how I seem to be glowing. I love it. Oh and I watched a video on YouTube just to make sure I was doing the rolling correctly. I&#x27;ve already purchased 2 more bottles of the Pure Hyaluronic Serum because Amazon runs out from time to time. I&#x27;ve even used it on my under arm area and it&#x27;s working to tone it up! It works Absolutely!</li>
    <li> I love it. Altho it may take a few uses to see improvement but it maybe due to the careful use on my face.</li>
