      <li>Love the belly button ring but 2 days after I got it</li>
      <li>Its very cheaply made and will break off extremely easily.</li>
      <li>The belly button ring is extremely beautiful but the ball on top doesn&#x27;t stay on, I&#x27;ve had it for a week and fell off over ten times</li>
      <li>The cheap metal snapped at the top and I lost all the dangles.</li>
      <li>It breaks too easily.</li>
      <li>I can easily fix the ring</li>
      <li>Super cute coming out of the packaging.</li>
      <li>Very shiny and feels nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so pretty&amp; love how it sparkles when light hits it.</li>
      <li>Broke to fast gonna buy another one Super cute</li>
      <li>but it broke off way too quickly.</li>
      <li>Very pretty</li>
      <li>and you get what you pay for, its still very pretty.</li>
      <li>So pretty and exactly like the picture!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super cute, not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>Worth the wait.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super pretty</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s winter right now...</li>
      <li>Spend a little more for better quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty</li>
      <li>Kind of expected with the price I paid.</li>
      <li>, it is pretty how ever</li>
      <li>Not as pretty as the picture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty</li>
      <li>It is so pretty</li>
      <li>but it broke the first day I wore it</li>
      <li>My picture is kind of dark</li>
      <li>When I first saw it, it was very bright and sparkly but upon closer look on the right side of the pendent it is missing rhinestones not worth the price will be returning.</li>
      <li>Trying to gently reassemble it, each dangle began to break one by one.</li>
      <li>I wouldnt really recommend buying this for the reason it isnt made to be sturdy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super cheap so don&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
      <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing it for more than a few hours.</li>
      <li>Other than it being a cheap ring</li>
      <li>Lasted about 2 weeks before breaking the first time, 2 days the second.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately made very cheaply and the large rhinestone fell out the first time I wore it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as heavy as I was anticipating it to be.</li>
      <li>Arrived early.</li>
      <li>That only flaw that concerns me is the metal piece holding together the first diamond at the top to the rest of the piece is very weak and could be cause for concern.</li>
      <li>it broke on me on the first day and it leaves green stuff on your belly where it hangs.</li>
      <li>This is the second item I&#x27;ve purchased from this particular seller with the same issue, only the other product was $24.00.&lt;br /&gt;NEVER</li>

<li> Took a very long time to get here</li>

<li> I can only wear It for a few hours because after that, my belly button starts to hurt.</li>
<li> Really shows for poor quality on the seller&#x27;s part.</li>
<li> Be careful with this one.</li>
<li> Very heavy and bigger than I thought.</li>
<li> But I advise you to be very very careful when wearing it.</li>
<li> Several women said that they received theirs with missing gems, missing the belly bar</li>
<li> I had only wore it a few days and it started turning me green</li>
<li> Unfortunately the dangling portion broke off within the first few days, and is not something that can be glued or repaired.  </li>
<li> Differently a long belly button ring goes past the start of my pants</li>
<li> RUN THE OTHER WAY!&#x27;</li>
<li> so I haven&#x27;t been very active.</li>
<li> Too heavy and gaudy..  </li>
<li> Mine didn&#x27;t come broken nor is the ball loose.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been laying in bed and watching Netflix for the past week.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s very heavy.</li>
<li> but it gets caught on everything it pulled so hard on my jeans that it was making my piercing stretch a lot</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Arrived on time love it!</li>
    <li> Favorite belly ring ever! Love it! So pretty and exactly like the picture!!</li>
    <li> The quality (or lack of) of this product gets ZERO stars. The packaging and shipping speed earned itself a star. Super cute coming out of the packaging. I was WAAAY stoked about this! It even looks better than the picture. Unfortunately...I put the jewelry in and within 48 hours it had developed a green tint &amp; lost two rhinestones. Kind of expected with the price I paid. Then the entire thing broke. The cheap metal snapped at the top and I lost all the dangles. Trying to gently reassemble it, each dangle began to break one by one. I understand you get what you pay for...but this is ridiculous! Obviously I don&#x27;t recommend this product or the seller. This is the second item I&#x27;ve purchased from this particular seller with the same issue, only the other product was $24.00.&lt;br /&gt;NEVER AGAIN! RUN THE OTHER WAY!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Love the belly button ring but 2 days after I got it the big Diamond  fell out of it and it gets caught in every thing you wear</li>
    <li> Loved this belly ring but it gets stuck on clothing a lot!</li>
    <li> Absolutly love it!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice , I Love it 😍</li>
    <li> Very cute and I loved it. Unfortunately the dangling portion broke off within the first few days, and is not something that can be glued or repaired.  I don&#x27;t change my belly rings and this is probably something for occasional wear only.</li>
    <li> Some of the crystals broke off.</li>
    <li> Arrived early. I love it.</li>
    <li> I honestly wouldn&#x27;t buy this again it broke on me on the first day and it leaves green stuff on your belly where it hangs.</li>
    <li> Very, very cute. Unfortunately made very cheaply and the large rhinestone fell out the first time I wore it</li>
    <li> It broke in 2 days the dangle</li>
    <li> Good company and the purchase come really quick.</li>
    <li> It breaks too easily.</li>
    <li> thank so much for this product EXCELLENT.</li>
    <li> I wouldnt really recommend buying this for the reason it isnt made to be sturdy. Its very cheaply made and will break off extremely easily. I personally am not a big fan of it in person as I am of it in the picture but it isnt ugly. Its okay. which is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> The dangly part fell off instantly when I took it out of the package.</li>
    <li> I ordered this back in March and I still haven&#x27;t got it very disappointed</li>
    <li> The belly button ring is extremely beautiful but the ball on top doesn&#x27;t stay on, I&#x27;ve had it for a week and fell off over ten times</li>
    <li> It is so cute &amp; gorgeous. But I advise you to be very very careful when wearing it. I had mine for about two weeks and it broke twice!</li>
    <li> It came without a bar. It looks cute but it would be nice to wear it. Definitely returning</li>
    <li> Beware!!! I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before purchasing this belly ring. Now I wish I had. Several women said that they received theirs with missing gems, missing the belly bar or it broke within a week. Mine came backwards. If you were to put the bar in you belly button the gems would hang backwards facing your skin. Really shows for poor quality on the seller&#x27;s part. I can easily fix the ring but I shouldn&#x27;t have to. Other than it being a cheap ring and you get what you pay for, its still very pretty. So be warned that if you do purchase that you may receive faulty jewelry:/</li>
    <li> Broke to fast gonna buy another one Super cute</li>
    <li> It was off the hook--meaning it was fabulously beautiful.....and I would buy it again just to have an extra one..and I will tell others about it...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really pretty but it broke off way too quickly.</li>
    <li> Very pretty but this was my SECOND time buying it... Lasted about 2 weeks before breaking the first time, 2 days the second. Spend a little more for better quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really pretty but it gets caught on everything it pulled so hard on my jeans that it was making my piercing stretch a lot, it is pretty how ever but I never wear it because it gets caught .</li>
    <li> This is the cutest belly ring I&#x27;ve ever bought. Customer service is great.</li>
    <li> My order came in kinda late. But it looks exactly as pictured and it looks great!</li>
    <li> Got it for my girlfriend and it broke.</li>
    <li> The pictures do not do this thing justice. It is spectacular in person. That only flaw that concerns me is the metal piece holding together the first diamond at the top to the rest of the piece is very weak and could be cause for concern. Overall I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> It broke for no apparent reason the very next day. Not happy</li>
    <li> Very pretty but uncomfortable. Broke after a week.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it ! It&#x27;s so pretty&amp; love how it sparkles when light hits it. My picture is kind of dark but still I adore it.</li>
    <li> Too heavy and gaudy..  Never wear it</li>
    <li> Liked it but it broke the first day I wore it</li>
    <li> It is so pretty I love it! Differently a long belly button ring goes past the start of my pants but I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
    <li> Disappointed wish I could leave a lower review score. When I first saw it, it was very bright and sparkly but upon closer look on the right side of the pendent it is missing rhinestones not worth the price will be returning.</li>
    <li> Broke the next day, get what you pay for. Not as pretty as the picture.</li>
    <li> Be careful with this one. I had only wore it a few days and it started turning me green</li>
    <li> Very heavy and bigger than I thought. I can only wear It for a few hours because after that, my belly button starts to hurt.</li>
    <li> really great piercing, looks exactly like in the picture, came in before it was suppose too I recommend for anyone who is trying to look for a cute piercing &amp; also great for the price.</li>
    <li> It was broken when it got here.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super cute, not heavy at all. Mine didn&#x27;t come broken nor is the ball loose. i&#x27;m very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super pretty but it&#x27;s very heavy. I wore it for a few days without taking it out, and the weight of it made the ball actually start going through the hole which is obviously very bad. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing it for more than a few hours. It&#x27;s super cheap so don&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and loved it. Worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Took a very long time to get here but it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
    <li> great belly ring love that it dangles</li>
    <li> The belly ring is adorable but when i opened my package, it was broken! Im so disappointed..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really lovely! Very shiny and feels nice. It&#x27;s not nearly as heavy as I was anticipating it to be. I bought it to wear it with my bikini in the summer and it&#x27;s winter right now... So I can&#x27;t say how it reacts with the water yet. But im happy with it :) came in earlier than predicted and good quality!</li>
    <li> Okay so when I got this I loved this. It was incredibly beautiful. I had this for a week, and Its been snowing here so I haven&#x27;t been very active. I&#x27;ve been laying in bed and watching Netflix for the past week. And it broke in a week. Although it was beautiful I wouldn&#x27;t buy it, it breaks very easily.</li>
