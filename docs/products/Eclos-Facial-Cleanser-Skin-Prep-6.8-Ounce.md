<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really like this cleanser. I recommend to not use around the eye area if you&#x27;re sensitive.  Other than that, this keeps my skin clear and looking good. I use with the scrub.</li>
    <li> I use it daily. Refreshing clean smell. Don&#x27;t need to use much at all so it last for a good while.. I think that it helps with my skin so Il keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This completely dried my skin so bad, that when I put anything else on it burned. I coated my face in coconut oil and Vaseline two nights in a row and my skin is still not back to normal. My skin became flaky and red and rough. I look like i aged about 10 years overnight. Definitely returning to get my money back. And I find it convenient that nowhere on the box or the company&#x27;s website is there a phone number to call and report anything or ask questions.</li>
    <li> I have found very few cleansers that don&#x27;t leave my face red and irritated. Eclos Facial Cleanser seems perfect for sensitive skin. It also has a luxurious scent like products used at a spa. The scent is very relaxing and a bit addictive. What I noticed most while using this product is how clear my pores are. I also noticed that I look younger! Even after just two weeks of use I&#x27;m seeing more clarity in my complextion and my husband even noticed that my face looked different. He thinks it is becasue I lost weight but I think it is because I&#x27;m using this product. The ingredients in this product are the secret. It has Ginkgo Biloba, Turmeric and Green Tea which work on inflamation. Then there is Chamomile and Cucumber to hydrate and soothe the skin. Finally Gotu Kola gives the skin more firmness. You will really see a difference in your skin tone fast. Give this two weeks and you will be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I have a bottle of this facial cleanser on my sink and one in the shower.  The scent reminds me of products used in a luxury salon.  It is a great value for the money.  I asked for the whole line for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Great way to clean your face. Simple to use..</li>
    <li> This is a a really good cleanser without being harsh to your skin. Great for everyday use. You feel a good tingle. Noticeable less acne and oiliness when using this product.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product line you owe it to yourself to do so! I love my skin since I&#x27;ve been using the Eclos line! Not only are my wrinkles dissapearing, my skin has a youthful glow! LOVE IT!!!! Try it!</li>
    <li> I bought a starter kit of eclos and have been hooked on it since my first try.Love, love love it</li>
    <li> Best cleanser I have ever used.  Gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip.  It&#x27;s working wonders on my skin!  Non irritating.  Actually the redness I used to experience after washing my face before doesn&#x27;t happen with this product. I highly recommend trying it out!</li>
    <li> I only buy natural products for my face now.  I love this cleanser and the moisturizer by Eclos.  I use both everyday and I no longer get breakouts.  I just wish I would have known years ago that drying out your face and putting harsh chemicals on them was what was causing random pimples to pop up.  Since I have went to natural products and used moisturizer day and night my skin is so much healthier.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS CLEANSER!  FAST SHIP!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. After using many different cleansers this is my favorite. Your skin will look better and feel softer. I also love the facial cream. I keep an extra bottle, tub of both in my cupboard so I never run out.</li>
    <li> The vendor ships immediately and the content is in a secure box. Great price. I have shopped locally and it sells for double. This is my second or third time I order from this vendor and I am always pleased. I will continue to order. Eclos Facial Cleanser Skin Prep is an amazing product. It washes off your make-up and doesn&#x27;t leave a dry residue afterwards. I use it daily. I wash my face in the morning and in the evening before bedtime. I have used everything in the market and this stuff is the best nature can offer.</li>
    <li> This face soap is very gentle and leaves your face feeling clean and looking radiant. I noticed a difference the very first time I used it. My skin immediately looked brighter. I was so impressed I went online and purchased the whole line just after the first use. Unfortunately, the rest of the line is not that great, in fact not really good at all. I had been using Purpose for years now but as I am getting older (and so is my skin) I need something that will help me recoup that glow. This wash does the trick. I have mixed it with a regime that includes several other product lines. I also have very acne prone skin (at 33!) and this wash is gentle enough to not make me break out yet delivers a light amount of moisture. I was hesitant because the whole &#x27;plant stem cell&#x27; thing just seemed so gimmicky but this product in particular does deliver. Another plus is that I can use this to wash eye make-up off because it is so gentle and effective. There a few face washes Ive been able to do this with. Normally I would end up with stinging eyes and/or black residue all over my eye sockets.</li>
    <li> A great daily moisturizer.  The only downfall is that it dosn&#x27;t have SPF.</li>
    <li> I thought I had ordered the Eclos Cleansing Oil which I love but apparently wasn&#x27;t paying attention.  This was extremely drying and caused my skin to become red and flaky and break out.  I ended up throwing it away.  I will say that I absolutely recommend the Eclos Cleansing Oil, however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 2 years and will never plan to use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love Eclos face products!!  They smell amazing and do what they are intended without using chemicals.</li>
    <li> and this burned and irritated my face. Not recommended for use with the clarisonic or by anyone with dry skin. Especially not recommended for people with sensitive skin. I used it twice. It even dried out my hands when I tried using it as a hand soap so I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
    <li> Nothing bad in here.  This cleans your skin and has nothing that will irritate your skin.  It really calms the skin.</li>
    <li> I love Eclos. It really caters to my sensitive skin. Makes my skin soft and clean without allowing me to break out from a reaction. I will totally buy again. Clean and simple (pun intended).</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for a natural cleaner with a rejuvenating smell, that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out and would still remove eye makeup. My findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells wonderful. The plant based ingredients are refreshing day after day. Not a girly or masculine smell, just herbally and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;-removes makeup easily. The toner soaked cotton ball shows no makeup residue when used after this. This means no more makeup on the towels!&lt;br /&gt;-Goes a long way. I use about a dime size each night and it is more than sufficient. It&#x27;s basically a gel so it foams up nicely. I&#x27;ve been using it about 4-6 weeks and you can&#x27;t even tell there&#x27;s any missing from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Has been a little pore clogging for me. Not something I care for.&lt;br /&gt;-Drying. I was using a cleaner with salilyc acid previously (which wasnt drying) so this caught me by surprise.&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive, although it is good quality. This isn&#x27;t a watered down product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess if you don&#x27;t break out and you don&#x27;t get dry skin from this, then you&#x27;ll probably love it and give it a 5. Sad review for me since I really do like the product, just not one for me.</li>
    <li> I bought a 2 week kit at walgreens of the Eclos skin care products that actually lasted me longer than 2 weeks and I am sold.&lt;br /&gt;The skin prep cleanser and The Instant radiance facial scrub is my favorite but I really like it all.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it because I noticed a difference in my wrinkles and the softness of my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash.  Love their moisturizer too!  I have extremely dry skin at 35.  So far, these products have been helpful (will have to see what happens in the winter time!).</li>
    <li> So far, this is one of my favorite face washes I have purchased, and I have tried many brands. It completely removes all makeup and leaves my skin feeling very clean and refreshed, not too dry or tight. I am in my mid to late twenties, have combination skin that is somewhat sensitive and can get dry easily but this stuff is great. Would highly recommend it for women that want something that will cleanly remove makeup without being too harsh.</li>
    <li> For the first week or two it was working great but then I started breaking out around my jaw line. I switched back to cetaphil and it cleared up right away.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and am aging (48). These products have been great for my skin and neck. provide great cleansing without dryness. I also like the scrub and mask</li>
    <li> Amazing. Leaves skin soft and not overly dry.</li>
    <li> Bought because trying to find a product that is natural yet not heavy on my face and this product does all.</li>
    <li> absolutely love the product, but they need to improve the packaging, which has arrived damaged twice.  Common sense would suggest they use some sort of filler, rather than putting the plastic containers in a bigger box than needed</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful stuff. The best you can get for the price. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my super dry-prone skin and also doesn&#x27;t make me breakout--which I am also at times prone to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Just as I ordered.  Eclos is a great cleanser.</li>
    <li> It even removes my eye makeup!  Just a dime size dollop worked into my face and neck.  Leaves my skin clean and moist.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle of it.</li>
    <li> I live in Las Vegas and already have dry skin. Lately it has been getting really terrible. My regular products stopped working, it got so bad I was literally rubbing coconut oil on my face twice a day just to get some relief from the irritation. The best thing I had found that didn&#x27;t irritate me was Aveda&#x27;s Sensitive skin line and it was only halfway cutting it. Anyone who has used Aveda knows the cost of their products is much more than Eclos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw Eclos starter kit in Target and decided to give it a try. Nothing to lose. I cannot believe how great these products are when considering the cost! When I am short on cash I generally go for Nutrogena products, but I don&#x27;t usually have faith in drug store beauty products at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Eclos is every bit as good as Aveda (I actually prefer this line to Aveda&#x27;s) and you just can&#x27;t beat the price. My face is improving and I am very happy with the entire product line. The only exception I guess is the eye cream, which is pretty average as far as I&#x27;m concerned... but I am picky about eye cream anyway. They eye cream is not bad, it is just not exceptional. The rest of this line is absolutely exceptional. I would still recommend anyone give this line a try if they are looking for something new and less costly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for about two weeks now. I love it! I have noticed quite a change in my overall skin tone and texture. I am 25, and I have bad bouts of acne in the hollows of my cheeks, and around that time of the month, i always get a huge \\&quot;under skin\\&quot; pimple. You know, the painful, impossible to pop kind. This month, all I got was a tiny spot on my forehead, and I&#x27;ll bet thats because i dont always wash it thoroughly. It isnt over drying, and i noticed this morning that a lot of the dead skin on my face rolls off the morning after i wash my face before bead, which is awesome. My skin feels light and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, combination skin and purchased a trial kit that contained the cleanser, serum, scrub, and mask. Initially, my skin seemed to like these products so I eventually got the full-sized items. A few weeks into using the cleanser, I began experiencing very red, very irritated skin. I chalked it up to the change in seasons and drier, colder weather. My skin continued to decline over a period of about a month. My pores became larger, my skin even more sensitive, and I eventually experienced the worst breakout I&#x27;ve had in 15 years. I immediately switched back to my previous cleanser and my poor face is still recovering. The cleanser, and the rest of the Eclos products, went into the trash bin. I&#x27;ll never touch them again! Also, my fiance disliked the smell of these products so bad that he asked me to stop using them right away... I should have taken the hint. I&#x27;d give this cleanser a zero if I could.</li>
    <li> I have been using premoistened cleansing cloths because previous cleansers had been harsh or irritating to my sensitive skin. Not this stuff! I started using Eclos serum after falling in love with a sample. Then I tried the moisturizer and loved it too. So I tried this cleanser and was amazed at how gentle it was yet my skin felt clean, but not tight. Using the Eclos system has made my 47 year old skin look years younger after just 3 or so weeks of use: my skin is hydrated, little lines less noticeable, ruddiness calmed, and generally brightened. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I normally use Purpose brand cleanser because it&#x27;s gentle,  but this is my new substitute!  Not only is is gentle but WAY better at eye makeup removal! I use the 24 hour eyeliner and mascara and Eclos always gets it off first try! It also keeps my complexion great and never irritates or dries me out.</li>
    <li> works great on my sensitive skin - does not irritate my skin</li>
    <li> Received it as a sample from Ulta, and I loved it so much that I bought it on here. I have moderately oily, sensitive skin and my face likes to break out frequently, so it&#x27;s hard to find a face wash that&#x27;s gentle but effective. This stuff makes my skin feel so plump and smooth, and smells very clean and spa-like. I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant decrease in my acne, which is what I wanted in the first place. Would highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> Sometimes it feels like I&#x27;ve tried every single natural skincare product out there (Mychelle, Origins, Dermae, Eminence, etc.) but nothing ever seems to be quite right for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was buying a few random items in Walgreens one day and stumbled across the Eclos skincare line.  I figured, why not?  My current cleanser was failing miserably.  I bought the starter kit and fell in love with this face wash (the other products I was not impressed with, though the moisturizer worked fairly well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face was is perfect because it deep cleans but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling stripped away or dried out.  It is gentle enough to remove eye makeup as well.  I use it with the Clarisonic Mia and have seen fantastic results in my skin.  It helps fade discoloration, even out skin tone, and prevents blemishes.  I use it two times a day and never feel like my skin is agitated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that it is far more affordable than most other natural brands and works just as if not better than- I would recommend it.  The bottle also lasts quite a while.  I would suggest leaving it out of the shower, somewhere dry and away from water since water easily gets into the bottle and makes the product watery and bad.</li>
    <li> Works great with my Clarisonic Mia 2 and seems to last a really long time. My face is much clearer than with other face washes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to read the reviews and find that not everyone had the horrible reaction to this cleanser that I did! It burned my face. I bought it because it was anti-aging, and the fact that it was plant-based was appealing. I have sensitive, combination skin. And though I am 47, I am break-out prone. After using this cleanser once, my face was blotchy and irritated. But I tried it again the next day - wish I had not. Red, angry skin that was burned! I ditched it of course, but by that night a dry layer had formed (yes, I used a gentle moisturizer afterward), and my face had broken out horribly. Thank goodness someone recommended I get Avene Cicalfate cream to heal it - that saved my skin! See my review of the Cicalfate cream, which I bought here on Amazon Prime. Beware of the Eclos cleanser...something in it caused a terrible reaction, it is NOT good for all people with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> The whole line is wonderful! Can&#x27;t say enough great things. Hydration, smoothness, and wonderful skin after 1 day. Does&#x27;nt get much better than this. I am 58 now, going on 20 after one day of using this whole line! Get the travel kit, has everything to start and wow, what a marvelous present to yourself! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Great product, leaves your skin clean and with a refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It cleans my face well without making it feel dry. I have used Cetaphil for years without complaint, but when I started running out of the sample size I had of the Eclos skin prep, the Cetaphil wasn&#x27;t enough anymore. I will keep both around and alternate. I feel like my skin is clearer and a get less blemishes in my chin with the Eclos. Also, you can really feel anti aging products being pulled deep into your skin when you use the skin prep cleanser.</li>
    <li> Not happy that the product arrived already opened and used.</li>
    <li> The best facial cleanser on the market.</li>
