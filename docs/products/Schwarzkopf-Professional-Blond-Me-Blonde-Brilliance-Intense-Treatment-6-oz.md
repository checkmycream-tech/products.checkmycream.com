      <li>I have used EVERYTHING to try to repair, most only repairing for a bit then going right back to damaged looking.  </li>

    <li> This is worth the money,  if you get your hair highlighted it will help extend the life of the highlights!</li>
    <li> Not amazing but not bad either.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very oily. I have fine hair but it really did a number on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend - great results, great value! This product is a nice once a week Tx to repair your blonde tresses.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time today and although I only had time to leave it in for 5 minutes, the minimum, I loved the final result. My hair is super shiny and bouncy, looking better than it has in months! The fragrance is delicate, nothing too strong.</li>
    <li> for the price, i just wasn&#x27;t pleased. The smell isn&#x27;t anything to write home about (not bad but not really that amazing- reminded me a little sauve). as far as conditioning goes, i thought it was like a regular conditioner- i use bedhead and get similar feeling results.</li>
    <li> No difference noticed after using this several times</li>
    <li> This is good, but not a real thick consistency like I was expecting.  Dont care for the packaging; having to dip my fingers into the conditioner container because you will end up getting some water in it.  Prefer a squeeze tube or bottle.</li>
    <li> When I wash my hair with just shampoo it feels dry, after using this I immediately notice a difference. I use this at least once a week and it has made my hair nice and soft. I do not notice any difference in color, but it does look a little shinier.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner on my over processed damaged hair and I can absolutely tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I have an arsenal of hair products, and this is definitely my go-to for deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;I use it often.</li>
    <li> Very nice hair mask. Its not too heavy and makes my hair super soft. Delivery was really fast as well. Giving 4 stars just because sometimes I feel my blonde hair needs extra deep mask and that one seems a little too light after a while.</li>
    <li> This isn exceptional mask.  It makes my heavy highlighed, blonde hair feel stronger, as well as conditioned and moist. great for blondes</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally around a \\&quot;7\\&quot; (dark Ash Blonde), but I had it died to a dark brown/coppery color for a while.  Since I decided to go back to blonde, I have encountered many disasters - the first at the salon, where - after 2 times 40-minutes with a 40 Volume (!!!!!!), and a \\&quot;toner\\&quot;, I ended up with NEON ORANGE BLOTCHY HAIR!.  I took to the internet to educate myself, and will do my hair on my own from now on, for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) TONING: I first went with Wella T18 \\&quot;White Lady\\&quot; Toner and a 20 Volume for 30&#x27;.  That helped a little.  Then, I did further research and found the Schwarzkopf products and will never use anything else!!! They are top-notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used both their Bonacure and Blonde Me Purple shampoos, which are both the deepest purple you can imagine and amaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing for shampoos.  There are plenty of reviews on these products, so no need for me to repeat here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) LIFTING DARK AREAS: I did a tester of a few strands of the really dark orange stuff, to try and bring it all to one level before toning again.  I used the Igora Blue dust-free bleach, mixed 1:2 with ONLY A 10-VOLUME TONER. Because my hair is already very fine, and had been processed so much, I read that for lifting (ie - bleaching), it is much less damaging to use a lower volume developer and leave it on longer. This lifted the dark areas out nicely.  I repeated this (a few days later and after much conditioning) with the remainder of the dark orange areas. This process took those portions of my hair all the way up to a very pale creamy yellow blonde. Because I used low volume developer and mixed it with deep conditioner, it did minimal damage to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also waited several days to one week between any processes, and deep conditioned after every shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************NOTE:  to bring a 30 Volume down to 10 Volume, you can mix the 30 Volume 1:2 with a conditioner.  I used the Schwarzkopf BC deep conditioner to mix this product.  For example (for small area, such as highlighting):&lt;br /&gt;10 grams bleach with ~21 grams of 10 Volume &#x3D; 1:2 Ratio bleach to developer.&lt;br /&gt;21 grams of 10 Volume &#x3D; 7 grams of 30 Volume + 14 grams conditioner (Zero Volume)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to follow the instructions on your product; all the Schwarzkopf and Blonde Me products are designed to be used together. ************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) FINALLY:  after getting everything close to a consistent color, I used the Blonde Me Toner in \\&quot;Steel Blue\\&quot; (for banishing Orange).  I mixed one tube (~56 grams), with 7 Volume Toner 1:1, as directed.  Again, I got the 7 volume by mixing a 20 volume 1:2 with conditioner. I USED ALL BLONDE ME PRODUCTS for this step, including their deep conditioner in a tub. I processed for 30 - 45&#x27;, then rinsed/ shampooed, and conditioned with ApHogee 2-minute conditioner (left on for ~15\\&quot;), which left my hair soft and silky!!! This is one of the few products that I will use in my repertoire that does not have the Schwarzkopf name on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are amazing!  My hair is a lovely, creamy, soft, wheat-ey blonde.  The colors all blended in very nicely, and for the first time in a long time, I actually LOVE my hair again!  You can see some natural variations in the tone,  so it is not all one color, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly: NO ORANGE!!! which is exactly what this product was supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like it to be whiter, but I will be patient and gradually bring it up a few highlights at a time over the next months/ years. The next time I need to tone, I am going to try the Blonde Me Toner in \\&quot;Ice\\&quot; (for banishing yellow :-),  formulated as described above. Or maybe mix the \\&quot;Ice\\&quot; with the \\&quot;Steel Blue\\&quot;, depending on how much Yellow/ Orange I see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blonde Me, Igora, Bonacure, and other products in the Schwarzkopf line are SIMPLY AMAZING PRODUCTS THAT SAVED MY HAIR!!!  THANK YOU!!!e (for small area, such as highlighting):&lt;br /&gt;10 grams bleach with ~21 grams of 10 Volume &#x3D; 1:2 Ratio bleach to developer.&lt;br /&gt;21 grams of 10 Volume &#x3D; 7 grams of 30 Volume + 14 grams conditioner (Zero Volume)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to follow the instructions on your product; all the Schwarzkopf and Blonde Me products are designed to be used together. ************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) FINALLY:  after getting everything close to a consistent color, I used the Blonde Me Toner in \\&quot;Steel Blue\\&quot; (for banishing Orange).

    <li> I&#x27;m brunette, and unfortunately have dull damaged hair, probably because I have to wash it every day. Ends are very dry and damaged but roots are oily so looks awful the next day. A friend of mine advised me this mask. I must admit that it is much much better than even Sensay Kanebo, which was four times expensive! With this mask my hair look much better, more shiny, silky and I don&#x27;t have to wash it every day! It has good smell and texture. I would advise it to everyone</li>
    <li> Smells good. I think it worked.</li>
    <li> Repaired me broken damaged hair!! It&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> My hair has been processed with bleach so much it is dry, brittle and breaking.  I have used EVERYTHING to try to repair, most only repairing for a bit then going right back to damaged looking.  This stuff really works.  My hair is getting better and better everyday.  The more often I use the better it is.</li>
    <li> Made my highlighted hair darker, but was very conditioning....just didn&#x27;t want to darken my hair, so returned it.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see that when this item arrived that there was no seal on the container. I thought that was a little sketchy, but it&#x27;s likely just how the product is sold. It&#x27;s good, makes my hair feel super soft. I like some of my other intense conditioners better- I have a Redkin one and it works better (if I use a lot of product).</li>
    <li> Was okay; will not re-buy. I think it may have improved the blondeness of my hair; but am not really sure since it wasn&#x27;t significant. Did improve the strength of my hair though; definitely felt healthier afterwards.</li>
    <li> smells good, but didn&#x27;t feel the way i expected it to</li>
    <li> Great Conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and smooth and brings out the sparkle in my blonde highlights. I use it once or twice a week with a blue shampoo to combat brassiness.</li>
    <li> I always use this on my hair, defiantly an awesome treatment and repair for girls who bleach there hair, that ends up fried or dry</li>
    <li> This is great stuff and great price!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My salon gave me a sample to try and I loved it.  It made my hair feel great.  I would definitely purchase again.  I buy from Amazon because buying from my salon is too expensive.  This is a great treatment.</li>
    <li> Great deep mask.  My hair is bleached ombré and this is awesome. Way better than kerastase mask which was way more $$</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching safely for years and I can tell you that this product is at least 50% less damaging than any other bleach I&#x27;ve used. My hair is not breaking any more then it should naturally and it&#x27;s not left feeling dry or course after each bleaching. I&#x27;m very happy with the color as well.</li>
    <li> I love the container.  The product made my hair feel like baby hair. It definitely helped my bleached hair. Smells good and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really a blonde thing, but it&#x27;s certainily a good product for silky smooth hair. I use this when wearing my hair curly and straight and it works great both ways.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say, part of me feels like the actual conditioner in the container was not the same product, it smelled very different and just didn&#x27;t have to same effect.  So unless these were rejects, the manufacturer changed their formula or a bait and switch I would not buy again,  I&#x27;m hoping manufacturer just changed formula.  Let&#x27;s see when I buy from a local retailer.  I gave it 2 stars because it did condition.</li>
    <li> So far no complaints. I&#x27;ve been doing this routine once or twice a week -- but I also have no other product to compare it to. When I&#x27;m done, I may try a different product to see if there&#x27;s any difference, but my hair is definitely healthier.</li>
    <li> talk about great treatment... I have tried many expensive an non expensive but this stuff is miraculous! Really Must Try..</li>
    <li> This smells great and makes my hair so soft. I have been using it twice a week since I received it.</li>
