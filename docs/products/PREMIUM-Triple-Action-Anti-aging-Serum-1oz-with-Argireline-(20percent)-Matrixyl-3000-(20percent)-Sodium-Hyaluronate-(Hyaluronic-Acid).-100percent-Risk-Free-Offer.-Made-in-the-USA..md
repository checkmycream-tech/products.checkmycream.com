      <li>No irritation and my face feels smooth</li>

      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin but experienced no tingling at all with this serum.</li>
      <li>I rarely bother with sunscreen, because I don&#x27;t burn easily</li>
      <li>I love that this is pure and not oily at all.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They need to put the full ingredient deck up for this product.</li>
      <li>It arrived in good condition and I began using the product as directed, twice daily for what has been about two weeks now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After considering Botox and reading too many horror stories, I realize I&#x27;m too much of a coward to have needles stuck in my face.</li>
      <li>ACTUALLY IT IS QUITE GOOD.  </li>

      <li>It is also completely scent-free, a rarity in a market where most products carry some</li>
      <li>My skin is much more plump and soft to the touch than before.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasing consistency, a viscosity that is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
      <li>This is a very good product (though the claim that it&#x27;s a Botox alternative is ridiculous.)  </li>
      <li>I also love when they work their magic on dark spots, too.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs into the skins really quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>and I have few wrinkles, but I really do think this is a great product.</li>
      <li>I have found my new serum!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a marked difference in the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and mouth</li>
      <li>If there are no ill effects I will use it on my face.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many anti aging serums, and they all seem to be the same.  </li>
      <li>Who wants hormone mimicking chemical sunscreens in their skin serum?!  </li>
      <li>no results yet and probably is too soon in the first week</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>After all, I&#x27;m 61, and even though I possess warm, somewhat naturally tan skin thanks to my Mongol ancestors, a lifetime of living near the beach has taken</li>
      <li>It may be premature to make a judgement of its effectiveness on my wrinkles yet, but so far, I really have not seen any significant change.</li>
      <li>Most creams and serum have to dry forever b-4</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent with</li>
      <li>really like the dropper it comes with</li>
      <li>I REALLY</li>
      <li>, REALLY LIKE IT.  </li>
      <li>I waited a while to review this product because I really wanted to evaluate my skin after using it a while.  </li>
      <li>when I agreed to try Acetyl Organics ARGIRELINE Serum, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
      <li>I believe that my skin is brighter as well as tighter and just has a very refreshed look.  </li>
      <li>Recently received Argireline Anit-Aging Serum and goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>Have only used it for a few days but seems just as good as many of the same  high priced skin products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>As a lady of a certain age who spent too much time in the sun, stayed up too late for years, and  developed all accompanying vices;  this serum is great!  </li>
      <li>, it is very easy to measure out just a few drops with it.</li>
      <li>I am pleased at this time and will continue its use to see how much smoothing takes place of the slight wrinkling that I have.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect a facelift but do expect your skin to look fresh and radiant and feel smooth without feeling tight.</li>
      <li>I see a big difference in the fine lines near my eyes.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not gone, oh no, but they are less prominent, softer, than they were.</li>
      <li>The dark glass bottle will help prevent sunlight from reducing the effectiveness of the serum, so I feel pretty comfortable keeping this on my counter where I&#x27;ll remember to use it.</li>
      <li>Only need to use once daily if you are trying to maintain healthy looking skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> As I get up in years, I have realized how important a great skin care regimen is.  I have tried many anti aging serums, and they all seem to be the same.  But the Argireline Anti Aging Serum is the only one that has Argireline, so I was interested in seeing if there was a difference in those I have already tried and this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of its benefits are:&lt;br /&gt;- Erases the appearance of fine lines/crows feet around the eyes&lt;br /&gt;- Reduces the appearance of deep wrinkles in the forehead area&lt;br /&gt;- Reduces discoloration and uneven skin tone&lt;br /&gt;- Hydrates skin across all age groups&lt;br /&gt;- Improves skin tone and radiance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with the results, it immediately made my skin more radiant, it really was glowing.  I have found my new serum!!! I highly recommend this, even for young people, it is never too soon to take care of your skin!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
    <li> This serum is very thick and feels really silky going on.  It absorbs into the skins really quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ve noticed a marked difference in the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and mouth and I&#x27;ve been using it almost a month.  The bottle is a decent size and should last a while because it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face and neck area.  I also use this on the backs of my hands and I&#x27;ve noticed they don&#x27;t look as old as I thought they were beginning to look.  So that&#x27;s a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a reduced cost for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week, but the seller is asking me for a review...&lt;br /&gt;After considering Botox and reading too many horror stories, I realize I&#x27;m too much of a coward to have needles stuck in my face. So, Botox in a bottle? Well, as a serum, it seems fine. Nice consistency, great to have a glass dropper and bottle. Is it a miracle? Probably too soon to tell. It&#x27;s not blurring away my lines in an instant, but then I didn&#x27;t really expect that it would. It does seem to leave a slight heaviness/numb feeling on my forehead (where I&#x27;m hoping my lines will disappear). Serum or placebo?? Maybe if it keeps me from furrowing my brow, it&#x27;ll help soften those 11&#x27;s.  Again too soon to tell. Meanwhile, I can say that it&#x27;s caused me no irritation or breakouts, so I&#x27;m keeping with the program.</li>
    <li> This is the &amp;quot; year of the serum&amp;quot;.  I love that it is!  Serums...to me...are a more potent way to get really great ingredients into your skin.  I like serums to repair...foil and rejuvenate.  I also love when they work their magic on dark spots, too.  My husband and I use Vitamin C serums regularly and we have just begun using this one.  I believe that my skin is brighter as well as tighter and just has a very refreshed look.  I am never going to use Botox or get a face lift...but I will continue my use of anti aging potions, serums and lotions.  I like the feel of this one and I love what it does to my skin.  I have to add also that I like the price of this one.  I have been using one that is about ten times more expensive but the results I am getting are not all that different.  I love that this is pure and not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;My sincere thank you to the manufacturer for asking me to review this for my totally honest opinion!</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a day (AM/PM). My skin has noticeably improved - smoother, more radiant glow. Fine lines on my forehead are less noticeable, they seem to be smoothing out. People have notice a difference in my skin remarking how smooth my complexion looks, asking what I am doing/using to make my skin look this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•I like the idea of using a dropper to extract the product, it limits any waste and loss.&lt;br /&gt;When you apply the serum to your face it goes on smoothly/effortlessly, drying quickly leaving a non oily look/feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•Extremely concentrated so a little goes a long way, no wasted product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; •Easy to use, easy to apply. Non burning, quick drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•Can&#x27;t beat the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•Noticeable results, love the way my skin looks and feels</li>
    <li> Ordered my second bottle.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product (though the claim that it&#x27;s a Botox alternative is ridiculous.)  It&#x27;s basically hyaluronic acid, but unlike a lot of the watered-down swill that&#x27;s sold on Amazon, this one is super-thick and luscious.  It feels wonderful going on and my skin just drinks it up.  Unlike the watery ones, this plumps my skin up and makes it feel super hydrated all day.  Remember: this is a serum so it&#x27;s meant to be used under your regular moisturizer.  If you just use it alone your skin will feel thirsty again pretty quickly, but used before your moisturizer it magnifies the effects of your regular cream and allows you to use a lot less - saving you money.  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using hyaluronic acid for over a year and it has absolutely changed my skin... not overnight, but after using it for several months I realized that my skin was looking brighter and healthier.  Other people comment on it as well.  I&#x27;m never going back - I&#x27;ll be using hyaluronic acid until the day I die!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - Writing reviews has become an accidental hobby for me, and it always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.) Also, if you have any questions, clarifications, or comments please feel free to leave a comment below. I usually respond pretty quickly and almost always within 24 hours. This item was provided for review consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers! Claire</li>
    <li> This serum is fantastic!  This serum comes to you in a 30 ML amber glass bottle.  I have been applying this serum after cleansing my face.  It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent with is fantastic. I get headaches that are often triggered by different fragrances.  So, I always look for no fragrance or a light fragrance.  This serum goes on very easily and absorbs really quickly.  It does not leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell that this serum has helped really helped improve my fine lines.  I definitely recommend.  I was provided a free sample to test and review.</li>
    <li> I placed my order for Acetyl Organics&#x27; Argireline Botox Anti-Aging Serum on July 22, 2015 and received my shipment well in advance of the projected estimated delivery period. It arrived in good condition and I began using the product as directed, twice daily for what has been about two weeks now. The serum goes on well, is not the least bit oily, and penetrates the skin almost immediately. It may be premature to make a judgement of its effectiveness on my wrinkles yet, but so far, I really have not seen any significant change. I am a 56 year old female, already using Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid so was anxious to determine if the argireline would make any difference. My only complaint is that the eye dropper style bottle seems to leak easily and I lost some of the contents when it was placed on its side during air travel. I will continue to use the product in lieu of my previous regime because it does include all the ingredients I was previously using plus Vitamin A and the argireline that have been suggested to be included in an anti-aging treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week.  I&#x27;m using it morning and night.  So far I really like it.  My skin feels soft and smooth.  It seems as though my wrinkles on the forehead are already less noticeable. I love how it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky so that I can put my moisturizer and makeup on immediately after. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have already gone back and stocked up before the price goes up and before they get bought out.  I know the cosmetic industry, if you can&#x27;t compete buy them out and change the formula.  Hope they stay true and don&#x27;t fix what aint broke.  This is amazing stuff.  I have tried them all.  Not sticky, no white film no perfume actual no smell at all.  Use as directed takes just a few drops.  Dries quickly so if it you don&#x27;t get it spread fast enough put a dab water on your fingers and continue distributing.  I fell asleep with my makeup on (serum under)  Got an early visitor,  ran in the bathroom a little water wipe the black under my eyes and the magic worked even under my makeup.  Don&#x27;t recommend it for a routine but it does work.  Looking to see long term effect.  I live in desert conditions so my makeup will dry by the end of the day I just add a light moisturizer to the bb cream and the serum kicks in (under the bb cream).  I look like I just finished my makeup.  I even had someone ask me if I had work done.  At 67 that was a compliment. Don&#x27;t expect a facelift but do expect your skin to look fresh and radiant and feel smooth without feeling tight.</li>
    <li> My face feels smooth and silky.  People do not believe I am a great grandmother.</li>
    <li> no results yet and probably is too soon in the first week&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s wait for some more time</li>
    <li> Totally love it! I see a big difference in the fine lines near my eyes.</li>
    <li> Very powerful. Only need to use once daily if you are trying to maintain healthy looking skin.</li>
    <li> Wow I&#x27;ve only used it once as I had jst got it,&amp; I noticed the difference immediately!  I&#x27;m soo going to be using this product from now on,it does what it says &amp; I wld totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I cannot comment as I am returning this product.  Nowhere did I see the ingredients list and no other reviews mentioned that the &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; ingredients in this product are CHEMICAL SUNSCREENS!  Good grief!  Who wants hormone mimicking chemical sunscreens in their skin serum?!  No thanks!  I&#x27;m certain this product works, but I&#x27;m trying my best to avoid that type of stuff in my skincare. They need to put the full ingredient deck up for this product. Aaaaaaaarrrrrrgh!</li>
    <li> I waited a while to review this product because I really wanted to evaluate my skin after using it a while.  I can honestly say I see a difference in the firming of my skin around y mouth and eyes. The product goes on eaily and is abssorbed quickly. I am using it twice  day and plan to continue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this serum for a week but my complexion is brightened and smoother. Will continue to use this. Perhaps I&#x27;ll keep you all posted!</li>
    <li> It feels good but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results yet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of new topical skin serums. After all, I&#x27;m 61, and even though I possess warm, somewhat naturally tan skin thanks to my Mongol ancestors, a lifetime of living near the beach has taken it&#x27;s toll. Although I lack age spots, my skin is a little uneven with some redness, and I&#x27;ve got my share of wrinkles. I rarely bother with sunscreen, because I don&#x27;t burn easily and my family is at minimal risk for skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I agreed to try Acetyl Organics ARGIRELINE Serum, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I was wrong. The combination of Argireline and Hyaluronic acid, at maximum concentrations, is doing some very nice things for my skin. The Hyaluronic acid is doing a bang-up job of maximizing the moisture content in my face. My skin is much more plump and soft to the touch than before. The Argireline is magically easing wrinkles. They&#x27;re not gone, oh no, but they are less prominent, softer, than they were. Vitamin C is also acting to brighten and even out my skin, reducing redness. I have pretty sensitive skin but experienced no tingling at all with this serum. It is also completely scent-free, a rarity in a market where most products carry some scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the dropper it comes with, it is very easy to measure out just a few drops with it. The dark glass bottle will help prevent sunlight from reducing the effectiveness of the serum, so I feel pretty comfortable keeping this on my counter where I&#x27;ll remember to use it. If this works on my old, weathered skin, think what it can do for younger skin to help prevent damage. Give it a try, I think you&#x27;ll like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sample provided for review**</li>
    <li> As a lady of a certain age who spent too much time in the sun, stayed up too late for years, and  developed all accompanying vices;  this serum is great!  It&#x27;s not a facelift in a bottle, but it will make you look good.  It has a pleasing consistency, a viscosity that is quickly absorbed into the skin.  I can tell the mornings after I don&#x27;t use it; my wrinkles are more pronounced and my skin tone isn&#x27;t as healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, it&#x27;s not going to make you look thirty years younger, but with regular use, it will make people say, &amp;#34;Wow.  Did you just get back from vacation?&amp;#34;  And without surgery. what more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  I received my ARGIRELINE for review, but my opinion is mine.  As with all products, your results may vary.  Consistency, meaning regular use, is key.  Don&#x27;t use this once or twice and decide it&#x27;s not working.  Keep at it, and you&#x27;ll be rewarded.</li>
    <li> MADE IN CHINA...... If I had known this I would have passed this product by.  Quality control is horrendous in China.  I will test the product on a small spot inside my elbow for a few days before I apply to my face.  I just wanted everyone to know.  It is way too expensive to return and I don&#x27;t want to do that anyway.  If this is going to make me sick I definitely do not want it shippingbout to some other unsuspecting victim.  I am not saying that this product is contaminated in any way, yet.  All I am saying is that I do not trust anything manufactured in China for Shipment overseas.  How many babies and pets have been harmed or killed because of contaminated products?  The list is long.  I will test this product like I said.  If there are no ill effects I will use it on my face.  Hope all is well so I can use it.  UPDATE......THIS PRODUCT IS NOT HARMFUL IN ANY WAY.  ACTUALLY IT IS QUITE GOOD.  AFTER ONE DAY OF USE ON MY FACE MY SKIN IS SOFTER.  I  CHANGED MY RATING.  I REALLY, REALLY LIKE IT.  I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT.  THANK YOU ACETYL ORGANICS</li>
    <li> Recently received Argireline Anit-Aging Serum and goes on smooth.  Too short of a period of time to see any results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for only 10 days.  Even though it is too early to see any long term results, I do like the way it feels on my skin.  It is not sticky, nor does it have an odor, things that I find unpleasant in many other products.  So far it has made my skin soft and smooth with no dry patches....and this is without any other moisturizer.  I was curious to see if it would be drying.  I am pleased at this time and will continue its use to see how much smoothing takes place of the slight wrinkling that I have.</li>
    <li> Give it a try feels good on your skin</li>
    <li> I realized that I wasn&#x27;t stressing out about all of my forehead lines any more. They had faded almost entirely away! Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product and reasonably priced. Have only used it for a few days but seems just as good as many of the same  high priced skin products that I&#x27;ve tried. I have very sensitive skin and no problems thus far.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 3weeks and absolutely LOVE it!!  I can put bb cream on afterwards and goes on over this perfectly. Most creams and serum have to dry forever b-4 you can add any kind of foundation. Actually, after a few days all you need is a little blush and mascara. I&#x27; m 68 and foundation always ales you look older. Recently my husband has commented on how much younger I look than friends my age. Hope this never changes!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and I love it! I&#x27;ve been switching over my skin care to organic/green products gradually, so I&#x27;m really glad that I found this. This serum is a bargain compared to the others out there. I have combination sensitive skin with rosacea and this has not made me break out. It&#x27;s helped soften my glabellar wrinkles (vertical forehead lines) and I was seriously considering getting botox on the area. I&#x27;m not scared of needles, but at least I can put off the injectables a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my routine: I wash with a neutral face wash with SA, use witch hazel as a toner, and then use this serum. Occasionally I&#x27;ll use an eye cream depending on how puffy my eyes are. Lastly, I use my facial moisturizer with sunscreen and that&#x27;s it. At night, I follow the same routine, but use marula oil as my night moisturizer. This is my summer routine, I&#x27;ve yet to use this with colder weather, so we&#x27;ll see what modifications I&#x27;ll have to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a botox alternative. I&#x27;m only 37 and I have few wrinkles, but I really do think this is a great product. I will gladly repurchase!</li>
    <li> Just started using it.  No irritation and my face feels smooth</li>
    <li> Excellent, efficacious product...leaves skin soft, moisturized, and a TRULY noticeable difference in fine lines &amp; texture.  This company is also headed by a very approachable, responsive leadership who actually values the customer--rare today!  Can&#x27;t recommend this serum highly enough.</li>
