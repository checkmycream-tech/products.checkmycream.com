      <li>type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually purchased the Motiv wax when I had my longer hair, and it didn&#x27;t give me the best results.</li>
      <li>I repeat this until I am satisfied with the shape and hold.</li>

      <li>but honestly it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>It has one of the most intense holds of any hair wax product I&#x27;ve used, and yet it washes off super clean.</li>
      <li>I used to use a bunch of popular Japanese hair wax products, but it didn&#x27;t take much convincing after my first purchase to stick to this product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any strong evidence for this, but I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s helping the health of my hair.</li>
      <li>Does not take much wax to style because of its strong hold  4.</li>
      <li>She asked what kind of hair wax I use and told me I should consider using this regularly.</li>
      <li>It is really worth to pay.</li>
      <li>Easy to style and strong hold last for a day with no sticky hands.</li>
      <li>I own, and have tried, all the other Gatsby colors as well, and pink was the most suitable for my hair</li>
      <li>Cleaning your hand is easy (unlike many other products that still leave you with sticky fingers even after washing your hands with handsoap)    </li>
      <li>But after I cut my hair short, I found that it worked great on short hair!</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping and</li>
      <li>It keeps its hold in extreme conditions, and it doesn&#x27;t ever give you that gooey texture that most cheap products do.</li>
      <li>This is a really good wax that doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy or flake.</li>
      <li>so I felt a positive review was warranted.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Washes off easily and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry or sticky after.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different waxes and for my current hairstyle, this wax gives me a lot of flexibility to style my hair while not making it look like it has a lot of product in it.</li>
      <li>have fine, limp hair</li>
      <li>It holds very strong without giving you the stupid shinny on your hair like some cheap products.</li>

<li> It holds very strong without giving you the stupid shinny on your hair like some cheap products.</li>
<li> The wax is not of gooey texture, and it does not give a hard shiny look on your hair (like other cheap products)  5.</li>
<li> After years of having my hair long and in my eyes, I decided to cut it short into a faux-hawk type style.</li>
<li> It definitely has a stronger hold than the pink Gatsby, which Gatsby labels as one of their strongest.</li>
<li> wet, shiny, hardness look to my hair, but the pink Gatsby just didn&#x27;t hold well enough.</li>
<li> This wax is heavier, thicker, and harder to emulsify than the creamy Gatsby moving rubber waxes, so it just made my long hair look.... odd?</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used numerous products in the past: Axe hair waxes, Garnier Surf Style hair wax, Gatsby products, etc.</li>
<li> I was previously using the pink \\&quot;Spiky Edge\\&quot; Gatsby moving rubber to spike my hair up.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s annoying how many guys and gals flock over to get my number.</li>
<li> I loved Gatsby&#x27;s products because they didn&#x27;t produce a nasty 90s era</li>
<li> One of my previous hair stylists recommended this product to me after noticing that my hair was noticeably gunky even after having my hair washed.</li>
<li> To prevent a unnatural look, I take a little wax at a time, rub it between my palms for a few seconds, and apply it all over my hair.</li>
<li> Just small amount would do the job</li>
<li> No more trying and switching around!</li>
<li> I have really thin hair</li>
<li> that&#x27;s difficult to style without lots of product.</li>
<li> The San Diegan heat (and sun) doesn&#x27;t melt the wax - and leave a disgusting residue beneath my ears and on my forehead -</li>

    <li> I saw my hairdresser using this product so I bought it. It was a great choice!    PRO:  1. Great smell  2. Easy to style  3. Does not take much wax to style because of its strong hold  4. The wax is not of gooey texture, and it does not give a hard shiny look on your hair (like other cheap products)  5. Cleaning your hand is easy (unlike many other products that still leave you with sticky fingers even after washing your hands with handsoap)    CON:  - cost? but honestly it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> This is the best product!!!  No shine and great hold.  I have really thin hair and it always sticks up and out.  Motiv wax allows my hair to be styled and gain texture for my hair type without looking greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this hair wax! I got two of my roommates hooked on using this product too. Smells great, isn&#x27;t too shiny, and the hold is very strong.</li>
    <li> Just small amount would do the job</li>
    <li> This hair wax is amazing! After years of having my hair long and in my eyes, I decided to cut it short into a faux-hawk type style. I brought a smaller travel sized Motiv wax from my stylist and it has replaced my Gatsby moving rubber products as my regular go-to hair styling aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, limp hair that&#x27;s difficult to style without lots of product. I was previously using the pink \\&quot;Spiky Edge\\&quot; Gatsby moving rubber to spike my hair up. I loved Gatsby&#x27;s products because they didn&#x27;t produce a nasty 90s era wet, shiny, hardness look to my hair, but the pink Gatsby just didn&#x27;t hold well enough. I own, and have tried, all the other Gatsby colors as well, and pink was the most suitable for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually purchased the Motiv wax when I had my longer hair, and it didn&#x27;t give me the best results. This wax is heavier, thicker, and harder to emulsify than the creamy Gatsby moving rubber waxes, so it just made my long hair look.... odd? But after I cut my hair short, I found that it worked great on short hair! It definitely has a stronger hold than the pink Gatsby, which Gatsby labels as one of their strongest. To prevent a unnatural look, I take a little wax at a time, rub it between my palms for a few seconds, and apply it all over my hair. I repeat this until I am satisfied with the shape and hold. Best of all, it smells good and is made in Korea! If you want to look like a K-Pop celeb, then I recommend this wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Good for Asian hair; good for producing a natural, matte look; good for short/long spiked up faux-hawk style hair.</li>
    <li> Strong hold and not shiny. It is form-cream like so easy to apply.</li>
    <li> My jobs as a night-time club promoter and part-time model require that my hair can hold its position and withstand a variety of weather conditions and temperatures. In essence, \\&quot;looking good\\&quot; is a critical component of my livelihood. I&#x27;ve used numerous products in the past: Axe hair waxes, Garnier Surf Style hair wax, Gatsby products, etc. However, nothing that I have used compares to the sheer brilliance of this product. It keeps its hold in extreme conditions, and it doesn&#x27;t ever give you that gooey texture that most cheap products do. The San Diegan heat (and sun) doesn&#x27;t melt the wax - and leave a disgusting residue beneath my ears and on my forehead - and although it&#x27;s pricey, if attractive hair is an important personal arsenal, I highly recommend investing in this great product.</li>
    <li> smells good, holds up hair really nicely all day long.strongly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and the hair wax is great. It holds very strong without giving you the stupid shinny on your hair like some cheap products. Try it, you will definitely love it. I bought 3 at the same time just in case they stop produce it anymore lol</li>
    <li> This is the only hair wax that I use for years. Great product! Great quality! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Best Wax Ever. No question about it...</li>
    <li> Good quality  wax for Good price~~&lt;br /&gt;No wonder why people&#x27;s  gave them five stars ~~!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Strong hold and don&#x27;t need to apply a lot. I love that it&#x27;s a matte finish so your hair doesn&#x27;t look shiny. Only downside is that I look TOO attractive and it&#x27;s annoying how many guys and gals flock over to get my number.</li>
    <li> This was the hair wax my stylist used ever time after my haircut. I liked it so much that I had to get it from her. Now that I no longer go to that salon, I&#x27;m glad I can find it here! It&#x27;s the best wax (more like a putty) to get if you want control but yet a non sticky feeling. Holds great and smiles good also. Washes off easily and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry or sticky after. And a container seem to last me a good while!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, and he loves it! It smells great and does what he wants. His search for perfect wax seems to be done with this one. He&#x27;ll stick with this one! No more trying and switching around!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using this product for some time now so I felt a positive review was warranted. One of my previous hair stylists recommended this product to me after noticing that my hair was noticeably gunky even after having my hair washed. She asked what kind of hair wax I use and told me I should consider using this regularly. I used to use a bunch of popular Japanese hair wax products, but it didn&#x27;t take much convincing after my first purchase to stick to this product. It has one of the most intense holds of any hair wax product I&#x27;ve used, and yet it washes off super clean. I don&#x27;t have any strong evidence for this, but I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s helping the health of my hair.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair product out there. My hair dresser use this product and just got them from amazon. Love it Love it and Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a really good wax that doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy or flake. I have tried many different waxes and for my current hairstyle, this wax gives me a lot of flexibility to style my hair while not making it look like it has a lot of product in it. The delivery was prompt and arrived as scheduled</li>
    <li> It is the excellent wax I have ever used!!  Easy to style and strong hold last for a day with no sticky hands. It is really worth to pay.</li>
