      <li>and I do notice that my skin tone is much more even and brighter.</li>
      <li>Smells lovely</li>
      <li>Glad I found this on my quest to find organic body products that I like.</li>
      <li>However, it is a bit more runny than that.  </li>
      <li>so the product was thicker, therefore more concentrated.</li>
      <li>I am sure this product works for some people but not for me.</li>
      <li>so I need more out of most products.</li>
      <li>For the price, I was expecting something more beneficial.</li>
      <li>It has a nice lavendar scent and leaves my face so smooth.  </li>
      <li>The cleanser is nice and it makes my face feel clean, but so does Dove soap and water.</li>
      <li>Great for very sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>So good, feels light and super clean!</li>
      <li>No burning, smells very nice with the lavender and most importantly its gentle and my skin always feels nice and fresh after a wash.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, not sure it is good for acne prone skin, but it is good to have and leaves your face feeling amazingly smooth.</li>
      <li>It works great and has no harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural, so that alone makes it great, but what it does for my combination skin is miraculous.  </li>
      <li>It not only feels great to use, but knowing that it is safe to use is even better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells, you know its all natural and good for your skin.</li>

      <li>Smells good and has (what feels like) microscopic scrubbing material that leaves your face soft, exfoliated and clean!</li>
      <li>If I use a mask twice a week it will be fine though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, so when I found this and saw how good it worked, I was overjoyed.  </li>
      <li>I do enjoy many of 100% pure&#x27;s products, I wish I could love this one.</li>
      <li>I do see a change in my skin it does control the oil and leaves my face looking fresh and healthy.</li>
      <li>(and I dislike scents), lightly foaming, and manages to wash off all my make up and eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>Absolute best facial cleanser I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Since a lot of things we apply to our skin actually causes more harm then good.</li>
      <li>It cleans nice enough but not too well honestly.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more products from this line!!</li>
      <li>Price has gone way up since I first tried it, but I keep coming back for more anyway because it really is the best!</li>
      <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me as I don&#x27;t find it very strong, and I&#x27;d much rather this smell than the smell of chemicals/alcohol-based products.</li>
      <li>I do think it would be a wonderful cleanser for people that do not have acne or maybe have a couple small pimples a month</li>
      <li>My skin is also glowing like I have a golden tan without laying out in the sun!</li>
      <li>I love this face wash so much!</li>
      <li>My face doesn&#x27;t feel clean after I use it which defeats the purpose of using it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been a little excessive with the organic things lately and once I saw this I had to get it. I have very sensitive skin so using natural products really appealed to me. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and it&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve been bouncing between facial cleansers and think I have found my new favorite</li>
    <li> I wanted to use natural products and found this while comparing other products. The product is green in color and has a good smell. It does not lather much, so it does not remove makeup. It also has some scrubbing agent and you feel them when washing your face but it is not granny or harsh. Very good product and leaves face really smooth.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Lavender &amp; decided to try this cleanser. It is not as moisturising as I would like however I find it makes a good quick masque then I use a lighter oil cleanser afterward ;-)</li>
    <li> I want to start of by saying that it is a good product. It leaves your face clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason i am actually giving it four stars is because the tube I got was more than halfway empty already. I might have just gotten a bad one, but either way it was very disappointing. Needless to say if I were to buy it again I would rather go to a store just so I can make sure there&#x27;s enough product.</li>
    <li> LOVE everything about this cleanser!  My face feels smooth and clean, and my pores appear smaller after I use it! It has become my new favorite facial cleanser... highly recommend!</li>
    <li> For a while I have been interested into switching to a more natural skincare routine.Since a lot of things we apply to our skin actually causes more harm then good.So I found 100%pure on amazon and decided to give it a try.For the record I have combination skin.I was surprised at how little you needed to create a really nice rich gentle lather that made my skin feel balanced. It did not feel tight or itchy nor did it give me red blotches or burn in any way as sum widely found cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.The color is a murky green and the scent has a bit of an earthy quality to it with a little lavender, nothing too overpowering.Though that might not be to everyone&#x27;s liking.I am really enjoying this product and will certainty be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I have tried skin care products from A - Z.  Recently, I had a terrible allergic reaction to an expired facial cleanser (and my skin started peeling like a snake) and getting really red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product after two agonizing days of embarassment.  The color of the cleanser is not too attractive (medium green kelp color) but it foams up into a luxurious lather.  One pea size dot does the whole face and it smells wonderful.  I followed up with the PomPeptide Moisturizer, and my allergies were gone after one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just look at the ingredients!  You can&#x27;t beat it.  :)  Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year. It has evened out my skin tone and I love the way it smells and leaves my skin feeling clean and not dried out. I do use it with the facial brush which lathers the cleanser nicely.</li>
    <li> great product .. all natural and my skin Loves it! .. speedy delivery .. will order again For sure :)</li>
    <li> I love 100% pure products but never tried this one.  It leaves the skin super clean without any harsh ingredients.  It does leave my skin a bit dry, but I use coconut oil right after I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is very hard to find facial cleanser that are 100% pure and that can clean, this one really does clean and what&#x27;s even beter, it is all natural.</li>
    <li> I am sure this product works for some people but not for me. I like the smell and texture however after using this product for about a week my face looked real bad because it dried out my skin, around my eyes especially also the side of my face was breaking out in a rash. I have pretty much normal skin, maybe this works well for people with oiley skin. I do enjoy many of 100% pure&#x27;s products, I wish I could love this one.</li>
    <li> At first I really liked this product. It made my skin glow and took care of excess oil. I was using it as a mask, not a cleanser. But then I made the mistake of using it too often and that actually caused me to break out. Not exactly the product&#x27;s fault, I just have incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have semi sensitive skin and I was reluctant to change my face cleaning regimen but I knew I wanted to take a more natural approach to all of my cleaning and moisturizing routines.  After doing extensive research and biting the bullet and paying this price point, I decided to give the PURE product line a try.  I have been pleasantly surprised with the results.  This product is green and does not have a bad smell.  It cleans my face well without drying me out and I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for shipping this item quickly.  This is a good product, not sure it is good for acne prone skin, but it is good to have and leaves your face feeling amazingly smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Only need a little and it leaves my face feeling so clean. I have normal skin (not too dry or oily) but it can be sensitive to harsh products. This is very gentle not drying out my skin or leaving residue. My husband has oily skin and deals with blemishes and this has cleared up and balanced out his skin better than all those products geared towards treating blemishes. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling, but average on cleanliness. I still get dry skin, so its not too easy on the skin</li>
    <li> My skin feels a lot cleaner after using this cleanser as opposed to using something that foams like traditional soap.</li>
    <li> I really do like this cleanser, especially because it&#x27;s natural but it is a little bit drying. Just the tiniest bit though. So far I&#x27;ve used it three times and I do notice that my skin tone is much more even and brighter. It&#x27;s also helped to calm my skin down and helps with redness. It looks like my pores are a tad smaller too which is a first, I&#x27;ve tried plenty of face washes and none of them really made a difference in pore size. I know this product doesn&#x27;t claim to make a difference in that area but I think it has in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that as I said it&#x27;s a tiny bit drying and it doesn&#x27;t deep clean. It cleans nice enough but not too well honestly. I have acne prone skin and blackheads though so I need more out of most products. If I use a mask twice a week it will be fine though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s the only item I&#x27;ve tried of 100% pure so far but I definitely want the whole line after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve used this product for around a couple of months now and I do not like it. I think I was a bit overly excited first trying it out because I had wanted to try this product line for so long &amp; I really wanted to like it. I do have blackheads and large pores, and light to moderate acne. This cleanser does not clean out my pores at all. My face doesn&#x27;t feel clean after I use it which defeats the purpose of using it. I do think it would be a wonderful cleanser for people that do not have acne or maybe have a couple small pimples a month but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for oily skin or acne prone skin. Only issue is it doesn&#x27;t clean well enough.</li>
    <li> So good, feels light and super clean! Nothing quite like it, especially in the natural, organic department. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Eucalyptus Cleanser for a little over a year now (purchased it twice). I have yet to use the Lavender version, but I&#x27;m more prone to oily-skin, especially in a hot, humid climate like Florida.... but now that I live in Seattle, I might give the Lavender a try once we get closer to winter. For the value, I&#x27;ve gotten this cleanser cheaper than 20$, but that is not to say that it isn&#x27;t worth shelling out 20$ if you can spare it. Especially if you like to support small businesses who cater to the organic/natural culture. For those who have done their homework, it is extremely tough to find a cleanser that your skin will agree with and I think I&#x27;m sticking with this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the eucalyptus cleanser has really toned down the oiliness of my skin. I tend to use it the most in the shower every other day, either as a mask and/or I exfoliate with it. I really like the feeling it has on my skin and is probably the best reason why I switched to all natural/organic skincare products. The chemicals in other products really burned my skin, but this gives my skin a more &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect, making it feel super clean when I rinse it off. At night, I like to rinse off my makeup with 100% Pure White Tea Cleanser, and it is even gentle enough to where I can use the White Tea cleanser after I just used the Seafoam cleanser as a mask. No itchiness, no redness - nothing. It not only feels great to use, but knowing that it is safe to use is even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The after effects are wonderful, my skin looks clearer and maybe even a little more matte, which is great for putting on makeup after your shower. Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d do without this cleanser. It is strong enough to prevent my adult acne breakouts (especially during that time of the month) while still being very gentle. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me as I don&#x27;t find it very strong, and I&#x27;d much rather this smell than the smell of chemicals/alcohol-based products. Also, I can&#x27;t say for sure why those other people are having problems with the cleanser, but I would at least try giving the opposite cleanser a shot. Most people are unaware of what type of skin they have, and they might even be allergic to some of the natural ingredients in these products.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Be careful though- it&#x27;s not an everyday product. If you use everyday, it might dry out your skin (of course, depending on your skin type). You only need a little bit. Put a little in you hand and rub together to make a nice type of foam. This will make it last. Cleans well. For an everyday face wash, I use Dr. Ron&#x27;s (all natural, smells good, works well).</li>
    <li> !00% pure Seafoam facial cleanser makes your skin very clean. It removes all my makeup and gunk from a typical, stressful day. No breakouts, but a bit drying. I&#x27;ll use this only twice a week. It is a good summer cleanser though.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash so much! It works great and has no harsh chemicals. Now my mom uses it, too. I have continued to buy it and will continue to. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and recently I was having a lot of redness and burning/itching/tingling after having good luck with my skin for several years, so I switched up my skin routine. Now I cleanse with 100% Pure Organic Lavender Seafoam Facial Cleanser, when I get out of the shower I spray with 100% Pure Organic Rose Hydrosol Tonique, then combine two drops of rose-hip seed oil with 100% Pure Organic Acai Berry Antioxidant Facial Cream and smear that all over my moist face, neck, and chest. My skin has calmed right back down again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser smells like lavender and looks like a watery green mud mask. I get very different results with this depending on whether I use it in or out of the shower. Used in the shower with my pores open and all the moisture to keep it from drying out is the best for me. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and less dry then when I began. That is saying a lot because my skin is EXTREMELY dry. This also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin even though it&#x27;s super sensitive. I have a very hard time finding cleansers that don&#x27;t leave me itchy and blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use this one time as a mask while not in the shower. It was drying up before I could spread it around and it did leave my skin dryer that time. I think it was because my skin wasn&#x27;t as wet so the product was thicker, therefore more concentrated. I do love it as a mask in the shower. I will repurchase this.</li>
    <li> Natural facial cleanser that has a clay-mask texture.  The cleanser works well with either a washcloth or a Clarisonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the product is thick and has more of a clay mask feel instead of a clear liquid / gel consistency.  Does a good job cleansing the face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and so far I love it. I do see a change in my skin it does control the oil and leaves my face looking fresh and healthy. My only complain is that there is not much product in the container I feel like it will run out very fast.</li>
    <li> Tried this face cleanser as I needed to eliminate chemicals to get rid of perioral dematitis.  This face wash is fantastic - smells great (and I dislike scents), lightly foaming, and manages to wash off all my make up and eye makeup.  Did not make my face break out. Am a convert.  Would like to see a face lotion with a similiar scent from them</li>
    <li> I really do not care for this.  It’s like a clay masque – visually -  and pretty much the way it goes on .  However, it is a bit more runny than that.  It doesn’t really clean my face; I always have a lot of makeup that still comes off onto my cotton pad when I use a toner.  I find the toner and this cleanser combined is a bit too drying but the cleanser simply doesn’t clean.  I also find it really messy and it covers my sink when I wash it off.  I guess I’m just pretty disappointed in this cleanser all the way around.  I prefer some of my drugstore cleansers over this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a long search for vegan facial products that work well with my sensitive skin and this is it. No burning, smells very nice with the lavender and most importantly its gentle and my skin always feels nice and fresh after a wash. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the smell and the way it leaves my face feeling clean and less irritated.  I would purchase this again.  I work in a kitchen and it&#x27;s important to me to keep my face from getting oily, this washes away all the oil without being harsh and calms any irritation.</li>
    <li> what a great cleanser! feels very luxurious and spa-like. i always use at night time. gentle, yet gets rid of all impurities and shine</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Leaves my skin feeling clean and smelling great. Worth the price</li>
    <li> For the price, I was expecting something more beneficial. The cleanser is nice and it makes my face feel clean, but so does Dove soap and water. A little of this cleanser goes a long way. For that reason, it should last quite a while. I have been using it for a few months now and I have not noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product !! I have very sensitive skin and this product is perfect!! I like how it&#x27;it&#x27;s like a mask texture! ! My face feels so clean and refreshed!! Highly recommended! ! Will definitely buy more products from this line!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> It stings and I felt pain once it was massage on my face with water. I believe I&#x27;m allergic to lavender because it contains this ingredient - Linalool</li>
    <li> This is excellent. Removes dirt, blackheads, whiteheads, reduces pores. But you have to use it correctly. I take a small amount (dime size) and rub it all over my face in a gentle circular motion a little area at a time until all of it absorbed on my face. There should be not be any cleanser left on the face after rubbing it. Once its all dry, rinse and use  your daily cleanser. The reason I say to use your daily cleanser is because when I used this by itself, I was mildly breaking out. This cleanser will leave your face super clean and will brighten up your complexion. My sister used it and ended buying it here herself.</li>
    <li> its vegan and it cleans my skin what is not to love about that</li>
    <li> My new fa vorite face wash! Was gaving some problems with forehead bumps used this with Arcona face pads and they are gone!</li>
    <li> The 100% pure products have been very good for my skin. This cleanser is very good and cleans deep down in your skin. I got this cleanser because I got the 100% pure seaweed mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also when you buy this make sure you have a good face lotion if its winter.</li>
    <li> All 100% Pure products are awesome. Just don&#x27;t get this one in your eyes! Fabulous cleanser!</li>
    <li> i love this stuff, i use it in the shower with my clairsonic mia and it does a great job cleaning my face. its a thick green &#x27;mud&#x27; looking product, but rinses off well and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.not a very strong lavender scent to it.</li>
    <li> This is such a gentle and good cleanser. It feels great to use a product that is not filled with chemicals, that leaves skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I have very sensitive skin, so when I found this and saw how good it worked, I was overjoyed.  It does not foam a lot or take very much to clean your entire face.  I use it on my neck as well.  It has a nice lavendar scent and leaves my face so smooth.  Since using this product, I no longer have breakouts.  I would get bad acne along my jawline every month, and this product has completely eliminated that.  Wonderful bonus:  it is completely vegan and cruelty-free!  I will purchase again and again, no matter the price!</li>
    <li> Absolute best facial cleanser I have ever used. It&#x27;s a spa treatment in a bottle. Price has gone way up since I first tried it, but I keep coming back for more anyway because it really is the best!</li>
    <li> There were so many positive reviews, that I decided to purchase this facial cleanser. I do not like it at all. It is way too harsh for my skin, which is normal to oily (T-Zone). The first night I used it as a quick mask, as suggested. I applied a thin layer, and left it on while brushing my teeth... two minutes Tops. I rinsed it off quite thoroughly. My face had tiny red bumps all over it, and felt as dry as can be. I waited two days, to give my face time to recover. I&#x27;ve used it two more evenings, as a facial wash only, rinsing it off quite thoroughly in the shower. I find it to be Very drying! My face feels tight, dried out and irritated. My cheeks are red, even an hour later, with splotches. I have not been able to use my serum afterward, as it stings like crazy. I was able to use some rose water to calm down my facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use clay masks that I leave on for 20 min. with good results. I&#x27;ve used scrubs as well, and they do not bother my skin. I would Not say I have sensitive skin, at all. I&#x27;m not sure how people got such different results!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the right product for me at all.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and was using Neutrogena anti-wrinkle/anti-acne face wash and my skin just kept breaking out. Regardless of what I did nothing would calm the acne down. I purchased this Lavender Seafoam face wash and started using it with my Clarasonic MIA and within a week my skin was soft, smooth and my acne had dramatically decreased! I love the way it smells, you know its all natural and good for your skin. My skin is also glowing like I have a golden tan without laying out in the sun! I highly recommend this product and will continue to purchase it over and over again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite! I love it. After my first tube I tried the one for oily skin, and found it a bit too harsh for my skin. I really don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; skin. I have &amp;#34;normal/combination&amp;#34; skin so this one works great. Smells amazing too. I wash my face with this and a touch of raw organic honey with my clarisonic brush everyday, and my skin has never been clearer. Try it! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it&#x27;s all natural AND vegan. What more could you ask for? A little goes a long way too!</li>
    <li> I love the subtle scent of lavender in this face wash and the way it foams. Definitely does not seem to dry out my skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells good and has (what feels like) microscopic scrubbing material that leaves your face soft, exfoliated and clean! A small dollop is enough to wash your entire face so this little bugger will last you quite some time.</li>
    <li> Sounds good, clean. Very well I feel. I used to seaweed cleaner as well, this is little too pricy though.</li>
    <li> Just okay.  Was a little drying for me.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and I always look forward to using it. Great ingredients from 100% Pure as always.</li>
    <li> I was turned off at first when I saw the seaweed green color of the face wash, but after using it a few times, I am a fan. I love most everytying that this company makes, and would recommend to anyone wanting to get away from the harsh cheimcals in so many beauty products these days.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this facial cleanser.  It&#x27;s all natural, so that alone makes it great, but what it does for my combination skin is miraculous.  The combination of ingredients is wonderful--seaweed, lavender, french clay, vitamins C and E, various herbal extracts, cocoanut oil...it foams up and smells great.  I think the key is that the clay is cleansing (like you won&#x27;t believe how cleansing, pores shrink, blackheads disappear), but it doesn&#x27;t strip your skin and make it too dry.  It&#x27;s one of the best facial cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used, and a little goes a long way.  You only need a little dollop, more is a waste as it does the job with less.  Totally worth every dime; I don&#x27;t agree with others that it&#x27;s over-priced.  I get annoyed when people think something is too expensive when a) it actually works like it says it does, and b) they don&#x27;t consider the cost of all-natural ingredients and what it takes to put them into a product like this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok product... I like clean feeling after but it not so gentle around eyes area. An it make my skin a little dry. Maybe for some people who have oily skin would be perfect.</li>
    <li> awesome product, I keep coming back and re-buying it when I&#x27;m done with the bottle.. don&#x27;t ever want to buy another cleanser.. it is cleansing and moisturizes and does not leave your face tight feeling</li>
    <li> I love how safe this is for you. The ingredients are rated safe on the ewg website.  I have very oily skin and it&#x27;s so gentle I tend to be oily by afternoon. It has a bit of a clean mud smell.</li>
    <li> Great product that leaves my oily skin clean and breakout-free. Also love how it is natural, vegan, without any weird chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love this! It works great for me and makes my face feel awesome after using it. It&#x27;s not drying or irritating. Glad I found this on my quest to find organic body products that I like.</li>
    <li> Note:  It says \\&quot;nourshing for all skin types but especially for dry, sensitive skin\\&quot;.  Product received looks like the picture except it says \\&quot;for oily, sensitive skin\\&quot;.  Instruction says may leave on like a mud mask.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleaner. It smells nice and leave my skin fresh, clean and glowing. I love the fact that it is an organic product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. You just feel healthy using it. It was strange at first cause it is a little like mud but, great health benefits.</li>
    <li> Great for very sensitive skin! Has all natural ingredients that aid and heal the skin. No artificial lather agents, or chemicals for color, it&#x27;s green goop, but that assures you it&#x27;s natural! And hey, it has seaweed in it! That&#x27;s what makes it green!</li>
