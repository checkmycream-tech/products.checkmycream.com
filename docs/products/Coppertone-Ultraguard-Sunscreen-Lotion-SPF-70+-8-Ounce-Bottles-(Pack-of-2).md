      <li>I chose this one for it&#x27;s SPF and broad spectrum coverage.</li>
      <li>This was brought home to me in no certain way when the deep tan lines I had on my arms and legs more or less disappeared within weeks.</li>

    <li> After ignoring the advice to use SunBlock for many years and suffering scaly skin after 2-3 long bike rides in sunny California, I finally caved in after trying this Sunblock from a fellow cyclist. All my previous objections to various brands of Sunblock seem to have been addressed with this. It is not too greasy (at least you do not feel it after putting it on), it has no overpowering nasty perfume and it does an excellent job of protecting your skin.

    <li> I bought this sunscreen after carefully reviewing many sunscreens on the market. I chose this one for it&#x27;s SPF and broad spectrum coverage. I believe this sunscreen is old and expired as it didn&#x27;t work at all. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this product from this seller.</li>
    <li> I bought Coppertone Ultraguard Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 70+, 8-Ounce Bottle from a local store. I was in a hurry since we were heading out for a day with the kids.  My daughter is very fair and gets over heated and sun burnt fast.     In the past I have used the Copper tone Water babies on her, but this blows that out of the water. I applied this to her prior to going in the sun. I usually put it on her entire body before she gets dressed, then I reapply as needed after swimming or a lot of sweating.  Well this stuff is like super water proof, and last a long time.     We were at the amusement park (in the water rides and wave pools) all day and she not only had a great time she did not complain about having to put more sun block on.    My entire family used it so I have bought it from Amazon.com in the 2 pack for our trip to Florida. I expect it to work just as well. Will update when we return.</li>
    <li> We love this product becuase it is non greasy and great for everyday use. Very hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product after removing a growth from my nose that was pre-cancerous.  He said it is very important to always use a good sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I ordered several bottles before a pre-wedding trip to San Carlos, Mexico.  I&#x27;m very pale, and burn easily.  My fiancee&#x27;s biggest worry is that I&#x27;d end up looking like a tomato for our wedding pictures after being burned in the brutal Mexican sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use coppertone sport because the waterproofness of it is decent.  I usually use an SPF 30 that allows a little sun but not enough to burn when used regularly.  If used correctly, coppertone Sport does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, this is better.  waterproof seem to last a little longer, application was easy and not greasy.  It protected me for a week in the sun and trust the quality and performance of this product.</li>
    <li> Product only available in USA, in EU Coppertone don&#x27;t sell lotions over 50+. Not greasy at all, fast absorption and strong long lasting protection: no red skin!</li>
    <li> Not greasy, and good protection.  Come form Aus so I know my sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Pretty well priced. More quantity than the supposedly \\&quot;100+\\&quot;.. THe ratings are marketing lingo... So as long as u liberally apply lots of sunscreen with reasonable SPF u are good...     One con - not sure if its the same with other sunscreens... I played tennis after applying this and the sweat burns the eye a little bit....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of Irish descent living in San Diego, and I will have a sunburn after only 30 minutes unprotected in the sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros -&lt;br /&gt;- IT WORKS!!!  Only if you specifically FOLLOW DIRECTIONS on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;- It leaves a nice, thick, coated (protected!) feeling on your skin.  Not a thin greasy/slick layer that feels like it comes off as soon as you hit the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons -&lt;br /&gt;- Will likely stain most clothing (it left un-removable yellow stains on my white rash guard)&lt;br /&gt;- Burns my eyes just a tad, but not nearly as bad as other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> everything was ok, quality and price good.</li>
    <li> Spent a month in Key West and came home almost as pale as when I left, which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re good about putting this stuff on every 2 hours or so you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I am as white as they come and this got me through a sunburn free vacation to Kauai.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, along with the same product in SPF 50 and it destroyed my white fabric turning it brown.  Three completely different fabrics.  I will never use this product again.  Cost me $500 in ruined clothing.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended me some years ago to use every day, when I am exposed to the sun, a sunscreen lotion for my face and parts of may body that will be exposed to thw sun. I decided to use a Coppertone product that was not greasy, that had a protection of 45. However, since 2 years ago, I am using this, that will give me more protection.</li>
    <li> Light lotion, easy to apply and spread, not greasy , absorbs very fast without the sticky sensation. Excellent for white and sensitive skin.</li>
