      <li>The perfect addition to carry with you when you&#x27;re taking a long trip and staying fresh to def is a must!</li>

      <li>to the product, these have and continue to give me the fresh out of the barber chair look without the just sat in the barber chair price!</li>
      <li>no difference from the original that came with the clippers......</li>
      <li>If not number one on a Barber&#x27;s list they are certainly in the top three.</li>
      <li>My Andis trimmer was starting to nick me and pull on hairs instead of getting a good clean cut.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;M GETTING A SUPER CLOSE SHAVE...</li>
      <li>It was quicker and more convenient to order a new blade.</li>
      <li>I purchased these a while back for my Andis trimmer which I really liked.  </li>
      <li>but it was worth the weight</li>
      <li>My husband dropped his trimmer at just the right angle to break the corner of the trimmer blade, and thus we needed a replacement.</li>
      <li>Right out of the package</li>
      <li>Thesee blades are very sharp and of good quality.  </li>
      <li>it shipped in a reasonable time, We originally considered having out old one sharpened,  </li>

      <li>Ended up buying a new Wahl Lithium-Ion cordless trimmer at Walmart.  </li>
      <li>the blades did not seem to cut like new.  </li>
      <li>Works pretty good , very sharp came kinda slow</li>
      <li>It seems to help it stay sharp and clean.</li>
      <li>They feel so smooth , when you cut it doesnt even feel like its cutting or touching your head.</li>
      <li>Now there are clippers that no matter how many adjustments that are made, they refuse to be sharp much less super sharp.</li>
      <li>Blade not sharp at all.</li>
      <li>I had to use some of the old parts to make this blade seat properly</li>
      <li>Anyway for those who expect ANY trimmers to be SUPER SHARP without making some adjustments to them is about as naive as the new owner of The Brooklyn Bridge.</li>
      <li>i really have nothing bad to say , I love these linner blades.</li>

<li> Will buy again when these dull or break.</li>
<li> no longer do they have to deal with dull blade.</li>
<li> &amp; so I am back to cutting just after 3 days.</li>
<li> The blade was very dull.</li>
<li> my hair at times instead of cutting it.  </li>
<li> So I figured it might had been a bad set.  </li>
<li> Needless to say, I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
<li> …exact, official OEM, desperately needed and arrived just in time!</li>

    <li> Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> it shipped in a reasonable time, We originally considered having out old one sharpened,  It was quicker and more convenient to order a new blade.</li>
    <li> great deal works fine received in good time quickly changed out husband and son so happy no longer do they have to deal with dull blade.</li>
    <li> Right blade, fast shipping, great price!</li>
    <li> I purchased these a while back for my Andis trimmer which I really liked.  Right out of the package the blades did not seem to cut like new.  It would still \\&quot;grab\\&quot; my hair at times instead of cutting it.  I bought 3 sets.  So I figured it might had been a bad set.  I opened up a second set and got the same results.  I contacted the seller and he replied promptly.  He asked what I wanted to do.  Well, I knew I would have to pay for shipping and decided not to do anything about it. I just won&#x27;t purchase these anymore.</li>
    <li> Thesee blades are very sharp and of good quality.  I had to make a few adjustments to take off the blade guard but it came off I took blade off trimmers and put these on and it&#x27;s been working like a charm.  Will be buying more for this price. I went to Sallys and they selling them for $20more.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good blade, and a pretty good clipper. We ended up buying another brand and it worked better for us.</li>
    <li> Love my clippers clean cut</li>
    <li> Always a plus in helping to keep me and my clients linings fresh!! i cut my hair daily and if you take care of your clippers they will take care of you!!!</li>
    <li> Of all the blades I&#x27;ve purchased over the last 20+ years, these have been the only ones that did not perform as expected out of the package. Needless to say, I was very disappointed in this product. Even after zero-gapping them, they still did not cut....at all...</li>
    <li> This is a factory blade that works as it is suppose to. It may require adjustment according to your needs. Good quality.</li>
    <li> THIS BLADE DOES THE JOB, NICE AND FAST...  IT WAS AN EASY REPLACEMENT...  AND THANKS TO SOME ADJUSTMENT TIPS, FROM YOUTUBE VIDEOS, I&#x27;M GETTING A SUPER CLOSE SHAVE...</li>
    <li> …exact, official OEM, desperately needed and arrived just in time! about to order another one, just in case.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality...  just don&#x27;t drop them...  shipped on time and easy to install.  This is the second time I have needed to buy this...</li>
    <li> Kids + Clippers on the bathroom counter &#x3D; the reason why I had to purchase a blade replacement... Sigh* It was my own fault. Anyway for those who expect ANY trimmers to be SUPER SHARP without making some adjustments to them is about as naive as the new owner of The Brooklyn Bridge. Now there are clippers that no matter how many adjustments that are made, they refuse to be sharp much less super sharp. Those clippers have a home in the trash where they belong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the product, these have and continue to give me the fresh out of the barber chair look without the just sat in the barber chair price! The perfect addition to carry with you when you&#x27;re taking a long trip and staying fresh to def is a must!</li>
    <li> My husband dropped his trimmer at just the right angle to break the corner of the trimmer blade, and thus we needed a replacement. We found Andis Blade Set Pivot Pro Trimmer blades on Amazon for a great price, which is exactly what we were looking for and needed. This product is exactly as described and worked beautifully. We have had no problems installing or using this product to my husband&#x27;s trimmer. We have no negatives or cons to report on this product. If you need replacement Andis Pivot Pro Trimmer Blades, than here you go. This is the product you need!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  No surprises here...just the way I like it.</li>
    <li> Very good replacement blade......no difference from the original that came with the clippers......will highly recommend.........gives a clean cut and close shave!</li>
    <li> The replacement blades grabbed my hair and left my haircut with grooves and an overall uneven cut.  The original blades that we were trying to replace performed much better than these.  Ended up buying a new Wahl Lithium-Ion cordless trimmer at Walmart.  Great results from the new trimmer.</li>
    <li> Product was here so fast that I almost forgot what I ordered. This fit my T-Outliners that I keep dropping and breaking the corners of. Same exact blade, matches perfect. Except for the other smaller blade that is not pictured. I had to use some of the old parts to make this blade seat properly &amp; so I am back to cutting just after 3 days. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works perfect! Great price and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly. After zero gapping my clippers they were perfect and left a clean line. Will buy again when these dull or break.</li>
    <li> This was a exact fit for my clippers and was very easy to attach. The quality of Andis clippers are unsurpassed.</li>
    <li> My Andis trimmer was starting to nick me and pull on hairs instead of getting a good clean cut. It was starting to get pretty painful. I replaced the blade set with this replacement and it cuts like the day I bought it. Have had this for about 2 years and it still cuts great! I bought some Andis lubrication gel to go with it that I try and spray it with after a couple trims. It seems to help it stay sharp and clean.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my pivot pro</li>
    <li> Famous blades. If not number one on a Barber&#x27;s list they are certainly in the top three. For me, there is nothing better. When your blades start to get a bit old and dull you can just replace them with a few simple screws. Sticking with these for life!</li>
    <li> The blade was very dull. not what i expected.i just wish that the blades wasa little sharper. not pleased at all.</li>
    <li> Blade not sharp at all.</li>
    <li> Great product...as advertised!</li>
    <li> The blade was new and well packaged but the screws were so tight that i had to damage it to get it off. Lucky for me i had a extra.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good , very sharp came kinda slow but it was worth the weight i really have nothing bad to say , I love these linner blades. They feel so smooth , when you cut it doesnt even feel like its cutting or touching your head.S i gave it a 5 Star</li>
