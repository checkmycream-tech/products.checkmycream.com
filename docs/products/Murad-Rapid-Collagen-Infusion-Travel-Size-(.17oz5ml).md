    <li> It works better then any other product I used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irene</li>
    <li> Had reaction to product.</li>
    <li> Amazon service was great, but product was small and did not last over a week. Not a very big sample for the price.</li>
    <li> Product is just okay. Does not work as well as some of the other Murad products. Only use for travel.</li>
    <li> As all Murad products, this really makes my skin look radient, I can only afford the travel/sample sizes, but it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I just started using it so I can&#x27;t make any judgments yet but I do seem to like it sofar</li>
    <li> I have not use this product for a long time but, I love it.  Wish I had ordered a bigger size.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  I was told I COULD see results within a day, and that seemed just too unbelievable....I DID see a difference when I woke up the next morning!  I am 50, so it bugs me when i seem my 3/4 angle profile and it looks like i am sad, like a sad clown.  Ick!  This product gave me just enough NATURAL plumpness to take away that little sag around my mouth/cheek area, without making me look like I got filler injections or am on steroids.  I&#x27;m glad the price is affordable, because it it was one of those expensive $200 per ounce creams, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have given it the time of day.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and didn&#x27;t react well to this product.</li>
    <li> Being 47 it&#x27;s never too late! Take  care of your skin,you deserve something just for you! I would always buy for my family but when it came to me, I would think next time! Well not anymore</li>
    <li> I love this product and great price through amazon!</li>
    <li> visibly plumped and smoothed and lightened and brightened&lt;br /&gt;will have to get the larger size now</li>
    <li> DIdn&#x27;t do much and made my face break out</li>
    <li> Have used  for about a week and skin is soft and smooth, definitely working, skin not as dry.  Will purchase in larger size.  Glad you have travel size.  I bought the travel size to try  the product.  Delivery was fast from shipper.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have the results that it claimed it would.</li>
    <li> Every morning I started putting the Murad Rapid Collagen Infusion before I moisturize with Murad skin perfecting moisturizer.  You do notice a more smoother look.  I purchased this again in the 1.7 oz bottle.  Its the largest they sell.  Its cheaper than Sephora and murad.com.</li>
    <li> Not as good as lead to believe it dose give moisture but that is all it is good for nothing else</li>
    <li> Great cream.  Works well around my eyes at erasing wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Plus a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love Murad products and can&#x27;t wait to order more of this  &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Is a good eye treatment for crows feet</li>
