<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> worked great for my daughter and grand girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was to short and they worked with me and it was great.</li>
    <li> This flat iron does not work as well as my original black Royale flat iron that had the gold plates (ceramic).  I have curly hair, and this just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  My sister has wavy hair so I gave it to her, and she uses it without complaint.</li>
    <li> Well worth it! used an inexpensive straigthner before once I tried this one I had to order!</li>
    <li> As always, I read the reviews on this product before purchasing it. I rely heavily on the reviews of others when purchasing anything on Amazon. I was a little skeptical about buying this set online, but after reading the reviews, thought &amp;#34;Oh what the hell, it&#x27;s only $65&amp;#34;. BEST $65 I HAVE EVER SPENT ON A ROYALE SET!! It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered. I have owned several Royale Hair Straighteners, and this is exactly like the one you would get suckered into buying at the mall kiosks. I love the curling wand, it does wonders on my hair, and keeps the curls for hours. I use my straightener for curls in my long hair that stay all day long. The mini straightener is perfect for traveling with. I love the whole set and use all 3 tools all the time!</li>
    <li> I dont know if this product defective or perhaps not a real Royale. I was so excited to see the set on Amazon with such a reasonable price. So I ordered it immediately. As soon as I received it, I used it and unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do the same job as the real one. I am so disappointed that I need to return it. By the way, with this one, you can not get the 5 year manufacture warranty. If you are like me and use this product every day, it might be a good idea to buy it from authorized vendors. Good Luck!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever. I bought it for my mom and she loves it. I&#x27;m purchasing the titanium one now see if it can surpass this one.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase.  With this set it takes very little time and does not require right heat. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great quality, its the exact same thing you would find in the mall, I totally recommend it. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I bought a pair at a mall in Chicago and they were great so I bought a pair from Amazon for my mom because they work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> it isn&#x27;t like the ones they try to molest your hair with at the mall, however, it isn&#x27;t a complete piece of crapenzee either. it does the job- but watch out! it gets HOT and almost melted my will to live.</li>
    <li> Great set! They sent me all the paper to certify my product and the products work wonderfully! :D Excited to style my hair more often!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this flat iron set easy to travel with. And I love what it dose for my hair too!</li>
    <li> Not exactly like the ones in the mall I was better off buying those.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected! works great.</li>
    <li> It was the real one work awesome</li>
    <li> The hair straightener doesn&#x27;t turn on... But the mini hair straightener and the curling iron work... Doesn&#x27;t feel like the one from the mall though.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I use it all the time.  I love that I have two different sizes  for the flat irons and the curling iron I learning how to use.  It a must have.  Great variety.  Wonderful kit.  I &#x27;m so happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT USE REGULARLY NO COMPLAINTS. ..</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT MY WHOLE FAMILY WILL BE ORDERING ONE ITS AWESOME AND THE PRICE IS GREAT AT THE MALL IT COST 250.00 CRAZY PRICED LOVE THIS ITEM SOOO MUCH</li>
