      <li>works great!</li>
      <li>It may work perfectly for someone with fuller lips.</li>
      <li>My lipstick stays put for hours and even looked good after meals/cocktails.  </li>
      <li>Will be buying this product again for sure!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I love this lip pencil.  </li>
      <li>No bleeding lipcolor into the fine lines around my mouth.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to women who finds their lipstick bleeds into fine lines.</li>
      <li>The liner goes on very easy and does stop your lipstick bleeding,will certainly buy again.</li>
      <li>This product is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>My only &amp;#34;duh&amp;#34; issue is that it can&#x27;t be seen, so judging the amount I&#x27;m applying is an interesting exercise.</li>
      <li>It really does keep lipstick from feathering!  </li>
      <li>They were great in handling my complaint and all was well.</li>
      <li>For a product you can&#x27;t really see at all when you apply it, it works wonders for keeping lipstick in place !</li>
      <li>Totally clear so it does not compromise the true pigment of your lipstick/lip gloss.</li>
      <li>While this seems to help with the &amp;#34;feathering&amp;#34; of my lip products, I personally find it a bit drying to the area above the top lip.  </li>
      <li>&quot; it normally goes on to say sharpener.  </li>
      <li>It is a product that I wouldn&#x27;t want to live without.</li>
      <li>so those fine little wrinkles around the lips have appeared.  </li>
      <li>I am a 43 year old woman</li>
      <li>Unlike some other products that break and waste when trying to sharpen, this sharpens easily.</li>
      <li>Without the sharpener that is usually included, the pencil becomes useless quickly unless you are good at whittling with a sharp knife.  </li>

    <li> I use this all the time!  It really does keep lipstick from feathering!  It is a product that I wouldn&#x27;t want to live without.</li>
    <li> It does not work as advertised.</li>
    <li> The pencil itself works very well to keep your lips from getting that \\&quot;crazy old lady\\&quot; look.  I do not find that it moisturizes the area above my lips, though.  The thing to watch out for is that this purchase did not include the pencil sharpener.  In the description where it says \\&quot;Free,\\&quot; it normally goes on to say sharpener.  The pencil does not fit in a standard pencil sharpener.  Without the sharpener that is usually included, the pencil becomes useless quickly unless you are good at whittling with a sharp knife.  I am cancelling my subscription.</li>
    <li> A make up product that actually does what it says it will do... and it lasts fairly long. Unlike some other products that break and waste when trying to sharpen, this sharpens easily.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will do -- keep lipstick from feathering.  I recommend it.  It  works at least as well as the Too Faced Lip Insurance in avoiding feathering, and doesn&#x27;t have the drawbacks of Lip Insurance, which makes my lips feel dry.  I recommend using it all over your lips, not just on the outlines, so that it will keep lipstick on for hours.</li>
    <li> SOOOO thankful to have this product!  No more feathering of my lipsticks...LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I am a 43 year old woman so those fine little wrinkles around the lips have appeared.  I have tried numerous products to help stop my lipstick from feathering.  Finally, finally....I have found a product that works.  I literally threw away several items last night that didn&#x27;t work.  My lipstick stays put for hours and even looked good after meals/cocktails.  This product is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love this lip pencil.  It keeps my lipstick from bleeding into the wrinkles around my lips. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I never got to try it.  When I opened the package there was a scent that I found aggravating.  The tip of the pencil was not intact. I quickly complained to the company and they immediately told me to destroy the item and refunded my money.  They were great in handling my complaint and all was well.</li>
    <li> This product goes on smoothly, but unfortunately crumbles up around your lips throughout the day. I had hoped it would last a lot longer and not have to worry about either wiping it off or reapplying.</li>
    <li> I like this and it seems to work. My only &amp;#34;duh&amp;#34; issue is that it can&#x27;t be seen, so judging the amount I&#x27;m applying is an interesting exercise.</li>
    <li> This is the answer to everyone&#x27;s lip liner crisis&#x27;s... Totally clear so it does not compromise the true pigment of your lipstick/lip gloss.</li>
    <li> It was broken when I got it, a little bit doesn&#x27;t go very far and it doesn&#x27;t help my lipstick at all. Waste of money</li>
    <li> works like it should.</li>
    <li> The liner goes on very easy and does stop your lipstick bleeding,will certainly buy again. Would recommend this to women who finds their lipstick bleeds into fine lines.</li>
    <li> i notice zero difference when i use this...</li>
    <li> While this seems to help with the &amp;#34;feathering&amp;#34; of my lip products, I personally find it a bit drying to the area above the top lip.  I&#x27;m 61 and have a thinning upper lip.  It may work perfectly for someone with fuller lips.</li>
    <li> works great! lipstick and liner stay and do not bleed or feather. I need this because i use dark lipsticks in reds and purples to blacks and dark colors are so obvious when they feather. ( FYI- i also bought an Urban Decay anti-feathering lipliner which was more expensive and it was wayyyy inferior to Too Faced.) Will be buying this product again for sure!</li>
    <li> For a product you can&#x27;t really see at all when you apply it, it works wonders for keeping lipstick in place ! I use it every time I wear lip stick, and especially with reds !</li>
    <li> It works! No bleeding lipcolor into the fine lines around my mouth. BRAVO!</li>
