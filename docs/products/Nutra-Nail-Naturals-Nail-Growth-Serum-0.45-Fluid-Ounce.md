      <li>my nails seem to be growing quicker and it&#x27;s a nice supplement to put on before cuticle oil.</li>

      <li>She has not required any trips to the nail salon since she began using this and her nails look healthier and better than ever.</li>
      <li>the nail growth was okay</li>
      <li>I keep nail polish on my nails 24/7, and this keeps nails healthy underneath.</li>
      <li>Now with this, I&#x27;m confident that they&#x27;ll grow to the length I&#x27;ve always wanted them to be.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>It absorbs faster, is easier to apply because of the brush applicator, and for my nails it seemed to strengthen better.  </li>
      <li>My nails look hydrated and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Still love buying</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this products I use it day and nite and</li>
      <li>My nails have looked healthy and, yes, even grew to a desired medium length.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely the most amazing product I have ever purchased!</li>
      <li>Great product, easy to apply but can&#x27;t really tell if it has made any difference in my&lt;br /&gt;nails</li>
      <li>The nail bed is slowly becoming a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>no shine  no allergic ingredients  easy to brush on nails and</li>
      <li>Will repurchase-also received very quickly.</li>
      <li>I started a nail journey and I have gone from nail biter to the proud owner of long strong nails.</li>
      <li>My nails grow like wild fire which its great when you need to grown out a repaired break ;)  </li>
      <li>First off, my cuticles are much better than before.</li>
      <li>Works great, I always make sure I keep at least 2 on hand :)</li>
      <li>I apply this once a day and have noticed significant improvement in nail strength and growth.</li>
      <li>You really should have this available in more stores.</li>
      <li>Nothing special, did not help my nails at all.</li>
      <li>But the most amazing thing is how much it has improved a completely deformed thumb nail.</li>
      <li>This product does not make your nails grow more, but it hydrates them very well, and thus helps preventing chipping and breakage.</li>
      <li>no bad smell...</li>
      <li>On the back of the box it said something like, for best results use twice daily.</li>
      <li>but it absorbs quickly and does the job.</li>
      <li>Made my nails grow quickly,  just used it in the morning</li>
      <li>and plus, 4 stars because it helps the nails to grow at a normal, steady rate..not freakishly fast, which would be great.</li>
      <li>They are much stronger, don&#x27;t break as easily and grow faster.</li>
      <li>Leaves my cuticles and under the nails moisturized - just like a good hand lotion for dry hands.</li>
      <li>product did absorb quickly, and seems to have all the right ingredients in it, however, it just didn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
      <li>I bought this product in February of this year and my nails are now a half inch long with no nail polish and incredibly strong and beautiful!</li>
      <li>I see a distinct difference in my nail strength when I take it.  </li>
      <li>It is a thicker lotion-like substance that you put on and rub into the nails and cuticles and is absorbed into the nail.  </li>
      <li>Nutra nail products are allot better than Sally Hansen, OPI, ESSIE and the other name brand that cost allot more.  </li>
      <li>If anyone knows of something that makes nails grow super fast, please comment and let me know!</li>
      <li>cuticles  expect to use this forever now that I&#x27;d used it into a second bottle  fairly priced  highly recommended</li>
      <li>read directions--rub in 1-2x/day--the right product type</li>
      <li>I would strongly recommend to others as I have to my friends and family who want their nails to grow beautiful after using fake nails.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend using this to strengthen your nails!!</li>
      <li>I have used this for 6 months and it does exactly what it claims.  </li>
      <li>On my first bottle, I would use this 2-3 times a week.</li>
      <li>So I put it on first thing in the morning and</li>
      <li>but it really does work!  </li>
      <li>Oh, and the other nails look better too!</li>
      <li>The list of ingredients seems pretty harmless.</li>
      <li>At first I thought this product was damaging nh nails.</li>
      <li>I repurchased it after finishing the first bottle.</li>
      <li>but this is the first product that keeps my nails from cracking and chipping.  </li>
      <li>I still don&#x27;t know what happened but from July 2012 to January 2013 all 10 of my nails were split far below the white tip area and then split  on top of that!</li>
      <li>So far, this product has significantly reduced this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My nails are normally prone to peeling and breaking; I brush a little underneath my nails every day to keep them healthy and strong.</li>
      <li>After 4-5 weeks of wearing nail wraps, my nails went from beautifully healthy to trashed even though I was extremely careful to make sure the nails were clean before applying and was very careful to remove them gently.</li>
      <li>I do still have some mild chips and peeling as the old nail grows out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product does everything it promises. I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this. And I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s been great at addressing the issues I&#x27;ve had with my nails peeling. I can let them grow a lot longer now as opposed to having to cut them constantly. Even at their shortest they would peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have noticed an unusual side effect when using this. On some of my fingernails, I&#x27;ve noticed when using this often, my nails would develop this weird (though very subtle) downward curve/curl in them. It&#x27;s sort of unsightly when my nails get long, but I can compensate usually by reshaping them a certain way. I don&#x27;t know what the cause of this is, but I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s from using it too much. On my first bottle, I would use this 2-3 times a week. Now that I&#x27;m on my second bottle, I only use this about once a week, sometimes once every 2 weeks, and that seems to help.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to apply but can&#x27;t really tell if it has made any difference in my&lt;br /&gt;nails</li>
    <li> Really grows yoir nails</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. It&#x27;s a serum, not a polish which is what I wanted. Great product</li>
    <li> I like it! i hope it works for my nails</li>
    <li> used a couple of times leaves nails moisturizd and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Nothing special, did not help my nails at all.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference and I used it for a month. Nails still break very easily and did not seem to grow any faster</li>
    <li> My nails are noticeably longer in less than 1 week. They had practically stopped growing at all for months! idk what was wrong. But this is working so I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
    <li> This is really great for my nails I use it weekly after my cuticle remover and after a month and pretty impressed with how much better my nails look.  They are healing from the gel nail color fiasco.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It has really helped my nails a lot to become stronger and longer and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend using this to strengthen your nails!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Works great, I always make sure I keep at least 2 on hand :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product religiously for a few month now and I love it! Consistency is the key tho.  I apply it twice a day no matter what!  I apply it in the mornings under the nails making sure not to work with water for at least half an hour and I also apply it again at bedtime.  My nails grow like wild fire which its great when you need to grown out a repaired break ;)  Also, when I do my mani, after I&#x27;ve finished, I leave my nails bare for at least an hour or over night whichever works out for me at the time, and I apply this gem all over the nails and I massage it in.  My nails look hydrated and healthy.  As like with anything else, using it consistently is the key but it really does work!  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> My nails would grow then break grow then break grow then split so I looked into some products and other things worked but really slow and I bought this and 1 month later my nails are actually to the point where I have to cut them and this works like a dream! I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used this for 6 months and it does exactly what it claims.  I wanted beautiful, natural nails for my sister&#x27;s wedding and this product had my nails looking great.  I have also used NutraNails Nailsentials growth serum and I prefer this.  It absorbs faster, is easier to apply because of the brush applicator, and for my nails it seemed to strengthen better.  I also found three other things helped me with nail growth.&lt;br /&gt;1) Use rubber gloves when doing dishes and laundry to protect nails.&lt;br /&gt;2) Avoid nail polish, even the ones that claim they strengthen. None of them strengthen better than this.  If I do want to use polish, I don&#x27;t leave it on long because they all dry out my nails.&lt;br /&gt;3) Take Phyto Therapy Liquid Calcium.  I see a distinct difference in my nail strength when I take it.  I think of it as treating the nails both inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 3/2014&lt;br /&gt;I am adding some pictures of my nail experience after a little foray into Jamberry and Essie Nail wraps. After 4-5 weeks of wearing nail wraps, my nails went from beautifully healthy to trashed even though I was extremely careful to make sure the nails were clean before applying and was very careful to remove them gently. I used Nutra Nail serum to bring them back to health so I&#x27;ve attached before and after pictures.  For anyone dealing with a similar experience, I did find it helpful to buff the splitting, flaking nails down pretty aggressively.  It seemed that I had more success with them not continuing to peel after buffing them down then I had before even though I was applying the serum.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this product was damaging nh nails. And I still believe it did. On the back of the box it said something like, for best results use twice daily. That&#x27;s what did. It absorbs nicely into your nails and didn&#x27;t leave a residue, or at least nothing visable. So I put it on first thing in the morning and last thing at night, after all that is what the box said to do. DON&#x27;T DO THAT!!! My nail indeed were growing faster but they were peeling and chipping, snagging and cracking. As soon as I completely stopped using the product my nail grew back to how they usually were. Then I began using it on just my pinky nail once every... maybe 6 days. No peeling or anything like what I experiencd before. 3+ stars because the product did do what it was supposed to,  2- because the usage they suggested was completely wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps,  the sent of the product is in no way chemical ish. And reminds me of honey suckle</li>
    <li> Love this product its making nail thicker and stronger  and they are growing that never happened before with any other product</li>
    <li> I see no change whatsoever in my nails.  Very disappointing</li>
    <li> I still don&#x27;t know what happened but from July 2012 to January 2013 all 10 of my nails were split far below the white tip area and then split  on top of that! I tried a million remedies. It was so shocking that I even went to the doctor because I thought it had to be an indication of a serious health problem. I bought this product in February of this year and my nails are now a half inch long with no nail polish and incredibly strong and beautiful! Absolutely the most amazing product I have ever purchased!</li>
    <li> This product does not make your nails grow more, but it hydrates them very well, and thus helps preventing chipping and breakage. This is the best that you can hope for from a product like this. The list of ingredients seems pretty harmless. I repurchased it after finishing the first bottle.</li>
    <li> My nails are getting longer and longer the more I use the Nutra Nail Naturals Nail Growth Serum! Thank you!</li>
    <li> If you are looking to grow your nails...this is the way to go...I&#x27;m in love with this products I use it day and nite and in between I carry this on my pocketbook.</li>
    <li> Great for weak, spliting nails...I use them daily a week before I polish my nais, then one day between removing old and putting on new polish...really makes a difference!</li>
    <li> Still love buying this cause it works thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a couple of times but it seems to be something I will continue to use as a nail treatment to improve and strengthen my nails.  It is a thicker lotion-like substance that you put on and rub into the nails and cuticles and is absorbed into the nail.  It feels like it might be a good thing for the nails.</li>
    <li> Received this product way before delivery date. Started using it the same day. I can see results already. I have nail growth. my nails stopped chipping. I plan to use it twice a day for 2 weeks without polish.  To give my nails some rest and time to grow. I feel this growth serum is really working. i will in the near future purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I apply this once a day and have noticed significant improvement in nail strength and growth. They are much stronger, don&#x27;t break as easily and grow faster. I have beautiful nails! I&#x27;ll continue to use this product as long as they continue to make it!</li>
    <li> No biggie. Nails not really growing. Grrrrrr....</li>
    <li> this stuff works  strengthens nails  no smell  no shine  no allergic ingredients  easy to brush on nails and cuticles  expect to use this forever now that I&#x27;d used it into a second bottle  fairly priced  highly recommended</li>
    <li> This product really works no more brittle nails would recommend this  product I have used now for a month. Good Product Good Service</li>
    <li> Made my nails grow quickly,  just used it in the morning and before I went to bed like three nights in a row. This serum absorbs into nails and makes them feel stronger.  I recommend this to anyone growing out their nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this nail growth serum on my nails twice a day for 4 days, and I can already tell the difference. My nails feel stronger and are growing longer. I have been picking/biting off my nails my whole life and hated the way my nails looked -- (short and jagged) Now with this, I&#x27;m confident that they&#x27;ll grow to the length I&#x27;ve always wanted them to be. Recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is the only product I have found that truly works. My nails are longer and stronger than they have ever been.</li>
    <li> Leaves my cuticles and under the nails moisturized - just like a good hand lotion for dry hands. Loved this.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for my nails, maybe it&#x27;s the way I also tae care of my nails</li>
    <li> Used it to strengthen my nails prior to my wedding, was having issues with peeling at the ends. It worked great. I&#x27;m continuing to use it on my  nails after because I had a gel manicure and it damaged a few of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nail serum for months now and I&#x27;ve noticed a great difference from the first use, no joke. It conditions the nails so well and keeps them well hydrated all day. I have a bad habit of biting my nails but this stuff has made me not want to bite them because of how great they look now. I try to use it every night if I remember and sometimes I use it twice a day. This is by far the fastest nail growing treatment I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot!!) and the best part is its not filled with a bunch of bad ingredients like all the other nail products out there and I really feel that&#x27;s why it works so well.</li>
    <li> This product improved the quality of my natural nails in about 7 days.  My nails are healthy but tend to get tiny stress tears if the free edge gets too long.  I noticed my nails responded well to this product and they feel stronger.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 5 months now and nails are definitely growing faster. I recommend using once in the morning and once before bed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought products from salons, department store cosmetic counters, drugstores etc. but this is the first product that keeps my nails from cracking and chipping.  The only caveat is that it must be used religiously to get the full benefit but it absorbs quickly and does the job.</li>
    <li> Very good product that  nourishes nails&lt;br /&gt;Has helped  with splitting .</li>
    <li> I started a nail journey and I have gone from nail biter to the proud owner of long strong nails. I think this definitely helped. I feel this serum is part of the reason for why my nails grow at the rate they do now. Usually they grow slowly, but if I apply this and let it soak in about twice a week, I see results. Nice and easy to apply..absorbs well..no bad smell...nice product...I give it 4 stars because me saying it makes my nails grow faster is an opinion...I believe it does help but that&#x27;s not fact...and plus, 4 stars because it helps the nails to grow at a normal, steady rate..not freakishly fast, which would be great. If anyone knows of something that makes nails grow super fast, please comment and let me know!</li>
    <li> Really grows your nails no doubt about it</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum and it is the best.  For those reviews that say that it doesn&#x27;t work for them,  I would like to say that it takes time.  Do not expect it to work within a week.  I use it every morning when I know that all my chores are done and will not be putting my hands in water for about 2-3 hours, then I use it at night.  Nutra nail products are allot better than Sally Hansen, OPI, ESSIE and the other name brand that cost allot more.  I would strongly recommend to others as I have to my friends and family who want their nails to grow beautiful after using fake nails.</li>
    <li> Started using this after seeing a YouTube video and it&#x27;s great- my nails seem to be growing quicker and it&#x27;s a nice supplement to put on before cuticle oil.</li>
    <li> I had gel nails for a while and needed something to help me grow my natural nails faster and make them stronger. So far Nutra Nail Naturals is doing just that.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product for a few weeks but it seems to help.  I can evaluate better after a few months.  It is a nice product to use--not messy.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s nails and cuticles have stayed hydrated and beautiful. She has not required any trips to the nail salon since she began using this and her nails look healthier and better than ever.</li>
    <li> Seems to be effective strengthening my nails and also making them have a smoother appearance.  I have an auto immune disease and my skin, nails etc. are affected. I am always trying to prove their condition and this seems to help. Hopefully this continues. Will repurchase-also received very quickly.</li>
    <li> I thought this wouldn&#x27;t work to be honest but this stuff is amazing! My nails are so strong!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Works!!! Will never go without it! Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry. Makes my fingers so soft and my cuticles don&#x27;t split or callus up from drying out. I don&#x27;t even use cuticle oil anymore just this, it&#x27;s all you need for beautiful nails n cuticles.</li>
    <li> not a serum as sally h.. but these hydr... w/ glycerin, etc. formulas, applied 1-2x/day WORK. prevent brittleness which causes breaks, snags. only type that does. read directions--rub in 1-2x/day--the right product type</li>
    <li> but to be honest, it could be me.  I had decided to take a break from the cost of acrylics, but in doing so and trying to use this product and another product, with very little positive results, I decided I remembered why I started using acrylics in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did absorb quickly, and seems to have all the right ingredients in it, however, it just didn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
    <li> My nails have never been stronger</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. My nails are normally prone to peeling and breaking; I brush a little underneath my nails every day to keep them healthy and strong. I keep nail polish on my nails 24/7, and this keeps nails healthy underneath.</li>
    <li> It works! I&#x27;m so happy with the results. I also noticed it makes my nails stronger and resistant to breaking. The shipping was super fast, overall I recommend it :)</li>
    <li> OMG this is soo good!!! My nails look their best.</li>
    <li> I had been unable to grow healthy, beautiful nails, even after trying numerous other products.  However, the Nutra Nail Serum is just what I needed.  My nails have looked healthy and, yes, even grew to a desired medium length.  You really should have this available in more stores.</li>
    <li> My daughter is using this and can tell already that her nails are growing. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, this product seems to be delivering what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nail problems included dryness, chipping, and severe peeling. I would have my nails cut as short as they possibly could go, and I was still having pieces at the tips peeling off.  So far, this product has significantly reduced this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a serum type product that absorbs into the nails.  I like to apply one coat and let it soak in, and then I do another coat that I massage into the nail and cuticle.  It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, so I do still have some mild chips and peeling as the old nail grows out.  But it&#x27;s significantly reduced, and I actually have &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; nails again in just a matter of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have zero complaints for this product so far, and I&#x27;ll be back to update if any come to mind. It&#x27;s not greasy, no foul or lingering odor, very good price, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> Per instructions on the package I applied this to my bare nails, then proceeded with my regular nail polish. Within 24 hours, my polish literally peeled off! This was a complete waste of $$$.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 weeks now, and am very impressed with the results. First off, my cuticles are much better than before. But the most amazing thing is how much it has improved a completely deformed thumb nail. (I&#x27;ve lost the entire nail twice.) The nail bed is slowly becoming a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shape instead of something that looks like a train wreck. The new nail growth, little as it is so far, appears to be solid nail instead of flaky bits and pieces. I don&#x27;t know how much, if any, additional improvement there will be, but I plan to keep using this. Nothing else has ever worked on this nail, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products over the last several decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it is a serum that sinks into the nail rather than something that hardens like a polish. I&#x27;ve been using it on bare nails, which may be a factor in speeding its effectiveness. Oh, and the other nails look better too!</li>
    <li> the nail growth was okay, I didn&#x27;t believe that it did wonders.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how amazing this product is. So fast growing nails grew within a week of time so awesome!!!</li>
