      <li>I LOVE this, just ordered my 4th bottle.</li>
      <li>Gift, all these products are outstanding</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion (from another website) because it contains alpha lipoic acid, one of my favorite anti-aging skincare ingredients.</li>
      <li>I have been using this cream for a year or so, and I love it.</li>
      <li>Is it better than the Zia one?</li>
      <li>Perfect for all seasons, especially the summer.</li>
      <li>Also, this has a nice, light scent.  </li>
      <li>I am glad about that, but would have continued purchasing this product at almost any price.</li>
      <li>I tried the oil-free moisturizer because I have combination skin and most moisturizers tend to give me a shiny forehead.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin soft and hydrated and looks great under make-up.  </li>
      <li>The Zia doen&#x27;t give me much shine and is also good for the dryer areas of my face.  </li>
      <li>Drawback - glass jar that can break really easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light and absorbs easily.</li>
      <li>A fine product for moisture without blocking skin pores.</li>
      <li>It has a very lovely, light orange-like fragrance and feels so nice on my face especially in the summer.</li>
      <li>During the winter, I do use a heavier moisturizer on my dryer areas as the Zia is too light for those areas but still does a fine job on my oilier areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are more than worth the cost...</li>
      <li>Light, soft, absorbent, smells nice.</li>
      <li>This is a great all-natural, organic face moisturizer, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t clog pores but still keeps my skin from getting to dried out.  </li>
      <li>This product absorbs nicely and has not irritated by very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with Zia products in general.  </li>
      <li>This really moisturizes without feeling oily, just refreshing.  </li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re good overall as a brand.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is lightweight, refreshing, neither oily nor overly dry after it absorbs into the skin, &amp; the light citrusy scent is uplifting &amp; enjoyable.</li>
      <li>This is a super lightweight serum consistency and absorbs immediately.</li>
      <li>You really can tell it absorbs into the skin, and is easy to wear under make up.  </li>
      <li>Most people mistake my adult sons for my husband or boyfriend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not inexpensive, but it&#x27;s worth it for the result.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Zia Ultimate Oil Free Moisturizer for sevral years and love it.</li>
      <li>So you will go through a bottle pretty quickly if you use twice a day.  </li>
      <li>This particular product is magical as far as my face is concerned</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so soft, and light</li>
      <li>I used to purchase this product from another online store that charges a lot more for the exact same thing.</li>
      <li>It even works pretty well through the winter, although if you have drier skin, you may wish to switch to a heavier product in the winter.  </li>
      <li>, that has a very off-putting smell!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a bit pricey compared to non-organic products, but for organic products they&#x27;re pretty reasonable and very high quality.</li>
      <li>but I really like this product.</li>
      <li>The only oil free moisturizer that works for me.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>so I really trusted the review&#x27;s posted on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Does not feel heavy or greasy and does not make my face perspire in warm weather.</li>
      <li>It sinks right in and leaves my skin nice and moisturized with no extra shine.</li>
      <li>Two ounces lasts a really long time for me because I use this primarily as a hand lotion at work rather than for my face, though sometimes I use it on my face too if it feels particularly parched.&lt;br</li>
      <li>of).&lt;br /&gt;Happy to find a new place to get it!</li>
      <li>Better priced than some, more expensive than others.</li>
      <li>and I highly recomend this lotion.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I normally cannot tolerate anything with a fragrance</li>
      <li>Zia has come out with new product lines since this one</li>
      <li>No breakouts so far.  </li>
      <li>Zia Natural Skincare</li>
      <li>I like to blend in a natural SPFf to it in the AM and use it alone in the PM.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and get compliments on how young I look.</li>
      <li>It goes on light and smoothly, never oily.</li>
      <li>It is very lightweight and it sounds cliche, but your skin really does &#x27;drink&#x27; it in...doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, or greasy.  </li>
      <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could only find this at Whole Foods for the longest time, and both the ones closest to me have stopped selling it (all they have is the Zia Naturals now, which I am not a fan</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use any products with oils, and this is the only oil-free natural moisturizer that I have tried that I like.  </li>
      <li>- I put it on right after I get out of the shower, and it feels like nothing&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;Small bottles, but a little goes</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it a 4 because it is a bit mild for harsh winter months.</li>
      <li>When they say &#x27;oil free&#x27; they mean it.</li>
      <li>This is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that solves the dry, flaky skin problems I get, after washing my face, without causing an oily mess on some areas of my face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Which requires no oil, but  for use on a continuous basis it does not provide the moisturizing my &amp;#34;Sr Citizen&amp;#34; skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, you can always trust this company for excellent  safe ingredients</li>
    <li> Gift, all these products are outstanding</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion (from another website) because it contains alpha lipoic acid, one of my favorite anti-aging skincare ingredients. The lotion is lightweight, refreshing, neither oily nor overly dry after it absorbs into the skin, &amp; the light citrusy scent is uplifting &amp; enjoyable. I like the good ingredients in this lotion (except for the parabens!). Two ounces lasts a really long time for me because I use this primarily as a hand lotion at work rather than for my face, though sometimes I use it on my face too if it feels particularly parched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is great packaging too - frosted glass pump bottle that can be reused, &amp; the dispenser swivels open/closed so there&#x27;s no extra cap needed. I got this for $22 just 3 months ago &amp; suddenly I see that the price jumped $5-$6 at the place from where I bought this - that&#x27;s disappointing! But I like the lotion enough to likely repurchase even at the higher price (though unhappily).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zia Ultimate Oil Free Moisturizer for sevral years and love it. They store no longer carries this line so i shopped online and found it through amazon. I usually purchase 4 at a time and did so in October. Unfortunatly I was also recieving a product that I did not order and started refusing shipments (not realizing that Zia was one of them). in looking through my emails i did notice that amazon contacted me about a return but there was nothing about what product it was. i sent an email back and asked about it, they still had it in thier return area but did not confirm what the product was until it was too late! because personal care items are not returnable! $92.00 down the drain as they &amp;#34;discarded&amp;#34; the items. ugh...</li>
    <li> Oil containing products make me break out so I&#x27;ve always had to use one of the much less common oil-free mositurizers.  After a few weeks of using the Zia, I was astonished at how much happier and youthful my skin looked.  It absorbs well and I don&#x27;t feel anything on my skin once it&#x27;s in.  In winter I sometimes have to reapply a little at night. It doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen.  It&#x27;s not inexpensive, but it&#x27;s worth it for the result.  Zia has come out with new product lines since this one and I&#x27;ve tried a few and they&#x27;re good overall as a brand.  This particular product is magical as far as my face is concerned and I hope they never discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I have been sampling serums and moisturizers and I find myself comparing whatever I&#x27;m trying to this moisturizer every time. Is it better than the Zia one? No? I&#x27;ll pass. When they say &#x27;oil free&#x27; they mean it. This is a super lightweight serum consistency and absorbs immediately. Doesn&#x27;t leave a film or creamy oily feeling sitting on my skin. The citrusy scent is nice. This is perfect for my combination skin during spring, summer and fall. I do sometimes need a thicker moisturizer during winter, as this will not touch the flakes. The price for this is just fine - I would even pay more for it because its so great. If they could improve on it at all, it would be removing or replacing the parabens in it.</li>
    <li> This moisture lotion is very, very nice for someone that has oily skin. I have been using it for a year now and reordered. I have seen a differance in the skin even on my neck and chest area. Love it! and I highly recomend this lotion. I will continue to use their products. I also ordered the mask. Love too.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This really moisturizes without feeling oily, just refreshing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and get compliments on how young I look.</li>
    <li> This is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that solves the dry, flaky skin problems I get, after washing my face, without causing an oily mess on some areas of my face. I really like it. The bottle lasts a long time, also.</li>
    <li> This is a great all-natural, organic face moisturizer, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t clog pores but still keeps my skin from getting to dried out.  It even works pretty well through the winter, although if you have drier skin, you may wish to switch to a heavier product in the winter.  Also, this has a nice, light scent.  I&#x27;m very pleased with Zia products in general.  They&#x27;re a bit pricey compared to non-organic products, but for organic products they&#x27;re pretty reasonable and very high quality.</li>
    <li> It smell horrible! I returned it</li>
    <li> I normally cannot tolerate anything with a fragrance but I really like this product. It has a very lovely, light orange-like fragrance and feels so nice on my face especially in the summer. I would buy it again but not the Ultimate Cleansing Mousse from the same line, that has a very off-putting smell!</li>
    <li> It is a natural product and just wonderful.  No greasy feeling and a little goes a long way.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The only oil free moisturizer that works for me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so soft, and light - I put it on right after I get out of the shower, and it feels like nothing&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;Small bottles, but a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could only find this at Whole Foods for the longest time, and both the ones closest to me have stopped selling it (all they have is the Zia Naturals now, which I am not a fan of).&lt;br /&gt;Happy to find a new place to get it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this, just ordered my 4th bottle. I like to blend in a natural SPFf to it in the AM and use it alone in the PM. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Wonderful....I took a risk with this product.  I did not know anything about ZIA so I really trusted the review&#x27;s posted on Amazon.  I purchased and now am on my 3rd bottle, repeat purchase.  It is very lightweight and it sounds cliche, but your skin really does &#x27;drink&#x27; it in...doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, or greasy.  You really can tell it absorbs into the skin, and is easy to wear under make up.  I noticed results, too, my skin looked smoother when I would catch a glimpse of myself smiling or laughing in the mirror,  Wrinkles not as pronounced.  The formula is thin though, and so I used about 4 pumps per application. So you will go through a bottle pretty quickly if you use twice a day.  But I am on a tight budget, and think that the results are noticeable enough that I justify repeat purchases.</li>
    <li> I have tried a LOT of oil-free moisturizers, and this is my fave. It sinks right in and leaves my skin nice and moisturized with no extra shine. This is my winter moisturizer for my allover oily skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite face cream. Great sent. Absorbs with no oily shine.</li>
    <li> Zia has some good products.  I tried the oil-free moisturizer because I have combination skin and most moisturizers tend to give me a shiny forehead.  The Zia doen&#x27;t give me much shine and is also good for the dryer areas of my face.  During the winter, I do use a heavier moisturizer on my dryer areas as the Zia is too light for those areas but still does a fine job on my oilier areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light and absorbs easily. The fragrance is very light and good for men.  The ingredients list is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that it&#x27;s a little pricy for what you get.  Better priced than some, more expensive than others.</li>
    <li> I resent the requirement of twenty more words to say that this is an excellent moisturizer!  However, it is.  So there!!!</li>
    <li> This product absorbs nicely and has not irritated by very sensitive skin.  It calms and hydrates.  No breakouts so far.  Would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> A fine product for moisture without blocking skin pores. I have used it for years. Five more words  needed, silly Amazon.</li>
    <li> The product is perfect for my skin. It goes on light and smoothly, never oily. Perfect for all seasons, especially the summer. Does not feel heavy or greasy and does not make my face perspire in warm weather. My face is soft, subtle and young looking. Most people mistake my adult sons for my husband or boyfriend. My grandchildren, one who is 22, are always referred to as my children. I used to purchase this product from another online store that charges a lot more for the exact same thing. I happened to be browsing through Amazon.com and discovered it for a lower price. I am glad about that, but would have continued purchasing this product at almost any price. It is that good. All Zia Skincare Products that I use are excellent. They are more than worth the cost...</li>
    <li> Light, smells great, restores moisture with zero heaviness or oil. Please make this forever and ever and ever. Drawback - glass jar that can break really easily.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a year or so, and I love it. Light, soft, absorbent, smells nice. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It leaves my skin happy and doesn&#x27;t break me out. I have acne and I tried a new moisturizer at the beginning of summer and switched back after my face went crazy! The only reason I gave it a 4 because it is a bit mild for harsh winter months.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use any products with oils, and this is the only oil-free natural moisturizer that I have tried that I like.  It makes my skin soft and hydrated and looks great under make-up.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Zia Natural Skincare Ultimate Oil-free Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;is the very best ever as far as I am concerned and&lt;br /&gt;I am a lifer with this product, It has a nice fresh&lt;br /&gt;orange peel smell, not oily and enters your skin&lt;br /&gt;very gracefully; a little goes a long way. As far&lt;br /&gt;as I know it is not sold in any Health Stores anymore,&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find out I could get it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of people I know after telling them about it are&lt;br /&gt;using it and they just love it also, so my words to all the&lt;br /&gt;Ladies who are looking for a excellent Moisturizer Zia Oil-Free Moisture&lt;br /&gt;is the God sent Moisturizer.</li>
