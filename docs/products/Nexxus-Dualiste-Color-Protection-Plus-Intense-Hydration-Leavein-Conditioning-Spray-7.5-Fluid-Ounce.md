      <li>I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>Very strongly scented!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;:Thursday reg shampoo &amp; a good conditioner</li>
      <li>Very good result for shiny and beautiful hair result on every day live in result.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>easily gets split ends and wanted good hair for a change...</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent without being too strong.  </li>
      <li>I bought 2 bottles of this and will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>and it seems to be better.</li>
      <li>I have to wash it more.</li>
      <li>Love, love this leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the Nexxus brand products and keep trying different ones for my fine and frizzy hair; this one works great.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products and find that this is the most effective so far.</li>
      <li>I have fine but somewhat curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Recently I was shown Infusium 23 Spray on Leave in Conditioner and it was very light and felt good.</li>
      <li>It goes on more like wildly over-scented hairspray, but once it dries your hair does not feel sticky.</li>
      <li>It is getting harder to find a good leave on condition.</li>
      <li>I love the product, its the best i have ever found to tame down my frizz and softens very well.</li>
      <li>My hair is extremely fine and most products weigh it down or make it feel gunky - that never happens with this Nexxus product.</li>
      <li>When I use this conditioner I don&#x27;t even know I have it in, which is exactly what I want...</li>
      <li>Love this a detangled for my daughter who has long hair...</li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t be buying this again, because FLORAL, but the product seems to be very high quality.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>REALLY scented.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t go without having it.</li>
      <li>VERY.</li>
      <li>Service is fast.</li>
      <li>Other than that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be ripping the color from my hair, and goes on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>Hair is soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>It seems to work well when I need to detangle my hair and also leaves it conditioned and soft.</li>
      <li>Anyways i destroyed it completely...</li>
      <li>I was looking for something to replace the old formula for catwalk.</li>
      <li>But, at the same time leaves it light and not weighed down like some leave in conditioners can do.</li>
      <li>I live in CA where the air is dry.</li>
      <li>So what i did was i bought the Macadamia Deep Repair Masque ( be careful who you get it from) and the Nexxus Dualiste Color Protection Plus Intense Hydration, Leave-in Conditioning Spray...</li>

<li> Use this every other shampooing instead of using conditioner.</li>
<li> I like the smell, but product is too small for price to me, and I just wish it was bigger..</li>
<li> Helps to keep my hair moisturize and shiny without weighing down</li>
<li> Like you turn your head while driving to check your blind spot and feel like you&#x27;re getting blasted with cheap pefume.</li>
<li> This conditioner is hard to find in stores</li>
<li> no more shine, breakage like some fat dude in tight pants, everything bad...</li>
<li> /&gt;Basically this works for me because i have thin crappy hair</li>
<li> In January 6, 2012... i dyed my hair 3 times in one week ( i remember the date because it was a stupid thing to do to my hair)</li>

    <li> Very good result for shiny and beautiful hair result on every day live in result. I&#x27;ll buy it again and again when I can</li>
    <li> This gives body and conditions the hair.  I have tried many products and find that this is the most effective so far. We find that leavein conditioning works well.  It has a nice scent without being too strong.  My husband tried it out and likes it also.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It is getting harder to find a good leave on condition. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Very strongly scented! VERY. Like you turn your head while driving to check your blind spot and feel like you&#x27;re getting blasted with cheap pefume. Other than that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be ripping the color from my hair, and goes on very smoothly. I was worried since it is a spray and not a goopy conditioner feeling paste. It goes on more like wildly over-scented hairspray, but once it dries your hair does not feel sticky. Just scented. REALLY scented. I probably won&#x27;t be buying this again, because FLORAL, but the product seems to be very high quality. Not really seeing the kind of results I would expect from something this expensive, but I suppose my hair isn&#x27;t going to turn to gold from using this.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is hard to find in stores so I have turned to amazon to order this when I need it. I really can&#x27;t go without having it. It seems to work well when I need to detangle my hair and also leaves it conditioned and soft. But, at the same time leaves it light and not weighed down like some leave in conditioners can do. When I use this conditioner I don&#x27;t even know I have it in, which is exactly what I want...it does it&#x27;s job without me noticing it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> I have fine but somewhat curly hair.  I can use this with or without a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt; Either way I use it , my hair turns out great!  I bought 2 bottles of this and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and will continue to use it. I live in CA where the air is dry. this product re hydrates my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the Nexxus brand products and keep trying different ones for my fine and frizzy hair; this one works great. Helps to keep my hair moisturize and shiny without weighing down</li>
    <li> Love, love this leave in conditioner. My hair is extremely fine and most products weigh it down or make it feel gunky - that never happens with this Nexxus product.</li>
    <li> I love the product, its the best i have ever found to tame down my frizz and softens very well.</li>
    <li> Service is fast. I&#x27;m happy. Thanks</li>
    <li> Works great.  Use this every other shampooing instead of using conditioner. Hair is soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Love this a detangled for my daughter who has long hair... Works great</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to replace the old formula for catwalk. This leaves my hair gummy. I have to wash it more. I diluted it with water, to make it thinner and it seems to be better. Recently I was shown Infusium 23 Spray on Leave in Conditioner and it was very light and felt good. I&#x27;m using this one up, then will buy that.</li>
    <li> I will buy my hair products from here from now on.... i saved a bundle of money and didnt have to leave the house!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but product is too small for price to me, and I just wish it was bigger..</li>
    <li> This product works great on my hair.  I try to keep a supply on hand all the time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> In January 6, 2012... i dyed my hair 3 times in one week ( i remember the date because it was a stupid thing to do to my hair) Anyways i destroyed it completely... no more shine, breakage like some fat dude in tight pants, everything bad... i regretted it and badly wanted my hair healthy again. So what i did was i bought the Macadamia Deep Repair Masque ( be careful who you get it from) and the Nexxus Dualiste Color Protection Plus Intense Hydration, Leave-in Conditioning Spray... And wow my hair in less than 3 weeks improved big time. ever since that i use both after i highlight my hair. Ladies now i think its best... because to me this is pricey, use it when you dont wash your hair...&lt;br /&gt;For example&lt;br /&gt;:Monday shampoo hair &amp; condition&lt;br /&gt;:Tuesday spray nexxus&lt;br /&gt;:Wednesday shampoo &amp; macadamia&lt;br /&gt;:Thursday reg shampoo &amp; a good conditioner&lt;br /&gt;:Friday Nexxus spray&lt;br /&gt;:Saturday shampoo &amp; macadamia&lt;br /&gt;:Sunday Spilt end treatment &amp; Volume shampoo..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this works for me because i have thin crappy hair easily gets split ends and wanted good hair for a change... Hope this is helpful ladies.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  When traveling, I never have to worry about what the water is going to do to my hair when I have my Dualiste with me.  Love it!</li>
