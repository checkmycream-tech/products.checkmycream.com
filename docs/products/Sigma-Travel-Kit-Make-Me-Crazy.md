      <li>That&#x27;s pretty much the only con I can say, and that&#x27;s my own fault</li>

      <li>These brushes are pretty much all you need for makeup application (I don&#x27;t like the paddle foundation, prefer the F80), but everything else is spot on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I clean them before use, I wasn&#x27;t gentle with them at all and not a single hair fall out.</li>

    <li> I absolutely love the brushes!!! They are so soft and such great quality!!! They are the perfect size for traveling or just for an everyday make up if you don&#x27;t like big brushes.. I would highly recommend them!!! The best brushes I have ever own so far!</li>
    <li> I did alot of research on these brushes before I decided to purchase, and I must say I am extremely pleased with my decision.  I plan to do a lot of travelling this year and I&#x27;m pleased with the travel kit and quality. They are really soft and have a great design.  Overall like them and plan on purchasing more brushes from Sigma.</li>
    <li> This is a practical Travel Kit in my favourite colour. The design of the container and the quantity of brushes is enough to my usual journeys. Besides, all brushes are so soft. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll enjoy a lot making me up.</li>
    <li> These Sigma Beauty Brush Kit are the most perfect for applying all types of makeup form...Eyeshadows, blush, powder foundation and more! They come with a great travel case easy and quick when pressed for time to do a makeover.&lt;br /&gt;I will shop here again. I am a Happy return Customer.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, pdiddydoll</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Very nice brushes for the money.  Love that it came in a variety of colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> Bought for my girlfriend for her birthday (at her request, I wouldn&#x27;t have known to get her these)....She absolutely loves them and swears of Their quality</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why people give these brushes 5 stars. They are good but not the best. Some of them shed. For the price I am not happy about that. They quality of the brush is ok. I like the foundation brush a lot. That is my favorite. They are much better than any supermarket brushes. But there are better ones at department stores. They may cost a lot more at the department stores though.</li>
    <li> Will buy them again! They are just amazing love them much! The quality of these brushes is perfect for your face!!! Buy them!</li>
    <li> Hi every body ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really it&#x27;s a Good product and quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my sister and she loves it !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Like it so much ... They are really beautiful ... definitely I will ask again&lt;br /&gt;Like it so much ... They are really beautiful ... definitely I will ask again</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!  They&#x27;re made of a high quality material; don&#x27;t shed and very easy to clean.  A bonus I didn&#x27;t expect is that whichever product is put on each brush it stays on the brush and doesn&#x27;t fall onto my face (exams: shadow and powdered eyebrow color).  I thought these would be short; they&#x27;re not and I&#x27;ll probably buy another set as a spare before the price is increased.</li>
    <li> fabulous kit thank you soooooooo much</li>
    <li> Nice set , but the color is different</li>
    <li> Just received my Make me Crazy travel kit and it looks awesome! Cant wait to try all the brushes!&lt;br /&gt;The leather case it comes in looks very nice and is very useful for storage, traveling and is perfect to carry on your handbag!</li>
    <li> After buying this product, I didn&#x27;t have to buy extra brushes. It may say it&#x27;s a travel kit but I use it on a daily basis. Everyone&#x27;s preference is different but I don&#x27;t wear much makeup and sometimes none. Using these brushes gives me everything I need.</li>
    <li> Sigma Brushes worth all the hype that they get. If you could afford them, so why not?!</li>
    <li> أنا مرة أخرى لأكثر! انها لا تحصل على أفضل من ذلك. سأفعل، وسوف نكون سعداء لشرائها مرة أخرى.&lt;br /&gt;هل أقول أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة. يا &amp;#34;حسنا أنا لا أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة.</li>
    <li> Kind of confused as to why so many reviewers think a travel brush set would mean &amp;#34;fewer&amp;#34; brushes? When you travel, it&#x27;s not about how many brushes you take, it&#x27;s the size of the brushes that make a huge difference. I have way too many brushes, and it&#x27;s nice to have a set that is smaller--it fits so much better in my makeup case. These brushes are pretty much all you need for makeup application (I don&#x27;t like the paddle foundation, prefer the F80), but everything else is spot on.&lt;br /&gt;I have almost every Sigma brush out there. I&#x27;ve purchased the premium kit (way before it was ever over $200! I can&#x27;t believe they went up that much), the synthetic kabuki kit, and individual brushes&amp; I absolutely love them all. I have MAC brushes, and the quality is pretty much identical, sometimes better! Wash your brushes before you ever use them. My brushes don&#x27;t shed, and I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;abusing&amp;#34; these suckers for quite some time.</li>
    <li> I have been after Sigma brushes after I noticed all the YouTube beauty gurus using it, and one of them actually purchasing the $500 kit, I knew they must be to die for. So i asked for them for Christmas, except that my BF had a hard time finding them and were not to arrive for 6-8 weeks AKA not in time for Christmas. I was a little disappointed that he did not get them but he got me other goodies. And then...He saw them here, at Amazon!  So I received my brushes today and they were worth the wait. I immediately fell in love with how they feel, and tried the eye brushes for a trial Valentine&#x27;s Day look. I have washed them all as it is recommended by Sigma. I am already planning on getting the Sigmax collection, like next week. So excited that I am finally able to get my hands on them! oh, and the delivery was in only 5 days!!</li>
    <li> I was given these for Christmas from my husband. As a stay at home mom I don&#x27;t do my makeup every day so I didn&#x27;t get to use them right away. Unfortunately the moment I did use it the eye shadow brush (the one I  use most) is loose as if the casing is going to fall off the handle. I took pictures but for some reason it won&#x27;t let me post it. Of course all the others are fine but like I said this will be the most uses brush for me so it very frustrating. They are very soft which is nice but I&#x27;m going to have to see about getting a replacement. For almost $90 these should be in great working order for many years of use and not two or three uses.</li>
    <li> I liked it so much I bought a second set</li>
    <li> The brushes are so nice and soft. They are small travel size but durable. I clean them before use, I wasn&#x27;t gentle with them at all and not a single hair fall out. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After seeing countless videos on Youtube of beauty gurus talk about Sigma, I had to give them a try. I was extremely disappointed that these brushes shed the way they do. The best brush is the foundation brush, but that&#x27;s it. My ELF brushes are way better.</li>
    <li> When I read \\&quot;travel\\&quot; I thought oh they&#x27;re are just fewer brushes, I didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be smaller. I think the only smaller one is the powder brush, the rest just have smaller handles which isn&#x27;t a big deal. That&#x27;s pretty much the only con I can say, and that&#x27;s my own fault so just make sure you know before you purchase it, otherwise I&#x27;m in love (:</li>
    <li> I love itttt, it&#x27;s very small even smaller than it looks in the pic and it works for travelling and going out.</li>
