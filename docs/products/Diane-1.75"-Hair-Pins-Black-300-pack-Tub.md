      <li>These are wonderful, sturdy hair pins that keep my very long hair in place when securing buns and twists, more comfortable and practical than bobby pins in man instances, and they never ever pull out random strands of hair (unlike bobby pins, those things are VICIOUS).  </li>
      <li>They work better for me to pin them with the small opening than the other closed hair pins.</li>

    <li> These are wonderful, sturdy hair pins that keep my very long hair in place when securing buns and twists, more comfortable and practical than bobby pins in man instances, and they never ever pull out random strands of hair (unlike bobby pins, those things are VICIOUS).  I have hair to my bum, and often wear it up, so I can safely say I know what I&#x27;m talking about, I can also say I lose hair pins routinely (this is not the hair pins fault, I&#x27;m just messy) so the giant tub is a real winner----------------------------</li>
    <li> The black paint peels off after one use leaving silver pins. Other than that, they are as expected. The tub they come in is nice.</li>
    <li> The pins are to open they do not hold hair, they are made with cheat material. i do not recommend you buy these pins.</li>
    <li> I use these when I&#x27;m doing my hair in a large high bun. They really help keep everything in place.</li>
    <li> This product is very good, they didn&#x60;t cause pain in your head. My daughter use this a lot, and love it.</li>
    <li> No complaints here! They work great and as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the ones from Goody and had to return them because they were so flimsy and didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Repeat buyer of Diane hairpins. The go to hairpin!</li>
    <li> I thought it would have more inside. My female students say they are nice and don&#x27;t tangle.</li>
    <li> Good quality pins, they do exactly as intended.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with other types of pins and they are shoddy compared to these.&lt;br /&gt;Dianes has a very nice quality, they are sturdy and hold up well.</li>
    <li> Cheap, effective and as expected.  I don&#x27;t care if I lose one at this price and my hair is super secure.</li>
    <li> This is a big jar of black hair pins. They are pretty wide and strong. I use them to pin wigs and wig caps.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair, and even when it&#x27;s clean and slippery these still manage to keep everything in place. Makes up-do&#x27;s easy!</li>
    <li> my favorite hair pins!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Really great pins... But not the best for thin hair. If you have medium to thick stars, these are definitely a five star product!</li>
    <li> Very good for securing the bun.</li>
    <li> This was what I looking for because these Bobby pins are great for buns. I love my hair in a bun and I have plenty to last for some time. For a great buy they are great.</li>
    <li> The pins are wide open.  Not sure how they would stay in someone&#x27;s hair.  I returned this item.</li>
    <li> These great little hair pins are the perfect size to keep my bantu-knots in place while I sleep. They have very durable rubber tips, and come in a convenient plastic tub.</li>
    <li> The best hair pins, high quality, with a strong hold.</li>
    <li> These hair pins are perfect! I use them to hold my hair up when I make a bun, they do their job.</li>
    <li> I needed these for my Bantu Knots on my natural hair. They work better for me to pin them with the small opening than the other closed hair pins.</li>
    <li> As good as the ones found at walmart (goody I think is the brand name), but a whole lot cheaper. I felt like walmart had stolen money from me for all of these years!</li>
    <li> Perfect for updos or top knots. And there are so many it&#x27;s okay if they get lost (as most Bobbi pins do).</li>
    <li> I use these pins for all my buns, twist, updos and just about all styles that  need hair pins. I also use them on my 4yr daughters hair with no complaints from her. They are the perfect size and the value is great! 300 pins for just a little over 2$ you cant beat it. I will definatley order these again</li>
    <li> My daughter says these are better (stronger) than the ones you get at drug stores, and you get a lot of them!</li>
    <li> This is huge tub and the pins are great. I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t go through these too quickly. they&#x27;re good and hold my hair in place. I got them fairly quickly and have only lost a few in the past 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> The case was the best part. The hair pins were too flimsy. Even though I have thin hair, the pins still bend when I tried to use them. I&#x27;ve had much higher quality pins in the past, so I&#x27;m going to throw these pins away and keep the plastic case.</li>
    <li> Wore them a couple of times and the paint started peeling off the pins badly</li>
    <li> It arrived in great timing to a newly established APO. That&#x27;s and automatic win for me.</li>
    <li> The hair pins were exactly like described, however the packaging left much to be desired. It was shipped in an envelope that was crushed and therefore the plastic container was crushed and the pins were scattered around the envelope.</li>
    <li> Very low quality product. Does not hold hair well. Such a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Great hair pins! Perfect for securing buns, etc. Also came in a nice, secure container. Exactly as advertised, and pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> These pins work great. They feel loose, almost as if you don&#x27;t feel them at all, but they&#x27;ve very secure.</li>
