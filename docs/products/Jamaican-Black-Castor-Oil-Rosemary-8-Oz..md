<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great for natural hair!</li>
    <li> I love My Rosemary black castor oil. It Works great.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels so soft as soon as I put it in. I use argan oil&lt;br /&gt;conditioner with it, and it smells soo good.I will keep this on my shelf. I am not a product junkie.&lt;br /&gt;I just like to see what works for my long thick hair.I am making my own products and I will definitely put the castor oil&lt;br /&gt;mixed in it. I just like to have about 5 or 6 hair products around to use all the time in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;It works great as a hot oil treatment too. I use a bonnet and keep it on my head while I am out side .:)</li>
    <li> I bought this oil in hopes that it will help me to grow my hairs, particularly in receding hairline. So far, I have used this product twice a week as a mask for my hairline, where I think I need hairs to be grown. I did not spot any changes. However, I have been using his product to lengthen my lashes. It did wonders. I have very short eyelashes, but after using every night for 3 weeks i see the results. I attach photos.</li>
    <li> This has become one of my favorites...love it for my hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 18 month old daughter and I. We both have natural hair. This does wonders after washing our hair. It really softens the hair, promotes growth and seals in moisture. And to top it off it smells lovely!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to assist in eyebrow growth, but I hate the smell. I would suggest that if you purchase this product to only use it at night or when you don&#x27;t plan on going anywhere.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  I will definately purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> It is just too greasy for me, but that&#x27;s just me!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Used for a couple months without improved results~</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and works wonderfully</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. It is really thick. I use it at night before going to bed, making use to sleep with a bonnet (when my hair is in braids) and with a scarf when I&#x27;m wearing my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I am excited to use this product. They had it perfectly wrapped. It is thick and doesn&#x27;t stink like other reviews I have read.</li>
    <li> Love this product ! The smell is wonderful(Rosemary)even when i mix it with other oils it still holds true &amp; little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve only been using it for less than a month, so when i re-twist my locs&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll be able to tell if my hair has thickend. I feel that it has , because it&#x27;s more fizzy in my scalp than normal for me(Yeaaaaa!) .I will definatly buy this  product again.</li>
    <li> Hair falls out! I added this to my mix of&lt;br /&gt;Almonds oil&lt;br /&gt;Grapeseed oil&lt;br /&gt;Rosemary oil&lt;br /&gt;Vit E&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking to my regular oil mix jbco sucks!</li>
    <li> Great jbco! But I will stick to regular castro . This JBCO is a little too expensive .</li>
    <li> I ordered Black Jamaican Castor Oil with Rosemary, but received plain Black Jamaican Castor Oil. I&#x27;d done some research and found that both castor oil and rosemary are great for natural hair. I was really excited when I received the shipment, I tore open the package, broke the seal and that&#x27;s when I noticed it was the wrong item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon refunded the purchase price and provided a return shipping lable. Even so, it&#x27;s not only disappointing, but a hassle having to choose another vendor, re-order, wait again, and hope that I get the right product next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003XH7Q04 Jamaican Black Castor Oil Rosemary 8 Oz.]]</li>
    <li> I ordered it been hearing so many good things  arrived with a cracked top  so now I have to get creative on how to preserve the product. Will keep posted on results</li>
    <li> like this product for my natural hair transition.  keeps it soft and manageble.  will purchase more when this bottle expires!</li>
    <li> I am a 35 year old AA with natural hair. I have always had thin edges (since I was a child) and a really thin spot in the front part on top of my head . I have been applying the oil and massaging it every night for almost a week and I can not believe it BUT my edges are thickening! I have never had as much growth in these areas. This product is working for me. I must also add that I take Hair skin and nail pills and drink lots of water and doing these things together are thickening my edges.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for someone else, I did not use it.</li>
    <li> i use this daily.. Good stuff. I would def recommend this product.. the scent it has is not too strong.</li>
    <li> Thick, a bit smelly, and effective - when I was putting this on my eyelashes and eyebrows at night, they would be thick, lustrous and dark the next day. I mix with extra rosemary essential oil since I can&#x27;t handle the smell!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I use it in my daughters hair, and it works miracles for her dry scalp, only thing that works!!!! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> great product made my hair really soft..</li>
    <li> I have locs and have been using this brand. For a few months now. Absolutely luv the way it moisturizes. And thickens my locs :-)</li>
    <li> I was expecting this yesterday but got it today and love the smell and I put it on my scalp and it tingles so good. Already know now that I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I was very apprehensive at first about all the rave. I&#x27;m totally sold and will be purchasing this forever! Only downfall is that it&#x27;s not sold in any stores nearby. Jamaican Black Castor Oil is the best!</li>
    <li> This works good but to me it does not smell good at all. I know im going to order this again</li>
    <li> I have been using Jamaican Black Castor Oil for a while now and it is the best oil that I have ever used on my African American Natural Hair. However, this is even better. Google Rosemary and you will see why. Rosemary promotes healthy hair and will  stimulate your hair to grow.  This oil will help detangle hair and prevents it from drying out. I saw a difference it my hair immediately and my hair is in good condition. For all you Black women who have natural hair do &amp;#34;NOT&amp;#34; allow yourselves to be &amp;#34;sucked&amp;#34; in and become a hair junkie. Out of every $1.00 spent on Earth on hair care products, 68 cent of that dollar comes from black women. Practically every hair care product company has created a &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; of hair care products for black women that are wearing their hair natural. Ladies, keep your routine simply and your money in your pocket. Natural hair loves water. Purchase a good oil such as this (or whatever natural oil your hair prefers), a good conditioner (use silicone free 75 -80% of the time) and a sulfate free shampoo (use only as necessary as co-washing is better). Use your fingers as a comb as much as possible and manipulate your hair as little as possible. Do not try to make your hair do anything allow your hair to be. Naturally. Remember there is NO SUCH THING AS &amp;#34;BAD&amp;#34; HAIR 1</li>
    <li> I ordered Jamaican Black Castor Oil with Rosemary, but I received the plain Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  The plain oil is useless to me due to the strong smell. -Unfortunately...no stars.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! It has a nicer smell then original castor oil. And this product did wonders with helping my hair grow thicker and stronger!</li>
    <li> Great product. The Rosemary really cuts the castor oil smell. This comes in a heavy glass bottle. This makes me nervous about dropping it, but that&#x27;s the only negative I can think of. Great big size.</li>
    <li> Has kind of a funky smell, and is thick and a little sticky.  Most people buy it for use on their hair, but it was recommended to me for varicose veins.  I don&#x27;t know yet if it is helping with that.</li>
    <li> Excellent1  Everything I hoped it would be for fighting dryness in my hair.</li>
    <li> At first I got the wrong item (just regular JBCO instead) but I figured it would do the same job so I didn&#x27;t plan on making a big deal of it. I&#x27;d just keep it. I heard from the company shortly after and they reshipped me what I ordered for free and let me keep the regular JBCO too! What a fantastic seller! Also the oil is phenomenal, I can see a difference in my eyelashes already and it&#x27;s only been a week!</li>
    <li> Though I prefer the coconut I&#x27;m a big fan of Jamaican black castor oil period.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this product so far. The smell is wonderful and it really moisturizes my hair. I will be using the product for a while to see if it helps to thicken my hair. But so far so good. The item was shipped very quickly so I will order from the seller again for sure.</li>
    <li> Great Product! I love the combination of Black Castor Oil along with Rosemary. It definitely promotes hair growth. Thank You!</li>
