      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>Gardenia has become my favorite scent because of this.  </li>
      <li>From Kai&#x27;s own website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to get this for my mother after using the Kai oil myself purchased from a store.  </li>
      <li>Sweet and kind of sultry and island-y.  </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the real thing.</li>
      <li>I originally found this fragrance in a boutique and purchased for way more than I found it on amazon.</li>
      <li>The aroma it&#x27;s amazing, very clean smell and its absorbs fast</li>
      <li>Moral of the story is you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy.</li>

      <li>It smells so good, very feminine and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I have found my new favorite perfume!</li>

      <li>I actually smile after I put it on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so feminine with the fresh floral notes of gardenia and jasmine, but not overpowering or too \\&quot;mature\\&quot; smelling.</li>
      <li>it is fresh and natural.&lt;br /&gt;Not too power or overbearing.  </li>
      <li>Most of all not over-powering and old lady-like.  </li>
      <li>It reminds me of many &amp;#34;single note&amp;#34; fragrances, but still it smells clean just a bit different.  </li>
      <li>Good for layering with other Kai products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A friend asked if she coukld use my PC to order this and specified when she ordered it that it MUST arrive by a certain date since she was going to MO to visit a friend.  It came late so I told the company I had to return both this (and the body lotion she ordered at the same time).  They sent me an email telling me to KEEP BOTH as a GIFT.  Now that&#x27;s a nice company and I LOVE both.  It smells so good you get heads turning when you pass close by someone!  It&#x27;s a very soft fragrence, not too stromg so you can spray a lot and never smell overpowering!  My friend DID order her own once she returned from her trip and I told her how the company was so nice they gave both items to me as a GIFT.  She gave the company rave reviews on her Facebook page!.</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of gardenia, you will love this perfume. However, this scent is very subtle yet sensual. I wear it all year round  and always get questions about it. What is that scent?   Naomi</li>
    <li> Just couldn&#x27;t wait to get my Kai as I always have loved it when tried on in a store.  I was delighted when I sprayed it on, but was very disappointed to realize that the lovely fragrance barely lasts til you reach the door of the house.  Too bad, I won&#x27;t buy it again for this reason.</li>
    <li> Bought this parfum for my daughter and this is her third bottle.  She absolutely loves it and gets so many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I love this Kai perfume!  It smells so good and I have bought the perfume and the oil now.  They are both great.  I would recommend this to anyone, it is amazing!  The seller was really helpful when the post office sent the package to the wrong location.  They tracked it down and got everything back on track.  I would definitely order this perfume from this seller every time!</li>
    <li> It was love at first sniff. (haha) I&#x27;ve only fallen head over heels for two perfumes in my whole life. One was in Germany and they don&#x27;t make it anymore. This is number two. I feel like I got a second chance. I actually smile after I put it on. I think it&#x27;s light (no complaints from officemate yet) and just takes me back to sitting in a patio with fragrant flowers all around me.</li>
    <li> i GET A COMPLIMENT EVERY TIME SOMEBODY WALKS BY ME.  bUY THIS AND THE lotion.</li>
    <li> bought kai from this site found out they were not a authentic kai retailer, got perfume, box was open, not shrink wrapped bottle nozzle was wet, and perfume was not filled up. learned my lesson, now go to kai&#x27;s website for authorized dealers....you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> LOVE it. Lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> The actual Kai scent is beautiful - This is not an authentic product and smells nothing like the Kai - it&#x27;s actually quite awful. I threw three bottles in the bin!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this supplier.&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra $20 and buy the actual perfume - it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, this is my third purchase of Kai. Compliments are abundant every time I wear this scent. Clean, floral, soft. Shipment from this seller was prompt and the item was packaged well.</li>
    <li> What lovely, careful packaging! Received the product exactly as described and much earlier than expected. This is a great seller from whom I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  It is has a light, clean fragrance that is subtle and not over-powering.  The best compliment comes from our four year-old who told me one day \\&quot;I knew you were coming because I could smell the beautiful air!\\&quot;  It is expensive, but worth the cost -- I also recommend the Kai body wash.  It too is a bit pricey, but it helps me start each day with a smile - that&#x27;s priceless.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of &#x27;kai&#x27; before and I am so glad I received it as a birthday gift...I am hooked.  It smells so good, very feminine and fresh.  Most of all not over-powering and old lady-like.  I got the lotion and the scent lasts for a couple hours, I&#x27;m even wearing it right now.</li>
    <li> I am a Kai user for many years... and this product smelled teriible.. definitely not Kai. I contacted seller who was reude and unresponsive... definitely will never order form them again.</li>
    <li> My husband originally bought this fragrance for me in Hawaii and it was very expensive. I later found in on Amazon for a more reasonable price. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a very good item I look to purchase more of this brand of product.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right.</li>
    <li> I just bought this recently and it is DEFINITELY not the Kai I usually buy from Lucky Scent. I have been wearing this perfume for years and I know that it isn&#x27;t the same. It also doesn&#x27;t last for more than an hour. I bought from this seller because it was much cheaper...now I know why! Hard lesson learned...</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful fresh floral scent with a hint of spicy undertones to it.  It makes one think of a tropical paradise -- very evocative.  I think it&#x27;s a 5 star scent, but I was disappointed at how quickly it faded on me (thus, 4 stars).</li>
    <li> I love Kai products, and wish they came in larger sizes!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to family and friends or just anyone!</li>
    <li> The parfum is old.  I have been  purchasing from Hemline and the parfum in the bottle is very yellow.  The parfum in the 5 bottles I purchased from AMAZON are almost clear.  About 2 years ago the color changed.  So I know the 5 bottles are old.  Not very happy.  Moral of the story is you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy.</li>
    <li> Only 4 stars because the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as the little roll on bottle, but it is a lovely spray.  Good for layering with other Kai products.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I looked everywhere to find my fav fragrance at a good price and found it on Amazon. Great price &amp; arrived NIB, &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Thx for the great deal. Now I&#x27;m a happy lifetime customer for Kai!</li>
    <li> I love all things Kai and use everything in this line. Gardenia has become my favorite scent because of this.  However this gave me instant headache and will not be using it again. Would send back if it weren&#x27;t so much trouble.</li>
    <li> Expensive... But smells so pretty. :)</li>
    <li> Mom requested this. I bought and she loves it! I even enjoyed this perfume. Most perfumes cause me to have allergic reaction, but this did not. Gaye straza did nice job. Thanks amazon for carrying rt his.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! and so does my husband.  It takes us both back to Hawaii!  The bottle I received was fresh, new and promptly delivered. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I believe it is a fake knock off / imitation. I&#x27;d like to return it. doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the real thing.</li>
    <li> It is the traditional Hawaiian scent. I get stopped every time I&#x27;m wearing it by men and women asking me what I&#x27;m wearing. A great gift. Smells lovely on all my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> I love Kai!  Their products are amazing, the quality is fantastic.  I use everything from the foaming sponge in the shower to the body lotion to the body oil to the perfume.  It is so light and fresh, it is never overwhelming.  I always get compliments and I can&#x27;t imagine wearing anything heavier or more pungent.  Kai is a delightful product!</li>
    <li> Sweet and kind of sultry and island-y.  I first bought the spray light oil and it was so delicious that I had to get the perfume.</li>
    <li> I love Kai perfume. It&#x27;s so feminine with the fresh floral notes of gardenia and jasmine, but not overpowering or too \\&quot;mature\\&quot; smelling. It&#x27;s a fun fragrance that I will be sporting all summer long. :)</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of Kai from them and it is not the real scent.  When I tried to return it, the company was very UNHELPFUL and wasted my time.  I would never buy anything from them.</li>
    <li> Love this! Fast service!</li>
    <li> From Kai&#x27;s own website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to get this for my mother after using the Kai oil myself purchased from a store.  However, I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews.  I did a little more research and I found this on Kai&#x27;s own website [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;kai fragrance does not sell directly from this site. to find a store near you or an online retailer use the listing below. we recommend contacting the store prior to shopping to make sure they carry the kai product you&#x27;re looking for. kai does not endorse any unauthorized retailer sales through amazon nor do we endorse any sales through ebay whatsoever or guarantee the authenticity of discounted kai products.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On their website you can search for a local brick and mortar retailer in your area.  I would have felt really bad if I had bought my mother something that was not what she or I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Discovered this in sample.  Seriously lost my mind with this fragrance as I use the bubble bath product for washing delicates. Have the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  I have bottle out on counter.  Every so often, as a walk by it, I pick it up.. give it a spritz.  If you didn&#x27;t believe in aroma therapy changing your mood, then you haven&#x27;t try this fragrance.  It&#x27;s not about transporting me to some exotic island; it&#x27;s more about a &amp;#34;feel good,&amp;#34;  Please DO NOT DISCONTINUE.  THINK ABOUT PUTTING OUT LINGERIE AND SOFTERNER FOR DELICATES.  OOOH! DRAWING LINING AND SACHETS FOR DRAWS AND HANGERS.</li>
    <li> I love the soft, faint scent of Kai...Reminds me of fragrances from my past...White Shoulders, for example.  I have found my new favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> Love this smell - it is fresh and natural.&lt;br /&gt;Not too power or overbearing.  It is the perfect summer smell. I love Kai</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best purfumes I own. It smells like summer. It&#x27;s fresh, clean and soft all at once.. I own their lotion and pre-bath sponge shower scrub as well and I love it. I have people walk up to me and say \\&quot; you smell soooo good\\&quot;... Thank you.</li>
    <li> Light, fresh fragrance.  I mix this with my lotion to make it last.  I wear it everyday - it&#x27;s a fresh, subtle scent.</li>
    <li> The smell is a lovely floral smell that just stays on all day. I would however recommend the Kai pure oil. It&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume and she always asks for it. Since she has been wearing it for several years, I think it&#x27;s safe to say that it gets a 5 in her book. I&#x27;m happy to be able to give her something she really wants.</li>
    <li> Bought this for both of my step-daughters.  They both loved it!  Not surprised since they both specifically requested it for X-mas.</li>
    <li> I originally found this fragrance in a boutique and purchased for way more than I found it on amazon. I love the smell and I receive so many compliments and people ask what it is. I hesitate to share, I like to be unique especially with fragrances. Kai is an awesome perfume to wear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kai perfume for years, yet didn&#x27;t realize that this bottle purchased from Amazon was a COPY.  It smells awful.  How do I exchange it for the real thing or get my money back?!</li>
    <li> I like the floral smell but it is not like the way I remember it when I bought it at a retail store. my coworker loves the smell when I wear it.  I kind of like it but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> Kai is one of the few perfumes that does not spell artificial to me.  It reminds me of Hawaii after a gentle rain.</li>
    <li> My daughters favorite parfume.  Always a hit for birthdays and Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!!! Exactly what I ordered :) Get compliments everyday on it, beautiful scent, fresh and lively, always am asked what I am wearing.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing.  Beware.!! you will attract men.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  Smells just like Hawaii!</li>
    <li> Fragrance takes me right back to hawaii. I love it. Helped me get through a dreary winter.i was soo glad to find it.</li>
    <li> Found this scent in Hawaii, fell in love with its soft unique fragrance. Arrived on time and in brand new condition. Really pleased with this purchase and will definitely purchase it again. It&#x27;s addicting!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it from this seller, America&#x27;s Beauty Supply,  is not the real thing, it smells terrible and not even the fluid color is the same ! The others reviewers were right but I was&#x27;t wise enough to listen !</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  PERFECTLY PACKAGED…Exactly what i ordered.  After seeing/smelling this perfume in Honolulu, I knew I had to have it!</li>
    <li> The aroma it&#x27;s amazing, very clean smell and its absorbs fast</li>
    <li> I thought I would have smelled more tropic notes but this perfume is okay.  I thought I would enjoy it based on the feedback from others that made this so positive but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> love kai, but i still feel like the oil is stronger and lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;i will use this up, but will keep using the oil.</li>
    <li> item arrived in good shape and was as advertised.</li>
    <li> I had read so much about this fragrance that I had to try it.  Everything was true.  It&#x27;s unique enough for  a reasonable price.  It reminds me of many &amp;#34;single note&amp;#34; fragrances, but still it smells clean just a bit different.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> love the fragrance and its worlds better than the body oil&lt;br /&gt;that they sell.  The oil doesnt last but this one defo does</li>
