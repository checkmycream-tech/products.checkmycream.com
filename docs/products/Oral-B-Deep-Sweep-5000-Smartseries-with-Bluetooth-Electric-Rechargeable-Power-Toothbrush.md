      <li>Oral-B Pro 5000 Bluetooth Toothbrush is very nice with an aggressive brushing style.</li>
      <li>;, I can see why Oral-B tried to integrate Bluetooth into this model, but I think it&#x27;s a perfect fine toothbrush without those bells and whistles!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping this model will prove to be as good.</li>
      <li>The in-app timer helps you visualize this, and it is surprisingly motivating compared to the brush pulses.</li>

    <li> Seems like everything has Bluetooth capabilities these days from my speakers, car starter, even my Samsung front-load washer and dryer are Bluetooth enabled (really helps multitasking), but WHO ever thought a toothbrush would need to be Bluetooth enabled is either a pure genius or an even more clever hacker.  When my Oral-B Deep Sweep 5000 (DS-5000) arrived, I was quite excited to try out a new gadget to show off to my eye-rolling lady but what I ended up getting was a near-security breach disguised as a really nice toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, you can easily purchase a really nice electric toothbrush for under triple digits so the only real reason for spending over that for the DS-5000 is it&#x27;s BT capabilities and, after rooting around with it for a week, I can safely say that it&#x27;s not worth it.  The app was the first thing I attempted to putz with before operating the actual toothbrush and when the app requested numerous permissions of which I was not comfortable with such as access to my SD card and calendar.  To me, this is a severe intrusion as even my BT enabled home theater and car stereo do not require that information.  This puts the user at an extreme risk of being hacked and, while unlikely, identity theft is the largest growing crime in the world and I don&#x27;t want to be part of the statistic.  I strongly urge Oral-B to redesign what the app needs before unleashing such an open Trojan Horse even if their intentions were noble, which I believe they were.  It&#x27;s just too high a risk and does NOT improve the overall experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the app just allowed one to view what the sensors were reading WITHOUT needing access to my personal information, I would be OK with it otherwise it has NO business accessing my network or anything other than BT settings on my phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as to the toothbrush itself, the DS-5000 is a solid machine that gets the job done as well as any other electrical toothbrush.  The triple bristles are very handy in getting gunk and other crap out of my teeth after meal and the motor seems strong enough to get the job done consistently over time.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good toothbrush... but that app... can&#x27;t get it out of my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I&#x27;m fixated on the app as it really bugs me.  I&#x27;d love to use the sensors to determine how to improve what I&#x27;m doing but I really can&#x27;t stand it&#x27;s seemingly intrusive nature and, no, I won&#x27;t shut off whole features in my phone settings every time I run the app, that&#x27;s stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the DS-5000 could&#x27;ve been a REALLY good toothbrush if the app wasn&#x27;t so intrusive.  You can get a similar toothbrush for less that doesn&#x27;t invade your privacy.tting gunk and other crap out of my teeth after meal and the motor seems strong enough to get the job done consistently over time.

    <li> I have never used an electric toothbrush before and this brush does provide a near dentist quality cleaning.    Four or five stars for the brush.  One or zero for the app.    The brush has six modes:  daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, massage and tongue cleaning, but it is almost impossible to tell which mode the brush is in.    I think the app is pretty close to worthless for me.  It keeps track of which day you brushed in the last month and gives you statistics such as how many consecutive days you have brushed, flossed, etc.  It also displays news, weather and pictures from around the world while you are brushing.  If you spend 18 hours a day on Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, etc,  I guess you may think the app is fun, but it&#x27;s not my cup of tea.  You can send all your brushing statistics to your dentist.  The app displays a list of about 30 dentists within four miles of where I live.  I am not sure if this is a list of all the dentists that have volunteered and signed up for this. I hate to sound too harsh, but I don&#x27;t think my dentist wants to keep up to the minute tabs on my brushing.    The app has a timer mode that splits the recommended two minutes brushing into four 30 second sessions for the four quadrants or &#x27;Focused Care Zones&#x27;.  I just  learned about the &#x27;Display 3D Teeth&#x27; setting and that shows a pretty neat visual.  After you stop brushing and also stop the timer on the app it reminds you to clean you tongue, floss and rinse. It uses the honor system for the daily, weekly and monthly statistics that keep track of all that. Since it&#x27;s the honor system, it may not match reality.  In fact once as a test I started the timer on the app without turning on the brush and it gave me credit for brushing.  There are statistics such as how many seconds you used &#x27;too much pressure&#x27;, but for some reason that is only displayed on the monthly statistics, but not the daily or weekly.    The directions say the bush comes uncharged and may take a full 24 hoursfor the initial charge. Mine did require the full 24 hours.  The package came with only one brush head. I see other  Oral-B models that come with quite a few brush heads.    Oral-B has a model with a Smart Guide device which has a timer, time of day display and a smiley vs frown if you brush with too much pressure.  I think that model would provide enough information for me.</li>
    <li> I am loving the Oral B deep sweep 5000 toothbrush. It truly gives a &amp;#34;just from the dentist&amp;#34; feel.&lt;br /&gt;There are various modes but you don&#x27;t really know what mode you are on unless you are connected to the app. The first mode is particularly strong. I could feel the vibrations into my nose.  It is easy to switch between modes with just a press of a button.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is impressive. It took about 12 hours or so for mine to fully charge. A week later I still haven&#x27;t had to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush will store your results for when you have your phone next to it. You do not have to have the app open everytime you use the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I have an iPhone and the app was easy to find and easy to start using. I was able to turn off location, microphone, notifications and cell data.&lt;br /&gt;Really the only thing I would find the app useful for is to keep track of my kids brushing habits but I think the powerfulness of this brush would turn them off of brushing so I haven&#x27;t told them to try yet.</li>
    <li> Let me open by saying I received this product through Amazon&#x27;s Vine Program and I&#x27;ve been a long time user of other Oral-B products.  Having said that this is a nice product and an interesting change in direction by Oral-B.  I&#x27;m not 100% sure on the need for an app  or a bluetooth connection for a toothbrush it could be because I recognize that it wouldn&#x27;t make a significant impact on my habits (sorry, dentist and general feeling seem to do pretty well; I don&#x27;t need an app for everything in my life). As for the brushing experience, mixed.  I honestly prefer my older Oral-B toothbrush with circular motion vs. the traditional brush style of this model.  There are some interesting features on this; indication if you&#x27;re pressing to hard for example, but for me I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worthy of replacing an existing Oral-B product unless it needs replacing.  Call this one 4 stars because I do believe it&#x27;s better than many toothbrushes out there.</li>
    <li> We use almost exclusively electric toothbrushes at my house nowadays, but until now they have all been the Sonicare brand. The Oral-B Deep Sweep 5000 has a weird concept, but it performs very well and has a few distinct advantages. Other reviewers have discussed using the Bluetooth features, so I&#x27;ll just go over a few points I haven&#x27;t seen addressed much yet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The Deep Sweep 5000 is very comparable to the Sonicare Diamond Clean, which is much more expensive both for the initial unit and for refills (you can only use the Diamond Clean heads on the unit, and they currently sell for $11-$15 each). I LOVE that you can use any Oral B electric toothbrush refill head for the Deep Sweep; that is awesome. It will allow me to get a refill for as little as $6-$7. SO much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I do caregiving for an elderly client, and this is a great potential brush for the disabled or those with special needs. The brush will pause if you push too hard against your teeth, and the tracking feature is great for making sure someone is getting all the care they really need. There&#x27;s a sensitive setting, and everything about this brush is ideal for those who may struggle with harsher electric brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good. I will post with updates about long-term battery life issues or quality (my DiamondClean died after two years and has resisted all attempts at resurrection). For now, recommended and rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE: A</li>
    <li> This is very similar to the Oral-B Precision Black 7000 that I was using previously and that my hubby now uses (and he tells me I better not ask for it back; lol).  It comes with a fancy case and a stand with a brush head compartment that doesn&#x27;t have to be used (I don&#x27;t use it to save space, plus I&#x27;m the only one using the brush). I first completely charged the toothbrush before using it, and it took a full 24 hours before the blue charging light stopped flashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This only came with one deep sweep brush head, which is shaped differently and goes side to side instead of around in circles.  The brush head is made to get in between your teeth better than the smaller circular brush. It is supposed to remove more plaque; that I don&#x27;t know, but my teeth do feel \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; after using it. Other Oral-B brushes also fit, so when the original brush is used up I will be using the replacement brushes that I already had for the last model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bluetooth smartphone program I think is a gimmick that might be ok for kids to get them to brush longer and make sure they get that smiley face for brushing 2 minutes.  :-)  I had downloaded the program on my smartphone before receiving the brush (it&#x27;s at google play store).  But the thing is, you have to put your phone by where you&#x27;re brushing, turn on the Oral-B app and usually I ended up getting the phone wet clicking on the app and when it asked me if I had flossed and rinsed (you have to click to go further). At the end of 30 seconds the brush pulses telling you to go on to the next area.  It also has a pressure sensor that flashes a red light if you&#x27;re brushing too hard. After using the app a few times I got tired of it and quit; a couple days later I got a notice I hadn&#x27;t used the app so I ended up turning off bluetooth on the phone.  Now I really appreciate the smartguide that came with the Oral-B Precision Black 7000; it&#x27;s a little clock that you can stick on the mirror and shows the same things that the Oral-B app on your phone shows; what mode you&#x27;re in (Daily Clean, Gum Care, Sensitive, Whitening, and Deep Clean) and how long you&#x27;re brushing in each quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the Oral-B smartphone app a 3 and the brush itself a 5.-B app on your phone shows; what mode you&#x27;re in (Daily Clean, Gum Care, Sensitive, Whitening, and Deep Clean) and how long you&#x27;re brushing in each quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the Oral-B smartphone app a 3 and the brush itself a 5.</li>
    <li> I personally found all this high-tech dental care to be a tedious.  This set up is heavier than my Sonicare unit.  It includes a travel case.  I just found it more trouble than it was worth.  It does clean well.  I would like to find a less expensive unit without Bluetooth.  I see no need to add that expense.  The set up of the app was not difficult but I just don&#x27;t need that much information on tooth brushing.  People who love gadgets and are highly tech-minded would probably love this.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:8e8521ba337081447e6471c2bc58c61e]]When I decided to replace our six-year-old Oral-B toothbrushes, I opted for the Bluetooth version of Oral-B&#x27;s Deep Sweep 5000 toothbrush, and my wife chose the [[ASIN:B00ARTK95A Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep with Smart Guide Triaction 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, 1 Count]]. A pleasant surprise: Despite the fact that the Bluetooth version does not include Oral-B&#x27;s SmartGuide device--the little display that communicates with the toothbrush--it will work with the SmartGuide that comes with the non-Bluetooth version.    That&#x27;s nice, because it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to start up your phone, enter your password, find the Oral-B application, and start it up, just to brush your teeth. Most of the time, I simply use the SmartGuide (or rely on the built-in vibration and lights alerts). On the other hand, I prefer to travel light, so I don&#x27;t want to pack the SmartGuide every time I leave town, even if the new SmartGuide is smaller than the previous version (see pics). In those cases, it&#x27;s nice to have the application available. In case you were wondering, the new toothbrushes won&#x27;t work with the old SmartGuide, and you can&#x27;t buy a SmartGuide by itself.    The app is very well done; in addition to brushing-related information, you can browse the news while brushing. And, the communication between the toothbrush and my iPhone 6 was totally trouble-free--once I&#x27;d set it up, I didn&#x27;t have to think about it at all. I don&#x27;t, for example, have to turn on anything on the toothbrush or on my phone (other than having Bluetooth active on the phone).    However, I think the Bluetooth radio does have an effect on battery life. The first full charge gave me eight days of brushing (two minutes twice a day on most days, plus a couple extra on weekends). When our six-year-old Oral-B brushes were new, they held out for about two weeks, and even now they still give us about four days of brushing on a full charge. I haven&#x27;t been able to test thenew toothbrushes side by side yet (sorry; I just thought about it yesterday). At least the charger is a bit more convenient than the older version; the old version had a very large, awkward wall plug (see pic).  Otherwise, the toothbrush is roughly the same size, and makes about the same amount of noise, which isn&#x27;t objectionable. The new toothbrush has lights that flash after every 30 seconds and at 2 minutes; it&#x27;s not that easy to see the lights, but combined with the vibration alerts (and the SmartGuide, if you&#x27;re using it), it&#x27;s plenty to know your progress. I can&#x27;t really tell any difference in brushing quality between the old Triumph and the new one; they seem about the same to me.    Comparisons aside, it is an excellent toothbrush (which is why I replaced an old Oral-B with a new Oral-B). My only criticism would be about the battery life, and even there, it&#x27;s still pretty good. Perhaps the next version will brush my teeth for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush system for a month now. I had been curious about these new electric toothbrushes for awhile now, and happily accepted one to try out. First off, I&#x27;m someone who is fairly serious about taking care of their teeth. I usually brush them three times daily, floss, uses mouthwash, and goes to the dentist on a regular basis. But I&#x27;ve always used a regular manual toothbrush. I can vaguely remember my family getting an electric toothbrush for Christmas back when I was a child (about forty years or so ago), but I can&#x27;t say I recall ever using it. My current prefer band of toothbrushes are the [[ASIN:B008I2ILDK Oral-B complete Deep Clean]] ones. I tend to purchase the extra value packs with four toothbrushes as I usually retire one after four or five weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the review of this new electric one. Right out of the box I encountered a problem. I&#x27;ve got a variety of android tablets and apple devices, but none of them are equipped with bluetooth 4.0, so while I could download the Oral-B app - I could not pair it to anything I owned. I ended up borrowing a friend&#x27;s newer ipad mini for a  few days just so I could check the app out with the toothbrush. You can still make use of the app on a non-paired device, but just for the timer function. The app is OK, but not really that useful for me. I could see it being more useful for someone that hasn&#x27;t developed a habit of spending at least three minutes brushing their teeth. I already have that habit so really didn&#x27;t make use of the app at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself was something new for me to experience, like I mentioned I&#x27;ve never really used one of these. There was a lot to get use to. There are five different modes of brushing, which you cycle through with a button on the handle. I have to say I&#x27;ve tried all five and after the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush I can&#x27;t say which I prefer. There are also lights that light up while you&#x27;re brushing - a red light that indicates you&#x27;re applying too much pressure and a green which is to indicate time to move on to the next area of your teeth (or at least that is what I think the green light is for). At first I got a lot of red lights, and still do (just not as much). I seem to be having a hard time remembering that this is an electric toothbrush and letting the device do the work. But I am getting better at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush comes with a charging base - which in the picture looks to be pretty large. But it&#x27;s actually a small button of a thing. The photo shows the spare brush head storage box that you get and can be attached to the charger. Personally, I am keeping the toothbrush in the travel case and storing it in a cabinet drawer and only put it on the charger when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush comes with one brush head and there are a number of different models that you can buy. I&#x27;m going to purchase a few of the others to tryout and see if I like them better. Pricing the brush heads at the local store (and here on Amazon) I see these things aren&#x27;t cheap. I&#x27;m also a bit concerned with how long one lasts before needing replaced. With my manual toothbrushes I could afford to go through them on a pretty regular basis, not so sure about these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I was glad I got the chance to try one of these out and I feel that it did do a pretty good job at keeping my teeth clean. But I sort of expect that at some point I will be returning to my old hand-powered toothbrush.t indicates you&#x27;re applying too much pressure and a green which is to indicate time to move on to the next area of your teeth (or at least that is what I think the green light is for).

    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I am excited to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assembly was simple.  You assemble the charging base by snapping the charging pod into the holder.  Then you place the included ring around the neck of the toothbrush head and then snap the head onto the toothbrush handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging takes 24 hours according to the manual, so I will update this review once I brush my teeth with it.  At the time of this writing, the toothbrush is charging.  One complete charge will last ten days and you can keep it charged up all the time by resting it in the base.  According to the manual, you cannot overcharge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The particular toothbrush comes with Bluetooth connectivity that it can talk to an app that reports on your brushing habits.  While I think this information gathering may be useful, I probably won;t use it all that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have brushed my teeth twice with this toothbrush.  It definitely feels like I just came from the dentist after using it.  By this, I mean my teeth feel clean.  My gums do not hurt from using it. The brush is a little louder than I expected.  It will also take some getting used to, because if you pull the toothbrush out of your mouth while it is running, toothpaste flies everywhere.  This, is to be expected.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:a30bb53774352adb660723d8c9f21bef]] As if anyone couldn&#x27;t have come up with that one....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...you can say that too, \\&quot;My toothbrush has bluetooth!!\\&quot; and they&#x27;ll ask \\&quot;Why?! Why would you need one... I&#x27;m fine with my $1 toothbrush, thank you.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a very tech-filled world today, it seems like everything has to have Bluetooth nowadays... especially with smartphones, and syncing up to everything via Bluetooth... now even toothbrushes?! It seems silly and you&#x27;ll probably ask yourself why and for what too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, being a major gadget geek myself, having this Bluetooth feature has made brushing my teeth more fun! I can just imagine the possibility of adding some sort of mini-game while using the toothbrush/smartphone  (come on Oral-B or talented developers! or how about sharing your stats to your friends on Facebook about your brushing habits like achieving 30 straight brushing days! haha just kidding, that&#x27;s a horrible idea... seeing post updates about brushing teeth... that would be annoying... or when they no longer see those updates, your friends find out when you don&#x27;t brush your teeth... haha eewww... they don&#x27;t need to know everything!! Let&#x27;s just keep it for place when we know someone gets married, have a baby and cat pictures...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take full advantage, you need a smartphone and download their Oral-B app. Once you have that, when the app is open and you remove the toothbrush from the charger, it&#x27;ll automatically sync together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B/dentists recommends doing at least 2-minute sessions of brushing your teeth (I had no idea it was that short... I usually used to brush way longer!) - you get a nice timer increments in a circular quadrant; every 30 seconds, the tooth brush will light up green and vibrate differently to let you know to switch to a different section of your teeth - I take it it&#x27;s 30 seconds for each area of your teeth (upper right, lower right, lower left, upper left - just like how you see the timer) for a total of 2 minutes. When you press the power button, it&#x27;ll automatically start the timer, which is nice. If you end up pressing the power off button within 2 minutes, it&#x27;ll stop the clock and ask to continue before it resets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the bluetooth feature is to keep track of your brushing habits and give you encouragements (you get a smiley face when you have a great session!! YAY!! but where&#x27;s my golden star?!?). The app also shows some random facts and sometimes your own photo gallery from your phone shows up (which I didn&#x27;t want to pop up in my face while I was brushing my teeth!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get 5 modes: Daily Clean, Gum Care, Sensitive, Whitening and Deep Clean.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have the app, it will be hard to tell what mode you&#x27;re on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also stores up to 20 sessions in case you didn&#x27;t have time or too lazy to open the app before brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, it took over a full day for it to fully charge and stop flashing (when it&#x27;s fully charged, it won&#x27;t be flashing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously been using the cheaper Oral-B 1000 model, and I can say my teeth feels more refreshed, like that feeling you get when you get a cleanup done at the dentist, with this Oral-B 5000. It has some nice blue glow and backside also flashes red if you&#x27;re brushing too hard. The lights aren&#x27;t really necessary for me, since I already know when I&#x27;m brushing too hard, even with my old 1000 model, because you can tell just by the motor sound slowing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a major gadget geek, I mounted a phone cradle on my mirror and stuck a NFC (Near Field Communication) tag on it so that it&#x27;ll open the Oral-B app automatically when I place it on the base; it also makes it easier to see while I&#x27;m brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a gadget freak and want more excitement when the time comes to brushing your teeth, be organized, gain some encouragements, then having bluetooth on your toothbrush might be your answer. For me, getting this not only has made my teeth feel really refreshed after each session, but it has also made it fun and taught me the proper time to brush my teeth every time.as also made it fun and taught me the proper time to brush my teeth every time.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Oral-B Deep Sweep 5000 electric toothbrush. It came with a Procter &amp; Gamble Oral-B coupon which offered $10 in total savings when you register at oralb dot com website. The coupon said I would receive $3 off replacement brush heads instantly and an additional $7 off coupon when I registered my new brush. After I entered my personal info at the registration page and submitted it, the next page said: The promotion had expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The expiration date on the coupon is 7/31/2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Procter &amp; Gamble/Oral-B&#x27;s not honoring the $7 off offer is irresponsible. Waiting until AFTER I submitted my personal information to inform me is deceptive. I never expected this from Procter &amp; Gamble.</li>
    <li> Overall operation good, but the battery life is not close to what is advsertized.</li>
    <li> The whole Bluetooth on a toothbrush seems gimmicky and far above and beyond what anyone would actually want. I surmise that no one, prior to seeing this product, would think &#x27;wow, I wish I could sync my brushing history with my computer&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the actual toothbrush hardware is great and makes a meaningful better clean vs. manually brushing.</li>
    <li> I am generally very pleased with this product. It has several brushing modes and cleans my teeth thoroughly in a few minutes. You can use it for several days after taking it off the charger, so when traveling if it&#x27;s only for a couple of days you just need to take the brush in the case provided. The head that came with the brush lasted a few months, so I think that from that perspective, the quality is good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not too crazy about the whole idea of using the brush with the app for iphone or ipad. I downloaded the app and tried it out and it was OK, but after a few weeks it really gets tiresome and there is not a great benefit from using it with the app. Do you really need to get an achievement for cleaning your tongue for a certain numbers of days without fail? I don&#x27;t think so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I would like the brush to have without using the app is a way for me to know which brushing mode I am using. Of course, after a few uses you can memorize the order and figure it out that way. But having something on the handle that indicates whether you are using deep cleaning, or normal mode, etc. seems to me like not too much to ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those minor gripes apart, this is a very solid product and the best electric toothbrush out of the several I have tried throughout the years.</li>
    <li> As stated in a previous comment, in order to utilize the toothbrush app (and really utilize the full functionality of the toothbrush) one must allow Oral-B to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Record audio&lt;br /&gt;- Approximate location&lt;br /&gt;- Precise location (GPS/network based)&lt;br /&gt;- Read calendar events plus confidential information&lt;br /&gt;- Modify or delete SD card content&lt;br /&gt;- Read the SD card content&lt;br /&gt;- Full network access&lt;br /&gt;- View network connections&lt;br /&gt;- Access Bluetooth settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is ludicrous. Bought locally and returned for a non-invasive electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> For those skeptical of the &#x27;innovative&#x27; Bluetooth toothbrush app, don&#x27;t worry, this electric toothbrush functions just fine without it. Although if you&#x27;re switching from a standard brush to this high-powered electric brush, I would actually recommend checking out the app, at least at first. The power behind this toothbrush is similar to what you would expect at a dentist cleaning and can be somewhat tricky to navigate. The app helps you build a brushing regimen that specifically works with the bristle&#x27;s movement. You also get alerts when applying too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the app is kinda ridiculous for anyone over the age of 9. The commercial propaganda emphasizes the \\&quot;smiley face reward\\&quot; at the end of your brush. That&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s pointless. My guess is that the real (profitable) purpose of the app is to remind you when it&#x27;s time to buy another brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the toothbrush itself is impressive. As I say, it feels just like a polish at the dentist office. It takes a long time to initially charge the battery (about 24 hours) but after that I just set it back on the charger when I&#x27;m done so it never really runs out of juice. The &#x27;splatter zone&#x27; of the toothbrush is far and wide. The bristles move so rapidly that water and spittle fly across the room causing a mess. I&#x27;m able to be more prepared for this, however, so I&#x27;ve been able to control my mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: The Deep Sweep 5000 is an excellent, professional-quality toothbrush. The Bluetooth app is fun for about 4 brushes and then you&#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
    <li> I will admit my oral care has never been a priority with me. One , I hate mint! And everything oral care is mint, mega-mint, ultra-mint and EXTREME MINT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I bought my first electric toothbrush ( a cheep basic model) and I liked it enough I decided to upgrade to this one. Overall this one is a great brush. I like that the on/off button is higher up so I don&#x27;t accidentally bump it while brushing. It has several setting for how you want to brush as well as different brush heads as well for when you want to do a specific task while brushing. The battery life is long between charging, in fact I have yet to have to recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has several sensors that track how long you brush, when you brush and how hard you brush. Apparently I have been brushing to hard all my life. There are yellow and red LEDs that come on when you do brush to hard and that is one annoying feature of this brush, the LEDs are a little too bright. It was like brushing under your Christmas tree when I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has Bluetooth capability that allows it to interact with a free app. Unfortunately that app is not in the Amazon App store and the sites that do have it are not compatible with my Amazon Fire Tablet, my only Bluetooth device. So I cannot test out that feature. Hopefully they will make it available soon, if so I will update this review.</li>
    <li> So I think the bluetooth part is gimmicky, but you can also just totally ignore that feature if you want. You don&#x27;t have to connect to your toothbrush to use it. That said, if you&#x27;ve shopped other electric brushes, you&#x27;ve probably seen some that come with a small, separate display that you can stick on your bathroom wall, which shows you brush times and so forth. The bluetooth feature on this brush just turns your phone into that display. Which is nice. If you want a display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the display for a while but then just stopped. The toothbrush itself gives you all the feedback you need -- you&#x27;re meant to brush your teeth in quarters (top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left), 30 seconds each, and it will buzz and flash green every 30 seconds to let you know you can switch areas, then buzzes twice after 2 minutes to let you know you&#x27;ve hit the suggested 2 minute mark for brushing your teeth. It also flashes red if you&#x27;re pressing too hard. The bluetooth app will tell you this stuff too and may be useful to people who are new to the electric toothbrush concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that out of the way, the brush itself is great. This is a top tier electric brush. If you&#x27;ve never used one before, it can take some getting used to but it&#x27;s a vast improvement over traditional brushing. Electric brushes work the gums and crevices much better than regular brushing. If you&#x27;re familiar with brushes and are just shopping for a new one, I think this will be a good one. My previous brush was an Oral-B as well, purchased about 3 years ago and was still going strong. After years of use it didn&#x27;t look quite as pretty or hold a charge quite as long but it was durable. Despite being dropped multiple times, it never gave me any problems at all. I&#x27;m hoping this model will prove to be as good.</li>
    <li> I have never had a fancy or smart toothbrush. I just started using electric toothbrushes last year in fact. But this Deep Sweep makes me want to change my brushing life. It is a fantastic, high quality toothbrush that really gets in tough places and TELLS you how and when to brush. My toothbrush has more brushing knowledge than me, I honestly blame my parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It directs you to download an app on the iOS or Play store, and then it connects with your phone through Bluetooth. It sounds a little daunting at first, and the whole &#x27;2 minute brush&#x27; at first feels like forever, but eventually you get used to it. The brush tells you every time 30 seconds passes, and even warns you if your brushing your teeth too hard (I didn&#x27;t know this was a thing). Also, it has different modes for different types of brushing! You are going to be hard pressed to find a nicer, fancier toothbrush than this one at this price. Grab it while you can.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for this electric toothbrush even on its lowest/gentlest setting it felt... violent against my teeth. Just a slight misjudgment of position and hard, vibrating, plastic was hammering at my teeth. I was also unable to get the toothbrush to pair with my Samsung Galaxy Tab2 tablet. I could still use the timer on the app but it&#x27;s just as easy to look at a clock.&lt;br /&gt;Even when I was able to successfully use this toothbrush it just didn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean feeling as I was and am able to with a manual toothbrush.  I&#x27;ll be going back to the old fashioned toothbrush. The handle is fairly heavy and bulky and somewhat awkward to use. This device just didn&#x27;t impress me in any way.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this unit in comparison to a Waterpik WP 900 combination electric brush and water irrigation kit. I have to say, in comparison to that kit&#x27;s brush, I like this one better. It has a few things going for it - the Oral B heads offer great variety, and the included head has lots of swishing action across the whole brush head. The brush itself has two very nice features in its 30 second timer (it buzzes and lights green every thirty seconds, helping you time different mouth areas) and its pressure alert (a red LED blinks when you apply undue pressure in your mouth). These two features make you really aware of your brushing behavior, something the Waterpik does not. I wish the brush had dimmer LEDs that didn&#x27;t blink so aggressively. At night, this brush had me turning it every which way to try to obscure the light at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the bluetooth functions go, I was unable to test them, as I use Windows Phone. I realize this will not affect 90% of smartphone users, but it does me. The app purports to track brush usage over time to offer improvement advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparing this to the Waterpik WP 900 (available on Amazon), the Oral B is a superior brush but includes no flossing element. The Waterpik also costs significantly less. As such, It&#x27;s not a slam dunk recommendation. If you prefer lots of data and lots of brush head choices, this might be the one to go with. But if you want a decent brush sans bluetooth, and an excellent water flosser, the WP-900 might be the way to go.</li>
    <li> Having owned two sonicare elite toothbrushes in the past decade I am already biased because I&#x27;ve been a happy product owner.  I felt like it was time to give the competition a try, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m feeling kind of &#x27;meh&#x27; about this toothbrush.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Bluetooth &amp; app functionality.  I honestly had zero interest in this.  I know my tooth brushing habits are fine, including pressure, brush time, and mouth &#x27;regions&#x27;, so I don&#x27;t need an App to pat me on the back or chastise me about what I&#x27;m up to with my oral hygiene.  I&#x27;m just not sure I&#x27;m convinced many people will bother unless you&#x27;re really trying to coach someone to be a better tooth brusher who is motivated by feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  It&#x27;s really loud!  Compared to my sonicare it&#x27;s about twice as loud and I definitely need to close the bathroom door when brushing so the buzzing noise doesn&#x27;t wake the kids up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Brush head.  It&#x27;s large, and the neck is thick so I can&#x27;t actually get a good seal on my lips when I&#x27;m brushing with my mouth closed. I know that sounds trite, but as a result I always end up &#x27;drooling&#x27; toothpaste down the brush and it makes a big mess.  Not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Ergonomics.  This sucker is clunky, probably because it has to house a bluetooth antenna...but it just feels really chunky in my grip.  I can imagine it bothering smaller hands but I tolerated it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Ultrasonic?  is it me but isn&#x27;t that one of the selling points of these high end toothbrushes is that it uses ultrasonic technology to help break up plaque?  This just feels like a very thorough motorized brush, but definitely didn&#x27;t get a sense of ultrasonic vibes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the flashing lights when you press too hard or when it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants, however, and I feel like it does at least a decent job of cleaning my teeth, certainly better than a regular toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t ding this too badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Deep Sweep 5000 Smartseries Toothbrush has a unique feature which I have never seen before. It has Bluetooth connectivity and an app you can download for your iPhone or iPad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has a unique movement, sweeping the bristles back and forth which seems to make the toothbrush perform better. It is basically the next generation of a sonic toothbrush, giving your teeth a deep and powerful clean. It is pretty much the same size as a SonicCare toothbrush and seems to work as well. There is a blue light on the base, which seems to be constantly on when the toothbrush is placed on the recharger. This is a little annoying because the light is visible and distracting from our bedroom, when we are trying to sleep. The solution is that we just keep the brush off the base overnight and replace it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Bluetooth feature may seem neat, it doesn&#x27;t work very well. We tried syncing the toothbrush with the app and that didn&#x27;t work. It seems like the only way to use the app in concert with the toothbrush is to have the app (and you iPhone or iPad on) at the same time you are brushing. Now, I don&#x27;t know about you, but Murphy&#x27;s Law is something that has proven itself to exist in my life. Therefore, if I have my iPad on, near a faucet and water, while brushing, something will eventually happen to my iPad. Also, the instructions carefully note that Oral-B can not guarantee that the Bluetooth will work. Huh? So this feature is not really worth it.</li>
    <li> I would have never expected to see a blue tooth - tooth brush! The unit is easy to set up with the App available online at the app store or google apps. The menu gives you options to set up brushing times, performance and monitors brushing habits. I set mine up with the blue tooth but noticed that each time I started the brush I had to go back into my iphone and click on the app. For some reason it would not record the data until I did that. I am still trying to work on that aspect of it as I am sure it will automatically set up. The toothbrush itself is very powerful unlike the battery operated brushes. LED lights will light up red when brushing if you are depressing the brush down to far. The top part of the brush rotates left to right at a high speed, allowing for excellent plaque removal. The only issue is that you need to shut the brush off if you remove it from  your mouth or the saliva, toothpaste will shoot all over the place. I wish there was a speed control button on the brush. In the world of bluetooth technology I just don&#x27;t see the need for a toothbrush with this option. I don&#x27;t see this as a long term brush for me.</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommends the Oral-B toothbrush and thinks the program that this brush allows is just fine.  The fact that warning is given if one pushes too hard is an extra plus.  Also the brush is fun to use and keeps one&#x27;s habits on track.  All and all, a very good product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite electric toothbrush ever. The combination of features is unparalleled and really help motivate good dental hygiene. I really do feel (this is so cliché) that just-from-the-dentist feeling after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using electric toothbrushes since the early 1990s, everything from the Sonicare to the Crest Spinbrush to (most recently) three progressively-better Oral-B handles. The Oral-B toothbrushes and their system of interchangeable brush heads with different specialties, are fantastic, across the board. If you want the best Oral-B experience this year, this is the toothbrush to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# Bluetooth on a toothbrush?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of a toothbrush as a Bluetooth device seemed ridiculous to me at first, but being a gadget nerd, I had to try it out. In the end, what Oral-B produced is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bluetooth is used to communicate brushing session information to an iPhone/Android app. Basically, it drives a timer, which is key to what Oral-B is trying to sell. They want you to brush a full 2 minutes, which seems like an eternity at first. Pretty much all Oral-B toothbrushes (this one and ones much less expensive) will pulse every 30 seconds and at the 2-minute mark to help you time your brushing session. The in-app timer helps you visualize this, and it is surprisingly motivating compared to the brush pulses. This is the first toothbrush gimmick that has gotten me to consistently brush for 2 minutes at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush will give you a warning if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure. It will also store session information (up to 10, I think) and sync with the phone later, so you don&#x27;t always need your phone one you to brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# The iPhone App&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iPhone app is surprisingly good. It has a clean design that appears to be based on the average of modern iOS and Android design. Overall, the app is well thought-out and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushing timer starts and stops automatically with the toothbrush (over Bluetooth). It can also listen for the sound of the toothbrush if Bluetooth isn&#x27;t on for some reason. To help you get through that entire 2-minute brushing session, the app displays news and weather, photos, and other things, in-app, while you brush. It is kind of clever, but the news articles weren&#x27;t often that relevant to my location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The app will track your brushing, flossing, tongue-cleaning, and rinsing. It prompts you to do each one in sequence. You can customize these prompts to match your routine. The app awards smiles, sounds, and badges to help keep you motivated. Everything works really well. If you like to track your weight, food, and activity (with MyFitnessPal, FitBit, Jawbone Up, etc.), you will probably like to track your toothbrushing, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# The toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is larger than older/lower-priced Oral-B toothbrushes, and is comfortable to hold. It has some very bright lights on it that are on when in use and when it is charging. The charging lights are very bright and are animated while charging, which could be a problem if you need to store it where you sleep--in a dorm room for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# Brush heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Deep Sweep brush head that comes with this toothbrush is my new favorite. It feels the most like normal tooth-brushing and cleans very well. There are various other brush heads you can buy that are compatible with this and with other Oral-B toothbrushes. The brush-head holder base encourages you to try several. I have been alternating between the Deep Sweep, Floss Action, and Sensitive Clean brush heads, and really like how easy and .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B brush heads are quite expensive, which is the only con, really, of the Oral-B system. There are compatible generic heads available, which I usually buy because they are much cheaper. The generic brush heads are far cheaper and appear to be adequate, but they do not slide on and off as well as the Oral-B heads, and their bristles are not as high quality. That said, they are OK if you want to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# The base&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base comes in two parts which snap together, in case you don&#x27;t want to use the brush head holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# The travel case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included travel case holds the toothbrush handle and two brush heads. This is a fantastic accessory, because it allows you to bring your familiar (and great) toothbrushing experience from home with you. The toothbrush should last a week (two 2-minute brushes per day) before it needs a charge. In my experience with older Oral-B brushes, that claim is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# Keeping it clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric toothbrushes, like all toothbrushes, can become gunky and nasty if you don&#x27;t take care of them. The easiest way to keep this one clean is to remove the brush head, rinse off the handle, and towel the handle dry after each use. This sounds like a lot, but it only takes about 5 seconds, and having a special brush-head storage area in the base makes it very easy.</li>
    <li> It took 24 hours to charge this out of the box, and although it comes with accessories like a travel case and a brush holder, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to display it all, so just store those and have kept the small charger and brush on my bathroom counter. The brush defaults to the Professional Timer (a quick pulse at 30 seconds for each quadrant of your mouth, a longer, more stuttered pulse at 2 minutes - the recommended total brushing time) and the Daily Clean mode. These are all I need, so I have not fussed with trying out the other clean modes or installing the app. Frankly, there is no way I&#x27;m bringing my phone to the bathroom or near a sink. No thank you! I can keep track of my own cleaning habits, and I actually enjoy the 2 minutes of brushing my teeth as a sort of &amp;#34;zen&amp;#34; moment - I don&#x27;t need the app features of checking weather and news to keep me occupied. I do like that the brush will tell me when my pressure is too hard, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my gums bleeding (the manual warns this might happen when you first start using the brush). The brush has a nice, streamlined profile, and it&#x27;s easy to reach all the areas I need to brush, and it does leave my mouth feeling very fresh. Careful not to mistake the &amp;#34;mode&amp;#34; button for the power button. I did that the other day - pressed the mode button, removed the toothbrush from my mouth, let go of the button, and since I had not in fact powered off the brush, I got a face &amp; blouse full of toothpaste as I struggled to press the actual power button. Ridiculous, I know, but easy to do! With the push towards &amp;#34;more tech! more tech!&amp;#34;, I can see why Oral-B tried to integrate Bluetooth into this model, but I think it&#x27;s a perfect fine toothbrush without those bells and whistles!</li>
    <li> I have been a Sonicare user for many years. This Oral-B is a very good sonic toothbrush and cleans my teeth just as well as Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the features that I really like are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- compatible with any Oral-B brush head and there are so many (affordable!) options to choose from. Too many of times have I purchased the wrong version head for my Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Brushing app: I don&#x27;t care for Bluetooth technology in general. I carry my phone around too much as it is and the last place it needs to be is in the bathroom. You gotta weigh your own pros and cons on this one. However, my teenager who needs to focus on better brushing thinks it is very cool. Whatever works :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- pressure sensor: I have been scolded by my hygientist for brushing too hard. This is a much appreciated feature and makes the app worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- super long charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- nice travel case</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Pro 5000 Bluetooth Electric toothbrush is a fine electric toothbrush consistent with the well earned reputation of Oral-B for oral hygiene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a Rotadent Classic which I got from my dentist. The [[ASIN:B00GODZ4Y4 Rotadent Contour]] is the current version of my old electric toothbrush and is in the same price range as the Pro 5000. This was my starting point when I got the Oral-B Pro 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I unpacked the Pro 5000 it came with the inductive charging base which has storage for several brush heads with a plastic cover. There is also a blue travel case with space to two heads. The brush fits the case with the head removed. The head that comes with the brush is the cross angle head which is supposed to deep clean. It seems to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro 5000 I got had zero residual charge and took several hours before it would start. The inductive charging is a nice approach as no electrical connections are exposed. The full charge time was about 30h (the bright blue blinking charge lights go out when the brush is at full charge). A full charge should last about a week brushing twice a day for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Rotadent classic has no charge indicators and is a pretty plain electric toothbrush. It sits in the charger all the time and I use a plain toothbrush when I travel. Its brush heads are very soft by comparison to the Oral-B Pro 5000. Both weigh about the same. The Rotadent is definitely a low-tech electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing experience:&lt;br /&gt;The dentist supplied Rotadent is a pure rotational toothbrush. It does not vibrate a lot and it is very gentle on my gums. I was not displeased with how it cleaned my teeth. The switch (after several years) is beginning to wear out so a new toothbrush was in order. This is my basis for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Pro 5000 gives a much more aggressive default brushing experience. It vibrates fast and hard enough that my lips got a kind of numb feeling the first few times. The bristles of the brush head are much more stiff than the Rotadent and it has taken some time to adjust to that combination bristles and a much more aggressive brushing action. I initially had some sore and bleeding gums but this seems to be passing as I get used to this new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the brush head is too hard for you there are a variety of other heads which might work better if the dual clean is too harsh. I am planning to try the [[ASIN:B008CC3SKW Sensitive Clean Brush Head]] which I hope will be more comfortable but still clean well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro 5000 has 5 modes of cleaning with different purposes. The old Rotadent classic  has one mode that is less harsh than any on the Rotadent. I have been using the daily clean mode in my use so far. The modes are:&lt;br /&gt; - daily clean&lt;br /&gt; - sensitive&lt;br /&gt; - massage&lt;br /&gt; - whitening&lt;br /&gt; - deep clean&lt;br /&gt;The button below the power button with the &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; on it changes the modes. There is no indication of the selected mode on the brush. Holding the mode button for 5 seconds will reset the brush to the &amp;#34;daily clean&amp;#34; mode and pressing the mode button will cycle through the modes in the order above. The Oral-B app displays the current mode. For me his is the most helpful aspect of the app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several days using the Pro 5000 I can say my teeth feel quite noticeably cleaner than with the Rotadent classic. This IS the point of brushing teeth, after all! So the Pro 5000 wins kudos for its primary function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Features:&lt;br /&gt;The Pro 5000 has several helpful indicators while brushing. The older Rotadent has none..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best indicator for me is the 30 second &amp;#34;hiccup&amp;#34; that lets me count off the time to two minutes of brushing. The next is the over-pressure sensor which lights a strip on the brush up red when I press too hard. This is oriented so I can easily see it in the bathroom mirror. These help me directly to brush better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bluetooth, Apps and tracking:&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by the bluetooth aspect of the Pro 5000 as it felt cool and innovative. In practice I find it&#x27;s not really helpful for me. I&#x27;m just not that into tracking my brushing history or tied to my iPhone enough to always have it in the bathroom with the Oral-B app running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The app ONLY works with the brush in real-time. It gives additional feedback for time and pressure and records a history of brushing sessions. Of course this is only when you remember to have it running when you brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro 5000 does not save brushing session information for later download if app isn&#x27;t present. I think this really limits the usefulness of the bluetooth and app&#x27;s statistics and might have been simple to add. Maybe Oral-B will take this suggestion!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other app functions include display of the current brushing mode, reminders for tongue cleaning and flossing, and motivational badges for meeting certain predefined brushing goals, tongue cleanings, and flossing. While the reminders and badges may be helpful to some people seem kind of silly to me. I track auto mileage and a bunch of other stuff, but I&#x27;m just not that into tracking my brushing when it requires I have my iPhone in the bathroom and running their app for my morning routine. Sorry Oral-B!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Pro 5000 Bluetooth Toothbrush is very nice with an aggressive brushing style. The 30s hiccup and over-pressure light are helpful in doing a better and more consistent job at brushing and give most of the feedback of the app without the needing app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush&#x27;s mode indicator is the most useful part of the bluetooth and the app. The app is not that useful to me but may be good for goal oriented people who will have their mobile device running the app in the bathroom every time they brush. If the brush saved data for download the usefulness of the app would be enhanced for tracking purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it does not store brushing data for download it makes the bluetooth aspect of the brush a lot less usable for me. I&#x27;m just not that tied to my iPhone that I carry it into the bathroom for my morning routine. Instead I think the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B 3000]] would be a better value at about half the price for people who can live without the real-time feedback on their phone or tracking their every brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is my teeth feel cleaner and I feel I am brushing better than with my old Rotadent classic. This is the bottom line and for me the measure of a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, one star off an otherwise excellent electric toothbrush with lots of tech (for a toothbrush!) 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone!tter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bluetooth, Apps and tracking:&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by the bluetooth aspect of the Pro 5000 as it felt cool and innovative.

    <li> Comparing to another very similar battery-powered toothbrush I can say easily that there is a difference. Although this difference is a feature that is advertised with the Oral-B, it is something that is apparent if you have used other e-brushes. This feature is the &#x27;pressure detection&#x27;. With another popular e-brush I tried the problem was in essences sensitivity of my teeth. While brushing, the other e-brush did not lessen its power when I pressed harder on my teeth (to get a cleaner brush). After using it for a few months, the sensitivity of my teeth began appear--the brush was brushing too hard when I pressed hard. With the Oral-B, the harder you press, the more it lessens due to it &#x27;sensing&#x27; how hard you are brushing. So far, after a month or so of use, no sensitivity problems have arose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above paragraph is my reason for rating this e-brush as I did. Simply, it cleans very well (better than my manual &#x27;toothbrushing&#x27; technique) and does not irritate my mouth. For a toothbrush, this is all I want and all I ask for. The Oral-B does exactly that where others have not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a general rundown of other mentions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[---Quality---]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing too different here versus other e-brushes. Plastic outer shell and white shiny appearance. The included brushhead is firm but soft and has strong &#x27;tensiles&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[---Brush Speeds---]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 different types of speeds or &#x27;modes&#x27;. The first one is a steady pulsing that is medium-firm. As stated above, the harder you press on the tooth, the lower the &#x27;power&#x27; of the brushing--keep your teeth perfectly non-sensitive. The latter is the one I use the most as the others have varying pulses that are not really for straight tooth brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[---Battery---]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having left it on the charger over night, I have seen it only needing charge maybe once in 2 weeks. Very travel friendly and is able to sustain 2 brushes daily for a week or more. If you are going on a short trip, charge it overnight and do not bring the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few functions that an electric toothbrush should perform and many ways to not perform them well. My experience with the Oral-B over other competitors tells me that the Oral-B is in the right direction and the best one I have used thus far., charge it overnight and do not bring the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few functions that an electric toothbrush should perform and many ways to not perform them well.

    <li> This Oral B is Magnificent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a rechargeable toothbrush on steroids!  The Deep Sweep toothbrushes are a new range recently brought out by Oral-B. The manufacturer makes some bold promises, none-less-so than the 5000 model “removes up to 76% more plaque vs. Sonicare in hard to reach areas“. This is not a claim that I can in any way substantiate; BUT at least I can do is take a look at the features of this brush to see if it’s worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First up, This Oral B is Magnificent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and it has LOTS of happy users.&lt;br /&gt;*  Easy to use - designed to be used like a manual brush&lt;br /&gt;*  Extra-long battery life (of up to 10 days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To expand on the first point – most electric toothbrushes come need to be used slightly differently, ie you need to alter your technique compared to using a non-powered brush. The Oral-B Deep Sweep is used exactly like a ‘normal’ brush – but does a better job of plaque removal.  I also LOVE the “TriAction” mode by which this toothbrush works. There are three different sets of bristles on the brushhead (two of which move side to side and one of which remains stationary) – thus a ‘triple’ action as you brush your teeth.  The TriAction incorporates three bristle zones. One group of shorter bristles remain static – ie like a manual brush. The two moving groups both sweep and pulsate simultaneously, producing 8,800 sweeping motions per minute.  One group of shorter bristles remain static – ie like a manual brush. The two moving groups both sweep and pulsate simultaneously, producing 8,800 sweeping motions per minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A ‘hard -brushing alert’, ie a pressure sensor which  notifies you if you are over-scrubbing. This can be very useful, especially if you are one of the many patients who brush too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A two minute timer, which also has a 30 second ‘quadrant prompt’ which reminds you of when to move the brush to another corner of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent battery life of 7 days for the 1000 model and a great 10 days for the 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS BRUSH, you&#x27;ll LOVE IT!br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent battery life of 7 days for the 1000 model and a great 10 days for the 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS BRUSH, you&#x27;ll LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I bought my first electric toothbrush about a decade ago, deciding on an Oral-B over the Sonicare because I had read reviews that indicated it cleaned better. It last me many years, and finally in 2008, Oral-B added a new feature that made it worth the upgrade. They introduced the pulsing &amp;#34;3-D&amp;#34; action head with the flossing bristles. The upgrade from my decade old Oral-B to the pulsing was a great upgrade. I greatly enjoyed my Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush.  Since that time I have tried both the Oral-B 5000 and Oral-B 7000.  This is a new version of the 5000 which is essentially a very similar toothbrush, but includes bluetooth and also a more traditional shaped head which moves back and forth, rather than the round heads you typically see on electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, if you are considering an electric toothbrush, you may wonder if they do any good. The truth is that an electric toothbrush doesn&#x27;t clean any better than a person who does a thorough job with a manual toothbrush. However, most of us stink at brushing our teeth, much to our dentists&#x27; financial delight. The electric toothbrush makes it easier to clean teeth well. I especially needed one because I had trouble with my back molars (there isn&#x27;t room to move a brush!) and had some decay. Since I got my Oral-B with 3-D action, I had great reports from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, Oral-B&#x27;s toothbrush offerings get better by small increments each year. If you already own an Oral-B with 3-D action made in the last 5 years, you likely don&#x27;t need to upgrade. This system is truly one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest change over the previous Oral-B brushes that had the “smart guide” screen is that instead of a separate smart guide, this one has bluetooth and connects to your phone.  The connection was easy to setup, and the Oral-B app gives you a nice graphical guide for brushing your teeth along with a timer to make sure you spend enough time in the various quadrants of your mouth.  It also shows a news feed with local news and information, giving you some reading material to keep you engrossed in brushing for 2 whole minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve never owned an electric toothbrush, this is a top option.  If you already have a recent Oral-B, the bluetooth is neat but I found after a week that I stopped wanting to grab my phone every time I brushed my teeth.  Now my phone is bugging me that it’s been a month since I brushed, but I just don’t see the need for the app.  So it’s cool but not a must have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a 5 stars toothbrush – love it.quadrants of your mouth.
