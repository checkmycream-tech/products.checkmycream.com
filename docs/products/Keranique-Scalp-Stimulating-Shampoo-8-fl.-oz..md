<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product.  Gives nice volume to your hair.  You can use it with or without the Keranique Volumizing Conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo. Stop my hair from shedding. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo line two years ago after being sick with Chronic Appendicitis and medication starting making my hair REALLY fall out and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It has really helped slow down the hair loss and allowed regrowth.</li>
    <li> I get the same results with generic shampoos. I am truly disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product did not meet my expectations!</li>
    <li> Using this shampoo took several months to show results, so don&#x27;t be discouraged. I have chin length hair, so my bottle went a long way.  But when I went to get my hair cut even my hair stylist noticed that my hair was so much thicker and more healthy.  So now I am able to grow my hair longer, which makes me extremely happy.  I will always use Keranique.  I have tried many products that promise to regrow hair, but didn&#x27;t do anything but cost me money.  If you are in need because of hair loss or want thicker more healthy hair, then this is the product.  And it even smells good.</li>
    <li> The shampoo seems to be helping however, I found a larger container for less money at a local retailer.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended!  I have been using it about a year and can tell a lot of difference in my hair.I actyally like my hair again.</li>
    <li> I used the first bottle and noticed a big difference.</li>
    <li> not happy with this purchase--made hair feel harsh and after reading other views of customers who are not satisfied, i regret this decision to order this product.</li>
    <li> It appears to have helped stimulate hair growth.</li>
    <li> hair seems to fall out less when I use it.  Maybe it is psychological, since it is so close to my brain....</li>
    <li> Great price and product!</li>
    <li> Again, happy wife, happy life,..</li>
    <li> its the best shampoo ever in the planet..too sad they don&#x27;t have hear vytamins?.. still? is the best..[abbythebaby]..abiasaph/Maldonado..n.j?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[this testimony?is opsolutly? forviden to comersial:..from amazon..or..keranique?[with/out my permition?.att/abiasaph Maldonado,</li>
    <li> Got my hair clean....I was more stimulated by the coffee than the shampoo. But it works, it does what shampoo is suppose to. Got my hair clean.</li>
    <li> The is without a doubt the best shampoo -- EVER!  And if your hair is thinning, YOU CANNOT DO without it.... It&#x27;s amazing how quickly it begam helping revive and re-grow my hair, after a long Bout with thyroid disease that took a BIG Toll on my hair!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for over a year and it had significantly improved my thin, fine hair.  I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I brought the product for my mother also, and she also loves the product.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the shampoo and the other products for 2 weeks but I like the way my hair looks and feels</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  I have always used medium priced shampoos thinking all were the same.  There is a definate difference.  Leaves my hair in much better condition after just one shampoo.  Pricey</li>
    <li> Definitely works for me. Stimulates my hair growth. Love it. Grow baby grow.</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected.  Makes my hair feel and look greasy.  Would not buy again.  Very expensive for the results received.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair from losing a lot of weight and my hair felt and looked straggly.  I decided to try this shampoo  even though I felt it was a lot of money for only 8 oz.  After purchasing it and waiting for its arrival, I read some of the reviews that it received  how it dried people&#x27;s hair out and their hair was breaking.  Needless to say, when I received the shampoo I was very leery about using it.  I finally decided to give it a whirl using it every other day with my other shampoo to make sure my hair didn&#x27;t get dry or break.  After awhile, I started using it every day and now it is my favorite shampoo.  I actually hair all new hair growing that I can see around my scalp and when I wash my hair, I feel like it has substance to it whereas before, it felt like I had no hair on my head at all.  My hair looks and feels better and appears thicker.  Went to have my hair dyed  yesterday and my hairdresser said she has never felt my  hair so soft.  I hate the fact that it costs so much money for so little and it is hard to get out of the bottle and you need to use more than you do with other shampoos to get a good lather going, but I love this shampoo and as long as it  continues to do what it is doing to my hair, I will be using it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3 step kit awhile back, (Shampoo, Conditioner, Regrowth serum), it seemed to work, I had some new growth and the hair wasn&#x27;t coming out as bad when I washed it.  But I was also taking hair vitamins and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the vitamins or the keranique that was helping me.  I slowly got away from using the keranique, started using regular shampoo and not treating with the regrowth, and after a couple months I was right back where I started with my hair thinning and falling out with every wash.  I&#x27;ve gone back to the Keranique and once again I have new hair growth and not as much loss.  The Keranique appears to be working for me.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I am using it for over a year and my hair improved a lot. It really works!!!</li>
    <li> GREAT product!!  It gave me body, shine and fullness with the  very first use!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m encouraged, but, too soon to know if I LOVE IT (and, due to high price for a rather small container, I must set a high &amp;#34;bar&#x27; for a rinse-out shampoo.  Unsure if I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very drying to my scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> My sister loves it.  it has helped reduce hair on her shoulders! She has blonde hair which is more obvious than dark on her dark clothing.</li>
    <li> To expensive for the amount you get.  It is my second bottle and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my hair.</li>
    <li> One use and I saw a definite difference in volume of my very fine hair - felt thicker and had more volume &amp; body - impressed!  Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> love it. makes my hair feel so silky.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it I thought I saw a difference but after that I felt my hair looked worse. I have stop using it as my hair looks thinner when I do and I fear it could be harming my hair. Defiantly a waste of money</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and mousse!  They both give my thinning hair awesome volume and fullness!  I&#x27;m a southern gal and I like big hair and this product does the trick!</li>
    <li> Great for thinning hair!  Makes hair look fuller.  Less hair loss in the drain.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but my hair has been thinning in the past couple of years and I was getting frustrated.  My BF is older than i am and has male pattern baldness and so I decided to get the whole kit and try it out. I dont use the rogaine, but he does, and we both use the shampoo and conditioner.  We both noticed a difference within a few days.  We have purchased it 3 times since last April, and I saw a difference in the condition of my hair when I went too long between orders and had to use another shampoo.  I highly recommend, and yes, it smells great too!</li>
    <li> It seems to work fine. I don&#x27;t really like the smell of it nor am I impressed by it making my hair thicker</li>
    <li> Great Hair Product - Saw a difference in hair and couldn&#x27;t be happier with results. Definitely recommend. This has become a product that I always order more of when I am running low.</li>
    <li> It does work as advertised</li>
    <li> A perfect product, my hair is very full and pretty.</li>
    <li> My hair has thinned through the years and this shampoo &amp; the conditioner seem to give my hair some volume.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for thin hair that I have ever found. A lot of volume with this product.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> great product, good price.</li>
    <li> Has increased my sister&#x27;s hair growth by leaps and bounds.</li>
    <li> I have weak, thinning hair due to lupus and the many medications I am on, so I have been looking for a shampoo to help me.  Keranique has proven to be the best product I have found.  Using this in conjunction with the Keranique amplifying spray gives my hair body and lift.  These are wonderful products and I will be using them from now on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Keranique shampoo for almost a year now and it does help with hair regrowth. I&#x27;m very happy with the results and will continue to use it. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and have used Bumble&amp; Bumble thickening shampoo for years.  I wanted to try something new, but totally regret buying this product.  I&#x27;ve used this shampoo several times, and it leaves my hair dull, flat and lifeless.  It almost has a greasy look to it as if I haven&#x27;t shampooed my hair in days.  I gave it 1star b/c it does have a fresh, clean scent.  I learned a pricey lesson and will go back to the B&amp;B!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not saying it works because I am taking vitamins to go with it, but my hair is growing back.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; customer service</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if the shampoo actually stimulates growth.  I do know that using the three products (shampoo, conditioner and amplifying spray) make a positive difference.</li>
    <li> I have recently begun to use the product and cannot as yet evaluate properly. Perhaps once I have used it for several weeks. All I can say now is that it feels good in my scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is unbelievable. You know how you see ads making all these promises about what this or that product will do for you. Well, this is one product that delivers. I know I sound like an ad, but it truly has made such a difference. As I&#x27;ve aged, my hair has gotten thinner. I started taking Biosil (a hair, skin, and nails product) and also started using this shampoo. My hair is thicker and longer than it&#x27;s been in years. It took about a month before I could really tell the difference, and I wash my hair every other day, so about 15 uses. A little goes a long way too.  So bottom line, I&#x27;m not sure how much is the shampoo and how much is the vitamin, but these two things together have made a huge difference for me. On a down note, I tried the Keranique Mousse, and it just made my hair weird. I regifted it to someone with a different hair texture, and she didn&#x27;t like what it did to her hair either. Don&#x27;t recommend that one, but the shampoo? Big yes.</li>
    <li> Cleans hair very well, pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  I don&#x27;t lose as much hair when using this product as I do when using other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I cannot say for sure yet that this product does all it claims to do but it does seem to help some.  It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> my hair was falling out and I used the Keranique system and it stopped the falling out and seems to be growing back. Time wll tell.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair great body and my hair is very easy to style now.. I have very fine and thinning hair and this shampoo makes my hair feel thicker fuller, healthier.. I am losing less hair too.  It is a great product and will continue using it..</li>
    <li> I found my hair literally falling out in strands. I have had long hair all my life and didn&#x27;t want to loose it. I tried everything on the market and this hair loss line of shampoos, scalp treatments and conditioners are the only ones I&#x27;ve found to be actually working. I have stopped losing so much of my hair and have started seeing regrowth begin. Also buying from Amazon is the only smart way to purchase this great product line.</li>
    <li> This is the third bottle I have bought for my 65 year old mother. She was losing her hair after a lengthy illness. We went to have her hair cut the other day, and sure enough, she had grown new hair where it was once balding and thinning. I had her combine this shampoo with biotin, b-12 and a multivitamin to nourish her hair form the inside as well. Either way, she has grown hair. I was doubtful in the beginning, but this has proven effective.  It is worth the money, especially to see my lovely mother get her confidence back.</li>
    <li> It smells great, leaves hair soft and clean but it did nothing for my hair falling out. Infact I think even more came out using this</li>
    <li> Not that impressed with the shampoo.  I have used it for weeks now and see no improvement.</li>
    <li> I really love Keranique, it doesn&#x27;t matter what it does or does not do, it&#x27;s just great shampoo!</li>
    <li> like the shampoo and it seems to be doing the job</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo, but, I haven&#x27;t noticed any more hair.  It does leave your scalp nice and clean. This is my second bottle, so I&#x27;ve been using it for a while.  I know everything doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> Not much difference than other shampoos!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually used it for quite awhile now and not only is my hair not falling out like previously, but hair has filled in around my hairline!</li>
    <li> kERANIQUE SHAMPOO&lt;br /&gt;product makes my hair feel and look thicker, I no longer feel bald:)&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products but this beats them all.</li>
    <li> Made my hair THINNER than it already was!! I threw it away-</li>
    <li> While I certainly like the outcome of this product, I don&#x27;t enjoy the medicinal smell.  I prefer a fruity or clean smell to my shampoo.  However, there is a definite difference in the effect when utilizing a more result based product.  I just wish it smelled like coconuts or mango--you get the drift!</li>
    <li> Great deal all around</li>
    <li> Great price for an authentic product</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves your hair feeling like dry straw. Even after using the volumizing conditioner my hair was so tangled that I am pulling out even more hair just trying to comb it out. Plus the price is mind ridiculas.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo - I&#x27;m a fan so far!  I can&#x27;t wait to see the hair growth from this - even if it doesn&#x27;t grow - I&#x27;m thrilled to see the improved condition of my hair.</li>
    <li> I just used it once only, so result was amassing. My hear stopped falling. Latter, I let you know about the result after my 2nd 3rd time to use too. Lets see what will be result.....</li>
    <li> Wife said she was pleasantly surprised... Unfortunately, thinning spots due to medications, but she believes her hair to be filling in thicker with only 2 months of use....  Loves the product.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I have recommended this to others.</li>
    <li> Keranique really works, love it.</li>
    <li> This is working! Hair is growing after usings many products that did not</li>
    <li> Great for thinning Hair</li>
    <li> Just started using it...like the way it leaves your hair..seems like there is more volume.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money because this doesn&#x27;t work. As a matter of fact it makes my scalp itchy and my hair gets greasy. If I could I would give it zero stars instead of one.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo very much.  much better than any of the other ones that I have purchased&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying it</li>
    <li> only my second bottle but liking it so far and my hair isn&#x27;t falling out as badly as before. will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair as much as I used to and I&#x27;ve only used the keranique 3 times  ask me later</li>
    <li> I like the combo of the shampoo and conditioner...in fact I am trying every Keranique product and so far I am impressed with all...also, it seems that just one time washing with this shampoo is enough as opposed to wash, rinse, wash again.</li>
    <li> It made my hair dry up, break off and turned into a tumbleweed! It&#x27;s a rip off and a gimmic.  I&#x27;m a Hair Dresser of 30 years and I would never recommend this product to anyone.. I fact I will tell everyone I know how bad this product is. Shame on you!!</li>
    <li> not worth the money to me, The new  Dove volume shampoo worked even better</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It does not make your hair feel dirty but it does make it feel fuller.</li>
    <li> I have tried Follicure than I heard about Keranique, decide to try Keranique.  I do not like it. it dries up my hair.  I am back in using Follicure.</li>
    <li> I have sent this item back.......it was supposed to be clear and smell flowery.......instead it&lt;br /&gt;was yellow and had a chemical smell.</li>
    <li> my hair is thickening fast and has stopped falling out</li>
    <li> was expecting more i guess....not bad but nothing special.....cant tell that it has done anything to address thinning hair.....it is nice and thick...</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT....I HAD LOST A LOT OF MY HAIR AND NOW I HAVE NEW HAIR GROWING...AMAZING PRODUCT. WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOD BLESS&lt;br /&gt;CAROL</li>
    <li> It did what it supposed  to do, that is to prevent my hair from falling. Goods advertising, go on doing what you are doing.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle and I recommend it to anyone whose hair is thinning.  It leaves your hair shining and feeling really clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the wife and I just love this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t need a lot to make a foaming head full and the conditioner goes a long way too.  I have used cheaper shampoos and can sure tell the difference. I highly recommend the combination to anyone,</li>
    <li> I have severe scalp issues, have tried a lot of things, but this shampoo actually helps</li>
    <li> This product is no different than the average stimulating shampoo.</li>
    <li> shampoo was good for dry scalp and no dandruf.  now i don&#x27;t need to shampoo as often . i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> THe shampoo did not seem to stimulate my hair at all..in fact my hair started to fall out more!&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about this product at all</li>
    <li> I love this past seven Union for a long time it lasts a lot longer than you think far exceeds the time then he cleans my tensile assets in 90 days and sometimes even longer</li>
    <li> Makes my scalp feel fresh and a lot thicker.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo in the past.  I decided it was time to get back to it.  I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I just started on this product and liking it very much.</li>
    <li> This item caused my hair to dry out and crack off after only one application.  I returned it for full refund and could kick myself for not reading all the reviews BEFORE I purchased it.  If I had read the reviews, I NEVER would have tried it.  I hope this review keeps at least one person from using this horrible, hair damaging product!!</li>
    <li> Been using Kernique for a little over a year.  My hair has grown back. AMAZING</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo it really cleans my hair.&lt;br /&gt;And leaves it shiny and very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Just beautiful experience to see my hair grow back.</li>
    <li> This is a product I used and when it ran out I re-ordered.  It seems as tho it works to the degree that I haven&#x27;t lost any more hair, but still not sure if shampoo is the reason, will continue using.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair look fuller after the first use...love it!</li>
    <li> I just starting using the product 2 week ago ,haven&#x27;t  seen any results yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using it but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing what I expected.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I have had good results with my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> i definitely saw a difference in this after the first wash.... my hair was not as dry and frizzy as it was before and after a couple washes...the ends of my hair is in better shape...but my hair does get oily much quicker like really oily....im using both shampoo and condition along with the regrowth serum...however my hair is dropping like crazy and appears to be even thinner at the top of my head...other reviews said that the old hair is lost and then new one grows....cross my fingers that it works.....my hair is thinner...ill be practically bald just now at the top of my head....but shampoo an conditioner seems to work nice !</li>
    <li> Had used this product before, was just looking for a better price and found it! Great product for thin, limp hair.</li>
    <li> Not the real thing! I&#x27;m very unhappy this time around.</li>
    <li> Hair feels good though I can&#x27;t see an increase in volume.</li>
    <li> Ok&amp;#34;...not swing any significant changes</li>
    <li> Used once. within 24 hours had a rash on skin.  I have never had skin issues before.  Would return if I could</li>
    <li> Thank you and I love soft hair and shine</li>
