      <li>I used it to twist &amp; knot freshly</li>
      <li>my hair feels so soft and easy to manage</li>
      <li>For MY hair, it&#x27;s more like a daily hair dressing.</li>
      <li>First time (Sunday)</li>

      <li>May work better for a different texture of hair.</li>
      <li>My little girls hair would look nice for the first 2 hours</li>
      <li>Very dissatisfied.  </li>
      <li>I really like the texture of this</li>
      <li>Too much and your hair LOOKS like it has mousse in it without the crunchiness.</li>
      <li>Monday night, I sectioned &amp; lightly misted my hair &amp; coated each section with the pudding - same fuzzy results.</li>
      <li>I really feel this product works</li>
      <li>and I think this would be good for someone with thick curly/curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It is an excellent product for taming frizzy, curly hair without leaving a heavy, stiff or flaky feel.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try Hair Milk because I was looking for both softness and hold for my newly revealed curly &#x27;fro.</li>
      <li>Soft, soft, SOFT hair!!!  </li>
      <li>This puddin&#x27; makes my hair soft, manageable, and defrizzes!</li>

      <li>I just began the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural hair.</li>

      <li>Works perfectly on my natural hair .</li>
      <li>every 2 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also uses natural ingredients another plus.</li>
      <li>The product didn&#x27;t take from the root to the tip of my natural hair.</li>
      <li>But I did not get the hold to the curl and the definition that I was hoping for once my styling was complete.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do half star, for quick delivery.</li>
      <li>when i first used it, it put it on wet hair and did wash and go.  </li>
      <li>i had MAJOR shrinkage.  </li>
      <li>It left my hair soft with no product residue, but my twist-out was immediately fuzzy.</li>
      <li>It made my naturally curly hair, sticky, kinky, gross and greasy.</li>
      <li>(wheat germ has protein and I&#x27;m protein sensitive), I will use these CD products for one week, then use my non-protein MOISTURIZING products the following week, and continue to alternate in this pattern.</li>

<li> And VOILA, it worked (first I washed my hair and left it a little wet with water before applying anything!)</li>
<li> and then it would look dry and brittle again.</li>
<li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look wet and crunchy, like when you scrunch with mousse without blow drying.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, after my hair dried, it was super dry.</li>
<li> i didnt want to give up yet, so i again left my hair soaking wet, put the pudding all through my hair in small sections, and didnt touch it</li>
<li> A little bit GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
<li> Last night, I applied it to dry sections, twisted and knotted - same fuzzy results.</li>
<li> when i woke up, i unbraided my hair, put a little conditioner on the ends and crown and voila!  </li>
<li> Im definitely not smiling with 40$ in useless hair product im NOT using again.</li>
<li> It help moisturizer your hair and your hair don&#x27;t get hard like a gel</li>
<li> Was not impressed with this product at all.</li>
<li> and I hated the smell.</li>
<li> It also smells terrible!!!  </li>
<li> It is horrible.  </li>

    <li> Paired this with hair milk original leave-in. Very dissatisfied.  Its great that lady on box can smile with her curly hair. I do not beleive she used this on her hair for that picture.  Im definitely not smiling with 40$ in useless hair product im NOT using again.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly on my natural hair . I use it along with the hair milk and cowash for growing the relaxer out of my hair. Would not be without it.</li>
    <li> It help moisturizer your hair and your hair don&#x27;t get hard like a gel but the smell is like leave in don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> Soft, soft, SOFT hair!!!  I have coarse, curly hair.  This puddin&#x27; makes my hair soft, manageable, and defrizzes!</li>
    <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter makes excellent products (many of which I use often), but this didn&#x27;t exactly work for me. I just began the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural hair. I wanted to try Hair Milk because I was looking for both softness and hold for my newly revealed curly &#x27;fro. I definitely got the softness after applying this and twisting my hair into mini bantu knots. But I did not get the hold to the curl and the definition that I was hoping for once my styling was complete. The product didn&#x27;t take from the root to the tip of my natural hair. It smells lovely and it&#x27;s not tacky or super sticky, which is definitely a plus, but I have found better products for my hair routine.</li>
    <li> I really feel this product works my hair feels so soft and easy to manage</li>
    <li> Great product!  Makes my hair soft not hard and crunchy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well with my hair. Was hoping that it would hold curls better. Caused flaking . May work better for a different texture of hair.</li>
    <li> I read all of these glowing reviews, which led me to purchase this product.  I can only ask:  Who are you people, and HOW can you say this product works??!!  It made my naturally curly hair, sticky, kinky, gross and greasy. It also smells terrible!!!  I followed instructions to the last detail.  It is horrible.  I&#x27;m running back to the arms of my wonderful Morrocan hair mask, and never looking back!!! Bottom line:  yuk!!!  One star BC I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do half star, for quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I used to use Miss Jessie&#x27;s but it leaves my hair flaky and I hated the smell. This product does neither. In fact it smells really good. It is a bit pricey (but cheaper than getting my hair done every 2 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also uses natural ingredients another plus.</li>
    <li> i have fallen in love with this product.  i finally figured out how to use it properly.  when i first used it, it put it on wet hair and did wash and go.  i had MAJOR shrinkage.  my boyfriend thought i had cut my hair.  i didnt want to give up yet, so i again left my hair soaking wet, put the pudding all through my hair in small sections, and didnt touch it ( i did this at night while at home).  i then braided it at night.  when i woke up, i unbraided my hair, put a little conditioner on the ends and crown and voila!  my hair looked gorgeous.  it lasted for 6 days, and each day it got longer and fuller.  my boyfriend was happy :)  the product doesnt smell good at all, so dont expect a pleasant scent, but it fades quickly.  give it a try!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product for taming frizzy, curly hair without leaving a heavy, stiff or flaky feel. I wish there were more of it, especially for the money.</li>
    <li> This product gave my 4b/4c hair great definition. I used it with Carols Daughter Hair Milk Original Leave In Moisturizer. Unfortunately, after my hair dried, it was super dry. If I buy this product again, I will contact Carols Daughter to get a recommendation on what to use with this product to make my hair moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (01/2014): Another Reviewer (thank you, thank you, thank you!!!) sent me a great tip: Add oil to hair then apply this product. So, I recently (December 2013) applied the Carols Daughter Hair Milk Original Leave in Moisturizer on my hair, next I applied Olive Oil, then the CD Hair Milk Pudding. And VOILA, it worked (first I washed my hair and left it a little wet with water before applying anything!) I am now a happy camper. Since there&#x27;s wheat germ oil in CD Hair Milk Original Leave In Moisturizer (wheat germ has protein and I&#x27;m protein sensitive), I will use these CD products for one week, then use my non-protein MOISTURIZING products the following week, and continue to alternate in this pattern. I&#x27;m so happy this Hair Milk Pudding worked because I love, love, love, love, love Carols Daughter!</li>
    <li> Was not impressed with this product at all. Not at all on par with what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Carol&#x27;s Daughter products. Product did not define or moisturize curls.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair. most days I straighten it, some days I like to scrunch my hair and go natural. This milk is for those days. It keeps my fine, wavy hair from getting frizzy in my humid climate and truly holds the style you put in your hair. Perfect beach waves, ladies. I get so many compliments when I don&#x27;t straighten my hair and no one can tell I put any product in.  Plus it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look wet and crunchy, like when you scrunch with mousse without blow drying. Smells a little bit like an older lady but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger. A little bit GOES A LONG WAY. Too much and your hair LOOKS like it has mousse in it without the crunchiness. I love this product and it is now my go-to summer hair styling tool.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my curls frizz freeze without making them crunchy, my new favorite product, better than mouse or gel</li>
    <li> I can see that this would be good for some people but it just didn&#x27;t work out for me.  I have highlighted wavy/curly hair and I think this would be good for someone with thick curly/curly hair.  I really like the texture of this, it is pudding.  I wish it had been a good choice for me.</li>
    <li> 4c hair, i did a twist out with it and i had the most shine and definition! my hair was bouncy and i received alot of compliments it really does a great job holding hair.</li>
    <li> This is all I use with my damp hair. Keeps it smooth, without frizz, not fuzzy, not sticky. Leaves it flexible, shiny and soft to the touch. It&#x27;s the best anti frizz product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> My little girls hair would look nice for the first 2 hours and then it would look dry and brittle again. The moisture for the curls seems to last only when the hair is wet.&lt;br /&gt;It smells okay but I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this again as it does not moisturize like I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> Today is was 3rd day using Carol Daughter&#x27;s Hair Milk Pudding. First time (Sunday) I used it to twist &amp; knot freshly shampoo&#x27;d damp hair. It left my hair soft with no product residue, but my twist-out was immediately fuzzy. Monday night, I sectioned &amp; lightly misted my hair &amp; coated each section with the pudding - same fuzzy results. Last night, I applied it to dry sections, twisted and knotted - same fuzzy results. I have 4A hair, if that helps. For MY hair, it&#x27;s more like a daily hair dressing.</li>
