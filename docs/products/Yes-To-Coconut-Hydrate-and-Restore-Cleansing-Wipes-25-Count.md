      <li>I am able to remove most of my makeup but not all.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of these, but the packaging isn&#x27;t great, they don&#x27;t pull out very well as singles.</li>
      <li>u can use it all over ur body to rinse able</li>
      <li>The ULTIMATE BEST wipes in the world!!</li>
      <li>I love these wipes.</li>
      <li>I love that they have a top that snaps</li>
      <li>Cucumber/Coconut wipes much more than that of the Yes to Grapefruit wipes.</li>
      <li>These are great for times when I don&#x27;t have enough time to wash my face with water and cleanser or when I just need to freshen up during the day.</li>
      <li>This face wipe is by far superior.</li>
      <li>More importantly, these do a great job of gently removing my make-up, including eye make-up, and leaving my skin feeling fresh and super soft.</li>
      <li>If you want your face to feel clean and moisturized then this is the product you want to use.</li>
      <li>Cleans makeup off nicely, leaves my face soft.</li>
      <li>It also didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and had a nice smell.</li>
      <li>This product really did make me feel so much better about myself.</li>
      <li>These work well for my combination skin, leaving it soft and nicely balanced, with no sticky residue as some wipes can.</li>
      <li>and I may stay committed and loyal to these face wipes.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a facial wipe that cleanses better, consider Blum Naturals Exfoliating wipe, which has little beads that help clean -- and it also has a great orange scent.</li>
      <li>These are great facial wipes -- but can be used for more than just the face; I sometimes use several as a quick clean-up when there isn&#x27;t enough time to shower.</li>
      <li>Get ready to smell like super coconut face.</li>
      <li>Smells 100% of Coconut and leaves skin super soft!!!</li>
      <li>These wipes are highly recommended!!  </li>
      <li>I love the entire Yes to family of products.  </li>
      <li>I love using facial wipes, so I gave these a try.</li>
      <li>But otherwise, they take off grime gently and smell like a tropical vacation!</li>
      <li>This stuff and clean &amp; clear has completely cleared my acne and my acne was BAADDD.</li>
      <li>I use them occasionally instead of washing my face, since these are the fastest and easiest way to clean your face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll put them in my car so we can use to keep our hands cleaned, but won&#x27;t be using near our faces anymore!</li>
      <li>My skin is often sensitive but there were no issues with these wipes.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin either.  </li>
      <li>My skin can be sensitive and prone to breakouts, but these have never caused any skin irritation or breakouts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them a few times to remove my make up and my husband has used them to clean his face before going to bed and our eyes stung.</li>
      <li>I live in Colorado (extremely dry climate) and I have older drying skin, but these wipes did not agree with my complexion.</li>
      <li>They leave my face feeling fresh, not tight and dried out.</li>
      <li>These are just fine face wipes, but the coconut is a little powerful, to say the least.</li>

<li> Personally, these are the best I have found so far because they didn&#x27;t make me break out or have a terrible allergic reaction like other wipes have done, but they did contribute to turning my face red.</li>
<li> At 25 wipes a packet, they can last you about a month if you only use one a day, or even double that if you cut them in half.</li>
<li> then 30 sec later, ohhhh, my face started burning!  </li>
<li> These were a bit harsh on sensitive skin, but leave you feeling well moisturized.</li>
<li> They help my dry skin.  </li>
<li> The wipes stay moist for at least a couple of months in the packaging, as long as you carefully close the inner tab to seal it shut.</li>
<li> guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not really advertised as a face wipe!</li>
<li> Im going to try some of their other stuff too...</li>
<li> As I was trying to remove my liner and mascara, the skin around my eyes really started to burn, which I thought was weird for a makeup</li>
<li> These wipes are a little irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> While these wipes are less drying, they made my skin break out.</li>
<li> They become harsh on your skin if you scrub.</li>
<li> dont want to give a bad review maybe its just my skin...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Get ready to smell like super coconut face. These are just fine face wipes, but the coconut is a little powerful, to say the least.</li>
    <li> Back 2 nature with this coconut and kunut hydrating wipes is all u need 2 freshen up u can use it all over ur body to rinse able too&lt;br /&gt;Luv it</li>
    <li> These were a bit harsh on sensitive skin, but leave you feeling well moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love the entire Yes to family of products.  These wipes deliver hydration just as promised.  They also smell amazing.</li>
    <li> Smells and works GREAT.</li>
    <li> I bought them as make up removers based on an online recommendation. They do a great job at removing makeup, but I feel the wipe itself is a lot thinner than the Neutrogena ones I also bought. I&#x27;ve used them a few times to remove my make up and my husband has used them to clean his face before going to bed and our eyes stung. As I was trying to remove my liner and mascara, the skin around my eyes really started to burn, which I thought was weird for a makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to re-read the notes on the package, and surprise, you are supposed to keep this product away from your eyes... guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not really advertised as a face wipe! I&#x27;ll put them in my car so we can use to keep our hands cleaned, but won&#x27;t be using near our faces anymore!</li>
    <li> None of the cleansing wipes do an amazing job with waterproof eye makeup, but this one does better than most. It also didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and had a nice smell. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Much smaller than the grapefruit and not textured like it either. Smells good.</li>
    <li> Smell amazing, get all the makeup off your face easily. Also took these on vacation and carried them in my beach bag to wipe off sweat and refresh my face in the heat. Can&#x27;t wait to buy some more!</li>
    <li> This face wipe is by far superior. If you want your face to feel clean and moisturized then this is the product you want to use. Im going to try some of their other stuff too...</li>
    <li> I love using facial wipes, so I gave these a try. They don&#x27;t smell as coconutty as I would like, but that also means the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering. At 25 wipes a packet, they can last you about a month if you only use one a day, or even double that if you cut them in half. Personally, these are the best I have found so far because they didn&#x27;t make me break out or have a terrible allergic reaction like other wipes have done, but they did contribute to turning my face red. If I find a brand that doesn&#x27;t turn my face, I will immediately switch over, but until then these are my number one choice!</li>
    <li> These wipes are a little irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite cleansing face wipes. They don&#x27;t sting my face. They help my dry skin.  I always buy them over again.</li>
    <li> I love everything coconut, so I definitely love the scent of these. More importantly, these do a great job of gently removing my make-up, including eye make-up, and leaving my skin feeling fresh and super soft. My skin can be sensitive and prone to breakouts, but these have never caused any skin irritation or breakouts. I absolutely love them! :)</li>
    <li> The ULTIMATE BEST wipes in the world!! Smells 100% of Coconut and leaves skin super soft!!!</li>
    <li> very nice, smell great!</li>
    <li> They smell great but my skin stings when I used these wipes...dont want to give a bad review maybe its just my skin...</li>
    <li> Yes, yes, yes!  I am a beauty product junkie.  I will try everything.  Guess what? These actually work and I may stay committed and loyal to these face wipes.  After use, my face did feel softer, more hydrated and the smell was refreshing.  Actually I LOVE these and now my daughter appears to be sneaking them, so time for another order!</li>
    <li> These Yes to Coconut wipes have a delicious, tropical coconut scent, just like the rest of the Yes to Coconuts line. These are great facial wipes -- but can be used for more than just the face; I sometimes use several as a quick clean-up when there isn&#x27;t enough time to shower. I use them occasionally instead of washing my face, since these are the fastest and easiest way to clean your face. These work well for my combination skin, leaving it soft and nicely balanced, with no sticky residue as some wipes can. My skin is often sensitive but there were no issues with these wipes. The wipes stay moist for at least a couple of months in the packaging, as long as you carefully close the inner tab to seal it shut. They are made in the USA. These wipes are highly recommended!!  I prefer the scents of the Yes to Cucumber/Coconut wipes much more than that of the Yes to Grapefruit wipes. If you&#x27;re looking for a facial wipe that cleanses better, consider Blum Naturals Exfoliating wipe, which has little beads that help clean -- and it also has a great orange scent.</li>
    <li> I will only ever use &amp;#34;Yes to&amp;#34; products. This stuff and clean &amp; clear has completely cleared my acne and my acne was BAADDD. This product really did make me feel so much better about myself. And it smells good!</li>
    <li> While these wipes are less drying, they made my skin break out. I live in Colorado (extremely dry climate) and I have older drying skin, but these wipes did not agree with my complexion.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of these, but the packaging isn&#x27;t great, they don&#x27;t pull out very well as singles. Easy fix is to put them in a baggie! But otherwise, they take off grime gently and smell like a tropical vacation!</li>
    <li> Great for travel for a quick face wash and does not irritate my perioral dermatitis.</li>
    <li> Works nice. Definitely is coconut. Cleans makeup off nicely, leaves my face soft.</li>
    <li> I like the say yes to products. The wipes are nice hydrating wipes. I am able to remove most of my makeup but not all. They become harsh on your skin if you scrub. The smell is very nice.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes. They leave my face feeling fresh, not tight and dried out.</li>
    <li> These are great wipes! I like the scent as well as the packaging. I love that they have a top that snaps shut rather then the sticky piece that seals the package since those don&#x27;t seem to create enough of a seal. The lid is actually part of the reason I picked this product over another one. These are great for times when I don&#x27;t have enough time to wash my face with water and cleanser or when I just need to freshen up during the day.</li>
    <li> Made my face burn!! I was raving about how good it smelled and then 30 sec later, ohhhh, my face started burning!  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin either.  The burn did stop though as soon as I rinsed my skin with water.  I can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
