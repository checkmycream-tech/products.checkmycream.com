      <li>i love it ..</li>
      <li>I love all the Two-Faced Teddy Bear brushes.</li>
      <li>I wanted this smaller powder brush because of it&#x27;s size - perfect for travel!</li>
      <li>I use this for my blush, powder, and buffing, definitely gives an airbrush finish and leaves my make-up looking flawless.</li>
      <li>Many makeup brushes have caused me to break out.</li>
      <li>but I like these even better.  </li>
      <li>love love love</li>
      <li>i love this brush!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I clean it once a week and it stays nice.</li>
      <li>(I believe I placed the order on a Sunday) and when I opened up the box I was so excited to start using the brush!  </li>
      <li>I washed mine first in baby shampoo and warm water.  </li>
      <li>Overall, happy with the service and more so happy with this super soft and super cute brush.</li>
      <li>Beautiful and so soft, really recommend</li>
      <li>Applies well and even spread, soft, and cute!  </li>
      <li>Not for animal cruelty, technically the hair on this brush is only from a teddy bear, lol!  </li>
      <li>This is a great little brush.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i had a cheap face brush prior and it didn&#x27;t make my makeup look this smooth!</li>
      <li>Came right on time.</li>
      <li>The whole process of placing my order and receiving the brush took no time at all!  </li>
      <li>(I always make that mistake, I never learn!), but I splurged on this brush initially because it was so cute and man the quality is</li>
      <li>Super soft brush!</li>
      <li>I highly reccomend this product to women who like to pamper themselves.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it is so soft and puts the powder on very evenly..</li>
      <li>These fibers pick up powder like a magnet and distribute it smoothly and softly across your skin with absolutely NO prickly or scratchy feeling.</li>
      <li>rather expensive, but if you would like a nice brush this is worth the investment.   </li>
      <li>it has are SUPER SOFT, I recommend anyone who is just starting make up like me, or is a professional to have this brush.</li>
      <li>Have only used for 2 weeks but love the soft feel and the way it distributes both loose and cake power.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Very soft and applies my powder foundation evenly and without any irritation.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s so amazingly soft!</li>
      <li>This is by far the softest makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It distributes my powder foundation so well and minimizes powder lost, so that my foundation will last me so much longer.</li>
      <li>Even my MAC brushes are not as soft as this one is.  </li>
      <li>This brush is a soft and efficient luxury, to use on my skin.</li>
      <li>It is as soft as the descrition says.  </li>
      <li>Teddy Bear Hair is unbelievably soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so so soft and blends the bronzer without messing up my blush.</li>
      <li>it was run down but STILL somehow super soft.  </li>
      <li>even if price is higher than other brushes, quality is what I look for!</li>
      <li>Which, by the way, costs HALF as much as the &#x27;pro&#x27; brushes!    </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed in other high-end synthetic powder brushes I&#x27;ve tried due to the uncomfortable &#x27;scratchy-ness&#x27; of the bristle fibers, but not Too Faced.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been obsessed ever since.</li>

    <li> This is by far the softest makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I bought it to use with Too Faced&#x27;s Primed and Poreless powder, and the brush applies this product evenly and well. My only complaint is that I need to use more of the powder than I do with similar products, and I&#x27;m honestly not sure if that&#x27;s because of the powder or the brush...I think both. I need to try this brush with another powder product and see what happens.</li>
    <li> The whole process of placing my order and receiving the brush took no time at all!  Before I realized, the brush was sent out the same day (I believe I placed the order on a Sunday) and when I opened up the box I was so excited to start using the brush!  I washed mine first in baby shampoo and warm water.  I have used the brush to apply translucent powder.  Even my MAC brushes are not as soft as this one is.  I have seen someone use this for blush/bronzer but I haven not tried that.  Overall, happy with the service and more so happy with this super soft and super cute brush.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Not for animal cruelty, technically the hair on this brush is only from a teddy bear, lol!  But no really, I first felt this brush at a Sephora and being the display brush it was run down but STILL somehow super soft.  I&#x27;ve been obsessed ever since. Bought one for me and my best friend!  Softest brush, even when dirty, even when it&#x27;s aged (Not that I would know) :)  Applies well and even spread, soft, and cute!  great buy! rather expensive, but if you would like a nice brush this is worth the investment.   Put that CVS Powder brush in the trash ladies!</li>
    <li> i love it .. just dont love the price tag!</li>
    <li> The Too Faced powder pouf brush is hands-down the best powder brush I have ever owned. It is made of what they call &#x27;Teddy Bear Hair&#x27; - synthetic fibers that are softer than any pro brush I&#x27;ve tried! These fibers pick up powder like a magnet and distribute it smoothly and softly across your skin with absolutely NO prickly or scratchy feeling. I&#x27;ve been disappointed in other high-end synthetic powder brushes I&#x27;ve tried due to the uncomfortable &#x27;scratchy-ness&#x27; of the bristle fibers, but not Too Faced. Which, by the way, costs HALF as much as the &#x27;pro&#x27; brushes!    As no two people are alike, I suggest making a visit to your local Ulta or pro beauty supply store to do a hands-on comparison before you purchase online. I&#x27;m so thankful I did, as I was considering a Smashbox brush until I discovered Too Faced. You can find all the pertinent product details on the Too Faced site: [...]     Cheers!</li>
    <li> I love all the Two-Faced Teddy Bear brushes. This one is no exception. I wanted this smaller powder brush because of it&#x27;s size - perfect for travel!</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  It is as soft as the descrition says.  I was a Sephora Pro Brush user but I like these even better.  I&#x27;m definitely switching!</li>
    <li> Super soft brush! Love it! Came right on time. Great buy</li>
    <li> I have other brushes by Too Faced Cosmetics (same style) and I needed bigger face brush... Did not think twice about brand or product.. will buy again... even if price is higher than other brushes, quality is what I look for! Great product!!</li>
    <li> This brush is divine and lives up to all the great reviews.  Teddy Bear Hair is unbelievably soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed. I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a year now and it looks great, washes well, and applies makeup so beautifully.  I use it for applying powder, bronzer and blush.</li>
