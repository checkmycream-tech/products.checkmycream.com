<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference. Maybe with more use</li>
    <li> I love it, it smells great. I care about my hair like it&#x27;s my baby and this stuff works really well with my hair. I use it with amino acids and it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
    <li> This conditioner and the shampoo are miracle workers for my hair.  I am African American and I do not have a perm I press my hair.  A friend of mine bought the conditioner for me after telling her that my hair was breaking and falling out.  I tried the conditioner and after using it for two weeks I notice that the breakage to my hair had decreased.  My hair is also growing I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Really works for dry, coarse hair. After the first use, made my hair soft and manageable and I also noticed less shedding. Best product I ever used and will be committed to buying it again in the future.</li>
    <li> seems to work for shedding. just started using it, anxious to see the true results, but i like it so far</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> it really works, no more shredding of my hair this is a must have for your hair.</li>
    <li> This product far exceeded my expectations! I have SLE Lupus &amp; my hair tends to shed. Recently I noticed way more shedding than usual, so, I decided to give this garlic mask/hot oil treatment a try. It&#x27;s a little thicker than conditioner &amp; smells nice (nothing like garlic). It has a cooling effect on the scalp &amp; melts away tangles &amp; knots (definitely a bonus to naturals with kinky, curly &amp; coily hair). I allowed the product to sit in my hair for about 45 mins (NO heat), rinsed, and I BE DARNED.... After detangling, I may have had 6-10 shed hairs vs 100-200. Creator is my witness that this stuff works immediately! Alter Ego Garlic Mask is now on my holy grail list. I use it once per week prior to my DC session. I love this product so much, I bought the bigger size with the pump!! A must have for anyone with hair :-)</li>
    <li> I really like this product! It leaves my hair soft and manageable. Am on my third jar. I have see change since I use this product. My hair was folling off due to child birth but after I use it is better.</li>
    <li> I tried it and it lessened hair shedding, it also did not stink as badly as using real garlic but it also worked a bit less than the stinky real thing  (to make real garlic for hair shedding, put around 16 mashed up cloves in 1 c of extra virgin olive oil, put on hair and scalp (scalp specifically) baggy, get under the dryer for at least 30 minutes or more than take off, and cleanse hair--so this 3 times a week if you are experiencing hair shedding that is not due to meds, or illness or hair pulling.</li>
    <li> im natural and this is all i use after i shampoo and it gets all the knots and leaves my hair soft.. yea im african american with 4 type hair</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product when I went to a Dominican hair salon they used this in my natural 4a/4b hair.  After they rinsed it out my hair detangled like a dream, and my blow out looked amazing and lasted for a few weeks.  I also noticed my hair did not shed as much after the salon trip.  I decided to buy this product to use at home.  I just shampoo my hair then use the garlic mask as a deep condition with a plastic cap on my head for 30 minutes.  The conditioner gives a cooling tingly feeling to your scalp which I like.  After I wash the product out the tangles I used to have when I used other conditioners are nonexistent! When I blow dry and flat iron my hair, my hair get so much more straighter and has more bounce to it as well.  I love this deep conditioner and will be buying a larger size since I just ran out of this.</li>
    <li> Great Product it made my hair super soft. I LOVE it I will continue to buy this product!!!! Thanks U</li>
    <li> I had really bad shedding in my hair and my mom recomemded that i try this product. After 4 uses the shedding has stopped completely. Took to my hair stylist for her to use and she was impressed and tried it also. This product is no apart of my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t like it.not much diffrence.there are butter masks in the market.make my hair dry.didn&#x27;t worked for me.wast of money</li>
    <li> I AM AMAZED! after onky one use my hair looks fuller and feels softer.  My husband notices the difference as well as my coworkers.  This product is a must have by  women, you will love it and keep going back for more</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work even a little in stopping hair loss garlic supplements capsules seem to work better</li>
    <li> This product is light and creamy and has a descent fragrance. It does not smell like garlic. I did use this treatment in combination with a garlic shampoo but my excessive shedding is completely over. It only took about two weeks and six washes. My shedding was very excessive.</li>
    <li> I expected my hair to softer  based on the reviews, but that wasn&#x27;t the case for me. I  have seen less shedding though so that  is great. I will  provide further updates as I continue to use the product. N.B I have black hair.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product.  I did not notice any benefit.  My hair seemed dry and undernourished after I rinsed it out.  Definitely did not have a silky feeling.  Matter of fact it was tangled and dry.  I also used the cordless thermal turban as the heat wrap with this.  Neither did a good job.  I would not buy this again but will use it again (along with another produce) since I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product twice.  So far I have not notice much different in my hair shedding.  I will use the product a few more times and hopefully I will see a difference.</li>
    <li> Not understanding why my hair was shedding, I became reluctantly everyday to put a comb through it.  I researched Google, for some kind of solution.  I came across this blog that addressed my need for answers. The blogger, recommended this product. I was desperate for something. I decided to see if Amazon, carried this product.  I just received my product on 6/8/15. After shampooing with some WEN I used the Alter Ego Garlic Mask Hot Oil Treatment on my hair and let it remain on for (4) hours.  :) :): :) :) :)! I&#x27;m so happy to report the shedding is OMG! so much less.  I look forward to being a continued customer and trying other items of this line.  Thank you! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my co-worker recommended it for my thinning edges. I have not used it as a hot oil treatment but I use it as a hair conditioner. I like this because it leaves my hair soft and smelling good. It only takes a little so the jar seems to last forever. I would buy this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have strong garlic smell, which was a concern of mine. 16.9 goes very fast! Great item. Didn&#x27;t make my hair instantly stop shedding, but its a great product to have.</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what it said and I could see a difference in the my hair shedding the first time I used it! It arrived on time and was just as advertised. I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this product from the first time my hairdresser used it on my hair many years ago. It leaves my hair looking and feeling good.</li>
    <li> Alter Ego&#x27;s Garlic hot oil treatment leave my hair so soft and manageable; it is unbelievable.  I am a huge Alter Ego fan and there products have not let me down; this product included.  The hot oil treatment can be used as a deep conditioner or as simply was it out after shampooing.  I&#x27;ve used it on my hair while it was relaxed and use it now that it is natural; it still leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this product! prompt delivery! My hair stylist and others have noticed a difference in my hair!</li>
    <li> This product is top of the line for healthy hair growth should be applied at least once a month for long-term results.</li>
    <li> Being using this for years.</li>
    <li> Came brand new with the plastic wrap and everything. It has a good scent to it and it&#x27;s good for the hair</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product that reduce hair shedding.  I have been using Alter Ego Garlic Hot Mask Oil Treatment for years and it keeps my hair so healthy.  I purchased this jar for my mother &amp; she loves it.  In fact; her hairdresser is going to start using this on her other clients.  Oh, it does not smell like garlic.....The smell is different, but in a good way.  Highly recommend especially if you have an issue with hair shedding.</li>
    <li> my fine hair is super soft just after 1 usage.. not sure if it helps with hair fall yet.. only been using twice. i hope it will. i love the texture and smell</li>
    <li> The shipping was decent, packaging was very good really helped with my shedding. I bought this for my shedding, it makes my hair very soft, shiny and moisturized. Glad I tried it, if you are having shedding issues give it a try. By the second time I used it NO MORE SHEDDING OR BREAKAGE!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing treatment..leaves ur hair soft and pretty</li>
    <li> Works well for my wife she will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> Works wonders to stop shedding, also makes hair look healthy and smell good, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> You can use your favorite shampoo, and put this in your hair, i mean it detangles right away. Makes the hair very soft, vibrant, healthy. If I want to wear my hair wavy, I just wash put the mask on and leave this on. My hair was horrible, not healthy looking, until I came across Alter ego. I wear all of there products. There follicle treatments are pretty good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product and will order more. It does what it says, my hair is natural with the exception of my highlights. In the winter it gets dry and I experience a lot of shedding. This seems to be helping with that. And it does not smell like garlic. Can someone recommend a good hydrating Dominican condish w/o mineral oils?</li>
    <li> The product is awesome it really help alleviate hair shedding but the lid never sealed  completely. It turns and never seals.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product just love it! If u can keep it for a little longer than 15 minutes works even better...... I wrapped my hair with the product on and vacuum my house .... That Gave me amazing&lt;br /&gt; results... Just get it and try!!!!</li>
    <li> I only used this product twice and both times a massive amount of hair came out after the treatment was washed out of my hair.  I was using it to STOP my hair loss and all it did was make it worse.  Now it is too late for me to return it.</li>
    <li> I wish I could return it but ive already opened it. My hair wasn&#x27;t any different after using it</li>
    <li> I am all about deep conditioners but this one did NOT go well with my hair. I don&#x27;t know if it is the garlic or what not but my hair shed. Even as I was applying it in sections and detangling it, it shed way more than usual. I am happy I bought a small jar because I gave the rest to my mom, which it worked wonders for her. So this just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Like the reviews said it does not smell bad it is very nice it keeps your hair soft I would recommend and buy again</li>
    <li> i bought this product for a friend that lives out of the USA and she loves it,i buy it at lest every 6 months, she told me she uses it once a week and it last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;My friend has long curly hair and she says it works perfect for her.</li>
    <li> I use this maske as recommended by my stylist.  It leaves my hair silky and shiney of coaurse. I usually apply in the shower place a conditioning cap on, then rinse when im done with my washing (not to gross anyone out here ). Your hair will be soft and healthy after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really into my hair and I&#x27;ve tried just about every product out there. I have thicker, long, naturally curly hair that I blow dry straight weekly. I purchased this product based on a recommendation from my sister (who always has shiny, soft hair) and I&#x27;m in love with it. I use it after shampooing, let it sit for 15+ minutes and then wash out (I do not use any other conditioner when I use this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results? I&#x27;ve used this product 4 times so far and my hair is incredibly soft and my split ends are basically non-existent. It has also shortened my blow dry time significantly. Since I blow dry my hair so much, I was looking for a product that would help combat the damage that I know very well that i&#x27;m causing and I think this is that product. Some reviewers have mentioned combining this product with heat as it sits--I tried sitting under a blow-dryer with this treatment in my hair and I didn&#x27;t notice a significant enough difference to warrant doing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Smells great (does NOT smell like garlic...yay)&lt;br /&gt;- Makes my hair super easy to blow out (shaved off about 20 minutes from my blow dry routine)&lt;br /&gt;- Works on just about every hair type. (I&#x27;ve suggested this product to several friends who have all loved it)&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts a while (a little goes a long way)&lt;br /&gt;- Rinses out easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Best results if left in hair for 15+ minutes. So, it&#x27;s not quick.&lt;br /&gt;- I honestly couldn&#x27;t think of any other cons :)</li>
    <li> Smells great, left my hair so soft, shiny and silky. I would try it with hot towel to see if I can get a different result.</li>
    <li> Hair breakage from a relaxer. It didn&#x27;t help with the breakage at all. It just made my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair silky soft. Does exactly as described. I like to leave it in for a few hours. Makes my hair feel like perfection! Fast shipping. I would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  great price. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I got this because my daughter was complaining about excess shedding.  Kids were picking hairs off her clothes at school all day.  She would also stand by the trash and pull several hairs out frequently during the day.  She has been using this a few times a week and has noticed improvement in shedding, even in the first week.  She is also taking garlic supplements.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the best, so she uses her regular conditioner afterwards to remove the scent.</li>
    <li> Great for my dry, color treated hair.  My hair drinks it up. Very helpful when detangling my hair.</li>
    <li> I also likes the way it makes my hair feels</li>
    <li> I lost a lot my hair and using this product, it&#x27;s getting better&lt;br /&gt;it smells good, and gives flexibility to my Hair</li>
    <li> Great for all hair types and I love it, hair feels great when I use it for a while.</li>
    <li> Waste, did not do anything</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this was excellent like all of the other reviews. it was just an average conditioner. Nothing special at least on my dry hair type.</li>
    <li> I have natural 4C hair and this treatment works immediately if my hair starts to shed or feel brittle. I shampoo and condition, then use this a deep condition. I distribute evenly on my hair, put on a plastic cap, and use my Hair Therapy Heating Cap. I let it sit for about 20 minutes or until my heating cap is no longer warm, rinse and add a leave in conditioner. My hair stops shedding IMMEDIATELY. Lifelong customer here!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair extremely soft and I have very coarse hair. Really worth it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Works very well leaves my hair very soft and I often add castor or and avocado oil to increase the moisture but no complaints I will buy again</li>
    <li> Love love love what this does for my hair. It stopped the shedding &amp; gives my hair a salon look and feel when used with the shampoo. This &amp; the shampoo will remain staple products in my hair arsenal....</li>
    <li> Made my hair strong , I love this stuff, my hair loves this stuff. The best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> I found this product through a relaxed hair care blog and I have to say it lives up to hype. It has a pleasant scent and it makes my hair soft and shiny. Most importantly it dramatically cuts back on the shedding and protects my ends. It works great on its own or mixed in other conditioners and castor oil.</li>
