      <li>Great add-on price</li>

      <li>Very strong, fake-grapefruit/disinfectant smell that i don&#x27;t find pleasant .  </li>

      <li>Love, love these wipes.</li>

      <li>I love how it smells</li>
      <li>I love them and have used them for years without incident.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m one of those people who doesn&#x27;t like most cosmetic and perfumy smells at all.</li>
      <li>I love Neutrogena products, but I won&#x27;t be buying these grapefruit-scented wipes again.</li>
      <li>I originally bought these wipes for my own use.</li>
      <li>I thought, great brand, pink grapefruit is nice (when bath and body works does it) and for acne prone skin!  </li>
      <li>This is probably less effective than soap and water, but it is the best solution for someone like myself who always forgets to wash my makeup off until I am in bed.</li>
      <li>I love the scent, texture, and light cleansing abilities of these cloths.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and to dispose.  </li>
      <li>So far good ole Equate( off brand version of Ponds) seems to be top choice for me.</li>
      <li>It is true that they are better than nothing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;People complain about the smell, but I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>That said, they seem to work just fine.  </li>
      <li>These cleansing wipes smell really great and are strong enough to remove waterproof makeup.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re traveling and need to minimize your liquids, these are fantastic.</li>
      <li>; cannot find this cheap in any store.</li>
      <li>and they work great as a facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>They keep her face free of pimples.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The initial smell of the wipe is good, but once it touches your skin, it changes into a more rancid version of some sort of mystery citrus fruit.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one of those overly sensitive to odor types of people, I have my fair share of perfumes but these are gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They help keep their skin clean and acne free.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try these wipes -- but I have to say, I don&#x27;t care for the scent at all.  </li>
      <li>first off, the smell is overwhelming.</li>
      <li>My skin is fairly normal (not oily), so I can&#x27;t weigh in on how effective they are at oil control.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even comment on how the wipes clean, since I immediately tossed the wipe I had in my hand and will not be using them again.</li>
      <li>They clean well, are not drying and you feel all dewy when you&#x27;re done.</li>
      <li>They leave your skin squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>My current favorite is the rose-scented kind from Forever 21.</li>
      <li>They really clean my face and keep acne under control.</li>
      <li>I was excited to use them and ready to love them until I smelled them.  </li>
      <li>I wanted something that was geared more towards adults and not so much for the pizza faced teens.  </li>
      <li>I bought these for my daughter thinking they would smell sweet.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer said, the fragrance is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>I was quickly over-powered by this odor and thought I would give it some time, maybe the smell would quickly dissipate...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments about how smooth my face looks, how young my skin is.  </li>
      <li>wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also interested in the Pink Grapefruit body wash, because strong fragrance is more suitable for your body than on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This particular kind sting my eyes slightly if I really try to scrub my mascara off.</li>
      <li>I opened them up, eager for a clean face after spending time camping, and was very upset when my face turned bright red and began to burn.</li>
      <li>The grapefruit scent is strong and you can really feel it working on your skin.  </li>
      <li>the more you dry out your face, the more oily your face gets to replace all the moisture in your skin.</li>
      <li>excellent* quality, very thick and moist.</li>
      <li>&quot; I wonder if it&#x27;s even safe to use them near your eyes, with all the alcohol in them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t smell fresh or citrusy or grapefruity; they just smell chemicaly.  </li>
      <li>They smell just like a fresh grapefruit.</li>
      <li>i was looking for a facial clenser to clean my face and remove my makeup its really great for facial makeup and cleans your skin terrifically!!</li>
      <li>After the gym, in my car, on vacation, they keep my skin clean and i love the smell, especially in the morning.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
      <li>I am really into grapefruit scent and when i found these I was really excited.  </li>
      <li>They do clean your face, but the smell is a bit much for a kid, and me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter thinking they would smell sweet. They smell awful and the smell lingers after you use it. They do clean your face, but the smell is a bit much for a kid, and me. We ended up returning them.</li>
    <li> I was really wanting to use these but 2 days into using these I now have a horrible rash on my whole neck, chest, shoulders and ears. It itches like crazy. I have sensitive skin but nothing has ever done this before.</li>
    <li> I like Neutrogena, have been using their products my whole life. I use the grapefruit face wash , so it seemed a no - brainer to use the wipes.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package I had second thoughts. The fragrance is VERY INTENSE. Also unpleasant. Only vaguely like grapefruit, with a very musty and acrid component. Hard to describe. Scent is a very subjective thing, but hard to believe anyone would find this appealing.&lt;br /&gt;Still I used several times. The wipes are large and very soft, and remove even stubborn makeup. Not drying at all. I&#x27;d love them if they smelled good&lt;br /&gt;, but not only do I dislike the smell it really lingers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tested a number of different wipes in an attempt to find a favorite, and this is definitely not it. The wipes themselves work well enough to remove oil &amp; dirt from the skin but, as the title says, the scent is absolutely overpowering. I didn&#x27;t mind the smell at first, but then I noticed it would not go away and, after a while, began to actually make me nauseous. The only time I used it, I had to re-wash my face with soap and a washcloth just to get rid of the smell. I threw away the rest of the pack because I couldn&#x27;t imagine using these again. I keep a pack of wipes at work for mid-day refreshes, but using these in that environment would stink up the entire office! Perhaps their other scents aren&#x27;t quite so pungent, but stay away from these.</li>
    <li> I purchased these at my local big box store.  I thought, great brand, pink grapefruit is nice (when bath and body works does it) and for acne prone skin!  Great!  There was even a coupon on the pack.  I was excited to use them and ready to love them until I smelled them.  I  got this wave of cat urine.  They were very acid smelling, and I just couldn&#x27;t put that on my face night after night!  I had to toss them and find a different brand.</li>
    <li> In one word, convenient.  I was pleasantly pleased by the lack of chemical residue I did not feel on my skin following the use of the product.</li>
    <li> I like grapefruit as much as the next person, but GEEZ!  these things smelled so much like grapefruit - and it lingered so long after you finsihed - that I could not wait to get rid of these.  I would never buy this scent again! Ugh.</li>
    <li> These work well, but have a very, very strong scent. My daughter doesn&#x27;t mind it, but I can&#x27;t use them due to the smell.</li>
    <li> So I bought these 2 days ago and so far not a problem, I out moisturizer after I use it and it doesn&#x27;t make my face all dry. Also there were complaints about it making the trash smell but all I smell is just plain grapefruit and that&#x27;s that we keep the restroom door closed so that our dogs do get in. Some will complain that it burns your eyes but if you were to read the directions, it says not to use around eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find the smell not as strong after I wring the extra liquid off the towelette. I have very sensitive skin and it does tingle/burn a bit but like I said, throw on a little moisturizer and its not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess after reading a million reviews of nothing but whining about stuff that can be fixed i got annoyed and had to write a review.</li>
    <li> these are tested on animals!  that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
    <li> They sting you&#x27;re eyes</li>
    <li> The subject says it all. These things stink. Between the alcohol and the worst grapefruit scent ever, these wipes will leave your face smelling like a gas station bathroom - sickly sweet air freshner with a dash of ammonia.</li>
    <li> I really like these but people with sensitive skin may not like it. Plan on keeping it in some type of air tight container after opening. It does seal well after opening. It will dry out if you don&#x27;t store it in an air tight container. I&#x27;m just using a ziplock baggy.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re traveling and need to minimize your liquids, these are fantastic. They are a bit abrasive, and I wouldn&#x27;t use them for every day use, but they do a great job exfoliating from time to time. They&#x27;re overpriced on Amazon - I got them for just $7.99 at a neighborhood grocery store in Maryland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, but as other reviewers say, it is a bit strong.</li>
    <li> As soon as I used the wipes my face turned red for 24 hours.  It felt like it was on fire and nothing I did to wash it off helped.  Absolutely no relief from the alcohol in it.</li>
    <li> Love theses wipes! They really clean my face and keep acne under control. Great add-on price; cannot find this cheap in any store. Need a bit of extra time for shipping though, so order a week ahead if you are running low...</li>
    <li> Man, I wish I could give it 0 Stars. I have acne prone skin so seeing it contained Salicylic Acid, I went ahead and bought it. When I opened the package, it smelled very nice but as soon as it hit my skin.. It felt as though my skin was on FIRE. The smell turned into an alcohol smell and made my eyes watery. I quickly wiped my whole face and as a result, it left my face extremely irritated, red, and very dry (the next day). I thought maybe i&#x27;ll get used to it so I used it for another 2 days, each time it left my face red, irritated and dry. Still smelling awful! Oh and it didn&#x27;t help/ control my acne at all, thanks to the wipes my skin broke out pretty bad. Please, those with combination acne-prone skin: DO NOT get these Neutrogena &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; wipes.</li>
    <li> I had bought different Neutrogena wipes in the past and have been very satisfied with them. Some time ago I tried the Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Facial Cleanser, Pink Grapefruit, and I loved it. So I though this would be as great, despise the reviews here...how wrong I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They serve their purpose, but the odor of this wipes is very intense and repulsive. This will stay on your hands and face for a while, not to mention the whole room. Also, if you get it on you eyes, this will very likely burn. So I will be sticking to the ones I already like. No more pink grapefruit for me.</li>
    <li> Love, love these wipes. They smell just like a fresh grapefruit. They clean well, are not drying and you feel all dewy when you&#x27;re done. I always hate to throw them out. I don&#x27;t understand all these negative reviews about the smell. It&#x27;s wonderful and I&#x27;m one of those people who doesn&#x27;t like most cosmetic and perfumy smells at all.</li>
    <li> Not for sensitive skin! Left abrasions on my face</li>
    <li> oh my jeezy peezy these things... I usually use the Neutrogena blue makeup removing wipes which are great and soothing, I use them at the end of the night to take off my makeup before washing my face so it&#x27;s extra clean. I have oily skin which is very prone to cystic acne. i decided to try out these ones. first off, the smell is overwhelming. Like an intensely flavored sour patch candy and it sticks to your face. the first thing I try to do is take off my eye makeup...while it did a decent job of getting my mascara off, my eyes stung and teared up and felt like they were on fire and under my eyes felt dry and rubbed raw. i&#x27;m not really allergic to anything and my skin isn&#x27;t really sensitive so I was surprised. I&#x27;d imagine this would be even worse on someone with sensitive skin... secondly, when using it on the rest of my face, it feels very drying, like using an alcohol wipe on my face.it didn&#x27;t smoothly slide over my skin, it dragged jaggedly along my face pulling my skin. my entire face burns and stings after I use it and I have trouble opening my eyes as the burning sensation makes them hurt and tear up and water. after I wash my face and put my moisturizer on it still feels dry..deep down dried out and irritated..never using this again. the more you dry out your face, the more oily your face gets to replace all the moisture in your skin.</li>
    <li> I am really into grapefruit scent and when i found these I was really excited.  They do have a lovely scent.  However, they are pricey which is the only downfall.</li>
    <li> i was looking for a facial clenser to clean my face and remove my makeup its really great for facial makeup and cleans your skin terrifically!! but be careful using it around your eyes!!!! i used it trying to remove my eye makeup and made my eyes burn and red...just dont use around eyes and youll be good!! :)</li>
    <li> These grapefruit cleansing wipes are nothing in comparison to the original makeup wipes in the blue package. The grapefruit scent is very light and also burnt my skin. I ended up throwing the package away, I didn&#x27;t even want to finish them.</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local drug store just to try it out.  I used it last night and immediately felt like my face was burning.  I quickly washed it off but the burning did not go away until later that night.  This morning, I woke up with a burning face yet again and a huge splotchy red mess!  It looks and feels like a sunburn. I even got a rash on my neck from where I rubbed it Hoping it goes away tomorrow. Will never be purchasing Neutrogena again.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter, but they irritated her face.  She prefers the Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive wipes.</li>
    <li> I hate these things. They were very strong and made my eyes swollen and red and they made my eyes tear up</li>
    <li> Neutrogena, enough said. Works as described, company is obviously very large and successful. Recommend for treating surface skin acne specifically.</li>
    <li> These wipes burn my skin when I use them. Not buying them again.</li>
    <li> My 13-year old daughter LOVES these wipes.  They are so simple and easy to use, and for a young teen to remember to do on a daily basis (morning and night).  They keep her face free of pimples. I bought the Wal-mart brand, of the grapefruit wipes, and they did not work for her.  So, I have to keep buying Neutrogena.  If she goes 1 day without using these wipes, I can tell a difference. These wipes are oil-free and the grapefruit really dries out any pimples trying to form.  I wouldn&#x27;t use on a dry face, but more of an oily face.  They keep her face SO CLEAR.  The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me or my daughter, but my husband says it stinks.</li>
    <li> I bought these in my local drug store because I love Neutrogena&#x27;s pink grapefruit facial scrub. I have also used their facial cleansing/makeup removing cloths and found them to work well. However, these pink grapefruit cloths were a mistake. I opened them up, eager for a clean face after spending time camping, and was very upset when my face turned bright red and began to burn. I turned the package over to find that alcohol was the second listed ingredient. I hadn&#x27;t even thought to check since alcohol is not in their other wipes, or in the pink grapefruit facial scrub. I can&#x27;t even comment on how the wipes clean, since I immediately tossed the wipe I had in my hand and will not be using them again. These are not for anyone with sensitive skin, or for anyone who hasn&#x27;t used a facial product with alcohol before. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have sensitive skin, since I use products containing salicylic acid, and have no problem with sensitivity. It&#x27;s been a few hours and my face is still a little pink and feels almost sunburned. I am just glad that I didn&#x27;t get too close to my eyes!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for acne prone or oily skin. My results, clear skin using it once in the morning and then again at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of citrus scents, particularly grapefruit.  And I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena [[ASIN:B002Z72REI Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Scrub, Pink Grapefruit, Value Size, 6.7 Ounce]] for sometime, with good results.  I was excited to try these wipes -- but I have to say, I don&#x27;t care for the scent at all.  They don&#x27;t smell fresh or citrusy or grapefruity; they just smell chemicaly.  That said, they seem to work just fine.  My skin is fairly normal (not oily), so I can&#x27;t weigh in on how effective they are at oil control.  I&#x27;ll stick with the Neutrogena scrub for use in the shower, but for wipes, I definitely prefer [[ASIN:B003Y6VVVE Ponds Ponds Wet Cleansing Towelettes Morning Refresh Towelettes]].</li>
    <li> I am a nomad sometimes. Between work and school and other obligations sometimes I don&#x27;t have all my beauty products with me. These wipes are awesome. After the gym, in my car, on vacation, they keep my skin clean and i love the smell, especially in the morning.</li>
    <li> I get these for my preteen daughter.  She loves them and they seem to help her with her face routine. I like that I can save a couple dollars buying from Amazon and with my Prime membership, they&#x27;re here fast!</li>
    <li> Does the job; and also has a nice scent.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> These things are DOUSED in alcohol and BURN my face! I only used 2 wipes and I will not be using anymore. They burn my face so bad it turns red and causes pain (and I&#x27;m not allergic to anything; the alcohol is just insane) I will be sticking to the regular neutrogena wipes.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, texture, and light cleansing abilities of these cloths. They&#x27;re just big enough that I can wash my face and chest after a yoga session, or if I happen to have worn makeup out to a party, they get it all off without needing more than a single cloth. Very convenient, and good for my skin too!</li>
    <li> Little towelettes that do a super job of removing makeup and refreshing face. Does not leave skin feeling like you have a film over your face like some do.</li>
    <li> I bought these for camping and all it did was make my face burn, and my eyes burn. I gave it to a friend and she had he same reaction, it then caused me to break out really badly (I never break out, knock on wood) will be throwing the rest away. Very bummed.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Easy to use and to dispose.  Neutrogena is a good company and it&#x27;s difficult to go wrong with them.</li>
    <li> I originally bought these wipes for my own use. However, the morning after using them, my face turned dark red and burned. I have pretty sensitive skin, and it must have caused a bad reaction. I tried them again several days later and got the same results, burning red skin. So I gave the package to my sisters. They LOVE them and have no problem with them at all.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena wipes smell very delicious (I mean come on, it&#x27;s pink grapefruit!) and they work great as a facial cleanser. I would definitely recommend buying!</li>
    <li> these facial wipes are ok.  leaves you skin feeling kinda funny and the grapefruit smell is almost too powerful.  will use these up but will not order again</li>
    <li> I purchased these from my local drugstore.  That night, I used one, and it stung, but whatever--I went to bed.  The next morning, my skin was red, dry, and flaky.  And I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin!  I don&#x27;t need to buy fragrance-free products, or anything like that, so I was surprised by my skin&#x27;s reaction.  I love Neutrogena products, but I won&#x27;t be buying these grapefruit-scented wipes again.</li>
    <li> Convenient, smells good, cleans well.</li>
    <li> I usually buy these wipes from my local grocery store. I really like the smell, but I can see why some wouldn&#x27;t. I feel like they work really well. I feel like they work so well that I alternate between sensitive skin wipes and these bad babies. This is probably less effective than soap and water, but it is the best solution for someone like myself who always forgets to wash my makeup off until I am in bed. This particular kind sting my eyes slightly if I really try to scrub my mascara off. If I don&#x27;t scrub too hard, this isn&#x27;t a problem. I never use these wipes without a moisturizer after. I really feel like they would dry out my face if used alone. My biggest pet peeve is that the sticker doesn&#x27;t last for the life of the bag. If you get lazy and do not seal them in a new container, you may dry out the remaining wipes easily.</li>
    <li> fan! I love how it smells (strong grapefruit smell for those sensitive to scents). he only thing I didnt like is that raw feeling after removing my eye makeup BUT its also very VERY waterproof and I have found that its best to use something oil based to get the liner off then follow up with a full face wash with these cloths....</li>
    <li> Product gets the makeup off, but it is so drying for my skin. When you throw the towel in the garbage it leaves a bad odor in the bathroom and it&#x27;s embarrassing.</li>
    <li> I thought these were working wonders but was mistaken. It is true that they are better than nothing. They are probably also good to carry with you to the gym, etc. For using at home in your bathroom, I have found SAL3 soap to work a lot better and be a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> So I bought these because I&#x27;m a 33 year old woman with a the T-Zone of a 15 year old.  I wanted something that was geared more towards adults and not so much for the pizza faced teens.  I thought Neutrogena would be a great alternative when shopping for drugstore face products.  I&#x27;m also a fan of anything that smells like Pink Grapefruit so I bought these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial smell of the wipe is good, but once it touches your skin, it changes into a more rancid version of some sort of mystery citrus fruit.  I was quickly over-powered by this odor and thought I would give it some time, maybe the smell would quickly dissipate...WRONG!  30 minutes of sitting on the couch and I can still smell my face and it&#x27;s not pleasant.  I&#x27;m not one of those overly sensitive to odor types of people, I have my fair share of perfumes but these are gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep getting the urge to get up and wash my face off because the scent is really over-powering.  My face also feels like cement has dried on it, it sort of itches and I can tell that whatever is on the wipe is too strong for my skin because it&#x27;s too dry...which in turn is going to cause my oil glands to go ape sh-.  I&#x27;m going to go wash my face, these wipes are junk.  I don&#x27;t recommend them at all.  They stink and they made my face feel like it&#x27;s going too crack off.</li>
    <li> I just tried it out tonight so I can&#x27;t review efficacy. Not sure if I will give them a long enough try to comment on how it works. The smell is SO BAD. It&#x27;s a mix of cat pee and dirty lady bits/ladies bathroom. Completely disgusting, it makes me gag.</li>
    <li> The grapefruit scent is strong and you can really feel it working on your skin.  Very nice...I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old and have had acne my entire life. Some products work but are very expensive (I cannot afford the $75 a month \\&quot;kits\\&quot; to keep my skin clear anymore).  These are GREAT for cleaning your skin.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments about how smooth my face looks, how young my skin is.  Also, the smell is amazing.  The grapefruit smell is very strong but different and not \\&quot;perfumey.\\&quot;  What I&#x27;ve been hearing from everyone is firstly WOW you smell great, then they notice my skin.  Very very highly recommended. I also bought them for my pre-teen and teen so that they have them on-hand to prevent breakouts and clean their faces throughout the day. They don&#x27;t dry your skin out at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the [[ASIN:B0010XUU9M Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes, Refill Pack, 25 Count]], but my pharmacy only carried these pink ones. I figured the \\&quot;Oil Free\\&quot; thing one of those silly little branding changes that probably didn&#x27;t matter much anyway. So I got them, assuming they would work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my god was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These actually HURT to use, at least if you use them anywhere near your eyes. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin either. And, seriously, if you can&#x27;t use these on eye makeup (because it hurts too much), what&#x27;s the point? My skin near my eyes is left red after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These should really come with a giant warning on the front saying \\&quot;DO NOT USE NEAR EYES.\\&quot; I wonder if it&#x27;s even safe to use them near your eyes, with all the alcohol in them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, they don&#x27;t work as well as the other ones.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes. I usually only use them if I&#x27;m running late for class and don&#x27;t feel like washing my face. So with that being said I use them about once a week. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using every day. I believe they exfoliate your skin a little as well.</li>
    <li> It is a wipe with grapefruit smell and clients  and love the smell and, cleanness,  glow after suing it .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that when using these my oily skin is just less oily. I use one when I wake up and another before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People complain about the smell, but I think it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s fruity and floral - I&#x27;d prefer something neutral but the bottom line is that these do a great job of clearing up oily skin problems and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> Way too fragrant!  Burns my skin and doesn&#x27;t clean off all the makeup, especially concealer and mascara.  Never buying this again.</li>
    <li> My daughter has oily skin and breaks out at over 30 years old.  She swears by these wipes and I buy them as stocking stuffers for her.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my teenage sons.  They shower at night and use the wipes in the morning.  They are easy to use to clean their faces so they actually use them!  They help keep their skin clean and acne free.</li>
    <li> Good Seller, pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> I wanted to like these so bad, as I have the Pink Grapefruit gel cleanser and I love it! But these just didn&#x27;t get it for me. I use cleansing wipes every night after a long day at work and I dont feel like going through a whole routine of getting make up off my face. I&#x27;ve tried many different wipes (Ponds, the regular Neutrogena wipes, Garnier, Olay, and off brand Equate to name some.)These Pink Grapefruit wipes are strongly parfumed (not really grapefruity but more flowery/Candyish), a bit abrasive and after using them my face feels so tight and residual that I end up using regular face wash and water to clean my face anyway! So far good ole Equate( off brand version of Ponds) seems to be top choice for me.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. As another reviewer said, the fragrance is pretty strong. My problem with it is that it doesn&#x27;t feel very cleansing and it feels like it leaves a slight residue on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be brief, lots of other reviews are more detailed.  They clean well, don&#x27;t rip, and don&#x27;t sting (I have oily skin, and not very sensitive).  The one big problem is - they don&#x27;t smell much like grapefruit.  Very strong, fake-grapefruit/disinfectant smell that i don&#x27;t find pleasant .  We all react differently to fragrances, your experience may be different.  I&#x27;m spoiled by the Giovanni wipes that i use after pumping gas and that grapefruit smell is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I could see these bothering sensitive skin as they tend to burn around the eyes. I love them and have used them for years without incident. My favorite scent ever</li>
    <li> These cleansing wipes smell really great and are strong enough to remove waterproof makeup.  They leave your skin squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> I was so anxious to buy these that I kept checking to see if they were in stock. When they were, I leapt at the opportunity! I have tried many face wipes over the years. My current favorite is the rose-scented kind from Forever 21. I like scented ones. Why isn&#x27;t this kind my favorite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these *specifically* because I love the scent of Pink Grapefruit. So it&#x27;s astounding for me to say that these face wipes have an overpowering fragrance. Too much of a good thing, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them every now and then, but I find that the fragrance lasts on my skin. Also, though I like the acne-control, it can burn sometimes. Again, too much of a good thing. So I don&#x27;t use these every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I DO use them, I make sure to *at least* splash my face, to remove any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORKS ON MASCARA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It does a great job of removing makeup, even mascara. I wrap the wipe around my finger and gently rub it back and forth across my lashes. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes because it doesn&#x27;t get in them. I repeat until the wipe stops showing mascara. It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Maybe prevents styes while I&#x27;m at it? Who knows, but I haven&#x27;t had a stye since the one time I got one, when I was 12 or 13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Nor have I run into any tigers. It&#x27;s tiger repellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MULTI-TASKING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I use a wipe to remove my makeup, I re-use it (while still damp) to wipe down one of my dogs, the one who has a mold spore allergy. The vet said to wipe her down daily to remove anything that she&#x27;d picked up while outside. (And we bathe her once a week.) In this use, the strong, lingering scent is perfect for freshening up her presence :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGH -QUALITY MATERIAL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes are *excellent* quality, very thick and moist. Despite having the unreliable sticky-flap seal, they have yet to dry out on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am going to check out some other Neutrogena wipes, because I really like the quality, if not the strong fragrance. I havent used Neutrogena wipes since their other fragrances ones bugged me - the &amp;#34;relaxing&amp;#34; one, I forget now. I&#x27;ll go back to plain, or try Deep Clean. It&#x27;s tingly as a cream wash. Might be great as a face wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also interested in the Pink Grapefruit body wash, because strong fragrance is more suitable for your body than on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, though 3 stars seems low, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; is how I feel about these, not &amp;#34;I like it.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m going by the guide.</li>
