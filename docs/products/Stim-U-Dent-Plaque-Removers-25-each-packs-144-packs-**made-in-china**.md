### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>BTW, in 12/08 Johnson &amp; Johnson sold the rights for this wonderful product to Caldwell Consumer Health (1-888-317-4402).</li>
      <li>Excellent to protect your gums.</li>
      <li>Great service.  </li>
      <li>and she has been recommending them to the people whose teeth she cleans for over 30 years with great results.  </li>
      <li>The seller was great.  </li>
      <li>Great deal.</li>
      <li>They make great stocking stuffers.    </li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Great for gun massage.</li>
      <li>The order was filled promptly and arrived in excellent condition, and my teeth and gums are very happy that I now have stimudents once again.</li>
      <li>They are very effective.</li>
      <li>These are mint-flavored--but the mint is pleasant and I quite like it.</li>
      <li>Good price.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was delighted with them for about 2-3 years before they became outsourced to China by the marketeering company CCW.</li>
      <li>These are probably the best oral &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; available.  </li>
      <li>The best part was my dentist telling me to keep up &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34; I was doing as my oral health was great and the depth of pockets in the gum were decreasing, much to his amazement.  </li>
      <li>Healthy Gums are a must !  </li>
      <li>Better than flossing!</li>
      <li>Because of Stimudents, after my flesh rots, I will still have my own teeth.  </li>
      <li>I Have used Stimudents for 30 years and find the easier to use than dental floss and just as effective.</li>
      <li>My husband was very pleased that I was able to find these mint flavored stim-u-dents at Amazon...</li>
      <li>After 1 week, my gum became healthy.  </li>
      <li>This is simply the best oral health product imaginable.</li>
      <li>Each time I go in for cleaning, they RAVE about how healthy my gums are, and how little-to-no plaque I have.</li>
      <li>My dental technician says these picks have been around for many years</li>
      <li>and my gum now stays healthy.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to get myself into the habit of daily flossing (mea culpa), but the Stim-U-Dents do a great job.</li>
      <li>As the saying goes &amp;#34;The truth is in the details.&amp;#34;, which I discovered when I read the fine print (company name, country of origin) on its otherwise identical packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why these aren&#x27;t available in the store anymore.      </li>
      <li>Also, it is important to swish with water or mouthwash to finish off the loosened material.  </li>
      <li>Used express mail which I didn&#x27;t ask for or need, BUT they added a bunch of free samples of the thinner version (get 40 per pack vice 25 of the thicker)  </li>
      <li>I was surprised, when shopping for them on Amazon, to find that they are no longer made by Johnson &amp; Johnson, and also puzzled by the product description on this item--\\&quot;made in China\\&quot; and \\&quot;not as good as\\&quot; etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I ordered this item and can report that it was delivered promptly, included free samples of the extra-thin Stimudents, and notwithstanding the \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; label, the Stimudents seem identical in every way to the ones I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
      <li>I see no difference from the original ones that I used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Stimulate your gums and leaves your mouth clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>... the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; product formerly made by J&amp;J in the USA was hands-down superior.</li>
      <li>Everyone should use these, and this is a great deal as they also include free samples(multiple packs) of the thinner variety for those tightly grouped teeth.</li>
      <li>A good product has become only marginally useful.</li>
      <li>At first it took me 45 minutes to clean all of my teeth.  </li>
      <li>his own dentist recommended that he use the stim-u-dent picks daily for the purpose of gum stimulation and plaque remover...</li>
      <li>They are much thinner and much easier to get between your teeth, however they bend easier and you may have to use more than one.</li>
      <li>price is right for  a case of these.</li>
      <li>Although I had to buy a very large amount in order to get them, I know my family</li>
      <li>She says if you brush and use these daily, you have a great shot at keeping your teeth your entire life.</li>
      <li>My kid wants the regular kind</li>
      <li>If you didn&#x27;t use the original, you wouldn&#x27;t know how quality has decreased, but this is a must for great dental care.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, there they were.  </li>
      <li>Stimudents are an essential aid to healthy teeth and gums.  </li>
      <li>They are even better, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be buying in the future.  </li>
      <li>THANKS!</li>
      <li>Recently discovered they are no longer available in stores and the first place I looked was Amazon!  </li>
      <li>Its an incredible bargain and shows how these big retailers gouge the american public.</li>
      <li>I discovered Stem-U-Dents a long time ago, and my dental hygienist became a confirmed believer in them as well!</li>
      <li>When J&amp;J manufactured that rarely ever occurred with normal usage; they would instead be replaced when the cleaning surfaces gradually became frayed.</li>
      <li>For example, my fingers are too large to  manipulate dental floss for its indented purpose.  </li>
      <li>After only a few months of use I noticed great improvement of my gums .  </li>
      <li>I much prefer these</li>
      <li>The last technician I saw said to me, in a genuinely astonished tone of voice, \\&quot;Whatever</li>
      <li>you are doing, it really works!\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.      </li>
      <li>otherwise I&#x27;ll come back to haunt them - a friendly phantom nibble in the night.   </li>
      <li>This is not a problem, because there are twice as many in a packet than the other ones I had used.</li>
      <li>these are different than the ones I have previously bought, but unlike others I think the difference is good.</li>
      <li>So, I went to Amazon, as I usually do when I need to find something, and I was very pleased to see that I could purchase this large pack that should last for years.  </li>
      <li>This product normally sells in a \\&quot;4</li>
      <li>- I ordered them on the Net because I couldn&#x27;t find them at Longs or Target and the price was right even though I had to buy thousands of them.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for more than forty years, and I found that they are getting much harder to buy at the local pharmacy.  </li>
      <li>Stem-U-Dents are stronger than ordinary tooth picks, and they are better designed to remove food particles, plaque and stimulate gums.  </li>
      <li>still do the job far better than any other product on the market that is intended for the same purpose (plaque removal in the spaces between teeth).</li>
      <li>Our family&#x27;s dental check ups have improved, really helps with cleaning between teeth even after flossing and using a Sonicare toothbrush, picks can still loosen tiny imbedding pieces of nuts.</li>
      <li>In my case it stopped it completely.</li>
      <li>The residue removed shows they are a needed action after flossing  and brushing.  </li>
      <li>Okay, after a little more trials I found that the thinner pix are too fragile (or bend) to work with (thick fingers issue) on some of the upper tongue side teeth...</li>
      <li>My wife and I probably go through 10 of these each day, so the large package lasts us a long time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Stim-U-Dents for several years, and I recommend them highly.</li>
      <li>They are only a little better than a regular toothpick because of their shape.  </li>
      <li>Although I REALLY appreciate Stim-U-Dents, and have for over thirty years, I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the product I ordered for several reasons: they are a thinner/lighter/poorer version of the earlier-made or &#x27;real&#x27; Stim-u-Dent; It is hard to be told &#x27;original&#x27; and then feel like you were \\&quot;bait-and-Switch\\&quot;-ed with a poorer product; and, it feels like some health products are going the way of the grocery store--less product and shinier advertising with poorer quality for MORE money!!</li>
      <li>On all outside gums and 1/2 the inside gums they are ok if you go slow.  </li>
      <li>Yes the quality has decreased since Made in China-wood not as strong, frays at end easier, cracks easier, but since there is not another company making these, I will keep using.</li>

<li> There is not a doubt in my mind that I will have my teeth for my entire life, with no major dental problems (and the resulting pain &amp; bills ) in the interim.</li>
<li> I figure this order will save me about $50 this year  over the ones I usually get in my decently priced store (Fred Meyer) where I can often wait for their sale which happens a couple times a year..  </li>
<li> and I will have them for a long time.  </li>
<li> I have been using Stim-U-Dents for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> he has been using this same brand regularly for the past several years...</li>
<li> These are single packs and if you work out the price including shipping you are paying about $1.10 to 1.25 per 4 packs.</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t go anywhere without my \\&quot;sticks\\&quot;, and my hygienist generally doesn&#x27;t give me too much trouble.</li>
<li> Always wondered about trying those and tested a couple tonight and with a little care they didn&#x27;t break, and probably won&#x27;t not often enough to matter.  </li>
<li> and I can use it with my eyes closed.  </li>
<li> Getting harder to even find these at some places.&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
<li> Extremely convenient and works well.</li>
<li> I brush with a Sonic brush, use floss and then finish up swiping down the gumline with these things ( takes 2 picks and 15 seconds).  </li>
<li> These little rascals will saver your teeth and gums.  </li>
<li> I use it everyday now</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll be using one regular and one thin then.  </li>
<li> The special shape helps to compact the gums against the base of the teeth thereby limiting the debris that may penetrate your gums.</li>
<li> At first it was painful because my gum bleeds around every tooth.  </li>
<li> Just a little disappointing that they snap so frequently now.</li>
<li> (sorry to be gross).  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Stimudents for at least 20 years, but lately have had trouble finding them in stores.</li>
<li> /&gt;Satisfied customer to say the least...</li>
<li> Sad.</li>

    <li> ... the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; product formerly made by J&amp;J in the USA was hands-down superior. Ever since the product line was sold to Caldwell Consumer Health (CCW) and manufacturing moved to China (2009), the breaking strength of these toothpicks became weaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted with them for about 2-3 years before they became outsourced to China by the marketeering company CCW. Afterward, I observed right-off that my rate of usage had suddenly tripled. As the saying goes &amp;#34;The truth is in the details.&amp;#34;, which I discovered when I read the fine print (company name, country of origin) on its otherwise identical packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They still do the job far better than any other product on the market that is intended for the same purpose (plaque removal in the spaces between teeth). Just a little disappointing that they snap so frequently now. When J&amp;J manufactured that rarely ever occurred with normal usage; they would instead be replaced when the cleaning surfaces gradually became frayed.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to get myself into the habit of daily flossing (mea culpa), but the Stim-U-Dents do a great job. I won&#x27;t go anywhere without my \\&quot;sticks\\&quot;, and my hygienist generally doesn&#x27;t give me too much trouble. (I do floss now and then, just to stay on the up-and-up.) I&#x27;ve been using Stim-U-Dents for several years, and I recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> My dentist taught me how to use it.  After 1 week, my gum became healthy.  At first it was painful because my gum bleeds around every tooth.  After 7 days, the bleeding was reduced drastically. At first it took me 45 minutes to clean all of my teeth.  Now it only takes me 10 minutes and I can use it with my eyes closed.  I use it everyday now and my gum now stays healthy.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why these aren&#x27;t available in the store anymore.      Great service.  Good price.  Fast delivery.      THANKS!</li>
    <li> This is simply the best oral health product imaginable. A dental technician recommended it to me 15-20 years ago, and am I ever grateful that she did! Each time I go in for cleaning, they RAVE about how healthy my gums are, and how little-to-no plaque I have. The last technician I saw said to me, in a genuinely astonished tone of voice, \\&quot;Whatever you are doing, it really works!\\&quot; I answered, \\&quot;Each evening as I watch TV (may as well be making additional use of that time), I brush, then floss, then use a Stim-U-Dent pic, and finally a pereo aid.\\&quot; The Stim-U-Dent pic removes plaque BETWEEN the teeth, and the pereo aid removes plaque from the gumline ALONG the teeth. There is not a doubt in my mind that I will have my teeth for my entire life, with no major dental problems (and the resulting pain &amp; bills ) in the interim. In conclusion, if you value your teeth and oral health, use this product. You will NEVER regret doing so. BTW, in 12/08 Johnson &amp; Johnson sold the rights for this wonderful product to Caldwell Consumer Health (1-888-317-4402). CCH is marketing it in the same packaging, although not necessarily via the same retail outlets.</li>
    <li> I now have enough Stimudents to last me beyond the grave.  Because of Stimudents, after my flesh rots, I will still have my own teeth.  If there are any stimudents left over after my demise, they will be passed on to family and friends to remind them to Floss, Stimudent, Brush and Listerine before going to bed otherwise I&#x27;ll come back to haunt them - a friendly phantom nibble in the night.   Enough with the levity - I ordered them on the Net because I couldn&#x27;t find them at Longs or Target and the price was right even though I had to buy thousands of them.  They make great stocking stuffers.    Healthy Gums are a must !  Regina Scheiding</li>
    <li> My dental technician says these picks have been around for many years and she has been recommending them to the people whose teeth she cleans for over 30 years with great results.  She says if you brush and use these daily, you have a great shot at keeping your teeth your entire life.</li>
    <li> My husband was very pleased that I was able to find these mint flavored stim-u-dents at Amazon...our local department store doesn&#x27;t stock them anymore...he has been using this same brand regularly for the past several years...his own dentist recommended that he use the stim-u-dent picks daily for the purpose of gum stimulation and plaque remover...I would buy them again and again for him...and the hubbie definately recommends them...we give the transaction at Amazon a two thumbs up...</li>
    <li> These little rascals will saver your teeth and gums.  These also came with some samples of the ultrathin version of these picks.  They are even better, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be buying in the future.  My wife and I probably go through 10 of these each day, so the large package lasts us a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using Stim-U-Dents for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right for  a case of these. I see no difference from the original ones that I used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality is the same from what I see. I have been using these made is China ones for a year or two now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied customer to say the least...</li>
    <li> One, all Stim-U-Dents are made in China, two these are different than the ones I have previously bought, but unlike others I think the difference is good. They are much thinner and much easier to get between your teeth, however they bend easier and you may have to use more than one. This is not a problem, because there are twice as many in a packet than the other ones I had used. I much prefer these and you get a life time supply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Stimudents for at least 20 years, but lately have had trouble finding them in stores. I was surprised, when shopping for them on Amazon, to find that they are no longer made by Johnson &amp; Johnson, and also puzzled by the product description on this item--\\&quot;made in China\\&quot; and \\&quot;not as good as\\&quot; etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I ordered this item and can report that it was delivered promptly, included free samples of the extra-thin Stimudents, and notwithstanding the \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; label, the Stimudents seem identical in every way to the ones I&#x27;ve used for years. Well, there is one difference. These are mint-flavored--but the mint is pleasant and I quite like it. I have no hesitation in recommending these Stimudents for anybody with teeth!</li>
    <li> Have been using these for years, buying them at the store when I needed to.  Recently discovered they are no longer available in stores and the first place I looked was Amazon!  Sure enough, there they were.  Although I had to buy a very large amount in order to get them, I know my family and I will have them for a long time.  Great product.  I keep a pack in my purse, one on my night table.  Extremely convenient and works well.</li>
    <li> I Have used Stimudents for 30 years and find the easier to use than dental floss and just as effective.</li>
    <li> Stimudents are an essential aid to healthy teeth and gums.  I&#x27;ve been using them for more than forty years, and I found that they are getting much harder to buy at the local pharmacy.  So, I went to Amazon, as I usually do when I need to find something, and I was very pleased to see that I could purchase this large pack that should last for years.  The order was filled promptly and arrived in excellent condition, and my teeth and gums are very happy that I now have stimudents once again.</li>
    <li> These are probably the best oral &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; available.  Before using my gums would bleed during cleanings and agressive brushing.  After only a few months of use I noticed great improvement of my gums .  The best part was my dentist telling me to keep up &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34; I was doing as my oral health was great and the depth of pockets in the gum were decreasing, much to his amazement.  Everyone should use these, and this is a great deal as they also include free samples(multiple packs) of the thinner variety for those tightly grouped teeth.</li>
    <li> I have always swear by the Stimudent picks.  They are very effective. the wood gives an extra dimension to cleaning .  I brush with a Sonic brush, use floss and then finish up swiping down the gumline with these things ( takes 2 picks and 15 seconds).  The residue removed shows they are a needed action after flossing  and brushing.  Run your fibger over the tip after a swipe and feel the slime (sorry to be gross).  \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; means nothing.negative to me....Whenever that change of mfg occurred was un-noticible to me.  .Wish I would have known and bought these in bulk like this offer years ago, would have saved a bundle.  Though I use only 2-3 picks a night, my son somehow uses 10 a night...go figure.&lt;br /&gt;  The seller was great.  Used express mail which I didn&#x27;t ask for or need, BUT they added a bunch of free samples of the thinner version (get 40 per pack vice 25 of the thicker)  Always wondered about trying those and tested a couple tonight and with a little care they didn&#x27;t break, and probably won&#x27;t not often enough to matter.  I&#x27;m sold on the thinner ones for the next go around.  My kid wants the regular kind though.&lt;br /&gt;  I figure this order will save me about $50 this year  over the ones I usually get in my decently priced store (Fred Meyer) where I can often wait for their sale which happens a couple times a year..  Could be twice that savings for those who don&#x27;t shop around and are made of money.  Getting harder to even find these at some places.&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  Okay, after a little more trials I found that the thinner pix are too fragile (or bend) to work with (thick fingers issue) on some of the upper tongue side teeth...a right-handed dexterity problem for me.  I have to use an angle that bends the thinner ones. On all outside gums and 1/2 the inside gums they are ok if you go slow.  I&#x27;ll be using one regular and one thin then.  Also, it is important to swish with water or mouthwash to finish off the loosened material.  Don&#x27;t let my concerns on the thinpix detract from my overall praise, especially for the regular sized pix.</li>
    <li> Although I REALLY appreciate Stim-U-Dents, and have for over thirty years, I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the product I ordered for several reasons: they are a thinner/lighter/poorer version of the earlier-made or &#x27;real&#x27; Stim-u-Dent; It is hard to be told &#x27;original&#x27; and then feel like you were \\&quot;bait-and-Switch\\&quot;-ed with a poorer product; and, it feels like some health products are going the way of the grocery store--less product and shinier advertising with poorer quality for MORE money!! Sad.</li>
    <li> Using dental floss just doesn&#x27;t cut it for everyone!  For example, my fingers are too large to  manipulate dental floss for its indented purpose.  Having big figures isn&#x27;t a requirement, however!  Stem-U-Dents are stronger than ordinary tooth picks, and they are better designed to remove food particles, plaque and stimulate gums.  I discovered Stem-U-Dents a long time ago, and my dental hygienist became a confirmed believer in them as well!</li>
    <li> Excellent to protect your gums. The special shape helps to compact the gums against the base of the teeth thereby limiting the debris that may penetrate your gums. Helps to stop the bleeding. In my case it stopped it completely.</li>
    <li> This product normally sells in a \\&quot;4 Pack\\&quot;  for $2.79 at CVS or Walreens. These are single packs and if you work out the price including shipping you are paying about $1.10 to 1.25 per 4 packs. Its an incredible bargain and shows how these big retailers gouge the american public. Go for it. Great deal.</li>
    <li> Have been using for 58 years. Better than flossing! Stimulate your gums and leaves your mouth clean and refreshed. Like the mint flavor. Would like a cinnamon flavor. Could not do without these. Carry packs in all vehicles, purses,  etc.</li>
    <li> These are made from an entirely different wood. They are only a little better than a regular toothpick because of their shape.  A good product has become only marginally useful.</li>
