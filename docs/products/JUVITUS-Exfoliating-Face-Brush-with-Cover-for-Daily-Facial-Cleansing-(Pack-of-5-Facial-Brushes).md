<li> Tighens my pores and rids the dead skin off with face soap.</li>
<li> These are to hard for the face however they can be used for other things around the house.</li>

    <li> Perfect for exfoliating</li>
    <li> They are great. A little rough but a light touch works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY reason for my 4 star review is out of a pack of 5 I only received 4 brushes..</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, and the price is fair, but the bristles are kind of long and flimsy so it doesn&#x27;t do a great job of exfoliating. Plus, all the tiny metal clasps that hold the bristles in rusts after just a few uses. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Arrived in excellent condition.  Each brush comes with a fitted cap to keep bristles perfect.  I love these brushes.  They really do deep clean on your skin removing makeup and oils - thus reducing breakouts.</li>
    <li> These are to hard for the face however they can be used for other things around the house. Or assist with home pedicures.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really soft however I noticed after using it for a week my brushes had a orange color to them and it&#x27;s because they have rust.. You can&#x27;t see it but what&#x27;s holding the bristles is a metal wire.. Yes I do clean my brushes and dry them but they still manage to rust overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t want to put rust on my face. I recommend buying something else..</li>
    <li> I was expecting a firmer brush.  It&#x27;s very soft and for exfoliating, it takes multiple cleansings to remove all the dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> Great product. Recommended to friends and family. Durable lil brushes that last long. Makes my skill soft snd healthy. Excellent. ..</li>
    <li> Great face brush.  Soft enough to not leave face sore, for I have sensitive skin.  Tighens my pores and rids the dead skin off with face soap.</li>
    <li> Nice product I think they are to expensive they do work well to clean your skin</li>
    <li> These brushes are exactly what I was looking for, and now I can keep one in the tub, in my drawer, in my grab-and-go bag . . . with two to spare.  (:</li>
    <li> Adequate exfoliating brushes.  I bought this pack to share with my family members.  The bristles are soft enough for my young granddaughters to use.  I keep exfoliating brushes handy in the shower and at the sink to adequately and gently assist me in removing make-up during my facial cleansing routine.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Every morning I use this brush with my facial cleaner.  I am especially intrigue when I use it for removing my makeup.  I am not a makeup user everyday, but I am happy to know, I have assistance with my makeup removal. I also, use the brush to apply my moisturzer in the morning and at night.  It help to absorb the moisture in my skin.  I really do see a difference when I use this brush.  I clean the brush after every use with a sanitizer soap, let it dry and wait for the next use.</li>
    <li> Good for exfoliating after using Retina A or a peel.  Like that they have covers good for traveling.  Would buy again.</li>

    <li> I have had to throw two of them away because the bristles looked like they rusted at the root and I didn&#x27;t want that on my face.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and the price was right ! The bristles are nice and soft ,not scratchy on my face.</li>
    <li> Hoping to get a brush that would exfoliate, but got something too soft to really scrub my face.
