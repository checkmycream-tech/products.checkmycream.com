    <li> Great item. Made my hair so soft and shiny. AAA+++</li>
    <li> Same as shampoo &#x3D; great product but expensive for the small amount you get!</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling squeaky clean, and I love the mild scent. It lathers up beautifully, and rinses out completely leaving my hair feeling soft and looking shiny!  I will continue using this product regularly and have more on order!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to have found this shampoo.  My color processed hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in several years.  It looks healthier and shiny.  It is nice and thick and works into a good lather.  It has a mild, pleasant smell.  If I could change anything about it I would add some volumizer to it.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look as thick as it does when I use a shampoo that volumizes.  I think the trade off is worth it though.</li>
    <li> Two of the three products of this line were not sealed.  May need some quality control. Dd not know how it works.  I will give the products a try.  This is the first time I have had trouble with products.</li>
    <li> I really  love the whole line of JF products. They make my hair look better than ever! I wish they were easier to buy .I can&#x27;t always find what I need and inventory is low. Only place to buy it is Amazon or the company.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It leaves my hair incredibly soft.</li>
    <li> i love Julien Farel products, I have kind of thin hair and this really helps with volume plus they&#x27;re such good quality.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Actually, my title said most of it. I balked at the price of the shampoo, but I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo that needed so little to create a huge lather. It helps with the rest to really, really bring my hair back to approaching its virgin state. I now need to get the conditioner- I&#x27;m two for two with loving the heck out of JF&#x27;s hair products.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Heard about it on a TV show, one of the anchors raved about it so I decided to give it a try. I really like it. I am losing my hair due to medicine so am willing to try products. I am a believer and bought another one of the shampoos to try.</li>
    <li> I have not seen a shampoo lather like this one in ages, a little goes a long way.  This product does not leave my hair feeling like split ends after drying like some shampoos do.  I did not have to use a conditioner for a change.</li>
    <li> was expericing some hair loss due to stressful situation and used the Restore.Like the way it felt and the shine. Not medicinal at all. Alternate that now with the hydrating shampoo and conditioner.  Stress situation resolved and hair is &#x27;doing well&#x27; Will continue to use products. Really like it. Saw it on GMA and ordered on line.  Happy I &#x27;found it&#x27;.</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt softer, silkier, or looked healthier.  Best shampoo I have ever used.  Also use and like the conditioner.</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t do much for my husbands hair. It really didn&#x27;t but body in his hair at all and he was disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> I received product with seal removed, I don&#x27;t feel this product is the real deal. I believe for what I paid for the conditioner and shampoo, you can find other products out there that deliver. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel dirty</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. My daughter uses it, too. She uses the normal to fine and I use the colored treated. Better than Living Proof and Wen products. I saw it on GMA and Josh said it got rid of his &amp;#34;cowlick&amp;#34;. It got rid of mine, as well</li>
    <li> No di8fferent than any other product</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. Gives great coverage to colored hair.....</li>
    <li> Nice smell and lather. Have not noticed any changes in my hair quality. The product was expensive and the S &amp; H charges were ridiculous. If I do not see more improvement in my hair, I will not buy this again.</li>
