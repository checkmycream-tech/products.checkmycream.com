<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Anything by this brand has my 100% approval. I am a naturalista and my hair has totally fallen in love with this line of hair care!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, so it can be hard to find a hair product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily.  This oil works through my hair beautifully, makes it feel silky, and smells nice.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> works wonders for your hair, I wouldn&#x27;t use any brand other than HSI! This is perfect, leaving your hair healthy and looking amazing!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because I normally don&#x27;t like the smell of Argan oil but the fragrance is pretty light and doesn&#x27;t bother me.  My hair is coarse and set but feels softer and less grizzled when I use this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff I put it in my hair overnight and my hair that is usually a tangled mess no longer tangles I use it once a week</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it and works well under heat</li>
    <li> I like to use this on my hair when I straighten it. Helps keep it protected from the heat and it leaves my hair shiny!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair shiny, soft and protects from the heat of my straightening iron. And the fragrance is amazing. My hair looks younger than I do!</li>
    <li> This product was everything I was looking for! All last summer it was my Ho to when I went to the river- just a little of this comes through my locks then scrunched, then Voilà! Will definitely plan to purcjSe more in the future. Recommended to anyone looking for light, smoothing control for hair- not heavy or greasy!</li>
    <li> HSI is a great brand! I highly recommend. Works well. Makes my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> The HSI ARGAN OIL LEAVE IN CONDITIONER is one of the Best Conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hair was very damaged, &amp; Dy: when I used the leave in conditioner, it made my hair silky soft and after one week of using it my hair was greatly improved, it keeps getting Stonger, and the elasticity has returned!</li>
    <li> Loved the product and the seller. Top seller. Recommend all!</li>
    <li> This stuff is like neosporin for your hair, I would recommend for anyone who has severely damaged there hair by coloring or using too much heat.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!!! It made my hair super soft. I would definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome service and product. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year now (ordered more after I received as a free sample with the HSI Curling Iron). I cannot believe how healthy my hair looks and how much it has grown! My hair is the longest it has been in many years! My friends have also noticed the change in my hair and I have recommended that they try it too. I will keep using it as it is an excellent hair product.</li>
    <li> There were so many glowing reviews for this hair mask that I couldn&#x27;t imagine that I wouldn&#x27;t love it.  I am writing a review to give a possible warning to others, in case my &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; are something they would be concerned about. My first thought upon opening this product was how strong and unpleasant the smell was.  I decided to try it anyway, thinking that perhaps I would get used to the smell.  I applied the mask to my hair, first distributing it evenly on my fingers. My second thought about this prodruct was that it actually tangled my hair by just applying it. My hair does not tangle easily; the only time it snarls as much as it did yesterday (after applying this) is when I ride in a convertible.  The strong (and slightly musky) smell remained strong for 3-4 hours, but was gone when I woke up today.  Disclaimer:  I am sensitive to smells, but I did want to mention its presence in case that helps someone. I gave this mask 3 stars because it did make my hair a bit softer.  These two issues compelled me to return the item today.  It was an easy Amazon return.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!!  Leaves my coarse hair soft and shiny.  I wish it had a pump, but I made due.  Super fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best if not the best hair product I have purchased, it makes my hair amazing..  silky smooth no oily residue no greasy look. I have purchased several shine enhancing products but I have long, fine hair and they tend to make my hair look stringy greasy and unwashed, this on the other hand does the job, no greasy string hair just smooth silky frizz free! I really do love it.</li>
    <li> Love the product and would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I loved this oil. My hair is shiny, soft and never greasy. I let my mother-in-law try and she fell in love with it as well. So we ordered a bottle for her. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This oil is by far the best heat protection I&#x27;ve tried for straightening.  Leaves hair shiny but not not oily looking &amp; it actually helps my hair to STAY straight, even in humid weather!  I&#x27;ve never found a product that can do that for my crazy hair - love it!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It leaves my hair shiny and frizz free. Also I love the smell. It is as good as Moroccan oil at HALF the price</li>
    <li> I have used a few different brands of Argan oil, I most honestly say HSI is my favorite because it does not weigh my hair down like other oils I&#x27;ve tried. The smell is fine and very light as well . Leaves my hair ready for the flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this. I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without.  I love short hair styles but one stylist went a little crazy with the razor on my ends and ruined my hair. Nothing g worked to bring it back to healthy again that was until I found this. I swear by this I make all 3 of my daughters use it. They love it to.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, quality and shipping.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! My hair is so much softer and I even use it in my beard! Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite styling product. It was recommended to me by a friend.  I use it sparingly and only on the bottom half of my hair to make it smooth and keep down fly-aways.  Smells nice too!</li>
    <li> I received the oil quickly. I have enjoyed using this product because I damage my hair to create bright colors and this makes it look healthy anyways. Sometimes I use this on my skin as well as a moisturizer and barrier.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> this condtioner was phenomenal! i used this in combination with the shampoo and argon oil, and my hair was so soft and full of body, i will never use anything else again! i&#x27;m african american with medium length hair</li>
    <li> I love my Argan Oil! It has made a world of difference with my hair. It took me a while to figure out the right amount for my hair, but once I did, I was satisfied. I put a little on before I blow dry my hair and a little after I blow dry. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Liked this Hair mask. Soft and Silky. Great product</li>
    <li> This argan oil wasnt very good. I have very fine African American hair and my hair is dry and needs more water based products. This product was so oil based that I felt as if there wasn&#x27;t any moisture added to my hair and my hair broke off. If your hair is fine, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I got this for a special someone, and that person really enjoys it.  The price is fair, and the results are awesome.</li>
    <li> HSI Argan Oil has improved not only the appearance of my hair but also the health of it. My hair is silky and strong and I really do attribute it to this product. I also recommend the HSI Flat Iron because if used with this product, there will be no damage to your hair. I don&#x27;t think there is a better product out there to prevent dryness and frizziness that also improves the health of your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Instantly make  hair silky, shinny and with a healthy look. It is s non-greasy, residue free, non-alcohol, ultra-light.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I like how it smooths my hair without it feeling oily or greasy. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This product is great on your hair.  I am very pleased with this product. It is very hydrating for my hair.  I have afro-textured hair and it does not make your hair frizzy.  Also, this product has a very nice smell.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Just a little bit goes a long way and controls frizziness and leaves my hair silky smooth.  Great product and service!</li>
    <li> I love it I use it about once a week and it makes my hair silky.</li>
    <li> I use this along with, or in place of, my normal conditioner and let it sit for 5-10 minutes while I shower. I think it does make my hair softer, shinier and more manageable. But I have color treated hair and hypothyroid issues so my hair isn&#x27;t as shiny as it used to be. I have used a small amount of this as a leave in conditioner, but I think if you used a lot of it you hair might look greasy or gunky. But I haven&#x27;t tried this, so I don&#x27;t know. This is a great value for how much product you receive. The seller was great and it shipped fast.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Good product and excellent service.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it on dry hair overnight. It absorbs right in and oddly enough, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel drenched/wet. A lot of product is needed for long hair. It is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product from day one. With some products, the anticipation is often met with disappointment when placing online orders. That was not the case here. I&#x27;m very pleased. What&#x27;s more, HSI followed up to address any questions or concerns I should have regarding their product. It was nice of them to follow up and make sure I was satisfied with my purchase. I would highly recommend this to anyone willing to solve their hair problems.</li>
    <li> Great product, enjoying new lease of my hairs. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I use it after I shampoo, and leave it in my hair before drying.</li>
    <li> My hair is Asian textured that is dyed every 3 to 4 weeks to cover gray hair. This product is my go to deep hair conditioner. It works amazing! After coloring, I leave it on for 15 minutes and my hair is revived back to it&#x27;s shiny and healthy state. A little goes a long way. Shipping was fast as well. I will definitely continue using this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I wound definitely recommend the product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I have coarse chemically straightened hair, and I think this mask really helps keep my hair soft and smooth.  You can feel the difference right after you rinse it off.  My hair is softer and it&#x27;s really easy to comb it.  The other bonus is that It doesn&#x27;t tangle up as much.  And it stays soft and more manageable when it dries.  I would certainly recommend the HSI for people with dry hair, or perhaps those with chemically straightened hair.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It makes my hair so soft and removes static without adding weight. It&#x27;s been a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Wife Very much enjoys this product. It protects her hair from the heat and it was noticeably softer after use. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I got this product since it has Argan listed in its ingredients ... to start with I tested it on my husband&#x27;s hair .. his hair is usually dry and rough. But after applying and washing it after 5 minutes, I felt his hair more soft and smells great! Next I am looking so forward to try it on my hair/&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend. The size seems right for the price...not bad!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Great for use before blow drying and as an everyday leave treatment.  Does not leave your hair feeling oily/greasy.  Shipping was great.  I am not a regualr user of this product.</li>
    <li> I actually received my very first bottle of this free when I bought an HSI hair straighter. I loved this stuff so much that when it ran out I had to buy another bottle. You only need a tiny amount of it so it last for a really long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best product on the market!!! I&#x27;ve used many.</li>
    <li> This oil is the TRUTH! A little goes a long way and I use about a dime size prior to flat ironing my hair. The results are AMAZING!! This Argan oil leaves my hair silky and shiny...almost like when I let a professional do my hair. #WIN</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works on my curly hair and I can apply it while it&#x27;s still wet for a brilliant shine or apply it right before I blow it out/straighten it for a sleek look. Either way, this is my go-to product and I for sure recommend it. I also like that it&#x27;s not too oily on your hair or hands.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Came unsealed, but apparently this is how it&#x27;s meant to be. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used, and I used to be a hairdresser. It eliminated frizz, smooths the hair, and makes it stronger. I thought it might be oily, but it&#x27;s not. I actually put it on dry hair before bed and washed it in the morning. It was great! I&#x27;m sure it works just as well if you use it according to the directions.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works incredibly well with the HSI flat iron. I originally was introduced to this product when I purchased my HSI flat iron and have used it since for a couple of years now. It also smells amazingly great! I will continue to use this product with the HSI flat iron. I would imagine you can also use it as a hair moisturizer without the flat iron if you have dry hair! 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a hair care treatment  without having to go to the salon and this product is now part of my routine.  I would also recommend the leave in argon oil!!!!</li>
    <li> i never write reviews but i am for this one bc it works so well! i cut my hair shoulder length a month or so ago. it used to be at my waist. and of course, now i miss my long pretty hair. so i am trying to grow my hair out asap! and in order to do that, your hair needs to be conditioned and manageable, which this product does. at first, i was nervous trying this product bc my hair is very weird and many products with good reviews still do nothing to my hair. but this product defiantly works! and you get so much for what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Leaves hair silky and easy to flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff.  Makes my hair feel so soft and smells so good!!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This smoothing hair mask is fantastic. I noticed immediate positive results after the first use. My hair was shiny, soft and smelled good too. Thanks for offering your product via Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have fried frizzy hair with tons of split ends. I used this smoothing hair mask overnight and my hair is soooo smooth. I flat ironed my hair and it looks like I just left the salon! Smells good too!</li>
    <li> I have used this twice, for 6-7 minutes after a shampoo, and my hair is recovering from dry, flyaway, split ends and little curl.  And, it is shiny, with body, and it is remembering its curl.  A good product, it works!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It worked great on my hair. I am definitely ordering more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Nothing less than amazing! I use it in my wet hair to detangle and in my dry hair before I iron it. It leaves my hair soft, shinny and never oily.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it! You won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> I really loved the Leave-in Argan Oil Treatment. It kept my Flat-iron style real nice and slick for the two weeks that I kept that style. I would highly recommend this product for anyone wanting a long lasting style and protection from heat damage.</li>
    <li> Works well &amp; smells great! !!</li>
    <li> I purchase this after having damage hair from straightening it so much. The product helped my hair leaving it healthy and silky when straightening now best product I have found from all argan oils I used from expensive organic ones to over counter</li>
    <li> I love this product! A little goes a LONG way. My hair is so much healthier since I have started using this product. I apply it twice everyday. I applyit once when my hair is still damp and once when my hair is completely dry. It smooths down my split ends and makes my hair look like new! I will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> I bought the Argan Oil for my wife.  She puts a few drop between her hands and rubs oil lightly in her hair to keep it from frizzing and flying away.  She also lightly pats a couple of drops on her face after washing her face at night.  It absorbs quickly and keeps her skin smooth while she&#x27;s sleeping.  She absolutely loves this product!  Recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> I love HSI products they leave your hair so shiny and smooth!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff . Would buy again .</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND IT WORKS VERY WELL IN MY HAIR. THE PRICE IS COMPETIVE AND WORTH IT. THANKS</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter. She has long hair gradually going curly, and is frizzing up at the moment. She loved it! Calms her hair down and leaves a great shine!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I use it every day, it works great on my texture of hair and smells good too!  I will definitely be ordering from this company again!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, my wife loves it</li>
    <li> This product is really amaizing!!! I got two of this (one for me, the second one for my sister) after i got the small tester when i bought the flat iron which is incredible as well.&lt;br /&gt;This product works very well in my texturized hair and i use it evertime i wash my hair,  go to the beauty salon or use the fat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it and will buy it again!!!!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a 16-ounce jar of the HSI Professional Hair Mask with Argon Oil, and I am so glad I did!  The quality ingredients in this hair formula are amazing.  Following the easy-to-apply directions, within minutes my hair was transformed into a beautiful resilient sheen that I haven&#x27;t experienced in years.  It&#x27;s now manageable and full of new life.  I even tried it on my beard, and it works great for that as well.  It is the perfect complement to the HSI Professional Leave-In Hair Treatment with Argan Oil, with great results.  I would highly recommend this product for men and women alike.  About the time I didn&#x27;t think there could be a better product, and then this new Hair Mask comes on the market and blows me right out of my saddle.  Praises to HSI Professional products!</li>
    <li> Love his argon oil. It keeps my hair shiny and keeps my scalp healthy. I stopped  using it for awhile  and I noticed I lost more hair, I started it again and I notice less hair breakage in the shower and on my brush. I also love the smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and the highest quality, I won&#x27;t buy from anywhere else now.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! Works great with the hair.</li>
    <li> My hair was extremely damaged from dying and heat processes.  I was hopeful this would improve or mend my hair but it didn&#x27;t.  It does make hair feel much softer, but I ended up having to cut off all the damaged hair.  This product doesn&#x27;t claim to mend hair.  It does however work very well in giving hair a softer and healthier appearance.  It is especially good to use whenever flat ironing your hair because I believe it protects it some from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial review is above.  However, after using this for a few weeks I noticed it leaves behind a waxy buildup that eventually makes your hair look dirty.  Definitely not something you&#x27;ll want to use on a regular basis, but maybe once a month or every couple weeks at the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.</li>
    <li> Great product. Made my hair so smooth. Hsi is my new favorite! I use both shampoo and conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly, exactly as pictured.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but it did make a difference in the texture of my hair.  I will definitely be using it more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The picture has changed from the item I purchased, however, it just seems to be new packaging.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle so far.  I use it once in a while when I feel my hair has suffered harsh circumstances.  It adds a layer of softness beyond what you may get from an average conditioner.  I like to keep it in my gym bag so I can put some in my hair before hitting the sauna.  Your hair can dry out in that type of heat, so I put this on to protect it and have a deeper conditioning experience.</li>
    <li> This is the only product my 15 year old will use on her hair. She said it doesn&#x27;t feel or make her hair greasy at all. Best of all it is not sticky! Doesn&#x27;t mirror that of something bought off the shelf at Walmart by far.</li>
    <li> Such a great product! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products to make my hair softer and shinier but this one works the best!</li>
    <li> I have VERY dry,  curly hair that I straighten. I use this while my hair is wet, then blow dry and flat iron. My hair feels great when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great in the morning. My hair is very thick and frizzes up severly, I take about a quarter size of this and spread it in my hair and the frizz is greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would buy again</li>
    <li> Loved it!  Leaves my hair shiny and protected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a concentrated hair mask for quite a while, and decided to try this one.  I&#x27;ve used it twice now, and am very impressed. My hair is actually quite healthy -- but this adds an amazing amount of bounce and shine to my short, curly hair.  I used it again yesterday, and the softness and suppleness lasts after additional shampoos. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to pamper their hair!!</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and color-treated and I was amazed at how soft my hair was after using this.  This HSI hair mask is not thick and heavy at all so I was not sure what to expect. It rinsed out cleanly. The real difference happened when I dried my hair with the blow dryer -  my hair was noticeably shinier and softer.  I have been using this for a few weeks now and have done both the 15 minute deep condition and the regular 5 minute condition.  Both results are great. I highly recommend this product and have told many friends about it already.</li>
    <li> This is awesome. The tub is huge. I loved the smell and was the best treatment my hair ever had. Why pay price salons when you you can do it yourself at home. Ive already rold my girlfriends know about it. I love it. Plus seller notified me right away with my shipping info and i recieved it right away.  Im still amazed how great this has helped and worked for my hair and the size was wow</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for about five days now and omg i am impressed.. my hair feels and looks so much healthier!!</li>
    <li> Best organ oil i ever used.  My hair is so relax and shiny.</li>
    <li> Great product, feels and smells good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll buy it again makes my hair easy to comb and shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this hair mask as it makes my hair feel soft and has a pleasant smell. Also, I have noticed less hair falling out (which I can&#x27;t say for sure is a result of this product, but it my opinion it is). I have been using the whole HSI line, including the flat iron, and would not only recommend this mask, but the whole line as well.</li>
    <li> I completely satisfied with this product! I have a dry damage hair and this mask helps me to improve my hair image.</li>
    <li> I have very long curly hair and this product is wonderful ! Helps eliminate the frizz and keep it looking shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> Immediately noticed a difference the first time i used it! Also, random stranger at the gym locker room noticed the lovely scent</li>
    <li> Great product, wonderful smell use it every time I wash my hair. Have very coarse hair that is dry that no matter what kind of conditioner I use it never provides enough moisture. after using this only once my hair has become much more manageable and I don&#x27;t worry nearly as much as i do when I straighten it as my hair before was too dry to style.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I am trying to grow my hair and it was getting to the point where I couldn&#x27;t comb it through with my hand (because of tangles). After just a few uses my hair is so silky and I am able to continue to grow hair. I highly recommend the hair mask.</li>
    <li> My hair was always super dry, dull and frizzy and leaving this product for 15 minutes in my hair once/twice a week makes wonders!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is brighter, smoother and now my curls really look like curls and not a frizzy mess anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw I also love the smell!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I have used the hair oil and Loved it!! This is the first time to try the hair treatment for my damaged hair. This was Amazing product than I expected. Very gently give nutrition to my hairs and make my hair glossy. You must try this item to keep your hair beautiful ;))</li>
    <li> smell really good, smooth. i like it a lot</li>
    <li> I really loved the way this product made my hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t anything different from a regular conditioner! nothing special!</li>
    <li> I have damaged hair from coloring and highlighting, also, from flat iron usage. I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners, they either don&#x27;t work well enough or actually leave my hair oily which is a bad thing. I tried this mask reading others reviews and I must say it is doing a fantastic job. My hair has a shine it hasn&#x27;t had in a long time, and it is soft to the touch. The weather has been very humid here and the frizz is very much under control! It smells great and I think it&#x27;s doing the job! I will repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect! I loved.</li>
    <li> Great Mask!! Amazing smell. My hair was very dry and brittle, this mask makes my hair feel very soft and manageable. Love it. Highly Recomended.</li>
    <li> Excellent Hair Mask..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives my dry hair firm and smooth without using any conditioner. Love it</li>
    <li> Works very well. Hydrates hair without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> My wife received a sample of this product and fell in love. I got it for her as a birthday gift and she was stoked! She loves how it feels and looks natural. Her hair has some slight frizz because it is not curly enough to be a curl. It is easy to use and makes a difference that is beyond noticeable!</li>
    <li> I have started to use this oil on my daughter as her hair gets really tangled and quite a pain to brush in the morning. I use a small amount after her washing and towel dry her hair and it made her hair much smoothier (and shiny) and easy to brush afterwards. She is quite sensitive to smells but really likes the smell of this brand argan oil as it is a light scent but very pleasant. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I LOVE HSI argon oil, it lasts forever, leaves my hair soft, shiny and NON greasy!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my hair. I will stick with Lanza it seems to work perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I use HSI Professional Argan Oil Leave in conditioner regularly. It leaves my hair soft and silky. My hair are non-greasy and light. I will keep on using this leave-in-conditiner.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It does not leave your hair feeling greasy. I have long thick hair and my hair feels silky after using it. I use a small amount on my dry hair right before I flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It leaves hair feeling smooth but not oily.  It also protects very well against humidity and helps with the frizzing.  It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> My review is for the Argan oil leave in conditioner. I have used a couple of bottles of this and absolutely love it! My hair is always soft and shiny despite use of heat products and hair dye.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Hair is smooth and tangle free. It&#x27;s very nice!</li>
    <li> I have use this hair mask twice and I could see the difference. it makes my hair soft and it smells really good. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and when I get a chance to try new products I get giddy. So when I was offered this product at a free / reduced price I definitely said yes! After just the first use of this product I fell in love with it. My hair was so much softer and even looked fuller. It was easy to manage and looked healthier than it has in a while. Due to being sick, on tons of medications and just having surgery, my hair isn&#x27;t what it use to be. It is almost to my waist and naturally wavy so it is a mess to comb and style. This product changed that. I will be using this all the time now. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous anti frizz treatments this is absolutely the best! Hair is so healthy!!!</li>
    <li> I love this entire product line.</li>
    <li> My transaction was easy and quick and I received the product just as fast.  I love the product and will order again in the future.  My hair feels alive again.  Love that its in a large size and I don&#x27;t have to reorder so often.</li>
    <li> I have course, wavy hair that takes a lot of effort to straighten.  I dont like my hair wavy but hate spending too much time straighten my hair.  This product is one of the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  After using this conditioner, my hair is soft and straighter than normal.  I can blow dry my hair straight or run the flat iron through it really fast.  I love this product and highly recommend this to anyone who wants soft, straight hair.</li>
    <li> Very good deep conditioner.  After a summer full of sun and chlorine,  this hair mask left both min3 and my daughter&#x27;s hair soft and manageable.  She has very curly ringlets that lend themselves to be frizzy,  but this helped her regain moisture.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Great product... Made my hair very managable and fully conditioned...</li>
    <li> I am on bottle number 2 of my Argan oil which is all I use now. I have very thick wavy hair but I like to wear it smooth and straight. This works for me very well on wet or dry hair. Plus -  I really love the scent of it</li>
    <li> Love this argan oil. It smells great too. I only need to use a little bit because I have fine curly hair, so it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> Tried to cancel order less than an hour later and they said it was already processed. It was not exactly what I needed. I tried it anyway and it didn&#x27;t work  on my hair</li>
    <li> I love this product! It does not weigh your hair down or take away your natural shine. I feel in the 4 months of using this leave in oil my hair is much healthier as well. The product also arrived in a timely manor. Overall I am extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy, thick hair and there were damages after coloring them. I then decided to use this hair mask and this has made my hair smooth by reducing frizz and don&#x27;t see much of damage or split ends. This also gives shine to my hair and retains moisture. The good thing about this is it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. I do straighten my hair and the styling time has been cut half. I tried this hair mask as i was using HSI PROFESSIONAL FLAT IRON to straighten my hair and i just loved the sample argon oil which came along with the straightener. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> pretty good but not my favorite. seems to weigh my hair down. occasional use</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair mask! It is so much better on my constantly dyed blonde hair! I have used the morrocan hair mask, the macadamia hair mask, along with several others but nothing else has helped like this one when it comes to my dry hair. I use this in combination with the HSI hair oil too. It works so well I have friends asking me what I&#x27;m using because my hair looks so much healthier.</li>
    <li> Great for my hair!  I love this stuff, it really makes my frizzy hair smoother.  You can use it on wet or dry hair!  Great service too!</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference on my hair after applying this hair mask and I applied it as instructed, as well I do not believe to haver read any ingredients related to Argan oil in the list. After drying my hair it did not feel different than usual, therefore I do not know if this really makes any improvements.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Using it on clean hair, help with minimizing breakage and split ends. This product is lightweight, gave shine, and minimized frizz. Only bad thing, straight styled lasted for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> HSI smoothing hair mask is amazing!  I&#x27;m always looking for products that will keep my hair hydrated and soft.  This stuff right here blew my expectations out of this world.  I was completely wrong about this product.  I use this mask twice a week at night.  My hair looks better, feels softer, and smells amazing.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I love the aragon oil! I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle. Fast shipping. Good product</li>
    <li> I loved this product! I had read good reviews about it before purchasing and haven&#x27;t been disappointed. It really protects the hair from heat and leaves it softer after use. Have recommended to my other friends as well.</li>
    <li> I tried many brand, local store and on line purchase.  This is the best one.  It also smell good.  Not like some other brand.  I&#x27;ll continue purchase this one from now on.</li>
    <li> My wife is still surprised at how soft her hair becomes each time she uses this product.  She had tried all kinds of salon and boutique brand conditioners. This stuff really,  actually works.  You can see and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> Will purchase this hair conditioner again!  Works well as a leave in and also a 20 minute conditioner that is rinsed out.</li>
    <li> Its a good product,  I expected softer/smoother hair after using it.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t right reviews ... But all I got to say ... AMAZING !!!</li>
    <li> I just received my hair mask today and I went straight to the shower! I washed my hair then applied this mask. Let me start out saying....this product smells absolutely incredible! I love the smell! After rinsing it out , I began drying and styling my hair as usual. Right off the bat, as I was drying my hair, I could tell the most amazing difference, My hair was incredibly soft to the touch, posed to my usual course, brittle, dry hair! I have hypothyroidism and it causes all those problems plus frizzed, damaged hair. My hair was so beautiful, soft, and radiant after drying and styling, I can&#x27;t believe the dramatic change! It&#x27;s like I have totally different hair! I definitely will be buying more of this and using it as often as I can! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I could see how this product might work for people with hair that is in better shape than mine. My hair is too over processed to really feel a significant difference.</li>
    <li> I was really satisfied with this product, it&#x27;s amazing and I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome! One of the best products that I have ever used f9r my overworked hair.</li>
    <li> Honestly makes a difference in the texture of my hair, from frizzy, dried out to silky and soft. Love this line of products!</li>
    <li> Great Product. Really works and gives a great shine and healthiness to the ahirs. Its Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had time to take care of my hair much. I must admit I am the type of woman who just always keeps her hair in a bun. Not because I&#x27;m lazy but my hair is just so damaged to let it let loose. I got excited when I received  this and I thought to myself it&#x27;s  about time to let my hair loose. I used it after shower and only left it for about 30mins. I remember my hairstylist before who told me that when you put treatment to your hair make sure to shampoo it first for best absorption. Just shampoo no conditioner. This removes all the residue from what you used beforehand and also the dusts and dirts. It smells like a lotion and the consistency is thick. It is actually best to put a hair cap and leave it there until you&#x27;re  ready to wash it. After that I just dried my hair with a fan. My hair feels so soft and I can see it&#x27;s shinier. I took a picture of before and after and you can see the difference. The damage is still there but it&#x27;s  starting to work. Of course I do not expect it to work that fast with just one use. I purchased this for a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. But it&#x27;s  worth it. Saves you money from going to salon to get your hair restored.</li>
    <li> PERFECTION! I use this stuff EVERY time i need to blow dry my hair. It makes my hair so freaking soft and silky. I go 1-2 years between hair cuts so this has helped prevent further damage to my hair. Its the only product i use on my hair and its all that i need! Highly highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This has made my hair soft and shiny  .Just a small amount is all that is needed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I put it on after washing my hair and it makes it soft and gets rid of most of the frizz. I have very greasy hair and this does not make it greasier, just soft and shiny but perfectly clean. Also, you only need a little at a time so this will last forever.</li>
    <li> This is really the best hair product I have come across. Smoothes and conditions your hair without making it greasy or going back to being a straw mat after you wash it out. My hair has become much healthier and softer since I started using this 4 months ago. It has also helped my hair grow out about another 1.5&amp;#34;-2&amp;#34; inches since its helped to prevent breakage (a big problem I encountered even with minimal processing, heat application, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things! Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Bought it based on other reviews and am very happy I did!  It is now part of my every day routine.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This stuff is salon quality, makes my hair very soft and manageable.  A little goes a long way. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I like this...I will be honest and say I only used it once, but will use the entire jar and update.  However, even after the first use I could see that my hair was different.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it felt supple, hair-commercial-quality bombtastic, but it was much shinier than I remember.  Full disclosure, I did just color my hair a week ago...sooooo....look back here for an end-of-jar update.  This is a HUGE tub and I got a discount to review it...so, give me a little bit of time for a full report.</li>
    <li> Good Excellent product and it is good packaging I really like it it is perfect for me. The product is good and good condition. This is the answer for my hair problem. I tried many product hair care and it does not work. My hair is dry, frizzy, because i colored my haire every 3 weeks. I had  a problem also in my scalp so I try this and it gives me good result. My hair looks shine and manageable. I just follow the directions of the product and everything goes smooth. Just happy and satisfied the product the product description is made  in U.S Super  Ssize  16 OZ! HSI PROFESSIONAL #1 best ARGAN OIL ANTI FRIZZ, HYDRATING SMOOTHING HAIR MASK. REVITALIZE, SMOOTHEN AND REPAIR ALL TYPES OF HAIR. UNRULY, COARSE, DAMAGED OR COLOR TREATED HAIR. I will highly recommend this product.  I got this with a good discount for product promotions in exchange of product reviews unbiased and honest one. All I can say is the product is great.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel so soft!</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent product. The hair looks amazing!</li>
    <li> When I got this jar in the mail I did the first thing everyone probably does. I opened it to smell it. The smell of this is sooooo good. I have had the chance to use it about 5 times now. I shampoo my hair, squeeze out all the water and throw a nice glob of this in it. It has a creamy thick texture and feels really luxurious going into your hair. I continue with my shower while I leave this on for 5 of so minutes. Once I rinse there isnt even a need to add conditioner to my hair. I have already started to notice a difference as my hair has some frizz in the dry damaged areas of my hair. My hair seems smoother and much more hydrated. If you have damaged hair from coloring or styling this is a great product to help reverse some of the damage.&lt;br /&gt;I DID RECEIVE THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST OPINION OF IT.</li>
    <li> Awesome product leave my hair very soft and shine. Love it. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I love it!</li>
    <li> The scent is a soapy scent, bar soap like the one that start with Z or D.  The scent does lingers after it rinses out but once your hair is dry the scent is gone so it does not interfere with you perfume. The product itself was only slightly thicker than typical conditioner. I&#x27;m a hair product nut. At this very moment, I have 5 sets of shampoo and conditioner in my shower. I used this as directed, applied liberally, used a wide tooth shower comb to evenly  distribute and kept it on for five minutes. It rinsed out easily. I expected my hair to feel super silky and tangle free but that was not the case. Hair felt soft but not super silky. After I blew dry and round brushed, my hair looked equal to other conditioners I use. I would say this is a conditioner result not a mask result. My hair combed out wet but it did have a few tangles that came out easily. Hair is as soft and shiny as my other conditioners. I was sent this product for a review, good or bad.</li>
    <li> Love how soft this made my hair. Much needed during this summer full of beach and pool times. This product is absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> I have added this to my wish list because I love HSI Professional company and their products are excellent. I use their products all of the time. I love the flat iron and hair sprays! And since my hair loses moisture, gets frizzy during the summer and completely dry during the winter, I have my hair swimming in homemade hair mask and store brought hair mask during these seasons, just to maintain it! Argan oil is one of the natural hair oils I rely on to keep my hair healthy, soft and shiny and with the HSI Professional quality, this hair mask would work extremely well to help keep my hair beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love HSI products!  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  I have started getting my hair streaked, which has dried it out and this product or any argan oil for that matter did not help a bit.  I asked my hair dresser and she suggested coconut oil.  I found coconut oil works the best for me and it&#x27;s really cheap.  Also good after a shower.</li>
    <li> Works similar to regular conditioner (a little stronger).  Did not deep condition as much as I expected.</li>
    <li> Great for your hair. Conditions your hair with out weighing it down or getting sticky.</li>
    <li> This is seriously on the best products I ever used.  I have a thick long hair, and this hair mask leaves my hair silky.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this in her hair.</li>
    <li> Great experience.  Just a little oil needed for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because I have blonde hair (bleached) and get my hair foiled every three months or so. Everyone knows that bleaching is really hard on the hair, especially when you are in your 50&#x27;s and have been doing it for years and years! This conditioner makes my hair manageable, soft and very well conditioned. It is definitely a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for anyone who colors or bleaches their hair. I use it everytime I wash my hair, which is every 2-3 days, as long as I have not been sweating excessively. Even if you used it every day, it would not weigh your hair down, like many conditioners do.</li>
    <li> So far I like it, my hair is soft and shiny after I use it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask and so does my hair!  My hair was in big trouble and using this has made my hair look happier.  It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my hair! I started taking swimming lessons this summer and the chlorine made my hair so frizzy. After using this product I noticed an immediate improvement. I am definitely buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> This hair care product was a nice surprise for me.  My color treated hair is fine and tends to be a little frizzy and fly-away but the argan oil in this product corrected that problem.  A little product usage here goes a long way which is another plus.   And my hair smells really nice after using HSI Professional.  I definitely recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> I used this on my daughters hair and it worked wonders for her curly tresses. She has kinky hair that absorbs everything we put in it. This product left her hair moisturized and shiny after being flat ironed.</li>
    <li> Great product. Adds moisture to chemically treated hair. I do no need a leave in conditioner  after using this product.  Very light weight and does not weigh your hair down. My hair is medium length and is chemically treated. This worked well for me.</li>
    <li> This has made my hair shiny and frizz free  I even gave a friend of mine some and it made her hair soft, manageable and shiny. I would recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> First time I used it, I found no benefit. Next time, I left it on over night....still no benefit.</li>
    <li> Great product with good price. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months and noticed the improvement of my hair. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I give this a 5 star because it&#x27;s great stuff . I also have the shampoo and conditioner plus the leave in spray conditioner and the oil treatment . I love the smell and the feel of my hair after using all of this stuff . Please come out with a repair line . I would recommend this to everyone . I found out about this from my daughter as she also uses this product . I just love it !!!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much!  I leave it in my shower so I will use it... If it&#x27;s in a cupboard, I forget to use it...  I use it prior to washing my hair as a mask, leaving it on for as long as I can, then I also use it as a conditioner after shampooing...  My hair feels soft and looks shinny!  I think it keeps my color-processed hair in great condition!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already seen an improvement on my hair and had compliments from family saying they can see the difference too. I&#x27;m excited to keep using this product!</li>
    <li> I use it after conditioning once per week, to untangle my hair and heat protector, and once a month or every two weeks I live it on the whole night and rinse it in the morning, combined with a cleansing shampoo it has help my hair a lot. A stylist completely messed my hair and I had to go through 5 chemical processes in a week after all that damage, this is being helpful to restore the silkiness of my hair.</li>
    <li> HSI products never disappoint. Adds moisture and protection with no buildup.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing for me my hair tends to be dry and breaks off. For someone who wears long hair this is a huge no no. This product has changed the condition of my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It makes my hair really soft and manageable. I was Nicely surprised at the difference it made. I use it as a deep conditioning mask at least once a week. Plus it came quick too!</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a change in my hair after using this product. My hair is not nearly as frizzy once I use this and I absolutely love the smell of it!  I also like that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after using it.</li>
    <li> My hair was so dry from flat ironing and I was just about to cut it off. As a last ditch effort I bought this and WOW! This stuff is amazing. I use it once a week and have had no issues since. It makes my hair soft and it actually styles easier than ever before. Customer for life :)</li>
    <li> This hair mask is good to use. My hair is general dry and not very smooth. I bought this and hoped it make my hair more shiny and smooth. It does well so far. The first several times, I just used it as regular hair conditioner. It didn&#x27;t make too much difference. But when I try to wear it longer with relative dry hair, it makes my hair smoother.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product once a week for almost 2 month. My hair used to be very dry, by using this product, my hair looks much better. I am very pleased with the purchase!</li>
    <li> My hair is Asian textured that is dyed every 3 to 4 weeks to cover gray hair. This product is my go to deep hair conditioner. It works amazing! After coloring, I leave it on for 15 minutes and my hair is revived back to it&#x27;s shiny and healthy state. A little goes a long way. Shipping was fast as well. I will definitely continue using this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> Loved the results I got! Less frizziness and my hair feels soft and smooth. It also smells very good.  I left it in for 10 mins and applied heat then rinsed with cold water. I didn&#x27;t have to use very much and still have a large amount left. I will be doing a treatment every other week. Directions could be a little more clear (says 5 mins and rinse or 15 mins and apply heat but does not mention rinse). I received a discount for this product in return for a review.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Really nourishing for the hair. My hair was much softer after I used it. I would definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> It has been very good so far for 2 weeks. Both me and my wife use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and I we both have thick curly hair and I work wonders I love the way I leave our hair I cant wait to try the rest of your products I just order the shampoo and conditioner also would like to try the leave in conditioner</li>
    <li> Makes my hair silky and stylish my curls.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Frist I must confess that I was an EXCLUSIVE WEN user. A closet full of the stuff! On chance this HIS brand popped up when I was purchasing a flat iron. I added to my cart. Boy, oh boy do I love this entire line! This hair mask is even BETTER than Wen’s 58.00 hair mask! It leaves your hair shinny and so healthy! I have since purchased the whole line and absolutely love it! Give a try, you won’t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed and has very curly, dry hair.  I treated her hair with HSI&#x27;s hair mask and it completely detangled her hair and made it feel extremely soft.  I am always looking for a good product, and I&#x27;ve found one.  I&#x27;m interested in trying other HSI products.  I use their straightening iron and I LOVE it!  It&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t catch pieces of hair in the corners and rip them out. Great products and a trustworthy company.</li>
    <li> Love it! Definitely made my hair smoother and less frizzy. Smells nice too!</li>
    <li> You know those hair treatment masks you buy in little packets at Sally&#x27;s and other beauty shops? Usually several dollar each, put it on your hair, let it sit, wash out? This is pretty much those, only a far better value because you get a huge tub. Huge. 16oz huge, in fact. Within it is a dense, whitish, nice-smelling lotion-y substance that you smear on your hair, let sit, and wash out. My hair was shinier and healthier-looking afterwards, and the effect lasted for several days. Excellent stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review. I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review. If you don&#x27;t believe me, click my profile and scroll down to see the poor reviews I&#x27;ve given bad products. My job is to give an honest opinion, not help the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, she is in absolute love with it. The results of smoothing hair mask is clearly visible, leaves the hair shiny and smooth if you have thick curly hair -  this is a great solution to keep the hair softer smooth.</li>
    <li> My hair is loving this and definitely can feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I am very particular to my hair because I have been having issues with dryness, dandruff and falling hair (I know sounds horrible, I just gave birth so hormones are imbalanced). I tried this to give justice to my hair and make it softer. It works well if you will leave it longer before rinsing. I try to use my hand to remove tangles and cover it for 10 minutes. I love the smell and really made my hair smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I got this at a promotional rate to give opinion on the product. I highly recommend this one plus its super size so you can use it over and over.</li>
    <li> This mask works really well in making my hair feel smooth and conditioned!</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  I GOT THIS FOR MY BEST FRIEND BECAUSE SHE HAS VERY, VERY, VERY DRY HAIR.  SHE HAS USED IT TWICE.  HER HAIR LOOKS 100% BETTER.  THIS STUFF IS A MIRACLE WORKER.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> This review is going to be based on the Ingredients and My Personal Experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance at first opening is a little too &amp;#34;Perfumy&amp;#34; for me. But I wanted to try it out anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I am caucasian. I have waist length, thick brown hair. My skin is darker complected and not sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I used about a Tbs to coat and comb through my hair. I followed the directions. I actually let it set between 10 and 15 min then rinsed.  I 95% of the time leave my hair to air dry. It left my hair with a residue and looked unwashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an AVID buyer of Natural and Organic, Argan Oil Based Products. I know this is not claiming to be Natural Or Organic BUT There is Barely any Argan Oil in this jar. It is listed as one of the last ingredients. You are not getting True Argan Oil Benefits. There are even better products out there that don&#x27;t use Synthetic Ingredients. Check out Giovanni.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to read Ingredients.(pic)&lt;br /&gt;While many of them really aren&#x27;t too alarming I will admit. About half way through reading Ingredients you start seeing Polysorbates. Which are Synthetic, made in a jar, and are a known Carcinogen in Animal Lab testing. After you get past the Polysorbates, a ways further you get Propylene Glycol. This is an active ingredient in antifreeze. It is known to penetrate the skin. The EPA wears protective gear when handling it. Why would anyone want that on their head, even if it is just a tiny amount?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where does the ingredient, Argan Oil fall?  31st out of 44 Total Ingredients. AFTER the Polysorbates and AFTER the Propylene Glycol.&lt;br /&gt;This product just isn&#x27;t for me. If I were able to see the ingredients list, I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want negativity, I just want honesty. I think everyone should be able to see what is in it and decide what is best for them.&lt;br /&gt;*received a discount in return for my honest review</li>
    <li> I use it as a leave in conditioner.  It leaves my hair soft and not frizzy. You just have to be careful not to use too much or it will weight your hair down. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> this is a great product...my hair seems shiny and smooth after using. I will be this again.</li>
    <li> Works great and last a very long time! A little goes a long way. I use it after towel drying hair. I am 41 years old and it helps my hair to be more smooth and manageable!! Love it. My 13 year old daughter also loves it for straightening her hair.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for my mom who has frizzy hair. She loves it. Very thick and nourishing. And it is 16 ounces!</li>
    <li> My hair was dry due to years of color treatment. This hair mask revitalized my hair and made it soft and glossy again.</li>
    <li> Great product Makes my hair soft</li>
    <li> I am so happy I stumbled upon this product!  My hair is colored, styled with heat (blow dryer,hair straightener,curling iron) and I also spend the better part of the summer outside in the pool in the Arizona sun.  Needless to say, by this time of the year my hair is pretty much a head full of straw.  After I used this product, my hair felt like it was brand new!  Almost as soft as my grand-babies hair!  This stuff is a miracle! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  If you have not tried these products you need to try them right away they are wonderful.</li>
    <li> This has made my hair feel amazing! I will be continuing using this product. Arrived quick also.</li>
    <li> This is posted under my husband&#x27;s account, but it is for me...his wife...he is bald and does not need it.  I do need it.  AND I LOVE IT! I have long, straight hair with frizz issues from over straightening.  I usually put this on and let it sit on my hair for 3-5 min...then I only lightly rinse it out.  I LOVE IT!  It has really tamed my frizz factor.</li>
    <li> So glad I tried this, don&#x27;t hesitate.  It&#x27;s a great deal and leaves your hair feeling soft, shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> This has turned out to be one of my all time hair favorites.  Its not too heavy, I love the way my hair feels when I dry it, and I love the smell.  I am a definite re-order customer!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!!!!! Arrived fast and absolutely love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Did the job. Hair is sily with straightener</li>
    <li> Too waterly therefore can&#x27;t moisturelize your hair. Feel very dry after using it...</li>
    <li> I have some pretty dry and damaged hair on the top layer from styling. I used this today and left in on for about 10 minutes. While it didn&#x27;t totally reverse the damage (that would be a miracle) my hair showed noticeable improvement. I can&#x27;t wait to feel my hairs texture after a few more uses. UPDATE:  I have been using this Soothing Hair Mash once to Twice a week for a few months now.  The results have been amazing!  My hair is so much softer and way more manageable after using this stuff regularly.  I wish I had known about it a lot sooner!</li>
    <li> Long, thick curly hair. Oh yes, sounds so ideal. It is, until you have to deal with it, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my hair but not caring for it. The first thing I noticed with HSI Professional Hair Mask was the scent, pleasing but not perfumed like a drug store purchase. This smells like a salon product, not a dollar store purchase. I gave my hair about an ounce and a half of product and massaged in in from the ends up and gave myself the excuse to soak in a hot bath for awhile. I rinsed the product out but I was not meticulous in doing so, as with curly hair, leaving a little in isn&#x27;t a bad thing. I styled as usual and smooth, soft and frizz free curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the rich moisturiziers in this hair mask, make sure to cleanse your skin, especially your face so you don&#x27;t find your skin unexectedly out of balance. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, after just a few uses my hair is in much better shape, not dry, not oily, but just more healthy looking and feeling.</li>
    <li> Great product, leaves hair shiny with bounce, substantially reduces frizz. Super fast ship. Great transaction!!</li>
    <li> I work in a nursing home and intend to use this on my residents, after feeling how amazing it left my hair! it&#x27;s a huge amount also! great for dry brittle hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily looking&lt;br /&gt;i was sent this product for review</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Moisturizes, smoothes and strengthens my healthy hair very well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other salon hair masks and this by far the best! And it&#x27;s 16OZ! IT&#x27;S HUGE! Just try it!</li>
    <li> The best ever !! I love it !! After trying many products for my damaged hair, I finally found the one product that has quickly made a huge difference, and my hair looks beautiful. Thank you so much for a great product and service....Karla</li>
    <li> If you have frizzy hair issues get this. Seriously. It works MIRACLES! I have for the first time in years been able to wear my hair product free other than this. LOVE!</li>
    <li> I use this sparingly since a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My first time trying this oil.  I liked it a lot.  The smell was very good and it did the trick on making my hair smooth and frizz free without looking oily.</li>
    <li> Really a great product. Service is great and delivered on time. Concerned about their customers. 1000% satisfied.</li>
    <li> I work good for my hair. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Bought this to take with me and two friends on a Korean Spa day out.  You spend multiple hours with your hair in chlorinated water and then in hot saunas.  The three of us all used this for the last thirty minutes and our hair felt awesome.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going with a longer, sleeker hairstyle for the summer. All of our time spent outdoors in the sun and water has left my hair dried out and thirsty for moisture. This argan oil hair mask has helped provide quenching relief plus added smoothness and shine. There&#x27;s a reason argan oil has become such a fad, it really does wonders for your hair (and skin), plus a little goes a long way. You&#x27;re supposed to put this in for five minutes and rinse it out, but honestly I prefer to leave it in overnight or even brush a little through my dry locks to tame them and bring them back to shiny perfection. Just don&#x27;t overdo it or you&#x27;ll end up with a greasy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have done so much to my hair recently that it looked so frizzy, damaged and just very ugly. With a desperate attempt to revitalize it, i bought this hair mask.  I must say it helped. But it is temporary.  I also use the leave-in conditioner from the same brand and 1-2 pumps help tamey frizzy hair a bit better.</li>
    <li> Smells terrific and made my frizzy hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Got a sample of this previously and ordered a full bottle.  This stuff works really well, makes my hair dry much faster whether I am going for straight or curly, and smooths my ends well.  Also smells amazing- the smell lingers, but is very light.  Nice texture, thick enough to spread through hair well. A little goes a long way- I have very thick, just past the shoulder length hair, and I use this every day and am only through a about a 1/4 to 1/3 of the bottle after months of use.  I use it by itself for curly days, and mix with a bit of smoothing cream and gel for straightening days, though it also works well by itself for straightening.  Apply before heat styling, or air drying, and then smooth ends a bit with a tiny bit more on dry hair. Only complaint is that the bottle is not good for travel- the cap doesn&#x27;t get super tight.  If you travel a lot you will want to get a better travel container to funnel some into.</li>
    <li> This has proved to be an extreme product delivering all my expectations in one bottle of Argan oil leave in conditioniner I usually apply the product on my white/grey hair and am very very pleased with the smooth and silky result.  Nor does the oil yellow the hair.  In fact the silkiness and the beautiful aroma it leaves on the hair is comparable to none.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend and will always have it as a staple on my beauty counter.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and I color it all the time. Since I color it the dying process dries out my hair and makes it feel dry...to the point where I can here it if it rustles by my ear. Since I&#x27;ve started using this argan oil by HSI my hair seems to be moisturized and softer. I love this stuff and reccomend it to all my friends.  I also loved how quick I received my product and. Great customer service :)</li>
    <li> I very much enjoyed this product. It protected my hair from the heat and it was noticeably softer after use. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> It gave me a great experience. My hair became smoother and soft, and I only used it on the end of my hair to prevent too much conditioner on my root of hair.</li>
    <li> It actually works!  I use it every other day and my hair is sooo soft.  I also use argan oil every morning but that only seemed to be staving off the dryness.  This mask has actually made my hair unbelievably soft.  Like the way it was when I was a kid.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair with split ends, so I was looking for something that would bring back some life into my dull lifeless hair.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the HSI hair mask along with their shampoo and have been using it for a month now. This hair mask does work pretty great if you leave it one for at least 7-10 minutes in the shower. Please note,don&#x27;t use it like a regular conditioner, because that will not yield any results, you are just wasting the product. You need to leave it in for a considerable amount of time and let it work its magic. It really makes your hair beautiful and smooth. As with all thick hair masks, this will weigh your hair down a bit , so be prepared for that. It cannot permanently fix dry hair, but will make it nice and smooth whenever you use it.</li>
    <li> My product arrived on time and I use it regurlarly.It smells great and leaves my hair very soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Works great on thin hair, as well, and does not weigh it down.</li>
    <li> This review is for a great product that I loved so much that I offered to a good friend. She loves it too! It truly smooths unruly hair!! Not an easy task when you have frizzy hair but this truly helps! I use it after every wash and  then let my hair dry and they don&#x27;t become all puffy :) My friend uses it before flat ironing her hair and she really likes how it protects her hair from the damaging heat. Great product!! Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend. Use this all the time and the bottle is still 3/4 full so don&#x27;t even worry about getting your money&#x27;s worth. You will. On top of that, your hair is silky smooth. Feels perfectly conditioned and healthy. I&#x27;ve tried other oils but most of them weigh my hair down with its thickness. Nothing quite compares to this.</li>
    <li> I enjoy HSI products and buy them all the time. They make my hair look very shiny and combing wet hair is easy and not painful at all.</li>
    <li> I had a small issue company was awesome. Fast to resolve. Was very happy with them. Product is awesome have been using it and it makes my hair so beautiful and soft. First product to do that.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair mask twice already. I love this mask. It smells so good and conditions my hair so it doesn&#x27;t look so dry. I color my hair so it is very dry and this mask has helped a lot. I could see my hair shine with this. I would recommend this hair mask it is perfect for all types of hair. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> The hsi  argon oil with thermal guard is my go to product. I have blond wavey hair that gets very frizzy. Sometimes it looked wild and dry. I have tried many products without sucess. I ordered this and it works wonders on my hair. I concentrate on the ends first then from my ears down. It works best with heat. I did not get great results air drying. You can also smooth some on after blowdrying to finish it off. I brought it to work so a co worker could try it and she ordered it also. It is not greasy, just smooth and shiney&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; have tried many products. I am very pleased with this and I have shared it with others to try</li>
    <li> This product is working very well. It has been leaving my hair healthy and smooth. It works a lot better then some of these other products in the market that promise the same thing.</li>
    <li> I do like this product. I find if I use too much in my hair, it becomes frizzy.I have curly hair, so I am very cautious with hair products. If the product is too heavy, my hair can look extremely greasy.I use this product before I flat iron my hair. This argan oil is lightweight and does an amazing job! It makes my hair much, much more shiny and silky. My hair is easier to style. A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t be heavy handed. Smells so great!!</li>
    <li> I really like the fragrance of HSI and I love how my hair looks and feels after using the mask. Defiantly will buy again.</li>
    <li> What an intense deep conditioning masque! This product is superb! My hair is over processed and very brittle, dry and damaged from the irons I use and hair dryers. So when I used this I was almost pessimistic about whether or not this would actually have any real significance on my hair. Low and behold, it surely did. My hair felt so smooth and frizz free after using this product. I honestly cannot remember the last time it has this amount of bounce and felt so good. Perhaps, during my last pregnancy, when my nails, hair were at their best. But not since then. I love the scent of this deep conditioner and I did not have to use a ton to achieve the soft and silky hair that I once knew. I spend an enormous amount of money on my hair every year, searching for the &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; product to help rehydrate the damage that I inflict on it. I look no father at this point. This smoothing hair mask is AMAZING! I will be a repeat customer for sure, and because I have three lovely daughters, I will have to buy gallons of this :)</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t a Brazilian Blowout, but it is close. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat the quality you get in the product. I have very long hair (down to my butt). This product tames my naturally wavy hair, but also has seemed to have reversed the sun damage. I am out in the sun a lot and this product is great to put in and go! I enjoy the smell, even pregnant, and the manageability I have since using it.</li>
    <li> i got this for FREE and i love it. i have used this once and wow.i will be updating the post but it starting working right off the bat.soft silly hair with the first try.so far this gets a 10 pf of 10</li>
    <li> This is the first conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve done on my hair this year (yes, I realize it&#x27;s August, but life has been crazy!) and, as you can see in the before picture, I desperately needed it. I also need a trim, but I do not cut my own hair. A big chunk of the reason I haven&#x27;t done a treatment in so long is because they&#x27;re usually very long and involved. This one is not. There are 2 options. You can leave it in for 5 minutes and rinse, or for 15 minutes and apply heat. I opted for the 5 minutes because commiting to 15 minutes of anything straight is just not possible at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was doing pretty well before that. I take care to use good shampoo and conditioner, I don&#x27;t wash it every day and I use argan oil whenever I wash, straighten or blow out my hair, but I definitely see an improvement. Yeas, I have the pictures to show it, but if you could have felt my hair before and after, THAT is where the big difference is. It&#x27;s baby soft and smooth. It&#x27;s got its shine back. It even moves differently. Even with my long hair, I still have a MINIMUM of 7 more treatments in the jar. It really is super sized. I may use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair before she goes back to school, if she can be still for a whole 5 minutes. This is going to last a good while. It works well, it&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s easy and it&#x27;s convenient. Oh! And it smells nice, too. No chemical or plastic-like smell at all. Very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST, FAIR AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN. I HAVE IN NO WAY BEEN COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER ENTITY ASIDE FROM SAID DISCOUNT*</li>
    <li> Great product, great price! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, and it leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Been using the product for 2 years. Great to tame hair on humid days, makes flat ironing stay longer. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best leave-in argan oils that I have used. It rejuvenated my dry hair,and made it so soft.</li>
    <li> great stuff for making your hair shiny and smooth</li>
    <li> Really like this product...makes my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> Great product - makes my damaged hair feel soft after just a few occasional uses. I just leave it in for five minutes in the shower then rinse it out.</li>
    <li> Great product! Stopped using the product I had been using for years! It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy!</li>
    <li> I loved the oil and the price!</li>
    <li> Great product, great results!</li>
    <li> Amazing product smell so good i will keep ordering</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of times. I actually have a lot of flyaways on both sides and along hairline. This mask does make those softer. I apply the mask on my hair except for the scalp and leave it for 15 minutes. I guess I need to continue using more often to see the result. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I purchased the argan oil with the pump along with the hair straightener. I love the products and use them all the time!!!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this Argan oil. This is one of the best products that I have found to keep my hair healthy and smooth!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this HSI Hair Mask twice.  I don&#x27;t even wait to run out of it before placing the next order.  I loved the result event after leaving my hair wet and curly and received compliments during my trip to Punta Cana, DR.  It even works really well with the Flat Iron.  I ordered all the HSI Professional wet line now 3 times and love the result every time!</li>
    <li> Perfect for taming thick curly hair.  It helps fight frizz.  I use it as a conditioner, leaving it in a good 10 minutes before rinsing.  I look forward to trying other HSI hair products containing argan oil.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair soft and straight. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Smells good, smoothens and treats the hair well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other wash for about a month now, and it&#x27;s definitely made my hair noticeably softer and shinier. I really like the smell too. Would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing hair mask.  Since I started using it, my hair has been more glossy and full of body.&lt;br /&gt;I am very fussy about how my hair looks and know that healthy looking hair is the most attractive look.&lt;br /&gt;Going forward, this will be my choice of hair mask.&lt;br /&gt;( I have  been using hair masks for over 30 years)</li>
    <li> It works perfect for me. I recommend this for my ladies.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy dry hair that is hard to style.  I leave it on for five minutes in the shower while I shave.  It rinses out leaving my hair soft and tangle free. This mask  tamed my frizz and made it easy to blow dry into smooth waves.  My new favorite product.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this stuff- says it&#x27;s better than Kerastase!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I went to a salon to bleach out my dark hair twice in two weeks in attempt to achieve highlights however, my hair color did not lift. The bleaching process made my silky soft hair stiff.  I used this hair mask while I was in Oregon and I can tell that it made my hair softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> (Wife purchase) My hair is naturally curly and is seriously damaged due to years of straightening and coloring. I was skeptical when I purchased the product at first because I thought my hair was helpless. After using it, I am definitely a believer. The product makes my hair softer and shinier. I can totally see the difference in my hair now compared to when I used the Moroccan oil product. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I use it mostly in the shower, but on really humid days use it before using my straightener.  My hair is smooth and no frizz!</li>
    <li> One of the main ingredient is &amp;#34;Paraffinum Liquidum&amp;#34; in other words, 100% Mineral Oil, a byproduct when producing motor oil.... It is stripping on the hair and stinks on top of that.... I see now that none of the reviews are from verified buyers either, going to try to get my money back since this is a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t feel &amp; see much difference using this or any other hair conditioner that you have to leave in for 5 min or longer, I really expected more.</li>
    <li> Loved it, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product great company</li>
    <li> I loved this oil! It made my hair feel soo soft and it didn&#x27;t feel greasy. I definitely would recommend this oil!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!! Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and after using it for a couple of months, my hair was smoother with less split ends. I usually blow dry my hair after using it and this protects it very well. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Hi friends I bought this product. It&#x27;s really amazing . It works good while using heater</li>
    <li> This oil has been great for my hair! I use it before flat ironing and a couple of times on my ends during the week. I will be purchasing this oil in the future and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my two daughters.  One has thick curly hair and the other has fine straight hair.  I use this on both of them and their hair is more manageable, less tangles and their hair looks healthy and shiny.  I would recommend this product to others with both types of hair as it does help ease frizziness and reduce tangles.  It also has a light pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> That argan oil was received in a very timely manner. My hair is super thick and coarse and I am always looking for a product that will help it be smoother without getting oily. This product helped the smoothness and did not give me greasy hair!</li>
    <li> It smells good and makes my hair shine, but I think it is a little greasy for me.</li>
    <li> I use the leave in oil and prefer it to the other brands, and I have tried a lot. Try it you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair and this is the only product that has been able to tame it. I use it to soften my hair or as a heat protectant before I straighten it. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I LOVE HSI Leave-In Argan Oil!! I gave up on the thought that my hair would ever be soft and shiny again. I have been dying my hair for over 20 years and it has been dull and dry. I have tried every expensive, salon quality shampoo and conditioner and still my hair was just ok. With this product, people stop me on the street and my friends have all asked me what I am doing. I am happy to tell them my &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34;! I use as directed. I no longer use conditioner. After I shower, I apply a good amount all over my hair and then blow dry. I then apply some more and flat iron. I do not have an HSI flat iron yet, I am just using my old CHI. And, my hair looks like it did when I was in my 20&#x27;s. I can only imagine what it would look like with an HSI flat iron! I highly recommend this!! And, I HAVE to anyone who asks!! :)</li>
    <li> Fantastic product....would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Great product! Builds up my curls and takes off the frizz. Also lasts several days. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> From the moment I tried this, I knew I was going to like this product. The smell is great, certainly not overpowering. As soon as I rinsed it out of my hair, my hair felt like silk, and continued to feel silky for the next couple of days. Haven&#x27;t tried it on dry hair, but after reading several other reviews, I&#x27;m going to have to try it. Very Happy with this hair mask.</li>
    <li> My hair is soon dry. This product is awesome</li>
    <li> This is the best hair mask I ever had. I feel my hair silky and healthy. You can notice the change even after the first use.</li>
    <li> After I reached a certain age, my previously soft wavy hair sadly turned to thinned, dry, breakable, un-stylable frizz. No hair product in my cabinet worked anymore. Argan oil only tamed the frizz if I used enough to leave it stringy and greasy. Not the desired effect at all!  I gave up on my hair until the emergency - huge family wedding on the horizon, no time to lose. I went to to Amazon rather than play Russian roulette at a brick and mortar store.  Amazon reviews for this HSI hair mask were great, so I broke down and bought it despite a higher price than I was usually willing to spend on a hair product. I first tried it on wet hair right after a shower, as per the label instructions - but for whatever reason, my frizz actually worsened so much that my whole head of hair became a sticky, awful mass. My brush caught repeatedly in unprecedented tangles. Misery! I resolved to return it.  But wait - I remembered a few people&#x27;s reviews mentioned success when used on dry hair instead of wet, opposite to the labeled instructions. I decided to try it. This time, I was very pleased with the results!  I towel-dried my (long) hair after a shower, then blow-dried on low heat just enough to leave the ends a teeny bit damp. I then applied the mask to the ends, away from roots, as a leave-in conditioner. After a quick, high-heat blowdry, my hair softened beautifully and even held an actual style. I found it softened and smoothed my frizz even on humid or rainy days. On days when I didn&#x27;t wash my hair, a bit of this mask on the fuzzy sections followed by a boar-bristle brushing softened and styled it.  Since it works and it&#x27;s a good 16 oz. size that will last a long time, I don&#x27;t at all mind having spent a little more than usual on this product!  Disclosure: There is a possibility that I may receive a promotional bottle of this product if this review is posted on Amazon. However, my review is my unbiased opinion, based on actual results I experienced.and made it stylable. Unlike argan oil, this cream didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or leave it stringy or greasy. So, I can now say it is a great leave-in conditioner on dry hair in cases like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it works and it&#x27;s a good 16 oz. size that will last a long time, I don&#x27;t at all mind having spent a little more than usual on this product.</li>
    <li> I liked the smell, but the results were not what I expected.  I used the entire container, giving the product a chance to do its job.  Sadly, it made little to no difference on my hair.  Not to say this product won&#x27;t work for someone else, it just did not do anything for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month and my hair has never looked better.  Now that I&#x27;m older, my hair has become dry and coarser than it was. This mask has made it shiny and smooth again. Love this product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask!  When I use it, my hair feels stronger and silkier. Sometimes I will use it as a quick conditioner---maybe keep it on for 5 minutes in the shower. Other times, I will use it as a deep conditioner. I put a plastic cap on my head after applying, and let it sit for 30 minutes. You can tell it is very good for your hair. I highlight my hair and it is long, so it is important to keep it well conditioned. This mask helps me to keep my hair in good shape! Plus, it smells very good!</li>
    <li> The scent is subtle and lovely! My hair is quite dry and I use this mostly right now as a leave in conditioner. I apply it while my hair is wet. My hair never feels oily or greasy, it just soaks it up. I know it&#x27;s intended for flat iron use, but I&#x27;m using it as a protecting conditioner. It&#x27;s nice to know it will also protect my hair when I use my flat iron. This is my second bottle!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This wonderful product protects my hair from the effects of using a flat iron.  When I started using a flat iron my hair stylist was worried about it drying out my hair. I only need to use a small amount each time even with my thick hair!!  I would highly recommend HSI Argan Oil and I love my HSI flat iron, too!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  This leave-in hair treatment with argan oil keep the hair nice and smooth all day and it works really well with HSI professional flat iron!! I also love the smell too! I&#x27;ll highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> My fiancée has loved this and she has been very impressed with the way it has changed her hair. It is much easier to style and manage throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This product works fantastic with my HSI Flat iron. Leaves my hair shiny and silky and has a light, pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> It worked great! Hair became much more smooth after the application of the oil.</li>
    <li> If you want your hair to shine and get tons of compliments this product is for you. the company is good to its word in every aspect. I sent gifts to my daughters and they too are sold on it. It&#x27;s 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Works wonderful!</li>
    <li> My loves it and uses it often and will be getting more, Says it is nice and leave hair soft and manageable and you can leave it in which is a gret asset also as many of these you have to wash out,  Highly recommend,</li>
    <li> I really like this! Not only is it HUGE! but a little goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light scent, and washes out really easy! Leaving your hair soft, hydrated and silky smooth! I put a little bit in my plams, rub into the ends of my hair. (You only need to condition your ends) and rinse out 15min later. Towel dry my hair, and no frizzy, flyaways, or dry damaged looking hair here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided</li>
    <li> Very good product, I love it..</li>
    <li> Excellent for wet or dry hair. Leaves hair soft and shiny. I flat iron daily and have not had any of the past dry, breaking ends. I use this oil daily and will mix with the paste when hair is wet. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and will get this again.&lt;br /&gt;Great description, fast delivery. Great customer care. Really appreciate it.</li>
    <li> This line is different-very light and not greasy which is important to me as I have very straight Asian hair which very greasy quickly.. Very happy with this purchase.. Will definitely purchase again..a little goes a long way..</li>
    <li> Great Product! Really ads texture, bounce, and shine!</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is phenomenal! It smells so good and it does the job without weighing down your hair. It gives your hair the high gloss look without making your hair look overly oiled and dirty. It also makes the most rough and untamable hair more manageable. This is my first purchase and I plan to make this product a regular in my cabinet. There&#x27;s really no other product that can match the results you get.</li>
    <li> Was great. Leaves my hair feeling renewed and not greased residue. I highly recommend it:)</li>
    <li> This product is amazing !!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Leaves my hair soft and shiny.  My son has tried to steal it!  I&#x27;m tired of buying the newest and &amp;#34;greatest&amp;#34; product to come out, and wasting my money on expensive products that don&#x27;t do what they claim.. THIS IS the greatest and does what it says.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes and makes my hair feel so soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. The product works best when my hair is damp/wet &amp; I let it dry on its own. This minimizes flyaways. It does a great job untangling my hair so I&#x27;ve stopped using conditioner. My hair is down to my waist &amp; is pretty thick, but I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product. This bottle lasts me about 5-6 months with daily use. Definitely a great bargain for the price. I didn&#x27;t give a full 5 stars since the product does give my hair flyaways when applied to my dry hair &amp; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cruelty free (no animal testing). I&#x27;m also unsure if this is pure argan oil or if it&#x27;s argan infused. If these items were improved, then I would give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> My hair is gorgeous!  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments since I started using this!</li>
    <li> I used this product almost a month now and i notice that my hair becomes more healthier. This product works great for my fine hair and it becomes more thicker. Some of the products are too strong to handle but this is different. It makes my hair smooth and shiny (because of the Argan Oil). I stop using leave-on conditioner or mousse. I highly recommended this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  Made my hair feel like silk.</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair dry and frizzy, but using this hair mask 2 times a week has changed the texture of my hair and has helped with the breakage. I love it!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and controls my frizz like no other product I&#x27;ve used. I use it in the shower and also add some to my hair after I towel dry it to help it remain under control. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I received this hair mask in prompt fashion, well packed, as I soon as I got it I was impressed with the size of it, it is about 20 to 30% more product than what you usually get in the store, the jar looks nice, the smell of the hair mask is very appealing, and the texture of it is rich and creamy, I wash my hair after swimming in the pool, so my hair was pretty dried and crunchy, salt water is very harsh on hair, I applied the product and combed it thru my hair with ease, the instructions called for 5min after comb thru hair or 15 min in extreme dryness, I picked 5, the product rinsed out with ease and my hair felt great, I dried my hair with a blow dryer and it came out shiny and bouncy, not heavy or greasy, and no fly always either. I would definitely recommend this product and I will buy it in the future when I run out, this one I got in exchange of my honest opinion and review</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of HSI Smoothing Hair Mask. I have course hair and after leaving this in for 5 minutes, as directed, my hair feels soft and looks much more smooth. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> HSI Professional&#x27;s Soothing Hair Mask is a woman&#x27;s must have and one should not leave home without using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have frizzy and dull hair after deciding not to have my hair rebonded anymore. It&#x27;s dry and plagued with split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this gave my hair sheen, volume, and &amp;#34;life&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It minimized my split ends, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have more confidence going out because my crowning glory has been &amp;#34;resurrected from the dead&amp;#34; and my hair stays that way the entire day - no sticky, yucky feeling from ordinary leave-on conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this discounted product in consideration for my impartial review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont mind paying in full for my next jar!</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY hair products that promise softer, silkier hair, but until HSI, have been disappointed. The only reason I would take one star off, is that when I have it on my hair without straightening it, my hair feels a little sticky. After using the straightener, though, I love the way my hair looks and feels. One of the reviews I read started that it changed her hair from frizzy and coarse, to silky and shiny. I was hopeful for that, but have not experienced it as yet. I will definitely continue to buy this product for my hair. :)</li>
    <li> HSI is a trusted product and as a user of several of their hair care products, I have come to love every product I&#x27;ve tried. I can&#x27;t live without argan oil. It has saved my hair. It is what keeps this frizzy hair tamed. Love HSI!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. A little goes a long way and leaves hair feeling smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> This product works fantastic for me. I am going to buy again.</li>
    <li> extraordinary penetration; after a long winter, my skin was not only dry, but had cracks.  In three days, the dryness was thoroughly eliminated -- and to my grateful surprise, the cracks began to heal.  Altogether - satisfaction is an understatement.</li>
    <li> Great product for hair! I get it frequently.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have hair that breaks very easy and I have to use oils to help my hair. I&#x27;ve found that this product works great and you get a good amount of product when you purchase it.</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully on curly hair.  It smooths out any coarseness and makes styling that much easier</li>
    <li> This is an amazing hair product. I loved how it makes my hair so smooth, shiny and looks healthy. Smells really good!!!👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> My wife purchased the HSI professional flat iron and it came with a sample of this product.  She loved the look of her hair so much after starting to use the trial product that she ordered the larger bottle.  It has made a significant difference in protecting her hair and helping it maintain a shine when using the hot flat iron.  Absolutely essential product if you are using a flat iron!</li>
    <li> although i had packaging problem at first, the company dealt with the issue when i contact. Now I&#x27;m happy with my organ oil, i&#x27;m dying my hair regularly and this oil helps my hair to shine and takes frizzles. Also it is non-greasy and smells nice. I&#x27;m generally using it before straightening my hair, and it helps for protecting your hair from heat. I think it is really a good product worth trying.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My hair is extremely coarse and very hard to straighten. With this it was very easy to straighten it and it made it really soft. Would definately buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! i don&#x27;t want to use a lot so I don&#x27;t run out of it ! No seriously I go to the hair salon every 6. Weeks and no matter what product they use at the end of 6 weeks my hair looks dead, flat and burnt but with this oil it looks shiny, soft and pretty.. I will keep buying it :-)</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and felt my hair was drying out after years of coloring.  A friend recommended I try Argan Oil.  I did a little research and HSI Argan Oil received great reviews...and they were not wrong!!  I use it every morning before I style and I love the results.  You don&#x27;t need much to get the results.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Leaves hair soft and shiny. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have fine hair that I highlight and flat iton my hair, so my hair gets very dried out. From the 1st time I used tge oil my hair felt so much softer. Even my mom noticed and that really says a lot.  I will definitely be buying again. It was also shipped and received quickly.</li>
    <li> I use this product after every shower to protect my hair from heat, maintain frizz, and add gentle shine. It works amazingly by moisturizing and protecting the hair without weighing it down or making it greasy. PERFECT!</li>
    <li> The product is good; however, I received mine almost empty, since it leaked through all the box.</li>
    <li> This product actually helps a lot. My hair gets really frizzy after each time of using hair dryer, but this helps smoothing my hair.The most important point is that I don&#x27;t feel any damage to my hair after brushing. and also it has a great smell.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday to make my curly, frizzy and dry hair manageable. It smells great, smooths my hair and helps define my curls. It&#x27;s the only oil I&#x27;ve found so far that Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy which is awesome!! If you have dry hair this will help.</li>
    <li> I got this oil along with the HSI straightener and I love what it does for my hair.  I have fine hair and it really makes my hair shiny and smooth when using it with the straightener.  I&#x27;ve used it both in wet hair and also after drying it before I straighten it and it works well both ways.</li>
    <li> I ordered the HSI argan oil with pump, a small bottle, and I love it. One pump of oil is enough for my long hair.  I&#x27;ve had the bottle for several months, use daily, and looks like I have several more months before I&#x27;ll run out. The fragrance is light and just a bit &amp;#34;mysterious&amp;#34;, another reason I love the oil. Another plus, I swear my hair dries twice as fast after I use this. Of course, the main reason I ordered argan oil in the first place was for the shine and the possible protection it provides, I think it delivers nicely. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE, I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not bad!  This review is for the Argan Oil leave in conditioner.  I could add it to my hair daily and not feel any major build-up.  I would say my hair is naturally slightly on the dry side, which is why this stuff helps with adding shine / controlling frizz.  My hair is also borderline long and a little will do the trick -  I just put my palm on the open end, flip it over and back upright, and whatever is on my palm I add to my hair roots and then all over.  I do plan on getting it once I run out, again.  I can&#x27;t say this stuff makes my hair extra soft, but that was not what I was looking for in the product.</li>
