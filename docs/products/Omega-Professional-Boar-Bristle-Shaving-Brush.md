      <li>So far I am happy with it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t see paying more for a shaving brush when Omega brushes like this are available.</li>

      <li>I use a home made shave soap that has an excellent and stable lather typically.  </li>
      <li>It handles creams just fine if you are wondering.</li>
      <li>Even if they don&#x27;t get softer, I&#x27;d be perfectly fine with them.</li>
      <li>/&gt; one seems to work fine, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as my cheap badger hair brush.</li>
      <li>But then when I tried the smaller [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] I bought for travelling it worked perfectly every time.</li>
      <li>, This is a hefty, good-size resin handle that doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like the handle is cheap plastic either</li>
      <li>While the bristles themselves feel great, they are constantly falling off while I&#x27;m using the product and getting stuck to my face.</li>
      <li>I find Prorasso Green (menthol) works the best.</li>

      <li>I was hoping it would get better with use, but after 4 uses it is still pretty</li>
      <li>I am primarily using this with Taylor of Old Bond Street and am whipping up a nice lather in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>don&#x27;t lose sleep over it, but I rarely use it because I have a better higher end badger brush.</li>

    <li> This is not my first brush, but it is my first boar brush.  Takes a couple dozen uses to be fully broken in.  I prefer this brush over my badgers for face lathering.  It is a very large brush...if you have smaller hands, get a smaller boar brush.  Can&#x27;t beat the performance for the price.</li>
    <li> Lot of personal opinion when it comes to brushes.&lt;br /&gt;This&lt;br /&gt; one seems to work fine, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as my cheap badger hair brush. Longer and stiffer bristles than my other brush. Plastic handle, but sturdy and feels nice.</li>
    <li> Not a bad little brush for the price. Pre-treat it by soaking in some water with a little bit of dish soap, then rinsing and letting it dry. Then lather up with a nice tallow based soap and let it sit overnight. Wash off the dried soap in the morning and shave away! After a month of use it&#x27;s very soft. Hair loss has been minimal but I do notice one or two coming off every 3rd shave or so. There were a lot of lost hairs in the beginning.</li>
    <li> Good Brush so far, I only use it a couple of times, It a big brush.It didnt smell bad as a lot of people said.I only saw a few hair that came out.I soak it over night, and then put shaving soap in it,and let it sit over night.I use it the next Day,after the third shave, it was more softer.It latter up well with the proraso soap.They say after about ten shave it get softer .It wasnt hard on my face.I will update more Detail later. thank amazon.</li>
    <li> Great brush.I  switch on and off with another Omega boar bristle.No foul oder or lost hair.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t quit broke in yet but it does a great job on my harder soaps. For the price and for a beginner it is a great purchase. Just understand that it is huge!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a couple of years, this is my first boar, and it&#x27;s terrific. This thing feels fine in the hand, looks good (it&#x27;s a big brush) and it lathers like a champ! My other brushes are much more expensive badgers, but this baby seems just as good as any of them. Boar brushes sometimes come with a \\&quot;wet dog\\&quot; sort of smell, but I just gave it a soak, lathered it up with some Proraso menthol-eucalyptus soap, and let it sit overnight - no more odor. My first shaves with it were a real pleasure, and it&#x27;s not even broken in yet. It&#x27;s great for hard soaps or creams, and you should see what it does when you whip up a superlather.  I paid TEN BUCKS and it arrived right on time. It&#x27;s a no-brainer - if you wet shave, my guess is you&#x27;ll like this brush very much.</li>
    <li> This brush already had split ends, which is a great thing. The smell was pungent, but faded after I treated it with detergent. I&#x27;ve used this for a few months, and have only found that it gets softer and holds more water with greater use.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a very costly brush and for the price I&#x27;m not going to complain about it because it does function as advertised, is manufactured well, and will get the job done.  With that said, for an additional $10 or so you can get a much nicer to use badger hair Chinese brush from the big auction site.  I ordered this and the Vie-Long 12705 at the same time and both will be used as a travel or backup brush only.  I also found the bristles to be firmer than badger which was expected but also much longer than on my other brush which made getting a good lather a slightly longer process.  I use a home made shave soap that has an excellent and stable lather typically.  I would certainly spend a few extra dollars for the Vie-Long if it were my only brush although I would give it the same number of stars.</li>
    <li> Very Good Quality would love another one.</li>
    <li> The 10049 is a big boar bristle brush. Don&#x27;t let that scare you, even if you have had stiff prickly boar brushes in the past ( I have ). This brush is pretty soft right out of the box and will get softer with use and man o man does it whip up lather! I use Proraso green and this brush is the perfect match to get a rich lather.</li>
    <li> I liked the first one so much, I ordered a spare for when I travel.</li>
    <li> Great product, and I have ordered a second one.  A great buy.</li>
    <li> This brush lives up to its high ratings.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t mind a slightly smaller handle, I think.(I was looking for a 20102 but I couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;The brush barely had an odor: if you stuck your nose in it when wet, it had a scent, but it was not an issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;Great starter, if not permanent, brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush at any price.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that this is my first shaving brush. I&#x27;ve been shaving for 20 years now, and only just now decided to switch to a cream and brush. I followed the same method for breaking in my brush that Justin Clark wrote in his review (sort by Most Helpful, and his is at the top), and after TWO uses, can no longer smell any part of the boar. To be fair, mine didn&#x27;t smell that bad right out of the box, but the method used to neutralize the odors makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the bristles weren&#x27;t too rough at all. Even if they don&#x27;t get softer, I&#x27;d be perfectly fine with them. The entire reason that I bought this brush was because I wasn&#x27;t having much luck getting a good lather on my Taylor of Old Bond Street cream using just my hands. This brush solved that problem for under $10, because it whips up a hell of a lather, comparatively speaking. It&#x27;s not the same as big brand foams, but the first thing you learn is that more is not always better.</li>
    <li> Really like this brush so far...actually I like it quite a bit better than the badger brush I purchased initially (which was surprisingly picky).  I had some hesitation about this brush as many reviews talk about boar brushes being &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34;...well, all I can say is that this one wasn&#x27;t at all.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for - and this is a perfect example.  Horrible smell in the beginning (natural hair - yuck) that fades over time.  Bristles are a bid rough.  But no bristles are falling out, does a great job of lathering.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this shaving brush off-site, and was amazed at the sheer size and quality when i received it.&lt;br /&gt;First of all it comes with that very well known animal scent, because this in deed is a high quality boar bristle shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;The break in period has been reduced almost to nothing after following a few tutorials on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush for any newcomer to wet shaving, or anyone that just wants to trade up on their brush.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I searched a long time for a good brush and recently returned a badger hair brush before I found this one. I love the fact that the bristles are stiff enough to hold their shape while I&#x27;m working up a good lather in the mug and then on my face. The badger hair brush flattened out like a pancake and was worthless. This one makes a great lather but is still plenty soft enough for me. I&#x27;ve been brush shaving for 40 years and this is the nicest brush I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> This brush is a big brush...Really BIG. That being said, it is a great bowl lathering brush... very soft but kinda floppy. Made with quality components, nice soft tips. It is in my brush rotation, so I use it regularly and it was really cheap. Great product, great price. VERY BIG!</li>
    <li> First of all, I wouldn&#x27;t put much stock in the three star reviews above. The gentleman who said that he could get a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; badger brush for the same price, frankly, doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about. For one, there is almost no such thing as a Nice badger brush for under $50.00. There are exceptions, but they are few and far between. Second, this is a BOAR bristled shaving brush. It performs completely different than badger brushes. That&#x27;s why I bought it. This brush is made by perhaps the most renown manufacturer of boar brushes in the world. It is an excellent shaving tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owning several high-end badger brushes myself, made by the likes of Simpson, Kent, WSP and Vulfix, I feel comfortable saying that I know a little something about traditional wet shaving, and a lot about shaving brushes. When you buy a badger brush of any grade, what you open out of the box is what you get. People who that there is a break-in period for badger brushes might be right, but I&#x27;ve never really noticed a difference after any amount of time. That&#x27;s the fun of a boar brush. They break-in and take on different properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A boar brush comes to you stiff and stinky.  It doesn&#x27;t hold very much water and smells awful when wet. This brush fits that description. At the end of this post I will give instructions to remove this stench overnight. You will find that the bristles start to change in the middle of your first shave. As they soak up water, they become more flexible and easier to paint your face with.&lt;br /&gt;Proper brush maintenance is essential to keep your brush in good condition. Buy a cheep brush stand and keep this brush hung upside-down to dry between shaves. As the brush dries, the bristles begin to split. This happens after the very first use and will continue to for months. Mine is fully broken in after three weeks and it is just as soft as some of my Silvertips and holds almost as much water. I wish that I could post a picture and show the difference between new and one month old. It also smells like the last soap that I whipped up with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking both the quality and price of the brush into consideration, this brush gets a 100/100 score from me. I have no complaints. Sure, I&#x27;d love it to have a nice wooden or ivory handle, but at $10, I certainly won&#x27;t complain. It&#x27;s not like the handle is cheap plastic either, This is a hefty, good-size resin handle that doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. I honestly feel like this gem might be the best deal on the market in the shaving brush world. I have a Semogue Owners Club that cost four times as much and performs EXACTLY the same. Usually you get what you pay for; sometime you get more. This is one of those occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To break in your brush and get the smell out, you&#x27;ll need a glass, dish soap and some strong smelling shaving soap. I find Prorasso Green (menthol) works the best. First fill a glass with three fingers of warm water and a liberal amount of dish soap. Gently give the brush a few swirls in the soapy water to mix it up and let it sit for about twenty minutes. After twenty minutes rinse the brush with warm water and load a fair amount of Prorasso onto the tips of the brush. Without getting carried away, the more the better. Palm lather the soap until you get stiff peaks and cover the top quarter of the brush with your lather. Put the brush on the counter, tips up, and leave overnight. The next morning, rinse off the dry lather and shave. The brush will no longer stink and the tips will have already begun to split. ENJOY!ence between new and one month old.

    <li> I had read great reviews that this brush is a good deal for it&#x27;s cost. I bought it expecting something of good quality. While the bristles themselves feel great, they are constantly falling off while I&#x27;m using the product and getting stuck to my face. Good materials, poor construction. Would not recommend. It gets two stars because it does lather well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy being covered in boar bristles, this is the brush for you!</li>
    <li> Happy with the product. Its soft and does not hurts with its hair if rubbed on the face. Thank you</li>
    <li> I thought I just wasn&#x27;t using it right because it was really hard to get the right consistency to the lather; it was either too wet or too chalky. But then when I tried the smaller [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] I bought for travelling it worked perfectly every time. I ended up buying a second Escali brush and use that all the time now, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are stiff and straw-like, it&#x27;s a larger brush than most holders I&#x27;ve tried and it wouldn&#x27;t lather.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for 10 days, but after prepping it has become my favorite. Even over my badger hair brush. It is a big brush so it holds plenty of lather. The bristles have softened and yet they are still stiff enough to really work the lather into my whiskers. It has lost a few hairs, but that is to be expected with any brush. I feel it is a great buy for the money! PRODUCT UPDATE: I have now used this brush for over two years. It has broken in very nicely. It has lost a few more bristles, but not enough to worry about. Anyone who wants a basic shaving brush that works well with both soaps and creams should buy this. You won&#x27;t find a better brush for the money!</li>
    <li> Works well, has to go through the standard seasoning process to break in. So far no shedding after the first week. Will post updates later on. Will not expect a boar bristle to be as soft as a badger brush, so may take some time to break in</li>
    <li> Mine has yet to break in, which I&#x27;ve been assured will eventually happen.  As it is, the brush lost about 6-8 hairs in the first use and seems to shed about 1 or 2 with each additional use.  Not a great brush, but a good value.</li>
    <li> My first boar brush, and it&#x27;s hard to find fault with it. Holds lather well, soft with plenty of backbone, comfortable heft, easy to use. Oh, and it&#x27;s amazingly inexpensive - and I&#x27;d be surprised if you&#x27;d find much problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, one little problem. If you hold the brush underwater, water may slip into the handle area. It doesn&#x27;t interfere with the shaving, but you might hear a small splashing in the hollow part of the brush.</li>
    <li> Classic! Great brush, can&#x27;t beat the price.  Once it&#x27;s broken in it feels great and can make a ton of lather.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by others saying a boar brush is scratchy - im many instances I prefer this to a badger. It has good backbone and it much softer than I expected. This brush does a great job with soaps, and may do better with creams once my technique improves. When using it with Dreadnought shave cream the volume of lather is enormous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hold as much water as a badger but that is one reason some want a boar. Depending on what you are using for the lather, the technique does change a bit so experimentation is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did arrive with a nasty odor that took several weeks to diminish, but nothing that was a deal breaker. For the $$$ I cannot see how this can be beat.</li>
    <li> The Omega Shaving Brush, is excellent.  The price was also excellent.  Could not have gotten a greater brush for the money.  I give it 4 stars.  And will recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This brush never really impressed me. It does not hold water great and not great for face lathering.&lt;br /&gt;More of a paint on type brush.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t lose sleep over it, but I rarely use it because I have a better higher end badger brush.</li>
    <li> Once it gets broken in, it gets softer. This is perfect for soaps, but works equally well with creams.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter brush. Omegas are well-constructed, quality boar brushes. For appx. $10 it&#x27;s difficult not to recommend it. I&#x27;ve spent two months using it and have had mostly positive results with it. It does arrive fairly soft, but definitely will require some break-in. Mine took about two weeks of consistent use for the hairs to really start splitting. I also soaked it in hot water for about half an hour, ran a conditioner and baby shampoo through it, and let it dry for two days to help it along. The funk was pretty severe and it still lingers when the brush is freshly soaked. If you have a strong sense of smell you will want to condition it when it arrives.&lt;br /&gt;  As for shedding, I&#x27;ve lost about thirteen hairs (as of today). I don&#x27;t know if I should be worried yet. These are built with a little bowl around the knot to keep you from soaking the binding glue, so that&#x27;s also helpful for new users. The handle is a little too long for my hand (about medium sized hands) and the loft is too large for my liking, as it tends to devour all of my lather and makes me use more product. I would recommend using soap and a bowl with this considering the size and bristle type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Edit: It finally stopped shedding. Now that it is really broken in it&#x27;s my go-to brush if I need a lot of lather. Still stinks a little bit.</li>
    <li> Good size brush, Lathers well and is the right price.</li>
    <li> I saw great reviews for this brush and decided I would replace the cheap badger I had that came in the a set.  I usually soak my brush in the mug in hot water while I shower.  Dump out the water, add a dollop of proraso shave soap and lather up.  The cheap badger I have does a good enough job and makes enough lather for three passes or more.  This omega boar brush seems to just take the soap but not really lather at all.  I was hoping it would get better with use, but after 4 uses it is still pretty poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a large brush and the stiffer bristles are nice, but disappointed in the lathering ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve tried to use this brush for a week.  I read on a forum to soak in in water with conditioner for a couple days.  Still can not get lather up.  Will get a decent lather going in the mug and it all just disappears when applied to my face.  Going back to my cheap badger I guess.</li>
    <li> sheds a bit but works good enough for my shaving applications</li>
    <li> The Omega Professional is the gold standard in Boar brushes. You won&#x27;t ever spend money on a badger after you use this. Soak it while you shower in some warm water and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m gonna rate this 5 stars for now. It&#x27;s my first venture into the DE world of shaving. I used Gillette cartridge razors as a boy growing up and switched to electric around 20 years old. Now I&#x27;m moving onto DE wet shaving. Picked up all my supplies from Amazon and this is the brush I settled on. So far I am happy with it. It&#x27;s firm but it doesn&#x27;t overdue it. I was able to get a real nice lather with it so for a first timers brush I love this. I have nothing to compare it to at this time so I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s 5 star worthy.</li>
    <li> This brush is a great value for the price. The bristles are very firm and well anchored in the handle. It raises a nice lather with every shaving soap I&#x27;ve tried. The handle is plastic, but it is well constructed, nicely finished and with a nice heft. I can&#x27;t see paying more for a shaving brush when Omega brushes like this are available.</li>
    <li> Compared to the price of a quality badger, this brush is a steal. Being boar it starts out a bit stiff, scratchy and stinky, but after a couple weeks usage it softens right up and the animal smell goes away.</li>
    <li> It is my new favorite brush. I have only been wet shaving for 4 years but, this brush is what I would recommend to anyone starting out. I started with the cheep Van Der Hagen and that was such a bad boar brush it took me 3 plus years to try another and now I am excited to try more. I have found that the omega does better with soaps than creams. I have been used 25ish times and it keeps getting better. It is as soft, if not softer, than my pure badger brush. The only negative is that the handle is huge. I did not think I have small hands but this is by far the largest handled brush I own.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no getting around it, this brush is HUGE!  It&#x27;s a little too big, but for the quality at the price point, it&#x27;s such a great deal. Despite its size, this brush never disappoints. It breaks in quickly, retains it&#x27;s moisture and is always easy to load.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush handmade in Italy, and for the PRICE, an excellent value.  I had some initial problems using this brush.  There was an odor coming from the bristles the first time I lathered up to shave.  Going through the different shaving forums I discovered that this sometimes happens with new brushes - it is NOT the sellers fault.  I soaked mine in a little dish washing detergent for 2-3 hours first and all the strange odors were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a really happy camper - a good quality brush, not overly expensive and it makes a GREAT hot lather.  Beats using canned shaving cream any day of the week!</li>
    <li> Durable and effective at any price point.  After a break in period, it does a great job and I like the stiffness.</li>
    <li> This brush is a really great starting brush for those looking to get into wet shaving. I like it far more than the comparably priced badger brushes available. The backbone is great and the bristles are getting softer with every shave.</li>
    <li> Everything is as what was expected. The only one surprise for me was that I had no holder for that brush. This brush is bigger than my previous.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was some smell at first but that went away quickly. After about a month this brush was building lather consistently. The tips of the bristles split, just as they do on a badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to start soaking this brush in hot water before I get in the shower. The extra-long soak time helps soften the bristles and maximizes the amount of water in the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enormous knot of this brush holds as much lather as you&#x27;d ever need. The enormous knot is also somewhat of a weakness as it is larger than necessary and a little floppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brush shed only a small number of bristles at first. The quality of the knot seems excellent and is a huge step up from a no-name boar brush. The handle seems quite durable yet it isn&#x27;t heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall you are getting a well-made Italian boar brush for short money. The value is excellent.</li>
    <li> great for cleaning guns.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with a badger for a little while now, but really wanted to try a boar.  I was told they are stiffer, and take awhile to break in. This is true, but it was not uncomfortable at all during the break-in period. Also, I get much faster/thicker lather off of soaps from this brush. For this reason this is my go-to soap brush and my badger is my go-to cream brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, this brush kills any badger in the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had any complaints it would be the initial boar hair smell.  It took a little longer than my badger to go away (About a week)</li>
    <li> Perhaps you are looking into getting into wetshaving. Perhaps straight edge or safety razor and you find your self looking for a solid brush to start out. This omega boar is a great place to start. Does that mean it&#x27;s mediocre or average quality? Not at all. This omega 49 was recommended to me as THE boar brush to consider. Time and again multiple sources pointed to this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boar has stiffer bristles than badger. Don&#x27;t picture guitar wire here. It still applies softly to the face. The stiffer hair makes a good lather on harder soaps. Perhaps you are looking at pucks of Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat or something similar. You may want to consider this brush. It handles creams just fine if you are wondering. I am primarily using this with Taylor of Old Bond Street and am whipping up a nice lather in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the omega brand is a respected and trusted brand in the wetshaving community and I see why. I can easily recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great for bowl lathering.  I prefer a badger for face lathering.  Can&#x27;t be the value.</li>
    <li> This excellent genuine boar bristle brush is great element for getting a close shave.  I realize that for this price I&#x27;m not going to get sterling silver, so I accept the slightly plastic build, but the bristles are the real thing and I expect it will hold up to use over many years.</li>
    <li> Great brush, though the handle is really fat and has trouble staying in my brush holder</li>
    <li> Great brush. Very soft with good backbone once broken in. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> The brush handle was much thicker than the photo and product description suggests, which didn&#x27;t allow it to hang properly on my shaving stand.  I&#x27;ve fit several other brushes on my stand with no issue and have gifted the same stand to a friend, who also has not had issues with any of his brushes fitting.  It&#x27;s a pretty standard sized stand, so it&#x27;s frustrating that this brush has such a huge handle that it won&#x27;t fit into the stand.  Storage is a pain, but I otherwise like the brush.</li>
    <li> So far, this shaving brush has been true to all it&#x27;s positive reviews.  No bristles have fallen out, which has happened with all previous shave brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to find a downside to this one. I&#x27;ve been a badger brush user all along, but on a wild hair (see what I did there) decided to try a boar. Everyone who uses them raves about how soft they are, but seem to apologetically add asides about their feral animal stench and breaking-in period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t note any kind of off-odor to this brush at all. I didn&#x27;t have to soak it in hot water for 15 minutes to get it soft enough to use. I didn&#x27;t have to prewash it in anything weird. I washed it once with baby shampoo when it arrived and put it to work the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is much lighter than you&#x27;d expect, and the fairly cool looking label shreds in water, but other than that this brush is perfect. It doesn&#x27;t shed, and honestly it whips up a nicer lather than my expensive badger. If I&#x27;d have gotten this brush first, I&#x27;d probably just have gotten another one rather than shelling out for a Simpson.</li>
