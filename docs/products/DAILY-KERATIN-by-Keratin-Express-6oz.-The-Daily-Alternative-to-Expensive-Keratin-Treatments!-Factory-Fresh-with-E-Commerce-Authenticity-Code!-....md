<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this entire collection of products.  The smoothing treatment makes a noticeable difference in my often frizzy hair! Just a little goes a loooong way!  I use it every other day and it lasts for months! Worthwhile investment:)</li>
    <li> This is a great product for anyone with long, thick hair.I have long, thick, frieze hair.I put it on and the frizz goes away.It is like magic.This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;m on my third tube. It keeps my hair nice and manageable, even during our humid east coast summers. Now if I could only keep my daughter from using it when she comes home... Guess I&#x27;ll have to buy her a tube for herself!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after a beautician raved about it. I wasn&#x27;t impressed - my hair does better on other products.</li>
    <li> I ordered it because it came highly recommended. I love the product. It is worth every penny. I use it everday. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for my fine, frizzy hair, and when I used smoothing and/ or conditioning products, all I ever ended up with was a heavy, greasy, flat look. Then I found Daily Keratin and my hair is sleek but not limp, its manageable, shiny and vibrant looking, has a little bit of volume and bounce, as well. Best of all, it will last until the next shampoo. I would recommend this product , its well worth the price. I have also been able to stop using the flat-iron (I just use a large round brush to acheive a smooth look) and my hair has stopped breaking since I no longer need heat tools. I wont ever be without this product again.</li>
    <li> Greasy.  Smells weird. Did not perform as other keratin products have.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great hair product,</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair soft and shiny, almost like having a true Keratin Treatment at the salon.  I use it whenever the weather is going to be ultra-humid which is quite often since I live in Florida.  I am running low so will need to re-order this.</li>
    <li> I have greying hair, and I both color and highlight it. I have always had a lot of hair, but it is baby-fine, with lots of frizz and it is hard to style. This product is the best I have ever used on my hair. For those who are confused, as I was, with the product&#x27;s directions....I wash my hair and then towel dry WITHOUT using any post-shampoo conditioner or detangler. When I am out of the shower, I rub a nickel to quarter sized \\&quot;drop\\&quot; (I have shoulder-length hair) onto the palms of my hands and then work through my hair. I wait a few minutes,and then blow dry. The result is no friz, healthy looking hair. If I used a hot iron, the color on my hair absolutely shines! I have never had these kinds of results with my hair before using this product. Definitely a 5 star product for me.</li>
    <li> The product is think and heavy like cold Crisco.  It  is heavy on your hair and makes it look greasy and dirty.  I am not sure what the best use is, maybe lubricating machinery.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I live in Florida, and the humidity with my hair which&lt;br /&gt;is fine and curly turned into a ball of frizz, not very attractive to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;I Love this KERATIN EXPRESS DAILY TREATMENT since I have been using it my hair is still&lt;br /&gt;curly but I have ZERO frizz, and as you only need to use about a dime size amount this bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since I started using it and it&#x27;s only been about 2-3 weeks.  It really does give you beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after I noticed my hair was extremely damaged. It was about $10 more retail than what I paid on here. You only need a small amount and it goes a long way. Does not leave hair oily. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Was provided a sample and just loved how manageable my hair was when used after a shampoo.  It find it for such a reasonable price was just amazing.</li>
    <li> Smells like a paint and the consistency is very thick and rubbery, not the same with the one I tried on from the hair salon I went to.</li>
    <li> This product  did not work for me. I have found something that works better and won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> this is another product i purchased and i was very satisfied. product quick. i had questions and they were answered very fast thanks</li>
    <li> great product. Leaves hair nice and shinny.make sure to apply it evenly and brush your hair before styling your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this so much better than smoothing oils. It works great for my frizzy hair to make it smooth and keep it in control. Also adds shine.</li>
    <li> After a salon straightening treatment went terribly wrong, they gave me this to help condition my hair. It works for over processed, brittle, breaking hair. Use it everyday as a leave in conditioner. My hair is shoulder length and I use a dime size amount. Then style.</li>
    <li> Works perfect on my curly hair. Dont use too much though! Only pea size is necessary! My hair is siljy smooth...i have very fine, curly hair and love this proroduct.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser always uses this on me and she tried to get me to purchase this through her for $55! So glad I checked on here. I love this stuff, it makes my hair feel so soft and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few Keratin treatments and this is my favorite. It is not too goo-ey nor too thin. I really notice a difference versus other products - not so fly away and styles better.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this product - and I was very happy to find out that I could get it via Amazon - for a little less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, frizzy hair and do get it straightened once a year - but this product keeps it smooth all throughout the year.  It&#x27;s particularly nice if your hair tends to frizz up in damp climates. This keeps it well-controlled, and you only need a small amount - so it last a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also shared it with a friend of mine who does have course, wavy hair, and it keeps her hair beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase and my 2nd time to buy online because it is much cheaper than purchasing at the salon.  I like using this product because it makes me feel like I&amp;#34;m protecting my hair when I use it daily before styling.</li>
    <li> Horrible!  My hair is now breaking off!</li>
    <li> I use this product after styling as it keeps my hair in place and gives it body and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair everyday.</li>
    <li> Love this product, use it every day</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have coarse, wavy hair that tends to look a little frizzy.  This is a great heat protectant and helps limit the frizzies</li>
    <li> Live this stuff.  Keeps the Frizz at bay!</li>
    <li> Great product. Straightens and smooths with small amount.</li>
    <li> My hair is now super soft and great for flat ironing!</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well this worked for me. Would have rated it higher, but the build up from the product happens pretty fast. Other than that, it&#x27;s great tamed my wild kinky hair.</li>
    <li> This product has been good for my hair.  Helps stop breakage and keeps it very straight.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Even using a small amount if this in my hair still made it feel like I had glue in my hair. It even has the texture of white Elmer&#x27;s glue. There are MANY other superior products at or even less than this price range bi wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> have had a full keratin treatment in the past and was pleased with results..I am finding Daily Keratin is doing the job just fine without the expense or time contraints.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all.  It leaves my hair with oily look.  I have to rewash  twice to try to get the oil out but you really have to work the shampoo pretty hard to get the oil out.  No matter how much I rinse, it still leaves my hair feeling and looking oily.  I went online to look to see if I&#x27;m using it wrong.  I finally stopped using this product and don&#x27;t recommend it.  I feel ripped off.  I paid way too much for a dud product.</li>
    <li> I have curly frizzy hair, this product helps me get the frizz-free look. It has got a nice chocolately smell. I apply this product on damp hair and let it air dry. Some days after air-drying I  flat iron my hair...its gives me shiny and soft hair.  I&#x27;ve given only four stars because I don&#x27;t know it this product withstands humidity....will try it during the summer days and update then further..</li>
    <li> Have used this product for nearly 2 years. It has always tamed the mane in the hot humidity of Florida. Would highly recommend to any one with naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  Really helps damaged hair and protects against heat tools.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Am repeat customer</li>
    <li> This product was not the Keratin Express I thought it would be.  The KE my stylist has used in the past had a deep chocolate smell unlike this product.  The product I received also seemed to dry my hair out rather than condition it so I was not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Makes your hair shine, smoothes down all the flyaway hair, smells wonderful &amp; conditions any damaged ends. Hair seems to dry faster when you blow dry, creates added volume with a beautiful shine.</li>
    <li> This product gives me that straight from the salon healthy looking shine and softness.  Love it!  The only thing I hated was that it partially opened in shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> smooth, sleek hair just as promised!  Love the results on my curly hair and I can just use the blow dryer and round brush, no flat iron needed.</li>
    <li> The best smoother I have used for my hair.  I have fine, thin hair that frizzes easy but this treatment helps stop the frizz and makes my hair look great.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for months and it leaves your hair shiny and soft. Having very curly hair works great when leaving it in just for curly day...or you can blow dry straight and it stays for days nice and soft. Great product.</li>
    <li> I received my product quickly and at a very good price!  I&#x27;ve used the product before, so I knew it was good quality.  The next time I run out, I know where to order from.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It keeps my hair smooth and straight through each shampoo. I have very curly and frizzy hair, and it has looked fabulous in the humidity. I only use it after I have washed my hair and towel dried it. I put a dime size amount in and blow it dry, and don even need to use a flat iron.  Too bad this wasn&#x27;t invented in high school years.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and weather can make it friz quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This product not only controls the friz but my hair feels thicker and is healthier.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair that frizzes up in seconds if it&#x27;s humid outside. I have tried so many different products trying to combat my frizz. Most recently I have been using Coppola Infusion before blow drying and straitening. It did a fairly good job but would still frizz up when the humidity was high. I decided to try Keratin Express Daily Keratin for a change and are blown away by the results! I live in Georgia where the humidity can become unbearable at times. During the time I first used it, it was raining for three days straight with at least 80 - 95% humidity. My hair barely frizzed up at all. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I think this product is wonderful. I definitely recommend trying it out. Well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that I could use to get rid of my frizzles. My expensive salon \\&quot;Keratin Express\\&quot; treatment did not work. I read the reviews on this, and decided to try it. This is perfect! Just what I was looking for. I use it with each shampoo and my frizzles are gone! A lot cheaper than my useless salon treatment.  Go for it!</li>
    <li> at the hair salon, the product seemed awesome and a must have.  With daily use, I haven&#x27;t seen an increase in the shine but hair does feel healthy.  Nice smell!</li>
    <li> This produc it better that any other I use. I pay hundred dollars for keratin treatment and I never felt my hair this way, no dryness, no grease, it just perfect. I will recommend to every one</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair that absorbs moisture like a sponge.  I like this product as it smells great and keeps my hair nice and smooth.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I live in Florida, so humidity plays a role in whether or not ai have a bad hair day.  I use this to keep my waves under control.  It works for me.  A little goes a long way.  My age; 64  my texture of hair; colored, dry, wavy, not smooth and silky, and not fine.  Hope this helps</li>
    <li> My hairdresser always mixes it in with the mousse and I can&#x27;t buy it around me anyplace.  A small daub goes a long want and with my frizzes and the heat in TX, this calms it all.</li>
    <li> I like how soft and straight this makes my hair. It does&#x27;t substitute for a real keratin treatment but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It made my hair feel so much healthier than anything else I have ever used. After my first application my hair was sleek and my frizzies were gone. My hair looked healthy and had the bounce of youth.  I noticed my hair felt thicker, healthier and more manageable than I have ever noticed before. My growing-in gray&#x27;s were no longer standing-up like coarse springs. My hair had the feel of health. I also noticed my hair was unaffected by humidity. It is expensive to purchase in salons, costing as much as $15 more than Amazon.  I have very long hair and found I need double the amount recommended on the bottle. Even though I use twice as much, this product lasts.  My first bottle last more than 7 months. I would not want to be without this product.  This is a great product. It is so good you can either eliminate or reduce the amount of conditioner you use in the shower. The product is great, the excellent results are real and Amazon offers it for the best price I have found.unt of conditioner you use in the shower.

    <li> I have thick, bushy, frizzy hair and have battled all my life to try to smooth it down.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that actually works.  I have salon keratin treatments and this product allows me to go much, much longer between treatments (and may even eliminate the need for them, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine that yet).  It is a cream, and absorbs into your hair quickly and lightly. They suggest a dime-size amount, but if you have really long, very thick hair like me you might need 3 times that amount.  But it is well worth it. I&#x27;ve never been happier with my hair and I&#x27;ve tried everything.  I would give this product 10 stars if I could. (Keratin Complex, a competing brand, doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  You can read my review there, where I gave it 1 star.)</li>
    <li> The box I received was damaged and taped up and was NOT what was pictured.  I was disappointed! I see by the reviews that this also happened to someone else around the same timeframe as my order.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product in a salon.  I have curly hair which frizzes up in any humidity.  Just a very small amount really makes a difference in keep my hair straighter.  (Just be careful not to use too much at once, as it will make your hair have a greasier feeling.)&lt;br /&gt;Since a small amount is effective, the tube lasts a long time.  I have very difficult hair, and this is one of the few hair products that actually is effective in cutting down on the friz.  In addition to being a good product, I was very happy to see that the online cost is a lot less than I paid in the salon.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my granddaughter who has thick and curly hair.  She notices the difference and enjoys using it.</li>
    <li> The smoothing treatments works well on my moderately curley hair so that I can straighten it with a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent here compared to the salon!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you want straight and smooth hair, this is the product for you. Even during a rainy day this product works great no need for special sulfate free shampoos with this product, but it does works great with the Loreal sulfate free shampoo and conditioner but not necessary. I am hooked this is the product for me and a little goes along way.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for dry damaged hair. Can be used daily. Smells good!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not all that. I&#x27;ve tried better hair products like &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works great on taming long hair. Smells a bit like chocolate.</li>
    <li> This is GREAT! It allowed me to get an extra month out of my keratin treatment and I only used it every third day.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, naturally wavey maybe I should say,not tight curls but wave.  I have tried quite a few straightening serums and this is the best one yet.  I get it flat iron straight just from blow drying.  If you have tighter curls it might still take a flat iron but for me, it has totally eliminated the flat iron.  My hairstylist originally used it on me, so I got a trial run before I actually bought it.  I am very impressed that it only takes about a nickle size amount to do my whole thick head of hair.  I strongly recommend this product.  The smell is pleasant but not overwhelming. This tube of 6 oz I expect will last me longer than 6 months.</li>
