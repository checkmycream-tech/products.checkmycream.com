<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so this is perfect, it doesnt irritate me at all. I have a pale complexion and the sunscreen does not have a noteable smell like some do.</li>
    <li> Great product. I will but it again.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that actually does everything claimed on the bottle. Also, it&#x27;s the only lotion I&#x27;ve ever found that actually doesn&#x27;t clog pores. It provides the perfect amount of moisture without feeling slimy or heavy. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will continue using it for years to come. I would recommend this lotion to everyone, ever.</li>
    <li> love it gentle on the skin</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have very dry, sensitive skin and Allure magazine said it was great. I can&#x27;t say that it won&#x27;t reduce redness because the product never made it to my face. I applied a liberal amount to my forearm to test for irritation (good habit to get in to) and found that the sent, tho pleasant, stuck in my nostrils and gave me a knock-out head ache. It also made my eyes water profusely as if the waft of fragrance was burning my eyes. I had the lotion on for a maximum of 10min.&lt;br /&gt;  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend such a highly fragranced lotion for the face, since it is fragrance that irritates sensitive skin ( and eyes) in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;  I now use extra virgin olive oil as a moisturizer which turns out to be a great alternative to this product.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizing cream for every day.  Plus it really does calm my inflammation and itchy-area prone skin.  Never clogs my pores. Has a light sunblock as well.</li>
    <li> this product is excellent for hyper sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product tonight. I&#x27;m almost 20 years old, and my face can feel \\&quot;parched\\&quot; when I wash it or get out of the shower, soaps drying it out and making it itchy, etc. I have pretty sensitive skin. I put this moisturizer on my face and my skin is immediately soothed without that extra layer of oily-whatever other moisturizers can leave. Non-greasy, light, SPF, smells great, soothing, moisturizing, calming... and the list goes on. This is an amazing moisturizer and I&#x27;m so happy I found it. Thank you so much Aveeno. My skin hasn&#x27;t been this happy in a long time...</li>
    <li> The ultra calming did nothing to calm down my inflammation due to dryness or acne. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to. It feels a little greasy to me, but it does sink in pretty fast for a drugstore brand. The texture is really creamy and nice. I&#x27;m a little confused about why this has fragrance in it? That can break sensitive skin out (try [[ASIN:B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]]). Not sure why this has sun protection either, seeing that SPF 15 does virtually nothing. I don&#x27;t exactly like the idea of a moisturizer having SPF since I want my moisturizer to sink into my skin and the sun protection is going to sit on top of my skin. It just doesn&#x27;t seem logical. Something I&#x27;ve noticed about products with sunscreen-- they wash my skin out and make me look more chalky/white than I actually am. That includes this one. I won&#x27;t repurchase. My favorite moisturizer is still [[ASIN:B00008ZPG9 Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream, 1.7-Fluid Ounce]].</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Aveeno and I love their Positively Radiant moisturizer so I thought I would give this one a try. Within a day I had small patches of rash bumps on my cheek. At first I thought it might just be the dry weather but they continued to get worse. I began to wonder if it was the moisturizer, especially since the fragrance is so strong (I&#x27;m not allergic to fragrance but I&#x27;ve never had a facial moisturizer that was so heavily fragranced, which I found odd). I switched back to the Positively Radiant and the rash cleared up within a day. Odd that their sensitive skin moisturizer is actually ridiculously irritating when the regular moisturizer works so well.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer, I, too, had an allergic reaction with itching, burning skin and swollen (shut!) eyes.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and I have fair skin. So every day, I have to deal with the red splotches on my face...covering them dot by dot with concealer. I started using this product once a day and, EXACTLY as it says on the box, the redness and irritation went away after one week. Now I can reintroduce my once-a-week gently exfoliation without worrying about redness. Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t have to pay much for this little miracle!</li>
    <li> I started using this stuff about six months ago now and I am in love! I have always had red skin no matter what I did to get rid of it and I just kept covering it up with foundation. At first I bought something from Eucerin but it didn&#x27;t do well under makeup. It started to curl up in little balls and make my skin look greasy and way too pale: it was gross! But this stuff soaks in so fast and the magic that&#x27;s in it makes the redness disappear! I never wear makeup anymore and its an amazing product! Do not hesitate if you&#x27;re thinking about buying!</li>
    <li> I have relatively sensitive skin and always feel slight pain whenever I apply moisturizer on my face, yet I experienced no problems with this Aveeno Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer. The moisturizer is very soothing and moisturizes my face throughout the day evenly. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive fair skin that is prone to eczema in the winter &amp; for some reason my cheeks just flush red, I am not sure why but I do know alcohol makes it worse (so I avoid it). This is the reason I tried Aveeno&#x27;s Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer. I wasn&#x27;t expecting \\&quot;miracles\\&quot; but I did expect it to do more than it does. I have been using it along with the coordinating cleanser for around 3 weeks now &amp; really don&#x27;t see any difference in the red flushing of my cheeks, with that said, it&#x27;s still a nice moisturizer but did not do anything for my red blotchy cheeks. All in all it&#x27;s just a good basic daily moisturizer but nothing more.</li>
    <li> Why would a product made for sensitive skin be fragranced? I guess I should have read the box more carefully. It may work well, I&#x27;ll never know because I had to wash it off due to a perfume allergy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year now and couldn&#x27;t say more good things about it. I have sensitive skin and lotion always affects me differently, usually causing acne or breakouts. This has consistently worked as a facial moisturizer with spf and has not caused the breakouts or acne that I had come accustom to with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t skimp on facial lotion. If your looking for a consistently good and reliable product, this is the one.</li>
    <li> I started using the SPF 30 variety and though it took a little while (and maybe other variables played a role) it had gotten to the point where I had almost no facial redness.&lt;br /&gt;Then I ran out and had to get a new bottle. I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and got the SPF 15 instead of SPF 30. HUGE MISTAKE!! I&lt;br /&gt;applied it and immediately felt a burning sensation. That is never a good sign. It took a minute for it to show up, but then the redness came. I am so disappointed and upset over this product. If you are going to buy it, make sure to get the SPF 30, and even then, it may not work for everyone. Good luck.</li>
    <li> always great and reliable brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;i think they do it on purpose so that around 15% of it towards the end is not usable. meaning, one can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle to use.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin which tends to be red and inflamed, especially when I use creams/lotions/moisturizers with an SPF. This Aveeno moisturizer really does calm my skin and removes about 99% of the redness and irritation. Most days I use it after putting on a glycolic acid cream and the two work together beautifully. I live in Arizona and am exposed to the harsh sun everyday. Using Aveeno Calming Daily Moisturizer w/ sunscreen has helped my skin to stay moisturized with no rash, bumpiness, or even slight sunburning when I&#x27;m outside.I have this on auto delivery although the bottle lasts a really long time. I hope Aveeno never stops making this---it&#x27;s amazing and very effective, not to mention affordable. Thanks Amazon and Aveeno for providing such a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely sensitive. I would very much prefer to use a moisturizer with a stronger SPF, but all of them have caused me to break out severely, so I have always worn hats. I saw on a YouTube review that one woman considered this her \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of skin care, so I decided to try it. Wow, this is the ONLY moisturizer that I have every worn on my cheeks and t-zone areas without a bad reaction. I don&#x27;t know why this doesn&#x27;t irritate whereas other lotions have, but it really doesn&#x27;t. I just wish I could have known of this years ago (if it existed then), especially since I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised after looking on line for some time to find something that would be ok for my sensitive skin.  This product has a strong smell that actually makes my skin red and doesn&#x27;t calm anything. too bad!</li>
    <li> This is a good sunscreen for days when you just out and about, not actually lying in the sun.  It&#x27;s a little heavy for a regular moisturizer, but again, as a daily sunscreen for your face it does the job.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin, I have pimple ridden,oily, 26 year olds skin, and I hate it. I put everything on it, acids, peroxide, etc, so my face is always scaley, flakey, dry, chapped and cracked. Plus the blemishes are red and broken skin. This lotion feels like pure silk being rubbed on my face. Even acne moisturizers seem thick and icky in my face, this stuff is silk in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so this product is perfect for me - especially as it was recommended by my dermatologist. They stopped selling it in New Zealand so was so happy to be able to purchase it online!</li>
    <li> I have used Aveenos Positively Radiant moisturizer for quite a while, but after having a period of my skin being a bit senstive I gave this a whirl. I will say it feels great on my skin. It absorbs nicely without feeling greasy. My skin feels soft and this product does not irritate my skin at all. However, I also have noticed daily problems with my contacts getting smudged up for seemingly no reason. NOTHING else has changed. I wash my hands well after applying moisturizer, have gone through several different pairs of contacts. And yes, I thoroughly clean my contacts nightly. And, of course I don&#x27;t put the lotion near my eyes. But I swear it migrates into my eyes anyway and leads to constant smudging all day long. I mentioned my smudgy contacts to my hubby without mentioning the lotion, just complaining about the \\&quot;cloudiness\\&quot; on my contacts. He asked if I was using the Aveeno face lotion and mentioned that whenever he uses it, it causes his eyes to water all day long. So... I really have done multiple things to rule out all other variables and all I can say is that there must be some residue that may easily get into your eyes, just a heads up for the contact wearers in particular.</li>
    <li> I love this !!!  Totally takes the \\&quot;itchies\\&quot; of winter skin away !!!  Bravo Aveeno !!! Smells wonderful, works great !!!  We had to buy one for each member of the family !!!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and was thrilled to find the Aveeno Ultra Calming line, and the SPF 30 daily moisturizer.  Finally, a moisturizer with sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Imagine my disappointment to find that the SPF 30 version was discontinued, and only the SPF 15 remains. Sigh, ok, I&#x27;ll give it a try.  Well, this is a very different product.  It has a ton a fragrance.  And, more importantly, a different sunscreen than the discontinued SPF 30 version.  Its main ingredient is Avobenzone,  a known irritant.  No wonder it makes my skin burn, and makes me break out in a rash.  So, if you&#x27;re looking for something for sensitive skin, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Best price around on this moisturizer with fast free (Prime) shipping.  Have been using this moisturizer for years and it&#x27;s the best, SPF 15 too, not greasy and no scent.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product, did not by it for me but my mother who has sensitive skin, it helped reduce her rosacea, she loved the product. Expensive for the amount but it&#x27;s good for those with skin problems.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT. IT WORKS WONDERS. THE BEST MOISTURIZER OUT THERE IN MY OPINION. SOOTHES MY REDNESS WELL AND GIVES GOOD MOISTURE. ISN&#x27;T GREASY AT ALL WHICH IS GREAT FOR MY OILY SKIN.</li>
    <li> For years I had chronic dry itchy patches that would break out on my forehead and face, especially in the winter. It&#x27;s been over a year without an outbreak. This is now a staple in my morning and evening routine.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and the product I used to use is around $25 each. So I was very excited when I found out Aveeno is on sale and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Comes with basic sun protection&lt;br /&gt; - No strong fragrance&lt;br /&gt; - Absorbs well&lt;br /&gt; - Good Value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Don&#x27;t feel the difference in terms of moisturization&lt;br /&gt; - Texture is a bit too creamy for moisturizer/lotion&lt;br /&gt; - Have to use with a night cream to stay moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would keep the night cream, but probably switch to another daily lotion when I finish this one.</li>
    <li> Greasy, heavy moisturizer that sat on my skin and didn&#x27;t get absorbed.  Probably just as well it didn&#x27;t get absorbed because it would have clogged my pores, creating pimples. I went outside on a windy day and most of it ended up in my hair.  Much better products available for a lot less money.  The only thing I really like about Aveeno products is the fragrance.  They&#x27;ll all over-priced for being so inferior.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read about this product on numerous websites - you are either a fan of the Aveeno Ultra Calming line, or hate it.  I&#x27;m a major fan.  My pharmacist suggested I try it for dry, broken out rosacea skin.  My face was smooth and \\&quot;calm\\&quot; within days. I use the cleanser 2x day and lotion once a day.  For me, the lotion scent is light and refreshing. I&#x27;d like to see a version that is sunscreen free because my eyes are very sensitive--my solution is not to put it around my crowsfeet!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit acne prone and very sunburn prone, so I need a sunscreen that is also easy on my skin. Most products irritate me and make my face red, but this is gentle and provides good protection. The only downside is that it will wash off if I start to work up a sweat, but for most days it works perfectly. Highly recommended for daily use for anyone with similar issues.</li>
    <li> I have mild rosacea that seems to flare up most in the winter. I was afraid to try this product at first because I usually get bad allergic reactions to products with fragrance. I began using this moisturizer along with the calming cleanser. After a few days, I noticed the redness in my skin had lessened quite a bit. The fragrance didn&#x27;t enflame my skin. I was really happy with these products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after about a month or so, I noticed the products were no longer effective. The skin on my cheeks and nose are red and dry. I have dry patches all over my face. I&#x27;m going to stop using aveeno for awhile and see if it gets worse or better. I&#x27;m really disappointed since the results were so good at first!</li>
    <li> Best face moisturizer ever.</li>
    <li> This lotion was not mild enough for my sensitive skin. It caused a burning sensation on my face.</li>
    <li> I insist on wearing moisturizer with spf of at least 15. This is good for my somewhat sensitive skin that is rather oily in the t-zone and normal in summer but dry in winter cheeks. Feels good. Not heavy. Not too light.</li>
    <li> this stuff calms sensitive skin, and has sunscreen. It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> Amazing lotion!  I have sensitive skin, so I spent years trying to find a lotion that didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout in hives.  This is it!  Its non-greasy, feels light, and its SPF 15, which is great for daily wear!</li>
    <li> My regular facial moisturizer seemed to stop working when I was suffering a time with chronically dry skin, no it wasn&#x27;t a sun burn, perhaps allergies, but during that time I tried Aveeno Active Naturals Calming Daily Moisturizer.  I purchased it because it stated that it was for sensitive skin, especially for individuals suffering rosacea, although I wasn&#x27;t suffering from rosacea I felt that it suggested the product would be extra gentle.  Also it has SPF which is very important to me.  When I used the moisturizer I noticed that it was heavily perfumed and against better judgement put it on my face, it made it burn uncomfortable.  I threw it away.  My regular moisturizer wouldn&#x27;t make my face burn.&lt;br /&gt;I have to ask why would any moisturizer for sensitive skin be heavily fragranced?  I was very disappointed because I always had a good impression of Aveeno products, I guess the advertising and the neutral \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look of the packaging and image of the brand worked on me and the samples I&#x27;ve tried of other Aveeno moisturizers seemed to work well with my personal \\&quot;normal skin.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad this product has worked for some individuals, but personally I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  I&#x27;d recommend Purpose or CeraVe moisturizers instead.  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week and it seems to be doing a decent job in keeping my flushing, caused by Rosacea, in check. I haven&#x27;t noticed it has done all that much with the bumps caused by the Rosacea, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate or increase them either.  It does tend to be a bit drying for me...I only use once a day, in the morning, and use Aveeno Intense Relief at night (although I have sensitive skin, the heavier intense relief cream does not irritate or aggravate my symptoms).  I would give this 3 1/2 stars...not a miracle moisturizer by any means, but definitly a marked difference with the flushing, especially after eating.</li>
    <li> This lotion consistently irritated my skin. It made my skin itchy, inflamed, red, and finally flaky. There is definitely something in it that is very inflammatory for my skin. I gave it a few tries on different occasions, in case it was coincidence, but it turned out it was definitely the lotion causing the irritation. It finally went into the trash, and I&#x27;m looking for an alternative product for my daily sunscreen. It was particularly disappointing because this is marketed as ultra-calming, reducing redness, etc., but it did the opposite of all of those things for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Moisturizer for 2 1/2 years and it has really helped my complexion. I have naturally very pink cheeks, trust me I&#x27;ll never need to use blush in my life. This moisturizer has helped tone down the redness a bit, and instead of looking sunburned I have that rosy look most women try to achieve with $20 blush.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I will use on my face. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth every penny! You don&#x27;t need much, and it leaves my skin moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea around my nose and this moisturizer helps calm the redness down. The spf is a plus!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have some redness on my face; nothing extreme, but annoying all the same. I had heard the reviews were good for this product and I really like Aveeno&#x27;s products, so I decided to try it out. I really wanted this product to work, but it just didn&#x27;t. It smells amazing, but does absolutely nothing for the redness on my face. Will not be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> I use this and the tinted version every single day.  I love that it has the SPF built in because I believe you need that year round, not just at the beach.  I am hoping not to look 80 when I am 60.  I mix this with a bit of the tinted on my finger-tips to get a higher SPF and so that it is not too dark.  This works well for me. It is a great moisturizer and boy do I know it if I forget to put it on.  My face says &amp;#34;ahhh&amp;#34; when it goes on.  Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I like this product for under my make-up. It&#x27;s light and not greasy feeling. It also leaves my skin soft and smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, as well as eczema, and I use this on my face every day. I love having the sunscreen included. It does a little to help the eczema redness, not a whole lot, but it does more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> Seems like a nice enough moisturizer, but it&#x27;s loaded with heavy fragrance. Was looking for something natural, not perfume for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Wear it every day. Need more</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the Aveeno red reducing cream and figured out this is the newest version of that. It isn&#x27;t advertised anymore on the front that it reduces redness but it does on the back of the bottle. I think it works but doesn&#x27;t take away the red completely</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other face lotions since I started using this Aveeno lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t give you that greasy feeling and more importantly it does a great job of keeping my face from getting burnt by this hot Florida sun.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Target for 15 bucks, so this is definitely a better deal than that. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 5 days, but I already like it. It&#x27;s opaque white but it&#x27;s thin enough that it&#x27;s very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave a tint on my fair and red complexion. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and it&#x27;s good enough to use in the summer. However, it did break me out on my nose, which is my main breakout area and which barely ever breaks out by itself.  My nose is oily compared to my dry/normal face, so I would definitely not recommend this for oily or very sensitive skin. I just avoid my nose when putting this on and hope the rest doesn&#x27;t break out.</li>
    <li> I have been using the skinceuticals CE Ferrulic since January (my favorite product so far along with the simply clean cleanser). In the past month I added AOX+ Eye gel in a.m. and A.G.E. eye cream at night, Phyto corrective gel in morning and evening, retexturing activator in evening and after my moisturizer (Aveeno ultra calming) I add in the morning the Skinceuticals physical UV defense spf 30 sunscreen. My skin started looking brighter when I first started the CE Ferrulic and it is looking overall better with the recent additions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a while. I liked it before, but I love it in conjunction with the skinceutical line. I&#x27;m reluctant to switch to a skinceutical moisturizer - I love the Aveeno. My skin is so smooth with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Again, overall, people have noticed a change in my skin, stating it looks brighter and &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; without solicitation. I will edit my review or write a new one if I notice anything different in the coming months.</li>
    <li> Okay, straight up: fragrance does not belong in moisturizer, period full stop. My skin is extremely sensitive and irritable, and I have to be really careful what I put on it. I used the 30 SPF in this product line for years, and it never caused me any problems. (Actually, I switched from Neutrogena some years ago because it started to cause stinging when applied, and the 30 SPF was a welcome relief.)  When I went to put the SPF 15 on my face, I was dismayed to realize that the product contained a fragrance. I didn&#x27;t have any other moisturizer with sunscreen in the house, so I had no choice but to use it. Now my face is itchy and hot, and I am filing a report with J&amp;J&#x27;s hotline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr Bad for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Aveeno is infamous for its natural ingredient product. The ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer that came in is the real product, no fake. It looks as advertised and a quite big bottle. As for result, my skin has never been as radiant and bright as ever. The good thing about this moisturizer is how much can go a long way. I am able to a bottle for about five months.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Love it, its the only thing that actually reduces redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a visible difference. I usually mix it with rosehip oil.</li>
    <li> Keep trying to switch to something else - not sure why.  I ALWAYS come back to this.  It never breaks me out, in fact it clears me up.  Nice and light and perfect for me.</li>
    <li> moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and this was not irritating, nice consistency&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy stays on and moisturizers the face very well</li>
    <li> This is another excellent topical moisturizer that not only calms Rosecea but also helps in acting as an wonderful SPF protective layer.  Watch the use of it around your eyes it can irritate mine and cause them to tear.  I avoid putting any where near my eyes.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it. Fragrance too strong. I thought that &amp;#34;ultra calming&amp;#34; would be free of irritating fragrance... That assumption was wrong.</li>
    <li> Works well in conjunction with the cleanser. The cleanser is better at reducing my redness issues than the lotion.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and this moisturizer works well with my skin. I have spent a lot of money on moisturizers and this one is really good.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I suffer from a slight case of rosacea and it helps to eliminate the redness. I will continue to buy this product as long as they continue to sell it.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  So glad you have it at a reasonable price.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It works great. Moisturizes well and helps hide the natural red in my face.  SPF seems to work well too.</li>
    <li> Best product that I have found on the market. Use in am and pm</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and Aveeno usually works very well, but the Positiviely Radiant moisturizer was beginning to not be as soothing as it used to be.  Aveeno has always been a great product, but I wanted to try a different moisturizer when I came across this calming moisturizer.  I could not find it in the stores, so I ordered it online; the first time I used it was amazing.  Instead of a slight burning sensation I would feel with the other lotion, I felt a coolness.  I continue to use the calming moisturizer on a daily basis; it wears well underneath my makeup and I no longer have that irritated feeling.</li>
    <li> I love the SPF on this cream and how moisturizing it is. Highly recommend for dry skin and for daily use after exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Love this product but only 4 bc the cap always always always gives me trouble stopping pumping it out and I manually have to shake it out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell and therefore will not use it nor buy again. I like other Aveeno products, but not this one.</li>
    <li> I started using this in conjunction with the Aveeno extra calming foaming facial wash in an effort to battle the rosacea around my nose and mouth, and IT WORKED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d had rosacea spots for years that would dry out and itch &amp; nothing worked to get rid of them until I tried these two products.  I would have given 5 stars; however, I have used better moisturizers (and facial washes), BUT, none of them eliminated the spots on my face.  At night, I just use a heavy moisturizing cream, and that seems to work okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not saying this will work for everyone, but this worked like a charm for me!</li>
    <li> I had rosacea pretty bad. My skin was blotchy and I had flare ups often and I have sensitive skin as well. This product (along with a change in diet) cleared it right up. My skin looks even and glowing and I get many compliments on how good it looks. Also, I do not wear foundation. If anyone has rosacea and is having a hard time finding a moisturizer give this a try!</li>
    <li> Once I turned 40, my skin went wacko. Everything I used to use, whether it be lotion, face cream, makeup, or anything that touched my skin, I would break out in weird bumps and itch like crazy. I&#x27;ve had to completely change all of my products. This is the only thing that can touch my face and not cause a reaction. It is silky smooth and even works well around my delicate eye area. I do love this lotion.</li>
    <li> So weird, have no idea why this cream works for my rosacea, but it does. Usually scented creams make my skin break out, but this has done the opposite, getting rid of my rosacea papules. The first time I used it, I woke up, looked in the mirror, and thought I was coming down with something as my face was so pale! My skin still does get a little &amp;#34;rosy&amp;#34; as the day goes on, but my roscea is so much better. My GP even asked what I was using so she could share with other patients. I also bought the foaming cleanser, but unfortunately, that one does make me break out. Rosacea is such a frustrating condition as there is not one solution that works for everyone, but hopefully this cream will provide some relief to fellow sufferers. I&#x27;m in big trouble if they ever stop making it though!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful that this would actually reduce redness. It doesn&#x27;t. It actually caused my skin to flake. There was nothing calming about it. It even has a strong smell, which I would not have expected from this company. I won&#x27;t buy it again. For those reading reviews, note that many of the good reviews here are not for this product. Instead, they are for a cleanser. This is a moisturizer...but in my experience, more of an irritant to my skin.</li>
    <li> wife loves this.....best price around so no brainer</li>
    <li> Aveeno Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer really works! I have Rosecea and this product is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that actually eliminates the red on my face. After using it for 10 days or so, my face completely cleared up.</li>
    <li> I am a picky person who is constantly looking for a better product. I have used higher end products such as Lush that carry huge price tags, desperate to make my angry, dry, bumpy and red skin happy. Many products have worked temporarily but with changing climates and the incredibly cold Vermont winters, nothing lasted...until this. Seriously. I love this moisturizer. It is also small enough to toss in a bag if you are going for a walk or a hike in the winter and you want to keep your face from drying out. It is great. I have also mixed it with my foundation for a smoother and less-flaky application. I hope they never stop making this.</li>
    <li> Smells really great but the price is the same as target price</li>
    <li> It was bought for my grandson who has a problem with acne which was very dry.  Aveeno dried his skin and reddened it. I bought him Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne Solutions and it has helped.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and smell of it when you first open the bottle and with the cleanser and toner my face seems to be getting back to the ph level for nice skin. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I needed to find a new moisturizer and decided to give this one a try because it says it has chamomile and such. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I noticed a positive change in my skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> If you have a problem with Rosacea as I do, ultra calming daily moisturizer really has helped my itchy skin, I use it in the morning before applying makeup and at night before bed.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this stuff!!! I am approaching 50 and red wine seems to be causing me to suffer from Rosacea ??? Someon recommended that I try this product and it really really helps get rid of the red bumps!! When I switched to white wine and this product my skin seems clear... knock on wood! but I love the consistency and the sunscreen and everything about this product I am sold for life on it!!</li>
    <li> I could not buy this great product in Australia as for some reason taken off shelves. After menopause I had problem with flushes which brought on broken veins and this product ha helped no end.  Cannot understand why this wonderful product is not in Australia unless I pay heaps for a branded name which has the same results!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and eczema. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, along with the similar facewash. In the last few months I&#x27;ve had a major eczema flare-up on my face. I thought that this product was keeping it from being worse. It wasn&#x27;t helping it get better and now I know why! My friend suggested that I look around for new products. So I started looking around for what other people with eczema were using. I found some information which stopped me from using this product immediately. It said that there were skin irritants in the formula which could actually continue my problem, if not make it worse That information made me really angry, especially since I&#x27;ve depended on Aveeno to help me with my eczema since I was a kid. I thought I could trust that it would help me, not hurt me. Here&#x27;s the link for what I found: http://www.primephysiquenutrition.com/whats-the-top-harshest-ingredients-you-should-avoid/ I hope this helps other people that have eczema like I do, but who don&#x27;t know what to do about it (like I didn&#x27;t).</li>
    <li> My face is very sensitive and I have redness on my cheeks. I was a bit worried about using this at first as several creams claim to be &#x27;calming&#x27;, but this really is a lovely delicate cream.  The texture is light and easy to apply.  Compared to some other creams in my bathroom this is by far the cheapest but what value!! The only reason I have given it four stars and not five is because I&#x27;d prefer no scent or a scent similar to their body range (this has a delicate floral scent).</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for at least 7 years and I never use any other moisturizer on my face. It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily (and trust me, it&#x27;s already quite oily on its own), and I love having daily SPF.</li>
    <li> Does the job, moisturizes, clams my skin, no irritation.  Need very little.  Very happy with product at a very reasonable beauty product price.</li>
    <li> I was a guinea pig for aveeno products!!! yes I was approached many!!! many!!! years ago to use a product of theirs before it came on the market...they are very customer friendly company and they truly want your feed back!! when I testing  my product it was a bit too oily for me... since I have combination and sensitive skin....this is a good one!!! did not exist back then!!! WOW aveeno you have come a long way!!! Happy to say I was part of helping it happen!!!!hopefully I will see one of these in a spf 30!!!! its  a bit too thick and not enough sunscreen...</li>
    <li> This has been the only moisturizer that I use for 10 years now. I have dry, fair skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great and smells wonderful. It works well for my combination, sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> The texture is very soft, without any excitement. It is very comfortable and I was like it very much.I love it.</li>
    <li> Aveeno decided to discontinue their previous version of this product and now is no longer fragrance free, what a shame, the smell is very strong. Can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought countless daily moisturizers, including 100 percent natural products with five-star Amazon reviews and NO SPF ingredients.  They all made my red facial blotches glow brighter. When I found Aveeno Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer locally, I bought it immediately at a higher price, not even waiting to order from Amazon.  Please don&#x27;t be scared off by reviews about red bumps or other horrors.  Aveeno&#x27;s product is the first one that faded my red blotches no nutritional supplement or other treatment has helped and offered daytime SPF 15 sun protection, too!  I also like L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Daily Serum I&#x27;m trying for the first time, but I bet it won&#x27;t fade the red blotches.</li>
    <li> Its the only lotion I ever use on my face. thanks</li>
    <li> someone passed a bottle to me. It worked very well on my very sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I live at high altitude in a dry climate and have combination skin.  After seeing some of the excellent reviews on this product, I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve previously used some of Aveeno&#x27;s lotions and liked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after a couple of days of use, my entire face broke out in a rash.  I stopped using it immediately, but 24 hours later, the rash is still very visible and quite uncomfortable.  I wish I&#x27;d listened to the other reviewer who said that Avobenzone was a known irritant*, but unlike that reviewer, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d react the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m not positive this is the ingredient that got me, since I once previously got a rash from one of Olay&#x27;s products, which contained octinoxate instead -- an ingredient this one shares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a warning to all: this is an irritant not only to people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t cause breakouts !!</li>
    <li> This works fantastically and when used with other products in the line as well as the Clinique &#x27;clarifying lotion&#x27; can remove virtually all redness and even enhances healing.  Likely lifetime user.</li>
    <li> I have to say this item has to have 10 out of 10 for quality and satisfaction ,I have been using it for 3 years and was introduced to it in America when we were on holiday.&lt;br /&gt;Since we came on line and found yourselves as agents for it we now buy from you.&lt;br /&gt;  yours faithfully&lt;br /&gt;  Brenda Stanley</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and this facial lotion is a life-saver.  No more rash, no pimples and I have built-in sunscreen every day!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer and sun screen is great for my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff because I have a problem with what I call redface. My cheeks look so red like I always put too much blush on, and it drives me nuts. This stuff worked alright when used consistently, but I have actually tossed the bottle aside because I&#x27;ve found something [cheaper] that works way better for awesome clear, bright, even skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face with coconut oil, throw on some witch hazel for toner, then rub a tiny chunk of that all natural shea butter in my palms and gently smooth it over my face and eyes and lips (and feet!) for moisturizer. Works way better than a bottle of chemicals and lasts forever. And don&#x27;t worry about the oil giving you pimples. It&#x27;s taken care of my pesky blackheads and I&#x27;ve seriously never had better skin. I&#x27;m not sure what one could do for that spf 15, though, since sunscreen tends to clog my pores... I would suggest a bb cream or something, but you really don&#x27;t need any makeup when doing this.</li>
    <li> This one helps my eczema!!  I apply it after i shower at night and before I go to work in the morning and this stuff really make my eczema go away.  I have super sensitive and allergic prone skin, and due to the valley all and stress I go through at work my face ends up breaking out with irritation and redness.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and this stuff prevents all that!!  Thank you Aveeno!</li>
    <li> Works great for my sensitive skin, not greasy and is a good moisturizer for the hot summer months.  During the winter months I have to use additional moisturizer</li>
    <li> I love the Aveeno Calming Foam Cleanser. However, I was disappointed to find that the moisturizer/sunscreen from this line is fragranced. I have rosacea and experience a burning sensation when I put this on. I would suggest to Aveeno that the remove the fragrance, especially since this is marketed to people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love aveeno products. have sensitive skin and redness in my face. Using this product really has helped reduce the redness.</li>
    <li> Ironically enough, a product that is manufactured for sensitive skin actually made my skin break out in hive-like bumps. It felt like my face was on fire! I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to a beauty product before, so this was completely unexpected. This is also the first Aveeno product that I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;m not sure that I will ever be brave enough to try their products again!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea on my face and this helps control the redness and dry skins. It goes on smooth and not oily. I would recommend this to anyone to use this on the face.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne prone skin (which also tends to get red and irritated). Combined with some other moisturizers, I have found a decent balance for my skin, so I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> For the last few months my face has been horribly dry and flaky. Not to mention about 2 weeks ago I noticed my cheeks we so dry they were all red and burned. I bought a moisturzier that was for any skin type and that didnt work. It would help for a few but then my face would dry out agian. And everytime I wash my face or get out the shower my face drys out instantly. So I work I decided to browes some products that dont have water in it or and other strong chemicals, and I found this. AMAZING!!!!!! Instantly I can tell a difference my face is soft and glowing and not all dryed and flaky. Also my cheeks aren&#x27;t red anymore. It also smells good. I have also picked up a freeman facial mask that will help renew my skin so to speak. Its the aleo vera and willow one. So if you have dry sensitive skin this is a must have!!!! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Ever since I found this lotion, I won&#x27;t be without it.  Rosacea has no known cure, but when a face feels uncomfortably hot and a light application of this cream makes it feel more comfortable - that&#x27;s a big deal. Calming is what it does. It&#x27;s aptly named. I use it at night and under makeup by day, and whenever my face feels hot or dry, almost like an ointment.  It&#x27;s light and has no fragrance - other good points.  It goes a long way too, so it&#x27;s a real value.</li>
    <li> This worked well as a mild sunscreen and moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> I like it so much that I go through the trouble to order this item from the U.S. as they dont sell it here in Australia.  I have the ultra-calming SPF 30 only once so I dont have an opinion on that as yet (but I do have high hopes!)</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  I wish they made a night cream in the same, ultra calming type. In fact, they used to make a night cream version but I can no longer find it in the ultra calming formula.</li>
    <li> Great product to wear under your makeup and has your sunscreen in the product for your face.</li>
    <li> Needed a facial moisturizer with sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Tried Aveeno Ultra-Calming and to my surprise noticed the rosacea redness on my face was clearing up. I&#x27;ve had rosacea for 20 years and I still have it, but it is less noticeable now. The lotion is lightweight and not greasy. It works great under the liquid and mineral powder foundation combo that I use. My new favorite moisturizer!</li>
    <li> by far the best lotion to use with any skin peel.  I only use it after the second day as the first 2 days you should use neosporin.  I always recommend this to all my clients.  It soothes skin and reduces irritation and redness that are so common with skin peels.</li>
    <li> This product with calming feverfew calms razor burn (anywhere-bikini area) better than any product I&#x27;ve used!!  Moisturizes well.  Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I love the Ultra Calming portion of this moisturizer.  My skin becomes red fairly easily except when I use this product.  I also appreciate the additional sun screen.</li>
    <li> This is not moisturizer! It is SPF only! Burns my eyes :-(</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this cream</li>
    <li> I have dry/oily skin that&#x27;s prone to blackheads and breakouts and this moisturiser is fantastic. It absorbs beautifully without leaving any greasy residue and makes my skin feel incredibly smooth and soft. I use it in the mornings before I apply primer and makeup and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my skin. It claims to &#x27;calm&#x27; red/irritated skin and this definitely works for me - my makeup looks a lot better now because my skin tone is more even after applying this moisturiser. Overall, it&#x27;s highly effective and well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Purchased for elderly mother who has very dry skin. She loves it.</li>
    <li> It keeps my roseate under control.  Daily usage.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Not calming at all. Has perfume or some other additive</li>
    <li> This is the best face lotion</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I use for my face. If you have sensitive skin - buy this! I live by it.</li>
    <li> I really loved this moisturizer until the day I discovered that it was the reason I had orange bleach stains on my lovely sage colored towels.  I have always found a few small orange spots on my towels from time to time but blamed the washer or some of my other face products on these spots.  However, one day after I washed my face within a few hours of applying this moisturizer, I found the true culprit. I thought I had washed my face thoroughly but found two very large (about the size of my face) and very noticeable orange stains on my towel about 12 hours after I used it to dry my face.  Since the towel was already ruined, I decided to run some tests to find out what caused this horrible discoloration.  I found one or two of my face products did discolor the towel slightly.  However, I applied a very small amount of this moisturizer to the towel and found that it turned into the most brilliant orange color.  It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, but keep it away from your expensive towels, or buy orange towels.</li>
    <li> I am male and had mild rosacea since I was a teenager. My cheeks turned red easily from only slight stimuli like wind, sun, being tired and they stayed red for hours. I blushed easily too.&lt;br /&gt;After having this condition for 15+ years this is the first product that helped.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have no more red cheeks and my facial redness is greatly reduced. It has a long lasting effect for me which means even if I do not apply it for a few days the redness does not return. I have been using it almost every day for 6 months now - the effect was visible after only 5 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from constantly red cheeks, chronic flushing or blushing, try this one. I mainly apply it before I go to bed and just a little in the morning as it is slightly greasy. I use it as a sunscreen and apply it as after sun lotion as well. It seems that one bottle will last about a year for me. This is a great product and I can highly recommend it !</li>
    <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s oil free and its hypoallergenic. I use it everyday! I have very sensitive skin, and Rosacea, and this particular product works wonders on me. It also reduces my redness. I&#x27;ve used this for years and stuck with this calming moisturizer, everything else just hasn&#x27;t worked as well as this one!</li>
    <li> Very good, sensitive skin rub nor adverse reaction</li>
    <li> I have itchy, patchy skin on face and my skin is sensitive.  This stuff smells nice and is a great moisturizer but didn&#x27;t help my itchy face anyway. Didn&#x27;t seem to work better than anything else.</li>
    <li> This smells nice and clean, goes on smooth and feels great. Best moisterizer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I replaced my bliss face lotion with this Aveeno moisturizer.  It is difficult to find a 15 SPF lotion, that is an oil base and it a sensitive skin product.  This is a great value and I don&#x27;t think you can compare to it unless you spend a lot more.</li>
    <li> I have a habit of only reading the good reviews when I&#x27;m excited about a product, but I wish I&#x27;d delved into the 1-2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I typically have problem skin--usually whiteheads.  Once I started using this stuff, I began developing big, cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;I could not understand what was causing such a flare up!  The only other time I had such big bumps was due to a crazy amount of salicylic acid I rubbed on my face (one of my desperate moments).&lt;br /&gt;Also, I noticed when I&#x27;d scratch my face, dry flakes would appear....&lt;br /&gt;This Aveeno product was slam-dunked into the trashcan real quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problem skin, I&#x27;d advise you to look into more natural moisturizers.  I went back to my Yes to Carrots line, and I woke up with non-irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait til this mess clears up though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become religious about this lotion. I was originally intrigued by the &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; guarantee since I have super reactive/dry Utah skin. I loved it, because it really does seem to calm down irritated skin and the acne that I got with it. Then , a cosmetologist criticized me for my drugstore lotion, and I tried all the expensive stuff-- glymed, natura bisse, etc. They were all nice but my face still ended up feeling dry, itchy and irritated in the evenings with increased redness and breakouts. I&#x27;ve gone back to Aveeno and my skin feels like its stopped freaking out again. Great product, good price, thanks Aveeno. The only other product I&#x27;ve found to be as calming is a glymed botanical face mask that is Frankenstein green and I just couldn&#x27;t figure a way to wear it out of the house or afford it on a regular basis. wink.</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive skin, and finding a lotion wit sun screen witch don&#x27;t irritate May face is very difficult. But http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IJ1PBK/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5 is the right one. I don&#x27;t get irritated after I use it.</li>
    <li> Old customer for this product</li>
    <li> Perfect for my fair, redness-prone face.  Light and non-greasy, but definitely works as a moisturizer and sunscreen.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So far I am really enjoying this, it&#x27;s helping to calm the red patches on my face.</li>
    <li> Have been using aveeno from heat to toe for at least 4-5 yrs now and won&#x27;t use anything else. Non greasy and it just gives your skin this radient glow.</li>
    <li> best for the purpose compared to other products</li>
    <li> Initially I was glad to find a product that might actually work without making my eyes burn, water or  turn my face red. For about three days it was nice to be able to moisturize, then the burning sensation began. It felt like my skin had been scrubbed off of my face,  and a large sore was making its way from my chin to my mouth which felt like  a straight pin had been inserted into my chin. I new that it was an allergic reaction when my skin around the site also bacame scaly and tender to the touch. Since I use a cpap machine, I would wake up in the middle of the night with red rashes (dry skin) all over my face. I ended up putting Band-Aids all over the rashes just so the CPAP machine didn&#x27;t continue to rub them until they bled or to the point where I just could not sleep despite a Rx sleep med.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to think of what new thing had entred my life and I started eliminating everything one by one, which isn&#x27;t many when you are allergic to so many. I was totally suprised to discover that the Aveeno \\&quot;Calming\\&quot; moisturizer was the comon denominator. Tonight I have my face covered in light olive oil to try to relieve some of the painful dry skin before donning my CPAP machine. Last night was a nightmare. I hope they take this product off the market. This was on of the worst reaction that  I&#x27;ve ever had on my face in years and I do not want someone else suffering when they don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used much more expensive creams and this made my sensitive/rosacea skin so much softer, smoother, silkier and younger looking. It evens out my skin tone, and even my husband has commented how much softer my face feels. I never forget to use it because when I have forgotten, I can feel the difference in my skin, and I want that &amp;#34;Aveeno&amp;#34; feeling back. Love this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for several years to manage rosacea. I have tried other moisturizers before but I this Aveeno works for me best.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno&#x27;s Ultra Calming products, including this moisturizer.  I have very sensitive skin and find this moisturizer to be a good weight to last all day and not give me any skin problems.  Also, the SPF 15 is great!</li>
    <li> I expected a moisturizer with sunscreen.  I don&#x27;t see any moisturizer listed in the ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer cream. I would recommend it to anyone, especially is you have any blemishes. I have been using this product for a while. I have been pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a great moisturizer with a sunscreen for this summer and found the perfect one in this product.  Worked great to protect my skin from the sun this summer.</li>
    <li> Not the heaviest moisturizer - this one is actually a bit light, but it&#x27;s nice in that it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residual, and doesn&#x27;t cause acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> It might be calming for some people but not for me.  I developed a  red rash and hade to discontinue using it.  .</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have rosacea and was hoping it would help to tone down the red. I was skeptical but after only three applications I could see a difference. It is also a great moisturizer. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me years ago by my derm and I use it every day and sometimes even at night. It does not irritate my skin and foundations glide over it nicely.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for sensitive skin, absorbs well and feels soothing. Would have 5 stars if the SPF was a bit higher (only 15).</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and I purchased this after reading all of the positive reviews about this product. I purchased this during holidays, but I didn&#x27;t use it until last week. The first time used, I got red rash all of very my face. I thought it might be some bad coincident. So I tried again couple of days later, again, my face started having rash. And it&#x27;s too late to return this item since it&#x27;s over 30 days. I even bought two bottles. Now they have to go to the trash can!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product when I started taking Accutane and my face turned this deep sunburnt lobster color...and no I am not kidding. Within just a few days of using this product the red was completly gone!! I still use it to this day because I have very super sensitive skin that pretty much rejects 99.9% of products, but not this one.It does exactly what it says it does, it calms and soothes your skin. Just a few weeks ago my the skin on the backs of my hands freaked out and developed a red rash I think was associated with overwashing and winter weather conditions. I used regular lotion on them and my hands immediately stung and felt like they were BURNING!! So I washed them and used this lotion and instant RELIEF was felt. I Love this stuff! LOVVVVVEEEE!! Did I mention it smells amazing too?? Best facial lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I will never use another.</li>
    <li> Perfect daily moisturizer for me. Calms my redness &amp; doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I buy it regularly. I wish they still had a night cream.</li>
    <li> Trying to find a daily moisturizer for a cold, dry climate can be difficult. However, I find that Aveeno is the perfect balance between keeping my skin from drying out without making it oily.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product but she only gives it four stars because it is SPF15.  If the SPF was 30 or more, she would give it five stars.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is AMAZING!  I picked it up on a whim since my skin is drying out from the cold, windy weather and I found it on clearance at a big box store.  I used it for the first time last night, and it did wonders in just ONE NIGHT!  To give some background--I am almost 30 and still have very acne prone skin (I break out at least twice a month, more depending on how stressed I am.)  I have some rosacea, and this took the rosiness out over night (which of course probably just means my skin was very dry.)  Not very greasy and my skin absorbed it quickly.  It has been about 12 hours now since I&#x27;ve used it, and my face doesn&#x27;t even feel greasy or a nagging feeling that I have to wash it soon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still probably use my acne lotion during the day, but this will definitely be my go-to at night for the foreseeable future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/19/12:  I&#x27;ve been using this face lotion for a little over a month, and I STILL love it.  It hasn&#x27;t gotten cold enough for my face to start drying out too much, but it has still worked wonders!  It gets a lot of the redness out of my blemishes (I blame them on the fact that I&#x27;ve gotten lazy about washing my face twice a day, and I&#x27;ve been ridiculously stressed out from finals week and preparing for the holidays) and calms them down a lot so they can heal faster.  I&#x27;ve upgraded my review to 5 stars as well, since it is really a great lotion that has worked wonders even with my finicky skin type :)  (Combination, but if I use something for too long it causes me to break out within the first month of using it.)</li>
    <li> All my adult life I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding products that don&#x27;t leave a sheen or shine on my oily t-zone face, and apparently, this is one I&#x27;ve been looking for.  It&#x27;s very lightweight but you can still feel it--just not the thick icky feelings that creams and a lot of lotions have.  I put one pump in my hand, rub my hands together, and spread it gently on my face (sort of a gentle, brushing motion with my fingertips).  I use another pump for my neck, and one for the backs of my hands (I&#x27;m 60--it&#x27;s more work now...).  I&#x27;ve used it about 10 days, a.m. and p.m., in combo with a retinol treatment and I&#x27;m really happy with the product.  No sheen, no irritation, no redness, no heavy feeling, etc.  Price is right, too.</li>
    <li> Aveeno Active Naturals Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer:&lt;br /&gt;Every year when it turns cold, my skin dries out and my cheeks get unusually red. I never gave it much thought, just accepted it as the way things were- until someone in my office decided to make fun of me in front of others. Well I didn&#x27;t get mad, I got even. With a couple of minutes searching the web I came across this lotion &amp; read the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;So, I purchased it wondering whether it would work for me. Much to my surprise, it did- literally overnight. It got rid of the redness. Now I look normal again, and the jokester in my office doesn&#x27;t have anything to say anymore.  I use it every day now. Living well truly is the best revenge.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Aveeno!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist as well as a local pharmacist for my rosacea prone skin.  I found that it did not work for my skin type, however.  It left my skin greasy and caused breakouts.  It has not helped my redness at all but has not made it worse either. .  I have been using it for 2 weeks and cannot any more.  I constantly feel like I need to wash my face.  This might work for other people, but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer and the smell. Very fresh scent and not too strong, plus I love the fact it has sunscreen in it. I have the other moisturizer, but like this one better.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product to help in the control of facial redness. Like the SPF too as you know your face is protected from the sun on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Love the Aveeno Daily Moisturizer. Use it everyday - not too oily and still provides sun protection. Amazon prices were lower than lower drug stores and walmart. Very happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Been using it since I got it in the mail (few weeks now) so far it has cleared up almost my entire face from redness! I especially use it when am going out and need the sunblock. It leaves my skin smelling nice and smoother. I am sensitive to smell and if my lotion smells strong I begin to sneeze but not with this. It is nice to see my face finally clearing up without any dryness! It has definitely come a long way and this product is good for its price here on amazon. I might increase the rating if it finishes clearing up my face a bit more, I still have some redness around my nose but no longer elsewhere like my cheeks. When you apply it it does have a tan looking color but it is absorbed and leaves no residue if you apply it evenly. I might be a bit more sensitive then I thought because the first 2 times or so I didn&#x27;t respond as well until continuous use I saw my skin clear up. Like I felt a tingly sensation not sure if it was because its new on my skin or something or if that is how it works. I recommend it but if your skin does not seem to take well with it after some use stop applying it.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, it is very soothing to my skin. Not oily at all and feels and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and the Ultra-calming description sounded like a perfect fit for me.  Too bad they added a frangrance which not only irritates my skin, it bothers my sinuses too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years.  It&#x27;s great.  It leaves my skin soft and supple and not greasy.  But what I really like about it is it&#x27;s calming effect on my skin.  My cheeks and nose are always ruddy but worse after I wash my face.  Aveeno Ultra Calming Moisturizer makes the redness go away and I look normal again.  I like that it works well under makeup and has the added benefit of SPF15.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have VERY sensitive skin....... this is the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make me break-out</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be calming. It has a very powerful fragrance of some flower. Cant handle it. I gave it away</li>
    <li> I have very dry/ red skin on my hands and this is the only product that helps them.  I apply a little in the morning and after showers and they feel and look better for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that the pump does a very poor job of pulling the lotion up once 3/4 of the bottle is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend even at the high price.</li>
    <li> I never tried the previous formula of this product, but I do know that this new formula is not meant for sensitive skin. Let me preface my review by stating that I have had pretty severe allergic reactions to some synthetic sunblocks before. II do fine with natural sunblocks on my skin (face or body) but don&#x27;t like the weight or the fact they are linked to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product after my doctor recommended I try this product, well aware of my skin allergies, to help with my very dry and sensitive skin. So, I tried it. Three weeks later after daily use I&#x27;ve have two pretty nasty allergic reactions to this product. The first time I was on vacation and thought I may have accidently brushed up against something that caused a small red bumpy patch to show up on my cheek. However, I knew by the second time I knew something wasn&#x27;t right. My ENTIRE face developed small red bumps that itched like crazy. It takes about a week before all signs of the reaction disappearing :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to have to agree with other reviewers that this product is not meant for sensitive skin. I will also have to agree that the smell is overbearing. Spend your money on something else.</li>
    <li> Lets see, good product or bad product. With this face lotion its not so easy to say. Let start by describing the body attached to the face. I&#x27;m a 44 year old male, with fair skin that irritated easily. I have been using this lotion for at least 7 years , but i don&#x27;t use it for it&#x27;s intended purpose. I mainly use it as after shave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I don&#x27;t like it as face cream is because it  does not absorb into my skin. I can put some on my face (not too much), and several hours later if I sweat a little (lets say walking up stairs), my face will feel like it has cooking oil on it. This is supremely annoying that hours after applying my face feels greasy. I have tried using it in humid environments, and dry dessert environments, and still the same. I&#x27;m writing this review because I used some on my face this morning, and now 2 hours later my face feels greasy. I find my face sweats more with this stuff also. It just does&#x27;nt breath. And of course (yes I know, you should never start a sentence with ¨and¨), acne soon follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now why would I possibly give this anything other than one star? Because as a after shave I find this stuff to be fantastic. This stuff kill razor burn like nobodies business. I have tried most other after shaves that claim to be calming, but none work as well as this stuff. Hell, none work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum up, yes I like aveeno calming after shave balm very much. I just wish they would correct the printing problem on the front of the bottle, lol.</li>
    <li> I use this every day as face moisturizer and on my kids in a pinch as sunscreen when we&#x27;re out.  It does leave my face slightly sticky compared to wearing nothing, but I don&#x27;t know if there is anything you can put on your skin that you wouldn&#x27;t notice.  Sun protection works well.</li>
    <li> Love this product. They have stopped bringing it into New Zealand and was really gutted. Then when I saw it was available on Amazon I was wrapped. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> Although I am disappointed the SPF 30 version is no longer available, I have not found another product with better benefits for my skin. This product reduces amount of breakouts as well as decreases how red and swollen my breakouts are! If I miss a day, my skin has more red inflamed areas, it is EXTREMELY SOOTHING and REDUCES BLEMISHES - truly amazing.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the original formula of ultra calming that used to come in a little jar. When I could no longer find it in the store I found this online and bought it thinking it was the same except now being in a pump bottle. HUGE MISTAKE! If you truly have sensitive skin and are prone to getting red itchy blotches this is not going to soothe them away, it is anything but calming. It had added fragrance, a HUGE NO NO for sensitive skin. It also contains SPF, which unfortunately I am also sensitive to. I can not use any spf in lotion form, it has taken me years to find an spf my face can tolerate and there s no reason in the world to use an SPF lotion at bedtime or when you are staying home, a fragrance free and spf version seems to no longer exist. This feels greasy, smells like sun block, and made my face red and itchy. shame on you aveeno. Bring back the original. You&#x27;ve gone from calming to calamity.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many moisturizers I have tried.....some VERY expensive and some cheap, but THIS works so well. I have sensitive skin and asked my dermatologist to recommend a moisturizer and she said to try this product. well, my search has finally ended! My skin feels so good, not dry, not oily, just smooth! I wash with the foaming wash and then apply this at night and I have to say, I don&#x27;t have to moisturize again in the morning before applying my makeup.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for two days so far, but I cannot use it any longer.  If you are all sensitive to fragance, do not use this product.  The perfume is so strong that my eyes burn all day long, in addition to headache and nausea.  I only tried it for a second day because I thought I might get used to it - wrong!  My skin, however, does feel very nice and calm, not sticky, the lotion itself is very nice (I have a milder form of rosacea) - so if fragrance does not bother you, it seems a very good sunscreen for those who suffer the burning and redness from rosacea.  A fragrance-free option would be fantastic, Aveeno!!!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is much stronger than I would have expected for a sensitive skin product. The product didn&#x27;t work well enough to overcome the overpowering scent.</li>
    <li> I have noticed such an improvement of my redness and irritation! I have struggled with red, irritated, dry skin for years. When I bought this moisturizer, I did not have very high expectations, but I have to say, I am completely in love now!! I have seen such a massive improvement in my skin and I owe it to this moisturizer. I did not change anything in my skin care routine, with the exception of this moisturizer, and I am now completely, 100% obsessed and cannot recommend this enough to anyone else who might be suffering with dry, red, irritated skin!! I have finally found my holy grail moisturizer!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and have had dry, sensitive skin since I was about 25. I mean as in red and raw in the winter, and sometimes flaking off. I&#x27;ve used Clinique, Estee Lauder, Lancome, Shiseido, and various other products. I even had a doctor prescribe Metrogel for rosacea, but it completely dried out my skin. Clinique worked for me, but about every 4 to 6 months, it would make me break out as if I had grown sensitive to it. I had to switch off and go back on after a week or so--and it still never worked as well as Aveeno Ultra Calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had had bad luck with other drugstore-type products, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I tried Aveeno, but that was about 4 years ago, and I&#x27;ve used nothing else since. My skin is clear, it&#x27;s not dry and doesn&#x27;t flake, and for the first time in my life (at least since my mid-20s), I don&#x27;t look like I have rosacea. I don&#x27;t know what they do, but this stuff is AMAZING! It costs less than all of those brands mentioned above, and it goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly by the skin. It&#x27;s not oily, and there&#x27;s no residue. As someone else mentioned in a review, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if they stopped making this product. It&#x27;s incredible and easily better--at least for me and my incredibly sensitive skin--than products costing 4 to 5 times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Aveeno Calming foaming cleanser, and I like that too, although I sometimes like to use something just a little stronger to get the top layer of dead skin off. Right now I use a Biore sensitive scrub every week or two, but for everyday use, I always go back to the Aveeno foaming cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw that someone mentioned that they discontinued the SPF 30 (2.5 oz). That&#x27;s too bad, because it was an excellent product in its own right. It went on a little thicker than the SPF 15, and it was a little more expensive, but I liked to use it occasionally, especially in the summer--because most sunscreens make me turn bright red just from putting them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thebest product for sensitive skin I&#x27;ve found, bar none.</li>
    <li> I have used the Ultra Calming Moisturizer for as long as it has been on the market.  It keeps my face as smooth as silk. I would never consider using any other product on my face.</li>
    <li> i cannot live w/out this product.  i use it every day!  nice thick moisturizer and great to have the extra spf15 protection w/out any sunscreen smell.  also helps w/reactive redness.</li>
    <li> This is great for people with naturally red tinted skin. I use it and the difference between my old red skin and my new pale, tan, non-red skin is amazing. It also protects my delicate skin from the sun. I use it every morning and I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  I am at that in between age (49-50) where it should be against the law to have wrinkles and zits but, alas... It isn&#x27;t too oily, not to drying and evens my skin tone a little (not in direct light of course but come on, it&#x27;s just a lotion!). I try other things but always end up back with Aveeno stuff.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say to use this if you have actual sensitive skin, but my skin can be picky sometimes and I love this product. It smells awesome too. I can see this being a little greasy for some, but I really prefer it over the positively radiant one.</li>
    <li> Great quality product I recommend it for people that don&#x27;t have acne prone skin:)</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Received  on time and no leakage. Lotion had not previously been opened!</li>
    <li> I tried the Aveeno brand with the ultra-calming soap first and I was surprised, now  I bought this moisturizer because I use make up everyday and to protect my skin it hasdone a pretty well job, plus it has  sunscreen, its like all in one!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great but does feel a little greasy after it is applied.  I like that my hands stay moisturized throughout the day depending on how much I was them of course.</li>
    <li> It works, is non clogging, and looks good. It is not a heavy cream that shows on the skin as such.</li>
    <li> so worth a try for anyone having a problem with dermatitis/eczema; it has helped me a lot!!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any sunscreen effect. I applied it half an hour before going out and still got spots under mild sun... But it did reduce my redness and flaking, my face does feel smooth and moisturized. I use it in the morning and use Vichy thermal water during the day to keep my face hydrated and calm. Together they work great.</li>
    <li> Feels nice on my skin, wears well under foundation or on it&#x27;s own, I think it helps with redness.</li>
    <li> after use, it is too dry for my baby&#x27;s skin,</li>
    <li> If  some of your ancestors are from Ireland or other certain northern climes there is a good chance that your will get some form of facial  redness or rosacea as you come into middle age. I just figured it was something you just had to deal with with aging, and was not interested in taking any prescriptions to try to get rid of it, as I already taken enough pills like blood pressure treatments, etc. Then I read online that this cream has the reputation of helping to clear rosacea. It is amazing, it actually works! I started putting it on my face before bedtime and it rather quickly cleared up my skin from the redness. After a while it seemed to have calmed my skin down, so that I don;t even put it on everyday, though I am prepared to do so if it gets red again. It really seems to have actually &amp;#34;calmed&amp;#34; my skin. Amazing, truly. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but actually a little goes a long way, and when I put it on, it only takes two dabs to cover my whole face. Great product! Wow!</li>
    <li> Best after shaving lotion on sensitive faces.  I just wish they would stop increasing the price.  In 5 years, this lotion has doubled in price.  Give us a break Aveeno!</li>
    <li> Received as expected.  Packaged well and secure.  However the item doesn&#x27;t give the results I expected.  Would not recomment this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno ultra calming for years and it is a wonderful product! I have mild rosacea and it reduces the redness. I highly recommend it!! I am very comfortable with this product!! (for the skin around the eye area I use Artistry replenishing eye creme).</li>
