      <li>Work great for me, love how the cap turns to lock.  </li>
      <li>The oil control is great, and I love the healthy glow it gives my skin.</li>
      <li>By far the best SKIN79 cream out there.</li>
      <li>can make my face look good and smoothly .</li>
      <li>The best effect that is noticed by every body when I wear this BB Cream is the natural Glow of the skin and the highlighted color.</li>
      <li>I found that my skin needs better coverage</li>
      <li>More than that</li>
      <li>I use the BB cream daily after cleansing and the result is impressive.</li>
      <li>I love the way it feels on my face.</li>
      <li>love it though.</li>
      <li>love the product - no colors even close to my complextion.</li>
      <li>So far a great product.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect BB cream for everyday use.</li>
      <li>This product is best for those who are in good skin condition and just need a little bit of protection against UV when going outside.</li>
      <li>Overall, I really liked it and will buy it again!</li>
      <li>The great thing about this product is its SPF 37 as well as PA+++ which is amazing sun protection compared to other sunblocks which only have SPF.</li>
      <li>but this one is more for combination to dry skin because it tends to retain more moisture.</li>
      <li>i need not even a dab to use it effectively and therfore cannot use it for coverage of the entire face as a primer.</li>
      <li>However, it provides the perfect coverage(not too think, not too bare) for everyday use.</li>
      <li>First, my face did not look nature, but cakey.</li>
      <li>I never thought it came so fast!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very high quality product</li>
      <li>I really like it!It</li>
      <li>I have tried all versions and this one is very creamy and makes the skin dewy looking.</li>
      <li>There is a pump on this foundation which makes it much easier to apply.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s now replaced all my other foundations as my favorite.</li>
      <li>The price is decent for the volume.</li>
      <li>I have tried BB creams because I think it&#x27;s a clever idea to wear makeup and skin care in one product.</li>
      <li>This also has SPF 37 which is one of the main reasons I bought it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for dry skin with excessive oil.  </li>
      <li>I have light acne discoloration and this covers it up very nicely, I usually finish off with a powder on top since sometimes it can be a little too shiny.</li>
      <li>I would say coverage is low-med, while the hot pink version has a little bit more coverage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used both this BB cream by Skin 79 and and the hot pink version as well.</li>
      <li>I really like this BB Cream, but I am still partial to the Hot Pink version.  </li>
      <li>Application of this BB cream gives you a clear finish to the skin, though may turn some people&#x27;s face into a white mask.</li>
      <li>It absolutely does not have function in covering up your dark spots/blemishes.</li>
      <li>Good BB but the undertones are off, at least for me, because they are too pink (I&#x27;m pale faced).</li>

<li> When I opened it today, it was empty.  </li>

<li> I was disappointed not to see more of a Diamond/Jewel sparkle with this version.</li>
<li> The only bad thing is that it can look slightly cakey if you apply too much.</li>

<li> this is not what i expected, it is very pale and thick and it goes on heavy.</li>
<li> The product was heavy, hard to spread, and did not match my skin color.</li>
<li> and I was not satisfied with the consistency of the product.</li>
<li> so it is hard to tell when it is time to get another bottle of the product.</li>
<li> Greasy late in the day.</li>

<li> /&gt;Might work for other but not me :(</li>
<li> I tried it on a few times, and hate it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m slightly disappointed in that it doesn&#x27;t cover my reddish tone of the face.</li>
<li> it seems so expensive!!   </li>
<li> The worst thing is: I felt itchy and began to have breakout where I never had breakout before.  </li>

    <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t use the product for a few months after I purchased since I had some already.  When I opened it today, it was empty.  I kept pumping but no luck.  Now I can&#x27;t return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both this BB cream by Skin 79 and and the hot pink version as well. They are both great products but this one is more for combination to dry skin because it tends to retain more moisture. After putting this one on, it leaves a bit of a dewy look on your skin. I would say coverage is low-med, while the hot pink version has a little bit more coverage. The great thing about this product is its SPF 37 as well as PA+++ which is amazing sun protection compared to other sunblocks which only have SPF. The price is decent for the volume. I use this almost every day and I&#x27;d say it lasts about 2.5 to 3 months.</li>
    <li> When I know about the ingredients of this BB cream, I am like Woa....it seems so expensive!!   It&#x27;s good for dry skin with excessive oil.  It makes my skin bright and resilient!  More than that, it&#x27;s SPF37 PA+++! The greatest sun protection!  I&#x27;m really addicted to this BB cream and all others I have.</li>
    <li> I really like this BB Cream, but I am still partial to the Hot Pink version.  I have medium tan skin, and this is for fair skin. No problem, I use the BB Cream as a Primer under Powder or Liquid Foundation. I use one shade darker then my skin tone because the BB Cream does lighten it.  The oil control is great, and I love the healthy glow it gives my skin. I was disappointed not to see more of a Diamond/Jewel sparkle with this version.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after did some research on this product. I tried it on a few times, and hate it. First, my face did not look nature, but cakey. The worst thing is: I felt itchy and began to have breakout where I never had breakout before.  It may work with others, but not me. I would suggest you test it before purchased it.</li>
    <li> Work great for me, love how the cap turns to lock.  So far a great product.</li>
    <li> this is not what i expected, it is very pale and thick and it goes on heavy. i need not even a dab to use it effectively and therfore cannot use it for coverage of the entire face as a primer. i ended up buying a different primer.</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels on my face. It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel like its all caked up with make-up!</li>
    <li> Almost sheer coverage. Greasy late in the day.</li>
    <li> The best effect that is noticed by every body when I wear this BB Cream is the natural Glow of the skin and the highlighted color. didnt use for too long to notice its effect on skin blemishes. I will continue using it and I do recomment using it with or without foundation.</li>
    <li> The bottle came broken and didn&#x27;t pump. This product is also thicker and oiler than the others by skin79 that I tried.</li>
    <li> By far the best SKIN79 cream out there. I have tried all versions and this one is very creamy and makes the skin dewy looking.</li>
    <li> I have tried BB creams because I think it&#x27;s a clever idea to wear makeup and skin care in one product. I found that my skin needs better coverage and I was not satisfied with the consistency of the product. The product was heavy, hard to spread, and did not match my skin color. Regardless, I won&#x27;t give up on BB creams.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect BB cream for everyday use. I have cool-toned fair/light skin. It can be a bit heavy. However, it provides the perfect coverage(not too think, not too bare) for everyday use. I&#x27;m slightly disappointed in that it doesn&#x27;t cover my reddish tone of the face. Overall, I really liked it and will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have the whitest of the white skin and even the lightest drugstore makeup tended to leave me with tan lines on my jaw. This stuff matches perfectly! And it&#x27;s so moisturizing, makes my skin glow, and makes it look like I&#x27;ve been drinking veggie smoothies all day. I have light acne discoloration and this covers it up very nicely, I usually finish off with a powder on top since sometimes it can be a little too shiny. It&#x27;s a very high quality product and it&#x27;s now replaced all my other foundations as my favorite. The extra sunscreen protection is an added bonus as well.</li>
    <li> it is great i loved it. it beats any of our cover up in the stores. i am telling all my friends and now they r changing their coverup</li>
    <li> I never thought it came so fast!  I have used this product for years.and I really like it!It can make my face look good and smoothly .</li>
    <li> Application of this BB cream gives you a clear finish to the skin, though may turn some people&#x27;s face into a white mask. This product is best for those who are in good skin condition and just need a little bit of protection against UV when going outside. It absolutely does not have function in covering up your dark spots/blemishes. Dont forget to set the BB cream with powder.&lt;br /&gt;The container is not see-through so it is hard to tell when it is time to get another bottle of the product.</li>
    <li> love the product - no colors even close to my complextion. I mix it with my makeup and apply it...so it will last me quite a while. love it though.</li>
    <li> This BB cream starts off as a grayish-Brown color but when you rub it on ton your face it begins to match your skin tone.There is a pump on this foundation which makes it much easier to apply. This BB cream has great coverage and makes your skin look flawless. This also has SPF 37 which is one of the main reasons I bought it. The only bad thing is that it can look slightly cakey if you apply too much.</li>
    <li> I use the BB cream daily after cleansing and the result is impressive. It is moisturizing, wrinkle-reducing,and  especially covering the pigmentation</li>
    <li> Good BB but the undertones are off, at least for me, because they are too pink (I&#x27;m pale faced). I usually like to buy BB&#x27;s with slightly yellow undertones to cancel out my pink/red undertones but this BB brought them out even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might work for other but not me :(</li>
