      <li>My friend and i tried it thinking that it would be a great product</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>Good item.</li>

      <li>My kids love it for their hair.</li>
      <li>It was okay.</li>
      <li>If you have never used hair chalk, keep in mind most pictures seen on the Internet are of hair that&#x27;s been dyed.</li>
      <li>It was fun doing our hair together and the end results looked good.</li>
      <li>and we love how these worked.</li>
      <li>It is also easy to wash out and didn&#x27;t bleed onto my pillowcases which is a plus.</li>
      <li>Not at all easy to apply</li>
      <li>The chalk DOES NOT apply easily onto brown hair.</li>
      <li>Yea it worked out really fine..</li>
      <li>I had so much fun with them!</li>
      <li>I understood I was in for some clean up.  </li>
      <li>I think for the price that this kit is just fine and fun.  </li>
      <li>Not too much, otherwise it&#x27;ll soften and break more easily.&lt;br /&gt;-For</li>
      <li>The only good thing I can say is that it washed right out of her clothes and hair.</li>
      <li>These are great short sticks, the color does come out quite vibrant.</li>
      <li>had no problems seeing the color, actually my main concern was getting the color off of my hands, but overall I got great results</li>
      <li>it looked pretty good overall</li>
      <li>I would buy this again just for fun or the kids.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun but not that much fun.</li>
      <li>The color transfers easily, looks vibrant and lasts until you wash it out.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the results I got with these chalks, I recommend that your hair is pretty wet and found it worked best just coloring directly on my scalp....</li>
      <li>start with the lighter color first if you&#x27;re doing a multicolor/ombre</li>
      <li>My son has dyed his hair black and it have to say the blue looks great in his hair.</li>
      <li>I have naturally super light blonde hair and it took about 3 or 4 washes before it came out completely.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like these.</li>
      <li>Trying to color all your hair with this is way too much hassle</li>
      <li>Works better if you wet the chalk not your hair as it states in the instructions.</li>
      <li>Honestly it was messy and got all over everything.</li>
      <li>This chalk provides vibrant color and it stays on all day.</li>
      <li>My 6 year old really wanted hair chalk.</li>
      <li>Chalk is smaller then what I expected but works great on my dark hair.</li>
      <li>Love it, but a bit messy!</li>
      <li>Your hair will dye easily if it&#x27;s light blonde, but not so much if it&#x27;s any other color.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply but messy.</li>
      <li>It made a huge mess</li>
      <li>Other than that, coloring is cool.</li>
      <li>I have black hair, but was hopeful that I could get some of the color to show up since others like Kandee Johnson and some Asian girls like me were able to.</li>
      <li>Wear gloves and old clothes.</li>
      <li>I have straight blonde hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;Below are some general tips that I&#x27;ve picked up from the internet:&lt;br /&gt;-Start with unconditioned hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Dampen</li>
      <li>If you want something fun that will wash out in a few days, this works.</li>
      <li>Let it air dry if possible, then use a straight iron/curling</li>
      <li>dark hair, apply white first, as it helps the desired color stand out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>you have to do much work to paint (in dark hair) but it is still working</li>
      <li>This was fun to do, it helps if you also wet the chalk as well as your hair, I have almost black hair</li>

<li> This was fun to do, it helps if you also wet the chalk as well as your hair, I have almost black hair</li>
<li> Unfortunately, even with applying white first and then layering the color on top of it, the colors didn&#x27;t show up well and/or looked dull.</li>
<li> Does not last long if you touch your hair after applying.</li>
<li> My general advice will be to be prepared to make a gigantic mess, have tinted skin for a day or two and ultimately resolve to go for a permanent hair</li>
<li> My hair wouldn&#x27;t dry even when I flat ironed it.</li>
<li> Color doesn&#x27;t stay long as I predicted though..</li>
<li> The chalk dried out, knotted, and completely wrecked both of our hair.  </li>
<li> It got all over my furniture and the tips of my hair was so dry.</li>
<li> I could not get this to go on to my hair when it was dry.</li>
<li> I used the red chalk on my dark brown hair.</li>
<li> stuff is going to get everywhere, whether it&#x27;s dry or wet.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s easy but it makes all hands dirty and everywhere it&#x27;s wet.</li>
<li> my hair had to be wet</li>
<li> it got my shirt all pink as well.</li>
<li> Hair must be wet and chalk must be wet.</li>
<li> with my hair being wet</li>
<li> -your hair must be WET to use them.</li>
<li> Lasted only a few hours!</li>
<li> Wet the chalk slightly as well, as it helps with color transfer.</li>
<li> If you have dark brown/black hair, I&#x27;d suggest sticking with colored hair extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The chalk is too hard and dry to use on even wet hair.</li>
<li> Other than that, no complaints!</li>
<li> These are like half size.</li>
<li> doesnt work for black ir brunnetes</li>
<li> Your bathroom will be a mess.</li>
<li> It gave a little darker than burgundy.</li>
<li> My daughter has very dark brown hair</li>
<li> Definitely messy like they said it would be.  </li>
<li> Leaves hair with a stiff unmanageable texture.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t come with enough of each color and difficult to get in and out</li>
<li> it makes a mess, the colors would be everywhere !!</li>
<li> It was sooooo freakin hard to put on tho.</li>
<li> It is hard to get the chalk to work.</li>
<li> It literally SUCKS ...</li>
<li> Dried my hair out like crazy</li>
<li> To get this dramatic effect, I used about 1/4 to 1/2 of each stick of those colors.</li>
<li> and the results are mediocre.</li>
<li> but we were completely wrong.  </li>
<li> what I do sorry</li>
<li> Some of the prices broke and the parts that I chalked my hair felt like fake hair.</li>
<li> Decided to order these hair chalks because I&#x27;m a guy and was skeptical about bleaching my hair</li>
<li> Oh, the chalk didn&#x27;t dye my hands to bad and dish soap took off any color that was on my skin.</li>
<li> but it don&#x27;t works :( :X</li>
<li> This hair chalk was horrible!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not work at all! I tried all of the ccolors on my hair and the color wouldnt rub off.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves them.  thank you.</li>
    <li> you have to do much work to paint (in dark hair) but it is still working</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like these. I couldn&#x27;t get the color to stay (visible) on my hair...</li>
    <li> not stay on your hair well</li>
    <li> I used the red chalk on my dark brown hair. It gave a little darker than burgundy. My son has dyed his hair black and it have to say the blue looks great in his hair. It was fun doing our hair together and the end results looked good. I would buy this again just for fun or the kids. For myself I think it would be easier to use the dye in my hair. If you want something fun that will wash out in a few days, this works. Oh, the chalk didn&#x27;t dye my hands to bad and dish soap took off any color that was on my skin.</li>
    <li> It is hard to get the chalk to work. Hair must be wet and chalk must be wet. I just bought it for fun and knew it might not be the best product so not terribly disappointed.</li>
    <li> My friend and i tried it thinking that it would be a great product but we were completely wrong.  The chalk dried out, knotted, and completely wrecked both of our hair.  It made a huge mess and I had to use loads of conditioner to fix my hair.  The chalk DOES NOT apply easily onto brown hair. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It literally SUCKS ... it makes a mess, the colors would be everywhere !! Don&#x27;t be tricked by the pictures and think that it&#x27;s a good item!</li>
    <li> Not at all easy to apply and the results are mediocre.</li>
    <li> This chalk provides vibrant color and it stays on all day. It is also easy to wash out and didn&#x27;t bleed onto my pillowcases which is a plus.</li>
    <li> These hair chalks are excellent. Couple things to keep in mind-your hair must be WET to use them. Your hair will dye easily if it&#x27;s light blonde, but not so much if it&#x27;s any other color. Wear gloves and old clothes. Your bathroom will be a mess. Whatever clothes you wear while your hair has chalk in it will get residue on it. Do not use this product then complain about the mess-it&#x27;s a given with ALL hair chalks!  I&#x27;ve included some pics of how my hair looked after using the pinks, red, and orange chalks-To get this dramatic effect, I used about 1/4 to 1/2 of each stick of those colors. I had so much fun with them!</li>
    <li> Decided to order these hair chalks because I&#x27;m a guy and was skeptical about bleaching my hair so I could color it. I was pleasantly surprised with the results I got with these chalks, I recommend that your hair is pretty wet and found it worked best just coloring directly on my scalp....had no problems seeing the color, actually my main concern was getting the color off of my hands, but overall I got great results</li>
    <li> I think for the price that this kit is just fine and fun.  I have never tried others but it seemed to work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with enough of each color and difficult to get in and out</li>
    <li> Works better if you wet the chalk not your hair as it states in the instructions.</li>
    <li> doesnt work for black ir brunnetes</li>
    <li> My 6 year old really wanted hair chalk. Honestly it was messy and got all over everything. The only good thing I can say is that it washed right out of her clothes and hair.</li>
    <li> I have black hair, but was hopeful that I could get some of the color to show up since others like Kandee Johnson and some Asian girls like me were able to. Unfortunately, even with applying white first and then layering the color on top of it, the colors didn&#x27;t show up well and/or looked dull. If you have dark brown/black hair, I&#x27;d suggest sticking with colored hair extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are some general tips that I&#x27;ve picked up from the internet:&lt;br /&gt;-Start with unconditioned hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Dampen your hair if you&#x27;re dark-haired. Wet the chalk slightly as well, as it helps with color transfer. Not too much, otherwise it&#x27;ll soften and break more easily.&lt;br /&gt;-For dark hair, apply white first, as it helps the desired color stand out.&lt;br /&gt;-Always start with the lighter color first if you&#x27;re doing a multicolor/ombre effect.&lt;br /&gt;-Seal in your chalked hair with heat! Let it air dry if possible, then use a straight iron/curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;-This stuff is going to get everywhere, whether it&#x27;s dry or wet. Wear a shirt that&#x27;s the same color as your chalked hair. Any stains can be removed with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy chalking!</li>
    <li> Dried my hair out like crazy</li>
    <li> I could not get this to go on to my hair when it was dry. I have straight blonde hair so I thought this was going to be a snap. my hair had to be wet and it went on way better. with my hair being wet it got my shirt all pink as well. it looked pretty good overall but it was kind of a process.</li>
    <li> This hair chalk was horrible!!! It got all over my furniture and the tips of my hair was so dry. My hair wouldn&#x27;t dry even when I flat ironed it. Even still, it left a lot of marks left on my furniture. This product I DO NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Definitely messy like they said it would be.  Since I read packaging meticulously  I understood I was in for some clean up.  Works well.  Don&#x27;t wear white if this is in your hair because it would stain.  I recommend this for only highlights.  Trying to color all your hair with this is way too much hassle and there&#x27;s not enough product for it.</li>
    <li> Yea it worked out really fine.. It&#x27;s easy but it makes all hands dirty and everywhere it&#x27;s wet. Other than that, coloring is cool. Color doesn&#x27;t stay long as I predicted though.. Lasted only a few hours! Then all&#x27;s gone!</li>
    <li> It was okay. It was sooooo freakin hard to put on tho. Some of the prices broke and the parts that I chalked my hair felt like fake hair.</li>
    <li> Love it, but a bit messy!</li>
    <li> they are too smaal and i have very light hair but it don&#x27;t works :( :X</li>
    <li> This was fun to do, it helps if you also wet the chalk as well as your hair, I have almost black hair and it showed up on me.</li>
    <li> I like the colors, but it stains hands, gets on your face and gets all over clothes and exposed skin. Can&#x27;t style your hair afterwards or even run fingers through hair. Leaves hair with a stiff unmanageable texture. If you have never used hair chalk, keep in mind most pictures seen on the Internet are of hair that&#x27;s been dyed. Not hair chalk!</li>
    <li> I didnt like it is doesn&#x27;t work no matter what I do sorry</li>
    <li> I loved it! The color transfers easily, looks vibrant and lasts until you wash it out. I have naturally super light blonde hair and it took about 3 or 4 washes before it came out completely. Other than that, no complaints!</li>
    <li> My daughter has very dark brown hair and we love how these worked.</li>
    <li> Good item. Chalk is smaller then what I expected but works great on my dark hair. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Very cheap quality. Does not work at all. The chalk is too hard and dry to use on even wet hair.</li>
    <li> Hair chalking was an adventure I hope never to repeat. Which is on me, not this product. These are great short sticks, the color does come out quite vibrant. I did think one application used a lot of the stick so if you plan to do this often you may want to buy the longer sticks. These are like half size. My general advice will be to be prepared to make a gigantic mess, have tinted skin for a day or two and ultimately resolve to go for a permanent hair dye lol. It&#x27;s fun but not that much fun.</li>
    <li> My kids love it for their hair. Easy to apply but messy. Does not last long if you touch your hair after applying.</li>
