### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Arrived on time and in great condition.  </li>
      <li>The handle and loofah are very nice.</li>
      <li>Good purchase-would recommend.</li>
      <li>The glue that is used to attach the loofah to the handle is some sort of rubber cement so in a warm shower it loosened up</li>
      <li>Will be looking for a better brand.</li>
      <li>This results in a ton of leverage, and no matter how strong the glue is, the loofah is sure to tear off of the handle.</li>
      <li>Which was surprising because I was fairly gentle with the product.</li>
      <li>It broke first time using it but seller was honest refunding money</li>
      <li>It was fine while it lasted.  </li>
      <li>I have another one now, and it is just fine.</li>
      <li>They will be replacing it very soon though, just for their own sanitary/hygiene preference.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift because it was eco friendly</li>
      <li>Also the sponge is not flat, so you don&#x27;t get good sponge to skin contact.</li>
      <li>Mildewed and molded quickly.</li>
      <li>This is very well made, and is easy to use  in the shower.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong but not to heavy and feels good in your hand.</li>
      <li>The sponge on this loofah looks nice enough.</li>
      <li>Loofah separated from the handle on the first use.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this, the loofa expanded to its cylindrical shape and immediately fell off.  </li>
      <li>This is a &#x27;real&#x27; loofah, seeds can come out when you first start using it.</li>
      <li>All in all, this turned out to be a really crappy purchase.</li>
      <li>This particular one was too rough on the edges and did not feel good when I would scrub my back with it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been used steady for 6 months and still working as intended.</li>
      <li>It does it&#x27;s job and is a high quality.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s on is of good size, hard to find a place to put in a small bathroom but fits on the ledge of a jacuzzi tub just fine.</li>
      <li>Oh well; live and learn.</li>
      <li>Its decent, getting old here, so gotta to keep cellulite at bay.  </li>
      <li>this is the first loofah back scrubber I have owned, but i like it.</li>
      <li>Within two weeks, the front side developed a significant black mold.</li>
      <li>Seemed gentle but quality until the sponge head fell off after the third use.</li>
      <li>Use it at the gym before and after swimming in the sauna and steam room, seems decent no fraying ends, appears to hold up well to my constant leg massaging.</li>
      <li>Barely used this when the loofah detached from the handle.</li>

    <li> Arrived on time and in great condition.  Good for using on the legs and back but awkward for other body parts.  Not as rough as loofas usually are but not a real issue as it does the job of exfoliating.  Good purchase-would recommend.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Bamboo and Loofah Bath Brush  The loofah sponge separated from the bamboo handle after about 5 showers.  Also the sponge is not flat, so you don&#x27;t get good sponge to skin contact. All in all, this turned out to be a really crappy purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift because it was eco friendly and I try to do my part to give back. This is a &#x27;real&#x27; loofah, seeds can come out when you first start using it. It&#x27;s been used steady for 6 months and still working as intended. They will be replacing it very soon though, just for their own sanitary/hygiene preference. The bamboo &#x27;stick&#x27; it&#x27;s on is of good size, hard to find a place to put in a small bathroom but fits on the ledge of a jacuzzi tub just fine.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  Seemed gentle but quality until the sponge head fell off after the third use.</li>
    <li> this is the first loofah back scrubber I have owned, but i like it. It&#x27;s strong but not to heavy and feels good in your hand. Loofah is a little rough but not hard to get used to.</li>
    <li> Barely used this when the loofah detached from the handle. So I have two items now...a loofah and a paint stirrer. Will be looking for a better brand.</li>
    <li> It was fine while it lasted.  The sponge part is flat in the pictures but eventually rounds out to the usual shape after it&#x27;s been exposed to water for a few showers.  Felt fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside was the adhesive keeping the sponge on the stick was way too weak.  Sponge separated from the stick after about 6 weeks.  Which was surprising because I was fairly gentle with the product. My less than classy solution was to cut the string off the handle, and then shove the handle through one of the holes in the sponge.  That actually works well in keeping the sponge attached, but it does result in a trashy looking shower.</li>
    <li> Loofah separated from the handle on the first use. Bought a second one, and the same thing happened.</li>
    <li> Its decent, getting old here, so gotta to keep cellulite at bay.  Use it at the gym before and after swimming in the sauna and steam room, seems decent no fraying ends, appears to hold up well to my constant leg massaging.</li>
    <li> The loofah separated from the wooden backing after just a few months.</li>
    <li> The sponge on this loofah looks nice enough. But it became detached from the wood stick within days. I used superglue to re-attach it. Within two weeks, the front side developed a significant black mold. The loofah rested with the wood to the tile in an otherwise dry bathroom. We had to chuck it.</li>
    <li> After about 6 uses the Loofah sponge separated from the handle.  I suppose you can crazy glue it back but that&#x27;s not the point.  Look elsewhere and don&#x27;t try this product.</li>
    <li> The brush separated from the handle after less than a week. This is apparently a common complaint about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance because of the price and ended up getting burned. Oh well; live and learn.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, the loofa expanded to its cylindrical shape and immediately fell off.  I just use it without the handle now</li>
    <li> The handle and loofah are very nice. It&#x27;s just to bad that it fell apart. The glue that is used to attach the loofah to the handle is some sort of rubber cement so in a warm shower it loosened up and the loofah fell off the handle in just 3 uses. I still use the loofah but it kinda defeats the purpose of getting to wash my back.</li>
    <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a loofah. It does it&#x27;s job and is a high quality.</li>
    <li> This product is designed so poorly, it is bound to fail within a few days. The loofah expands to a cylinder, and is glued to the handle on one side. This results in a ton of leverage, and no matter how strong the glue is, the loofah is sure to tear off of the handle. The manufacturer must have NEVER tested the product before selling it. Which is frustrating.</li>
    <li> This particular one was too rough on the edges and did not feel good when I would scrub my back with it. I have another one now, and it is just fine.</li>
    <li> This is very well made, and is easy to use  in the shower.  I will  definitely order another one when I need it.</li>
    <li> Mildewed and molded quickly. I threw it away.</li>
    <li> It broke first time using it but seller was honest refunding money</li>
