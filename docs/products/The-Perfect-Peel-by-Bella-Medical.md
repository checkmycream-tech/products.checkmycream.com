### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it works the way I want it to and gives great results.. and the price cant be beat!</li>
      <li>This is the best at home peel.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product after being recommended the perfect peel by a skin care specialist.  </li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve been reading about The Perfect Peel and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
      <li>He did his best to recreate the VIPeel.</li>
      <li>the best peel on the market if you want results.</li>
      <li>Great, excellent quality peel.</li>
      <li>This is a great do it yourself peel .  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done many spa grade peels, along with the VI Peel, at home with wonderful results.</li>
      <li>and I can tell you it is a very strong peel and should not be done by oneself!  </li>
      <li>I had it done in a doctors office before and was a bit nervous to do it on my own.</li>
      <li>its the most amazing thing ever when you see the results.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>YES I would by this product on AMAZON again :-)</li>
      <li>Great peel nd fast delievery</li>
      <li>was satisfied with this peel.</li>
      <li>Wow I really loved this peel!</li>
      <li>I love the Perfect Peel, you will find any discoloration of the skin will begin to fade following the first use.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you read all the directions and clean your skin well before using.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply with down time of about 5 days; allowing a full 10 days for the best to come through and leave you with a fresh healthy glow that lasts 6 months for sure.</li>
      <li>I mean the consistancy isnt the same and the stinging of the chemical is a lot more intense but managable compared to going to the dermatologists office and paying $300+ to get the perfect peel - the dermo office perfect peel is more like a honey consistency and the numbing agent in the product is a higher grade which makes the peel more comfortable.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Advanced skin care would not return my product.</li>
      <li>You can use either acetone or alcohol keep cleaning until cotton is clean.  </li>
      <li>and I loved it I had before several others but including the Vipeel</li>
      <li>Had noticeable peeling for a full 6 days.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why the booster was additional if it is included in this kit and is the same strength and size as applied in my doctor&#x27;s office, although I am very glad to have experienced the first one in a medical setting.  </li>
      <li>I actually did my last peel over Halloween and made a perfect zombie</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the results so far.  </li>
      <li>its worth the price and downtime.</li>
      <li>I am also a former employee -- but I still get VIPeels :)</li>
      <li>The first night stung.  </li>
      <li>I have paid a lot of money for professional peels and this peel is amazing and gives professional results at a much cheaper price.</li>
      <li>The first time was great I peeled , second time not much at all</li>
      <li>I am certainly looking at this.  </li>
      <li>If this is the real deal, it is for use in a office associated with a MD.  </li>
      <li>This is the real deal</li>
      <li>so I was ready, but it still startled me.  </li>
      <li>Made my skin very dewy and lightened my skin.</li>
      <li>No the real product.</li>
      <li>Fresh skin was radiant and clear.</li>
      <li>and i have suffered from acne my whole life.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately for him, and for you as someone interested in the product, the VIPeel formula is a family secret and as a result the Perfect Peel is missing crucial ingredients that make the VIPeel the safest and most effective peel on the market.</li>
      <li>It clearly is stated on the bottle, again if it is the real thing.  </li>
      <li>This was more painful and caused more redness.  </li>
      <li>I then had the procedure done professionally</li>
      <li>/&gt;Im 25 years old</li>
      <li>One of the ingredients in the real peel in Phenol, which care lead to medical problems</li>
      <li>The product really works I could actually see results.</li>
      <li>My face took 10 days to peel and it considerably improved the texture of the skin, along with completely removing some of the spots while lightening others.  </li>
      <li>My face was quite sensitive for the first 36 hours, don&#x27;t recall this extreme sensitivity with the VI Peel.</li>
      <li>So far the results are mixed.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely do it again and the price was at least half or more of what doctors offices charge!</li>
      <li>I had never had a peel before and did not know that this peel can only be purchased by a Dr. and is only to be administered in the office of a professional.  </li>
      <li>Do not buy this product, a medical grade chemical peel has to be administered by a medical professional.</li>

<li> I usually peel for about a week</li>

<li> I was very red, like a bad sunburn.  </li>
<li> a little cheaper price went up like 20 some dollars :(</li>
<li> It is illegal to sell this to the end user.</li>
<li> Amazon, have some integrity and please remove this illegal listing!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think I will use this again, too painful with disappointing results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is an scam, they are seeling samples not for resale. No the real product.</li>
    <li> This is a great do it yourself peel .  Make sure you read all the directions and clean your skin well before using. You can use either acetone or alcohol keep cleaning until cotton is clean.  And don&#x27;t make any plans for day 3-6 you will peel.  I actually did my last peel over Halloween and made a perfect zombie :)  I have done this peel 3 times and will do it again in February</li>
    <li> The first time was great I peeled , second time not much at all</li>
    <li> I found this peel after having a VI Peel at a dermatologist&#x27;s office.  This was more painful and caused more redness.  I applied on a Wed., and worked on Thursday.  I was very red, like a bad sunburn.  Had several questions on what had happened to me.  Had noticeable peeling for a full 6 days.  The biggest problem I had was a scabbing that formed over one of the dark age spots I was trying to get rid of.  The scabbing is finally going away after 5+ weeks with the use of hydrocortisone.  The dark spots are still here.  My pores do look smaller and acne is cleared up.  I don&#x27;t think I will use this again, too painful with disappointing results.</li>
    <li> Peel is Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im 25 years old and i have suffered from acne my whole life. Ive tried everything under the sun and nothing has ever worked. This peel does the trick. its worth the price and downtime. I usually peel for about a week and i literally peel off layers of my skin, its the most amazing thing ever when you see the results.</li>
    <li> If this is the real deal, it is for use in a office associated with a MD.  It clearly is stated on the bottle, again if it is the real thing.  Beware.  One of the ingredients in the real peel in Phenol, which care lead to medical problems</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars -- this product is NOT the same as if you were to get it done at the dermatologist.. now by that I mean the consistancy isnt the same and the stinging of the chemical is a lot more intense but managable compared to going to the dermatologists office and paying $300+ to get the perfect peel - the dermo office perfect peel is more like a honey consistency and the numbing agent in the product is a higher grade which makes the peel more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;*** Overall YES I would by this product on AMAZON again :-) it works the way I want it to and gives great results.. and the price cant be beat! ***</li>
    <li> The owner of Bella Medical, a former tile worker, was an employee (not a scientist/doctor) of VIPeel but his relationship ended when he was found to be stealing funds from the company. He did his best to recreate the VIPeel. Unfortunately for him, and for you as someone interested in the product, the VIPeel formula is a family secret and as a result the Perfect Peel is missing crucial ingredients that make the VIPeel the safest and most effective peel on the market. Would you buy an incomplete skin care product from a handyman? I don&#x27;t think so. source: I am also a former employee -- but I still get VIPeels :)</li>
    <li> I had this peel applied in my derm&#x27;s office 2 weeks ago, with a booster on hyperpigmentation spots.  I actually had three peels applied at the same time to different parts of my body, including face, arms and legs.  I am pleased with the results so far.  My face took 10 days to peel and it considerably improved the texture of the skin, along with completely removing some of the spots while lightening others.  My arms and legs are still in peeling process since they peel at a different rate than facial areas.  I am seeing the same results happen as with my face.  I totally believe the booster is the key for the hyperpigmentation spots.  Since I paid $250.00 for the peel and $50.00 for the booster for each one ($900.00 total) I am certainly looking at this.  I don&#x27;t understand why the booster was additional if it is included in this kit and is the same strength and size as applied in my doctor&#x27;s office, although I am very glad to have experienced the first one in a medical setting.  I am considering purchasing this to do at home if needed again.</li>
    <li> Great, excellent quality peel. Fresh skin was radiant and clear.</li>
    <li> I bought this Product and I loved it I had before several others but including the Vipeel but nothing like this one.I recommend it and I will do it again!!!! I bought this a little cheaper price went up like 20 some dollars :(</li>
    <li> The product really works I could actually see results.</li>
    <li> This is the best at home peel. Made my skin very dewy and lightened my skin. Will do again in another month.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after being recommended the perfect peel by a skin care specialist.  I had never had a peel before and did not know that this peel can only be purchased by a Dr. and is only to be administered in the office of a professional.  When I received the package it appeared to be only a sample size and stated &amp;#34;not for resale&amp;#34; on the bottle.  Because it is a sample size the savings they say you are receiving is inaccurate.  I then had the procedure done professionally and I can tell you it is a very strong peel and should not be done by oneself!  It can lead to scaring if you don&#x27;t follow all the instructions.  Not all of them are on the instruction sheet given.  I would not recommend buying this product.  I&#x27;m not sure how they can get away with selling something that is by prescription only. Advanced skin care would not return my product.</li>
    <li> This is a medical grade product! It is illegal to sell this to the end user. It is like selling prescription drugs without a prescription. Do not buy this product, a medical grade chemical peel has to be administered by a medical professional. You could severely burn your skin trying to do this at home. Amazon, have some integrity and please remove this illegal listing! CONTAINS TCA and Retinoic Acid - prescription!</li>
    <li> Half the price then going to a aesthetic spa. Actually 1.5 times cheaper!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done many spa grade peels, along with the VI Peel, at home with wonderful results. However, I&#x27;ve been reading about The Perfect Peel and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I read and watched videos on application and felt prepared. The peel sat in the box undisturbed. When I took the metal seal off the brown bottle of acid, the white second seal popped into the air splashing a faint mist of the solution! I was about 12\\&quot; away and believe I closed my eyes in time but still felt a slight mist on my eyelids. I immediately washed my eye out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I was satisfied with this peel. My face was quite sensitive for the first 36 hours, don&#x27;t recall this extreme sensitivity with the VI Peel. Within 4 days my skin was finished peeling. Keep applying Aquaphor to the skin every few hours as this will hasten sloughing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this peel and it is $50 less expensive than the VI Peel. Just remember to watch for possible lid popping.</li>
    <li> interesting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently doing this peel through a Plastic Surgeons office with their estitcian.  The first night stung.  You definitely need the downtime.  So far the results are mixed.  I&#x27;m only on day 5 though, so we will see when it is all over.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal</li>
    <li> My assistant ordered this for herself.  I don&#x27;t know anything about it.  ps. fired assistant</li>
    <li> Worked just as well as the vi peel..impressed with the efficacy..thumbs up</li>
    <li> the best peel on the market if you want results.</li>
    <li> looooove it. don&#x27;t wait another minute.</li>
    <li> I love the Perfect Peel, you will find any discoloration of the skin will begin to fade following the first use.  Follow the directions, watch a YouTube video, wear gloves and open away from your face. If you have never had a medical grade peel be advised that your skin will literally peel off.</li>
    <li> Great peel nd fast delievery</li>
    <li> Wow I really loved this peel! I had it done in a doctors office before and was a bit nervous to do it on my own. I watched videos and read reviews and that made it easier. My only advice would be to be careful when opening the peel because it can pop open and splash a little out, possibly getting in your eye or skin. I had read that on a review so I was ready, but it still startled me.  Now my friends want me to help them do the peel.  I will definitely do it again and the price was at least half or more of what doctors offices charge!</li>
    <li> Nor a burning peel; but a healing peel that brings out the health of the skin. Easy to apply with down time of about 5 days; allowing a full 10 days for the best to come through and leave you with a fresh healthy glow that lasts 6 months for sure.</li>
    <li> I have paid a lot of money for professional peels and this peel is amazing and gives professional results at a much cheaper price. I will definitely purchase these again!</li>
