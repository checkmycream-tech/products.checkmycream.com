      <li>I love how well it holds.  </li>
      <li>Glad I can get these through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love gelish and love getting them from Amazon even more.  </li>
      <li>Its more of a blushed skin tone color.</li>
      <li>love that I can get what I want when I want it.</li>
      <li>Gelish is a great brand and works really well</li>
      <li>I have tried many gel nail polishes.</li>
      <li>Love the variety of colors Gelish carries.  </li>
      <li>but it is for sure lighter than what is depicted.</li>
      <li>My nail tech will love.</li>
      <li>This is a gorgeous color, however, I don&#x27;t know if it is the nail polish or the formula, but the first time I ordered this product it arrived with the brush all messed up</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of gelish, and i REALLY love this color.</li>
      <li>I love it with Vegas Nights for some not too in your face sparkle that you can enjoy close up but that doesn&#x27;t broadcast across the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It took me a couple of days before I began to like it, but it really grew on me and I really loved it.</li>
      <li>I was excited to have a lighter more conservative shade to add to my collection.  </li>
      <li>It is a lovely color and the picture is fairly true to color.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
      <li>Went on smooth and easy.</li>
      <li>Not too bright not too soft...</li>
      <li>Just the right pink perfect color for all the pool and beach parties</li>
      <li>Like many reviewers on this site and on other nail sites, I experienced the color fading.</li>
      <li>and i was able to just peel off the nail polish on the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Easy to order shipped right to my door...</li>
      <li>For a great pink I suggest Sugar and Spice also by Gelish</li>
      <li>It continued to fade the full two weeks</li>
      <li>Love this color, it doesn&#x27;t really look like the color pictured</li>
      <li>The color is best described as old pepto bismol as it is pepto pink with a chalkiness to it.  </li>
      <li>No other Gelish I own does this except for Go Girl.  </li>
      <li>I love the color and it worked great last summer, but when I went to use it last week</li>
      <li>The polish is fine, but the color pictured is way more vibrant/bright than the actual polish.  </li>
      <li>, it was somewhere in between bubble gum, baby pink and pepto bismol, but in a good way; softer.</li>
      <li>Is&lt;br /&gt;cheaper than CND Polish, so you may feel it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>I will say though, that at this point I would not have realized it was changing if I didn&#x27;t have the freshly applied color to see side by side.</li>
      <li>Just right.</li>
      <li>In general, I love Gelish products.  </li>
      <li>Go Girl is a great summer or spring color for everyday use!</li>
      <li>The color is still really pretty</li>
      <li>First of all, this color first out of the bottle on my nails looks just like Pepto Bismol.</li>
      <li>By a week or two it may be more obvious.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a color more similar to Go Girl, I would try \\&quot;It&#x27;s a Lily.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>You can find pictures of many Gelish colors on actual users fingernails on The Purse Forum under Nail Care / Gelish</li>
      <li>I like the gel polish by this line but this color isn&#x27;t really pretty.</li>
      <li>I had used a jewel accent on my ring fingers, and so had a couple extra coats of the top coat on it.</li>
      <li>so I can grow them out much easier than before.  </li>
      <li>It is very bubble gumish with a hint of lilac undertone.</li>
      <li>describe this as a pepto bismol pink to give you a reference most can relate to.</li>
      <li>I really do</li>
      <li>Aside from the fact that this color isn&#x27;t on of my faves, Gelish nail polish overall is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Kind of messy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel polish at home for a few years now.  </li>
      <li>Pink - i think this description is very true.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a pretty color, but I feel like it&#x27;s the only color I have that peels as easily as it does.</li>
      <li>Other sites mentioning this Go Girl color fade talk about how much it fades on vacation (presumably out in strong sunlight), but I&#x27;m here to tell you it fades without sun too.</li>
      <li>like I said if the vendor has this product defective or that just the formula for this particular color.</li>
      <li>This is a cute soft bubble gum pink.</li>
      <li>Which is really too bad since it was the first light pink I&#x27;ve ever really loved on my hands!  </li>
      <li>so I decided to take a chance that it would be a light neutral pink</li>
      <li>But no, I did not have any other light pinks.</li>
      <li>They asked me for a picture of the product and they send me a new product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It is a bubble gum pink, very similar to Essie&#x27;s Lovie Dovie, which I love also, but wanted a gel color for longer wear.</li>
      <li>And delivered earlier than expected :)</li>
      <li>I actually didn&#x27;t mind the color as I love all shades of pink and the majority of my gelish colors are brighter and darker colors.  </li>
      <li>prepped the nail beds again, cleaning and buffing and reapplied all bases, polishes, and top coats curing for the same amount of time as i do with other polishes</li>
      <li>This color is much less pink in person and is more of a lighter girly pink than the bright pink that it appears.  </li>
      <li>Although the color IS a very pretty bubble gum or pepto bismal pink, it is NOT like the color pictured.</li>
      <li>Had 2 nails completely peel off...in one piece.  </li>
      <li>it was completely lumpy and the brush has melted.  </li>
      <li>I could see this color on young teens, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>I completely stopped going to the salon for nail extensions now.  </li>
      <li>Those fingers, because they had been cured under the LED light more times faded much worse than the other fingers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great color......great price. Easy to order shipped right to my door...love that I can get what I want when I want it.</li>
    <li> Quality wise, I like this better than Shellac, I find it lasts longer and looks prettier with less visible wear. Although the color IS a very pretty bubble gum or pepto bismal pink, it is NOT like the color pictured.</li>
    <li> The last review is spot on about the color. It looks just like pepto bismol pink. Chalky baby pink. The worst part about this polish is that it will FADE over time.  It does not fade evenly either.  The overall color will lighten over the course of one week and after that you&#x27;ll notice blotchy areas.  I would google search images of Go Girl, and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.  No other Gelish I own does this except for Go Girl.  If you&#x27;re looking for a color more similar to Go Girl, I would try \\&quot;It&#x27;s a Lily.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This color is not what is pictured. Its more of a blushed skin tone color. I bought this product expecting a solid pink color but it is for sure lighter than what is depicted. It also peeled off in about three days, I typically like Gelish polish colors but I was disappointed with this one.</li>
    <li> I love the color and it worked great last summer, but when I went to use it last week it was completely lumpy and the brush has melted.  There is a life expectancy on the side of the bottle that&#x27;s says it should last for 3 years once it&#x27;s been opened.  I got less the 14 months.</li>
    <li> Like many reviewers on this site and on other nail sites, I experienced the color fading. I put on the color Monday night and loved it, it was somewhere in between bubble gum, baby pink and pepto bismol, but in a good way; softer. However, I was a little careless applying it and one finished finger had a bit of an edge which I then proceeded to peel off while watching TV. It took me until this morning (two days and a night later) to find the time to reapply to that one finger, and after I applied it the color was so different I thought I must have grabbed the wrong bottle. But no, I did not have any other light pinks. Still -it was noticeable. The new finger was the original pink, while the other 9 fingers (2 1/2 days old) had started migrating in the direction of peach. It is the dead of winter here so my hands have not been exposed to virtually any sunlight, only indoor flourescent lights.  Other sites mentioning this Go Girl color fade talk about how much it fades on vacation (presumably out in strong sunlight), but I&#x27;m here to tell you it fades without sun too. Which is really too bad since it was the first light pink I&#x27;ve ever really loved on my hands!  I will say though, that at this point I would not have realized it was changing if I didn&#x27;t have the freshly applied color to see side by side. By a week or two it may be more obvious.</li>
    <li> Wish i would have read the reviews before choosing this color. It is very bubble gumish with a hint of lilac undertone. It also has a very flat look to it. I put it on and hated it ...so redid in Tutti Fruitti immediately. Much better ! I could see this color on young teens, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, great quality, holds up well!</li>
    <li> This is a cute soft bubble gum pink. It looks great on my step daughter. When I wear it I put Water Field or June Bride over it to give it a little kick.</li>
    <li> In general, I love Gelish products.  This color is much less pink in person and is more of a lighter girly pink than the bright pink that it appears.  Polish lasts forever and does not chip.  I recommend googling images of colors before purchasing to see what it will actually look like.  Often the colors are not quite like what the swatches appear online.</li>
    <li> I love the gelish polish line...and just ordered this color to add to my collection. Go Girl is a great summer or spring color for everyday use!</li>
    <li> I got this for m-i-l as gift and she was thrilled. It is a lovely color and the picture is fairly true to color.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d describe this as a pepto bismol pink to give you a reference most can relate to. You can find pictures of many Gelish colors on actual users fingernails on The Purse Forum under Nail Care / Gelish threads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a creme color that provides 2 coat opaqueness and the typical Gelish 21 day no chip performance. Looks great with any of the sparkle colors layered on top too! I love it with Vegas Nights for some not too in your face sparkle that you can enjoy close up but that doesn&#x27;t broadcast across the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is ok I will probably go back to the nail salon though because it only holds up for a few days</li>
    <li> Got lots of compliments. Not too bright not too soft... Just right. Great size. Great for any occasion. And delivered earlier than expected :)</li>
    <li> Love it! Just the right pink perfect color for all the pool and beach parties you&#x27;ll be attending this summer.</li>
    <li> I have tried many gel nail polishes. This one fades within hours. The next day the color is completely washed out. There must be something wrong with this particular color since fading has not occurred with other colors. I emailed the mfg but have yet to hear back.  I am disappointed for paying so much for something that cannot be used.  I think I will be switching brands if they don&#x27;t follow up with me.</li>
    <li> Love this color and it is the best gel polish.  Glad I can get these through Amazon.  My nail tech will love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel polish at home for a few years now.  I completely stopped going to the salon for nail extensions now.  The gel polish is very good at thickening my nails so I can grow them out much easier than before.  I love how well it holds.  I can go two weeks in between manicures and this polish doesn&#x27;t chip or peel.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This polish dries like plastic</li>
    <li> Gelish is a great brand and works really well BEST gel nail polish ever!!!!!😘 I love it !!!!! I really do</li>
    <li> Would have given this product 5 stars, but as mentioned by other reviewers the color does change to a peachy pink color within a week. Gelish polishes are great nevertheless, great staying power with incomparible high shine.</li>
    <li> The color is best described as old pepto bismol as it is pepto pink with a chalkiness to it.  I actually didn&#x27;t mind the color as I love all shades of pink and the majority of my gelish colors are brighter and darker colors.  I was excited to have a lighter more conservative shade to add to my collection.  I applied the color as I have been with the others and it immediately started lifting and i was able to just peel off the nail polish on the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prepped the nail beds again, cleaning and buffing and reapplied all bases, polishes, and top coats curing for the same amount of time as i do with other polishes and it still gave me the same lifting and peeling result.  I finally gave up and used a different color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what i did wrong here since none of the other 9 Gelish colors I have acted like this.  I am willing to try again in a month or so but am highly disappointed that this particular color acted more like a Lee Press On Nail then as a gel color that would stay for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this item.  The color is not really as shown in the image, it is definitely Pepto pink.  I did put a coat of glitter over it hoping to avoid the fade to peachy pink.  Had 2 nails completely peel off...in one piece.  Have never had that with any other Gelish color.  I would not recommend this particular item unless you only want the color for a few days, and are seeking a pepto chalky pink.</li>
    <li> I do like this color because it is a very cheerful shade of pink, but I have to agree it fades in patches to a pale orange after about a week. However, if you look from a distance (2 feet), it&#x27;s not very noticeable. By then you will want to change the color anyway.</li>
    <li> Love this color, it doesn&#x27;t really look like the color pictured it is actually very pale pink almost like a cotton candy I would say. I put gelish vegas nights over top and it looks awesome!</li>
    <li> Pretty pink color. I read somewhere in a description, someone said it&#x27;s like Breast Cancer Pink - i think this description is very true.  Went on smooth and easy.</li>
    <li> This rating reflects my opinion on the color. I agree with another reviewer who called this a pepto bismol pink. The swatches of this color online are so varied so I decided to take a chance that it would be a light neutral pink but it is not. It&#x27;s a really &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; looking pink that frankly, I can&#x27;t wait to change. I also needed 4 coats to even out the streakiness and make it look opaque all over. Aside from the fact that this color isn&#x27;t on of my faves, Gelish nail polish overall is fantastic.</li>
    <li> The polish is fine, but the color pictured is way more vibrant/bright than the actual polish.  It is a bit thick too.</li>
    <li> I love gelish and love getting them from Amazon even more.  They are cheaper and a lot larger from amazon than buying from Sallys. This color is the same pink as pepto bismo.  So if that is the pink you want this will deliver</li>
    <li> I like the gel polish by this line but this color isn&#x27;t really pretty. Its a dull pink and doesn&#x27;t give off what I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors Gelish carries.  Don&#x27;t like the consistency of the polish....&lt;br /&gt;too runny.  Kind of messy.  CND polish is  thicker, and for me, easier to apply.  Is&lt;br /&gt;cheaper than CND Polish, so you may feel it is worth it.  Also, put on 3 coats of polish,&lt;br /&gt;instead of 2, because it is runny and not as thick.  Lasted the 2 weeks, so that was good.</li>
    <li> Nice color! Applied very smooth.Is the perfect compliment to my nails. packaged nice. Don&#x27;t know what more I can say about polish.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of gelish, and i REALLY love this color. Very pink and girly. However like other users have said, it does look like the color has faded just a bit (I applied mine two days ago). I do go tanning so i&#x27;m not sure if thats the reason why, or it is because of handwashing. The color is still really pretty and I will still continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous color, however, I don&#x27;t know if it is the nail polish or the formula, but the first time I ordered this product it arrived with the brush all messed up , it look like my dog chew it and also the formula was all grainy.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted customer service and they were good. They asked me for a picture of the product and they send me a new product.&lt;br /&gt;This time the brush was great but the product was all grainy AGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;The color was so beautiful that I decide to use it anyways and it was extremely hard to get a smooth application. I don&#x27;t know like I said if the vendor has this product defective or that just the formula for this particular color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a pretty color, but I feel like it&#x27;s the only color I have that peels as easily as it does.</li>
    <li> This colour is a bit paler than I had hoped for.  For a great pink I suggest Sugar and Spice also by Gelish</li>
    <li> First of all, this color first out of the bottle on my nails looks just like Pepto Bismol. It took me a couple of days before I began to like it, but it really grew on me and I really loved it. But, after about five days, it seemed like the color started to fade. It continued to fade the full two weeks I wore it. I thought maybe it had faded because I had used Amlactin as hand cream, so I tried it again without using Amlactin this time. Again, after a few days, it started to fade. I had used a jewel accent on my ring fingers, and so had a couple extra coats of the top coat on it. Those fingers, because they had been cured under the LED light more times faded much worse than the other fingers. I would say it only fades because of over-curing (even though I have read you can&#x27;t over-cure Harmony Gelish products), but I was really careful the 2nd time and the results were the same. I applied three coats being very careful to apply it evenly thinking maybe that was part of the problem, but apparently not. I actually loved the color it faded to, but it didn&#x27;t fade evenly so it looked bad. The color faded close to the Light Elegant color (which is a gorgeous color). Bummer! Maybe I just had a bad bottle. I have not had this problem with any of the other colors I have used.</li>
    <li> I like Gelish products a lot. The gelish products they sell on amazon are no different than what you would buy at sally&#x27;s or any other warehouse type store you would buy product at.</li>
    <li> I love the color, it was just what I was looking for! It is a bubble gum pink, very similar to Essie&#x27;s Lovie Dovie, which I love also, but wanted a gel color for longer wear.</li>
    <li> Pepto Bismol? No. It&#x27;s not as pink as it appears in the photo. It&#x27;s also streaky and nasty!! Regret this purchase.</li>
