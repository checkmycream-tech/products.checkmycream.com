      <li>AWESOME product!  </li>
      <li>Thus, making me think it&#x27;s awesome detergent that is really making the difference.</li>
      <li>I immediately stopped using it before I can see can kind of whitening.  </li>
      <li>On it&#x27;s own, it works pretty good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy about this, in fact I&#x27;m ready to order another one.</li>
      <li>It was okay</li>
      <li>I love this, my armpits are way lighter than before.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>it worked okay</li>
      <li>Within 2 days of using it, I noticed a SIGNIFICANT lightening of my underarms!  </li>
      <li>make sure you moisturize this skin area nightly, make sure you are using the right razors and shaving in the right direction, make sure your are waxing correctly, etc.</li>
      <li>but it makes your armpit smooth.</li>
      <li>Smells great works very well, my new daily regimen</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend taking further action on your own in addition to using this.....</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Fast shipping .</li>
      <li>i guess thats the main reason</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work but take a little longer since my elbow and knees rub up against clothes and things when my underarms are always shielded with this product.</li>
      <li>Overall, worth it.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>It completely surprised me and exceed my expectations!  </li>
      <li>I like that the smell is not too strong, but it works slow for me.</li>

    <li> This deodorant did not help with odor and I&#x27;m not a very sweaty or smelly person. I immediately stopped using it before I can see can kind of whitening.  It was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend taking further action on your own in addition to using this.....make sure you moisturize this skin area nightly, make sure you are using the right razors and shaving in the right direction, make sure your are waxing correctly, etc. On it&#x27;s own, it works pretty good but I didn&#x27;t see any drastic changes until I took extra steps. Overall, worth it. (PS: you must have patience with things like this! if you want overnight results, see your dermatologist.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it a one for the packaging! Lol.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, the product didn&#x27;t work for me but it makes your armpit smooth.</li>
    <li> it works and it does makes your armpit lighter for few weeks however u will feel like your armpit always feels sore all the time.&lt;br /&gt;when i tried to research it why i always get that soreness it says that it could be my deodorant and this deodorant like the other brands comes with the ingredients that cause risk of breast cancer! i stopped using it and never had any problem with my armpit. i guess thats the main reason why.&lt;br /&gt;I rather have darker armpit than risking having breast cancer.</li>
    <li> AWESOME product!  I had a problem with darkened underarms.  (Notice I said HAD!)  I ordered this product just a few days ago.  Within 2 days of using it, I noticed a SIGNIFICANT lightening of my underarms!  The results are beyond what I expected when I ordered it!  It completely surprised me and exceed my expectations!  WOW!</li>
    <li> Try already two bottles but no see any change</li>
    <li> I got the bottle leaking, I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me!!!!</li>
    <li> I received the package but its almost empty. The bottle has sign of leak. I was expecting it to be sealed or in a box at least bur it was not especially iits for personal use.</li>
    <li> I used protege LUMINATE which is 3x the price $35 for a month, with no luck! I used this and the whitening soap &amp;#34;likas&amp;#34; and have gotten results in 1 week. Now.... My underarms are the color of the rest of my skin but my elbows and knees still need some work. Thus, making me think it&#x27;s awesome detergent that is really making the difference. I&#x27;m thinking of putting the detergent on these other areas. I&#x27;m sure it would work but take a little longer since my elbow and knees rub up against clothes and things when my underarms are always shielded with this product.</li>
    <li> I like that the smell is not too strong, but it works slow for me. I almost finish the bottle, and I only see a little change. Though, I will keep using it, and hoping my underarm will get lighter and same color as my skin tone.</li>
    <li> It was okay I mean it was pretty weird when I got it like when I tried to roll it, it would like not move but it worked okay like it made it white when I had it on but it would still be black</li>
    <li> I know that 7 days is kind of impossible but its still works though! And i can see the result in 2 weeks. Belo products are amaz</li>
    <li> I love this, my armpits are way lighter than before. I use it twice aday morning n night.  :)</li>
    <li> Fast shipping . I love it. I&#x27;ll ordered it again. Thanks</li>
    <li> No difference in skin has been noticed by my daughter for whom this was for.  She is using this with a bar of whitening soap.</li>
    <li> Smells great works very well, my new daily regimen</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to see results.  I&#x27;m happy about this, in fact I&#x27;m ready to order another one.</li>
