    <li> I was using for many years the serum Botox hidroderm for 10 years, but this cream not work the same in my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hydroderm serum and moisturizer for about 12 years.  People tell me I look like I am in my 40s but I am 65!The instructions say to use twice a day, but I only use once a day.  Think what people would say if I used it twice a day!!</li>
    <li> I Love this moisturizer, it has replaced all others.  I wear it night and day!!</li>
    <li> A great moisturizer and non allergenic!</li>
    <li> Does not feel oily or greasy. Skin stayed moisturized, no flaking or cracking.  Thought it was a bit pricey for the amount of product in the jar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Hydroderm off and on for over ten years. Both the original and the one with the blue label. It is the best skin treatment I&#x27;ve found. It makes my skin hydrated and tight, quite beautiful actually. My skin responds to it extremely well. Reading reviews, perhaps it depends on skin type. I don&#x27;t know. But I find it the very best. Certainly I recommend you try a bottle.</li>
    <li> Nice feel and very moisturizing. Fast shipping. Thanks!</li>

    <li> Love it small amount goes on so smooth.</li>
    <li> works wonders on my skin</li>
    <li> I am still waiting to see if there is a difference...</li>
    <li> Not any different than other moisturizers...nothing special</li>
    <li> I will have to buy another bottle to give it a true test but so far I like the feel and texture of the product, although I can&#x27;t see any improvement yet.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer because it is non greasy.  I has received several compliments and I feel this moisturizer is the reason along with the snail firming jar.  I&#x27;m not getting any younger but if something helps me look good and feel good.  I am going to stick with it!!</li>
    <li> it was dried out, not soft and creamy like I&#x27;ve had in the past years,very disappointing&lt;br /&gt;Darsplace1@hotmail.com</li>
