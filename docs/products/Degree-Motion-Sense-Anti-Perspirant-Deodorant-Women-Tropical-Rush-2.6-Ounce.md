### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I must say that this tropical rush scent is wonderful!</li>
      <li>fragrance is just wonderful.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Wonderful if all you care about is the anti-perspirant, but not the greatest deodorant.</li>
      <li>This product was wonderful.</li>
      <li>, I think this is a very good deodorant and anti-perspirant but would be happier with it if it didn&#x27;t make overblown claims about its effectiveness.</li>
      <li>The Degree Motion Sense works great for me.</li>
      <li>It has a tropical smell which would be great for the summer and being out at the beach.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>, however, it does a good job of preventing odor and sweat from messing with your day.  </li>
      <li>It feels good going on, and it doesn&#x27;t fade away before the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I used to use speedstick, and that was amazing</li>
      <li>It is a nice island scent, to me it smells like a mixture of pineapple and coconut.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a nice treat in the morning.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice anti-perspirant offered by Degree.  </li>
      <li>- it smells nice and is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>This is a really effective deodorant &amp; anti-antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>I really liked about Degree Motion</li>
      <li>Effective on both sweat and stink prevention, even with hairy winter</li>
      <li>It was effective for over 24 hours - I never got to 48 hours</li>
      <li>The scent is light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>The smell is fresh and great.</li>
      <li>(I love sharing that kind of stuff...)</li>
      <li>The more you move, the more it protects.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>add more protection the more you move.  </li>
      <li>I love the Degree motion sense antiperspirant and deodorant.</li>
      <li>My wife used this quite a bit and was satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>I love how it controls odor all day.</li>
      <li>I have never used this brand of deodorant before, but I fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>I used it both with unshaved and shaved armpits &amp; it worked better on</li>
      <li>However, it somehow doesn&#x27;t seem to apply onto the underarms as smoothly as most deodorants.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>thought the smell was okay</li>
      <li>She wasn&#x27;t in love with it, but she said she would use it if it was around.  </li>
      <li>I highly, highly recommend this for those of you ladies that just can&#x27;t find a deodorant that keeps you feeling great all day.</li>
      <li>This works fine as an antiperspirant, and it goes on easily and feels good, but I find the aroma too much like some kind of tropical candy, with an undercurrent of coconut, to want it on my armpits.</li>
      <li>Goes on easy and washes off okay.</li>
      <li>I loved the Tropical Rush scent - my family not so much.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t sweat easily</li>
      <li>I have had no skin irritation from it, and my skin tends to get irritated easily.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be too strong</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really strong and like a slap in the face.</li>
      <li>yes, the smell is fairly strong, and I found the smell stronger than I am comfortable with, but it worked fine.</li>
      <li>This stuff works fine from being applied the day before.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tested the 48-hour claim on the tube (I am only so brave), but I don&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
      <li>I swtiched from spray to roll-ons decades ago and this goes on smoothly without staining my clothes.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with it getting on my shirts.</li>
      <li>But I just can&#x27;t get over the super strong scent.</li>
      <li>I feel pretty confident with this deodorant anti-perspirant and would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
      <li>Tropical Rush sounded fun, but I thought the scent of this deodorant was overly strong and too chemical for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant enough, and it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
      <li>The scent was sweet, but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>good solid deodorant that worked for me as an antiperspirant too.</li>
      <li>Okay, I can buy that a deodorant/anti-perspirant could react to moisture or heat, but really, this deodorant claims to know when I&#x27;m moving?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In fair warning I&#x27;m not big on scented products.  </li>
      <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and goes away pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>This deodorant, although adequate is not one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>Overall my wife has been really happy with the product and really likes the products offered by Degree as the always seem to do what they are supposed to do.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While the scent did fade fairly quickly it did have a mild lingering</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the Degree formula and plan to continue using it.</li>
      <li>far I&#x27;ve been satisfied with Degree Motion Sense performance.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good about it.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance wears well all day and stays fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>The smell is also just right and not too overpowering.  </li>
      <li>It does a pretty good jod of covering odors and blocking sweat unless you get to active.  </li>
      <li>Now, if it were a drink with a little umbrella stuck into a slice of pineapple, the scent would be more appealing.  </li>
      <li>This stuff works great and has a lovely coconut smell, rather than fake tropical flower stench.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the fruity, tropical scent this has, but it seems to be little more than a perfume to cover up rather than a true deodorant.  </li>
      <li>This works well - I don&#x27;t use it for workouts or such but more for an every day use.</li>
      <li>First of all, the smell is way too overpowering.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like a tropical scented deodorant and had never even seen such a scent before.</li>
      <li>This product really works as well as they claim!</li>
      <li>feel that though scent was present it did do more than just mask the smell</li>
      <li>And I do love the smell, but that&#x27;s just personal preference.</li>
      <li>Protection wise, it works fine, I would say the same as your average deodorant.</li>
      <li>I like the scent of this deodorant---tropical rush is a good name for it, as it seems a little like a Pina Colado!  </li>
      <li>However, that was quite a bit more of a workout than I usually do, and for day to day use, it&#x27;s been fine.  </li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t think most people go two days without reapplying their deodorant, so that isn&#x27;t a huge deal (aside from unbelievable claims being annoying).&lt;br</li>
      <li>The container is a bit tall, and it&#x27;s shaped so it is a bit concave in the middle, so it is easy to hold.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It will do in a pinch, but I certainly would not want to routinely wait 48 hours before using it again.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, while the anti-perspirant qualities are fine, I&#x27;m not so big on the deodorant quality.  </li>
      <li>I usually like strong scented products, but this one is just too strong for me.  </li>
      <li>- doesn&#x27;t work in that regard, why not just stick with deodorant just in case anti-perspirants really do cause breast cancer as some people claim?</li>
      <li>I was a tad stinky at the end of 48 hours, having not done anything very strenuous but having gone for a couple of brisk walks.  </li>
      <li>I really do dislike the gels  and creams as they just don&#x27;t make me feel confidient</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this deodorant.</li>
      <li>Really??  </li>
      <li>The product works very well.</li>
      <li>With how much competition is out there</li>
      <li>it just makes things gross if the original smell remains at all.  </li>
      <li>It left no white marks or stains on my clothes - that is very important to me.</li>
      <li>Degree Motion Sense anti-antiperspirant, deodorant has been keeping me odor free &amp; mostly dry.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The label suggests  that it will provide 48 hour protection although I haven&#x27;t tested this yet, it has kept me odor free &amp; relatively dry for over 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells like a smoothie, which I thought would annoy me, but it was actually pleasant--and the scent fades quickly, so don&#x27;t worry about attracting fruit bats.</li>
      <li>A worthy aspiration, particularly for those in sports or simply having to move around a lot.  </li>
      <li>If someone could prove me wrong, I&#x27;d be happy to learn how this really senses motion.  </li>
      <li>But I thought it was mild enough that my husband wouldn&#x27;t mind wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice, but a little too strong for my tastes, and just a little too fruity/flowery.  </li>
      <li>It goes on very dry and smooth and just works.  </li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s not a bad product but not one I&#x27;d voluntarily select over the myriad of other products available.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before going on a binge of deodorant/antiperspirant sampling my daily deod was Mitchum, and I have to say that I&#x27;d put Degree Motion in the same performance category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really liked about Degree Motion was that it went on very dry, and it kept me dry.  It also kept me from getting stinky during even busy days with lots of running around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the smell was okay and certainly if you don&#x27;t like Tropical Rush there are other  fragrances in this line to choose from. But I thought it was mild enough that my husband wouldn&#x27;t mind wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good solid deodorant that worked for me as an antiperspirant too.</li>
    <li> I loved the Tropical Rush scent - my family not so much. I shower daily Monday to Friday - on the weekends I get lazy and unless I have plans for the evenings or do yard work I usually skip a shower. So my deodorant needs to work 24 to 72 hours and my antiperspirant at least 12 hours. Degree does the job, I have found that Degree Motion Sense Tropical Rush Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant for Women doesn&#x27;t last as long as my usual go to brand but does meet my minimum standards ably. I swtiched from spray to roll-ons decades ago and this goes on smoothly without staining my clothes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a regular user of Degree for a few years, now. I love how it controls odor all day. This one is no exception. And I do love the smell, but that&#x27;s just personal preference. I hate paying so much for it, so I usually stock up when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
    <li> This is a really effective deodorant &amp; anti-antiperspirant. It&#x27;s been a cold winter, so I really tested the bounds of its 48-hour claim. Effective on both sweat and stink prevention, even with hairy winter armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that if you don&#x27;t shave, this might be a bit on the chalky side for you. I used it both with unshaved and shaved armpits &amp; it worked better on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a smoothie, which I thought would annoy me, but it was actually pleasant--and the scent fades quickly, so don&#x27;t worry about attracting fruit bats.</li>
    <li> Oh how I have longed for a solid deodorant and thus have found it with this version of degree.  I really do dislike the gels  and creams as they just don&#x27;t make me feel confidient that I won&#x27;t start to smell in a couple of hours.  This one does last the entire day plus and it&#x27;s fragrance is just wonderful.  I really feel fresh and dry and don&#x27;t have to worry with this product.  I really can&#x27;t say enough good about it.  I highly, highly recommend this for those of you ladies that just can&#x27;t find a deodorant that keeps you feeling great all day.</li>
    <li> I like this.  The fragrance is like a sunny day- it is tropical with pineapple, and coconut and it smells like maybe a bit of peach too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a feminine smell.  It goes on very dry and smooth and just works.  It&#x27;s invisible, and there&#x27;s no white residue from it.  Of course I just put it on with one or two strokes - my husband tries to take off 1/5 of the product in one application so someone like him MIGHT see some white.  The solid is white.&lt;br /&gt;It has kept me very dry and fresh.  I usually like Secret, but this one is a keeper too.  The container is a bit tall, and it&#x27;s shaped so it is a bit concave in the middle, so it is easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;It says when you move, it gives extra protection.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything like that because it just kept me dry from the time I put it on.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like a tropical scented deodorant and had never even seen such a scent before. This deodorant actually works really well though. I usually like to use clinical strength deodorants, but this one performed well for me. No odors and no wetness. It lasted me all day long. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and goes away pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a nice anti-perspirant offered by Degree.  It does a pretty good jod of covering odors and blocking sweat unless you get to active.  The smell is also just right and not too overpowering.  It has a tropical smell which would be great for the summer and being out at the beach.  Overall my wife has been really happy with the product and really likes the products offered by Degree as the always seem to do what they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I have always been a secret user, and decided to give this a try.  It definitely keeps me just as dry as my normal secret, I would have given it five stars except for the scent.  I usually like strong scented products, but this one is just too strong for me.  I will try it again, but in another scent.  The price point here is lower than secret too, so that sure helps.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;MOTIONsense.The more you move, the more it protects.\\&quot;  Really??  Okay, I can buy that a deodorant/anti-perspirant could react to moisture or heat, but really, this deodorant claims to know when I&#x27;m moving?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not buying it.  If someone could prove me wrong, I&#x27;d be happy to learn how this really senses motion.  I think it&#x27;s just hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignoring its super-powers, how does this work as a deodorant and anti-perspirant?  It seems to work quite well.  It has a little higher percentage, 19.2%, of its active ingredient than the other deodorant I have in my cabinet right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice, but a little too strong for my tastes, and just a little too fruity/flowery.  I&#x27;d like it if it were dialed back just a smidge.  Now, if it were a drink with a little umbrella stuck into a slice of pineapple, the scent would be more appealing.  Getting it again, I would try a different scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on cleanly, doesn&#x27;t leave nasty white streaks to rub off on clothes.  It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t tug on skin as some deodorants that are a little too hard can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sticker on my container claims \\&quot;48 HOUR NEW IMPROVED PROTECTION.\\&quot;  Uh-uh.  Although I don&#x27;t usually expect my deodorant to keep me fresh for 48 hours, this one claimed it could and so I gave it a shot.  I was a tad stinky at the end of 48 hours, having not done anything very strenuous but having gone for a couple of brisk walks.  It will do in a pinch, but I certainly would not want to routinely wait 48 hours before using it again.  And, probably, my friends would prefer that I not do that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I think this is a very good deodorant and anti-perspirant but would be happier with it if it didn&#x27;t make overblown claims about its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This works fine as an antiperspirant, and it goes on easily and feels good, but I find the aroma too much like some kind of tropical candy, with an undercurrent of coconut, to want it on my armpits.</li>
    <li> I love the Degree motion sense antiperspirant and deodorant. The smell is fresh and great. The product works very well. It keeps me dry all day. The scent is light and pleasant. The fragrance wears well all day and stays fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the container is a pain. It is really difficult to twist the dial. I don&#x27;t have a problem with any other similar packages. It is just this one. I have no idea why it is so difficult. The dial is also quite loud. I have had to use a rubber gripper to twist it enough to get any product out. That seems an unreasonable amount of effort.</li>
    <li> In a rush I will use anything that is around, especially if I run out of my deodorant. Degree for women....yes, the smell is fairly strong, and I found the smell stronger than I am comfortable with, but it worked fine. Goes on easy and washes off okay. I used to use speedstick, and that was amazing but it was actually harder to wash off. I don&#x27;t like that residue feeling. My wife used this quite a bit and was satisfied with it. She wasn&#x27;t in love with it, but she said she would use it if it was around.  It did not cause any irritations (she has sensitive skin), but she also thought the smell was a little strong....I guess that&#x27;s the &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; part. This does seem expensive, and I can buy three of my deodorants for the price of this, so for the price, I would personally consider something else. Motion Sensing technology??? Sorry folks, I don&#x27;t buy it, nor do I want it. If you want a long lasting product, this is not the one, even with your arms flapping or moving or whatever motion it should sense.</li>
    <li> I hate deodorant. I hate how it smells (even the unscented kinds), I hate how it feels in my armpits, and I have to wait at least an hour after I shower to apply it or I get a bumpy rash, and sometimes get the rash anyway. I had finally settled on some hippie roll on deodorant which works well enough, but not for high stress situations. This stuff works great and has a lovely coconut smell, rather than fake tropical flower stench. I recently had to apply it directly out of the shower and I just resigned myself to getting a horrible bumpy rash, but I didn&#x27;t! I shower in the mornings after I work out, and I work out alone, so I never bother to apply deodorant before my workout. This stuff works fine from being applied the day before.</li>
    <li> This smell is just too cutesy to be taken seriously.  It&#x27;s like trying to cover up smoke with pine tree air fresheners:  it just makes things gross if the original smell remains at all.  As far as the anti-perspirant part goes, it reaffirms that since it - as well as all others I&#x27;ve ever tried - doesn&#x27;t work in that regard, why not just stick with deodorant just in case anti-perspirants really do cause breast cancer as some people claim?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this deodorant. First of all, the smell is way too overpowering. It&#x27;s really strong and like a slap in the face. The application went on a little bit chalky and it did leave a little bit of residue on my clothes. Protection wise, it works fine, I would say the same as your average deodorant. But I just can&#x27;t get over the super strong scent.</li>
    <li> The Degree Motion Sense works great for me. I like island scent - it smells nice and is not overpowering. The solid formula goes on smoothly - much nicer than gels, which take forever to dry. It provided 100% odor protection and almost the same sweat protection - a couple of times I got a little sweaty. It was effective for over 24 hours - I never got to 48 hours but I can confirm protection lasted up to 36 hours. It left no white marks or stains on my clothes - that is very important to me. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the Degree formula and plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> This product really works as well as they claim! It feels good going on, and it doesn&#x27;t fade away before the end of the day. It offers 48 hour protection. I would hate to be in a position where I could not shower for 48 hours, but I do believe this would help protect my underarms if I did. They still feel fresh the next morning. The scent is pleasant enough, and it isn&#x27;t overpowering. I feel pretty confident with this deodorant anti-perspirant and would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Tropical Rush sounded fun, but I thought the scent of this deodorant was overly strong and too chemical for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the scent, however, it does a good job of preventing odor and sweat from messing with your day.  I haven&#x27;t tested the 48-hour claim on the tube (I am only so brave), but I don&#x27;t believe it.  I tried a few 24-hour days and those were clearly pushing the deodorant&#x27;s limits.  But I don&#x27;t think most people go two days without reapplying their deodorant, so that isn&#x27;t a huge deal (aside from unbelievable claims being annoying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t switch to this scent, but I would be willing to try other Degree Motion Sense deodorants.</li>
    <li> With how much competition is out there I think a person is allowed to be picky. This deodorant, although adequate is not one of my favorites. The scent is a bit too fruity for me and I don&#x27;t entirely buy the &amp;#34;48 hour protection&amp;#34; claim. The fragrance got to be sickening after a while and reminded me of the fragrances of deodorants I used to use as a teenager. Overall it&#x27;s not a bad product but not one I&#x27;d voluntarily select over the myriad of other products available.</li>
    <li> In fair warning I&#x27;m not big on scented products.  So while this helped decrease sweat I did not like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the scent did fade fairly quickly it did have a mild lingering scent.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that though scent was present it did do more than just mask the smell --&lt;br /&gt;in other words it does help decrease the actual odor not just mask it.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this deodorant---tropical rush is a good name for it, as it seems a little like a Pina Colado!  That&#x27;s a nice treat in the morning.  However, it somehow doesn&#x27;t seem to apply onto the underarms as smoothly as most deodorants.  Maybe it&#x27;s a little thicker or something.  I did quite a workout in it, to test it, and there was no problem with odor (I love sharing that kind of stuff...) but a little, small amount of &amp;#34;wetness&amp;#34; which it didn&#x27;t totally seem to stop.  However, that was quite a bit more of a workout than I usually do, and for day to day use, it&#x27;s been fine.  Good but not great.</li>
    <li> Degree Motion Sense anti-antiperspirant, deodorant has been keeping me odor free &amp; mostly dry. Off and on my armpits get damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label suggests  that it will provide 48 hour protection although I haven&#x27;t tested this yet, it has kept me odor free &amp; relatively dry for over 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve been satisfied with Degree Motion Sense performance.</li>
    <li> I must say that this tropical rush scent is wonderful! It is a nice island scent, to me it smells like a mixture of pineapple and coconut. I don&#x27;t find it to be too strong either so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it mixing with the scent of my lotion. The deodorant does it&#x27;s job for most of the day but usually by bedtime I am feeling a little bit of wetness and I can tell that it has worn off. I don&#x27;t sweat easily so I do worry how this will hold up in the coming summer months.</li>
    <li> This little deodorant claims a big claim:  add more protection the more you move.  A worthy aspiration, particularly for those in sports or simply having to move around a lot.  And in that regard, this indeed does the job.  I felt dry, consistently throughout the days, with no need for reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, while the anti-perspirant qualities are fine, I&#x27;m not so big on the deodorant quality.  I enjoy the fruity, tropical scent this has, but it seems to be little more than a perfume to cover up rather than a true deodorant.  I find myself wondering how a scent-free variation of this stuff would work, because I feel like I&#x27;m just putting perfume under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful if all you care about is the anti-perspirant, but not the greatest deodorant.</li>
    <li> This works well - I don&#x27;t use it for workouts or such but more for an every day use. Especially in meetings where I might sweat a bit more, this keeps me dry.  it goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t get on clothes, and has a muted scent.  For workout days, I use one of the clinical strength deodorants.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Love the smell. It does the job, and the scent seems to last and last. It goes on smooth, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with it getting on my shirts. I will be getting this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have never used this brand of deodorant before, but I fell in love with it. It smells like shampoo or bodywash, reminiscent of taking a shower,  and is very gentle on the skin. It&#x27;s also decently sized and not one of those tiny type of deodorants. I have had no skin irritation from it, and my skin tends to get irritated easily. Going to purchase it when my current one ends.</li>
    <li> This product was wonderful. The scent was sweet, but not overpowering. Additionally, it kept away odor during long work days in hot temperatures.</li>
