      <li>the foam around the tips is also nice</li>
      <li>I recived my tips  within two days of ordering first off very good quality none of the tips were bent or rusty which I seen on another review</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good starter kit, the tips fit well but keep in mind that if you have grips where the tip is designed to screw in, these are not compatible.</li>
      <li>the tips are exactly as advertized and work great.  </li>
      <li>Really good looking case and tips are cool.</li>
      <li>Love how organized the case is makes things a lot easier</li>
      <li>i love how neat it is in the box.</li>
      <li>ok well when they came they were all dumped out how are you supose to tell what tip is what i would not recomend if they r gonna keep geting shiped like that</li>
      <li>Love it cant wait to try them all before this</li>
      <li>Glad I ordered them.</li>
      <li>They fit no problem in my twist lock grips and have a nice stem length so there is alot of options for tube setup.</li>
      <li>Im glad I did.</li>
      <li>The tips were ok, did the job.</li>
      <li>as for the packaging it came in its own little case that would be awesome to be able to use to keep them in when your not using them</li>
      <li>this is great for the price and its so important to have good tips that are the proper size.</li>
      <li>Delivered on time but seem cheap and could be polished better.</li>
      <li>You will have to clean and sterilize before use for sure.</li>
      <li>Strong, durable.</li>
      <li>Had to file and smooth out some of the edges.</li>
      <li>No burs and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>A great value at a low price.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean and fancy looking to use.</li>
      <li>product is overall good, every thing was in order and was all there...</li>
      <li>They come in a cool, well made display box of cardboard.</li>
      <li>what if a new tattoo artist tried they would never be able to tell the diffrent tips n sizes . .</li>
      <li>mag tips are rolled steel rounds and diamonds are nice bought this kit just for mag tips received different product</li>
      <li>When the tips came in and I opened up the box, they were super shiney and pretty.</li>
      <li>Overall a good value for a decent product</li>
      <li>like u can see right threw it</li>
      <li>I just bought a twist-lock grip, and the fit is nice and tight.</li>
      <li>had a huge hassle to get a new one sent and if you can see in the pic  </li>
      <li>the tips don&#x27;t move at all so basicly if you don&#x27;t have more then 8 tips I would buy this set</li>
      <li>Good and fast delivery just a few tips had steel shrapnel in the round tips that i had to grind an pull out  but overall satisfied :)</li>
      <li>Most in my set were fine, though some do have rough edges from the machining process and 1RL has a larger hole that the 3RL.</li>
      <li>These tips are heavy duty and finished nice.</li>
      <li>it came quickly, it looks new and very  professional in the box.</li>
      <li>On the lid is a really cool octopus graphic.</li>
      <li>Most assorted needle sets don&#x27;t have a lot of these sizes, but I like to be prepared and try out new, odd sizes as much as I can.</li>
      <li>quality is not what you would call professional but for a little over $10 for a set of 22 you can&#x27;t really expect any better.</li>
      <li>The M range are formed from quite thin rolled steel but again, as good as you could expect for this price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>in other words, within the set there were varying grades of stainless steel, different types of tips between the same thing (like more than one style of mag tip, for example) and varying lengths, kinda like it was thrown together.</li>
      <li>but they wrapped it all over with tape and when i took the tape off it completely ruined it.</li>
      <li>however tracking was only updated 2 times and for some reason it went from.. PA to KY and considering i live in Ohio</li>
      <li>Came in mail missing 3 round and 5 round other then that very nice if the set was complete would 5 star it and recommend</li>

<li> This is a very poor seller who obviously does not care about customer satisfaction and is simply trying to make a quick buck!</li>
<li> If you arent rough with it should last a very long time.</li>
<li> i mean really who ever ships</li>
<li> What i got in the mail was the tip set that has the purple labels and the single side hole.</li>
<li> Had to waste a cap of white cuz it turned grey even after sonic cleaning x2.</li>
<li> the tip size is labled correctly here&#x27;s a little tip if your going to use these tips use the next size down</li>
<li> I found this to help only for the round tips and dimond tips of course what else the tips came in a black box with a squid on the front and</li>
<li> A needle will never see the other side of the tip.</li>
<li> It averages to less than 50 cents a piece.</li>
<li> One reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because they were not clean at all.</li>
<li> The quality of the metal is a little below the rest of my equipment, but that&#x27;s understandable considering the price.</li>
<li> Horrible all are not size labeled and open was scattered in box and metal cheap</li>
<li> The 7M1 was cut so off center that I am unable to seat a needle properly so it cant even be used!</li>
<li> Cheap china crap.</li>
<li> They came with bits of rust on them, I tried cleaning them and it only got worse.</li>
<li> I only had 3 tips only bad thing was someone wrapped packing tape around the case and it tore up the case when I tried to peel it off</li>
<li> Not top quality</li>
<li> that&#x27;s stupid and i could of received my order alot earlier......</li>
<li> i was not happy at all . .</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ve seen worse.</li>
<li> VERY VERY disappointed i threw the entire set away</li>
<li> Couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this deal.</li>
<li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.</li>
<li> The 14DT looked disgusting as though it had been used and then thrown into my set!</li>

    <li> mag tips are rolled steel rounds and diamonds are nice bought this kit just for mag tips received different product then the pic</li>
    <li> The quality of the metal is a little below the rest of my equipment, but that&#x27;s understandable considering the price. It&#x27;s a good starter kit, the tips fit well but keep in mind that if you have grips where the tip is designed to screw in, these are not compatible. I just bought a twist-lock grip, and the fit is nice and tight. Overall a good value for a decent product</li>
    <li> Awesome tips i love them</li>
    <li> well i ordered this tip set didnt come had a huge hassle to get a new one sent and if you can see in the pic  theres holes on both sides of of every tip like u can see right threw it well i got 1 out or the 22 like that the dt 18 is the only tip that is what i ordered the rest have one hole  is this some kinda joke i mean really who ever ships your product go jump off a brige your failing in life</li>
    <li> Horrible all are not size labeled and open was scattered in box and metal cheap</li>
    <li> Delivered on time but seem cheap and could be polished better.</li>
    <li> ok well when they came they were all dumped out how are you supose to tell what tip is what i would not recomend if they r gonna keep geting shiped like that i was not happy at all . . what if a new tattoo artist tried they would never be able to tell the diffrent tips n sizes . . the dont even stay in the case that well when said a trashy case these r supose to be starilized. . but i advice u to go else where if u cant tell the sizes of ur tips (just saying) theses r still nice quality tips</li>
    <li> Item just as described. Great tips!</li>
    <li> The set is way off..The 9m1 can not be used.And some of the tips are blocked.A needle will never see the other side of the tip.I gave it a two for the tips that i CAN use.Will not buy again.Cheap china crap.</li>
    <li> the tips are exactly as advertized and work great.  great product for the money. i would recomend for any beginner. this is a great product</li>
    <li> this is great for the price and its so important to have good tips that are the proper size. this ensures that your needle will not bounce around. this is a great addition to me set up. very satisfied.</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this set. It averages to less than 50 cents a piece. Most assorted needle sets don&#x27;t have a lot of these sizes, but I like to be prepared and try out new, odd sizes as much as I can. Good buy</li>
    <li> Came in mail missing 3 round and 5 round other then that very nice if the set was complete would 5 star it and recommend</li>
    <li> As another reviewer said, what I received is not the same set as the illustration.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is not what you would call professional but for a little over $10 for a set of 22 you can&#x27;t really expect any better. Most in my set were fine, though some do have rough edges from the machining process and 1RL has a larger hole that the 3RL. The M range are formed from quite thin rolled steel but again, as good as you could expect for this price.&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;d had a chance to check them out in a store before purchase, I would have still bought them.</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome awesome! all the pieces were smotthly machined with no excess metal like others are getting, worked perfect for my needles, great addition to my set!</li>
    <li> Good and fast delivery just a few tips had steel shrapnel in the round tips that i had to grind an pull out  but overall satisfied :)</li>
    <li> product is overall good, every thing was in order and was all there...however tracking was only updated 2 times and for some reason it went from.. PA to KY and considering i live in Ohio that&#x27;s stupid and i could of received my order alot earlier......as for the packaging it came in its own little case that would be awesome to be able to use to keep them in when your not using them but they wrapped it all over with tape and when i took the tape off it completely ruined it.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Strong, durable. Definitley recommended. Easy to clean and fancy looking to use. Awesome product for my husband for tattooing!</li>
    <li> Not top quality but I&#x27;ve seen worse. Had to file and smooth out some of the edges. Still a lot of machining on them. Had to waste a cap of white cuz it turned grey even after sonic cleaning x2.</li>
    <li> The tips were ok, did the job. My criticisms would be that 1) not all of them are etched with the size and 2) they are not a uniform set of tips... in other words, within the set there were varying grades of stainless steel, different types of tips between the same thing (like more than one style of mag tip, for example) and varying lengths, kinda like it was thrown together. That said, the tips all work and didn&#x27;t require any modification to make them work.</li>
    <li> They came with bits of rust on them, I tried cleaning them and it only got worse. I would never use these on someone.</li>
    <li> it came quickly, it looks new and very  professional in the box. i love how neat it is in the box.</li>
    <li> They come in a cool, well made display box of cardboard. If you arent rough with it should last a very long time. On the lid is a really cool octopus graphic. These tips are heavy duty and finished nice. No burs and easy to clean. Ive ordered 200 needles of all different sizes so buying this was a must, and Im glad I did. They fit no problem in my twist lock grips and have a nice stem length so there is alot of options for tube setup. Im looking forward to using all of them. A must buy for any home or pro tattooist.</li>
    <li> Quite a nice set of tattoo tips for an excellent price. Couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this deal. A great value at a low price.</li>
    <li> The picture shows the box with the blue label and the two hole tips set... What i got in the mail was the tip set that has the purple labels and the single side hole. The 14DT looked disgusting as though it had been used and then thrown into my set! The 7M1 was cut so off center that I am unable to seat a needle properly so it cant even be used! This is a very poor seller who obviously does not care about customer satisfaction and is simply trying to make a quick buck! I wish Amazon would get rid of people like this as it hurts them the most because people dont look at the sellers name, they look at Amazon with disgust!!!</li>
    <li> Really good looking case and tips are cool. One reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because they were not clean at all. You will have to clean and sterilize before use for sure.</li>
    <li> Love it cant wait to try them all before this I only had 3 tips only bad thing was someone wrapped packing tape around the case and it tore up the case when I tried to peel it off</li>
    <li> When the tips came in and I opened up the box, they were super shiney and pretty. Glad I ordered them. Especially when I did cause the price has gone up since then.</li>
    <li> I recived my tips  within two days of ordering first off very good quality none of the tips were bent or rusty which I seen on another review the tip size is labled correctly here&#x27;s a little tip if your going to use these tips use the next size down I found this to help only for the round tips and dimond tips of course what else the tips came in a black box with a squid on the front and the foam around the tips is also nice the tips don&#x27;t move at all so basicly if you don&#x27;t have more then 8 tips I would buy this set</li>
    <li> good tips im happy with them and recommend them to anyone who like metal tips~~! now i need to order some shader tips...</li>
    <li> Love how organized the case is makes things a lot easier</li>
    <li> VERY VERY disappointed i threw the entire set away they all appeared used there was ink splatter on inside of box lid i have never been so dissapointed in my LIFE</li>
