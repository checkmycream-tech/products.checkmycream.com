      <li>, love, love them&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

      <li>Ok, it&#x27;s probably my mistake...</li>
      <li>These are my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>thing is need more support on holding it together..</li>
      <li>I have long wavy hair and this Vidal Sassoon claw clip  is perfect  for  holding it up in a top knot.</li>
      <li>It also looks like you took time to style your hair, and much better than cheap clips.</li>
      <li>I love that this item is light weight and not bulky.</li>
      <li>I could easily tie up my horse&#x27;s tail with these guys.  </li>
      <li>They can fit most of my bun, and feel secure when</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an easy hair style for her to get her hair out of the way</li>
      <li>I have fine, wavy hair, and these hold it up and</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>When they came I laughed out loud!  </li>
      <li>As shown in the photo, it holds rolled up ends in place to curl them more quickly and comfortably than anything else I&#x27;ve tried - over decades.  </li>
      <li>but they don&#x27;t allow for accurate styling.</li>
      <li>this is a great product for different kinds of curly hair.</li>
      <li>These clips hold it securely &amp; don&#x27;t damage it.</li>
      <li>I never have to adjust them and never have a headache, they are ultra comfortable.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; clips available at drug and discount stores cannot contain my daughter&#x27;s hair, but this one does the trick.</li>
      <li>You can also use them as replacement model for advanced generation Tie Fighters or Cylon Raiders.</li>
      <li>At home, I use these ALL the time to keep it out of my face more comfortably or up in a quick bun - even to secure a special drying towel I use (marketed as a dog towel - heh heh) when wound up on my head after washing.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a new kind of hair clip.</li>
      <li>It is a strong, useful clip</li>
      <li>...but very ordinary ,good plastic and spring, good for the price.</li>
      <li>product was so large that it would not be able to clip hair up in any manner.</li>
      <li>I have so many clips and this is, by FAR, the most useful one.  </li>
      <li>Not sure why the great reviews, I wasn&#x27;t able to use these clips to pull my hair up in any way.</li>
      <li>If you have thick hair these should be perfect.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something fancy,this is good and basic.</li>
      <li>Best for thick hair.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re not big or garish so good effect</li>
      <li>The clips are HUGE, so with my mid-back length hair, the thinness of my hair allowed these to fall right out.</li>
      <li>Luckily, after lots of search, I found them on Amazon (I swear everything is on Amazon - if is not, i don&#x27;t need it!).&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are indeed TOO large for my fine hair</li>
      <li>Best clip for thick hair ever!</li>
      <li>It is likely a great fit for certain people, but it isn&#x27;t very adaptable to different situations so hopefully it fits well for most people.</li>
      <li>have had tried all kinds over the years and these are by far my FAVORITE.</li>
      <li>For a nice versatile pull back with lots of options</li>
      <li>Only good on really curly hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in Aruba right now and the island tends to be windy and my hair stayed up all day.  </li>
      <li>kind of funny when u open your package</li>
      <li>To be fair, my hair is fine but thick and hair dressers remark that I have a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>These are my favorite hair clips and I, too, haven&#x27;t been able to find them for a few years.</li>
      <li>Great clip for people with seriously thick hair.</li>
      <li>They definitely need more teeth.</li>
      <li>It may look funny on the picture because it is not on someone&#x27;s hair</li>
      <li>off pretty well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My sister introduced me to these clips and I remember first thinking that they looked funny</li>
      <li>these are better made than the others I have bought but they are bigger.</li>
      <li>As I said in the caption of the photo I added, I&#x27;m on my last of many and was overjoyed to find these here.  </li>
      <li>I have bought so many giant clips for my hair</li>
      <li>I ordered 5 sets to replenish my supply, I like them so much!  </li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying them, Amazon!</li>
      <li>To be fair I pretty much have a lion&#x27;s mane on my head so it might work for women with less hair.</li>
      <li>They are a great size and hold so much more hair in a round bun than any other clip I have tried.</li>
      <li>photo looks a bit odd, but really they&#x27;re just giant clips (kind of like jaw or octopus clips) that have a lot more room inside the mouth of the clip.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I havent been able to find them in a long time</li>
      <li>This is good Especially for thick hair:) I can&#x27;t find these anywhere else</li>
      <li>I also like the way they look in my hair; they&#x27;re more subtle than most hair claws.</li>
      <li>Look perfect for extremely long thick hair.  </li>
      <li>The photo is quite accurate, and they seem sturdy enough.  </li>
      <li>Any type of advice would be appreciated.</li>
      <li>It holds my hair very well.</li>
      <li>To give an idea you can easily fit a toilet paper roll into them with room to spare.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are the best clips for people with very thick and really long hair!</li>
      <li>It will hold all my hair up comfortably all day long - no pulling to pinching.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not sure why the great reviews, I wasn&#x27;t able to use these clips to pull my hair up in any way. It&#x27;s falling apart. I would ask the reviewers who loved these clips to post a video online and show the rest of us how they manage to work with these clips. Any type of advice would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> I bought some of these years ago but was not able to find them in any local store.  These are great for long or thick hair.</li>
    <li> Only good on really curly hair. Otherwise.doesnt stay at ALL, just slides out.</li>
    <li> These are the only clips I like and now can only be found on Amazon. I have long hair and these work where other clips will not. Break sooner rather than later but still best.</li>
    <li> but one of the clips were broken as soon as i opened the package :( so ...only got half of the ordered product:(</li>
    <li> These are my favorite.  I would not use no other.  It holds my hair very well.</li>
    <li> If you have huge hair, these will be great.  I don&#x27;t... so I gave them to a friend who does- they would&#x27;ve just fallen out of mine.</li>
    <li> I bought this two-pack, hoping I could use them to clip up my mid-back ponytail during workouts.  They&#x27;re not quite strong enough to keep my hair up while jumping around, but they do work well for regular use.  I have fine, wavy hair, and these hold it up and off pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo looks a bit odd, but really they&#x27;re just giant clips (kind of like jaw or octopus clips) that have a lot more room inside the mouth of the clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic does look a bit cheap, so these aren&#x27;t the nicest things to wear out, but for around the house they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> The photo is quite accurate, and they seem sturdy enough.  I probably would not buy them again though, because it takes just an extra minute that I won&#x27;t share to get this claw neatly in place, but that&#x27;s just because of my fumbly fingers!  You may not have the same experience.  Good for thin hair.</li>
    <li> After breaking the two that I had, I have been looking for these clips since last October. I checked locally with no results. I checked online with no results. When I did locate them, I discovered the importance of accurate search terms!  Omega clips indeed! Somehow, I only remembered these saying all day, no slip hold on the packaging. They are still the only clips that will hold my waist length hair. I can put it up before work and it will be firmly in place come bed time. I purchased six two-packs. Can you tell that I missed them?</li>
    <li> I picked these clips up randomly at a store. I have very thick, long curly hair. It will hold all my hair up comfortably all day long - no pulling to pinching. When I accidentally broke it, I freaked out. Luckily, after lots of search, I found them on Amazon (I swear everything is on Amazon - if is not, i don&#x27;t need it!).&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love them&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is they are an add-on item so you have to add them to an order over $25 before they will shift. But we order often enough, I just order a set every time I order something else so I don&#x27;t end up without again!</li>
    <li> I have the thickest hair even past my waist...have to wind it and twist it twice to make a manageable up-do and these clips are not only large enough, but hold tightly all day. I never have to adjust them and never have a headache, they are ultra comfortable. Use to buy them at many stores, cannot find them now except online. (And happy about that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they were packaged two the same color...</li>
    <li> I have insanely thick hair and these do the trick! I have two jobs where I need to keep my hair out of my face and these are fab. Wish I&#x27;d found these years ago.</li>
    <li> I love these clips!  I have very long hair and these are the only clips large enough to hold my hair. I have to use two of them each timeto hold my hair firmly in place so I use 2 of the same color.  I bought a bunch of them because each package has one brown and one black clip.  Eventually they wear out or the get broken teeth, but I will always buy these until I cut my hair short.</li>
    <li> My daughter has shoulder length hair, but it&#x27;s super thick and wavy. One of these will hold her hair up in a messy twist updo for hours without having to be repositioned. It&#x27;s an easy hair style for her to get her hair out of the way and she loves these clips.</li>
    <li> Look perfect for extremely long thick hair.  Once my hair grows longer or thicker, these clasps will be perfect.  For the present, I am unable to use these hair clips.</li>
    <li> I have long wavy hair and this Vidal Sassoon claw clip  is perfect  for  holding it up in a top knot.</li>
    <li> I have really long, thick, wavy hair and have been trying to search for a hair clip that can hold ALL my hair in a bun. This item perfectly does the job. I love that this item is light weight and not bulky. The design is genius and simple.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, really long hair.  Its hard to find any clips like this that will hold all my hair, but these really do.</li>
    <li> My hair is down to the center of my back. I have fine hair and it&#x27;s slightly wavy. Regular clips were becoming tight and slipping so I ordered these.&lt;br /&gt;These are BIG clips. To give an idea you can easily fit a toilet paper roll into them with room to spare.&lt;br /&gt;They are indeed TOO large for my fine hair but I can JUST get them to stay if I pull my hair into a bun.&lt;br /&gt;These clips are better for THICK hair I think. If you have thick hair these should be perfect. They do have a great hold too.</li>
    <li> Got them for my girlfriend. You can also use them as replacement model for advanced generation Tie Fighters or Cylon Raiders.</li>
    <li> These cllips are perfect for my hair.  I have fine but very thick hair, and regular clips are just not capable of keeping my hair up.  So happy to find them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have thick mid-back length hair. These clips hold it securely &amp; don&#x27;t damage it. One arrived broken. The other lasted about 2 years before it broke. I&#x27;m planning to buy more, however, because they hold so well. I also like the way they look in my hair; they&#x27;re more subtle than most hair claws.</li>
    <li> I have long, wavy and thick hair so this clips work perfect!  I also like that it has just the right amount of claws so it does not pull my hair too tight.  It may look funny on the picture because it is not on someone&#x27;s hair but once you see these on someone&#x27;s hair, you will change your mind about not buying it.  Unfortunately, I could no longer find them at the stores I shop at cuz I wanted to get another pair.  The brown finally broke after 2 years of use!  I like the uniqueness of the design.</li>
    <li> I really like this claw clip, especially because it is wingless.  I had a couple that broke, but I returned them and Amazon replaced them without any hassle. The look is lovely in my hair too.</li>
    <li> Great clip for people with seriously thick hair. The &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; clips available at drug and discount stores cannot contain my daughter&#x27;s hair, but this one does the trick.</li>
    <li> these work great and they&#x27;re not big or garish so good effect</li>
    <li> These are good quality, and maybe it is just me but they don&#x27;t allow for accurate styling. They also didn&#x27;t hold all my hair as well as a scruncii and it pulled what it did hold too tight so it hurt my scapl. To be fair I pretty much have a lion&#x27;s mane on my head so it might work for women with less hair. For a nice versatile pull back with lots of options I recommend Interlocking Banana Combs Hair Clip French Side Comb Holder 80&#x27;s 90&#x27;s Soft and Bendable Plastic Updo Hair Clip.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, but I think if I had thicker hair, they would have been perfect. Very well made, look like they will last a long time. The clips are HUGE, so with my mid-back length hair, the thinness of my hair allowed these to fall right out.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mother and she loves them. It also looks like you took time to style your hair, and much better than cheap clips.</li>
    <li> product was so large that it would not be able to clip hair up in any manner.</li>
    <li> Best clip for thick hair ever!</li>
    <li> This is good Especially for thick hair:) I can&#x27;t find these anywhere else I would buy it again...&lt;br /&gt;One thing is need more support on holding it together..</li>
    <li> I like these alot and wear the black one almost every day! I am looking to sharing the complements I have gotten on the Black one very much.</li>
    <li> it maybe because i&#x27;m not using these correctly, i don&#x27;t know but my hair keep falling out of them... they are nice looking and i wish they would work for me... maybe someone can give me a hint on how to make them work for me and i can change this to a 5 star...</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with the size of these clips. While it does say large and I expected it to require a lot of hair to actually stay in place, these clips are flimsy. They just aren&#x27;t made to hold a lot of hair without slipping. They definitely need more teeth.</li>
    <li> Ok, it&#x27;s probably my mistake...was there a size listed for these?  When they came I laughed out loud!  I could easily tie up my horse&#x27;s tail with these guys.  (slight exaggeration)  Seriously if you have hair that is this thick I&#x27;d love to see it!</li>
    <li> You need lots of hair to keep it on, i have a normal volume hair, but it is not for me.</li>
    <li> These are the best clips for people with very thick and really long hair! I just wished the places didn&#x27;t stop selling them!</li>
    <li> My hair shattered these after a few uses, don&#x27;t bother! Also, I have A LOT of hair and these were very big.</li>
    <li> I really loved these clips when I had thicker hair; before my hair got layered. I like clipping up my hair after the shower and these worked amazingly. After my layers, I am unable to use these. Unfortunately, they do not stay in my hair when it&#x27;s not as thick.</li>
    <li> Am not sure how it works on small hair .. Bit dissapointed cos it&#x27;s too large and not really working like a clip on my hair</li>
    <li> One of the few clips that holds all my hair but also looks a little more elegant than the regular ones.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair and traditional hair clips can&#x27;t hold it these have been the only clips that can hold my hair and doesn&#x27;t hurt me. I usually use 2 at a time. I havent been able to find them in a long time thought they were discontinued, so happy I found them!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought so many giant clips for my hair but they never hold on to it. I found this product at H.E.B. and they hold on to all my hair! they are awesome. I still don&#x27;t know how much they will last without falling apart or chipping.  But when they do ill just re-buy them.</li>
    <li> The description says these are for all hair types. Unfortunately this seems not to be the case. Though I suspect these might work nicely for thick hair, my fine, blonde, wispy hair falls right out of these, leaving my hair down around my shoulders and a strange clip attached to my head. Total fail.</li>
    <li> I had these for less than a week before one broke, and the other followed shortly thereafter. Total garbage, do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite hair clips and I, too, haven&#x27;t been able to find them for a few years. As I said in the caption of the photo I added, I&#x27;m on my last of many and was overjoyed to find these here.  I ordered 5 sets to replenish my supply, I like them so much!  My hair touches the chair, is thick and bushy (it&#x27;s straightened in the photo).  At home, I use these ALL the time to keep it out of my face more comfortably or up in a quick bun - even to secure a special drying towel I use (marketed as a dog towel - heh heh) when wound up on my head after washing.  As shown in the photo, it holds rolled up ends in place to curl them more quickly and comfortably than anything else I&#x27;ve tried - over decades.  I was dreading what I would do when this last one broke.  I have so many clips and this is, by FAR, the most useful one.  Thanks for carrying them, Amazon!</li>
    <li> They are very weak, not holding my hair, I tried it once and then they just sit in my drawer forever. Hair looks messy after 10-15 min.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new kind of hair clip. These aren&#x27;t big enough to make it around a bun containing all my hair but they are too big to hold up all of my hair if I twist it up into a line instead. To be fair, my hair is fine but thick and hair dressers remark that I have a lot of hair. It is likely a great fit for certain people, but it isn&#x27;t very adaptable to different situations so hopefully it fits well for most people.</li>
    <li> I did not realize it only works on thick hair.  My hair just isn&#x27;t thick enough to use this product.</li>
    <li> I broke one by laying my head on my headboard ..... I do like them very much .... must take them out of hair before getting into bed !!!! I plan to order a couple more in the event I break them !!!</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick hair and these hair clips hold ALL my hair up comfortably!  No pinching or hair coming down at all.  I&#x27;m in Aruba right now and the island tends to be windy and my hair stayed up all day.  I&#x27;ll even say I don&#x27;t make my twist tight and it still stayed in.  I&#x27;ve tried several types of clips and they don&#x27;t work because of the thickness of my hair.  I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase another set to keep on hand.  They arrived on time and packaged in bubble wrap henceforth, no damage to them at all.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair and use clips EVERY DAY. have had tried all kinds over the years and these are by far my FAVORITE. Haven&#x27;t been able to find these at Walmart for a while now. Glad Amazon has them. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The only hair clips that will hold all of my hair. I have to use two of them but they are so great.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for different kinds of curly hair. It&#x27;s a wonderful hairclip. Keeps the hair all together without damaging your curls.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and all the other post were correct, this is for thick hair only. Works for my hair.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find anywhere else, the only thing that will hold my hair up and not fall out.</li>
    <li> They can fit most of my bun, and feel secure when on.&lt;br /&gt;They feel a bit fragile, but I&#x27;ll just be extra careful handling them.</li>
    <li> Love this. They hold my long thick hair in place and I can&#x27;t find the. In walmart &amp; target anymore.</li>
    <li> I use hair clips daily, I won&#x27;t even sleep without them, so they usually don&#x27;t last very long. I always end up dropping them and breaking them or they snap at the spring because I can&#x27;t leave them alone..these are better made than the others I have bought but they are bigger. I usually use these to pin a pony tail to the back of my head if that makes sense.</li>
    <li> My sister introduced me to these clips and I remember first thinking that they looked funny and like they wouldn&#x27;t hold up your hair. I was wrong and was sold on buying one but then I could not find them anywhere in stores. I was SO happy when I found them on Amazon! I have medium length wavy hair and when I roll it and spin it into a bun these clips hold the bun perfectly. They are a great size and hold so much more hair in a round bun than any other clip I have tried. It is a strong, useful clip so don&#x27;t let the odd shape of it mislead you!</li>
    <li> ...but very ordinary ,good plastic and spring, good for the price. Best for thick hair. I was looking for something fancy,this is good and basic.</li>
    <li> They are big, not for thin short hair got them quick though they are sturdy not cheapy 3 stars for not saying its for thickest human hair ...kind of funny when u open your package</li>
