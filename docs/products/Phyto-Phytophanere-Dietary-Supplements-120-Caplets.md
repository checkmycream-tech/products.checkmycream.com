      <li>The supplements have also made my eyelashes look amazing...</li>
      <li>To be real honest, it did not do anything for my nails, but has worked wonders for my hair, which to me is more important.  </li>
      <li>I liked it for about a day, then decided that it wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
      <li>I have just completed the first 120 caplets of Phyto and I have seen great results in my hair.  </li>
      <li>but I get more compliments on them since I&#x27;ve been taking them</li>
      <li>She is pleased with the product results.  </li>
      <li>online makes it even better.  </li>
      <li>In spite of some of the drawbacks, I will be purchasing caplets for 2 more months</li>
      <li>and I really think they do a great job on strengthing my hair and my nails.</li>
      <li>Went to the TOP, TOP, he said it was a crossing of meds.  </li>
      <li>Went to TOP Beverly Hills Dermo&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen video&#x27;s and photos of me 6 months ago and my bald spot was much more noticeable then</li>
      <li>I tried Nixon and heard that had great results for some, I didn&#x27;t&#x27; notice much difference and didn&#x27;t like the shampoo and leave on thing that burns.</li>
      <li>This is truly a wonderful product, it miraculous brought my hair back to life.</li>
      <li>My split ends have almost disappeared and it&#x27;s not coming out any more.</li>
      <li>My eye lashes are much more luscious and have grown longer and fuller.  </li>
      <li>My hair has a healthy shine, is more fortified, and has virtually no split ends.  </li>
      <li>they started filling in more than they ever have before</li>
      <li>Purchasing this product through Amazon got me the best possible price as well.</li>
      <li>Notably, it has never upset my stomach, the way iron supplements often can.</li>
      <li>hair is important for the ego!</li>
      <li>My hair does seem to be much more healthier.</li>
      <li>So,one more time i&#x27;ll never deal with  you again</li>
      <li>I have my hair highlighted, so I&#x27;m having to go more often.....</li>
      <li>and she said the ingredients are safe.  </li>
      <li>I decided to buy another bottle because my skin looks better now</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these vitamins.  </li>
      <li>eat healthy for shiny hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>So far so good though!</li>
      <li>However I highly recommend the Phytocyane Revitalizing shampoo for thinning hair, it gives great body to thinning hair.</li>
      <li>Pretty good product.</li>
      <li>I was told a long time ago to refrigerate pills to get the best potentcy out of them.</li>
      <li>but I think this one is pretty good and</li>
      <li>but so far, I am more than pleased and would recommend them to anyone who asks!!</li>
      <li>i enjoy better hair growth and nail growth while consuming this product.  </li>
      <li>My nails have grown quickly and are very strong, so for that I give it 5 star rating.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it makes my skin, nails and hair feel and look very fresh and strong.</li>
      <li>The package says it takes about four months to see full results, so I have hope that the hair growth will continue!    </li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;d say these supplements do all they claim (even though I&#x27;m still waiting to see full results on my hair!).</li>
      <li>The pills are easy to take and they have a chocolate tase (which I like).</li>
      <li>Easy to swallow, it works well on my nails.</li>
      <li>They were easy to take, no upset stomach.</li>
      <li>I have three more months to go, but so far I am very pleased.  </li>
      <li>My fine hair is stronger and growing as it did before the years of damage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to buy as much as I can before too many people get wind and the price goes up!</li>
      <li>They have made a huge improvement in my hair growth and thickness.  </li>
      <li>...Wish it was gluten free.</li>
      <li>No wonder they were selling them so cheap.  </li>
      <li>I am constantly getting compliments on how great my hair looks.</li>
      <li>(I have to shave my legs more often though, haha, because it makes that hair grow faster too!)</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re worth it, yes?!</li>
      <li>I had to take iron supplements, and within a month my hair was becoming dramatically thicker (better than normal).</li>
      <li>Prior to taking the Phyto vitamins I encountered a great deal of breakage and shedding in my hair, but even after the first week of consumption I could see changes taking place.  </li>
      <li>people should know, not a lot of guys will talk about this, but most guys are very concerned with hair</li>
      <li>On the bottle, it is recommended that you continue to use the product for four months (two bottles) before you will see the full results.  </li>
      <li>This is good stuff and you will notice your hair thicken, especially if you have not used this before.</li>
      <li>My nails have also started growing quickly and they&#x27;re getting pretty strong.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are super affordable, I bought mine for around 16 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>was recommended these from the Lady that works the cashier at Super Supplements.</li>
      <li>Being a young African-American woman, I was not too sure that pills would make my hair grow--which was the primary reason I made this purchase.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think that this is worthy the money.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve seen tremendous progress in my hair and also my nails.</li>
      <li>I am very consistent with my vitamin intake.</li>
      <li>It takes time to get the full results, but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
      <li>so im sure this is new hair growth</li>
      <li>so I was pretty excited about this product.     </li>
      <li>It is worth the money.</li>
      <li>Defenitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>and I was about to cease its use when I came across the far more favorable price advertised by AMAZON....</li>
      <li>Its worth every penny.</li>
      <li>This product, though pricey, really improved my hair &amp; nails significantly.  </li>
      <li>I use to see a significant improvement on my air growth, but not that much this time around.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not down for sexual side affects that many of my male friends have had with propecia, I&#x27;d rather be bald.</li>
      <li>My hair was coming back in fine, but since I started taking these supplements, it is not only coming in faster, but very healthy.</li>
      <li>I constantly have to blot oil throughout the day to help prevent breakouts, which have greatly increased since starting Phyto vitamins.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These vitamins are wonderful!  They have made a huge improvement in my hair growth and thickness.  I did notice that as soon as I stopped taking them, the hairloss resumed, so I definitely will be taking these for life!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help with my nail growth. This product did absolutely nothing for them. I have brittle nails and was hoping this regimen combined with moisturizing and good care would help me grow them. Nope. I was pretty disappointing. Also, I noticed no effect on my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle based on the good reviews and had no results at all. I ended up purchasing biotin pills at the drug store vitamin section and it has helped considerably. I don&#x27;t think that this is worthy the money.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. My eyelashes do seem longer and definitely slows down hair loss. I have little hairs growing i didnt have before so im sure this is new hair growth but i have to keep trying it for longer than two months.</li>
    <li> My hair had been thinning and brittle for about a year before I was diagnosed with Pernicious Anemia, I thought it was stress-but I believe the anemia was a big factor....  Once I got fixed up medically for the anemia and at the same time started a 4 month regimen on the Phyto hair vitamins, my hair has definetly come back in full and stronger. I also abstain from using the flat iron on high and only about twice a week. My hair does seem to be much more healthier. It&#x27;s sooo hard to gauge something like this - but I&#x27;d say it definetly didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Using as a supplement for hair and nails. Was referred to me by a friend. I received my order not on the date as promised, but the day after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d purchase these over and over. They were easy to take, no upset stomach. My hair and nails have grown a lot since using these vitamins. I am very consistent with my vitamin intake. I finished a bottle in 2 months as directed. They do work.</li>
    <li> The only reason I bought this product is because my wife says that it works. She&#x27;s been taking it for a while now and says that her hair is much stronger and not falling out.[[ASIN:B000PH8KDW PHYTO Phytophanere with Vitamins and Essential Fatty Acids 120 ea]]</li>
    <li> Very happy with the Phyto supplement.  I had a crazy moment and cut my hair off at my last birthday (why my hairdresser didn&#x27;t stop me is a little suspect).  I liked it for about a day, then decided that it wasn&#x27;t for me.  I&#x27;m in the process of growing back the 12 inches that I cut off (dummy!).  I have my hair highlighted, so I&#x27;m having to go more often.....but that&#x27;s a small price to pay to get back to my usual length.</li>
    <li> I was hugely disappointed in the results after making my purchase based on reading the reviews.  I continued to experience hair loss and brittle nails.  People want to believe in something badly enough to convince themselves in the success of a product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> Product was for my wife.  It was purchased to prevent hair lose.  She has used it for approximatily one month. She is pleased with the product results.  We will continue to use the product.  The product was delivered via USPS without problem.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my second bottle, my hair feels healthier and my nails are longer and stronger. Though my eyebrows grow really fast and so does the other hair on my body, I&#x27;m not sure this works to make your hair longer which is why I bought this product.</li>
    <li> i just bouththis vitaminins because my hair was falling and since i starte using it my hair have improve a lot. i will recoment this product to everyone that have problems with their hair.and it also good for the nail as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2+ months and I must say that it has been a God send I am nolonger experiencing that awful excessive breakage that I had for some 3+ years now. This product has been a longtime Coming and I had tried everything but nothing worked until this.  My fine hair is stronger and growing as it did before the years of damage. I saw results with 1 months use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Phyto products for almost 10 years, and I swear by them. These pills really do work wonders. But beware you grow hair everywhere!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I&#x27;ve seen tremendous progress in my hair and also my nails. I&#x27;ll definitely be refilling this product.</li>
    <li> I took these for a few days and every time I did I had severe abdominal pains. I had to throw them away.  Beware of the ingredients below the second redline on the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is truly a wonderful product, it miraculous brought my hair back to life. A must have !!!</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning due to illness, medication, and stress. I started taking these vitamins six months ago, and my hair now looks normal again. I am so grateful to have found something that can make a difference, and recommend this to anyone whose hair has thinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I learned that my hair loss/thinning also was due to low iron, purely by accident. I had to take iron supplements, and within a month my hair was becoming dramatically thicker (better than normal). Now, even though it really helped, I don&#x27;t take phytophanere, but an iron supplement instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron supplement I take is called hemax, which includes vitamin c for absorption and a stool softener. Notably, it has never upset my stomach, the way iron supplements often can. Hemax can be obtained by prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice hair is important for the ego! Good luck, everyone!</li>
    <li> First, many of the capsules exploded during shipping so that was not good. I&#x27;ve taken these vitamins before for also a year and had great results. I stopped taking them and started again but had to stop taking them this time. They made my face and scalp so oily! Half way through the day I was covered in shine and it felt like there was residue in my hair that I could never get out. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or if I was sent old product but they aren&#x27;t working for me this time. I am really disappointed because I felt they worked before this order.</li>
    <li> These do exactly what they say they will. My hair and nails are growing faster and  much stronger. I love this product. Have used others but was disappointed. Give this a try if you have brittle or weak hair or nails.</li>
    <li> I trust this brand, and problems with my health have left me with a thinning head of hair so I was pretty excited about this product.     ...Wish it was gluten free. Or that it had specified that it was not.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product about a week ago and it took about 9 days to get to me. I wished it got to me sooner but at least it came and everything was fine with the product. I have only been using it for a week. I know it takes awhile to work for your hair to grow but i have noticed a difference in the way my hair feels. My nails have grown like crazy though! i take two every morning before work/school. So far so good though! ill do another review after a month or so! I bought it to help my hair grow! I chopped off my hair and i regret it!!:/</li>
    <li> I took this product for two weeks. The first week I had diarrhea for several days. I thought I just would have to get used to it. the second week it was less but my digestive tract just didn&#x27;t feel right. I stopped taking it. However, and I suppose it was due to all the diarrhea, I got a urinary tract infection.</li>
    <li> Having issures with my hair breaking off from color treatments. Saw the reviews for this product and decided to give it a try. Was a little skeptical because of the price, but I figured what the heck. Have only been using it for a couple of weeks so I really can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness. Will comment back at a later date. Bought some for my girls so will see how it works for them as well.</li>
    <li> If you havent tried them yet, and you are skeptical about the ingridients in this product, the price, or the results, I recommend you to try out the Country Life \\&quot;Maxi Hair\\&quot; vitamins. I got mine from Super Supplements where I live and im sure most Natural Markets and other supplement shops carry them.&lt;br /&gt;They are super affordable, I bought mine for around 16 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, thick and I was noticing a lot of breakage at the ends/brittleness, and just hair loss in general during my showers and hair styling/brushing.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been less brittle, even thicker, and even my eyebrows are filling out!&lt;br /&gt;My Nails are without any splitting and they are about as hard as the acrylics. They grow very fast. Im pretty impressed, and the results came about quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I was recommended these from the Lady that works the cashier at Super Supplements. She said they have great reviews and they have been the number one selling Hair, Skin, and Nails Vitamin that they sell.&lt;br /&gt;I think ill continue with these vitamins for now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for about 3 weeks, almost about to finish my first bottle. I have noticed that my nails are slighly stronger and also they are growing at a faster rate. My nails always grew fast but they used to peel and brake at a certain length. I was never able to show long beautiful healthy nails. I decided to try this product due to my excesssive hair loss, my nails were not my priority. However it has made a change on my nails faster than it has made a change on my hair. I decided to buy another bottle because my skin looks better now and I like the way my nails look. I am still hoping that it will diminish my hair loss. I do see baby hair growing but it has not stop falling out.     The pills are easy to take and they have a chocolate tase (which I like). I think you should definatly give it a try if you are experiencing brittle/peeling nails and if your hair isn&#x27;t growing.</li>
    <li> As most everyone else, I was skeptical of this product. Being a young African-American woman, I was not too sure that pills would make my hair grow--which was the primary reason I made this purchase. Well, these pills made a believer out of me! Yes, my nails are stronger and longer, but my hair is also growing. I can&#x27;t tell you how many inches, because I&#x27;m not measuring, but I had just got a phyto relaxer a few days before receiving the pills--3 weeks later, I&#x27;m looking at my new growth--ready to make an appt for a touch-up! My only thought is whether or not the growing will continue...but so far, I am more than pleased and would recommend them to anyone who asks!! I am very very pleased and impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> Hi!  I didn&#x27;t get this product.  Till now i didn&#x27;t get any answer from this  company,as well any help from you - Amazon.  So,one more time i&#x27;ll never deal with  you again and i&#x27;ll take care that  no one from friends do it.</li>
    <li> I started taking these supplements three weeks ago to try to strengthen my weak, fine, thin hair.  So far I haven&#x27;t seen much change on my head, with the exception of a bunch of new baby hairs around my hair line in the front.  The package says it takes about four months to see full results, so I have hope that the hair growth will continue!    The supplements have also made my eyelashes look amazing...they started filling in more than they ever have before and I don&#x27;t even wear mascara, they look so good!  My nails have also started growing quickly and they&#x27;re getting pretty strong.  All in all, I&#x27;d say these supplements do all they claim (even though I&#x27;m still waiting to see full results on my hair!).</li>
    <li> I started using this 3 months ago and I have noticed that my hair has grown thicker and stronger. The problem with treated hair is it usually breaks in the middle when your brushing it. Since I started using this product my hair no longer breaks. My nails are harder and don&#x27;t crack anymore.</li>
    <li> This supplement is also great for glowing skin! I take two tablets instead of three, because I also take other supplements, but I when I run out of this product, I notice the difference.</li>
    <li> To be real honest, it did not do anything for my nails, but has worked wonders for my hair, which to me is more important.  My split ends have almost disappeared and it&#x27;s not coming out any more.</li>
    <li> I normally dont&#x27; review products but I think this one is pretty good and people should know, not a lot of guys will talk about this, but most guys are very concerned with hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recommended this by a male hair dresser friend, I&#x27;m 32, male and are noticing the thinning of my hair picking up speed every year since I was about 28 so I know I need to be as proactive as possible about this now. I tried Nixon and heard that had great results for some, I didn&#x27;t&#x27; notice much difference and didn&#x27;t like the shampoo and leave on thing that burns. I tried Wen and think that&#x27;s great for making your hair look thick, but I found it weighed my hair down a little. So I thought I would try this since it was recommended by a hair dresser, hey he looks at hair all day and he was taking them and said it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not all the sudden full and thick, but it&#x27;s definitely a noticeable improvement. I&#x27;ve seen video&#x27;s and photos of me 6 months ago and my bald spot was much more noticeable then and much less now, I&#x27;ve been getting better hair cuts lately, but I don&#x27;t think thats everything, and the thing that convinces me the most is my nails. I&#x27;m actually don&#x27;t even care about them, but they grow incredibly fast now and are really strong and look very healthy, like crazy healthy, so I know it&#x27;s working there for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s all natural, not that expensive and at least works decent for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told you should take 2 a day for 4 months, then take 1 month off, and start again. I&#x27;m going for round 2 now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, losing your hair sucks and I&#x27;m not down for sexual side affects that many of my male friends have had with propecia, I&#x27;d rather be bald. Not trying that crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say try it if your in need.</li>
    <li> One of the bottles contained a few broken capsules and all other capsules and the bottle were kind of oily like those were&lt;br /&gt;rotten . Jalil Taghizadeh</li>
    <li> My hair did grow but I am not sure if it&#x27;s because of this product or not. It did not have any effect on my nails.</li>
    <li> I took these pills religiously for a year (taking a break for a couple of weeks after every few months) and never noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works that well for the price.  I took it as directed and did get complements on the thickness of my hair.  but my hair hasn&#x27;t grown any.  My nails have grown quickly and are very strong, so for that I give it 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this dietary supplement for some time.  I think they help with the nails and hair.  dixie</li>
    <li> If it work it was at a level I could not notice.  4th bottle so this will probably be my last.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I have spurts of hair loss in a triangle pattern in the middle of my forehead going to the crown area.....I have nightmares about it. Went to TOP Beverly Hills Dermo&#x27;s.  One Dr. shot my head w/something (it hurt &amp; was weird.)  It didn&#x27;t help.  He wanted to do a biopsy, why????  Went to the TOP, TOP, he said it was a crossing of meds.  Told me to take Biotin, Flax etc..&lt;br /&gt;It has done NOTHING for me.  I read up on vitamins...w/a hope &amp; a prayer this has worked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I haven&#x27;t taken this for 2 months &amp; I have NEW hair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I will hope it continues to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall keep you posted.  It is a bit pricey but has/is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is sealed &amp; arrived in a timely manor....I could hardly wait for it to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you have nothing more to lose but a few dollars......you&#x27;re worth it, yes?!</li>
    <li> The bottle is a bit different but works well.  Will continue it.  Four stars as I do not believe anything is perfect.  The price was good and shipping excellent.</li>
    <li> Simply put, these lovely little pills live up to their reputation!  The French have really cornered the beauty chemistry market.  Being able to purchase them on Amazon for about $20 less than other department stores/online makes it even better.  I notice an instant glow in my skin after taking them for only a few days, and my nails and eyelashes are growing even faster than before.  I also notice a difference in the amount of head hairs I shed, though I can say it doesn&#x27;t help with regrowth of dead/damaged follicles.  That being said, if you are utilizing a hair regrowth treatment, this will definitely help slow hair falling out to help give the treatment time to regenerate new hairs.  It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 2 yrs now. I use everything under the sun really so I can&#x27;t commit but my hair does grow much faster than it used to and it seems to be each strand is stronger. I also take biotin hi dose and viviscal and endless prescriptions to be fair. not stopping anything</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend after I had chemo and had lost all my hair. My hair was coming back in fine, but since I started taking these supplements, it is not only coming in faster, but very healthy. I am constantly getting compliments on how great my hair looks.</li>
    <li> Meets Expectations.  Excellent Product</li>
    <li> ...but I have not noticed any change whatsoever in my hair, nails, or skin after taking 1 1/2 bottles of PHYTO Phytophanere as directed.  I asked my dermatologist, who specializes in hair loss treatment, about this product.  She had never heard of it and, after reading over the ingredients, shrugged and said, \\&quot;Well, it can&#x27;t hurt you and continue taking it if you want, but I don&#x27;t see anything in here that would lead me to believe it would help with hair loss.\\&quot;  I am a 47-year-old woman who appears to be experiencing hair thinning due to low iron and/or stress.  I&#x27;m all for the homeopathic approach and would love to tell you I had great results with PHYTO Phyptophanere; unfortunately, in my case, it appears to have been a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It seems to help my nail growth  and hair loss. I am still losing hair but * am 81&lt;br /&gt;and it seems to be common with my age group and I believe it really slowed&lt;br /&gt;it down.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend this product to anyone did not work for me was a waste of money and time would not buy.</li>
    <li> This was the first bottle I ordered so I hear that it takes 5 months of use before you can tell a difference - waiting............</li>
    <li> Vitamins for your head.  This is good stuff and you will notice your hair thicken, especially if you have not used this before.</li>
    <li> After 2 or 3 weeks I start to notice baby hair growing, and haven&#x27;t notice any bad side effects. I would say I regularly take it during the weekday and usually forget to take it on the weekend, but results are good. However, hair is growing but still thin which makes it fragile. Next step is to look for something to make my hair thicker and stronger (it use to be).   I would recommend getting one bottle (120 cap) and trying it and seen the results. I personally like it and already ordered a new bottle.</li>
    <li> I love these vitamins! I can tell you from my own experience that it works!!!  My hair was thinning, and my nails were thin and brittle before taking this. After taking this for a year. My hair is thicker and my nails are so strong &amp; long!</li>
    <li> This really does work.  I am 46 years old and have noticed that my lashes are not as full as they used to be.  I had my dermotologist review the ingredients and she said the ingredients are safe.  I noticed results in about 2 weeks.  I could see additional rows of lashes starting to grow.  My lashes close to my inner eye were short, stuby &amp; sparse.  Basically non-existent.  Now I have long thick lashes in that area.  I have been taking the product for almost 4 months. The manufacturer recommends to skip a month after every 4 months.  My lashes are extremely long and thick.  My nails are much stronger as well.  Defenitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Never saw much difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing within about a month I saw results, my hair was shedding really bad after having my 1st child. These vitamins reduced the shedding and have my hair growing. My hair was cut into a bob now its past my bra length. You won&#x27;t see results over night give it time for anything to work</li>
    <li> I have just completed the first 120 caplets of Phyto and I have seen great results in my hair.  My hair has a healthy shine, is more fortified, and has virtually no split ends.  Prior to taking the Phyto vitamins I encountered a great deal of breakage and shedding in my hair, but even after the first week of consumption I could see changes taking place.  My eye lashes are much more luscious and have grown longer and fuller.  My skin has a soft, natural glow that offers a smother and healthier complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, like many others, the vitamins have made my face a shiny mess!  I have combination skin, but the vitamins might have tipped me over to the oily extremity.  I constantly have to blot oil throughout the day to help prevent breakouts, which have greatly increased since starting Phyto vitamins.  Because of the great results I experienced with my hair and lashes (which were the primary reasons I started taking the vitamins)I have altered my skin regimen in order to reduce breakouts.  It is worth the trade-off for now, but I am not sure about on an indefinite basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails seem pretty much the same, no better no worse.  I attribute the lack of changes in my nails in comparison to the results of my hair to the fact that I was more deficient in vitamins that my hair needed than I was in those for promotion of healthy nail growth.  In spite of some of the drawbacks, I will be purchasing caplets for 2 more months and then I will assess the results from a complete perspective then, since it is recommended to take the caplets for 4 months and then take 1 month off.  It is my opinion that the effectiveness of these vitamins should really be weighed on a case-by-case basis, as each person&#x27;s results will vary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about one month and I can already see a noticeable difference in my hair and nail growth.  I have a lot of new growth for my hair and my nails are growing a lot longer than usual.  On the bottle, it is recommended that you continue to use the product for four months (two bottles) before you will see the full results.  I have three more months to go, but so far I am very pleased.  At the end of four months, I will write another review.</li>
    <li> This product do exactly what it is for. Stop loosing the hair or at least reduce it. And my nail are stronger.</li>
    <li> i enjoy better hair growth and nail growth while consuming this product.  other products have not given me the results i&#x27;d hoped for, but consistently this product does the trick.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it makes my skin, nails and hair feel and look very fresh and strong. And these supplements don&#x27;t upset my stomach.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one month now and I already see a difference in my nails &amp; hair growth. My nails are stronger and my hair is getting longer. This is a somewhat pricey product but after one month I&#x27;m already seeing results.</li>
    <li> Really shocked and disappointed in Amazon.  The bottles had a sweaty look on the inside and the bottom showed the pills had melted from heat (improper storage).  No wonder they were selling them so cheap.  Buyer Beware.  Returning them.</li>
    <li> These pills are way too expensive. I bought them first out of desperation because my hair was falling like crazy and I didn&#x27;t know what to do. But when I got the bottle and compared the ingredients with what I could find over the counter in my local pharmacy for a fraction of the price with much more biotin content, I realized that I would never buy this again. However I highly recommend the Phytocyane Revitalizing shampoo for thinning hair, it gives great body to thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for about 3 weeks.  I have not noticed any changes in my hair yet, but my nails are growing really fast...I keep cutting them down! (and I am the queen of whimpy nails)... I took out my hair extensions and am trying to bite the bullet and let my hair grow, so thought I would try this.  I will let you all know what happens.</li>
    <li> This supplement works.  All my life, I&#x27;ve had the weakest nails, thin, brittle, see-through. With Phyto Phytopahnere, my nails grow, they&#x27;re strong and for the first time in my life (over the past year) I&#x27;ve actually had to cut my nails down rather than having them peel, break, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Swear by this stuff!</li>
    <li> I was told a long time ago to refrigerate pills to get the best potentcy out of them. I did experience bad acne in the beginning but to avoid this I recommend using a toner at night to cleanse the face (FYI: I have oily skin). This product made my barely there eyebrows grow back, nothing happened to my lashes I don&#x27;t think. My lashes have always been long but I get more compliments on them since I&#x27;ve been taking them so I&#x27;m not sure. My nails got stronger and grew as well as toe nails, and my hair (AA hair) was braided from a sew-in. When I took the sew in out my hair went from being bra length to below bra length by .5\\&quot;. All of this from 1 bottle of 120 count Phyto pills. Its been recommended to take these for 3 months, then stop for 1 month, then start back. I continuesly take mine and highly recommend them. I did not experience wild hair growth everywhere on my body either. I especially recommend them for women who wear sew-in hair weaves. This is a great way to moisturize your hair and retain length while the hair is braided and you are unable to oil your scalp like you need to. I retain all of my length everytime I take my sew-in out. The price is nothing when you consider the gain. Its worth every penny. I&#x27;m going to buy as much as I can before too many people get wind and the price goes up!</li>
    <li> Give the vitamins some time and don&#x27;t expect an &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; and immediate change.  I am about 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;into taking them and am noticing small but significant changes in the quality and texture of my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Will buy again great product and it works.  I would recommend this to friends .  I have tried other products that say they thicken hair but I keep coming back to this one</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these vitamins.  I take them for about 3 months at a time whenever my nails get brittle or feel I am losing too much hair and I am amazed that within a month of taking them I see new hair growth and my nails become much stronger.  I would take them continuously but they are a bit expensive.  However, that said, they are very worth the price if you have brittle or soft nails or thinning hair.  I have been taking them off and on for a few years and they never fail me.</li>
    <li> This hair and nail supplement seems to be just fine, however I was very disappointed in the the product when I received it. My guess is that someone got ahold of a batch of rejected bottles of product and decided to sell them anyhow. Several of the capsules inside the bottle were broke open so all the pills were covered with a yellow oil, the whole inside of the jar was coated with it and so the color of all the capsules in the jar were faded from the deep red in the photo to a muddy pinkish/taupe color. I will likely purchase this product again however not from the cheapest supplier. I guess you get what you pay for. The only reason I went ahead and used what I could from the bottle was the tamper evident cap had not been broken and they weren&#x27;t expired according to the printed on date. I don&#x27;t believe the burst capsules happened in shipment to me but likely from the manufacturer to a distributor as the color was so faded.</li>
    <li> These pills make my fingernails grow. I&#x27;m hoping they will help my hair health as well. I will order more.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this product to me. I bought it after seing excelent results on her hair. For nails I did not see the diference. My nails keep it weak but for the hair is a miracle!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for approximately 10 years with consistent results of success supporting healthy safe hair sustainability.....my family genetics are not prevelant in my case, as experienced by my parents and 5 siblings.....The price of these vitamins in over-the-counter sales are discouraingly prohibitive and I was about to cease its use when I came across the far more favorable price advertised by AMAZON....Hopefully the product is not a compromised or otherwise completely in the realm of unknown fraudulent underpinnings unknown to AMAZON....Time will tell.....If it proves to be the genuine product, and there is no shelf life issue, I will make a larger quantity purchase after my use of these two bottles.</li>
    <li> I have been using these vitamins for years and I really think they do a great job on strengthing my hair and my nails.</li>
    <li> I have used this supplement for two years now. It actually works! My hair grows a faster and my nails grow faster too. Literally swear by it. (I have to shave my legs more often though, haha, because it makes that hair grow faster too!)</li>
    <li> Easy to swallow, it works well on my nails. They grow faster and thicker and white. I use to see a significant improvement on my air growth, but not that much this time around.</li>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Can&#x27;t believe I got duped into this product.&lt;br /&gt;Just eat healthy for shiny hair.</li>
    <li> I was in the hospital for 2 months &amp; on a lot of medication causing some hair loss of my already thin, fine hair.  I also had flimsy nails after years of wearing acrylic &amp; gel nails.  This product, though pricey, really improved my hair &amp; nails significantly.  Use it in conjunction with the Phytocyane shampoo for thinning hair</li>
    <li> very good for hair, skin and nail.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate this product , but as of today Feb. 26, 2013, I have not noticed any difference in my hair.I think its been almost a month since I started using it. The jury is still out on this one, I&#x27;ll finish the bottle and hope to see better/some improvement.</li>
    <li> I had become concerned about thinning around my hairline.  I am 60 and always had thick hair. I am now on my second bottle, but could tell this was stimulating new growth before I finished my first bottle.  I have found my answer. It&#x27;s worth a try, but give it a little time, hair doesn&#x27;t grow overnight.</li>
    <li> I bought this and after a few weeks my hair shedded horribly bad, and my nails became weak. This was not for me at all. Going back to GNC brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 months and have not seen any results towards my hair. Just my nails. There a lot thicker, stronger and longer but that&#x27;s it  To me I personally don&#x27;t think it works</li>
    <li> I had thick healthy hair for 35 years,and I wore it long, about 36 inches, I could sit on it. After a major surgery I was given Lopresser, a drug for blood pressure, which caused my hair to fall out at the rate of about two hands full a day. Phytho Phyophanere was recomended by a beautician who specialized in clients with scalp or hair loss problems and it worked! It takes time to get the full results, but it is absolutely worth it. If you have thinning hair or a problem do to medication that causes damage to your hair...TRY THIS PRODUCT. Purchasing this product through Amazon got me the best possible price as well. Lady P.</li>
