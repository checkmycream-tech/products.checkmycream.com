      <li>It has a mild scent, soaks in immediately and leaves your hands feeling so good!</li>
      <li>Order from Cache Beauty at your own risk.  </li>
      <li>It is great all over the body,especially if your skin tends to get flakey and dry from winter, and friends I have recommended it to say it is the best neck moisturizer they have ever used.  </li>
      <li>My wife swears by this stuff, to the point that when we forgot to pack it for vacation we ordered more and had it shipped to us there.</li>
      <li>It is gaining such popularity now that when I went online to order more about 3 months ago, the distributor was out of stock!!!!  </li>
      <li>This is simply the greatest skin lubricant I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

      <li>And if your feel need to get pretty for sandles, this is the best treatment you can use to get them soft and ready for summer exposure.</li>
      <li>I love it, it really sticks to your skin, which is important when you want moisturizing ~&lt;br /&gt;Really</li>
      <li>I love this hand lotion so much I bought each of my daughters a set.</li>
      <li>Absorbed quickly into skin and is NOT greasy or oily.</li>
      <li>So and did and she was right.  </li>
      <li>After soaking my feet and doing my toes all pretty, she pulled out Glymiracle and said I should buy some from her, promising that if I used it often, my feet would soon be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>It takes care of any kind of dry skin and irritation.</li>
      <li>I first came across it years ago when my nail lady used it on my feet.  </li>
      <li>Many years ago a beautician gave my husband this product for his hands which were dry and cracking.  </li>
      <li>The large pump bottle had a tester label on it.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product as a gift for someone who really enjoys it</li>
      <li>the price is still SO reasonable.  </li>
      <li>If you have any kind of reaction from other moisturizers your skin will not turn red or itchy.</li>
      <li>So takes a little more time to apply to body.</li>
      <li>I really think between Gly-Miracle and sun screen, it has kept many of the wrinkles so common at my age at bay on my face and neck.  </li>
      <li>The good out weighs the bad though.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wholeheartedly recommend this product.  It is extremely soothing and moisturizing for my very dry skin, especially in winter.  Try it and you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> No longer available at the beauty supply I shop.  No hassle. Just placed the order on line and it arrived promptly. This lotion is a must for men and women w/dry, chapped skin!!</li>
    <li> Absorbed quickly into skin and is NOT greasy or oily. Suggested to me by my hairdresser who uses it when dealing with chemicals that are harsh on her skin.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff, to the point that when we forgot to pack it for vacation we ordered more and had it shipped to us there.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for someone who really enjoys it so I can&#x27;t comment on the product itself.  Order from Cache Beauty at your own risk.  I purchased the 5 piece set. The largest tube arrived with product oozing out the crimped edge.  Since these tubes were packed properly, the tube was broken before it was packaged and sent to me.  I emailed Cache Beauty with a picture of the damage and a request for replacement, but received no response.  The large pump bottle had a tester label on it.  Whether this had been used as a tester, I don&#x27;t know, but Cache Beauty was selling to me a gratis item from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I love it, it really sticks to your skin, which is important when you want moisturizing ~&lt;br /&gt;Really does the job with dry skin !!</li>
    <li> Helped the dryness of my hands but made them feel a little shriveled too.  The good out weighs the bad though.  I would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Vitamin enriched&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not contain any form of alcohol&lt;br /&gt;3. 3 types of packaging which is just perfect for my skin care routine&lt;br /&gt;4. Not greasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The body lotion in the pump bottle is slightly thicker than the consistency I would have expected. So takes a little more time to apply to body.</li>
    <li> This is simply the greatest skin lubricant I&#x27;ve ever used! And just a little goes so far!</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion so much I bought each of my daughters a set. It has a mild scent, soaks in immediately and leaves your hands feeling so good!</li>
    <li> I have been using this since 1992 or 1994. My brother was born with a skin disorder which causes extremely dry skin. My mom found this at a local beauty supply store and we have been using it ever since. It took away my brothers chronically dried skin! Couldn&#x27;t even tell he had a problem.  It soaks into your pores and stays on your skin all day and night. No need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is the price. It used to be 6 bucks for the 4oz at my moms local beauty supply store. But this product is hard to find.</li>
    <li> I work in a hospital so I wash my hands constantly. This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for dry hands.  Works great on feet too!</li>
    <li> Many years ago a beautician gave my husband this product for his hands which were dry and cracking.  We went to a beauty supply store to purchase it, but they didn&#x27;t have it so I checked the internet.  It&#x27;s wonderful for healing, and it isn&#x27;t too greasy.</li>
    <li> I depend on a lotion like this to compensate for a disorder that disables the sweat glands on my hands. This is the best one I have found, and the combo package gives the best price per ounce.  Mary</li>
    <li> Not greasy, works on me and the dog!! It takes care of any kind of dry skin and irritation. If you have any kind of reaction from other moisturizers your skin will not turn red or itchy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the top beauty brands of moiturizer, and none beat this!  I first came across it years ago when my nail lady used it on my feet.  I had gotten really hard calluses on my heels that were in danger of cracking.  After soaking my feet and doing my toes all pretty, she pulled out Glymiracle and said I should buy some from her, promising that if I used it often, my feet would soon be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. So and did and she was right.  After moving away, I went on line to find it and there it was!  So I ordered the grouping you see above and have been using it for about 16 years.  I am now 72, and no one can believe it. I really think between Gly-Miracle and sun screen, it has kept many of the wrinkles so common at my age at bay on my face and neck.  It is great all over the body,especially if your skin tends to get flakey and dry from winter, and friends I have recommended it to say it is the best neck moisturizer they have ever used.  It is gaining such popularity now that when I went online to order more about 3 months ago, the distributor was out of stock!!!!  A month later, going on line again for it, I found at least 8 places (even Sears) that are now carrying it and the price is still SO reasonable.  I recommend it to all nurses, those who do pottery or anything that keeps your hands in water or damp. And if your feel need to get pretty for sandles, this is the best treatment you can use to get them soft and ready for summer exposure.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Too bad it is not available in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal!!!! One for my house, one for the car and 3 for my purses. I will never be without my Gly-Miracle again!</li>
    <li> Extremly good product, highly recommended. If you have dry skin this cant be beat, I plan to continue using this from now on</li>
    <li> I read about the benefits of Humectant in the paper, which said I could find it at Target but not luck.  I then went on line and found it as well as a good deal.</li>
