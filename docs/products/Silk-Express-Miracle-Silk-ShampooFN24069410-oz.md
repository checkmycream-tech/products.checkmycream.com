<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this product, love its fragrance, love what it does for my hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo! My hair has never felt softer, had more bounce and shine and kept color longer!</li>
    <li> I have blond shoulder length hair and typically have trouble with product weighing my hair down.  I&#x27;m happy to report that this did not do that.  Nor did the It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> well worth the $$, it smells good, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, leaves it soft, and best of all its sulfate free</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive.... But so, so worth it. I have oily hair and this makes my hair smooth, silky and  pleasantly fragranced. My hair is not weighed down at all when i used this product. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works great</li>
    <li> This left my hair flat and greasy looking. I normally have very shiny silky hair. This stuff was terrible. I would not recommend it. I normally love It&#x27;s a 10 products. I can&#x27;t say that about this one.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical. Really. I use all kinds of salon brands. I spoil myself when it comes to my hair. I dress like crap, don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up, and overall do not put too much effort into my general appearance. My hair though, when I do style it, I want it on point. I use the entire silk system, but I am only reviewing the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34; but it foams really really well. It still contains sulfur, but not sulfate. The smell is over whelming for me. It smells like cheap perfume. My natural hair is super fine, dirty blonde with about an average number of strands. I had it highlighted for a few years but decided to dye it a dark dark chocolate brown. At first, I thought my hair color wasn&#x27;t great. I started using this shampoo and holy cow, the shine on my hair. It is weightless and clean. I don&#x27;t know if I will ever try anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see those models in commercials whose locks you lust after? Such glorious shine and such beautiful smoothness. I cannot recommend this product enough. Do it for beauty. Do it for your locks. Do it for you. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> first class transaction all the way! A+++++++++++</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair, and it tends to get frizzy with any humidity, and fried with highlighting and flat ironing. This is a very nourishing product for my hair, and I find that the &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; products soften and moisturize my hair. I have tried many other products, but this is the only line that truly works for my hair. Pricey, but worth the end result!</li>
    <li> Have used this product now for almost a year.  Wouldn&#x27;t use another.  Originally purchased from my stylist.  Not only do I love this, but visitors at my home love it as well.</li>
    <li> Like the shampoo, hate the smell, it smells like old lady rose stuff.  The It&#x27;s a 10 keratin shampoo smells so much better and is totally awesome!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  My hair has definitely thickened since I&#x27;ve used it which a good think for a middle-aged man who&#x27;s hair is starting to then a bit.  As much as I love it, and all the it&#x27;s a 10 products - there are cheaper ways to buy.  I&#x27;m buying now through my local hair wholesaler in Austin - and it&#x27;s alot cheaper.  You get the big bottles, but then have to transfer to the smaller ones - oh well.  cost is that much better.  and it&#x27;s not often anybody beats amazon</li>
    <li> This shampoo is makes my hair feel very silky and soft. Defiantly recommend.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo EVER!</li>
    <li> I love this product; however, I am allergic to the smell. The 2 days I used it, my hair was immediately calm and manageable. I have long (mid-back) thin hair, and I ride a motorcycle. No matter what I do to protect it, I end up with frizzy ends. This shampoo combined with the conditioner made my hair manageable and the frizz was all but gone.</li>
    <li> Tried it based on other reviews and they&#x27;re all true!  Smells great, leaves my hair silky soft, manageable, and here on Amazon it was a great price from over at my local Walgreens.  I use heat occasionally, and not very much residual product at all.  This stuff really does make my hair fresh from the salon clean and bouncy! Will buy another bottle when it runs out.</li>
    <li> SMELLS SO GOOD AND WORKS WELL</li>
    <li> I love this silky shampoo! It&#x27;s so gentle on my curly hair!</li>
    <li> I went to a hair show and this shampoo was provided in a gift bag. I have fine, thin hair and have a hard time finding shampoo that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. This stuff is nothing short of amazing. It really is a miracle!</li>
    <li> Really great product, smells great and makes my hair look and feel better.  My hair is super soft now and people have noticed and commented that my hair looks healthy and shiny</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I have ever tried.....hands down!  To start with, it smells wonderful!  It leaves my hair very soft, smooth and healthy looking!  Good thing I have Amazon Prime so I can get the product delivered fast!  ;)</li>
    <li> This was recommended to my daughter and I from our hairdresser as we both have fine hair. Works really great.</li>
    <li> Great value compared to what my local salon charges! This product really does a great job on my hair. I switched to this from Aveda and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d love this shampoo, but it&#x27;s just okay. It&#x27;s not worth the exorbitantly high price, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It has literally changed how my hair looks.  I am a bleached blonde and I use either the hair dryer or a curling iron each day.  This means my hair is not in the best shape.  Between this shampoo, the leave in blonde conditioner (It&#x27;s a 10) and the conditioner in this line, I can now say I have gorgeous hair.  I actually used a different shampoo in the same line, however, this one works the best for my hair.  My frizzy, dry hair looks silky and shiny with this stuff.  When you wash with this, you only need a dime size - I rub that between my two hands, put it in my hair, and it lathers up beautifully, rinses clean, and your hair feels like silk when you rinse it.  It&#x27;s just the best, worth every cent, and I hope they never discontinue this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Great Price!</li>
    <li> This Shampoo and Conditioner are AMAZING for those of us wearing hair weaves.  My hair looks better when I wash and and set it at home than it does when my high-end hair dresser does it at the salon!  My hair comes out silky, glistening and VERY easy to dry and curl with a curling iron or flat iron after washing and conditioning.  I give this shampoo and conditioner SIX STAR!!  I am giving my &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; of other shampoos and conditioners that have failed to live up to my expectations to my husband!  Thanks to the great team of researchers who developed these wonderful products!</li>
    <li> absolutely  awesome my new favourite  a little goes a long way....i recommend to EVERYONE...&lt;br /&gt;NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;many thanks☆☆☆☆</li>
    <li> I was really dissapointed in this product, I have dry hair but easily managed, this actually made my hair fell drier. I think because i have been using natural products without chemicals and since this shampoo is very chemically intense it just did not work on my hair. I paid $25.99 for a 10fl oz bottle.</li>
    <li> I love the 10-leave in product and I literally use it every day, but I was not as impressed with the shampoo.  It was ok, but not great and not something I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I like but it does help moisturize and keep your hair color.</li>
    <li> To start off with - I&#x27;m an avid fan of the It&#x27;s a 10 products so I&#x27;m rating the Silk Express Miracle line over other It&#x27;s a 10 products.  They are still far superior to supermarket or even salon quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Silk Express Miracle Shampoo, Conditioner, and Balm as a total set for the last 6 weeks.  Here is my impression of the set as compared to the Miracle with Keratin line of products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shampoo:  The Silk Express shampoo is my favorite of the line as it creates much more of a lather than the Miracle Shampoo with Keratin.  That&#x27;s a big plus.  However if you have dry hair, like me, you will prefer the way your hair feels after shampooing when using then shampoo with keratin. I wish the keratin shampoo lathered better, but I need to use less conditioner with it, and that&#x27;s a big plus considering the cost of these products.  3 stars for the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Conditioner:  To me a conditioner is the bread and butter of hair care.  So this is the crucial piece for me.  I found that when I used the Silk Express conditioner I needed to use much more than when I use the Miracle with Keratin conditioner.  It&#x27;s partially because my hair feels less dry after using the shampoo with keratin, and I think it&#x27;s also because without the keratin the Silk Express is just an inferior conditioner.  I went through twice as much conditioner in the same amount of time using the Silk Express and my hair didn&#x27;t feel any better whatsoever.  2 stars for the conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Leave-In Balm:  The second most crucial part of my hair care regime is the leave-in smoothing balm.  Here is where I stray from the It&#x27;s a 10 line.  I found that the It&#x27;s a 10 Mircale with Keratin and the It&#x27;s a 10 Silk Express balms performed about the same.  They are both solid products and if I am leaving my hair wavy (which is rare) they do a decent job of keeping away the frizz.  Not perfect, but decent.  However if I am straightening my hair (which is most ofthe time) the BEST product on the market is Chi Silk Infusion.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.  3 stars for the balm but 5 stars for Chi Silk Infusion instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I have long, medium thick, color treated, wavy hair that is quite dry.</li>
    <li> i love this conditioner. i only use their products for my hari</li>
    <li> I first found this at the salon.  I asked my stylist for the shampoo that smelled the best and without hesitation she handed me a bottle of It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Silk.  She was right. I love it!  It makes my hair smell good, but more than that, it is a great product. My hair is shiny and soft.  That&#x27;s pretty much the shampoo trifecta for me - shiny, soft and smelly.  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a number of shampoos and this is by far the best and worth every single penny!  Will continue to use this along with the conditioner</li>
    <li> I decided to try this shampoo after I fell in love with It&#x27;s a 10 Leave In Product. Hair was instantly amazing. I&#x27;m hurriedly trying to finish my old bottle of conditioner so I can see what the results will be using all It&#x27;s a 10 products.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has nice lather, decent ingredients and my fine hair takes well to it.  But, as I stated with the conditioner, the smell is something I can&#x27;t get passed.  It is so ridiculously strong, and not even pleasant.  Because of this, I&#x27;m unable to finish using the bottle.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo makes your hair free clean and soft. smells  good also</li>
    <li> Works fantastic with the Silk Express Conditioner! Will never use anything else unless my  hair gets tired of it. I have been using it for 5 months and still going strong. I do change up on the weekends though, just to change it up so my hair does have a break from it.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo. smells SOOO GOOD!  but I like the miracle shampoo with keratin better and I also like the deep conditioner with keratin better than the silk conditioner.  Great product line.  LOVE it&#x27;s a 10! :))</li>
    <li> I have the leave in conditioner and the shampoo is wonderful! It makes my hair smell so good and leaves it so soft. It doesn&#x27;t seem to build up and leave any type of residue either. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and makes my hair feel soft from the beginning.  I&#x27;ll keep using!</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling product i&#x27;ve ever found.  You&#x27;ve got to try this great shampoo and conditioner.  I wish the shipping wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> I feel like I have to use a lot of this to get a good lather.  If I use less, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair.  The smell is okay, but I&#x27;m finding the value of this shampoo and its matching conditioner to be kind of crappy.  You have to use so much of it to get a decent result.  I have hair just past my shoulders, that is fine, and there is a normal amount of hair (not thick or thin).  It didn&#x27;t seem to harm my color.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo along with the leave-in conditioner.  Use it every 3rd or 4th day.</li>
    <li> I like the way it leaves my hair feeling silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!  Keep returning to this product.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s a great scent and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out or leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the bottles were bigger!</li>
    <li> One of the best no sulfate shampoos I have used on my hair.</li>
    <li> This product does make my hair silky, it almost removes the need for conditioner. I think it&#x27;s best used for people with thick dry hair as it really weighs my long fine hair down and it makes my hair seem to get greasy more quickly.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great; you don&#x27;t need much and it works well.  Adds moisture and shine.  Seems to overcome our hard water and makes my hair feel and look wonderful</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, I have colored hair and is very coarse. This shampoo smooths my coarse hair and smells awesome.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! This shampoo and conditioner is amazing!!! Your hair get better with each use. After 5 or 6 washes, I can blow dry my hair straight without flat ironing. It light, full of body and bouncy. Everyone comments how good my hair smells. I have natural black/white curly hair.</li>
    <li> Oh boy, didn&#x27;t took notice I bought so many it&#x27;s a 10 silk product. Did not like at all. ..the miracle is way better than silk.</li>
    <li> Came quickly.  Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> love it, use all it&#x27;s a ten hair products</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My hair shines and is more manageable.  Love it, I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Smells great shampoo &amp; conditioner but really didn&#x27;t do anything to for my hair ! Expected shine, nope. Nothing special sorry to say. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is my husbands favorite it make our hair so soft</li>
    <li> Very easy to purchase. Love the product</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo.  Like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I like It&#x27;s a 10 products, but this shampoo and condition is just ok.</li>
    <li> So I got swindled into buying this three piece set at my local beauty store and was really excited to try the conditioner &amp; smoothing balm! I have thick pourous colored dark brown hair. The fragrance is comparable to juicy couture&#x27;s viva la juicy so that is a gigantic plus and I really enjoyed the texture of the shampoo. It&#x27;s very silky and lathers mildly which is important to me and when rinsed out my hair feels smooth and tangle free not coarse and dying for a ton of conditioner to soak up. The whole system together is probably not the best for my hair type but used with other conditioners I deff recommned this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked. What a great product. It does wonders for my hair. I can&#x27;t wait to try other hair care products from It&#x27;s A Ten.</li>
    <li> The silk version is too heavy for my thin, short hair.  I have the stacked bob cut, and this version weighed it down.</li>
    <li> Great product for my baby-fine hair, looks a bit fuller and very shiny</li>
    <li> This product works ok, I have very frizzy hair and I thought the product would make it less frizzy but NO. It does however leave it feeling soft. I used it with the silk express conditioner and the shine spray with noni oil. All in all my hair turned out just ok.  I am still searching for that miracle no frizz product that leaves my hair silky, shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted!  Great shampoo!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product. I have always loved all of the It&#x27;s a 10 products that I have used but this product was very disappointing. It doesn&#x27;t apply well- it stays in one spot on your head when you are trying to put it on and it leaves your hair feeling more dry after using. I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo.  Great for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> First off this shampoo is for both men and women.  I bought it tried it and find it made my hair unruly and I couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;style it totally unmanageable.  Some people just love it. The problem with this seller is if you purchase, you CAN&#x27;T&lt;br /&gt;RETURN IT, so keep that in mind before purchase.  Sorry, Wen is better than this.  I have wavy, frizzy, thick&lt;br /&gt;hair and I had no control with this shampoo.  I may just give it to someone.  Think its sad you can&#x27;t return the&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
    <li> Nice product, makes my hair feel smooth and does a nice cleaning job. Didn&#x27;t notice any long term improvement of my hair&#x27;s health.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!  I have very thick and very course hair and nothing makes it soft and silky but I used this product just once and I fell in love with it....i used the silky shampoo &amp; conditioner as well as the leave in oil.  I am ordering a stockpile.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is excellent taming frizzy hair and leaving hair smooth and silky...try it I think you will enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Make great lather and smells good! Would recommend highly!</li>
    <li> My hair llok healthier and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for my fine hair.  Smells great too.  My hair is thin and fine.  I use the leave in conditioner too.</li>
