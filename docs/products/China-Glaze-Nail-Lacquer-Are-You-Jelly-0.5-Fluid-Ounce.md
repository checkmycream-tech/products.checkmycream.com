<li> I had to use 12 coats to make it pigmented and even then the next morning it was completely chipped</li>
<li> When i recieved this it had come out all around the cap and dried, when i finally got it open</li>
<li> it&#x27;s thin though  i use it for jelly sandwiches it looks really pretty.</li>
<li> it isnt that hard to look up swatches of a polish you want, displayed in natural lighting.</li>
<li> , it was (once applied) a watery pink.</li>
<li> Not what i expected from China Glaze.....</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t have any other problems with china glaze before though</li>
<li> my bottle was opened and then it was so watered down</li>
<li> I wore it without a white base and it still looked so pretty!</li>
<li> Like other reviewers posted, it is thin and watery, and needed multiple coats.</li>
<li> Normally 2 coats of any Color is enough :(</li>
<li> it was like old and sticky, unable to use.</li>
<li> Not a meaningful competitor for either OPI, or ESSIE, my usual brands.</li>
<li> It keeps saying add words not much more I can add.</li>
<li> After three watery coats, the coverage was still uneven, thin, and totally dull.  </li>
<li> It does not become opaque until at least 4 coats and dries very dull.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little thin, but two or three coats should do the trick!  </li>
<li> I then tried it over a white base, and it looked streaky and dull.</li>
<li> Both are the result of polish that is way too thin.</li>
<li> I am still not happy with either the depth of the colour, or the coverage.</li>
<li> False advertising.</li>
<li> but im disappointed that the pic is purple and what I got was pink!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s weird.</li>
<li> I hate pink :(</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> Please change the pic to match the item. :(</li>
<li> I was so disappointed in this.</li>
<li> disappointed when I opened the package.  </li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.</li>
<li> but the polish I received was horrible</li>

    <li> I was so excited to get this polish because I fell in love with it at the nail salon but the polish I received was horrible my bottle was opened and then it was so watered down I had to use 12 coats to make it pigmented and even then the next morning it was completely chipped I was so disappointed in this.</li>
    <li> excellent polish jelly finish beautiful and bright purple neon color would definitely recommend this color for others to definitely purchase</li>
    <li> I really love the color purple so i really wanted this color.  It is a nice pinkish purple color, but really thin. I put at least 3 coats and still needed a few more to get it closer to the color of the bottle.  color not as powerful as I thought.  Normally 2 coats of any Color is enough :(</li>
    <li> This stuff is beautiful.  I had to use 4 coats before I got the opacity that I wanted, but the final result was pure jelly awesomeness.  Looks good with just about every skin tone.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this polish although it is more pink in person but I have seen it in stores before so I knew what color it really was but besides that it is a very nice polish definitely my number one favorite jelly!!</li>
    <li> Way to sheer. Had to use 4 coats and still didn&#x27;t look like the bottle! But other then that it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
    <li> Got super fast. Will order again. Very pretty color. It keeps saying add words not much more I can add.</li>
    <li> i like this color cant wait to go to nail shop and have it put on my nails and toes but i want orer it again because the shipping cost more than the polish it self its just not taht serious</li>
    <li> I just tried out this polish and was really dissatisfied.  After three watery coats, the coverage was still uneven, thin, and totally dull.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have used China Glaze products for YEARS...and was SO excited to find the &#x27;perfect&#x27; purple polish at my local salon.  Received several compliments.....so decided to order &#x27;ARE YOU JELLY?&#x27;, the color pictured.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed when I opened the package.  Not only was is not purple, it was (once applied) a watery pink.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy China Glaze nail polish, so I was surprised when I got this bottle and it wasn&#x27;t awesome quality. Like other reviewers posted, it is thin and watery, and needed multiple coats. I then tried it over a white base, and it looked streaky and dull. Not what i expected from China Glaze.....</li>
    <li> I have just tried this polish. I have now applied FIVE coats, count &#x27;em! One, two, three, four, FIVE! I am still not happy with either the depth of the colour, or the coverage. Both are the result of polish that is way too thin. The shade looks absolutely beautiful: in the bottle! I wish I could that depth of colour on my nails. Not a meaningful competitor for either OPI, or ESSIE, my usual brands. Not even close.</li>
    <li> Nice color in the bottle but for me it went on very very streaky and wasn&#x27;t as vibrant as I had hoped</li>
    <li> Amazing colour with fabulous coverage. I recommend everyone buy. The best fall purple on the market. Buy Buy Buy Buy</li>
    <li> I love china glaze. Next to OPI it&#x27;s my favorite. I got this color on my toes at my salon yesterday, so I had to order a bottle of my own. Beautiful purple color.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty jelly consistency polish.  I&#x27;m impressed with the formula and have recently turned onto China Glaze.  Haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.</li>
    <li> I loved this color from the bottle but when applied to my fingernails, it looked cheap. It&#x27;s just a personal preference but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This shade doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. It has a red-ish tint to it, and it takes about 4 or 5 coats for it to show up good. Otherwise it&#x27;s like.. See thru matte purple. It&#x27;s weird. I haven&#x27;t have any other problems with china glaze before though</li>
    <li> this nail polish, while being a beautiful color, required six coats to become non see through. and even after all that work, it chipped within 2 days of painting.</li>
    <li> Love this purple!  It&#x27;s a little thin, but two or three coats should do the trick!  Great seller!</li>
    <li> I loved this purple jelly! I wore it without a white base and it still looked so pretty! Needs several coats-at least 2. Builds up nicely. Pretty color</li>
    <li> This color is very pretty...after about 5 coats and a very shiny top coat. It does not become opaque until at least 4 coats and dries very dull. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color and all...honestly, I just got it for the name.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty impressive for the price. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good color, can&#x27;t wait to wear. Packed excellently. Recommend</li>
    <li> I love China glaze normally but im disappointed that the pic is purple and what I got was pink! I hate pink :(</li>
    <li> Fast shipping .Good price . Love the color . Great pedi color.&lt;br /&gt;China Glaze makes nice polishes.</li>
    <li> The polish I received is no where near the color in the picture. The actual product looks more like China Glaze&#x27;s &amp;#34;Bottoms Up.&amp;#34; I would call this magenta or fuschia before I&#x27;d call it purple. I was looking for a blue(ish) violet, like the picture shows. The color is okay, kind of thin. The packaging was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not satisfied/would NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> The color did not match that of the one in the nail salon I found it in.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> i dont see why people are freaking out about the color not matching the photo. it isnt that hard to look up swatches of a polish you want, displayed in natural lighting. the picture is almost NEVER what the color actually looks like. I discovered this polish on a popular nail blog, and HAD TO HAVE IT. i looked everywhere in stores and couldnt find it. found it here and im so glad i did. the polish is &amp;#34;jelly-like&amp;#34; and you need about 3 coats, but the color is outstanding so i didnt even mind the teeny bit of extra work i put into it. i mustve got a good bottle because ive had a total of ZERO problems.  very very impressed!!</li>
