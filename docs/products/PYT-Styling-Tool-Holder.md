### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I know these guys are a scam, so i was happy to just pay $100 for the straightener after paying about $165 for a Chi 5 years ago...!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this holder</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>I love it because it keeps my PYT straightener in its place and off of my counter top.</li>
      <li>So when I was able to find one for her, I was Happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>this is able to keep the PYT items off the counter and angles them up</li>
      <li>I bought one of these over a year ago and absolutely love this thing.  </li>
      <li>Her friend with very naturally curly comes over to use it too and it does a very nice job on hers as well.</li>
      <li>so it is easy to use/ grasp the styling tool.</li>
      <li>If you have large counter space I&#x27;m sure you will find it more efficient :)</li>
      <li>This overall is an excellent buy for as low cost as it is and SO nice to have a place to put the straightener away.</li>
      <li>Right now I have this attached to the surface of my glass top vanity table with the suction cup.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great place to keep the flat iron in while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
      <li>This holder does NOT hold very hot curling iron..</li>
      <li>The aggressive mall vendors tried to convince me these are high quality and worth $35, but by the time i was done haggling for just the straightener for $100, he added this holder, a carrying case, a special straightening tool comb, morocan oil shampoo and conditioner, for $160...!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s well worth</li>
      <li>The suction cups are very strong and in over a year have only fallen off of my mirror like twice.  </li>
      <li>Good to know the holder is worth $5 here, he had it down to $10</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>and I no longer have to worry about burning a mark on the wood from the hot iron, which my kids already did once when using the straightener.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure once I actually mount it to the wall vertically</li>
      <li>it also helps to keep the irons hot during the process.</li>
      <li>Hasn&#x27;t melted at all and ours heats up extremely hot.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really hold up well while in the horizontal position</li>
      <li>and this works very well for her.</li>
      <li>My daughter has always whined she wants straight hair</li>
      <li>Although I haven&#x27;t really used it yet since I am in the process of moving, but I really like it.</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t ready to spent that much on the tool.</li>
      <li>I purchased this PYT Styling Tool for my 15 year old granddaughter for Christmas.</li>

<li> and I didnt want my flat iron to make any damage to our vanity</li>
<li> so bought this to hold my flat iron while doing my hair.</li>
<li> My flat iron goes to 450 and it has not melted.</li>
<li> and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting the flat iron the counter.</li>
<li> These not only help to keep the flat irons from burning up the sink or other items</li>
<li> but it didn&#x27;t work for long.</li>
<li> I used to just lay my flat iron down on my vanity but would worry about heat damage if I left it there too long while it&#x27;s heated.</li>
<li> The Pyt Holder Works great, but my counter space is small :(</li>
<li> the money spent.</li>
<li> Just slightly wet the suction cups</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve accidentally left the stupid thing on a few times all day and it keeps everyone safe from burning fingers not knowing it&#x27;s left on.  </li>
<li> I wet the bottom grips slightly</li>
<li> We found this one on amazon for half the sale price of the kiosk.</li>
<li> there is nothing built into this product to keep iron in holder, very unstable and useless!</li>

    <li> The Pyt Holder Works great, but my counter space is small :( still in all it works efficiently.! If you have large counter space I&#x27;m sure you will find it more efficient :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this PYT Styling Tool for my 15 year old granddaughter for Christmas. I had purchased one for myself a couple years ago. I love it because it keeps my PYT straightener in its place and off of my counter top. My granddaughter kept begging me to give it to her. So when I was able to find one for her, I was Happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any one who has a hair straightener!!!!</li>
    <li> we had seen a kiosk at the mall but I wasn&#x27;t ready to spent that much on the tool. We found this one on amazon for half the sale price of the kiosk. My daughter has always whined she wants straight hair and this works very well for her. Her friend with very naturally curly comes over to use it too and it does a very nice job on hers as well.</li>
    <li> I like the product and it&#x27;s material. I think it&#x27;s well worth the money spent. Thank you very much. smh</li>
    <li> These not only help to keep the flat irons from burning up the sink or other items it also helps to keep the irons hot during the process.</li>
    <li> this is able to keep the PYT items off the counter and angles them up so it is easy to use/ grasp the styling tool.</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t really used it yet since I am in the process of moving, but I really like it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the kiosk when I bought my PYT straightener.  It does not stick to a mirror, well it does but it falls off.  However, I just leave it sitting on the dresser and I no longer have to worry about burning a mark on the wood from the hot iron, which my kids already did once when using the straightener.  I am purchasing another one to have an extra.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this holder and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting the flat iron the counter.</li>
    <li> Right now I have this attached to the surface of my glass top vanity table with the suction cup. It doesn&#x27;t really hold up well while in the horizontal position but I&#x27;m sure once I actually mount it to the wall vertically I won&#x27;t have any problems. It&#x27;s a great place to keep the flat iron in while I&#x27;m using it. I used to just lay my flat iron down on my vanity but would worry about heat damage if I left it there too long while it&#x27;s heated. No need to worry anymore!</li>
    <li> I tried to put it on the counter but it didn&#x27;t fully stick. I wet the bottom grips slightly but it didn&#x27;t work for long. However, I haven&#x27;t been fully determined to stick it to the desk, so it could be just me. lol.</li>
    <li> Loooove this! Just remodeled our bathroom and I didnt want my flat iron to make any damage to our vanity so bought this to hold my flat iron while doing my hair. My flat iron goes to 450 and it has not melted. Definitely would recommend this!</li>
    <li> This holder does NOT hold very hot curling iron..there is nothing built into this product to keep iron in holder, very unstable and useless!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these over a year ago and absolutely love this thing.  The suction cups are very strong and in over a year have only fallen off of my mirror like twice.  Just slightly wet the suction cups and it holds like glue!  It keeps the straightener off of the bathroom counter when it&#x27;s off and sits in it while it&#x27;s heating up.  We&#x27;ve accidentally left the stupid thing on a few times all day and it keeps everyone safe from burning fingers not knowing it&#x27;s left on.  Hasn&#x27;t melted at all and ours heats up extremely hot.  This overall is an excellent buy for as low cost as it is and SO nice to have a place to put the straightener away.</li>

I know these guys are a scam, so i was happy to just pay $100 for the straightener after paying about $165 for a Chi 5 years ago...! Good to know the holder is worth $5 here, he had it down to $10 but i didn&#x27;t go for it...! Seems sturdy tho!</li>
