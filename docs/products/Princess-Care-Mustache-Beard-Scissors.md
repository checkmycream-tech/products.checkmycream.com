### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best!  </li>
      <li>Perfect for grooming eyebrows!</li>
      <li>This works perfectly for that task.</li>
      <li>I have a moustache and beard and these are one of the best scissors I could find out there</li>
      <li>These were perfect.</li>
      <li>These are Great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was using nose hair scissors before and they did a better job than these scissors at the detail cuts</li>
      <li>Very nice little scissors that do a great job.</li>
      <li>Easy to handle with my medium-sized fingers.</li>
      <li>Sharp, pointed, work smoothly, line up perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information.</li>
      <li>Other than that a very good buy.</li>
      <li>These scissors do not provide a clean cut.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started growing more facial hair in the last year and by mistake I learned that it&#x27;s kind of normal to trim the hair above the top lip in line so it doesn&#x27;t hang over.</li>
      <li>I purchased these more than 5 years ago and still use them on a regular basis... if you&#x27;re thinking about it, go ahead and buy them.</li>
      <li>I would recomend, however, if you have large fingers and thumbs they may be a bit of a challenge.</li>
      <li>Not as sharp as I had hoped, but work OK.</li>
      <li>I had an older scissors that had blunt tips that also worked well but lost its sharpness after years of use.</li>
      <li>These are high quality scissors.  </li>
      <li>Extremely sharp scissors and precise.</li>
      <li>My husband needed new mustache scissors.</li>
      <li>He likes these but his has large hands so the finger holes could be a bit bigger.</li>
      <li>I bought it to cut advanced polymer gel forming band aides, and it just sort of sucks at it, mashing the material too much into the cut, and hurting my fingers.</li>
      <li>They seem either old or pre-owned.  </li>
      <li>Could they have been old and gathered some moisture?</li>
      <li>I also experienced some hair pulling instead of cutting at various times.</li>
      <li>a lot of hard hours and days and years of time spent reviewing, I found myself in the top 10 reviewers on Amazon.</li>
      <li>No real complaints except that a $7 pair or import scissors directly from China via eBay is much easier to cut with than this highly finger restrictive little thing.</li>

    <li> The best!  Perfect for grooming eyebrows!</li>
    <li> I purchased this pair of scissors to trim my mustache. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 weeks and I have no complaints. They are sharp and cut through my facial hair like butter.</li>
    <li> These scissors are sharp, no doubt and work as advertised.  However, the finger loops are a bit small for an average man&#x27;s fingers.  While I can get my fingers into the loops, the loops are uncomfortably tight and makes manipulation of the scissors more difficult than necessary. Unless fingers are slender, beware.</li>
    <li> I purchased these more than 5 years ago and still use them on a regular basis... if you&#x27;re thinking about it, go ahead and buy them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard fro me to think of a stocking stuffer for my 60 plus year old husband. These were perfect. Practical and toughtful!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s possible my facial hair is thicker than the average person but I don&#x27;t think so. I received these scissors yesterday and I&#x27;ve used them three times, all of which have been a bit disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These scissors, at least the pair I received, are not sharp enough. Sharpness is relative but for my facial hair I need a pair that are sharper than these. When trying to snip a single hair the scissors push the hair out instead of snipping it. One hair took 6 attempts to finally snip it. I also experienced some hair pulling instead of cutting at various times. They did fine when cutting multiple hairs away from the tip of the scissors, at least there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using nose hair scissors before and they did a better job than these scissors at the detail cuts but I&#x27;ve had them a long time and wanted to upgrade. I&#x27;m going to keep looking.</li>
    <li> They were not as sharp as I expected.  They seem either old or pre-owned.  Could they have been old and gathered some moisture?</li>
    <li> I decided to go with this brand instead of just getting the same brand I had been using for years - greatly disappointed.These scissors do not provide a clean cut. When touching up details with the tips of the scissors, my facial hair gets pulled as opposed to cut - this in painful and irritiating.</li>
    <li> I have a moustache and beard and these are one of the best scissors I could find out there&lt;br /&gt;In fact I bought a total of 5</li>
    <li> No real complaints except that a $7 pair or import scissors directly from China via eBay is much easier to cut with than this highly finger restrictive little thing. I bought it to cut advanced polymer gel forming band aides, and it just sort of sucks at it, mashing the material too much into the cut, and hurting my fingers. The curvature of the blades that creates tension between them seems extreme and that air gap everywhere except where the exact point of cutting is taking place, is just too wide so it starts pulling already cut material in long after the cut of it is over. Some odd thing like that. Would you want your surgeon to use one of these, thus?</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, not as sharp as I would like, thus the 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> They are very sharp, however, the finger holes are small</li>
    <li> Sharp!!! Extremely sharp scissors and precise.</li>

    <li> Very nice little scissors that do a great job. I would recomend, however, if you have large fingers and thumbs they may be a bit of a challenge. Other than that a very good buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started growing more facial hair in the last year and by mistake I learned that it&#x27;s kind of normal to trim the hair above the top lip in line so it doesn&#x27;t hang over. Who knew!? This works perfectly for that task. Nothing wrong with them at all, though they did come in a zip lock with no packaging, which made me first feel a little skeptical at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By a lot of hard hours and days and years of time spent reviewing, I found myself in the top 10 reviewers on Amazon. This wasn&#x27;t a goal or self promotion, but by nose-down focused reviewing. I occasionally get contacted by manufacturers or sellers who appreciate my way of reviewing and ask if I&#x27;ll consider reviewing a product for them, with no obligation or cost. This is one of those products. I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information.</li>
    <li> My husband needed new mustache scissors. He likes these but his has large hands so the finger holes could be a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle with my medium-sized fingers. I had an older scissors that had blunt tips that also worked well but lost its sharpness after years of use. The blunt tips actually made it easier to see what I was doing. Still, this works well.</li>
    <li> Works well. No complaints. Slightly sharp at the tip, which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> These might be for the females, but I am very meticulous when it comes to cutting my mustache. These are Great. I will be buying from this dealer again.</li>
    <li> It works as intended, but the holes for the fingers are a little small so it can be awkward to handle if you have big hands.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as I had hoped, but work OK.</li>
