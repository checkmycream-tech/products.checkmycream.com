      <li>/&gt;Another great brush is the “Small Angled Brush”.</li>
      <li>I believe this set is made more for the advanced makeup user, since there are just so many brushes, it could get confusing.</li>

      <li>The small pouch makes it very easy to pack and use for travel.</li>
      <li>Having incredibly fine and short eyelashes, I very often end up with mascara clumps because I apply numerous layers of mascara to try and lengthen/</li>

    <li> This luxury eye makeup 10 brush set is the ultimate in eye brushes, with everything you would need to achieve a professional look. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, and I have subsequently recommended this product to family and friends. The brushes come in a wonderful roll-able pouch that is so easy to transport. The small angled brush and the angled, flat definer brush are both great for creating the perfect liner - especially nice to use with gel products. The eye shading brushes and the blending brushes all have a very soft luxurious feel, and precise application and blending is wonderfully easy. I also absolutely love the make up tutorial videos on their website, very handy! It&#x27;s an amazingly stunning product!</li>
    <li> These brushes made a great gift for my wife. She absolutely loves them and has used them everyday since I purchased them. Well made and the case is gorgeous.</li>
    <li> These brushes are by far the best I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, and I can honestly say that I would not use any other brand of make up brush!

    <li> Once again Featherstroke has not disappointed... I am extremely happy with my “Featherstroke Luxury Eye Makeup Brush Set”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favourite brush is the “Metal Comb and Brush – For Eyebrow and Eyelashes”. Having incredibly fine and short eyelashes, I very often end up with mascara clumps because I apply numerous layers of mascara to try and lengthen/volumise my lashes. The metal comb works wonders and removes all traces of the mascara clumps.&lt;br /&gt;Another great brush is the “Small Angled Brush”. I use this brush on my eyebrows when blending my eyebrow pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush set comes in a lovely black pouch that is convenient enough to take with when travelling or even to use after a gym workout. I highly recommend this set.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this makeup brush set in the past and got a second one for a family friend. The quality of the brushes is decent for the price and would make a great starter set for a teen or young adult starting off with their eye makeup and learning how to create new looks like smokey eye or blended looks. The case is sturdy and would make an ideal travel case or for back to college.</li>
    <li> The set is perfect for traveling. There is a nice selection of sizes. The only thing missing is a description of what each brush should be used for. It would be a great starter set if it contained that. This product was recommended on ILovetoReview.com</li>
    <li> I have been in the entertainment industry for the past 7 years and have been using Featherstroke Makeup Brushes.  I was absolutely delighted with their new 10pcs Luxury Eye Makeup Brush Set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the variety of brushes as they cover all possible eye makeup applications for a professional finish! The quality of the pouch is great and requires minimal space whilst on the move wherever I travel.  A big thank you to Featherstroke for a WONDERFUL product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great brush set, and found the follow-up communications and how-to tips from the seller very helpful and useful.  The small pouch makes it very easy to pack and use for travel.</li>

    <li> I am not a person who likes to do a lot of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Simplicity is important, just the right bit of eye makeup can make a nice difference&lt;br /&gt;.. this kit lets me do that with precision because the right brush is there for anything you want to do and with comfort as they natural hair wood and metal parts feel great. I gladly recommend it and would buy it again, even if i do not get a discount to review it.&lt;br /&gt;A product that deserves it&#x27;s Luxury label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pros: Quality materials, Natural hair brushes&lt;br /&gt;- Not a single hair has fallen off the brushes&lt;br /&gt;- A variety of shapes and sizes to create any look you want, its truly complete kit.&lt;br /&gt;- I like the small and classy looking logo on the brushes , nice touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent gift for anyone who loves makeup Wink Wink!! :)</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional brush set that encompasses all you need to do the perfect eye makeup. The brushes have synthetic bristles but they are very soft yet pick up enough product to give good results. On the other hand, they don&#x27;t pick up too much product as to waste your makeup as well. The brushes come in a flexible black pouch, which makes it very portable and convenient to take with you as travel brushes. I have had no problems with shedding, but the product did come with a strong odor initially. I suggest letting the product air out and to wash your brushes before you begin to use them. I believe this set is made more for the advanced makeup user, since there are just so many brushes, it could get confusing. The brushes are also not individually labeled so it makes it a little more complicated for a beginner. A good quality set, not the best I&#x27;ve owned, but definitely one of the upper tier sets compared to many other brushes I have used. I&#x27;d love it if they take my suggestion to start labeling all their brushes as to make it easier to tell apart. Since they are all around the same size, sometimes even an advanced user could mix the brushes up. I received this product for testing purposes in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;+ The pouch feels like that soft buttery leather - very nice.&lt;br /&gt;+ This pouch is great for travel - even though there are 10 brushes, it folds up into a reasonably small size.&lt;br /&gt;+ The brushes are well made - soft, no shedding, ergonomically shaped&lt;br /&gt;+ Price vs. quality is exceptional&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- When I first opened this set there was an extremely strong chemical smell. I let the set sit out over night and the smell went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featherstroke provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect set for anyone wanting to get dramatic with their eyes. Or you can just use two of them for a more natural look. Your really can get rid of all of your other brushes as this covers everything. The only drawback is that it&#x27;s very professional and if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing it&#x27;s not really for dummies. I would have liked a little more clarification why I need so many brushes!!! like which one is for glitter vs matt. Or which one do I use don my eyebrows vs eyeliner. I&#x27;ve done trial and error and gotten better with each application and the more I play around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus is that each bristle is so soft and luxurious it really pairs well with great quality make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little purse that it comes in helps you stay organized. It also packs really easy when you travel as well.</li>
    <li> I got this present for my fianc&amp;eacute;. She&#x27;s always wishing she could have some legit brushes for her make up. To my surprise this set is very professional looking. She&#x27;s in love and has already spent hours practicing her make up and using it frequently when we go out. She basically does her own &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; for free. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Exactly what I ordered.. Very usable</li>
    <li> This brush set came with every brush I would need to do my daily and special occasion eye makeup. The brushes are very soft and make applying and blending very easy! I also have not had any issues with shedding which is a common occurrence for some of my other makeup brushes. Overall I really love this product and I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends!</li>
    <li> When I first received my purchase I was skeptical because the brushes were so soft, I did not think they were strong enough to hold the eye make up.  I just knew I would have make up all over me and my sink.  To my surprise the make up stayed on even after applying a few coats.  There was no make up caked on the brushes and as a test I cleaned one to see is it will go back to its original form and softness.  It did with no problem.  This will be a product I will be giving as gifts for Christmass and birthdays.</li>
    <li> These high quality brushes are perfect for trying out new looks and have definitely helped me add some variety to my look. You can play so many ways with make up and a good brush set really is what sets it apart. Every artist needs the right brushes! The case for these is really nice and adds a touch of class. I especially liked the long straps to wrap around the case after folding. Very pretty. These would make an excellent gift for anybody interested in style and looking their best! They don&#x27;t shed and are very soft. Printing the name of the individual brushes would bee helpful but would take away from the elegant appearance. I believe I may just color code the metal with a paint dot to help me identify and learn their uses by heart. Absolutely beautiful. I received mine at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience having used it.</li>
    <li> I picked this up as a gift for my wife, as she tends to do intricate eye makeup. Pros and Cons according to her:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Soft Brushes&lt;br /&gt;- Good variety of brush types and sizes&lt;br /&gt;- Gives great definition to eyes&lt;br /&gt;- Comb/Brush for eyebrows was of great quality&lt;br /&gt;- Perfect size brushes for eye-liner&lt;br /&gt;- Small carry bag to bring with you for touch ups&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Eye shadow brush applicator is small&lt;br /&gt;- Would like to see a mascara applicator included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall she enjoyed it very much and my mother and sister in-law loved it as well. Not really too many downsides as you can always throw a mascara applicator and bigger brush in the bag with the rest of the kit and you have a very versatile set ready to take with you on the go.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Received this product to review. Nice brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes are high quality and nice carrying case is included. It should be noted I received these brushes at a significant discount in order to provide honest feedback. This however did not influence my review. If they were garbage I&#x27;d say so, but they are definitley NOT. They ARE worth the asking price.</li>
