<li> it leaves them looking dry and poufy.</li>
<li> My hair is dry and frizzy.</li>
<li> so I would not recommend wearing it with dry hair.</li>
<li> A natural product that works just as well as &amp;#34;Frizz-ease&amp;#34;, if not better.</li>
<li> Shame that its such a small bottle</li>
<li> You only need a small amount to do the drink.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t find it in several stores in our small state.</li>
<li> It doesnt weigh my hair down nor makes it greasy.</li>
<li> I have about 5% slightly frizzy hair after using this compared to &amp;#34;tones down the frizz&amp;#34;</li>
<li> It makes my hair a little greasy if I get it too close to the roots.  </li>
<li> A con though is that the cream feels thick</li>
<li> The product is useless.</li>

    <li> My favorite hair product!  A natural product that works just as well as &amp;#34;Frizz-ease&amp;#34;, if not better.</li>
    <li> This is the first anti-frizz product that has worked well for me.  I have about 5% slightly frizzy hair after using this compared to &amp;#34;tones down the frizz&amp;#34; with my former favorite.  I like the package which dispenses just the right amount. The &amp;#34;Yes to&amp;#34; brand doesn&#x27;t test on animals either which is important to me.  A hair product winner and I happily recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair, but after days of blow drying and straightening it takes days for my hair to return to its normal waves. Not with this baby! I washed my hair after having it straight all day. I waited for my hair to be damp then applied generously and in the morning my waves almost looked like curls! Shame that its such a small bottle but whatever the thing works! A con though is that the cream feels thick so I would not recommend wearing it with dry hair.</li>
    <li> makes my hair soft and shiny without all the harsh chemicals - love the smell!</li>
    <li> Tried with yes to carrots leave-in conditioner.  Does an OK job.  I prefer Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Milk and won&#x27;t buy either product again.  I like Yes to Carrots conditioner, shampoo and the yes to tomatoes skin care products.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this product works wonders on my hair. It leaves my curls defined and shiny. It doesnt weigh my hair down nor makes it greasy. You only need a small amount to do the drink. I would suggest to anyone with curly hair!</li>
    <li> Works well for the long dried-out ends, but can&#x27;t use it for the bangs. I looked like I had used vaseline.</li>
    <li> Works good.  It makes my hair a little greasy if I get it too close to the roots.  Otherwise, happy with the product and the price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it at all. Makes my hair greasy and gross. It is now in my hair product graveyard. However many of their other products are fantastic just not this one.</li>
    <li> Works well. Smells good.</li>
    <li> It works great on my hair and does exactly what it says it will. I definitely recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite product. I have curly fine frizzy hair, and so many products weigh my hair down, or make it look wet.  This stuff is great because my hair stays bouncy and fresh all day, and my curls stay intact without all the frizzies.</li>
    <li> I have super curly (non-ethnic) hair and this product works really well. You don&#x27;t need a lot and it helps fight frizz nicely.  I am also a fan of the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry and frizzy. The serum did nothing except make my hair sticky. The product is useless. Try morroccon oil instead.</li>
    <li> Controlled frizz and did what it said it would do.  Liked it so much, I brought a couple more. Will buy it again too.</li>
    <li> I bought this anti frizz cream along with the shampoo and conditioner which ended up leaving my hair super dry. I&#x27;ve been grateful for this cream, as it&#x27;s the only thing in this system that even remotely moisturizes my hair, but I&#x27;ve still found it to be lacking in quality.

It&#x27;s better than nothing, but it&#x27;s definitely not worth purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product for $3.99 at ROSS! I have tried so many different treatments for my frizzy coarse curly hair and by far this is the best I&#x27;ve tried, as soon as I applied it to my hair I felt the difference. &amp; c&#x27;mon can&#x27;t beat the price, Idk if I&#x27;d pay the $14 here on Amazon. Hope to find it again at Ross.</li>
    <li> Especially for children and individuals w/ sensitivities to chemicals/preservatives that often seen on the ingredient section of hair products,this is an awesome gem that works very well.&lt;br /&gt;My child was diagnosed of  an auto-immune disorder before 2 y/o&lt;br /&gt;The  hair growth is not expected ( I can claim it&#x27;s a miracle).I am careful&lt;br /&gt;w/ what to apply w/ her hair that started to become frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;This product just does the excellent job &amp; helps my child maintain a healthy&lt;br /&gt;hair &amp; scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish i can get bit of discount because,i can only find it in Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find it in several stores in our small state.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in any stores!  I love this product - I use it once a week to help my hair through the long winters, and will continue to use as the summer heat arrives!</li>
    <li> Love this product for my curly hair. Helps control my curl.</li>
    <li> I have wavey, frizzy, tangley hair. I use another leave in treatment that works great, but i would still get some tangles. So i tried this serum since yes to carrots has helped clear my dandruff/oily scalp with their scalp relief formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this, and not only does it control frizziness, it controls tangles! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It takes out the frizz but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily or yucky.  You can&#x27;t even tell there&#x27;s product in your hair.</li>
