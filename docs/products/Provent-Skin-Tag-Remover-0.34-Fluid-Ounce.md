    <li> I went through the whole bottle of this and I still have the skin tags. At one point they seemed to be diminishing somewhat but never did go away. Can&#x27;t say I would buy another bottle to keep trying as I didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. It may work in other cases, but not for me.</li>
    <li> I had a bad reaction to it I felt it in my throat</li>
    <li> I have been using this as recommended for 4 weeks now and have seen no change in the skin tags at all.  I understand that it is supposed to take up to 8 weeks for the skin tags to be gone, but after this time there should be some visible change in the surface or texture.  They look and feel exactly the same as when I started.  Totally useless.</li>
    <li> Product says use for up to 3 weeks. Ive used for over 4 now and still no success. Not as described</li>
    <li> personally did not work for me, but wanted to try before going to a doctor and getting it cut off</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me after using two weeks, three applications a day, no change</li>
    <li> Followed instructions as directed. No improvement after 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> does not work, smells horrible</li>
    <li> This produce is a waste of money it does not work. Amazon needs to stop selling this from the web</li>
    <li> They shrunk a little but still there. I would not recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I tried this skin tag remover and followed the directions. It worked just as it said it would. The first day it began to shrink and turn black. It got smaller over several days, and before the end of one week, it came of while I was taking a shower. No bleeding. No pain, only a slight tingling at a few times, barely noticeable. I would use it again, and do plan to.</li>
    <li> Used a whole of this over two months using it 3 times a day. Not even the slightest sign of them falling off.&lt;br /&gt;Then I did the right thing and saw mu doctor. She sprayed them with liquid nitrogen and i was in and out of my appointment within 10 minute. They dropped off within the week. Save you money, see your doctor and get it done quickly and properly</li>
    <li> Slow but effective, take your time and be diligent.</li>
    <li> It has not removed a tag yet and it stink gives you a bad odor</li>
    <li> Purchased this product several months ago and used it only a few days and not the 3x daily as directed. The smell is awful and I discontinued using it at the beginning due to this issue. After several months I saw it in my medicine cabinet and started using it again this week. After applying 3x daily as directed the skin tag reduced in size by half and started to turn black.  I saw a noticeable difference each morning and by the 6th day it fell completely off. I was really surprised it worked so quickly as the directions say it takes a few weeks. I purchased from a local Target not Amazon. I have noticed on other skin care products sold on Amazon that they are not always from a reputable seller, I don&#x27;t know if this is reason the product has not worked for others. The smell is disgusting and a little embarrassing to use, probably why I did not follow through with the usage on the first go round but glad I gave it a second chance.</li>
