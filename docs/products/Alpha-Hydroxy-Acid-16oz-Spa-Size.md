      <li>I must say, I love their customer service more than the product itself.</li>
      <li>This product is just okay...</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll shed more money and order the Alpha Hydrox.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay</li>
      <li>I think the product is ok , but nothing especial .</li>
      <li>my wrinkles;es are getting better and i&#x27;m 62</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay as lotion goes, but it does nothing for keratosis pilaris, which it should if it had AHA in it.</li>
      <li>I look like a greased pig it makes my skin so much more oily.</li>
      <li>Works great on my kid&#x27;s skin condition, now his skin is much smoother.  </li>
      <li>And here I am 68 now and enjoying my third jug of this wonderful skin care product.  :-)</li>
      <li>Works ok.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure to use a sun screen on areas that wifi be exposed.</li>
      <li>Top ingredient is mineral oil.</li>
      <li>IT IS OK</li>
      <li>and it did not penetrate the skin easily.  </li>
      <li>This is not the really strong Alpha Hydroxy Acid that stings and tingles but still works.</li>
      <li>has ever been , my friends and family actually have noticed and always comment in how beautiful my skin is .</li>
      <li>They hands down have the best customer service.</li>
      <li>Product seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>Love this lotion makes face nice and soft a river fast seller even included a large free sample of another lotion price was great</li>
      <li>I like the smooth feeling of the lotion.</li>
      <li>Light scent.</li>
      <li>I will use it on my light stretch marks on my belly, but no where else.</li>
      <li>makes my skin smooth, not as oily as some of the revviews I have read</li>
      <li>but my skin feels smooth.</li>
      <li>My son is using this and the Advanced Clinicals Retinol for pilaris keratosis.  </li>
      <li>Seriously, if you want a good skin cream in an easy-pump dispenser @ a great price, buy this.</li>
      <li>Great AHA, can really feel it working, make sure you wear sunscreen the following days after using it!</li>
      <li>I was excited to get this</li>
      <li>This is a great product for dry bumpy skin.  </li>
      <li>Love the large size and pump.</li>
      <li>nothing special full of chemicals</li>
      <li>I save so much money over Lancome products with a much better result.  </li>
      <li>I broke out so much more thanks alot.</li>
      <li>Not terrible, but very greasy.  </li>
      <li>Not bad at all for price.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream makes your skin very soft ....</li>
      <li>I love how my 65 year old skin has responded.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited about using this product it really works.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
      <li>Really taken away those BIG RED Bumps on my arms, (Native/Latino Tanned Skin), so Darker toned skin should also react great to this stuff.</li>
      <li>People use to always tell me I had pretty feet.  </li>
      <li>The first week I did notice my skin was peeling in a suttle way.</li>
      <li>It really helps the skin!</li>
      <li>You have to use it everyday and it is good for your chest area if you are a woman.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice thick formula which makes application easy.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS LARGE SIZE TO USE FOR  THE ENTIRE BODY INCLUDING THE FACE , HANDS, FEET !</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough.</li>
      <li>I bought this cream as well as the retinol cream from pure valley seller.</li>
      <li>required 2 or 3 applications a day to really help me much.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference</li>
      <li>this enhanced the oiliness to the very max.</li>
      <li>It contains mineral oil which causes my skin to break out and become very oily.  </li>
      <li>Worked better than I expected</li>
      <li>It really help&#x27;s the face...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to use sunscreen all tge time, but especially when useing ant AHA!</li>
      <li>My skin is very oily</li>
      <li>It really helps the skin.</li>
      <li>I cannot live without this!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for full body use during bed, and under covered clothing during the day, since it will make you red or burn you they say, with some moisturizing lotion or coconut oil.</li>
      <li>and already I can see and feel the difference in my skin particularly my feet.  </li>
      <li>Currently my skin feels so soft and smooth, my face has brightened.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My feet are on the fast track to the soft supple look that they once were.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 2 weeks, I&#x27;m 27, my skin is normal.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to use this product is really important that you use an SPf 30 or higher during the day since the alpha hydroxy strips off the dead cells from the skin and it can get sensitive to the sun</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> To me it works just as well as regular lotion. It doesn&#x27;t rub into the skin as well though. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this cream makes your skin very soft ....I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> great around the eyes and buttocks</li>
    <li> Great AHA, can really feel it working, make sure you wear sunscreen the following days after using it! Only complaint is when i received product it was kindve open even though it had the plastic wrap around it, had a little bit of excess lotion around it, so maybe a delivery man opened it and used some, oh well, hope he wore sunscreen</li>
    <li> I bought this cream as well as the retinol cream from pure valley seller. I must say, I love their customer service more than the product itself. They hands down have the best customer service.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! So good I bought another one! It really helps the skin!</li>
    <li> My wife and I are using this and we already saw the improvement on out skin in just 3 days. I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> Has improved my skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks and am disappointed because it is not moisturizing enough. I use this all over my body and find I&#x27;m itching from dry skin. I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Top ingredient is mineral oil.</li>
    <li> my wrinkles;es are getting better and i&#x27;m 62</li>
    <li> What I received was not what is pictured. Seems to be same ingredients so I didn&#x27;t return. I would give what IS pictured 5 stars as I&#x27;ve used it before. Purchased what is pictured at Marshalls for less.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion makes face nice and soft a river fast seller even included a large free sample of another lotion price was great</li>
    <li> Very good product, especially for cold weather dry hands.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD !  LOVE THIS LARGE SIZE TO USE FOR  THE ENTIRE BODY INCLUDING THE FACE , HANDS, FEET !&lt;br /&gt;GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR BUCK$$$ !&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I will be buying again !!!</li>
    <li> makes my skin smooth, not as oily as some of the revviews I have read</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any actual alpha hydroxy acid in this lotion. It&#x27;s okay as lotion goes, but it does nothing for keratosis pilaris, which it should if it had AHA in it. I&#x27;ve used another lotion with AHA that actually worked, I just can&#x27;t find it anymore. But I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Good price for the amount. Works ok. I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference but my skin feels smooth.</li>
    <li> The product is really good. Whenever I had a red spot on my face or hands I would put this on there and it will go away.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this!  I cleanse my face with Coconut Oil and then use this twice a day.  The results for someone like me with Rosacea and extremely dry sensitive skin have been nothing short of miraculous!  I no longer use any of my prescription Rosacea medication and can wear make-up again - after over 5 years of not being able to!  Everything I have ever tried has burned and irritated my skin and I have tried it all!  This is THE BEST period.  I have 3 of the spa size and will reorder when I am down to two.  I LOVE IT!!!  And the Coconut Oil I use to cleanse my face DOES NOT BLOCK PORES.</li>
    <li> There is nothing like AHA to give my skin a healthy, glowing look.  This product has terrific moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry bumpy skin.  You have to use it everyday and it is good for your chest area if you are a woman.  I have very dry skin and can&#x27;t use perfumed lotions as they are too drying.  this is my favorite so far and the price was great!  you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I wrote this review 3 years ago!! &amp;#34;I bought this AHA product last fall after seeing Dr. Oz talk about its positive effects on his show.  Almost immediately my pores started getting smaller and my skin was shining, and I only used a small amount each night.  I love how my 65 year old skin has responded.&amp;#34; And here I am 68 now and enjoying my third jug of this wonderful skin care product.  :-)</li>
    <li> Seriously, if you want a good skin cream in an easy-pump dispenser @ a great price, buy this. After spending 3-4 times as much on more expensive creams, I bought this for the ease of using a pump jar. My skin is like velvet. I am a nurse practitioner with multiple allergies &amp; my skin is &amp;#34;touchy&amp;#34; but it loves this. I also was tired of dropping &amp; squeezing tubes of cream, or digging fingers into jars (NOT sanitary). This pump jar is the bomb. I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I ever , I use it at night before bed after I take off my make up , I have been using it for 3 months now and my skin is the best it&#x27;s has ever been , my friends and family actually have noticed and always comment in how beautiful my skin is . If you&#x27;re going to use this product is really important that you use an SPf 30 or higher during the day since the alpha hydroxy strips off the dead cells from the skin and it can get sensitive to the sun</li>
    <li> i like the product and will be ordering again in the future.  i was looking for a product that would firm and smooth my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use this on my body not my face. Helps keep me exfoliated. Just make sure to use a sun screen on areas that wifi be exposed. May cause hyper sensitivity if you do not</li>
    <li> My son is using this and the Advanced Clinicals Retinol for pilaris keratosis.  After only a few nights his skin is already clearer.</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about. It&#x27;s just okay nothing so great about it to tell. I like it as a moisturizer</li>
    <li> WOW! This stuff does work! I&#x27;m a 23 old male who has suffered from a bad case of KP for years, I used to exfoliate when I was younger with some home made potions or what not but nothing ever brought down the bumps this low! I highly recommend this for full body use during bed, and under covered clothing during the day, since it will make you red or burn you they say, with some moisturizing lotion or coconut oil. I did go crazy with it and put it on every day but once or twice a week is enough for a difference. Really taken away those BIG RED Bumps on my arms, (Native/Latino Tanned Skin), so Darker toned skin should also react great to this stuff. I apply after showers, while pours are active.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say because we don&#x27;t know the quantity of the AHA in the product.</li>
    <li> I have used AHA for 4 weeks and it has done nothing for me SEAMS I HAVE WASTED MONEY FOR NOTHING</li>
    <li> Product seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and feels good.</li>
    <li> Like the product.  Would have rated it higher but it is a little greasy on the skin.</li>
    <li> This is great for legs and arms but has a lot of mineral oil in it so don&#x27;t use on your face. I will continue to use this rich formula until I find something which has less mineral oil &amp; ceteatryl alcohol that is not runny. This is a nice thick formula which makes application easy. It&#x27;s important to use sunscreen all tge time, but especially when useing ant AHA!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this but it gives me horrible acne. I will use it on my light stretch marks on my belly, but no where else. I like the smooth feeling of the lotion.</li>
    <li> I get dry, flaky skin in the winter unless I use this lotion at least every other day.  I had had dry, flaky skin when I first bought it and it cured the problem.  I highly recommend this lotion for dry, itchy winter skin.</li>
    <li> It really help&#x27;s the face...</li>
    <li> Smoothingly keratolytic.</li>
    <li> I have so much problems finding anything to help with my exceptionally dry skin.  This product is just okay... required 2 or 3 applications a day to really help me much.  I am a little disappointed because I love the idea of the pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> great stuff use it all the time</li>
    <li> I like this product so far</li>
    <li> normal everyday lotion nothing special full of chemicals</li>
    <li> Works great on my kid&#x27;s skin condition, now his skin is much smoother.  Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> It really helps the skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, very gently on your skin. This is not the really strong Alpha Hydroxy Acid that stings and tingles but still works. I had some minor scar marks in an area causing me problems that would not go away and after a couple of weeks they are fully gone and the area is softer/better than before. Sometimes you just have to shake the container too if nothing comes out do to air gaps.</li>
    <li> great stuff..I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> This would be good for some applications but you don&#x27;t want to use it on your face.  It contains mineral oil which causes my skin to break out and become very oily.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Acne.org&#x27;s AHA product but I failed in this case.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I am using everynight and takes off makeup easily!</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this product and was very disappointed considering the price. I would not buy this lotion again.</li>
    <li> IT IS CERTAINLY A GOOD AMOUNT FOR A GOOD PRICE BUT I EXPECTED MIRACLES, CLEAR SKIN RIGHT, AWAY AND IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK AS WELL AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD.  IT IS OK</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever. I use it daily and since I live in a very dry climate it&#x27;s necessary.  I use sunscreen over it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on 10/2014 for dry bumpy skin.  It was cheaper and bigger than Alpha Hydrox but not the same quality. It&#x27;s lotion, it moisturized but didn&#x27;t help a lot with the dry skin and bumpiness.  Lotion looked and felt very watered down and it did not penetrate the skin easily.  I would not buy this again I guess I&#x27;ll shed more money and order the Alpha Hydrox.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. To start off, since the product label does warn that it might make skin sensitive to sunlight I opted to use this as a night cream for my face and neck. The first week I did notice my skin was peeling in a suttle way. Currently my skin feels so soft and smooth, my face has brightened. I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product, and the price is great. I highly recommend it. I have been using this product for 2 weeks, I&#x27;m 27, my skin is normal.</li>
    <li> Light scent. Thick formula. Circular container.  It may burn on cuts or scratches.</li>
    <li> I have this product for about a month,  but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough. I have not seen any results. Next time I&#x27;ll order 14 percent.</li>
    <li> Love the large size and pump.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for me</li>
    <li> Not terrible, but very greasy.  Would not use on face.  Not sure how effective it is as I stopped using due to the greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Very very pleased. Worked better than I expected</li>
    <li> Love it!  I use this and Oz Naturals Vitamin C serum and I look 20 years younger than I am!  Will always use this.  I save so much money over Lancome products with a much better result.  I still use Lancome makeup and makeup remover.  I also use Oz Naturals eye serum.  I think the Oz Naturals serums have made the biggest improvement on my skin but Alpha Hydroxy creams and Vitamin C serums are proven to improve aging skin.  I am thrilled.  I&#x27;ve been using this combination for about 8 months I think.</li>
    <li> I bought it to even out my skin, i had a race and unfortunately forgot to but sun block. I think the product is ok , but nothing especial . it leave my hands pretty dry</li>
    <li> VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product about 7 days and already I can see and feel the difference in my skin particularly my feet.  After 50 years the skin on my feet started to be stiff and wrinkly.  People use to always tell me I had pretty feet.  So when my feet started to look old I knew I had to do something.  So I ordered this product along with Lactic Acid skin peel 85% and started using it 2 times a day.  My feet are on the fast track to the soft supple look that they once were.  I&#x27;m excited about using this product it really works.  I have to be careful about using it near my face because my eyes are very sensitive and will start to burn and swell.</li>
    <li> My skin is very oily this enhanced the oiliness to the very max. I look like a greased pig it makes my skin so much more oily. Tip for you guys at Advanced Clinicals get rid of the mineral oil its not good replace it or remove it. I broke out so much more thanks alot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few times now and can see a big improvement.  Pores are still large but small wrinkles are way smaller.  Not bad at all for price.  Can&#x27;t wait to use with micro needle.</li>
