      <li>Went on super easily and smoothly, worked perfectly.  </li>
      <li>The makeup holds up very well, and is very comfortable compared to others, and best of all, it washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because Steam Powered Giraffe raves about how smoothly this stuff mixes and how amazing the coverage is (if you need evidence of how amazing this can look, just check out some of their music videos), and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and It comes on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>You can use it as a powder all over your body, or you can use the mixer to make it into a paste and make it more waterproof.  </li>
      <li>covers well, one bottle could be used more than once.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality, easy to apply ... and was more than enough to paint my 10 year olds face, neck and arms for her tin woman costume.</li>
      <li>It dries very fast and very smooth and shiny!</li>
      <li>But it came off quite easily with some rubbing from a washcloth.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to remove with just soap and water.  </li>
      <li>We removed it easily with makeup wipes.</li>
      <li>Goes on very easy, does not rub off once dried, looks great, and washes off with soap and water very easy.  </li>
      <li>The product mixes easily and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Overall great</li>
      <li>It went on smooth and stayed on all day, even through dancing and sweating.</li>
      <li>Perfect product great price used this for my hollowed costume believe me a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>It was super metallic and was easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I have a pretty prominent tattoo on my arm</li>
      <li>Even better, it really does come off with soap and water!</li>
      <li>wow ok so I ordered this on a monday and it arrived that wendsday!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this is one of the easiest special effects makeup products I&#x27;ve worked with.</li>
      <li>With a little patience (and a lot of practice with shading), you can achieve incredible results with this</li>
      <li>Nice thick coverage and good shine.</li>
      <li>Man it SMELLS super metallic.</li>
      <li>However, I could not stop sneezing and had watery eyes after I used it, which is exactly what happens to me when I have a mild allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>Works awesome both wet and dry!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really silver metallic!</li>
      <li>Works very well!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>Thick paint and looks great.  </li>
      <li>my whole head), neck, and most of my chest, and still have enough powder and liquid left to do it probably a dozen more times (or more).&lt;br</li>
      <li>We live on guam (super hot humid tropical weather) and my husband was the Tin man for Halloween and even in 90* weather it didn&#x27;t run.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very shiny, pretty, and durable paint.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pure metal look.</li>
      <li>Hard to take off but easy to put on. :3</li>
      <li>Very shiny and stays on REALLY well.</li>
      <li>works very well and is as pictured.</li>
      <li>did two whole faces and i still have tons</li>
      <li>I painted my whole head (not just my face...</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge, dries fast, doesn&#x27;t crack or crease.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s touch to layer other makeup on top, but that adds to the staying power.  </li>
      <li>But seriously, it looks REALLY COOL!!!</li>
      <li>This silver paint goes on so smooth, and goes a long way!</li>
      <li>This went on perfectly metallic and dried nicely so that I was able to apply other makeup effects to the metallic base.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Wow!!</li>
      <li>Just a little bit of dust and mixing liquid are enough for most make up uses.</li>
      <li>Order extra mixing liquid if you&#x27;re covering your whole body.  </li>
      <li>(I do have sensitive skin).</li>
      <li>a warning to sensitive skin people.</li>
      <li>and it covered it completely with one coat.  </li>
      <li>I used just a fraction of the powder/mixing liquid to cover my actors face, and it stayed on for nearly three hours with no need for reapplication.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, I really recommend this item, because it did a very well job.</li>
      <li>It was so easy to mix with the liquid and paint on with a small paintbrush.</li>
      <li>My son played the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz in his high school musical.  </li>
      <li>It dried pretty much immediately and was definitely water resistant.  </li>
      <li>spent several hours putting on makeup for the last show I attended, and was absolutely blown away by how easy the Mehron was to apply and blend with the black creme eyeliner I was using for shading.</li>
      <li>At first i didnt think it would be enough, but a little powder mixed with the sealer goes a long way, Ive painted my full face and neck three times with it and still have plenty.</li>
      <li>I like Mehron in general, but I&#x27;d never tried their metallic powders-</li>
      <li>* if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
      <li>discovered that you can get several different looks by changing the concentration of powder - it can look like heavy metal or a light silver coating.</li>
      <li>it certainly measures up to their other products.  </li>
      <li>im giving it 5 stars because of the fast delivery and the quality of the makeup but the picture is a little misleading even though it doesnt say you get the 1oz bottle</li>

    <li> I used this for my Winter Soldier costume and I loved it.  I have a pretty prominent tattoo on my arm and it covered it completely with one coat.  It dried pretty much immediately and was definitely water resistant.  I would definitely recommend this paint.</li>
    <li> Perfect product great price used this for my hollowed costume believe me a little goes a long way did two whole faces and i still have tons</li>
    <li> So this thing deserves 4 1/2 stars. When you mix it with the mixing liquid it goes on perfectly!!! It dries and then stays on really great. I saw it on an awesome YouTube tutorial, and decided to try it out for the LOJ ball in August.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why the missing star? Man it SMELLS super metallic. I scrubbed it off after only trying it on for maybe an hour. It came off with some work, but I could still smell it!!! Then I broke out the next day (I do have sensitive skin). Once it dried it stayed on tight, but it felt like my skin was tight like I was wearing a clay mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a warning to sensitive skin people. But seriously, it looks REALLY COOL!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff was AMAZING!! We live on guam (super hot humid tropical weather) and my husband was the Tin man for Halloween and even in 90* weather it didn&#x27;t run. It even rained on us and didn&#x27;t run!! But it came off quite easily with some rubbing from a washcloth. Only piece of advice: mix it in a disposable container because I let it dry and it took a bit of effort to scrub it out.</li>
    <li> Works awesome both wet and dry!</li>
    <li> This face paint was excellent.  Went on super easily and smoothly, worked perfectly.  Thick paint and looks great.  I mixed just a tiny bit to do half of my face and still have a lot left.</li>
    <li> This is GREAT!!! It&#x27;s super shiny and beautifully metallic and stays on for hours.  Once it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s sealed and it&#x27;s touch to layer other makeup on top, but that adds to the staying power.  Absolutely awesome!!</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for thank you I will be buying more of this product again! 5 stars of goodness!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because Steam Powered Giraffe raves about how smoothly this stuff mixes and how amazing the coverage is (if you need evidence of how amazing this can look, just check out some of their music videos), and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I spent several hours putting on makeup for the last show I attended, and was absolutely blown away by how easy the Mehron was to apply and blend with the black creme eyeliner I was using for shading. The makeup lasted through the entire show (I was amazed that it didn&#x27;t sweat off at all, unlike other face paints I&#x27;ve used in the past), dinner afterward, and the four hour drive home. With a little patience (and a lot of practice with shading), you can achieve incredible results with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few tries the first time around to get the proportions right, but a little powder goes a LONG way. I painted my whole head (not just my face... my whole head), neck, and most of my chest, and still have enough powder and liquid left to do it probably a dozen more times (or more).&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this silky powder? It does get *everywhere* if you&#x27;re not careful. My advice would be to do your makeup, then change into whatever outfit you&#x27;re going to be wearing it with, if you have the option. And I&#x27;d avoid doing your painting in the car, because it&#x27;s not fun, you end up with powder on your clothes and the car, and obviously it&#x27;s difficult to get straight/consistent lines.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm for Halloween when my boyfriend wanted to go with robot paint on his face. This went on perfectly metallic and dried nicely so that I was able to apply other makeup effects to the metallic base. This paint stayed on all night long through a work shift. My only complaint is that it was so hard to get off, I think we took a layer of skin off with all the scrubbing we did to remove the stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Tin Man costume, and it was just perfect.  I like Mehron in general, but I&#x27;d never tried their metallic powders- it certainly measures up to their other products.  I used just a fraction of the powder/mixing liquid to cover my actors face, and it stayed on for nearly three hours with no need for reapplication.  We removed it easily with makeup wipes.</li>
    <li> loved this product for out tin man</li>
    <li> We bought this to use instead of a mask for a cyborg costume. It worked perfectly! It was so easy to mix with the liquid and paint on with a small paintbrush. It went on smooth and stayed on all day, even through dancing and sweating. Even better, it really does come off with soap and water! It also comes out of clothing easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered that you can get several different looks by changing the concentration of powder - it can look like heavy metal or a light silver coating. You can even just rub the powder onto your skin for a gray effect with a silver sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We let the metal coat dry and then added details with a black eyeliner pencil. I recommend spraying the finished makeup with a setting spray to lock it all in place. In one of our test runs we didn&#x27;t use the setting spray and the metal started shedding tiny silver flakes. The flaking didn&#x27;t affect the look of the makeup on the face at all, it just looked like silver dandruff on the shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this is one of the easiest special effects makeup products I&#x27;ve worked with. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this expecting the larger bottle in the image, but instead got a small little thing that hasn&#x27;t lasted very long. The product is great, but yeah.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, easy to apply ... and was more than enough to paint my 10 year olds face, neck and arms for her tin woman costume. It looked great ... and I was really impressed with the quality.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this in her make up class.  She loves the way it looks and feels.</li>
    <li> wow ok so I ordered this on a monday and it arrived that wendsday! days before the earliest estimated arrival date! im giving it 5 stars because of the fast delivery and the quality of the makeup but the picture is a little misleading even though it doesnt say you get the 1oz bottle, the picture makes you think you get it...but its still great! cant wait to take pictures of my Rabbit cosplay from Stam Powered Giraffe :D</li>
    <li> This goes on very easily. It stayed on all day even when my fiance sweat a little. It&#x27;s a pure metal look. Excellent product. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My son played the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz in his high school musical.  It was super metallic and was easy to use.  It had excellent coverage. Easy to remove with just soap and water.  We got lots of compliments on his Tin Man look!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing with or without using the medium. A little goes a looooong way. I used less than an 1/8 of a teaspoon to cover half of a large face. Doesn&#x27;t smudge, dries fast, doesn&#x27;t crack or crease. Love it.</li>
    <li> Goes on very easy, does not rub off once dried, looks great, and washes off with soap and water very easy.  Order extra mixing liquid if you&#x27;re covering your whole body.  There&#x27;s plenty of powder, but not enough mixing liquid.</li>
    <li> I ordered the metallic powder in silver and I received a gold powder with no mixing liquid. I even checked the packaging and it said silver with mixing liquid, but on the bottle it said gold.... boo</li>
    <li> Used this for tin man make-up. Awesome.  Nice thick coverage and good shine.</li>
    <li> This is a great set to have for making airbrush makeup and much more. I will always choose Mehron. GREAT!</li>
    <li> I received mine for use with a costume i wore to a convention, and i was very pleased with the result. Upon opening the package i found a pretty small bottle of powder and sealer, the powder no bigger than your avarage nail polish. At first i didnt think it would be enough, but a little powder mixed with the sealer goes a long way, Ive painted my full face and neck three times with it and still have plenty. The makeup holds up very well, and is very comfortable compared to others, and best of all, it washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very shiny, pretty, and durable paint. I wore it all day long at a convention, and when I came home it was still in place. Just a little bit of dust and mixing liquid are enough for most make up uses. However, I could not stop sneezing and had watery eyes after I used it, which is exactly what happens to me when I have a mild allergic reaction. So I would recommend people buying this item to think it twice if they are prone to allergies. Other than that, I really recommend this item, because it did a very well job.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend was the tin man for Halloween. The product mixes easily and goes on smoothly. It&#x27;s really silver metallic! My boyfriend&#x27;s skin looked like chrome metal and this stayed on all night!! The best part, it came off easily and did not stain his skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff was amazing.  I wore it all day on my face and it didn&#x27;t smudge, crack or fade.  Very cool stuff!</li>
    <li> Wow!! This stuff is NO JOKE!  I purchased it to go to a Robot theme party and it did not disappoint!!  You can use it as a powder all over your body, or you can use the mixer to make it into a paste and make it more waterproof.  Either way this thing did not run, and did not sweat off after dancing all night.  Taking it off was really easy too! I just took a shower and it came off with soap and water.  I just purchased the gold one just to have.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Amazing pigment, very happy.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Easy to apply and the silver color was perfect.</li>
    <li> covers well, one bottle could be used more than once. Overall great (I used it for a tin man costume and got lots of compliments on it.)</li>
    <li> This silver paint goes on so smooth, and goes a long way! It dries very fast and very smooth and shiny!</li>
    <li> works very well and is as pictured. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works very well! I break out when I use it though but otherwise it works very nicely and It comes on very smoothly. Hard to take off but easy to put on. :3</li>
    <li> Very shiny and stays on REALLY well. Almost too well. I couldn&#x27;t wash it off with water and had to remove it with makeup removed. I think that&#x27;s a pro and a con.</li>
</ol>
