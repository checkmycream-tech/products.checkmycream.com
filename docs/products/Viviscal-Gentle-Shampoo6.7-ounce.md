      <li>After I started using the shampoo and conditionerr i noticed an even better results!  </li>
      <li>Great shampoo - doesn&#x27;t lather well unless you use a substantial amount, but it works really well and leaves my hair looking great.</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves your hair feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>This may not be suitable for those who are looking for shampoos that softens hair.</li>
      <li>Feels clean and smells good.</li>
      <li>and she couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
      <li>The condictioner is way better than the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I need to restock :)</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m honestly only subscribing to this product along with the shampoo because it&#x27;s recommended that these two products be used in conjunction with the oral supplements because work best when used together.</li>
      <li>My hair is getting more brittle with age,</li>
      <li>Love it and feel like my hair is feeling healthier and thicker.  </li>
      <li>Great product, fast shipping</li>
      <li>It was ok...</li>
      <li>You can also see my review on the viviscal tablets and how those too are a rip off and save lots of money and get better results with going prenatal.</li>
      <li>Have to say the shampoo is great - made my hair feel really soft (since I have color and bleach).  </li>
      <li>I use this with the conditioner and vitamins and biotin and my hair has been growing very quickly.</li>
      <li>the shampoo has a funny smell to it- kind of like a soy sauce smell.</li>
      <li>Taking that ingredient out really makes the difference for many of us!</li>
      <li>Gentle on the hair and thickens nicely.</li>
      <li>It leaves her hair clean, silky and easy to comb after the shower.  </li>
      <li>What good is a product that is supposed to help you to grow better hair when all it does is damage your current hair?  </li>
      <li>BUT it is worth it!  </li>
      <li>It also can be very drying, so be sure to get the Viviscal Moisturizing Conditioner with it.</li>
      <li>This product is really effective and better than I expected.  </li>
      <li>I love it and will most likely buy it again.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The shampoo has the consistency of water and runs right through your fingers.</li>
      <li>For those of you that don&#x27;t know, full, thick beautiful hair is a great perk of pregnancy and this shampoo and conditioner has cut down on her hair loss, which was frequent at times.  </li>
      <li>Although I think this product might be effective over time, I am also going to try other products.</li>
      <li>Clean formula lathers well taking it with Viviscal Professional supplement.</li>
      <li>Viviscal Gentle Shampoo leaves my hair soft, clean and shiny</li>
      <li>samething I said about the conditioner, I Highly recommend it to anyone wanting to grow healthy long hair.</li>
      <li>It is hard to tell if it has really made much difference since hair-growth cycles take time, but it is a good shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have tried Viviscal shampoo before, but not the gentle shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It poured out like water, so I thought I used too much, however, it did not produce a lot of lather.  </li>
      <li>I dont really see a difference with this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really say this is a moisturizering conditioner</li>
      <li>, I really like using it.</li>
      <li>However I will state this much at this point, my hair does not fall out as much, but I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of knew growth.</li>
      <li>Really makes my hair look fuller.</li>
      <li>I use the Viviscal vitamins and love them, however the shampoo and conditioner were extremely drying to my color treated hair.</li>
      <li>I can not determine if it&#x27;s better than any other shampoos.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like that this doesn&#x27;t lather and left my hair not feeling clean after I worked out.</li>
      <li>The shampoo did not come with a seal under the top, but I am not going to make any accusations of it being watered down before purchasing another one and see if there is a difference in consistency.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and she has been very pleased with the product and all it promised to do, it delivered.  </li>
      <li>She would highly recommend for any hair type, as her&#x27;s is long, straight and colored.  </li>
      <li>As far as the supplements are concerned, it&#x27;s too early to comment on their efficacy.</li>
      <li>and I really need a formula that cleanses deep.</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo just once, only to have my fine hair turn into a matted mess of snarls, impenetrable by a detangling comb.  </li>
      <li>This product, and its counterpart conditioner, are dangerous for fine or baby fine hair.  </li>
      <li>There are no strong scents but a clean smell.  </li>
      <li>I use other shampoo first then use this.</li>
      <li>, only flaw is it is very watery, so I think that I waste the product trying to figure out how much to use.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s too expensive to have to use an abundant amount.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner is effective, although a little hard to get out of the bottle.</li>

<li> Together they make my hair a little fuller looking, and with my very fine, thin hair, that&#x27;s a plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell any difference yet.</li>
<li> sorry to admit, and this makes it SO full and wavy/curly!  </li>
<li> Left my hair dry.  </li>
<li> It goes a long way!</li>
<li> At first I was going to purchase them in pill form to take but read some people had side effects of bad acne, so decided to try the shampoo first.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry or greasy either.</li>
<li> However, it seems to dry my hair</li>
<li> These are 15 minutes of my life that I am not getting back, not to mention my wasted money on this product.  </li>
<li> My hair is clean but it is a little expensive.</li>
<li> but I am not sure that it actually makes a difference.  </li>
<li> not worth the price</li>
<li> While I noticed no decrease in hair loss, I found it impossible to get any lather from this shampoo until applying it for the third time, and we have soft water!  </li>
<li> Trust me this is a waste of money.</li>
<li> It feels sticky and makes my hair limp.</li>
<li> When oil and waste piles up, it usually leads to hair thinness and loss</li>
<li> Cheaper than in the store, but expensive for such dubious results.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is working or not.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t lather, my hair was hard to brush.</li>
<li> It is expensive per the small bottle</li>
<li> Used twice, but can&#x27;t get past the bad smell of product, both shampoo &amp; conditioner smells like old chemical.&lt;br /&gt;Smells too bad to keep using or to know if it will even work now.</li>
<li> the plastic bottles are hard making it  difficult in squeezing product out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The shampoo also makes hair look thicker, I take their pills and use the shampoo</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement with the shampoo. i&#x27;m taking the supplements simultaneously too. the shampoo has a funny smell to it- kind of like a soy sauce smell.</li>
    <li> What good is a product that is supposed to help you to grow better hair when all it does is damage your current hair?  This product, and its counterpart conditioner, are dangerous for fine or baby fine hair.  I used this shampoo just once, only to have my fine hair turn into a matted mess of snarls, impenetrable by a detangling comb.  Even after using a tried-and-true deep conditioner/detangler, it still took me over 15 minutes to comb out my chin-length hair.  These are 15 minutes of my life that I am not getting back, not to mention my wasted money on this product.  I do not recommend this product or its counterpart conditioner, which I had tried separately. The  conditioner actually causes the same tangle/matting issue.  Proceed with caution.</li>
    <li> Great product for my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> While I noticed no decrease in hair loss, I found it impossible to get any lather from this shampoo until applying it for the third time, and we have soft water!  The shampoo has the consistency of water and runs right through your fingers.</li>
    <li> Just don&#x27;t like it. not worth the price</li>
    <li> not what I wanted.  would not buy again.  Left my hair dry.  That is why i bought this shampoo and I was losing my hair.</li>
    <li> My Mom has been using this for over a month now and reports that she feels her hair to be thicker...Beyond that, it is moisturizing and smells great!</li>
    <li> I dont really see a difference with this shampoo. I will start using my regular shampoo this week I am also taking the pills for about a month also I still dont see any changes</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really say this is a moisturizering conditioner, I&#x27;m honestly only subscribing to this product along with the shampoo because it&#x27;s recommended that these two products be used in conjunction with the oral supplements because work best when used together. As far as the supplements are concerned, it&#x27;s too early to comment on their efficacy. I believe packet inserts states results may start showing after 3 months of consecutive use and I&#x27;m only 7 weeks into taking supplements. However I will state this much at this point, my hair does not fall out as much, but I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of knew growth. Remember this product only claims it aid in re growth of existing hair follicles, not to grow hair where there is already permanent baldness.</li>
    <li> Does not suds at all.  I use other shampoo first then use this.</li>
    <li> This is good for cleansing oily scalp like myself. When oil and waste piles up, it usually leads to hair thinness and loss and I really need a formula that cleanses deep. It plays a great role in that field. This may not be suitable for those who are looking for shampoos that softens hair.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Vivascal vitamins with incredible results.  After I started using the shampoo and conditionerr i noticed an even better results!  I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo and conditioner for several months.It is hard to tell if it has really made much difference since hair-growth cycles take time, but it is a good shampoo. The conditioner is effective, although a little hard to get out of the bottle. Although I think this product might be effective over time, I am also going to try other products.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  My hair is getting more brittle with age, sorry to admit, and this makes it SO full and wavy/curly!  It is expensive per the small bottle BUT it is worth it!  I love that it is sulfate-free!  Taking that ingredient out really makes the difference for many of us!</li>
    <li> This product is really effective and better than I expected.  I purchased the shampoo to use with the Viviscal vitamins.  Started seeing results within two weeks and after three months, I am a believer.</li>
    <li> It was ok... I did not notice any difference, but still using it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell any difference yet. But I do like the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Used twice, but can&#x27;t get past the bad smell of product, both shampoo &amp; conditioner smells like old chemical.&lt;br /&gt;Smells too bad to keep using or to know if it will even work now.</li>
    <li> Viviscal Gentle Shampoo leaves my hair soft, clean and shiny, I really like using it.</li>
    <li> I use the Viviscal vitamins and love them, however the shampoo and conditioner were extremely drying to my color treated hair. Would not recommend or purchase this again.  Actually threw it away.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great shampoo - doesn&#x27;t lather well unless you use a substantial amount, but it works really well and leaves my hair looking great.</li>
    <li> Clean formula lathers well taking it with Viviscal Professional supplement.</li>
    <li> I swear by Viviscal products.  Gentle on the hair and thickens nicely. Try it!</li>
    <li> Hair is growing. The only thing I am displeased is that it doesn&#x27;t lather.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> At first I was going to purchase them in pill form to take but read some people had side effects of bad acne, so decided to try the shampoo first.  Have to say the shampoo is great - made my hair feel really soft (since I have color and bleach).  Love it and feel like my hair is feeling healthier and thicker.  Definitely will purchase the conditioner now</li>
    <li> I like this product. It seemed to make my hair fuller and shinier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is working or not. I&#x27;m on my 5th month of taking this medication, and I think I am starting to see improvement. Cheaper than in the store, but expensive for such dubious results.</li>
    <li> The condictioner is way better than the shampoo. Too watery. So, I imagine that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
    <li> samething I said about the conditioner, I Highly recommend it to anyone wanting to grow healthy long hair. I need to restock :) I Love, Love, Love It!!!!!</li>
    <li> I gave this shampoo a try but I am not sure that it actually makes a difference.  It did not hurt though.  My hair is clean but it is a little expensive.</li>
    <li> The product worked well as a shampoo.  I can not determine if it&#x27;s better than any other shampoos.</li>
    <li> Same things as with the conditioner, it had to results w/my hair. Didn&#x27;t lather, my hair was hard to brush.</li>
    <li> Shampoo doen&#x27;t lather nor does it feel like it&#x27;s cleaning your hair properly and the plastic bottles are hard making it  difficult in squeezing product out.</li>
    <li> It smells great and leaves your hair feeling clean.  I love it and will most likely buy it again.  I use this with the conditioner and vitamins and biotin and my hair has been growing very quickly.</li>
    <li> It goes a long way! It also can be very drying, so be sure to get the Viviscal Moisturizing Conditioner with it. Together they make my hair a little fuller looking, and with my very fine, thin hair, that&#x27;s a plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B009ZRFKZ4 Viviscal Moisturizing Conditioner,6.7 ounce]]</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like that this doesn&#x27;t lather and left my hair not feeling clean after I worked out. Plus, it was so fluid it felt like it was all water.</li>
    <li> My wife read about this shampoo and conditioner in a pregnancy magazine and it said it would help maintain your hair afterwards.  I bought it for her to begin using during the end of her pregnancy and she couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  For those of you that don&#x27;t know, full, thick beautiful hair is a great perk of pregnancy and this shampoo and conditioner has cut down on her hair loss, which was frequent at times.  It leaves her hair clean, silky and easy to comb after the shower.  She can&#x27;t wait to see how well it works after she has the baby.  There are no strong scents but a clean smell.  A little goes a long way and she has been very pleased with the product and all it promised to do, it delivered.  She would highly recommend for any hair type, as her&#x27;s is long, straight and colored.  She uses both the Shampoo and Conditioner and she would recommend the combination.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry or greasy either.</li>
    <li> Always have a good hair day with this shampoo.  Will be buying again</li>
    <li> Really makes my hair look fuller.</li>
    <li> Trust me this is a waste of money. Just take prenatal vitamins and any women who has had a baby can tell you, it will do wonders not just for you hair, but also your eye lashes, skin, and nails. You can also see my review on the viviscal tablets and how those too are a rip off and save lots of money and get better results with going prenatal.</li>
    <li> This is very good shampoo. I like the way my scalp feels, only flaw is it is very watery, so I think that I waste the product trying to figure out how much to use.  Again in spite of this it is a very good product, and you cannot beat Amazons price.</li>
    <li> I have used Viviscal shampoo for about a month and my hair seems healthier.</li>
    <li> It feels sticky and makes my hair limp.</li>
    <li> I used both the shampoo and the conditioner for 6 weeks because I thought it would do my hair good.  However, it seems to dry my hair and I have difficulty getting a comb through it after washing.  I feel as though I am tearing my hair, so have stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I have tried Viviscal shampoo before, but not the gentle shampoo.  It poured out like water, so I thought I used too much, however, it did not produce a lot of lather.  I think it&#x27;s too expensive to have to use an abundant amount.  The shampoo did not come with a seal under the top, but I am not going to make any accusations of it being watered down before purchasing another one and see if there is a difference in consistency.</li>
    <li> Love it. Doesn&#x27;t fade my hair coloring.  Feels clean and smells good.</li>
</ol>
