      <li>Okay, so I was looking all over for some good clippers.  </li>
      <li>I am trimming my own hair for over 10 years, I do not have a salon or shop</li>
      <li>I bought the QC5055 to use on my partner&#x27;s hair, since I was accustomed to going to a salon for my own haircuts.</li>
      <li>The build quality is really nice, as well.</li>
      <li>The design and engineering of this product are just nice.</li>
      <li>It will also operate in either corded or cordless mode, handy when the battery dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and he liked them as well, and couldn&#x27;t believe the price (the ones he uses are around 300</li>
      <li>Norelco should have provided some kind of case or bag to keep all parts together.</li>
      <li>I am 5&#x27;6\\&quot; and about 200 pounds and it fits in my hand nicely.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was happy to see that you could clean these clippers under a running faucet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other than the surprising ease of use and operation and the quality of the haircut, I liked the easy cleaning and maintenance and the fact that, if needed, it can operate in a &#x27;corded&#x27; mode.</li>
      <li>They do full charge and work great.  </li>

      <li>UNIT IS A GREAT CLIPPER, STAYS CHARGED A LONG TIME AND CUTS VERY GOOD.</li>
      <li>Using that, with the plastic comb removed, I was able to trim a nice arc around the curve of his ears.     </li>
      <li>It would have come in handy, although I am sure people would do that</li>
      <li>and I must say that this is the best one i&#x27;ve seen so far in the U.S.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice to be able to use these clippers on my beard as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My partner&#x27;s hair is very fine, and his hairline is receding, but what hair he has is densely populated on his scalp.</li>
      <li>Broke too easily!</li>
      <li>I have been even more pleased and impressed with this new one, the QC5055.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s quick and easy to clean and (best of all)</li>
      <li>Surprisingly with the appropriate attachement I was able to take inches off of length and thickness quite easily.  </li>
      <li>It made it a lot easier to get a good clean result when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about working around the cord and was able to shave my friend&#x27;s head very easily.  </li>

      <li>Thicker hair might need a bit more juice to make a quicker shave.</li>
      <li>My fear is that a chunk of hair might trim shorter because they move letting more in then supposed to.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After charging we were able to use it once and had to charge again.  </li>
      <li>and I seem to be able to control it better</li>

      <li>My husband loves the fact that there isn&#x27;t too many accessories.</li>
      <li>I got this as a gift and was very happy at the job it did, the charge lasted more than enough time to finish.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is an aggravation saving device.  I have a 14 year old boy, his hair gets oily, stringy and needs clippers every so often.  Times are tough, so it&#x27;s not too cost effective to take him in for a little trim to clean up his hair.  Of course I have a set of standard plug in clippers, but I&#x27;m not satisfied with the heavy buzz while they&#x27;re in use.  Then I have to maneuver around his head with the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product -- no problems.  It&#x27;s rechargeable with no cord, and it works on his head like a champ.</li>
    <li> Yes... I know this is sold as a hair clipper, but let&#x27;s talk about beards for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About five years ago, Philips Norelco decided to tinker with the designs on their beard trimmers. My favorite brand went from making excellent products, to gimmicky \\&quot;oh look, it has a vacuum and LCD!\\&quot; junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product restores my faith in Philips Norelco. Right off the bat, it has some decent weight to it, making it easy to maneuver. The guard clips stay on quite well (compared to other P-N clippers), and the motor is just great. The build quality is really nice, as well. There isn&#x27;t nearly as much creaky \\&quot;push it the wrong way and it&#x27;ll snap\\&quot; plastic as I&#x27;ve seen on previous models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it&#x27;s power hungry. I&#x27;ve been getting a few days out of it as a beard trimmer, but that&#x27;s compared to at least a week or more with other cordless trimmers I&#x27;ve used. So if you&#x27;re going away for more than a night, you&#x27;ll probably want to bring the power cord with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, if I were in the market for a beard trimmer, this is what I&#x27;d buy.</li>
    <li> I picked this up intending to save money on haircuts, but in the end went back to the neighborhood barber.  Instead, I used this as a beard trimmer, and it performs that way admirably.  The device cuts through the beard wonderfully, with variable heights and smooth action.  While it lacks the vacuum accessory that makes other cleaner, it is far more precise and easy to handle than its competitors.  Using this device will get you a quicker, more precise trim than any of the competitors I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  The attachments are a little fragile but in general it is much better than the Wahl.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco QC5055 clipper works wonderful if you do not have thick and full hair or do extensive hair cutting. It is good for maintaining a short haircut or shaving a beard. However, if you have lots of hair, I recommend a traditional clipper due to a wider cutting area and sheer power. The unit feels solid and heavy, but the plastics are a little on the cheap side. The cordless feature is convenient, especially if you cut your hair outside. No more extension cords. On the downside, rechargeability makes the unit lack in cutting power at times and you need to manage a separate charging base. Overall for the price, this is a good unit, just don&#x27;t expect professional salon quality cuts and build quality.</li>
    <li> I was looking at this as an extension to the [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver]].  Not really its intended purpose but it does work pretty well in that role as long as you are careful.  Emphasis on the being careful; it can, and will, grab loose skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with it.  It cuts through hair quickly and easily making it easy for quick touch up trims.  It&#x27;s also fairly quiet, much quieter than my electric shaver so it doesn&#x27;t affect my hearing when trimming sideburns and hair that&#x27;s grown longer than my ears.  It will also operate in either corded or cordless mode, handy when the battery dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a few negatives from my view:&lt;br /&gt;-The charging LED in the handle does not shut off when the unit is charged.  It is lit the entire time it&#x27;s plugged in.  Little annoying considering almost very rechargeable device will let you know when it has completed charging.&lt;br /&gt;- It does not charge at the same time you are using it while plugged in.  Not really a big deal, just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;- Only the head portion can be rinsed; the base / battery can not get wet.  Again, not really a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;- Hair trimmings get stuck in the lubricant grease inside the head.  Not a lot, only a few very small pieces, but if you&#x27;re a perfectionist it can be a little aggravating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m expecting this will also work well to trim out the tufts of overgrown toe fur that my cat gets.  I can, and do, trim with scissors periodically but it takes a bit of time due to being careful.  The longer it takes the more annoyed he gets.  Using this I should be able to trim the fur much quicker so he gets less annoyed.  Less annoyed cat &#x3D;&#x3D; less annoyed human.  We both win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Dec 1, 2010&lt;br /&gt;15 months later and I&#x27;m still using this.  Does a fantastic job of keeping the hair around my ears trimmed just enough so that it isn&#x27;t touching or rubbing.  Very quick and quiet.  It still irks me a little bit that it doesn&#x27;t tell you when charging is complete.  The other nitpicks I&#x27;ve gotten over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say how well it works on trimming toe fur on a long haired cat.  The shaver is in one room and when I see that he needs a trim we&#x27;re in a different one.  I did use it once to snip out some matted up fur and it did a decent job.n&#x27;t tell you when charging is complete.

    <li> There was a time when I spent money on haircuts.  But in college, I realized that I could have one of roommates cut my hair with a set of clippers that cost the same amount as a single cut.  Since then, I&#x27;ve duped various people into cutting my hair (it helps that my hair is fairly easy to cut).  And over the years, I&#x27;ve owned a number of hair clippers but this Norelco is without a doubt the best one I&#x27;ve used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cordless - All of the units that I&#x27;ve owned to date needed to be plugged in while cutting.  This unit, lets you unplug if you need to which is really useful if you don&#x27;t want to stick a cord in someone&#x27;s face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Clicking Clipper Settings - Instead of having to remove a particular numbered guard and adding on a new one, this clipper lets to slide the guard to a new length.  I realize that there are other units that have this features, but I think that it is really useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Handling - Unlike some of the really heavy Wahl units I&#x27;ve used in the past, this clipper is light and thin.  It is much easier to wield than other ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy to clean - The unit comes apart really easily which makes clean up a snap.</li>
    <li> Good overall ,but not when using wireless. It&#x27;s too weak. One overnight Charge is enough to shave only 1.5 legs (forget about head haircut/do).&lt;br /&gt;Battery is the worst,but with wall plug it will do any job easier.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing though if ur doing any cutting/shaving-it&#x27;s pain free,it doesn&#x27;t rip out your hair follicles;)&lt;br /&gt;One star fell out of the battery quality;(</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself is OK, though my hair tends to clog the cutting head when the guide comb is attached, forcing me to detach, shake and re-attach the guide comb. The charge holds for about 30 minutes before it starts to slow down.  My biggest criticism is the flimsy plastic \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; of the guide combs: they flex too much and both times that I&#x27;ve used it (the second time being extra careful not to push down too hard on it) it cut my hair too short in one spot that caused me to have to cut the rest of my hair shorter than planned using the stubble attachment.  The stubble attachment is meant for beards, not heads.  This happened with the smaller guide comb, the longer one is even flimsier.    I won&#x27;t be returning it as I don&#x27;t have any of the packaging, but I will be looking for another one.</li>
    <li> I use this clipper with no combs i.e. &#x27;bald&#x27; settings.  I&#x27;ve been using hair clippers for a few years now on a weekly basis. I&#x27;ve come to the U.S. recently and I must say that this is the best one i&#x27;ve seen so far in the U.S. that is cordless. I used to have a Panasonic cordless clipper on European voltage that was (much) better but here this is the best one i&#x27;ve tried (two others have been returned).    A few points:  * charging time is long and there is no indication when the clipper is fully charged.  * power level is good although it tends to decrease already on the 2nd or 3rd use if not charged. This is not so great comparing to my previous one which lasted at least 4-5 uses before charged. This is a minor issue though because when it&#x27;s to &#x27;weak&#x27; it can be used as a corded device.  * cleaning is simple and the detachable knife is a nice feature  * if you don&#x27;t use the combs, the &#x27;0&#x27; knife is not as close as I would want. However this is again a minor issue.    If you are like me, looking for a cordless clipper so you can easily and safely cut your hair in the shower, this is a very good option at a reasonable price. After some bad experience with a leading American brand I find this a very good clipper.</li>
    <li> My previous trimmers were all corded, but this Philips is cordless (or corded). It uses a NiMH battery pack, which means there&#x27;s no memory effect and you&#x27;ll get more than 1 year of use out of it (versus NiCd which is a horrible battery chemistry that some cordless devices still use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It includes 3 different trimmer guides, 2 of which are fully adjustable. This prevents the need to keep 15 different guides. Unfortunately, the adjustment is difficult to use. I had trouble increasing the depth because of how the thumb button was designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself is very sleek and unique. It comes apart into 2 pieces for easy cleaning. The battery pack is the bottom half while the upper half houses the motor, transmission, and blades. Unfortunately, the trimmer does not stand upright by itself. It would have come in handy, although I am sure people would do that and it&#x27;d fall onto the ground, hence why Philips designed it to lay flat on a table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives of the trimmer are far and few. The blades are very noisy, and there&#x27;s no full charge indicator. The LED ring just glows RED to indicate it is charging or fully charged. The trimmer also does not include a pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is the right price and offers the same functions as a normal corded Wahl trimmer but without as many guides. The only drawback is that the guides aren&#x27;t as easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: NiMH battery pack, simple to clean and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Noisy, trimming guides aren&#x27;t that easy to use.</li>
    <li> Now I can do my haircut by myself. Everything is as expected. A little bit noisy and flimsy but I was warned by other reviewers.</li>
    <li> The design and portability of product is great.  It works great cutting some hairs but not all.  When I used this on my kids, this is a perfect hair clipper.  I have the freedom moving around as my kids are moving constantly. It&#x27;s super easy to clean after each use.  The design and engineering of this product are just nice. The integrated guide combs are adjustable for different cutting lengths and smooth on skin. However, I just wish some mechanical parts are made from a little more durable material like stainless steel and more powerful. Due to the light duty of the product (mostly plastic except the cutting blades) and it runs on weak batter power, I can&#x27;t move the clipper as quickly as other cord clippers.  When I used this on myself, it got stuck serveral times at first. This forced me to go really slow and got smaller cut at a time. And I don&#x27;t have a lot of hairs. So, I would imagine this will not work well on some thicker, harder hairs.  Bottom line is this is a good product to have on the go (specically for camping) and for kids&#x27; hair cutting.  But not so much with adults hairs.  So don&#x27;t thow away your cord clipper just yet.</li>
    <li> Althought this clipper is awesomely designed to fit your hand, it also does the job in a very effective way. I love it and would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I was looking all over for some good clippers.  I&#x27;m in college and it has been both annoying and expensive to cross campus and drop 16 bucks every month on a haircut.  I was looking at the Wohl and Osters on Amazon as well as others.  This one was a good brand, reasonable price, and free shipping.  So I went with it.  I had trouble deciding on whether to spring for an oster over this one, but im glad I bought it.    1) This is much better than the Wahl and very minimal parts to carry around  2) The body is heavy metal covered in a rubberized grib  3) Cordless   4) Not only for short buzzes.  Goes up to 1.6 inches.  5) Very reasonable price. Pays for itself in 2 uses.    My only concern/cons are     1) Flimsy guards.  The plastic bends a bit, but that doesn&#x27;t take much away from the value, just don&#x27;t press like a crazy person and you should be fine!  2) Battery dying. I read a review saying this occurred to them, and they just use it plugged in now.    I gave myself a cut last week in the bathroom and it took about 25min to get the hang of it. I was able to even do the back with no help!  It was super convenient, so if your looking for a way to give yourself frequent haircuts, look no further and go for the norelco!</li>
    <li> I had a similar one before. It was in a nice case and easy to store and carry along. It also had a vcd to show how to use it. So when I got this new one, it was pretty easy for me to figure out how to use it and design a style. However I guess it could have been better if it came with the vcd.     This clipper works perfectly. easy to adjust the length, with enough settings for me. the only cons is that the wire is a bit short, but it&#x27;s fine if one sits closely enough to the socket.</li>
    <li> This product works plugged in or for an adequate time on its rechargeable battery. the combs of different lengths lets you do your kids hair (or your spouse and relatives) without fear of botching it up. Start with the longer combs if you are concerned, and work down. Also, it gets really close if you want to simply do a military or crew cut. Norelco makes fine products, and this one does the job.</li>
    <li> For more than one reason, I haven&#x27;t seen the insides of a hair-cuttery in more than a decade. Flowbee was my trusted hair-management solution for all these years until I had the opportunity to try Norelco&#x27;s &#x27;Power Hair Clipper&#x27;, model QC5055.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unlikely to ever return to Flowbee now because the QC5055 does the job much faster, it&#x27;s less noisy and delivers a much better quality haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once charged, all you need to do is attach the proper comb (see below), select the desired hair length and proceed with cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair-cutting tends to be a borderline traumatic experience for me - I&#x27;m a long hair type person - but this was a near-painless experience. I am looking forward to more future haircuts. It goes fast, smooth and easy. From time to time, you may have to clean the comb and/or the clipping attachment but that can be done quickly and easily. My wife gave me a near-professional-quality haircut in about 10-15 minutes and finished me with sufficient momentum to place our 12 yr. son under the cutter and &#x27;even him out&#x27; as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The hair clipper body hosting the rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;- The clipping attachment&lt;br /&gt;- Stainless steel, self-sharpening cutting blades&lt;br /&gt;- Large comb&lt;br /&gt;- Small comb&lt;br /&gt;- Stubble comb&lt;br /&gt;- Charger&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;- English/Spanish instructions&lt;br /&gt;- Registration card with $20 coupon offer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some specs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life is rated at about 35 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Charge time is 10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;- Cuts hair from .12 in./3 mm to 1.61 in./41 mm.&lt;br /&gt;- 15 length settings between the 3 combs (seven on each of the large and small combs plus the stubble comb)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returns and warranties:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a 45-day money back guarantee promise if the customer can provide proof of purchase and ships the item, insured, to Norelco at own expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2-year warranty promises to replace defective products for as long as the customer didn&#x27;t do anything &#x27;unreasonable&#x27; and he/she paid for shipping the item to Norelco, preferably insured.

    <li> I wanted to take some bulk off of my sons ever thickening hair, not a shave but a thinning.  Surprisingly with the appropriate attachement I was able to take inches off of length and thickness quite easily.  This really is a multitool for haircutting and offers much more than the old buzz shave.  In about 15 mintues I gave my son a terrific haircut using just these clippers, I even used the lower settings to trim his bangs and they took off just the right amount to get them out of his eyes.  I did notice that I had much more power when the unit was plugged in, even with a full recharge this clipper just offers more power when not run off of the battery which offers 30 mins of cutting for a 10 hour charge.  If you can forgo the wireless aspect these are terrific, but even unplugged they do the job just not as powerfully.</li>
    <li> Its the nicest trimmer I have ever had.the fact that you can wash the whole kit under watet its where is separate it with other brands and models. the trimmer it self  feels solid in the hand for its great price.</li>
    <li> this product is the best. If your looking for a great hair clipper YOU NEED TO GET THIS</li>
    <li> These clippers are very heavy duty and I really enjoy them except for the combs which are rather flimsy. They are the only thing keeping this from a five star review. I would really like to see this model with a sliding adjustable comb as it cuts very well and feels good in hand. Maybe they will get it right in the next model.</li>
    <li> The clippers have plenty of power but the guides are kind of cheap made.  I cut my hair short and it leaves lines in my hair where some areas are shorter than others.  I can not use the clippers because of this.</li>
    <li> There are hair clipper manufacturers out there who think that they can impress potential buyers with the amount of parts in a clipper kit. My question is: Why would you want a hair clipper kit with 15, 20 or a million parts, when all you need is three parts? And another question: Why would you want blades that need oiling, when there are blades that work fine without any oil? A third question: Why would you settle for the option of only buzzing your hair, when there are clipper combs that can style much longer hair?    For years, Philips Norelco has made cutting and styling hair so much easier than most other clipper manufacturers. This is my second Philips cordless hair clipper. I used the first one for over five years, and it was in perfect condition when I handed it over to its new owner. I have been even more pleased and impressed with this new one, the QC5055.    The design of Philips clippers is better than anything else I&#x27;ve used for the task of styling and cutting hair, and I have been using hair clippers for over fifteen years. First of all, the QC5055 is very quiet compared to some of the more \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; clippers that produce much noise. The clipper is light-weight. The rubberized handle affords a good grip. The smart design makes many different cuts and styles possible with just three different clipper combs, as the combs can be adjusted to several different length settings in just a couple of seconds. No more looking for the perfect comb among fifty different options! The self-sharpening blades also do away with the hassle of having to mess around with oil.    A full charge of the battery in a new clipper will provide power for two or even three full haircuts. Time will tell how much the battery will lose its initial capacity. The important thing to note here is that the clipper can be plugged into a wall outlet at any time. So even if the battery should run low, as long as there is an outlet available, the job can be finished. Using the clipper withthe cord plugged in will also provide optimal power for any though cutting conditions.    Cleaning the clipper is easy and handy. The upper half can be detached from the handle and rinsed under running water. The blade itself can also be easily detached for thorough cleaning of the entire machine.    All in all I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more from a clipper. Maybe somewhere down the line newer and even better clipper designs will follow. But for know, as far as I know, there is no better way of cutting and styling short and medium-length hair.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I&#x27;ve used it for four years and it is still working. The only problem is that the lock-ins were awfully weak! Broke too easily!</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying I&#x27;m really starting to love Philips Norelco products. I was always a Braun guy but I&#x27;m starting to convert, based on amazon reviews and my own recent purchases. As an example, I&#x27;m a recent owner and very happy owner of the [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I want to love this product, I really do. It&#x27;s (for the most part) high quality, its rechargeable, you can clean it under tap water (a must for me), its light-weight, it&#x27;s a brand I trust. I love that there are no blades to replace (self sharpening), I love that the clipper attachments are built-in/adjustable (no swapping required for me) and I love that it comes apart easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first haircut - too short!&lt;br /&gt;You could call this my fault, or you could call it bad design. Or both. I&#x27;m a guy that pretty much shaves his whole head; to keep it simple, and to last longer. I do it myself, because I can and because my wife has better things to do. But I don&#x27;t like it too short. Which is why I tried to start long and work my way down until I got a feel for these clippers. I started at level 3, grabbed the clippers in the most comfortable position I could manage, and started my haircut. I noticed immediately you can&#x27;t go too fast with these. They don&#x27;t have the power of my cheap plug-in clippers, but cost almost twice the price. Which means I had to go a lot slower with these. Perhaps that&#x27;s just a drawback of cordless? Anyways, my hair was already short, and I was only taking off a little hair; but these things start jamming and pulling my hair as if I was taking kindergarten scissors to a tree branch. So I backed off and took it a lot slower and didn&#x27;t snag my hair any more.  First strike. And then it happened. I felt my head and realized my hair was a lot shorter then normal. And it was. The clippers somehow slipped from position #3 to #1 while I was cutting. And here&#x27;s why. To adjust the clippers, you push on a small tab on the back and slide the attachment up and down. Its very easy to do. This tab, however, sits exactly where I grip the clippers when I cut my hair.  And that&#x27;s how it happened; I grabbed the clippers, mistakenly pushed the tab, and slid the attachment while cutting my hair. My vote, poor design. The attachments should lock in place and require a twist or something more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second haircut - bald spot down the side of my head!&lt;br /&gt;You could also call this my fault, or you could call it bad design. Or both. So I cut my hair a second time today - this time making sure I took it slow enough as to not bog the clippers and snap my hair. And I was careful not adjust the attachment position mid-haircut. But upon approval of my wife of my second haircut, and her laughter, I realized I screwed up. Yep, looked in the mirror, and I have a huge bald spot in the side of my head. BALD. So what happened this time? When I cleaned the attachments after the first haircut, and put them back on the clippers, one side of the attachment didn&#x27;t fully seat in its guide rail. The attachment was cock-eyed on the clippers, and the flimsiness of the attachments allowed the clipped blades just enough clearance to shave my head clean. Lesson learned - make sure your attachments are seated perfectly on both sides before cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;-Not enough power if you like a fast haircut - a little too weak for my taste, much weaker then my cheap plug-in clippers (take it very slow and it works)&lt;br /&gt;-Flimsy attachments (seriously Philips, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, YOU&#x27;RE BETTER THEN THIS) - but so far they haven&#x27;t broke&lt;br /&gt;-Attachments can mistakenly be seated improperly on clippers (I have a new bald spot to prove it)&lt;br /&gt;-Attachments adjust too easily (which means you&#x27;ll go too short if not careful)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After writing this review, I think I&#x27;ve convinced myself to return these and obtain something better. I hope Amazon will take them back, or I&#x27;m stuck with these poor performers. Philips Norelco IS better then this. I imagine these were on the way to a great design but shoved into production prematurely. They really need to go back to the drawing board and perfect the design - they are SO CLOSE! But not close enough for this Amazon shopper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take my advice on this one, and look past this product. I&#x27;ll definitely try another product on Amazon, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to try another Philips Norelco product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************************&lt;br /&gt; UPDATE: SEPTEMBER 2012&lt;br /&gt;***************************&lt;br /&gt;I wrote my original review on this product in August 2011.

    <li> Cutting the hair cordless is less power. It&#x27;s good to use it cordless when you&#x27;re in the shower or what ever. I gave it a four because the combs are plastic.. very flexible though.. easy to bend. I ended up messing up a bit. 4 stars is good. I am going to try it with cord next time and see how powerful it is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed. I&#x27;ve only used this twice - on my son and my husband and it just binds up really easily. My son cries because it pinches his hair. I have been cutting hair for 10 years and have never had clippers this bad. Save your money!</li>
    <li> I used this hair clipper and gave my close friend a close shave.  The clipper works in that it will cut hair and allows you to maneuver easily because there is no cord.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about working around the cord and was able to shave my friend&#x27;s head very easily.  The real seller is that it is cordless.  You won&#x27;t realize how much of a difference that makes until you use it for the first time.  It&#x27;s easy to use, and easy to clean.  The clipper is not too small and not too big.  I am 5&#x27;6\\&quot; and about 200 pounds and it fits in my hand nicely.  You can use the clippers and it&#x27;s attachments to cut almost any type of hair on almost any part of your body.      If only it were able to handle a more powerful motor/battery for it&#x27;s design I would give it 5 stars.  Thicker hair might need a bit more juice to make a quicker shave.</li>
    <li> Well, Mike wouldn&#x27;t let me shave his head, and I&#x27;m just not brave enough to shave mine. The product description said this worked great on \\&quot;more coarse or more curly hair\\&quot;, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try in an attempt to get ready for bikini season. All I&#x27;m going to say is....Ladies.....this is not a good idea. I&#x27;ll leave it at that.</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric hair clipper before - so don&#x27;t expect any comparitive review here.    For the first time user, the device worked better than expected. I have used it as a cordless clipper. I have charged it for 8 hours, unplugged it, used the components per instructions in the manual.    Positive things I have observed:   - Light weight and cordless   - Easy to maneuver   - Significant savings on time and effort   - Easy to clean    I an happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Works okay without comb attachments!  Problem is that when combs are attached, the teeth of the combs separate and one ends up with uneven/chopped look!    Battery charge doesn&#x27;t last very long either.    I did like the fact that it was easy to clean.    Gave it away.</li>
    <li> I would give this about 4.5 stars if possible.  The clippers cut pretty well.  The only thing about it is the design of the guards could be better.  They are a bit flimsy and can easily slip out of positioning.  Battery life is good and the clippers are light weight and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper is very convenient as you can cut hair without having to deal with the power cord. The only problem is that it seems the power on the hair clipper doesn&#x27;t last that long when charged so I usually have to connect it back to the outlet to cut my hair. Besides that it has a lot of power and the different size clips allow for different hairstyles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for almost a year now.  The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that when I charge them over night they no long show green for full charge.  They do full charge and work great.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I trim my own hair and my three year old son&#x27;s hair. He doesn&#x27;t cry that his hair being pulled, but he cries cause he doesn&#x27;t want a haircut.     I am trimming my own hair for over 10 years, I do not have a salon or shop but I do a decent job that it is not noticeable.     This product is awesome, it does the job prefect and trims evenly.    I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting or gashing my skin. I don&#x27;t have to sharpen the blades and you can hold it anyway you want it won&#x27;t cut you.      I even trimmed the hair on my chest with this machine which was wrong. Well the machine trims very nicely, but boy then for days my chest was itchy, until hair grew long enough.     This product does not shake your hand and the vibration is minimal.  Easy to clean, you do not need many combs, the three trimming combs that come with it are adjustable which I prefer.    Just a note, when you hold this clipper/trimmer in your hand you can feel the fine craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the fact that there isn&#x27;t too many accessories. Love the idea of never having to use oil and can wash them straight under running water. Great clippers!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this clipper is the weight, It is a little heavier then others I&#x27;ve owned. I kinda like that it is heavy as it feels very well made and I seem to be able to control it better when cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper can trim just about any type of hair whether it be on your head or face or other parts. The combs you get (3) one is for beard stubble, hair: small and large. each comb has about 7 settings for length. As a rule, always use the highest setting first to see the length it cuts, as we know once its cut that&#x27;s it! I feel safest using the large comb and then work my way to the small for around the ears and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave 4 stars is because of the plastic combs (3) that you get. I think they are a little on the cheap side as they bend and give/move a bit rather then staying straight. I&#x27;ve owned other clippers and the combs are very solid and don&#x27;t move and separate while trimming. My fear is that a chunk of hair might trim shorter because they move letting more in then supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its east to clean up too, just brush or rinse the blade and combs in water. It says it never needs oil or sharpening so we shall see on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid hair clipper which is compact and very easy to use, its travel friendly too. Lastly, be aware that the battery lasts around 30 min so if your like me and cut your own hair slowly, have the plug handy cause you don&#x27;t want to run out of power before you finish.</li>
    <li> I wanted to see if this was a good product to cut facial hair with and it turns out it&#x27;s pretty good. I know it&#x27;s not marketed toward facial hair, but I figured since it&#x27;s wireless it might be worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Good battery Life - I received the hair clipper with a full charge around 1 month ago. I have never plugged it in and it still doesn&#x27;t need to be charged. (I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times to cut my facial hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Hair length adapters are designed to be for your head and not your face. The adapters are good and they don&#x27;t feel cheap, but they are too long to cut the mustache area. The prongs stop you from getting close to your nose. You can however use no adapter or the smallest adapter perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent hair clipper with no real issues trimming my husband&#x27;s hair during the test.  I really liked the weight of the machine and the option to use it corded or cordless.  I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it for facial hair trimming although it suggests that it can be used for that purpose it is a bit bulky if you have any real details you&#x27;re looking to keep sharp.    I don&#x27;t completely buzz my own head or my husbands, so the rest of my review is really geared towards what I purchased all the other clippers I&#x27;ve owned even though it&#x27;s not advertised for this purpose. I own a few different hair clippers - mostly to clip my dog&#x27;s Cocker Spaniel hair and I&#x27;ve purchased consumer end clippers made for dogs and for humans and have found little difference between the two (huge difference when we&#x27;re talking about pro-clippers though - if you are looking for clippers because you have a dog with a long coat that you&#x27;re looking to keep buzzed in the summer - just invest in the pro corded stuff, it will save you time &amp; money in the end) For the price, it worked OK on my dog and was probably among the better clippers I&#x27;ve used for that purpose - especially since you could unplug and still use it when your stubborn dog refuses to move into the position you need her to.  Also, being able to rinse the blades clean under running water is pretty helpful to keep a long clipping session moving and I don&#x27;t think it seemed as loud as other clippers I&#x27;ve used - which was nice because sometimes my dog freaks out when the loud buzzing gets near her ears.    Overall, I think this is a pretty decent clippers for regular haircuts.  I&#x27;d consider it among the best from other clippers in the same price range - it&#x27;s not a body trimmer and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for facial hair trimming (unless you had a huge beard you wanted to shave off.)</li>
    <li> Very good product. It works as advertised.     One minor drawback is that they recommend completely draining the battery before operating the unit on plug-in power.</li>
    <li> I bought the QC5055 to use on my partner&#x27;s hair, since I was accustomed to going to a salon for my own haircuts. The first few times I used my new clipper, I was moderately happy with its performance. My partner&#x27;s hair is very fine, and his hairline is receding, but what hair he has is densely populated on his scalp. The clipper plowed through thick but fine hair a bit slowly in the thickest areas, requiring multiple passes to lift all the hair, but performed well with multiple passes.     The only trouble I had trimming Paul&#x27;s fine hair was around the curve of his ears. So for that, I grabbed my new Norelco body clipper BG2030, which I had bought for myself at the same time. Using that, with the plastic comb removed, I was able to trim a nice arc around the curve of his ears.     Then I got to thinking, why am I paying $40 to have my own hair buzzed, while I cut Paul&#x27;s hair for free. But I was not about to trust him to cut my hair.     So I took it to my own scalp, and found it to be a very capable performer on my courser, but thinning and receding hair. For myself, I am running it on #1 along the lower edges, #2 a bit further up, and #3 for the top. It blends beautifully. The only frustration for me was dealing with blending along the nape of my neck.     I like the hair to start from nothing at the nape, and gradually get longer as it gets further up my scalp. I don&#x27;t like a crisp line there. So I decided to try my Norelco Beard Trimmer T980 on the nape of my neck, set to #1, and that did the trick, blending that edge from smooth to stubble, quite nicely. I think that I am getting as good as, if not better results, than when I was going to my salon. And since I have decided to keep my hair shorter than I used to, requiring it to be cut every two weeks, I am quite pleased with the money and time I will be saving.     So to do a complete haircut, at least on our heads, I find myself using three different clippers, but I am very happy with the results. If I was justusing the QC5055 on its own, I would be a bit less happy.</li>
    <li> Just tried this clipper for the 1st time yesterday.  Much better than the Wahl professional unit I had.  Cuts smoothly and is very lightweight, plus it is easy to adjust.  Could use a bit more power but I like the fact that it is cordless.  Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.  Amazon shipped it fast, as always.</li>
    <li> I purchased this clipper about three months ago when an old Remington cordless broke.  I liked the look of this and saw the good reviews.  The first few cuts were great.  All I do is my whole head at 1/4\\&quot; once a week.  It doesn&#x27;t need charged often and is easy to clean.    Issues:  - Because the battery twists off the bottom part of the handle the power delivery is uneven with it revving up and down as you use it because the quality of the connection in the handle shifts.  - The comb has started to bend a bit as I saw some other people notice.  - It&#x27;s starting to chew up my hair.  It feels more like tearing than cutting.  It&#x27;s rough after a pass.  Bear in mind this is after 1 week of growth on really short and fine hair.  I&#x27;m buying a new set today and spending more money.    If the initial cut quality lasted and you luck out and got a better one than me, it&#x27;s a good buy.  Bear in mind you might wind up coming out of pocket in a couple of months later if it goes the way mine did.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to recommend this product.  5 stars.    That said, I would like to say something about the 2 most common complaints I have read about this clipper: 1) That it hasn&#x27;t got full power when unplugged; and 2) That the combs bend too easy during cutting.  So here are my comments to these:    1) If the power is less, it&#x27;s probably because you didn&#x27;t allow it to charge long enough the first time you plugged it in after receiving the item from Amazon.  You MUST allow for 8 hours the first time charged, and 10 or 12 hrs is even better.  After the first time, 2 or 3 hours will probably do fine.  But the first time is absolutely critical to get right.  And remember that you will only get 30-40 minutes of cutting time even when you follow charging instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;.    2) The combs are just fine as they are, provided they are used properly.  Which means, to never press down during use.  This is not arm wrestling.  You don&#x27;t score more points the more pressure you apply.  Just lightly comb the hair with the clipper/comb and let the blades do all the work.  It&#x27;s so simple, it&#x27;s hard.    Enjoy.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, and I would recommend it to others.  It replaced a cheap corded clipper that was noisy and vibrated like crazy, and also required oil on the blades.  This alternative is vastly more convenient and \\&quot;modern\\&quot;.  The clipper appears very well made and of high quality.  Possible cons:  the product documentation states battery life is only 30 minutes.  Apparently the batteries are Nicads, as the instructions warn against short-cycling the batteries (recommends letting them become almost exhausted before recharging - that could lead to the unit failing in the middle of your cut).  Lastly, the comb gets easily clogged with the clippings (at least with my very short butch haircut).</li>
    <li> I have used this clipper several times now and find the clippers short of what I expected. They don&#x27;t cut nearly as well as my Wahl and the attachments are so flimsy I think I will probably break one trying to adjust it or putting it on or off the clippers.  Really poor quality here. The battery takes so long to charge you might as well disregard it and figure it is a plug in. Norelco should have provided some kind of case or bag to keep all parts together. Oh, well \\&quot;value engineers\\&quot; decided they could make a buck or two here.  I did not buy another wahl because of the problem I had with the power cord. I decided to try the Norelco because I love the shavers and have used them for many years. I was not going to try and repair my wahl because it doesn&#x27;t look easy. The cord kinked where it enters the shaver and I have to try and repair the short.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASE THAT ITEM &#x60;IT S COOL BUT IF YOU LOST OR BRAKE THE COMB THERE IS NO REPLECMENT YOU NEED TO BUY NEW THIS IT NOT THE WAY SHOULD BE I GUESS.</li>
    <li> Pros:   - Easy to adjust.  - Easy to clean.    Cons:  - Does not work corded. I&#x27;m not sure if mine is defected, but this clipper does not work when plugged. I was in the middle of cutting my son&#x27;s hair, and the clipper started to pull his hair because the battery is dying, so I plugged the cord. But it still didn&#x27;t give any power. So he ended up with bald patches.   - The battery needs to be drained completely before it can be charged, and it takes 10 hours to charge. Not so convenient.  - The attachments are very flimsy. If I am not careful enough and press the clipper a little bit to hard, the guard will bend and the cut will be uneven.    Overall, this is not a good product. I am very disappointed to get this poor quality product from Phillips.</li>
    <li> Money is tight and I&#x27;m trying to save pennies wherever I can. My son and I need haircuts every 3-4 weeks, so the dollars add up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers make a lot of sense (cents? sorry). :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not a ton of difference between me telling the girl at Supercuts to \\&quot;use the #3 clippers on the sides and blend it on top\\&quot; versus doing it at home, except maybe the mess. These clippers surprised me though, because they don&#x27;t throw the hair all over the room the way other clippers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers come with three different attachments: two for different hair lengths and one for a \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; finish. The attachments impressed me, because they were rigid enough to maintain a consistent length. I&#x27;ve had other trimmers where they were flimsy enough that applying pressure to the attachment would force it to cut shorter, which can be disastrous. I was also impressed with how well they clicked from setting to setting; the settings don&#x27;t matter much if you can&#x27;t click back to the one you want next time you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to see that you could clean these clippers under a running faucet. It made it a lot easier to get a good clean result when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I was glad to see that I could use these clippers on my facial hair too. I don&#x27;t like having different gadgets for different things, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to use these clippers on my beard as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________________&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  7/19/2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the trimmer this morning and thought maybe I should post an update on this review.  I still LOVE this trimmer, but the rechargeable battery has pretty much pooped out.  I&#x27;m really glad this trimmer isn&#x27;t like other rechargeable devices where you can&#x27;t use them and charge them at the same time.  So I just plug it in to use it...no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing to mention is that the combs are starting to get a little floppy, so I have to be more careful not to apply much pressure.  I scalped myself a little while trimming my beard today.  No big deal this time, because the beard grows so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...nearly a year later with LOTS of use and I still really like this product.  It won&#x27;t last forever, but it&#x27;s still pretty reliable..  No big deal this time, because the beard grows so quickly.    Bottom line...nearly a year later with LOTS of use and I still really like this product.  It won&#x27;t last forever, but it&#x27;s still pretty reliable.</li>
    <li> My hair grows like crazy, with money tight these days paying 20-25 bucks every 3 weeks (and a few dollars every 10 days or so to get my hair on the back of my neck trimmed) is a bit crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the walh hair cut kit that costs more than this, and lemme tell you, it was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Philips kit works beautifully (not to mention it looks cool, but that&#x27;s besides the point!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quick and easy to clean and (best of all) it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is actually quite easy, I was a bit concerned at first (I did use the walh previously), so what I did was take my shirt off and go outside and I taped a mirror to the wall and cut my hair that way, clippers in 1 hand, mirror in the other, and mirror tapped to the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how clean it cut my hair and the lack of mess, the next time I used it I used it in doors with minimal fuss (I did it in the bath tub (to keep the mess down), and then sweeped up the hair when finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I was telling my barber about it, and brought it in for him to use on my hair and he liked them as well, and couldn&#x27;t believe the price (the ones he uses are around 300 bucks!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, nothing but impressed.  I also like how it looks (I&#x27;m vain) it just looks so cool and powerful (like a power tool) (insert tim allens hr hr hr here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to start cutting my own hair and this product does it well. It provides a smooth, even cut and it is very easy to adjust and change cutting length. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> WORKS PRETTY WELL FOR TRIMMING MUSTACHE , SIDEBURNS AND BEARDS; PLUS USEFUL TO KEEP YOUR HAIR NEATER BETWEEN TRIPS TO THE BARBER.  LIGHT TRAVELS VERY WELL AS IT IS A SLIM COMPACT UNIT. KEEP THIS IN MIND FOR FATHER&#x27;S DAY!</li>
    <li> I bought this product 3 weeks back and it serves the purpose very well. I used it two times once with power and another time on battery. The battery lasted for about 40 mins and is good enough for a normal hair cut. The only complaint i have is that the attachments are on the cheaper side. They are delicate and need proper handling. But over all this is a great clipper.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after I had to return another brand&#x27;s clipper (because its surface got very hot during its use). This one has a plastic plate over that metal part to protect you from heat, it has no useless gadgets to store as the other one did, the three adjustable combs cover every need, it&#x27;s very easy to keep it clean, no extra maintenance, it works perfect as a cordless, and makes accurate cuts fast. Really user friendly! I am just an average mom, not a hairstylist, but I cut three different styles for my hubby, my son, and for MYSELF (all about 1\\&quot; on the scruff but very different everywhere else), and I always get compliments on them!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and was very happy at the job it did, the charge lasted more than enough time to finish. It comes with adapters for many different lengths and it does facial hair just as well.     2 great features are...  you can wash it under the faucet.  if charge goes out you can plug it in and finish with corded function.    not sure how long the battery will last, or how many cuts I&#x27;ll get out of it, but at $35 i can throw it away if it give me any problems. And I will buy another</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased this hair clipper over all the other cheap products out there.    This is well worth the extra few bucks it costs.  Its durable, stylish, and made with quality, and most importantly cuts hair very well.    Now lets just hope the battery lasts more than 6 months lol.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo15Y3HNE96LOU]]This is a fantastic set of clippers.  I highly recommend it!  If I haven&#x27;t covered everything in the video, please let me know!</li>
    <li> This product worked great at the start but had some problems after a couple of uses. this product ONLY WORKS GREAT FOR SHORT HAIR!!! It messed up my hair because it was too long. If you do use it on long hair it takes a LONG time.</li>
    <li> Nice machine for the money - don&#x27;t expect professional quality but for some basic hair cutting is ok</li>
    <li> it lasted over 3 years n only broke cuz I dropped it accidently other then that ilove it n it was totally worth the 35 bucks good job Philips Norelco.  js</li>
    <li> To work greatly well as a hair clipper, but it does work fairly well as a beard clipper. It is very resilient and has given me reliable operation as long as I&#x27;ve owned it. I&#x27;m not in love with the attachments, but the attachment and head breakdown system is pretty sound overall. Should get many years of operation out of this.</li>
    <li> Having owned this for a while, i figured it was time to give it a review. It is still serving its purpose as a groomer. The blades are kind of dull and there isn&#x27;t much of a recharge. Mostly have to use the shaver plugged in all the time. I&#x27;ve probably used it less than 20 times in 3 years. Wish there was something better.</li>
    <li> It lasted me through several haircut but it&#x27;s time to throw in the towel. The attachable clips are very flimsy and eventually broke overtime. The price is great though. I got my money&#x27;s worth easily by the third haircut. The machine still works well to trim beard without attachments, I&#x27;d definitely keep it plugged in though, it runs a lot better and fast. I would definitely look into buying another provided the clips are a little stronger. You do have to travel slowly through thick hair otherwise it will get stuck.</li>
    <li> When it comes to cutting hair, I learned to cut simple men&#x27;s styles with a pair of [[ASIN:B00008BNZ4 Wahls]] by a pro.  On occasion, I will cut someone else&#x27;s hair, but typically I cut my own.  My goatee consists of course hair, while everywhere else tends to be fine and straight.  Even though I have cut the hair on top of my head in the past, I primarily use my clippers to maintain my goatee and for manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco QC5055 Power Hair Clippers are designed to clean easily, requires no maintenance and, as Norelco claims, can cut any hair type into many lengths with a limited number of pieces.  Three combs are included, a stubble comb for a neat unshaven look, a small comb to cut between .12 and .83 inches, and a large comb to cut between .91 and 1.61 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco clippers weigh about 9 ounces and can be used cordless.  Compared to my [[ASIN:B000I1S18Y Wahls]] which weigh about a pound and is corded, the Norelco clippers are lighter and permit cutting away from an outlet.  Both clippers feel good in the hand, even though they have different shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the real test of the clippers is how they cut.  The Norelco clippers had trouble evenly cutting my goatee.  The turbo power really didn&#x27;t do much when it came to my course hair.  I went over the area repeatedly, and while most of the hair was trimmed I had to grab my [[ASIN:B00006IVEN Wahls]] to catch all the clearly visible longer stragglers.  The next day I decided to try some manscaping.  They did much better on my chest hair, however holding the clippers to one&#x27;s own chest means holding them in an awkward manner or in a way which causes the comb length to constantly reset.  The experience was so annoying; I put down the Norelco clippers and finished with my Wahls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Norelco clippers are easy to clean and maintenance free, they failed to work for me.  For about the same price, one can buy a set of Wahls and get much better results.  Sure there may be more combs, but with all the ones I have I typically only use two.  As for maintaining the Wahls, brushing off the hair and occasionally placing a drop of oil on the blades when needed is about all that&#x27;s required.  The convenience of the Norelco clippers really isn&#x27;t that much better, although it makes a nice sales pitch.  It certainly isn&#x27;t enough for me to recommend these clippers.  Instead, buy what the pros use, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Cordless&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Feels good in the hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Guards slip&lt;br /&gt;Uneven cutting of course hairth all the ones I have I typically only use two.

    <li> My wife is a professional hair stylist. She cuts my hair every 2-3 weeks and relies heavily on using electric shears to do so.  This unit works very well. It can work plugged in, or with battery, which should give you about 40 minutes of time per charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shears are sharp and do a great job of cutting through my thick hair. The attachments are also very nice. Unlike other units that have 6 or 7 different guards depending on what you want to do. It has a fixed length one, a short variable one, and a long variable one. For my hair she used the short variable one.  The settings go from 1/16 of a inch up to about 3/4 inch, and the long variable one goes up from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the variable length guards is great as it reduces the number of guards you need and allows you to change lengths on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the shears without the guard is also good for trimming to the skinline, edging and shaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint my wife had is that she wishes it were a little more powerful on battery, but wasn&#x27;t really lacking in power, it is just that she usually uses professional shears. This unit is actually as powerful or more powerful than most shears you buy at walmart or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great shear for home hair cutting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s crewcut season for my active six-year-old son and this cordless hair clipper makes grooming him a snap --- so goodbye to his long tanglely hair caused by jumping in and out of the pool.  I have used the product twice already (once on myself to trim my beard) and can report that the blade does provide even cuts.  I&#x27;m sure the use I will get from it will pay for itself many times over --- and for an extra bonus: no more listening to crying children at Kid Cuts.</li>
    <li> I have used a variety of trimmer and clippers in the past including other Norelco models.  For the most part I view this as a pretty functional but commoditized tool and not much to distinguish between differently types.    What I liked about this one in particular was the build quality.  It just feels solid in your hand and the weight is well distributed.   In addition it is pretty compact and ships with clipper head attachments which are compact as well.   In my first few uses the blades were sharp and efficient, motor noise is minimal and cleanup was easy as there are no real crevices etc. that require too much effort.    I am docking a star not so much for a deficiency on this product but more that there was no real feature to make it stand out and be far superior to others.  I do like it and appreciate the quality of construction and would recommend it if you are in the market for a hair clipper/beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> nice clippers , generally use as a trimmer, quiet, holds charge well. has multiple attatchments</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for over 14 years so I&#x27;ve been through quite a few number of hair clippers.  I bought this one not to replace my old shears, but for convenience with future travels and thought this would make a great portable buzzer.  Let&#x27;s just say the 4 and 5 star reviews here go to the design of the clippers and the attachable clips, not the actual quality of the cut.  I don&#x27;t care much for the clips since I use the combs more for fade cuts, and the blades do not cut that good.  I need to make several passes to make sure the hair is cut.  My old trusty Remington does just that, 1 pass and all the hair is cut.      For this buzzer, 2 stars for the cut, 3 stars for the clip design.</li>
    <li> excellent haircut. You can use it both by the battery and pldged it into power supply. There has little noise when it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in 2010. Didn&#x27;t expect a lot, however it turned out to be a great product. Clipper extensions are really good quality and wont break easy. The clipper itself is sharp and precise. Battery lasts quite a while and its easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair clipper for my fiance. He shaves his head every week. He says it cuts close and in a different angle than his old one, but it works well and he likes it!</li>
    <li> In Europe these hair clippers are super common and they work excellent. Here it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find clippers like these in regular stores. So I rejoiced to find a good deal on Amazon. These are heavy duty clippers that cut flawlessly. I love that I only need one attachment and can cut my entire head by just sliding the attachment up and down!    10 STARS!</li>
    <li> For the price, it paid it self off in four weeks. I have been using this once a week for six months and no problems what so ever, it simply works. Fits well in your hands and not having to worry about putting lubricant on it is great. Being able to rinse it is a big plus.     My one and only gripe about this product is the ability to work while plugged into the wall. It will only work while the battery has been charged, once the battery has been drained it won&#x27;t work if you just plug it directly to the wall. This is not a big issue but it has happened to me once or twice where it died half way through and I have to wait until it has enough juice to finish the job.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT I bought it over 2 years. And the truth is I&#x27;m not happy. BECAUSE ALTHOUGH NOT VERY WELL SHORT Combs and is fairly quiet, the idea of having only 3 combs is a serious error, since each COMB WORKS WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF COURT AND THIS IS THE VERY uncomfortable because QUERAR Level Switch CUTTING COMB moves when you are shaving and this generates to shave more than desired. WANT USE ONLY WHEN SHAVING COMBS completely unused. Using them is a big problem.</li>
    <li> I maintain my hair short due to the fact that I am a cook, so for hygienic reasons and due to the heat of the kitchen it makes sense to keep it short. I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to dig into a bag of 10-20 numbered clips for proper length. This is so efficient and simple to use, totally great. The cleaning is easy and the battery life is good. Just make sure to drain the battery all the way down before fully recharging to get full life and useage. I does a great job as I \\&quot;comb\\&quot; my hair with it daily. Highly recommend for ease of use and maintenance. Awesome product well worth the price and savings from monthly trips to the head chop shop.</li>
    <li> UNIT IS A GREAT CLIPPER, STAYS CHARGED A LONG TIME AND CUTS VERY GOOD. USE IT ABOUT EVERY WEEK TO STAY NEAT</li>
    <li> This hair clipper doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.  After charging we were able to use it once and had to charge again.  After that it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 10 minutes.  We have no choice but to use it plugged in.  The attachments are flimsy.  Poorly made clipper.  Definitely would not purchase again.  Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Very  good clipper , cuts without any problems ,it not matter if the hair are long or short , works on cable or cordless</li>
    <li> so far so good. does the job as is written and have clean cuts....just for the sake of words here!!!</li>
    <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last all that long, but it works great. Occasionally you&#x27;ll get halfway though the job and it will sound like it&#x27;s dying, but works as advertised. The short guard is great for beard trimming, higher guards for clean haircuts.</li>
    <li> works great! water clean it up. I use it to do haircut myself. easy and convenient.</li>
