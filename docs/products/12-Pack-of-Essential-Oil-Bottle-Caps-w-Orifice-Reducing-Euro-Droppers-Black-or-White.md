      <li>Thx - quick shipper - great products.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I will probably end up buying more. :)</li>
      <li>These are just okay.  </li>
      <li>fit my bottles of oils perfectly, now I can drop them in my diffuser instead of pour or have to use an external dropper</li>
      <li>The dropper part is easy to push into the bottle and works well.</li>
      <li>I have not at this time used them, but they look like they will be fine.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s fine, so I&#x27;ll keep them to have an extra &amp;#34;plug&amp;#34; on the large bottles that otherwise, I&#x27;d have to pour the perfume into the palm of my hand lol!</li>
      <li>They fit my bottles, from 10 ml</li>
      <li>fit the bottles well until I tried to use them.</li>
      <li>I was apprehensive about getting these since I read some reviews that said they either didn&#x27;t fit the bottles or they couldn&#x27;t control the flow.  </li>
      <li>good for not having an open bottle but not helpful for dosing out the oils.</li>
      <li>Other than that all good.</li>
      <li>just right</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and packaging was adequate.</li>
      <li>and when it does start, it drops very fast.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, the flow part is a little tricky; you have to get the angle</li>
      <li>These caps didn&#x27;t fit ANY of my essential oil bottles.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit the 4oz essential oil bottles that I needed them for</li>
      <li>The caps are well made and work with Young Living bottles.  </li>
      <li>you either get nothing or a straight stream of fluid.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Some of the droppers have a different flow rate. Other than that all good.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read the reviews on these before purchasing, lesson learned. They are not well suited for EO&#x27;s. They do not drop they pour and since everything u do with EO is measured by drops these do not work. Sucks because I bought 5 dozen. Ug!</li>
    <li> Did not fit in my essential oil bottles of the same size the description says they work for.  Shipping was fast and packaging was adequate.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive about getting these since I read some reviews that said they either didn&#x27;t fit the bottles or they couldn&#x27;t control the flow.  I am happy to report that none of those things happened in my case.  They fit my bottles, from 10 ml up to 1 oz sizes.  To be honest, the flow part is a little tricky; you have to get the angle just right or it won&#x27;t start flowing and when it does start, it drops very fast.  You just have to count double time and once you get used to it, it&#x27;s a piece of cake.  I am very happy I decided to give them a try - and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I received the item a few days off. The item is what I expect it to be.</li>
    <li> The caps are well made and work with Young Living bottles.  I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> These caps didn&#x27;t fit ANY of my essential oil bottles.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit the 4oz essential oil bottles that I needed them for</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in these.  When you try to pour out a drop you either get nothing or a straight stream of fluid.  You are not able to control how much fluid is coming out.  This makes these pretty much useless as I don&#x27;t want to waste my oils.</li>
    <li> Great droppers when they fit. I had two that simply wouldn&#x27;t stay in the bottle but all the rest worked like a dream. I will probably end up buying more. :)</li>
    <li> fit my bottles of oils perfectly, now I can drop them in my diffuser instead of pour or have to use an external dropper</li>
    <li> Found them to be excellent</li>
    <li> I love these! Great quality! The dropper part is easy to push into the bottle and works well.</li>
    <li> Thx - quick shipper - great products.</li>
    <li> The oils will not drip from the orifice.</li>
    <li> product arrived timely and intact</li>
    <li> These worked perfectly, were shipped promptly, and were packaged beautifully. I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
    <li> Just got these today and they arrived well packaged. For the price, you get a generous dozen including the caps. I wanted to use the orifice reducers with larger bottles with the same neck opening  (100 ml or 3.4 oz bottles). They fit perfectly with the .33 oz roll on perfume bottles, but I noticed that more oil perfume came out than I wanted. I still rate these a 5, since the price was awesome, and the shipping was quick, let alone FREE! I was hoping they would dispense the perfume drop by drop so I can carry the small bottle in my purse. The roll on caps tend to leak, but so do these. That&#x27;s fine, so I&#x27;ll keep them to have an extra &amp;#34;plug&amp;#34; on the large bottles that otherwise, I&#x27;d have to pour the perfume into the palm of my hand lol!</li>
    <li> I have to return both packages of  bottle caps.  Although it was noted in the product description that it fits the various ml bottles, it doesn&#x27;t fit and therefore I am unable to use!</li>
    <li> These are just okay.  They do not really fit the majority of the essential oil bottles that have.</li>
    <li> fit the bottles well until I tried to use them. The oil does not drip out it runs out. good for not having an open bottle but not helpful for dosing out the oils.</li>
    <li> these work perfect, very satisfied with the quality</li>
    <li> I have not at this time used them, but they look like they will be fine.</li>
    <li> These worked perfectly.</li>
