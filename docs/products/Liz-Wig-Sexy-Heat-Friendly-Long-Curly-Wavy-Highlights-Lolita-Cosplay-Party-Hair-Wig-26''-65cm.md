      <li>Shipping was quick though!</li>
      <li>This wig is super pretty and the colors are gorgeous but the bangs are a lot longer than the picture shown and the cap slides off super easy</li>
      <li>It tolerated low heat styling, hair spray, brushing and torrential rain and still looks great.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a nice wig, but I&#x27;ve bought better ones at a cheaper price point.</li>
      <li>Fun easy to wear</li>
      <li>I was originally looking on sites like Etsy but was hesitant of spending almost $60-$100 on a wig that would probably only be good for one cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was so excited I had opened it right away..</li>
      <li>So pretty!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so certain that I would recommend the heat friendly label...haven&#x27;t tested myself...</li>
      <li>since it&#x27;s so soft and easily styled.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s got really pretty colors.</li>
      <li>Pretty wig.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and the staff even helped out with finding/ redelivery of it.</li>
      <li>The colors are more vibrant and the wig overall is shinier than it looks in the picture.</li>
      <li>but I found the exact same wig I saw on etsy that was running for about $70 on here for $30 and with free shipping.</li>
      <li>for the price tho, really.</li>
      <li>Not like I will get much use out of it except for</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>well very soft and pretty like everyone reviewed.</li>
      <li>but its not really heat friendly, i straighned it and now it doesn&#x27;t feel right</li>
      <li>otherwise it might have been suitable for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>when I got out which is not often, I mainly purchased it for I can not have dye hair at work.</li>
      <li>I was a little worried about the quality due to the great price, however upon arrival...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a pretty wig</li>
      <li>However not even trying it on for five mins when I had removed it and place it nicely back in the bag, I felt hairs all on me and notice first day it was already falling apart.</li>
      <li>That being said they processed and refunded the extra wig FAST!</li>
      <li>Everyone thought that I had dyed my hair and kept asking me how long it took ;D</li>
      <li>i was surprised.</li>
      <li>The bangs are pretty long and sideswept, so it takes a little finagling to look right.</li>
      <li>Maybe I just recive the bad pick of the wigs from the bunch lol.</li>
      <li>I felt like the fit is really awkward because the bangs are straight down and incredibly long, to where having a large forehead would be beneficial, but since the sizing is so tiny, it&#x27;s hard to imagine whose head this could fit properly.</li>

    <li> this wig makes me feel magical! and that&#x27;s perfect because i wanted to wear it for a unicorn costume. i think I&#x27;ll wear it other times as well though! since it&#x27;s so soft and easily styled. i straightened it with a flat iron with no problems. brushes easily too! i was surprised. thank you. will order again.</li>
    <li> Really cute wig.  The bangs are pretty long and sideswept, so it takes a little finagling to look right. The colors are more vibrant and the wig overall is shinier than it looks in the picture.</li>
    <li> Love the wig... the length is good, and the softness if great.</li>
    <li> I got this wig for a Paige the Notepad cosplay awhile back and I recently brought it back out and it&#x27;s still in lovely condition! It&#x27;s such a pretty wig and it&#x27;s easy to style and to keep looking nice.</li>
    <li> Colors do not match pictures or other buyers descriptions, it is not pastel at all not the purple colors. Does have the curls and length and the quality of the wig was as I expected.</li>
    <li> So adorable my daughter for this and she needed one two months ago that never came. We ordered this one and I&#x27;m there days or arrived. Fun easy to wear</li>
    <li> Pretty wig. I like it.</li>
    <li> Amazing wig bought this for cosplay and it is perfect for what I need super soft and great quality. Love it</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about the quality due to the great price, however upon arrival... it&#x27;s much better then I had hoped! The colors are bright while still being pastel rainbow and the curls are fantastic! It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and the staff even helped out with finding/ redelivery of it. &#x3D;3</li>
    <li> I bought this for a cosplay I&#x27;m doing. I was originally looking on sites like Etsy but was hesitant of spending almost $60-$100 on a wig that would probably only be good for one cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think to look on amazon but I found the exact same wig I saw on etsy that was running for about $70 on here for $30 and with free shipping. It arrived, carefully packaged and I was so ecstatic to actually see it in person.</li>
    <li> I have curled, styled and loved this wig to death!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome purchase!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very durable</li>
    <li> Super cute, accurate, and good quality wig!</li>
    <li> This wig is super pretty and the colors are gorgeous but the bangs are a lot longer than the picture shown and the cap slides off super easy so you will have to find a way to pin it to your head. Everyone thought that I had dyed my hair and kept asking me how long it took ;D</li>
    <li> The wig looks like the picture- it&#x27;s got really pretty colors. I would warn people that it is really small though. I have a small head and it&#x27;s almost too small on me. I felt like the fit is really awkward because the bangs are straight down and incredibly long, to where having a large forehead would be beneficial, but since the sizing is so tiny, it&#x27;s hard to imagine whose head this could fit properly. The bangs were way too long, and too hard to style to the side without looking weird, so I cut them, and they are so plastic-y that they were really hard to cut. It doesn&#x27;t look that nice. I am a hairstylist and used to cutting and styling wigs that I buy, and this one was probably the hardest to get a nice cut on. Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a nice wig, but I&#x27;ve bought better ones at a cheaper price point. Shipping was quick though!</li>
    <li> This wig looks AWFUL on.  If Rainbow Brite and Joe Dirt had a love child, this would be it.  The wig isn&#x27;t very thick, hairwise so it looks like a mullet.  It&#x27;s really long but it&#x27;s long in the back.</li>
    <li> So pretty! *.* excellent price and value for money! I keep managing to double order items on amazon and am not entirely certain if I am handling adult life as well as others. That being said they processed and refunded the extra wig FAST! Thanks y&#x27;all! I&#x27;m not so certain that I would recommend the heat friendly label...haven&#x27;t tested myself...but I&#x27;m not optimistic...for the price tho, really.</li>
    <li> Lovely cosplay wig. We used it for Paige from Don&#x27;t Hug Me I&#x27;m Scared. It&#x27;s good costume quality with an adjustable cap. It tolerated low heat styling, hair spray, brushing and torrential rain and still looks great. My only complaint would be that it was a little sparse in the back otherwise it might have been suitable for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Received my packet today yay :3!! I was so excited I had opened it right away..well very soft and pretty like everyone reviewed. However not even trying it on for five mins when I had removed it and place it nicely back in the bag, I felt hairs all on me and notice first day it was already falling apart. Hope it does not continue this way :(!!  Not like I will get much use out of it except for when I got out which is not often, I mainly purchased it for I can not have dye hair at work. Another weird thing usally when you order something they send a receipt and a Thank you card of some short.. I guess I can always down load it from here. Maybe I just recive the bad pick of the wigs from the bunch lol. If it holds good then I will go from there if not then I will have to invest in money well spend items and go to a shop in person. Good thing is I can still make use with some very cute pictures!!! : )</li>
    <li> I like the colors and the length but its not really heat friendly, i straighned it and now it doesn&#x27;t feel right</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decently nice wig for the price. I feel like it isn&#x27;t as long as it looks in the pictures. The colors are nice and the wig feel pretty nice too. It does come with long side swept bangs but the part just looked fake so I just decided to trim the bangs instead of having it side swept like I wanted. Overall no problems with it I just wish it were a bit long like in the pictures.</li>
    <li> I get many complements on this wig. It is adorable. And I love it Thank you,</li>
