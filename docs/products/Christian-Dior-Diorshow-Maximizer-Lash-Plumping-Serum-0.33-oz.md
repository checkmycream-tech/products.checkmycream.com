<ol>
      <li>I turned to this lash primer when Shiseido discontinued their once wonderful lash primer.</li>
      <li>Awesome!!</li>
      <li>The end result was thicker looking lashes that could have passed for falsies, lol!</li>
      <li>A truly great product.</li>
      <li>Great Great Product.</li>
      <li>The drying factor makes each eye look different--not good.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally right reviews at all, but this stuff is AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love the product but the shipping is so unreasonable!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>and it is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>I have learned through Amazon that Dior has absolutely the best mascara ever.</li>
      <li>Love love it!</li>
      <li>I love love love this product by Dior!</li>
      <li>I have to say that my lashes are in better shape than ever.</li>
      <li>This primer keeps my lashes healthy and it assists with keeping any mascara from getting clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used it close to 4 yrs now and still LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I have so many compliments when I</li>
      <li>love love this primer.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t find them on my pillow in the morn :-)</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, good product.</li>
      <li>I also like the brush, which easily coats every lash.  </li>
      <li>In fact, my lashes look so huge that I do not recommend this product for the office...</li>
      <li>This does a great job of plumping and separating the lashes prior to mascara.</li>
      <li>Although it is a bit pricey its great and actually does what it is made and described to do.</li>
      <li>:P I would recommend this for anyone who has short or stubborn lashes.</li>
      <li>I have been extremely happy with how much length this product offers.</li>
      <li>, if you&#x27;re looking for a primer, this is a good one, but Lancome&#x27;s might even be better due to the difference in the applicator wands.</li>
      <li>This stuff is only fair.  </li>
      <li>I do use it at the office, but I wear full makeup to the office all the time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!  </li>
      <li>I like this very much as it seems to be conditioning my lashes (I no longer lose any) and it doesn&#x27;t interfere in any way with contact wearing.  </li>
      <li>I could buy a cheaper product that does the same work, or even better.</li>
      <li>I first found out about this from a sample in the mall at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>You can actually see it stacking on top of your lashes, making them longer.</li>
      <li>I love the Christian Dior Diorshow Maximizer Lash Plump.....</li>
      <li>It takes a full 3 months to get full results from using this product daily under Dior Mascara.</li>
      <li>For a long time, I thought that any primer (for any product) was just a way for companies to make more money.</li>
      <li>Really thickens and add length to lashes.</li>
      <li>I will never get ready again without it..</li>
      <li>I really like this primer.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make as much of a difference with the Benefit mascara.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re Real</li>
      <li>and i didint really believe it would work</li>
      <li>after applying mascara i felt a real difference .</li>
      <li>Now I know that they&#x27;re really quite useful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this primer.  </li>
      <li>Under mascara, yes, it does make my mascara stay on longer, however it also makes my lashes very crunchy and also sticks them together</li>
      <li>This system works really well for me.  </li>
      <li>My only caution is to be sure and put mascara on directly after applying one or two coats because if it dries it can end up spikey once mascara is applied.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want to wear false eyelashes, do extensions, or pay for Latisse, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>I lke a nice noticeable dark fringe of lashes, and applying this, and letting it dry for a moment, then my mascara (current favorite is Sephora&#x27;s house brand volumizing</li>
      <li>In lieu of that, a little powder on the eye lashes will help too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important thing if you have straight skimpy eyelashes is to start with a good eyelash curler on clean eyelashes, and when you apply the mascara if you use a slow back and forth motion with the wand as you work your way up the eyelash, that really catches every lash.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a decent product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>highly recommend.</li>
      <li>makes ANY mascara flake less, go on easy,  and</li>
      <li>Allergies and dry eyes also compromised my success.  </li>
      <li>above tips are not for a super &#x27;natural&#x27; looking eyelash, but for a more dramatic effect.</li>
      <li>I just make sure every lash is coated and that it&#x27;s dry before applying regular black mascara.  </li>
      <li>Letting the primer dry didn&#x27;t work well with the Dior Blackout (and the primer dries FAST).</li>
      <li>I tried unsuccessfully wearing extensions because I wanted the outside corners filled in and there were few lashes there to begin with.  </li>
      <li>It is well worth the price because a little goes a long way.</li>

<li> last long.  </li>
<li> I curl my lashes and apply the primer, wait for it to dry and then use a regular mascara followed by a coat of waterproof mascara to seal in the curl.  </li>
<li> and i hope it will meet my expectation of a long term result .</li>
<li> It seems to contain tiny fibers that adhere to lashes yet it doesn&#x27;t clump when regular black mascara is applied over it.  </li>
<li> This is another product I can not live without.  </li>
<li> Be careful where you purchase it from.</li>
<li> so I get bigger than usual clumps.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if your lashes actually grow as i&#x27;m not using the product for that reason</li>
<li> Then primer on the other eye, then mascara--instead of putting primer on both eyes and then doing the mascara.</li>
<li> As other reviewers have said, I think the curling effects are over stated.  </li>
<li> Does not plump the lashes like other brands I have tried.  </li>
<li> I love long luscious lashes but shy away from falsies because I hate the whole “bat wing” look.</li>
<li> I CAN NOT live without this!!!</li>
<li> It softens and separates my lashes before I apply mascara; however, it is far too expensive for me to buy regularly.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of product because for years I wore glue on false lashes til my natural ones were GONE  </li>
<li> I may try with the Black out again, but put the mascara on immediately after applying the primer.</li>
<li> use this product with Diorshow&#x27;s Black Out Mascara.</li>
<li> did not work as the previous one i purchased</li>
<li> Although it&#x27;s expensive, it seems to last a very long time</li>
<li> I bought this a few months ago and started wearing it under my Benefit mascara.</li>
<li> and I use it everyday.</li>
<li> It makes my eyelashes long and very thick.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I received a dupe, but the product I received was nothing like the reviews and videos I have seen on it.</li>
<li> I also think the serum goes on too thickly, perhaps because of the style of the wand.</li>
<li> My lashes look so long and thick!!!</li>
<li> Not exactly as good as this one, but serviceable.</li>
<li> A cheaper alternative that isn&#x27;t bad is one of those Maybelline XXL drugstore brands where they have primer on the one end, mascara on the other.</li>
<li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
<li> I was so disappointed.  </li>
<li> Disappointed.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it with Dior Diorshow mascara, and the effect is insane.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love it! It makes my eyelashes long and very thick. Always wear it.</li>
    <li> I CAN NOT live without this!!! i get compliments all the time!! It moisturizes your lashes and you can wear it morning and night.  ALthough I only use it during the day and it has lasted me over 6 months.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My lashes look so long and thick!!! I would suggest getting the Dior Show mascara as well!</li>
    <li> This serum definitely pumps up the volume of my lashes when I wear it under mascara. I&#x27;ve used it with Dior Diorshow mascara, and the effect is insane. In fact, my lashes look so huge that I do not recommend this product for the office...it&#x27;s just too much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did see an obvious volume and lengthening effect, I didn&#x27;t notice any additional curl, which is something the product promises to deliver. I also think the serum goes on too thickly, perhaps because of the style of the wand. That can result in clumps, which will make your mascara look clumpy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this serum as a nighttime conditioner. It definitely made my lashes softer, but I haven&#x27;t noticed my lashes getting any longer because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you&#x27;re looking for a primer, this is a good one, but Lancome&#x27;s might even be better due to the difference in the applicator wands. I recommend using this only for a night on the town, not for a day at the office. Finally, don&#x27;t expect this product to make your lashes grow noticeably longer, because that just isn&#x27;t going to happen.</li>
    <li> I really like this primer. It softens and separates my lashes before I apply mascara; however, it is far too expensive for me to buy regularly. I splurged &amp; got it for myself for my birthday. I do use it at the office, but I wear full makeup to the office all the time. I use it sometimes at night as a conditioner, &amp; it does seem to soften my lashes, but I have not noticed any growth or curl. As other reviewers have said, I think the curling effects are over stated.  I used this with Dior Blackout and it was too clumpy, but I used it with Benefit They&#x27;re Real and it is AMAZING. I may try with the Black out again, but put the mascara on immediately after applying the primer. Letting the primer dry didn&#x27;t work well with the Dior Blackout (and the primer dries FAST). It doesn&#x27;t make as much of a difference with the Benefit mascara. I do recommend doing primer on one eye, then mascara. Then primer on the other eye, then mascara--instead of putting primer on both eyes and then doing the mascara. The drying factor makes each eye look different--not good.  If this was $18-$20, I would consider buying it again when this one runs out, but as it is, who can afford it.  It&#x27;s a \\&quot;wish list\\&quot; item until there&#x27;s a coupon!</li>
    <li> I have learned through Amazon that Dior has absolutely the best mascara ever. I decided to try this product and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. This stuff delivers. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for awhile now and they make such a big difference on my short lashes. You can actually see it stacking on top of your lashes, making them longer. It also helps protect my lashes from getting brittle. I only gave it four stars because of the price is a little high for me. So It means I can&#x27;t buy it often. :P I would recommend this for anyone who has short or stubborn lashes.</li>
    <li> I like this very much as it seems to be conditioning my lashes (I no longer lose any) and it doesn&#x27;t interfere in any way with contact wearing.  My Sephora sales lady also suggested wearing it at night for its conditioning effects.  My only caution is to be sure and put mascara on directly after applying one or two coats because if it dries it can end up spikey once mascara is applied.  Off to buy my second tube!</li>
    <li> I keep an extra in case I misplace one.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of product because for years I wore glue on false lashes til my natural ones were GONE  (beware there). Then LATISSE helped.  Now with the nourishment of this product &amp; I like Chanel mascara, I look like I did with the Falsies...I just don&#x27;t find them on my pillow in the morn :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and started wearing it under my Benefit mascara. In terms of conditioning my lashes/making them grow, this fell very short. No noticeable difference in the length of my lashes. Under mascara, yes, it does make my mascara stay on longer, however it also makes my lashes very crunchy and also sticks them together so I get bigger than usual clumps. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it with a hefty 28$ price tag.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  It takes a full 3 months to get full results from using this product daily under Dior Mascara. A truly great product.</li>
    <li> love love this primer.  makes ANY mascara flake less, go on easy,  and last long.  Lashes look longer and have quit using eyeliner all together - no need!! highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this primer.  It adds volume and heft to my lashes without making them look clumpy.  I curl my lashes and apply the primer, wait for it to dry and then use a regular mascara followed by a coat of waterproof mascara to seal in the curl.  This system works really well for me.  I don&#x27;t think this primer is simply a white mascara.  It seems to contain tiny fibers that adhere to lashes yet it doesn&#x27;t clump when regular black mascara is applied over it.  I just make sure every lash is coated and that it&#x27;s dry before applying regular black mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t make regular mascara flake or rub off at all.  I also like the brush, which easily coats every lash.  All in all, I think this primer is definitely a benefit in my quest for fuller lashes.  The end result was thicker looking lashes that could have passed for falsies, lol!</li>
    <li> This does a great job of plumping and separating the lashes prior to mascara. Have been using this product for years and will continue to</li>
    <li> i bought this and i didint really believe it would work but it does. after applying mascara i felt a real difference . Will continue its use and i hope it will meet my expectation of a long term result .</li>
    <li> This stuff is only fair.  Does not plump the lashes like other brands I have tried.  Disappointed.  Will not buy again or recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the Christian Dior Diorshow Maximizer Lash Plump.....it protects my lashes when using mascara and especially water proof. I would not put on mascara without it!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! I don&#x27;t normally right reviews at all, but this stuff is AMAZING!!! I first found out about this from a sample in the mall at Macy&#x27;s. I will never get ready again without it..</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!  I love this product.</li>
    <li> A must have for mascara users. Really thickens and add length to lashes.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed.  I&#x27;m not sure if I received a dupe, but the product I received was nothing like the reviews and videos I have seen on it. I returned it.  Be careful where you purchase it from.</li>
    <li> I love long luscious lashes but shy away from falsies because I hate the whole “bat wing” look. This primer coupled with the Dior Show Mascara gives me that Kim K effect. It is well worth the price because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I tried unsuccessfully wearing extensions because I wanted the outside corners filled in and there were few lashes there to begin with.  Allergies and dry eyes also compromised my success.  My optometrist started me on lumigan and recommended Christian Dior to fill in until my lashes grew.</li>
    <li> This is my third order of this.  I love the product but the shipping is so unreasonable!</li>
    <li> Love it! My lashes are thinning, this makes them look thicker.</li>
    <li> This is another product I can not live without.  I have so many compliments when I us it.  Great Great Product.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product by Dior! Although it is a bit pricey its great and actually does what it is made and described to do. I&#x27;m not sure if your lashes actually grow as i&#x27;m not using the product for that reason but it does add volume and length! When mine is all gone i will be ordering another one!!</li>
    <li> I turned to this lash primer when Shiseido discontinued their once wonderful lash primer. I lke a nice noticeable dark fringe of lashes, and applying this, and letting it dry for a moment, then my mascara (current favorite is Sephora&#x27;s house brand volumizing mascara).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pricey but it&#x27;s lasted several months. A cheaper alternative that isn&#x27;t bad is one of those Maybelline XXL drugstore brands where they have primer on the one end, mascara on the other. Not exactly as good as this one, but serviceable. In lieu of that, a little powder on the eye lashes will help too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important thing if you have straight skimpy eyelashes is to start with a good eyelash curler on clean eyelashes, and when you apply the mascara if you use a slow back and forth motion with the wand as you work your way up the eyelash, that really catches every lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above tips are not for a super &#x27;natural&#x27; looking eyelash, but for a more dramatic effect.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the recommendation of a Sephora saleswoman and because I was in a mood to splurge on a beauty product. I have been extremely happy with how much length this product offers. If you don&#x27;t want to wear false eyelashes, do extensions, or pay for Latisse, this is a great product. Although it&#x27;s expensive, it seems to last a very long time and I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I will never not wear this under my mascara. I normally HATE primer, but this keeps my eyelashes from clumping, and makes them long and beautiful. I get so many compliments.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product. I use it almost every day but it isn&#x27;t that big a deal. I could buy a cheaper product that does the same work, or even better.</li>
    <li> did not work as the previous one i purchased</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have used it close to 4 yrs now and still LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> For a long time, I thought that any primer (for any product) was just a way for companies to make more money. Now I know that they&#x27;re really quite useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product with Diorshow&#x27;s Black Out Mascara. I have to say that my lashes are in better shape than ever. This primer keeps my lashes healthy and it assists with keeping any mascara from getting clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
