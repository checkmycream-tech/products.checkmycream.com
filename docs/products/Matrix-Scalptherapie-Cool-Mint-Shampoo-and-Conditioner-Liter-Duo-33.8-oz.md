    <li> My husband is very critically with what he uses to wash his hair.  He loves this product!  I like the way it really makes my scalp feel clean.</li>
    <li> What can I say? Awesome product at an awesome price. Just wish they&#x27;d sell the mint Biolage products in the 1 gallon containers! Anyone who hasn&#x27;t used the shampoo before: it smells minty and feels tingly and leaves your hair very soft. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo the mint smell is amazing feels so fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> Biolage is my favorite shampoo to date. I love how fast it arrived as well as excellent packaging. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!! Love how it makes your hair supper soft!!!! You can feel the tingle of clean on your scalp!</li>
    <li> I love the tingly sensation the mint leaves on my scalp. Makes my hair soft and smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> Well, this is the last time I buy bulk shampoo conditioner without knowing the scent. I thought this stuff would be mintier and tinglier, but it&#x27;s more floral than I wanted. Guess I&#x27;m stuck with it for a while. Also, my shampoo bottle was only 3/4 filled.</li>
    <li> I received my ordered items fairly quickly and within the promised time.  The product seems to be the real deal, not a knock off, although the shampoo is not as thick as I remember, all in all I am very happy with my purchase, and the price was right!  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> A good shampoo &amp; conditioner but not cool or minty.</li>
    <li> Used biolage many times before but this shampoo and conditioner left hair very tangled. Other biolage shampoos and conditioners are better. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;It did arrive promply and well packaged though.</li>
    <li> I only used 1/8 of these and I started having a dandruff!!! I hated these!!!</li>
    <li> Lotion in conditioner bottle and body wash/hand soap in the shampoo. don&#x27;t get ripped off. buy your matrix from a salon.</li>
    <li> I tend to have dry flaky scalp but oily hair, tried lots of different shampoos but this one works the best, my hair hardley flakes now</li>
    <li> I just received these today! They were packaged very nice, so no spills and look brand new. They came with the cardboard around them and everything. The company also sent a note thanking me for my purchase and giving me contact info in case I wasn&#x27;t pleased! I was very pleased. I haven&#x27;t got the chance to use the shampoo and conditioner but I love biolage shampoo and conditioner. The reason y I rated these a 4 star is because the shipping was nearly $15!!! Other than that nothing is wrong</li>
    <li> My fave shampoo. :-) Arrived in great time. Priced fair.</li>
    <li> I got the product in a very time matter.  I like the shampoo and conditioner ok, I need to use it more to see if I really like it.</li>
    <li> I have a dry scalp and oily hair. This keeps my scalp from itching and does not make my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner.  I just had making a car payment to get it.  I guess they&#x27;re right.  I&#x27;m cheap.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to say because I am not sure if it is real only because the smell is diluted and off.  So I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  It cleans my hair without leaving a residue.  It smells great and makes my hair shiny.  It even tingles when you use it.  Great stuff. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a descent shampoo but it is obvious that it is a fake to the real Matrix Biolage. the quality is not the same. It does not lather like the real thing, appears to be diluted and perhaps additives put in. Probably will not buy again or recommend to anyone. Want good quality you need to pay the extra money and get your products at the salon.</li>
    <li> Love this product! But it is not as minty as i had hoped it would be! But great shampoo overall.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo. The mint gives my scalp a cooling feel. The condition makes my hair silky. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this set! I love the smell, I love how clean and refreshed my scalp and hair are!</li>
    <li> Over the last couple of years I have been having issues with a horribly dry and occasionally itchy scalp.  Have tried many products including head and shoulders (which did work).  My sister-in-law uses biolage because she gets it discounted through a friend that works for a salon.  I always love how my hair feels after going to get it done but never knew they had a product for scalp help!  Used it almost immediately when I recieved it and im hooked!  Love it, and the smell just wakes you up.  Very refreshing and my hair...and scalp feel amazing!</li>
