    <li> what can i say  i love this and its even better b/c its owls :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s matches my backpack, tote and lunch bag. It&#x27;s cute and holds all my pens. It&#x27;s also good for your sewing kit like your thread and stuff or even your daily meds. It&#x27;s roomy and cute.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the intention to be a makeup bag, but I don&#x27;t tote around my makeup often. I decided the owl pattern was too cute, I use it as a purse! I can fit all my essentials, including my phone and wallet inside. This is such a cute, sturdy bag. I highly recommend for any owl lovers!</li>
    <li> I just had a major surgical procedure and needed to organize my small items since I have  weight restrictions of no more than 10 LBS. I put all my creams, lip gloss, EXPENSIVE essential oils and extra electronics charging cords and adapters in the bag. Now I received this bag on the 8th of March. At one of my dr appts I took it out of my backpack I have been using as a purse. Forgot it in my car that night. GONE SATURDAY March 14th. Nice bag I loved it...I already ordered another one...it should be here tomorrow!!! Jerks!!</li>
    <li> This thing is so amazing, I want to buy one for everyone in the family.  We are all fighting over who gets to use it now!  I bought it because I wanted to make a pattern from it to make a couple of art supply carriers for my girls, but I was extremely surprised by how much space it has inside, and the remarkable design.  The material is surprisingly soft and flexible for feeling a lot like oilcloth.  It doesn&#x27;t have separate layers like oilcloth does, so the outside will not peel and flake.  It is very well-made!  There are many outside pockets for sliding stuff into on both sides, and there are 2 zippered compartments on either side of the middle, where one zipper closes the main central compartment.  It even has 2 small handle sewn into the outside middle edges to carry it with if you so desire.  Did I mention the adorable owl print? Top notch purchase!</li>
    <li> If you like owls, this cosmetic bag is simply &amp;#34;owl&amp;#34;-dorable! I plan to use it as an organizer on my desk. It has several compartments making it multifunctional.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so small</li>
    <li> I really love this little bag. I use it to hold all my little items by my chair, earbuds, iPod,&lt;br /&gt;pens, nail file, etc. the table top is clear. Lots of pockets to hold lots of stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this bag highly and would buy again. It&#x27;s well made.</li>
    <li> Thought it was bigger big love it</li>
    <li> This bag was much bigger than I thought.  It&#x27;s perfect for holding all my art supplies and love the owl design.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is small. I do wish the handles were a little bigger to make it more like a small purse. But when it comes down to to it, it fits everything I need it to.  I can fit my portable speaker, a pack of markers, a pack of pens, my work apron, and my work hat in it and still have room to spare on the outside.  I love it. It&#x27;s one of the best things I&#x27;ve bought in a while because it&#x27;s functional.  Plus, it&#x27;s adorable.</li>
    <li> its really big and  i just love it xx</li>
    <li> This is the best bag! CUTE CHECK... DURABLE CHECK! know one flaw would be that while it&#x27;s big it&#x27;s narrow so if you have bulk to pack I would suggest looking elsewhere, but for a make-up bag or Diaper carrier on the go this is perfect.  and the OWLS oh so OWLY! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> was smaller than i thought but a good bag</li>
    <li> To small wish it was a little bigger</li>
    <li> Great little tote bag, has lots of pockets, very pleased.</li>
    <li> THIS IS SO GREAT BETTER THEN ANY OTHER ONE I&#x27;VE BOUGHT.NO MORE PROBLEMS CHANGING PURSES JUST PULL THIS OUT AND PUT IT INTO ANOTHER PURSE.EVERYTHING FITS YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY ASIDE FROM WHICH THE OWL&#x27;S ARE THE CUTEST</li>
    <li> I love it ❤ It&#x27;s so Cute.. Colorful just what I Expected n Beyond...</li>
    <li> Very cute, I collect owl everything, and this one is super!</li>
    <li> Bought as a mini diaper bag for a family member.  She loves it and it was perfect for short, quick trips to the store.</li>
    <li> This bag is smaller than you might think so don&#x27;t plan to use it for big items. But it is great for all of the small stuff I have to carry around as mom and college student. So many pockets let me arrange everything with easy access. The style itself is adorable. Some owl stuff out there is too cutesy. I love owls and this bag is perfect!</li>
