      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner!  </li>
      <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it.  </li>
      <li>Love being able to order good products online.</li>
      <li>I use it once a week and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>so you can feel better about what&#x27;s going in your hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is ok if plum infusion is your thing, not mine.</li>
      <li>Love the rinse and most of Kevin Murphy&#x27;s products but just as an FYI - this not for a 4 pack -</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it.</li>
      <li>Especially good for us blondes who have to bleach out the grey.</li>
      <li>Smells great and leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous product if you have colored hair or drier hair.</li>
      <li>It nourishes hair and keeps it tangle free.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous product that I have used before.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also paraben and sulfate free</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need but a dimes worth!  </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products!</li>
      <li>This product was recommended to me by a dear friend and she was so right!</li>
      <li>I dont know why someone would pay that much for so little.....must be magic or something.</li>
      <li>Just kept telling me and the other stylist how great</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super concentrated, so it lasts forever.  </li>
      <li>Pricey, I know, but worth it if you have over processed your hair.</li>
      <li>It smells great and makes my hair soft and smooth without weighing it down.  </li>
      <li>(Even with the $20/bottle stuff, my hair felt pretty straw-like, so this is worth every penny.)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It makes my hair soft and manageable with a beautiful shine that I can never get from any other conditioner.</li>
      <li>I keep coming back to it no matter how many conditioners I try.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great day of and definitely helps in this dry desert air I live in.</li>
      <li>Especially when I had extensions, it&#x27;s so gentle and smooth.  </li>
      <li>and I bought the trial sizes to test it out before investing so much into a shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>but my hair has never been so healthy, soft, and shiny in a dry Colorado winter.</li>
      <li>because, first, I was growing it out for my wedding, then I was traveling a lot and didn&#x27;t have time, then I got pregnant and couldn&#x27;t sit comfortably, then had an infant, which makes it hard to get out of the house for something like a hair appointment.</li>
      <li>and there is no indication of a new formula!</li>
      <li>It smells different and is more liquid, less creamy (so more comes out with each squeeze, which is not necessary).</li>
      <li>Highly recommended seller.</li>
      <li>and I ended up having to use at least double the product and wasn&#x27;t able to comb through my hair as easily when I used this product.</li>
      <li>It really controls frizz and split ends but doesn&#x27;t kill natural volume.</li>
      <li>My hair does get very greasy next day though, more so than other products.</li>
      <li>This keeps my hair very soft and silky and moisturized.</li>
      <li>And now, even though I&#x27;m a new mom, and I don&#x27;t get time to wash my hair all that regularly, it&#x27;s still holding up very well</li>
      <li>Used together they repair damaged hair and leave it soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I have naturally frizzy, sometimes-curly hair</li>
      <li>Smelled different than normal, maybe very old</li>
      <li>I got a cut just a few weeks ago (7 months after the previous cut), and the stylist (not my regular stylist) kept going on and on about how healthy and silky and fabulous my hair was (and this is not from the pregnancy hormones, those are long gone).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this along with the shampoo for anyone with dry or damaged hair.</li>
      <li>I am a total shampoo snob, and usually buy Alterna, Paul Mitchell, Back to Basics, Enjoy, Biolage, etc.  </li>
      <li>My hair is completely fried with bleach since I dye my hair pink, and after I use my Hydrate Me shampoo and conditioner and my Young Again serum, you&#x27;d never even know my hair felt literally like straw 6 weeks ago.  </li>
      <li>was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my hair at the very beginning of the shower, then condition, and even though the bottle does not direct you to leave the conditioner in for any period of time, after I put it in, I twist my hair into a bun and leave it while I do the rest of my shower, rinsing my hair just before I&#x27;m ready to get</li>

<li> And when the bottle gets close to empty, you will have to unscrew the cap and stick your finger in to get anything out, unless you want to waste a couple days&#x27; worth of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you have used this conditioner for a few years, you should know that this product has a substantially different set of ingredients that the bottles of the same-named product you&#x27;ve been buying (or at than the ones I&#x27;ve been buying for the last 2 years).</li>
<li> and this is the only product I can use that will allow me to let it air dry and wear it down without doing anything to it.</li>
<li> I keep it on the floor of the shower, with the opening down, and something under the upper part of the bottle, so that the bottle is angled to encourage the conditioner toward the hole.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard plastic, so not easy to squeeze, the conditioner is pretty thick, and the opening is on the side instead of the bottom.</li>
<li> only negative</li>
<li> I only need a dime size of both for my just beyond shoulder-length thick hair.  </li>
<li> I knew very little about this product before buying but thought I&#x27;d take a chance since my hair staples such as Aveda have been failing me lately.  </li>
<li> I purchased it online to save a little money and of course, have it delivered to me.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side but as others have pointed out, you need not use a lot to get the intended effect.  </li>
<li> I find it frustrating when products are dramatically changed yet packaged/named the same way</li>
<li> A little goes along way!</li>
<li> Just use little bit on the tip of your fingers and it will do the trick!</li>
<li> Usually they try to sell you some shampoo while you&#x27;re there</li>
<li> It&#x27;s unbelievable stuff.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a faint plum fragrance which smells divine on my just washed hair.  </li>
<li> : the bottle design is AWFUL.</li>

    <li> One of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve found for colored hair!  Especially when I had extensions, it&#x27;s so gentle and smooth.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend hacked my account and ordered a bunch of girly things. I dont know why someone would pay that much for so little.....must be magic or something.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product that I have used before. Smells great and leaves your hair soft and shiny. I purchased it online to save a little money and of course, have it delivered to me. Highly recommended seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a while now and I can&#x27;t go back to anything else. I have naturally frizzy, sometimes-curly hair and this is the only product I can use that will allow me to let it air dry and wear it down without doing anything to it. It really controls frizz and split ends but doesn&#x27;t kill natural volume.</li>

    <li> I am a total shampoo snob, and usually buy Alterna, Paul Mitchell, Back to Basics, Enjoy, Biolage, etc.  My hair dresser started carrying Kevin Murphy products and I bought the trial sizes to test it out before investing so much into a shampoo and conditioner.  I LOVE this stuff!!!  My hair is completely fried with bleach since I dye my hair pink, and after I use my Hydrate Me shampoo and conditioner and my Young Again serum, you&#x27;d never even know my hair felt literally like straw 6 weeks ago.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it.  It&#x27;s super concentrated, so it lasts forever.  It smells great and makes my hair soft and smooth without weighing it down.  And now I can comb my hair again!  I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products!</li>
    <li> Love the rinse and most of Kevin Murphy&#x27;s products but just as an FYI - this not for a 4 pack - it&#x27;s just 1 bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, my hair is silky and smooth!!!  This is one of the best conditioners and the shampoo is great too!</li>
    <li> I use both the Hydrate Me Wash and Rinse.  It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side but as others have pointed out, you need not use a lot to get the intended effect.  I only need a dime size of both for my just beyond shoulder-length thick hair.  It&#x27;s a faint plum fragrance which smells divine on my just washed hair.  It&#x27;s also paraben and sulfate free so you can feel better about what&#x27;s going in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Burt&#x27;s Bees for a cheaper alternative and I ended up having to use at least double the product and wasn&#x27;t able to comb through my hair as easily when I used this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great day of and definitely helps in this dry desert air I live in. My hair does get very greasy next day though, more so than other products. The smell is ok if plum infusion is your thing, not mine.</li>

    <li> This stuff will hydrate ANY hair!  It&#x27;s unbelievable stuff.  Pricey, I know, but worth it if you have over processed your hair.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!! Wish I would have found it sooner. I love the smell of it. Best stuff on the market.</li>
    <li> I knew very little about this product before buying but thought I&#x27;d take a chance since my hair staples such as Aveda have been failing me lately.  It took a couple of weeks but my hair has never been so healthy, soft, and shiny in a dry Colorado winter.</li>
    <li> Love being able to order good products online. It&#x27;s a fabulous product if you have colored hair or drier hair. My stylist recommended Kevin Murphy and it&#x27;s wonderful! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. A little goes along way!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this along with the shampoo for anyone with dry or damaged hair. Used together they repair damaged hair and leave it soft and silky. Especially good for us blondes who have to bleach out the grey.</li>
    <li> Smelled different than normal, maybe very old</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my hair cut only every 6 to 8 MONTHS (instead of every 6 to 8 weeks) because, first, I was growing it out for my wedding, then I was traveling a lot and didn&#x27;t have time, then I got pregnant and couldn&#x27;t sit comfortably, then had an infant, which makes it hard to get out of the house for something like a hair appointment. This keeps my hair very soft and silky and moisturized. (Even with the $20/bottle stuff, my hair felt pretty straw-like, so this is worth every penny.) And now, even though I&#x27;m a new mom, and I don&#x27;t get time to wash my hair all that regularly, it&#x27;s still holding up very well (the hair, that is). I got a cut just a few weeks ago (7 months after the previous cut), and the stylist (not my regular stylist) kept going on and on about how healthy and silky and fabulous my hair was (and this is not from the pregnancy hormones, those are long gone). Usually they try to sell you some shampoo while you&#x27;re there (this is a fairly high-end salon), but she didn&#x27;t say a word about that. Just kept telling me and the other stylist how great my hair was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my hair at the very beginning of the shower, then condition, and even though the bottle does not direct you to leave the conditioner in for any period of time, after I put it in, I twist my hair into a bun and leave it while I do the rest of my shower, rinsing my hair just before I&#x27;m ready to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative: the bottle design is AWFUL.
