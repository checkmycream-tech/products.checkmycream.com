      <li>Very pleased with the price.</li>
      <li>Love these rollers!  </li>

      <li>Almost as good as the original rollers.</li>
      <li>Love the Pedi.  </li>
      <li>I love my Emjoi foot file.</li>
      <li>I love my Emjoi pedicure, these are the replacement rollers.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t seem to be doing any more than the &amp;#34;course&amp;#34; rolllers did.  </li>
      <li>I love my sander and the rollers..</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the Emjoi Micro-Pedi (corded model, 110-240V) got rid of most of the callous with about a half-hour&#x27;s light work with the roller shipped with the machine.</li>
      <li>it came with work just fine.</li>
      <li>Really extraordinary!</li>
      <li>I cleaned the roller dry with an old toothbrush, much more effective than using the brush that came</li>
      <li>I use the Xtreme coarse option most of the time</li>
      <li>Just wished there was one even more coarse!!</li>
      <li>These worked amazing well on my rough heels!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even opening them, I&#x27;m returning in favor of the real thing</li>
      <li>They work very well.</li>
      <li>I have a whole kit of scrubbers, pumices, graters and razors, all of which were a hell of a lot of work for spare</li>
      <li>Sorry, but these are just not as good as the original roller</li>
      <li>It would appear the original Emjoi bright blue rollers are called &amp;#34;Extra Coarse&amp;#34;, followed by a duller blue roller called &amp;#34;Super Coarse&amp;#34;, then green ones called &amp;#</li>
      <li>but I like to use these to &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; down and for more sensitive areas.</li>
      <li>I was disappointed with the original roller that came with the Micro-Pedi; after ordering and receiving the &amp;#34;super coarse&amp;#34; replacement rollers I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t seem to do as a complete job like the orniginal product does.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m tired of companies being able to get over on consumers by using the word \\&quot;Compatible\\&quot;.</li>

    <li> Love the Pedi.  Everyone should have one!</li>
    <li> These worked amazing well on my rough heels!!!</li>
    <li> Sorry, but these are just not as good as the original roller my unit came with.</li>
    <li> These are not &amp;#34;super coarse&amp;#34;. If you have calluses that are enough of an issue to need the machine - these won&#x27;t do the trick. I got the heavier duty ones and I am happy with those. These seem to be the lowest when it comes to coarseness options. In my opinion, they should be called &amp;#34;buffing&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;super coarse.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the original roller that came with the Micro-Pedi; after ordering and receiving the &amp;#34;super coarse&amp;#34; replacement rollers I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> 👍 I love my sander and the rollers.. Just wished there was one even more coarse!! I have a really bad heel because of nerve damage and it builds up pretty fast. It is definitely better than cutting. 😊  This photo is after using the coarse roller... so you can imagine what it was like before.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as the original rollers. Great price.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY IT.  IT IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.    Used one of the rollers and after 3 minutes where the roller is inserted into the pin to hold it in place got STRIPPED.  I tried another one and same thing happened.  I have the long handle Emjoi and the rollers it came with work just fine.</li>
    <li> I bought these as x-tras. I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> These are not genuine Emjoi replacement rollers. They come in \\&quot;The Pedi-Store\\&quot; packaging and do not have the Emjoi insignia on the roller ends.  I&#x27;m not even opening them, I&#x27;m returning in favor of the real thing and I&#x27;m tired of companies being able to get over on consumers by using the word \\&quot;Compatible\\&quot;. Since I wrote this review, they&#x27;ve added the term \\&quot;generic\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers!  I have a hard time keeping my feet smoothed and free from painful callouses, cracks, splits, etc. since I wear flip flops all the time.  Believe me, I have tried EVERYTHING.  These do the trick! I am thrilled with the results. Would buy this over and over again.</li>
    <li> I love my Emjoi foot file. I tried these because they were less expensive than the name brand. They make a horrible squeaking noise &amp; don&#x27;t file evenly. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Since childhood, I&#x27;ve always worn thongs daily; in adulthood, 12 months a year. (Don&#x27;t get all excited--moderns call these flip-flops!) This has resulted in big, hard, rough callouses on both feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING! I have a whole kit of scrubbers, pumices, graters and razors, all of which were a hell of a lot of work for spare results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Emjoi Micro-Pedi (corded model, 110-240V) got rid of most of the callous with about a half-hour&#x27;s light work with the roller shipped with the machine. (Yes, it does require a bit of cleaning as its sandpaper gets clogged with callous dust. I cleaned the roller dry with an old toothbrush, much more effective than using the brush that came with.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;d like coarser rollers to make lighter work. It would appear the original Emjoi bright blue rollers are called &amp;#34;Extra Coarse&amp;#34;, followed by a duller blue roller called &amp;#34;Super Coarse&amp;#34;, then green ones called &amp;#34;Xtreme Coarse&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will try these in due &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Really extraordinary!</li>
