    <li> Great sealed quality products ALWAYS go with INKS MADE IN USA! I haven&#x27;t put them to use yet as I am waiting for other equipment before proceeding. These inks exp in 2016 so that is gives me enough time to put them to use.</li>
    <li> This is more of a grey rather than being titled jet black..good quality ink but not jet black..it&#x27;s more of a darkish grey</li>
    <li> Starbright inks are the best but the onebi recieved is very watery.  Smaller than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping for more but cant change it now.</li>
    <li> i like starbrite,But my last ink came alittle watery...Still my goto ink tho...</li>
    <li> Horrible......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ink is water down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An was dirty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didnt come on time</li>
    <li> Bold sterile and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I was expecting something very dark and that&#x27;s what it is :) I like all starbrite inks so I gave thos one a try and was not disappointed. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Have tried the jet black, the tribal, and the outliner. None of them are really black. More so grey. They do have great color pigments though.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST tattoo ink ever! When I used this I had no negative reaction to the ink at all. Another brand of, so called, high quality ink gave me a very bad allergic reaction. The color is truly black and this ink is STERILE. I consider that an important feature since it is going into your body. I wouldn&#x27;t want anything but sterile ink, it just makes a lot of sense.</li>
    <li> Not very happy with this product. It is very watery. Needs to be thicker for better tattooing. Not very happy.</li>
    <li> This ink is good, it doesn&#x27;t stay totally black but looks pretty decent. It&#x27;s a good liner to practice with.</li>
