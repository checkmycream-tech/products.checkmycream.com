      <li>My skin feels soft and better looking!</li>
      <li>I have used all of these products before, and though I am too old to say they really make a difference, they make a pleasant addition to my routine</li>
      <li>I really like the fact that this serum gets absorbed quickly &amp; doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily as day goes by.  </li>
      <li>i could say the results of this product are almost the same or better.</li>
      <li>Hopefully she&#x27;ll be able to get similar results.</li>
      <li>Because my skin is oily, I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I put on my face in the morning.  </li>
      <li>It smelled funny as well.  </li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t care for the bottle too much either, will give it a few weeks, I do love most of these products by this company, just not this one so much.</li>
      <li>but it is very drying.</li>
      <li>I have been spending so much money on creams from department store</li>
      <li>The product was like lotion, was very runny.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>One word of advice: use this with other products if, like me, you&#x27;re concerned about photo aging, and be sure to wear lots of sunscreen.</li>
      <li>This product is not as effective at stopping wrinkles, although it can produce the same results in much larger quantities, and is easier on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this serum.</li>
      <li>could live without...  </li>
      <li>I can vouch that the product in a matter of days made my skin very soft.  </li>
      <li>This product works as well as others with similar formulations, and a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m even sensitive to several common preservatives that are in a good deal of products.</li>
      <li>My skin feels tight and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I use this with a Hyaluronic Acid serum (for hydration) under make-up &amp; I feel as if my skin looks much fresher &amp; younger than before.</li>
      <li>Amazon, if your skin is sensitive or you&#x27;re phobic about chemicals.</li>

      <li>but I&#x27;m almost 52 years old</li>
      <li>Sor far I like it</li>
      <li>old.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin - eczema/seborrhea.</li>
      <li>Overall the serum is nothing special, just like any other</li>
      <li>There is NO sting after application (unlike many other retinol products) and the product absorbs into the skin completely in just a few minutes.</li>
      <li>Bonus is there were no other irritants in this product.</li>
      <li>Too bad, the price is great for a retinol product.</li>
      <li>I am an endurance athlete who spent too much time in the sun.</li>
      <li>It has a dropper in it, and a little spreads easily so it will last a long time.  </li>
      <li>I use this in areas where I have deep (and fine) lines, and all over my face when I feel like my skin is looking dull.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really hard to judge these things because you can&#x27;t really see the prevention of wrinkles, really.  </li>
      <li>Smells a little funny, goes on silky</li>

<li> The consistancy was just thick enough.</li>
<li> The product was watered down and does not work.</li>
<li> The packaging is not very easy to use.</li>
<li> I used it everyday, twice a day for 3 months.  </li>
<li> I have been using it for a few months and any improvement helps at my age.</li>
<li> Still determining if product is going to work correctly, it takes a few weeks.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> hello&lt;br /&gt;i used to put on my face the most expensive brands estee lauder, lancome , clarins etc...i could say the results of this product are almost the same or better. for 10.99 the results are excellent!!!!i will buy this again. i really love it:)</li>
    <li> this is my first time using this product it is ok i need moore time to see the diffrents on my face</li>
    <li> The product was watered down and does not work. The product was like lotion, was very runny.  It smelled funny as well.  The little  sample packet that came in the box, was complete different.  I felt my face tighten, it looked better but once that was gone, I saw no change after 3 weeks of using this product.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, reduces wrinkles, and improves skin-my skin looks very healthy. I noticed a difference in a couple of weeks. I put a moisturizer on after I apply this. This is an excellent product for the money. I bought it at a Sally beauty store, I&#x27;m so happy I discovered this!</li>
    <li> This product has 5 parabens!!! 5 of them! Read up on how carcinogenic they are. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product if I want to stay away from chemical laden products. Too bad, the price is great for a retinol product.</li>
    <li> I am an endurance athlete who spent too much time in the sun. I&#x27;m currently working on getting rid of age spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase this at the local Sally Beauty store to skip their shipping costs.  I bought it to replace a more costly preparation that had been sold to me by a cosmeticia (GlyMed retinol cream) and I chose the serum because creams often clog my pores. This product works as well as others with similar formulations, and a very reasonable price. One word of advice: use this with other products if, like me, you&#x27;re concerned about photo aging, and be sure to wear lots of sunscreen. Also, you have to keep using them, or the effects start to reverse. So as you can imagine, I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in evening after using a cleanser,and a preparation with hydroquinone in it. It has a dropper in it, and a little spreads easily so it will last a long time.  So you get a great product, great price, lasts a long time, win-win-win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> It worked ok for a while, and has a good smell. The bottle could have been fuller. The consistancy was just thick enough.</li>
    <li> This is a dermatologist strength product that does a great job at refining fine lines on the face. There is NO sting after application (unlike many other retinol products) and the product absorbs into the skin completely in just a few minutes. I use this in areas where I have deep (and fine) lines, and all over my face when I feel like my skin is looking dull. The ingredients are listed on the page here @ Amazon, if your skin is sensitive or you&#x27;re phobic about chemicals. I feel that it&#x27;s a great product, especially for the price...and will purchase it again. I use this with a Hyaluronic Acid serum (for hydration) under make-up &amp; I feel as if my skin looks much fresher &amp; younger than before.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin - eczema/seborrhea. I&#x27;m even sensitive to several common preservatives that are in a good deal of products. Low dose retinol helps. Bonus is there were no other irritants in this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard to judge these things because you can&#x27;t really see the prevention of wrinkles, really.  I can vouch that the product in a matter of days made my skin very soft.  I seem to look fresher after a couple weeks.  Again, hope it&#x27;s not a placebo effect :)</li>
    <li> I love this brand of products. I am 68 yr. old. I use this on my face then apply the Retinol Vitamin A cream. My face is soft and lines less visable. Great products. The price is so good, I used the Lancôme  products for years and VERY spendy, this product is GREAT.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I began ordering it from Amazon rather than Sally&#x27;s because Sally&#x27;s website is inefficient and their customer service is sadly lacking. Even though Amazon costs about a dollar more than Sally&#x27;s, it is worth it because of Amazon&#x27;s excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good for the skin because it is basically a topical application of Vitamin A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penny</li>
    <li> I am on the fence as I haven&#x27;t been using the product for very long. It has a fresh and pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Great intend on to keep buying it. It works on deep wrinkles around the mouth and the eyes too. Thanks</li>
    <li> Product chosen after long investigation of what works.  Price was excellent and product delivered faster than expected.  Product is working on a 62 year old body - now I have to remember to use it.</li>
    <li> Sor far I like it, I hope it works great, and thaks for send me the rigth one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juana</li>
    <li> great product will buy it again</li>
    <li> Smells a little funny, goes on silky, I don&#x27;t care for the bottle too much either, will give it a few weeks, I do love most of these products by this company, just not this one so much.</li>
    <li> Been using product for 3 weeks. It keeps your skin from drying out but have not seen any change in skin or fine lines.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and I set it aside for months. I just happened to use a bit one morning and was shocked to see how my skin texture improved that day. Pores shrank and the skin looked more dewy, fresh and smooth. I&#x27;ve started using it every night. My colleagues asked what I am doing differently lately that gives my skin such a youthful look. I highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day after shaving and it is amazing how good it makes my face feel.....great product, great price!</li>
    <li> Comprei por indicação de um amigo que usa o produto e espero que cumpra o prometido pelo fabricante do mesmo.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, great price, feels comfortable, non sticky, I wanted to give my feedback after I tried for a while and is great, I haven&#x27;t seen more wrinkles, the existing ones have decrease and look smoother.</li>
    <li> could live without...  didnt see ANY change</li>
    <li> Luv this product and purchase was simple with fast delivery.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Feels good on my skin. I know it is better than most because it is Retinol. I have been using it for a few months and any improvement helps at my age.</li>
    <li> I HATE how it smells. It has a weird Neutrogena glycerin soap bar/plastic/vitamin odor that I can&#x27;t stand. I&#x27;m wondering if I got a weird batch or if it smells funky to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a few years shy of hitting the big 3-0 but after spending my teens sans sunblock, I figure I should spend my twenties keeping my wrinkled future at bay for as long as possible. Since I&#x27;ve already spent ~$17 on it, I&#x27;ve been forcing myself to use it and blending it with my day &amp; night cream to lessen the smell. I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results but I&#x27;m telling myself it couldn&#x27;t hurt..</li>
    <li> The serum is OK. The packaging is not very easy to use. Overall the serum is nothing special, just like any other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now.  I have another retinol cream I use at night, so I only use this serum in the morning.  Because my skin is oily, I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I put on my face in the morning.  I really like the fact that this serum gets absorbed quickly &amp; doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily as day goes by.  My only complain is the packaging.  It comes in a bottle with a squeeze pipette cap, and because the pipette tip doesn&#x27;t reach all the way to the bottom, I always end up wasting about 15% of the serum at the end.</li>
    <li> I had just started developing very fine wrinkles under my eyes.  I tried eye creams and the fine wrinkles were still there.  I started using this retinol serum and I swear my wrinkles are GONE.  GONE!  I&#x27;m sure eventually I&#x27;ll get them permanently but I&#x27;m almost 52 years old and I don&#x27;t have eye wrinkles.  I&#x27;m buying a bottle of this retinol for my twin sister, whose eye wrinkles are really starting to be noticeable.  Hopefully she&#x27;ll be able to get similar results.</li>
    <li> This is amazing for the price!  My skin looks healthy and youthful.  I have been spending so much money on creams from department store and I found something I LOVE on amazon.  Who&#x27;d have thought!</li>
    <li> Make sure you realize that \\&quot;Retinol\\&quot; is the name of the company, not the ingredients which are Retinyl.  This product is not as effective at stopping wrinkles, although it can produce the same results in much larger quantities, and is easier on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Price was great, delivery was fast. Still determining if product is going to work correctly, it takes a few weeks. I&#x27;m sure it will and everything was just wonderful.</li>
    <li> Does not appear to promote acne but I have only used it a week. So far I see no change in wrinkles. With Strivectin which I have used in the past,wrinkles seemed reduced in just a week but it is very drying.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother purchasing this.  I bought two bottles that I have used over the past 3 months.  I am very serious about my facial care in order to prevent present and future wrinkles.  I gave this serum a good chance to work.  I used it everyday, twice a day for 3 months.  I saw no noticeable difference in the presence of my small crows feet or forehead lines.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I have used all of these products before, and though I am too old to say they really make a difference, they make a pleasant addition to my routine</li>
    <li> My skin feels tight and smooth.  Also love the dropper bottle making it easy to dispense. I give it an A.</li>
    <li> I think it is helping my fine wrinkles as claimed. My skin feels soft and better looking! I use it with the day creme under my eyes and on lids where I need it most!</li>
