      <li>Great product.   </li>
      <li>Great idea.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it on more then just my nails!!</li>
      <li>This nail polish is AMAZING!  </li>
      <li>It glows really bright.</li>
      <li>This polish, however, is full-nail bright glow.</li>
      <li>fair price.</li>
      <li>and i love it!</li>
      <li>This nail polish is pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>AMAZING</li>
      <li>it was amazing</li>
      <li>I used the Halloween plate from bundle monster and stamped some Halloween designs on my nails, even after doing that and using SV it glowed, very cool polish!</li>
      <li>The top coat doesn&#x27;t damage it, and it is also an extremely cute color!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very flattering on my very fair skin</li>
      <li>Just hold your hands under a bright light for a minute, and enjoy the lovely glow!</li>
      <li>Goes on very very light</li>
      <li>I was so excited to add Zom-body to Love to my collection!   </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>and I wish she&#x27;d given me just one more coat.</li>
      <li>I was concerned top coat may block glow power.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t get this at a better price.</li>
      <li>glows better in person than in the picture.</li>
      <li>She loved it so much that she ordered more after she ran out his time.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t need much light to charge either.</li>
      <li>great on top of other colors alone</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t self level well, so you&#x27;ll definitely need a good top coat or a very steady hand to make sure its as smooth as can be.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE it and suggest it to anyone who is looking for a high-quality glowing polish that&#x27;s still pretty by daylight.</li>
      <li>It does glow, (though not as much as another brand&#x27;s) and it looks pretty nice.</li>
      <li>She wasn&#x27;t sure that the polish would be very glowy</li>
      <li>The glow is strong and consistent.</li>
      <li>This is a super fun polish to use at Halloween, or year around.</li>
      <li>I love OPI Products anyway, the glow with this is strong, and it is a fairly clear tint, so it can be layered over other products and not effect their color too much; but still giving them a lovely glow.</li>
      <li>but it certainly glows!</li>
      <li>I use Seche vite on my nails as well to make sure they dry quickly and thoroughly.</li>
      <li>exactly what was order.</li>
      <li>Grab it fast because it&#x27;s going-going-gone everywhere!</li>
      <li>First coat looks a bit like</li>
      <li>I love OPI, can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
      <li>A little matte, but with a quick coat of Seche Vite; it was nice and shiny.</li>
      <li>color is gorgeous in the bottle but you won&#x27;t achieve the same hue even with multiple coats.</li>
      <li>Nice glow in the dark.  </li>
      <li>it does look green but works really well with a little light charge your good to go!</li>
      <li>I bought this nail polish for everyday use (not just Halloween) and it is so cute!</li>
      <li>I layered it over some white nail polish and it did just fine.</li>
      <li>Even with four coats, which gives very good coverage, I can still vaguely see my nail line.</li>
      <li>Later that night I turned the light out to go to bed and startled myself when my toes made a nice green streak jumping into bed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It absolutely does not.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Beware though you aren&#x27;t going to get a neon glow unless you use a black light, but  you will be able to definitely see them.</li>
      <li>The product is thin which makes it easy to apply neatly but requires more than one coat.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even find ZOM-BODY TO LOVE locally because the spa I go to didn&#x27;t bother getting enough for customers.</li>
      <li>The more you put on, the darker the green will be, and the brighter it will glow.</li>
      <li>Could be used on top of a green nail polish.</li>
      <li>The good thing is, even though you&#x27;ll need quite a few coats, is that it dries very quickly and dries very hard.</li>
      <li>They had it sitting amidst the other polishes available for mani-pedi clients but didn&#x27;t even have it swatched so</li>
      <li>Going to use it way past Halloween :)</li>
      <li>and the fact that you need 5-6 coats for the fulll on green, makes it super glow-y!</li>
      <li>So, initially, I thought this was going to be a much thicker nail polish.</li>
      <li>The bright green caught my eye and since I loooove green</li>
      <li>I ended up using 4 or so to get the full olive green color that the polish has on the nails.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pale and the green still looks incredibly cute on me!</li>
      <li>It turns out to be a pretty green and its so cool in the dark.</li>
      <li>This is a fun little treat for Halloween.  </li>
      <li>Pretty shade of green, I would call it a medium jade color.</li>
      <li>This one just takes a little shake or roll and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>

<li> This is a thin polish to allow for the glowing effect.</li>

    <li> Not much to say, it&#x27;s quite sheer unless you do a few coats. It does glow, (though not as much as another brand&#x27;s) and it looks pretty nice.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is pretty awesome. It is a very thin polish, and two coats will not be enough. I ended up using 4 or so to get the full olive green color that the polish has on the nails.

Just hold your hands under a bright light for a minute, and enjoy the lovely glow! It doesn&#x27;t need much light to charge either. It managed to charge itself when I was watching TV in bed. It was fainter, but it did still glow! Great for Halloween!</li>
    <li> I love this color. Going to use it way past Halloween :) Its a little green when you paint it on, but it actually works and actually glows! I&#x27;ve used it on more then just my nails!! Great idea.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is AMAZING!  I love OPI, can&#x27;t get enough. I was so excited to add Zom-body to Love to my collection!   AND IT ACTUALLY GLOWS!

    <li> You do have to put a lot of coats on. It turns out to be a pretty green and its so cool in the dark. It glows really bright.</li>
    <li> This is a fun little treat for Halloween.  The product is thin which makes it easy to apply neatly but requires more than one coat.  First coat looks a bit like your nails are sickly and will not provide sufficient glow power.  With 2-3 coats the color and glow intensify.  We used this under black crackle polish by Mia Secret and nails still glowed.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed we ordered it but never showed up we where cheated we  where hoping to have it by the end of the summer but its too late now thanks for the rip off (not)</li>

    <li> I bought this nail polish for everyday use (not just Halloween) and it is so cute! I&#x27;m pale and the green still looks incredibly cute on me! And since it&#x27;s OPI it lasts forever on my nails!</li>
    <li> OPI never disappoints. I use Seche vite on my nails as well to make sure they dry quickly and thoroughly. Even after applying SV on my nails this glowed bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware though you aren&#x27;t going to get a neon glow unless you use a black light, but  you will be able to definitely see them. I used the Halloween plate from bundle monster and stamped some Halloween designs on my nails, even after doing that and using SV it glowed, very cool polish!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even find ZOM-BODY TO LOVE locally because the spa I go to didn&#x27;t bother getting enough for customers. They had it sitting amidst the other polishes available for mani-pedi clients but didn&#x27;t even have it swatched so not even the cosmetologists knew they had it. The bright green caught my eye and since I loooove green I asked what it was and I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is gorgeous in the bottle but you won&#x27;t achieve the same hue even with multiple coats. This is a thin polish to allow for the glowing effect. At three coats I can still see through my polish a little and the color reminds me of surgical scrubs.

    <li> This is a super fun polish to use at Halloween, or year around. It goes on very thin, but dries extremely fast between coats. Virtually no wait time. I used four coats, which sounds like it might puddle at the base or edges of your nails, it does not. Even with four coats, which gives very good coverage, I can still vaguely see my nail line. Pretty shade of green, I would call it a medium jade color. Unlike Ghoulish Glow by China Glaze, this polish does not require 5-10 minutes of blending the \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, which settles at the bottom of their bottle. This one just takes a little shake or roll and you&#x27;re ready to go. A little matte, but with a quick coat of Seche Vite; it was nice and shiny. I was concerned top coat may block glow power. It absolutely does not. Glows like crazy. Love it.</li>
    <li> I wore this nail polish to a 5k Electric Run and my nails really stood out after a few coats!</li>
    <li> exactly what was order. A+ rating.  fair price. can&#x27;t get this at a better price. glows better in person than in the picture.</li>
    <li> I love OPI Products anyway, the glow with this is strong, and it is a fairly clear tint, so it can be layered over other products and not effect their color too much; but still giving them a lovely glow.</li>
    <li> great on top of other colors alone it does look green but works really well with a little light charge your good to go!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my girlfriend. She loved it so much that she ordered more after she ran out his time.</li>
