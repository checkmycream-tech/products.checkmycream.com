<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and works very well.</li>
    <li> Great for my hair, and when I run out of lotion good for the skin.</li>
    <li> I was looking for more natural vit E pure oil and this was a mix of many things...its pure or mostly vit 3</li>
    <li> Great vitam E oil love it!</li>
    <li> Vitamin E is great for the skin, I use it when I make skin care products. I wanted some Vitamin E to make lotions and bath oils. This was a great quality product at a good priced. Much easier than breaking open lots of capsules when I am crafting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life-Winning for CMT</li>
    <li> I always buy this product, its a great price, and good for application after a shower.</li>
    <li> Thank you very good product!</li>
    <li> It is not very clear that this is not 100% vitamin e. There are two carrier oils listed before the vitamin e. If you are looking for 100% vitamin e, you should keep looking.</li>
    <li> The oil is ok - goes on ok - but not that it&#x27;s not really E - it&#x27;s a blend. I think coconut oil does a better job moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Good price for the size(much larger than I thought it would be) Also, the quality is very good as well.</li>
    <li> This is nothing more that a little vitamin E added to soy oil. I thought the oil would be a more luxury high end oil rather than soy oil. Well packaged and shipped in good time.</li>
    <li> Using it on my face with no adverse reactions so far.</li>
    <li> The oil is too thin....</li>
    <li> I bought this to use alongside my Red Foxx Coco Butter. The coco butter is great because it leaves my skin nice and smooth. The Vitamin E Oil is for the shine and to keep my skin nice and smooth. This works wonders on the heels of your feet. Keep socks on when you put the Oil on your feet because it is greasy. I plan on purchasing more so that I don&#x27;t run out. I highly suggest this Vitamin E Oil to anyone looking for an All Natural Moisturizer. This has no color or fragrance and its easy on your pockets.</li>
    <li> The product is everything that I expected and need. This company has great customer service.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Fabulous product! It takes care of dry skin in no time, I&#x27;ve used it on my dogs with excellent results!</li>
    <li> Great for using under you eyes for dark circles.</li>
    <li> Although not pure Vitamin E it still does what I need it to.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell a difference.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It&#x27;s product description matches the product. I love the way it feels on my nails and hair. Definitely would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is awsome got it for making lotions chapsicks and it is perfect. I also put it in my hair an hour befor I shower and it works wonders. Great price too</li>
    <li> Put some cocoa butter on your hand then drops of this  with it, rub it on your hands then smoothly evenly apply it on one body part of a time. It feels good.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Vitamin E</li>
    <li> This is the best oil for dry itchy winter itch. It is better than other products I have used. Strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this in combo with my other oils to make bath salts!</li>
    <li> Great product. Love vitamin E</li>
    <li> This product works great!  Most &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; moisturizers cause my skin to break out within the first day or two of using it, but this has not.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this several times, and love it.</li>
    <li> was looking for a less chemically invasive alternative to lotions and a friend of mine (this person is well into their 50&#x27;s) who&#x27;s skin seems almost vibrant. recommended that i only use vitamin e oil on my skin. so i tried this product and people also began to compliment me on my skin tone and vital appearance as well</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, that&#x27;s for sure.  I never have to worry about being ashy again! LOL  It really moisturizes all day, even after a work out.  Smells OK, I usually spray a body spray anyway.  I will keep this on hand.</li>
    <li> Good product last along time</li>
    <li> used it for my homemade bodywash...works great!</li>
    <li> I am delighted to get a very fine product for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;The oil is exceedingly friendly to the body.</li>
    <li> This has a blend of other ingredients. It nice on the skin. I use it right after the shower while my skin is still damn. Dont need much lotion after.</li>
    <li> Got this product to help heal and soften the skin around a surgical scar. It has done a great job of making my skin soft and evening out my skin tone around the scar. I use this product mainly on my scar, knees, and elbows. It has helped battle my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I use this oil often. I have very sensitive skin, and this oil causes no irritation.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery exactly what I wanted thank you.</li>
    <li> Best  product for your skin.!!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 5 years. Discovered it while I was on vacations since I forgot my suntan lotion. It is the best for a nice smooth tan and for a beautiful skin.  I mix it with my body lotion after I shower and my skin is soft and radiant. Recommend it to anyone!!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read the one star reviews.  The product says it is &amp;#34;ALL NATURAL&amp;#34;.  It is not &amp;#34;PURE&amp;#34; vitamin E.  It is Soybean oil as a carrier oil.  I avoid soy and I am really disappointed!  All natural could mean it is made with anything from marijuana to cow manure.  I will be watching out for that term in the future.  The product name is very misleading. There is no place in the product description that says the true ingredients. They should list the ingredients.  I learned my lesson.  For any one out there with a brain...Watch out for the term &amp;#34;Homeopathic&amp;#34; Go ahead and look up the definition.</li>
    <li> This is so nice to keep your skin soft and your homemade lotions and chapsticks fresh!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin soft and nourished with a nice smell!  I love using this!  Really great product!  I&#x27;ll certainly buy more.</li>
    <li> This is not pure Vitamin E Oil. It is Soybean Oil and Safflower Oil with a little bit of Vitamin E added in. What&#x27;s irritating is that the company is presenting this product like it&#x27;s pure Vitamin E Oil ie. the huge font on their product which proclaims it&#x27;s Vitamin E Oil. Vitamin E is the last ingredient on the ingredient list.</li>
    <li> i love this product!  it helps my skin feel smooth and silky. i havent stopped talking bout it. i have recommended it to everyone i know. i will re-order.</li>
    <li> this was a surprise very large size.  I recently had surgery and I now go to pt  they are impressed with the size and I make sure they use the vit e on my scars . it absorbs and is not greasy wonderful product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on all types of our lip balm. Definitely going to order more. Highly recommended to anyone who wish to try.</li>
    <li> Great for massaging or moisturing the skin.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than any where else. I use it as an all over moisturizer each day. Love it. No fragrance and soaks in fast.</li>
    <li> My wife is really happy, perfect to use on the body.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Very Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Good product, not as thick as other V E oils, when you pour out the oil a lot can come out at once. I wish there was a better packaging. I only use a dot at a time. But over all I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Nice for me. Beware if you are allergic to any of the ingredients, such as soy (topically). Feels good and hydrates. I recommend, will buy again, and hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> love this stuff--love this price!</li>
    <li> Not happy at all.  The bottle says Vit E Oil.  It&#x27;s not.  There is a tiny bit of Vit E Oil in there, but it&#x27;s mostly something else.  But I can&#x27;t know what that is because there is a white sticker slapped on the ingredient list, and in attempting to pull it off, it rips off the ingredient list with it.  So if you are looking at pure Vit E oil, this is not it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I use it as an aftershave.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I certain feel my dry skin improving. I feel my dry cracking skin improving after a week of using this product once a day.</li>
    <li> I just received this oil in the mail but have not yet used it for the purpose I bought it (to make some homemade lotion with essential oils) so unsure how to make an accurate rating.  I did try it on my hands today since I have a few small open cuts, hoping it will help them heal faster.  I do like the feel of it.  The only issue I have is that I wish the hole on the cap was a little smaller because it comes out too fast for me.  Otherwise, love this oil so far.</li>
    <li> I have to say I really love this product.it is a reasonable price it makes my skin look nice. it kinda sits on the skin have to rub it in well.</li>
    <li> The only reason I am not inclined to give it four stars is because I find it takes awhile to absorb in my skin, so I need to wait to dress for about 10 minutes after applying.  Not a horribly long wait, but still, in the middle of winter, with my dry-streched out pregnant skin, I would have thought it would soak up right away.  Your skin definitely feels moisturized after!</li>
    <li> Have been mixing it with some lemon juice to fade strech marks.  Has been working very nice.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Great product. Using in my body scrub recipe quality is great.</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  I had abdominal surgery and it healed and minimized the look of the scar.  It also helped with dry areas of my feet.  Definitely recommmend it.</li>
    <li> As described, thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is all natural and a better deal than some of the similar Vitamin E body oils.</li>
    <li> This product really moisturized my skin. I even use it on my hair an it works magic. It is absolutely everything!</li>
    <li> It works, feels nice and moisturizes your skin, it will make you smell vaguely like a food product...</li>
    <li> Good Stuff, Great Price, I&#x27;ll be buying more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I have exceptionally dry hands, this product is wonderful for controlling the dryness.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I usually take showers at night and I put this on my face/body when I get out/right before bed. It helps take off the leftover make-up. When I wake up in the am my skin looks younger and healthier; it occasionally helps reduce the signs of blemishes.... depends how stressed I am.&lt;br /&gt;My main secrete... alternate between this and coconut oil ;)</li>
    <li> I really like this vitamin e oil! Feels great and soothes skin. Great for use on stretch marks and scars. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> good for after sun bathers. put on your body to prevent peeling and your tan stays. this is what I use it for. but all in all, oil is oil.</li>
    <li> Works great. No problems with it. I like that it has a squeeze top dispenser instead of just an open bottle.</li>
    <li> I used to live in the city and the heat in the buildings coupled with the harsh winters outside left me with such dry skin that no lotion helped on my legs especially. I used this in the shower after I am done before toweling off to dry and I have not had dry skin since. A little bit goes a long way as it glides very well over wet skin.  All natural , non fragrance . Love. It is a staple for me.</li>
    <li> I make up my own body products and was a little skeptical to purchase this Vitamin E given the price, but it wowed me and really worked well as a moisturizer and preserver!</li>
    <li> Takes away the itch from be in the sun.  Greasy but it is an oil.  Works as expected and it is used often.</li>
    <li> This is such a great price for such a low price. I got this oil to use as &amp;#34;nipple butter&amp;#34; for a safe and organic alternative to the artificial stuff available for breastfeeding mommas and it works like magic! Dare I say even better than coconut oil! Just a teeny bit is enough to cover the area and it keeps it soothed for hours--right up until the next feeding time. The only complaint I can make is that I fear it may have leaked a wee bit en route to me since the bottle was a bit slippery when it arrived but if the worst thing I can say is something to be expected then I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty great!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but was disappointed upon finding out it was not pure vitamin e oil. It is mixed with Soybean oil and Safflower oil. Thus it is NATURAL, but if you are looking for PURE vitamin e oil, this is not the product. However, I can say I have seen a difference in the appearance of my skin with the help of this product among others.</li>
    <li> Used in making brown sugar body scrub and it works wonderfully on dry skin. Used in conjunction with other body oils.</li>
    <li> I add this to my hair products.</li>
    <li> Not the most pure stuff on the market(compare to bottles that are 60-80$) but it makes my skin so soft. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Mixed well with my coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read the reviews for this product before buying it. The oil does work and help, but . . . The first problem arose as soon as I opened the bottle.  The combination of the way-too-thin oil, the thin-squeezy bottle, with an opening too large for the watered-down oil, resulted in the oil overflowing and creating a mess. It was somewhat difficult to control the flow until the fluid level was down.&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself works okay, but would probably last longer if it was thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed some reviewers complaining about the ingredients making up the oil. I have no problem with the soybean or saffron oils used (I much prefer them to animal fats or derivatives.)&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product?  I suppose I would caution people to the downsides I discussed above. The price is reasonable, but . . .</li>
    <li> Excellent for very dry skin.  Removes scars.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for us eczema people.</li>
    <li> Good product, but the shipping left something to be desired.  The safety seal broke in transit, and the entire inside of the box was coated with a light film of oil.  Didn&#x27;t leak enough to get through the box though.</li>
    <li> I wish i would of know the main ingredient is soybean oil, this oil is too thin. I don&#x27;t know if I am allergic to this since I have never used soybean oil on my skin but  I break out easily since I have eczema. I haven&#x27;t had any rashes latley but now I have three. I&#x27;ve used pure vitamin e oil before and it is clear and super thick. I like to use vitamin e oil for removing make up, when I tried this my eyes were red and they were burning. I like that this is odorless</li>
    <li> My skin is getting soft and smooth....so pleased</li>
    <li> Going to buy it again!</li>
