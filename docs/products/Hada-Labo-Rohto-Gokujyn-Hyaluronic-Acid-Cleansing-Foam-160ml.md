      <li>Excellent cleanser that doesn&#x27;t strip your skin!</li>
      <li>Thank you r/asianbeauty, this stuff is just so wonderful!</li>
      <li>I love this face wash!!!</li>
      <li>It has been great with my combination skin, it leave my skin just perfect for the rest of my routine.</li>
      <li>Its a great face</li>
      <li>It was great at the beginning then I noticed some dryness.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, does a great job removing foundation, oil, and dirt.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has a softener, but perhaps because it has Hyalauronic acid, it can make skin feel great.</li>
      <li>This product works great.</li>
      <li>it removes my cleansing oil very effectively and it does not feel like it stripped my face</li>
      <li>Good price, great product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really loving this!  </li>
      <li>and chances are if it had a gimmick it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as good for skin, so i shouldn&#x27;t complain, but here i am, complaining.</li>
      <li>My face is in love!</li>
      <li>i love this cleanser!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>so glad to have found it on amazon!</li>
      <li>I love this face wash!</li>
      <li>This face wash is amazing.</li>
      <li>It is gentle for the skin, with perfect pH (5.5) to avoid acne and sensitivity.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if I see a difference in my skin, but it washes off the grime of the day after work well.</li>
      <li>It lifts makeup nicely.</li>
      <li>Rinses off great and leaves you feeling moisturized and squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>It does not have a strong scent which is good.  </li>
      <li>Since switching to Korean/Asian beauty products, my skin has never looked better nor has it ever been more hydrated (and my pocketbook has never been more grateful for quality products at an affordable price)!  </li>
      <li>The foam is very luxurious and even though it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing, it cleans very effectively.</li>
      <li>as many US foam cleansers do.</li>
      <li>I love love love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>This means a higher acidity level is required for a cleaner &amp; toner for the products used afterwards to actually be successful.  </li>
      <li>My skin has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably stick with that as it feels a bit more moisturizing too.</li>
      <li>I have never used a better cleanser.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d probably benefit more from using something else..</li>
      <li>Washes makeup off wonderfully but runs out very quickly, just barely over a month at two pumps a day.</li>
      <li>pleasant, clean-smelling, low pH -- feels like a cloud, and does a good job of removing oil cleanser.</li>
      <li>I have slightly sensitive skin and it works great.</li>
      <li>I use it as the foaming cleanser part of a two stage cleansing (face shop bright light cleansing oil as first step)</li>
      <li>I thought it would strip my face of all the moisture because it is a cleanser after all, but my face felt very moisturized after this, surprisingly.</li>
      <li>This cleanser easily beats ones that are 3-4 times the price.</li>
      <li>Great second step cleanser for after oil cleanser :)</li>
      <li>Very gentle but effective foam cleanser.</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous foaming cleanser--but it is a second-step option for me.  </li>
      <li>I bought this looking for a sulfate free ph balanced foaming cleanser.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This does clean my face, easy to massage  and rinse off as well.  </li>
      <li>I tend to use more than I probably have to because the foam is so fun &amp;#62;_&amp;#62;</li>
      <li>then use this great, great cleanser as the second step, rinsing well and following with AHA/BHA toner and essences, ampoules and occs.  </li>
      <li>It is effective and nice part of an overall skincare regimen.</li>
      <li>This would be a great all-around product for anyone who travels, goes to the gym or just needs a gentle cleanser.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>This is perfect, not too acidic but  still gentle enough to use and clean effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very nice lather, you only need one pump.</li>
      <li>New favorite cleanser. :)</li>
      <li>Comes out in a rich, pH balanced foam (5.5 iirc).</li>
      <li>It leaves my face as clean as the Cerave</li>
      <li>, I thought that&#x27;s what clean was supposed to feel like.</li>
      <li>Just clean.</li>
      <li>So far I love this!</li>
      <li>This cleanser is seriously the best.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is a proper pH for skin (5.5 if I remember correctly) and it always does amazingly at making my skin feel baby butt smooth.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure my pores looked more open, like they were gasping for water).</li>
      <li>its so smooth and gentle on my face.</li>
      <li>Along with the fact there is more product than what it looks like is an advantage as well; it&#x27;s been 7 months, and I&#x27;m almost near the end of the bottle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- does an ok job cleansing, but not a deep clean into your pores</li>
      <li>Very gentle and FOAMY.</li>
      <li>A very gentle foaming cleanser.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and no irritation.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, so I use a cleansing wipe first if I need to remove makeup.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, love the short ingredient list.</li>
      <li>I used it and the first time I got a couple pimples on my cheek.</li>
      <li>It has no fragrance and that is very helpful!</li>
      <li>If you use water proof mascara or liner however I would recommend an eye makeup remover or oil cleaner first.</li>
      <li>and my skin has improved so much!</li>
      <li>Although it is a foam wash, the texture of the foam on your face is heavy (in a good way that lets you know it&#x27;s there) and luscious.</li>
      <li>i use it morning and at night and it leaves my face smooth and not tight.</li>
      <li>I like the foam so much, and this product comes out foamy right from the pump.</li>
      <li>but then again I don&#x27;t really know if it does because after I use it I put on moisturizer right away</li>
      <li>Very gentle but cleanses very well.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that will clean your face without leaving you with that stripped, &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling which is actually bad for your skin, this is the perfect cleanser.</li>
      <li>and it is great at removing residual makeup (and I can confirm that), but this product was just not right for me personally.</li>
      <li>It is also gentle on my skin, doesn&#x27;t leave it squeaky tight clean, but instead leaves my face smooth and fresh.</li>
      <li>The cleanser is fragrance free and mild leaving skin soft and clean but not tight or dry.</li>
      <li>very gentle&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do have to use a make-up remover to remove eye make-up though because it does not take that off very well.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really like the smell of this product.</li>
      <li>did not make me break out in the slightest&lt;br /&gt;- very hydrating and doesn&#x27;t make skin feel</li>
      <li>And it came wrapped very well</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>so I really like it.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t disturb my very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My pores are more clean, my face is softer, and my eczema isnt irritated in the least bit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week and the difference is phenomenal!</li>
      <li>Fairly cheap, and the bottle lasts a long time (I use a half-pump every time and mine has lasted 3 months already).</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t dry skin which is a huge benefit.</li>
      <li>My skin is super soft and not dry after I use this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is hands down the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it as the second step in my double cleanse, and it gets my skin really clean without drying it out or making it feel tight. It&#x27;s also pH balanced (the pH is 5.5) and it lasts ages!</li>
    <li> Skin type: oily, minor acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- very gentle&lt;br /&gt;- did not make me break out in the slightest&lt;br /&gt;- very hydrating and doesn&#x27;t make skin feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- does an ok job cleansing, but not a deep clean into your pores&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t do anything for acne</li>
    <li> pleasant, clean-smelling, low pH -- feels like a cloud, and does a good job of removing oil cleanser. leaves my skin SLIGHTLY dry, which i don&#x27;t like. also... it&#x27;s kind of boring. that&#x27;s hard to explain, but it doesn&#x27;t have a gimmick (no snails or acids or green tea), it doesn&#x27;t smell or look fancy, it just gets the job done. and chances are if it had a gimmick it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as good for skin, so i shouldn&#x27;t complain, but here i am, complaining.</li>
    <li> I love love love this cleanser. It is so soft and velvety and a little bit goes a long way. It is not as stripping as other cleansers and I use it with a konjac sponge and I feel that it gets all my make up off. If you have dry skin like me, I would recommend this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Excellent cleanser that doesn&#x27;t strip your skin! New favorite cleanser. :)</li>
    <li> Needs some instructions!</li>
    <li> Washes makeup off wonderfully but runs out very quickly, just barely over a month at two pumps a day. Maybe this is normal for foam cleanser but I felt like having to buy once a month  is a bit excessive. I am halfway through a bottle of AC Clinic white trouble foaming cleanser and it&#x27;s been a month. I&#x27;ll probably stick with that as it feels a bit more moisturizing too.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this stuff!  It&#x27;s my HG cleanser</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really loving this!  This cleanser is a proper pH for skin (5.5 if I remember correctly) and it always does amazingly at making my skin feel baby butt smooth.  Great second step cleanser for after oil cleanser :)</li>
    <li> It was great at the beginning then I noticed some dryness.  It does not have a strong scent which is good.  I still have some left but I think I will be using the hada labo oil cleanser after this.</li>
    <li> Its a great face wash!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;Good ingredient profile.</li>
    <li> This face wash is amazing. It has been great with my combination skin, it leave my skin just perfect for the rest of my routine.</li>
    <li> I switched from a harsh acne cleanser to this low pH cleaner a few months ago.  My skin has never looked better.  There is something to be said for taking care of your skin and not going to war against it.</li>
    <li> it made me breakout.. i hate it</li>
    <li> Total game changer. Previously I used the cerave hydrating cleanser and I always felt a film after rinsing it off, and still have some acne. I&#x27;ve only been using this now for two weeks and my skin has improved so much! Rinses off great and leaves you feeling moisturized and squeaky clean. I still do follow up with the cerave PM lotion because of the niaminicide.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful foaming cleanser! If you&#x27;re looking for something that will clean your face without leaving you with that stripped, &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling which is actually bad for your skin, this is the perfect cleanser. Half a pump usually works for my whole face, so I see this product lasting me quite a while. Will definitely repurchase when the time comes!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is seriously the best. It was obviously formulated to be the correct pH balance for facial skin. The foam is very luxurious and even though it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing, it cleans very effectively. And when you rinse, you face feels SO GOOD!! This cleanser easily beats ones that are 3-4 times the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for a sulfate free ph balanced foaming cleanser. This is a really no frills no thrills cleaners. There is no scent/fragrance, or coloring. I use about a half to a quarter of a pump to wash my face and it feels like washing my face with a cloud. I put off buying this for so long because I was worried it would clean my pores or remove my oil cleanser as well as my harsh cleanser I&#x27;d been using. Now that I used this for about a month I&#x27;ll never go back. My pores are more clean, my face is softer, and my eczema isnt irritated in the least bit. Overall this is a great basic cleanser that doesnt irritate, is affordable, and will probably last me at least 3 - 4 months with daily use.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash!!! I can&#x27;t believe how thoroughly this cleans, and yet my face doesn&#x27;t feel tight &amp; dry after.  It actually feels soft &amp; plump after washing. (I look forward to washing my face because of this) I don&#x27;t know if it has a softener, but perhaps because it has Hyalauronic acid, it can make skin feel great. With other cleansers, I find that makeup ends up on my cotton pad while toning...meaning my face was still dirty after cleansing. But with this, the cotton pad has no make up residue left. I will repurchase this!</li>
    <li> I decided to get this after I saw that everyone raving about it on the Asian Beauty Subreddit. I was previously using Cerave foaming face wash because I heard it has a ph of 5.5 (i read that anything greater than that is apparently not great for your skin). It was a bit too drying for me--it left my face feeling tight after washing and I&#x27;m pretty sure my pores looked more open, like they were gasping for water). I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week and the difference is phenomenal! It leaves my face as clean as the Cerave but my skin texture looks smoother, my pores look smaller, and I don&#x27;t experience the tight feeling after washing. I&#x27;m so happy with this!</li>
    <li> Thank you r/asianbeauty, this stuff is just so wonderful!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to strip my skin, doesn&#x27;t break me out. I use it after taking my makeup off with oil. A very gentle foaming cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First heard about it after seeing it recommended on /r/AsianBeauty and I definitely recommend it too.</li>
    <li> Very nice lather, you only need one pump. Works well but I don&#x27;t really like the smell of this product.</li>
    <li> No strong scent. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out but then again I don&#x27;t really know if it does because after I use it I put on moisturizer right away (I use the Hadalabo moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets all my DHC oil cleanser off my face so I really like it.</li>
    <li> No problems with the pump or design. Comes out in a rich, pH balanced foam (5.5 iirc). I think it&#x27;s basically unscented. Very gentle, so I use a cleansing wipe first if I need to remove makeup. Fairly cheap, and the bottle lasts a long time (I use a half-pump every time and mine has lasted 3 months already). The CeraVe Foaming works similarly for me and is cheaper per amount, but I prefer this one because it doesn&#x27;t need to be lathered up.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful, but leaves my skin feeling dry :(</li>
    <li> This is a cleanser that hasn&#x27;t created any problems for me, especially for my acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its balanced pH and convenient ability to foam well, I can use this everyday without a worry. Along with the fact there is more product than what it looks like is an advantage as well; it&#x27;s been 7 months, and I&#x27;m almost near the end of the bottle. This is another product I will continue to repurchase!</li>
    <li> This is my go to cleanser from now on. I have never used a better cleanser. It&#x27;s so gentle and effective, but like other reviewers said, if you&#x27;re wearing heavy make up, you should use an oil cleanser first.</li>
    <li> The only cleanser my family is using. It is gentle for the skin, with perfect pH (5.5) to avoid acne and sensitivity. Even my son (10 years old) loves it to wash his face. Leave the skin cleaned but not dry.</li>
    <li> i love this cleanser! its so smooth and gentle on my face. i use it morning and at night and it leaves my face smooth and not tight. I have been searching for this product in japan and it was sold out. so glad to have found it on amazon!</li>
    <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s very gentle and no irritation. It also doesn&#x27;t dry skin which is a huge benefit.</li>
    <li> This product works great. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make it feel as if something is on it. I have slightly sensitive skin and it works great.</li>
    <li> I really like this. Its strong enough to wash off my Bb cream and Japanese moisterizer. It does not dry out your skin or leave a tight feeling. Just clean. However I have very sensitive skin. I used it and the first time I got a couple pimples on my cheek. But that could also be from over moisturizing. I reccomend it! Its a great product!  And it came wrapped very well&lt;br /&gt; Arrived early too</li>
    <li> My face.. It&#x27;s not tight anymore! It&#x27;s not dry, and flakey, and sad!! I can&#x27;t believe a low pH cleanser really mattered that much. I&#x27;ve never had one that didn&#x27;t make my face feel tight after washing it, I thought that&#x27;s what clean was supposed to feel like. 100% purchasing again. This bottle will last me a long time, too, since I only need half a pump to a full pump every night. And the clip it comes with to stop it from being pressed down is pretty neat, too! Good price, great product.</li>
    <li> This would be a great all-around product for anyone who travels, goes to the gym or just needs a gentle cleanser. The packaging is convenient and simple much like the product itself. The cleanser is fragrance free and mild leaving skin soft and clean but not tight or dry. It lifts makeup nicely. If you use water proof mascara or liner however I would recommend an eye makeup remover or oil cleaner first.</li>
    <li> Very gentle but cleanses very well. I like the subtle smell, not overpowering. It is not drying but not greasy either. I do have to use a make-up remover to remove eye make-up though because it does not take that off very well. But, I do use waterproof eye make-up so I was expected this. Otherwise, does a great job removing foundation, oil, and dirt.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and FOAMY. I like the foam so much, and this product comes out foamy right from the pump. It is also gentle on my skin, doesn&#x27;t leave it squeaky tight clean, but instead leaves my face smooth and fresh. It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for me and I have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This face wash feels silky soft on the skin. My face is in love! I was actually a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t be enough to remove my makeup but it does very happy</li>
    <li> Dried out my skin and caused unevenness, flaking, and breakouts of whiteheads. It took one skin cycle (one month) for my skin to get back to normal after I stopped using it, during which the flaking and whiteheads continued. /r/AsianBeauty has never steered me wrong and this is one of their HG products since the pH is on point and it is great at removing residual makeup (and I can confirm that), but this product was just not right for me personally. I&#x27;d also mention that my adverse reaction to this cleanser took about 2 weeks to set in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now. I honestly don&#x27;t know if I see a difference in my skin, but it washes off the grime of the day after work well. My skin is super soft and not dry after I use this. I tend to use more than I probably have to because the foam is so fun &amp;#62;_&amp;#62; A plus is it doesn&#x27;t make my acne any worse! I probably won&#x27;t repurchase though- I&#x27;d probably benefit more from using something else.. But if you need just a basic, non-drying face wash, this works well.</li>
    <li> Love it!  My skin looks younger.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! It has improved my skin texture and does not dry out my skin. Although it is a foam wash, the texture of the foam on your face is heavy (in a good way that lets you know it&#x27;s there) and luscious.</li>
    <li> I needed to find a new cleanser which would be at the correct pH level in order for all my products to actually work and moisturize my face. In order for products to  work, it must pass the moisture barrier in the skin.  This means a higher acidity level is required for a cleaner &amp; toner for the products used afterwards to actually be successful.  Many current products which give that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling after use are actually pH tested as a base and provide very negative consequences for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got out my new pH test strips and the Rohto Hada Labo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser  measure a pH level of 5.5. This is perfect, not too acidic but  still gentle enough to use and clean effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does clean my face, easy to massage  and rinse off as well.  It is effective and nice part of an overall skincare regimen.</li>
    <li> So far I love this! A pump and a half took off my makeup and left my skin feeling really soft. Can&#x27;t wait to see how it performs in the long run.</li>
    <li> I thought it would strip my face of all the moisture because it is a cleanser after all, but my face felt very moisturized after this, surprisingly. I like it (:</li>
    <li> Very gentle, love the short ingredient list. I use it as the foaming cleanser part of a two stage cleansing (face shop bright light cleansing oil as first step)</li>
    <li> Very gentle but effective foam cleanser. I use it to double cleanse my face- it removes my cleansing oil very effectively and it does not feel like it stripped my face as many US foam cleansers do. It is pH balanced so it will not disrupt your skin&#x27;s acid mantel. Half a pump is plenty enough to do the whole face. Will never be without!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous foaming cleanser--but it is a second-step option for me.  I use differing oils to remove makeup (usually The Face Shop Rice Water Cleansing Oil or Skinfood Black Sugar Cleansing Oil) then use this great, great cleanser as the second step, rinsing well and following with AHA/BHA toner and essences, ampoules and occs.  Since switching to Korean/Asian beauty products, my skin has never looked better nor has it ever been more hydrated (and my pocketbook has never been more grateful for quality products at an affordable price)!  Gifting this and a few other Korean/Asian beauty items to friends and family for Christmas.</li>
    <li> It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t disturb my very sensitive skin. It has no fragrance and that is very helpful!</li>
