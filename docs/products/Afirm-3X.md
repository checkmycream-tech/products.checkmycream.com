      <li>I have also discovered an AMAZING, MIRACLE exfoliating cloth that I use at night to clean my face!</li>
      <li>I still apply a very light dab of benzoyl peroxide</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure that it would be, given the price.</li>
      <li>She has used several products and found this one to be one of the best.  </li>
      <li>:)    </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT,</li>
      <li>and my forehead seems so much better already after about a month.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>I liked it because it was the most economical.  </li>
      <li>Ok, this is strong stuff.  </li>
      <li>Besides being great for tone, texture, and lines, it also works on adult acne too!</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic retinol product at a much better price point than the competition.  </li>
      <li>I think the price is great compared to most and does the same job.</li>
      <li>and I still see the wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
      <li>Then when I backed off a little, I now have it working perfectly.</li>
      <li>It will smooth deeper wrinkles to a degree, and will tighten skin.</li>
      <li>I love Affirm 3x it is such a good retinol product.</li>
      <li>my skin was clear and soft and amazing!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s pharmaceutical grade.</li>
      <li>light moisture)along with the Glytone Mild Gel wash (non-drying)and AFIRM 2x (non-irritating to me)at the suggestion of my dermatologist.</li>
      <li>I got it for such a good price at amazon.</li>
      <li>Any prescription vitamin A product would be much safer; there is much work to be done to make this product better!</li>
      <li>This one has a little more dimethicone in it, so it has a little bit more of a creamy/slippery feel to it than Skinceuticals, but it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>It does not have a noticable frangrance and is absorbed quickly and not sticky.</li>
      <li>I am simply a consumer that has had amazing results with this product.</li>
      <li>If I see a huge improvement when all is said and done, I will surely report back!  </li>
      <li>I use Affirm3x every night during the warm weather and alternate with Affirm2x during the winter.</li>
      <li>I am 45 years old and have tried many products and this one does work.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Afirmx1 everynight, (after washing my face with only warm water), for two weeks now</li>
      <li>With the 3X strength I use it about twice weekly right now.</li>
      <li>My skin is too sensitive for retin-a, so I love being able to use a retinol product that does virtually the same thing for my skin.</li>
      <li>It also appears to do a good job with evening out the skin tone and diminishing acne and fades dark marks.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to consider the skin type you have and only \\&quot;baby step\\&quot; into the strength of this product.</li>
      <li>did\\&quot; at first.</li>
      <li>It will burn your skin off, you will peel like a dragon, and there will be way more deep set wrinkles for about a week.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than, but works just as well as the higher priced alternatives.</li>
      <li>Afirm actually causes your skin cells to turn over faster, revealing healthy, new skin.</li>
      <li>I have a very oily T-zone with large pores.</li>
      <li>I must admit, because of the money I have spent and the many products I have tried with no results, I was not expecting miracles from this one, but this one really DOES WORK and it does deliver results.</li>
      <li>Afirm has really smoothed my skin and balanced the color tone very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really helping to fade the acne scars all over my cheeks and chin from scratching.</li>
      <li>The majority of skin care products on the over-the-counter market don&#x27;t really do anything for your skin but moisturize or provide sunscreen protection.</li>
      <li>I have used this a while now very sparingly.  </li>
      <li>First let me say this: If this is your first time using a retinol cream on your skin, start with the affirm 1X or 2X depending on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
      <li>It worked as good if not better than rx .1 Tretinoins!</li>
      <li>While this product does contain vitamins A (retinol), E (tocopherol) , &amp; C (ascorbyl palmitate) in a form that can be used by the skin (many other skin products do not)</li>
      <li>In addition to this it contains trithanolamine a pH balancing ingredient that has been linked to cancer among many other health problems.     </li>
      <li>Otherwise, if your new to this product, do not use it every day!</li>
      <li>so I ended up having to spend more money on extra presents for her to open up on Christmas.    </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it even though people say this is not a acne product, I think they probably did not stick it out through the purging process.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I have naturally oily skin, large pores, hormonal breakouts.</li>
      <li>Btw, my skin was oily and I endured frequent breakouts with large cystic pimples.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great and there is no need to use any other product except a deep moiturizer every once in a while when your skin feels dry.  </li>
      <li>I use it daily and over the last several months have successfully watched several brown spots on my face disappear.</li>
      <li>Right now I am only using Afirm 2x three times a week</li>
      <li>It completely turned the problems I was having with my skin around!</li>
      <li>Maybe better, being that there wasn&#x27;t the usual problem of my skin having to adjust to the harshness of the product.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t dismiss that obviously this product is doing something for all of the positive reviews it has received - but it hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.  </li>
      <li>My skin appears smoother and clear.  </li>
      <li>The combo helps control my VERY oily skin and makes my pores look smaller.     </li>
      <li>For reference, I&#x27;m 29 years old</li>
      <li>(I have some old acne marks that it helps with too) and help maintain healthy/younger looking skin.</li>
      <li>I really cannot say enough about this product</li>
      <li>I only put it on at night...and very sparingly now.</li>
      <li>but I got it under control switching to a gentle face foam cleaner (Olay) with a facial loofah pad instead of my Neutrogena soap bar.</li>
      <li>This product has really helped combat the wrinkles starting a appear on my 30-something face.  </li>
      <li>I will be returning to Olay products and probably get a professional peel.</li>
      <li>Also make sure you use sunscreen on your face because retinol makes your skin very raw because it increases cell turnover.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this, especially if you don&#x27;t want to pay Skinceuticals prices.</li>
      <li>I am 44 and I am constantly being complimented on my skin, people think I am in my early 30&#x27;s !!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really see much of a change except a little dryness around my mouth (I have the 3x).  </li>
      <li>it also contains many hazardous ingredients, especially for acne suffers like fats, fatty acids, cholesterol, wax, and silicone oils; these ingredients will moisturize but also clog pores, make skin shiny, and may give people milia.</li>
      <li>Retinol, a form of vitamin A is less stable, and less potent than prescription</li>
      <li>The barely there wrinkles around my eyes</li>
      <li>It works beautifully and is non irritating if you slowly work up to the 3X from the 2X.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the 3X right off the bat because I have a problem with my (age 55) skin sloughing off dead skin cells.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that I have tough withstandall skin either as I do experience contact dermatitis with several brands that are supposed to be more hypo-allergenic (like Clinique products).  </li>
      <li>I did not use this in combination with any other product in the evening - just on a freshly washed and fully dry face.  </li>
      <li>I can see such a difference in my skin texture, smaller pores, completely cleared any problem areas I was having</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have tried other products, but none compare to Afirm.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Ok, this is strong stuff.  I had no idea. That&#x27;s my bad. It gets a three star rating because I thinks it&#x27;s way to $$$ considering all of the other products out there that do the same thing. Otherwise, if your new to this product, do not use it every day! Good God, you&#x27;ll regret that. It will burn your skin off, you will peel like a dragon, and there will be way more deep set wrinkles for about a week. No kidding. I had to place chamomile and tea tree essential oil along with aloe on my face on night. Ouch.     So, it does take off skin layers. Does it erase wrinkles. Maybe by 20%. But that&#x27;s it, tops. I prefer the glycol acid over this.   Also, it is a heavy cream. I don&#x27;t like the feel of it. Too heavy. I only put it on at night...and very sparingly now. I&#x27;ll stick with it until I run out. If I see a huge improvement when all is said and done, I will surely report back!  :)    Using for approx 3 months.</li>
    <li> I have used this a while now very sparingly.  All it does is tighten the face and peel the skin off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks awful while it peels for days and I still see the wrinkles and fine lines. It does nothing to help you look younger...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry another scam, besides who wants a peeling face for a week or so... thumbs down.</li>
    <li> I expected some drying/peeling to occur based on everyone elses reviews but even with regular application (evening use only for 6+ weeks) I didn&#x27;t really see much of a change except a little dryness around my mouth (I have the 3x).  I did not use this in combination with any other product in the evening - just on a freshly washed and fully dry face.  It&#x27;s not that I have tough withstandall skin either as I do experience contact dermatitis with several brands that are supposed to be more hypo-allergenic (like Clinique products).  I can&#x27;t dismiss that obviously this product is doing something for all of the positive reviews it has received - but it hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.  Although I was hoping to find a cheaper alternative to my rx, I think I will stick with my rx cream for the time being, which does seem to do a great job with my skin.  For reference, I&#x27;m 29 years old and I use my rx to help even my skin tone (I have some old acne marks that it helps with too) and help maintain healthy/younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> Does anyone remember Este Lauder, \\&quot;Diminish\\&quot;? I used that product 10 years ago and loved it. It worked. I was at the age though where I was preventing, not treating... When I saw that they have discontinued this product I went on  the hunt...I have been using Afirmx1 everynight, (after washing my face with only warm water), for two weeks now and I haven&#x27;t missed a night. The barely there wrinkles around my eyes have 80% vanished... I will continue to use x1 at night and a moisturizer with spf in it, during the day- until I need to bump it up to x2 and so on...</li>
    <li> Excellent choice for exfoliating and it also does wonders for firming the skin and reducing wrinkles.  It also appears to do a good job with evening out the skin tone and diminishing acne and fades dark marks.  Make sure to use this product with a really good moisterizer as it tends to force peeling within 48-72 hours after using it.</li>
    <li> I waited three months to give this product a fair shot. My skin did not peel to reveal new skin, my pores did not diminish, in fact it diminished the glow to my skin and dried it in spots. I will be returning to Olay products and probably get a professional peel.</li>
    <li> The majority of skin care products on the over-the-counter market don&#x27;t really do anything for your skin but moisturize or provide sunscreen protection. Afirm actually causes your skin cells to turn over faster, revealing healthy, new skin. My skin is too sensitive for retin-a, so I love being able to use a retinol product that does virtually the same thing for my skin. And best of all, I don&#x27;t need a doctor&#x27;s prescription.</li>
    <li> This product is not for acne! While this product does contain vitamins A (retinol), E (tocopherol) , &amp; C (ascorbyl palmitate) in a form that can be used by the skin (many other skin products do not) it also contains many hazardous ingredients, especially for acne suffers like fats, fatty acids, cholesterol, wax, and silicone oils; these ingredients will moisturize but also clog pores, make skin shiny, and may give people milia. In addition to this it contains trithanolamine a pH balancing ingredient that has been linked to cancer among many other health problems.     Retinol, a form of vitamin A is less stable, and less potent than prescription Vitamin A products, and could be less irritating to some but still has the potential to cause serious skin irritation. However even if Afirm had no Vitamin A, the other ingredients here including the additives that are meant to stabilize the retinol and prevent it from breaking down before it gets on your skin, are enough to cause serious reactions. I am shocked that DermaDoctor both recommends and sells this product without any warning. Any prescription vitamin A product would be much safer; there is much work to be done to make this product better!</li>
    <li> This product has TOTALLY cleared up my skin!!! First let me say this: If this is your first time using a retinol cream on your skin, start with the affirm 1X or 2X depending on how sensitive your skin is. I jumped into the 3x and my skin peeled and burned for weeks because I did not start gradually and used it everyday...don&#x27;t repeat my mistake!! Also make sure you use sunscreen on your face because retinol makes your skin very raw because it increases cell turnover. Second, this product did make my skin \\&quot;purge\\&quot; for a few weeks and I broke out. My sister also used it and she did not have that experience, so everyone&#x27;s skin is different. However, after the purging process was over,(meaning all the dirt was in the process of purging out because of the cell turnover process) my skin was clear and soft and amazing!!! So don&#x27;t start using the product if you have big events weeks away. I highly recommend it even though people say this is not a acne product, I think they probably did not stick it out through the purging process. I did my research and learned that retinol is great for the skin and cleans it out thoroughly. Btw, my skin was oily and I endured frequent breakouts with large cystic pimples. Thank God those days are over!</li>
    <li> I have been using Affirm for about 8yrs. My dermatologist reccomended it for brown spots and wrinkles, I have been a faithful user ever since! I am 44 and I am constantly being complimented on my skin, people think I am in my early 30&#x27;s !! I use Affirm3x every night during the warm weather and alternate with Affirm2x during the winter. If your skin is sensitive start with 2x or use 3x every other day. You will see a difference in the smoothness and clarity in just a day or two. Besides being great for tone, texture, and lines, it also works on adult acne too! I really cannot say enough about this product, it is my #1 must have!</li>
    <li> I have been using Afirm, starting with Afirm 1X and now using Afirm 3X. My skin appears smoother and clear.  I plan to continue using it nightly.</li>
    <li> I just turned 45 and have started to get wrinkles around my eyes and forhead from squinting. Right now I am only using Afirm 2x three times a week and my forehead seems so much better already after about a month. However,I purchased 2X a while back and didn&#x27;t use it faithfully and only started using it a lot about a month ago because of some really bad acne I got from using avon ultimate cream spf 15 or avon alternative cream night. So I stoped using those and currently use Alpha Hydrox 10% and Avon vitamin c serum and a sunscreen lotion day and Afirm 2x and vitamin c at night and I only got 3x because I will be running out of 2x shortly. It&#x27;s really helping to fade the acne scars all over my cheeks and chin from scratching. And this is not causing me to breakout. I don&#x27;t know if I will breakout after I start 3x. I got it for such a good price at amazon. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s pharmaceutical grade. It does not have a noticable frangrance and is absorbed quickly and not sticky. It&#x27;s not a very moisturizing item but I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer after but my skin is not really dry. I like that it comes in a metal tube. The problem with using these type of products is that when you stop using them my skin goes back to where it is supposed to look like as you age.</li>
    <li> My mom has patchy dark dry spots on her skin (she&#x27;s 59) and after 3 application, we can see some difference. The skin seem smoother and patchy spots less dark now.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and there is no need to use any other product except a deep moiturizer every once in a while when your skin feels dry.  Great way to save on all your creams.    Good site to purchase from as well with a speedy delivery and affordable prices.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic retinol product at a much better price point than the competition.  My dermatologist recommended it for that reason.  It works beautifully and is non irritating if you slowly work up to the 3X from the 2X.  Needs a moisturizer over it however because it is not very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.  She has used several products and found this one to be one of the best.  I liked it because it was the most economical.  Only problem is that it was not delivered when it was supposed to be.  I never received any response from the company as to why it took an extra week...so I ended up having to spend more money on extra presents for her to open up on Christmas.    Aside from the delivery issue and no response from the company...my wife likes the product.</li>
    <li> I picked this up after reading the book The Skin Type Solution.  This product has really helped combat the wrinkles starting a appear on my 30-something face.  Follow the directions and start using it slowly.</li>
    <li> I started using the Glytone facial lotion step 1 (light moisture)along with the Glytone Mild Gel wash (non-drying)and AFIRM 2x (non-irritating to me)at the suggestion of my dermatologist. The combo helps control my VERY oily skin and makes my pores look smaller.     When I ordered off Amazon, I stepped things up to Step 2 in the lotion and AFIRM 3x. I will continue to use these products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now. I am very happy with the results. I&#x27;ve had some drying/peeling but I got it under control switching to a gentle face foam cleaner (Olay) with a facial loofah pad instead of my Neutrogena soap bar. I have a very oily T-zone with large pores. I&#x27;m 44 and have hormonal chin breakouts monthly. Afirm has really smoothed my skin and balanced the color tone very well. Also my pore size is smaller (or less noticeable). I still apply a very light dab of benzoyl peroxide my chin nightly for the breakouts after using Afirm. I also like the fact that you can get the grade that you need and go stronger slowly. I think the price is great compared to most and does the same job.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a great product! I wasn&#x27;t so sure that it would be, given the price. It&#x27;s much cheaper than, but works just as well as the higher priced alternatives. Maybe better, being that there wasn&#x27;t the usual problem of my skin having to adjust to the harshness of the product. No irritation or sensitivity. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using 3x for 3-4 months. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my skin. I have naturally oily skin, large pores, hormonal breakouts. This keeps my skin from breaking out. When I do break out, this makes them go away within one night! I wait 30 minutes, then use Oil of Olay moisturizer over it at night. In AM I use glycolic acid. Long-term use will pay off. Stay faithful.</li>
    <li> This is everything it is claimed to be! It completely turned the problems I was having with my skin around! Warning, though...IT IS STRONG! Be sure to consider the skin type you have and only \\&quot;baby step\\&quot; into the strength of this product. It comes in 1X - 3X. I recommend taking it slowly. I ordered the 3X right off the bat because I have a problem with my (age 55) skin sloughing off dead skin cells. This caused minor break-outs and dull skin. Literally, with one application of Affirm 3X, my skin felt different...AWESOME! It did make me peel like a snake skin though. I think I \\&quot;over did\\&quot; at first. Then when I backed off a little, I now have it working perfectly. I can see such a difference in my skin texture, smaller pores, completely cleared any problem areas I was having and I can see such a reduction in wrinkles already. I will definitely continue using this product.With the 3X strength I use it about twice weekly right now. I have also discovered an AMAZING, MIRACLE exfoliating cloth that I use at night to clean my face! Makes your face feel like baby skin. I LOVE IT, TOO! (Claroderm Micropeeling and Cleansing Cloth. You can get it on Amazon, too)</li>
    <li> I tried this product for several weeks and it did not work.  I will stick to my Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> I love Affirm 3x it is such a good retinol product. It makes my skin beautiful again and I got it for a great great price.</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old and have tried many products and this one does work.  I am not one to post false reviews and I do not get paid to endorse products-- I am simply a consumer that has had amazing results with this product. I use it daily and over the last several months have successfully watched several brown spots on my face disappear. This is the only product I will use now. I must admit, because of the money I have spent and the many products I have tried with no results, I was not expecting miracles from this one, but this one really DOES WORK and it does deliver results. I am a repeat customer and rate this as the best on the market!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they stopped making this!!! It worked as good if not better than rx .1 Tretinoins! Haven&#x27;t tried the 2x yet but based on 3x performance maybe I should.</li>
    <li> I had been using Tazorac for years, but when my husband became military it became very hard to get a prescription with his insurance.  This product works just as well if not better.  I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I go back and forth between this and Skinceuticals retinol. They are both wonderful. This one has a little more dimethicone in it, so it has a little bit more of a creamy/slippery feel to it than Skinceuticals, but it&#x27;s a wonderful product. Do allow your skin to get used to a retinol before you go crazy with it, though, because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is resurface you skin. It eliminated dark spots on my forehead, got rid of the beginning lines around my eyes. It will smooth deeper wrinkles to a degree, and will tighten skin. I highly recommend this, especially if you don&#x27;t want to pay Skinceuticals prices. It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
