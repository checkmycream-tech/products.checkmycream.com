<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have not finished these bottles before I tried another brand. This shampoo and conditioner dried my hair out. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product. Hair feels clean and has volume.</li>
    <li> Always a pleasure dealing with them</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo (actually, the whole line) for a year and two months. My hair is on the thinner side (not TOO thin) and very long. At first, I absolutely ADORED the products. They really do make your hair look shiny, reduce frizz, and they smell soooo good. But for some reason my hair just kept getting split ends....and I mean A LOT of split ends. Practically every strand had damage. I figured maybe it was because of hair health due to what I ate a long time ago when that hair was growing out. But trim after trim, it just kept happening! Finally, I started doing a lot of research on hair. The Marrakesh line has silicones. Silicones aren&#x27;t bad for everyone. They are great on some peoples&#x27; hair, but bad on others. They caused build up on my thinner hair, and the weight from that build up resulted in damage. However, I also believe that the silicones are what caused the shine and stopped the frizz. If you are prone to damage or have thin hair, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product. It&#x27;s a shame.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this product.  It smells great, isn&#x27;t heavey and of course being cruelty free-what more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Did not get hair growth samples.... but product just as described, shipping was fast. I really love how soft this makes my hair feel, my entire family use this product and our hair ranges from curly and course to straight and fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I was really really disjointed when I received this product. IT IS NOT THE REAL MARRAKESH PRODUCT. It left my hair dry and brittle. It also didn&#x27;t come with the extra conditioner packets as well. What a waste of money. I now have to go to get my hair deep conditioned to repair the damage left from this product. if your looking for the real thing don&#x27;t order for amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is soft straight and hydrated.  I love the smell, it reminds me if India</li>

    <li> Great hydration and smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo and conditioner. Smells incredible. Not too oily; leaves my hair shiny and soft. I will gladly pruchase it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent results with look and feel of hair.  Also has helped with scalp condition.</li>
    <li> I ordered a smaller size of this , and after 2 washes , I ordered this size..It is truly helping my hair , to grow , none or very little split ends  , I use the oils , and leave-in conditioner with this set...I also use the oil for my face , along with Flax seed { Lin Seed Oil } and Black Currant oil..One day I use one oil , both in morning and night , then rotate each oil , it is helping for sure , plus it helps to get longer use of oils , so don&#x27;t need to buy as often..Love this , on the packs , I&#x27;m giving to a friend of mine that has an issue with thin hair..Will be back..for sure..~!~</li>
    <li> I have fine limp hair and this set is wonderful for it. You do have to REALLY rinse the conditioner out or it will weigh down, if I rinse good I get super soft, bouncy, full hair. The smell is delicious, my husband is always sniffing my head telling me how much he loves this shampoo.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the smell of this product.  I, however, think it stinks.  That being said, the product didn&#x27;t do too much for my hair; however, I LOVED the samples they sent me along with this and I went to their website and purchased it.  If this doesn&#x27;t work well for you, try F.A.S.T. if you want rapid hair growth (it works), or try NISIM from the same company.  I LOVE that one for my hair.</li>
    <li> In the beginning I was ABSOLUTELY loving this hair product... becuase it has help the feeling of my hair, however it makes my hair really greasy and the growth rate its basically the same.</li>
    <li> Love the other oil but Hate these products. No lather and totally stripped my hair. Yuck. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Love the scent. My hair shines! Love the product</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a year now and it is fantastic. It keeps my very long hair smooth and untangled. It is fragrant and doesn&#x27;t promote dandruff.</li>
    <li> Love Marrakesh!!&lt;br /&gt;Can only order on amazon now. My beauty supply store went out of business that carried it.</li>
