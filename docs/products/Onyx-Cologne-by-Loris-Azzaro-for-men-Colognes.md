      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this cologne many times and am always pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this stuff</li>

      <li>I over heard the ladies at work talking about their favorite colognes and this was one of they suggested as great and affordable i purchased and have received several compliments and most importantly the wife likes it.</li>
      <li>My first though was that it smelled a bit soapy but after the first impression cleared up it was great and stuck around all day.</li>
      <li>Chrome Azzaro is the best: fresh scent that stays all day long.</li>

      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell too strong at first but the scent lingers.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is pleasant, smooth and casual.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was stated in the description.</li>
      <li>I have more expensive colognes that do not smell this good.</li>
      <li>Fast and quality product</li>
      <li>my husband has been wearing this for years and we have never bought a bottle that smelled this much like alcohol.</li>
      <li>It was the real deal.</li>
      <li>I recommend it for a gift or for any guy interested in a new cologne.</li>
      <li>Exactly what my boyfriend  wanted, this cologne last all day.</li>
      <li>This cologn seems old.</li>
      <li>Bought this blindly online and was very pleased with the product.  </li>
      <li>The smell is barely there.</li>
      <li>Because of this, it will not last as long or smell the exact same as the actual perfume which only has about 4% alcohol content.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife had said that a friends husbands cologne smelt good and I asked him what he wore. I ordered Chrome and Drakkar Noir and  my wife says the Chrome really works good on me. My first though was that it smelled a bit soapy but after the first impression cleared up it was great and stuck around all day. Its fresh and a great summer scent. I paid 34$, shipping included for this and it a great deal. I have more expensive colognes that do not smell this good.</li>
    <li> I now smell like success</li>
    <li> Exactly what was stated in the description. Came in a quick and timely manner. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this cologne many times and am always pleased with it. Please keep in mind that this is an EDT, or Eau de toilette, which means it has around 8% alcohol content. Because of this, it will not last as long or smell the exact same as the actual perfume which only has about 4% alcohol content.</li>
    <li> Chrome Azzaro is the best: fresh scent that stays all day long. I got so many compliments on this scent! You should buy it if you like fresh citric scents.</li>
    <li> Bought this cologne for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it! It&#x27;s a good lasting size &amp; the smell is amazing. I recommend it for a gift or for any guy interested in a new cologne.</li>

    <li> This cologn seems old. The smell is barely there. my husband has been wearing this for years and we have never bought a bottle that smelled this much like alcohol. I was excited about getting a good deal... but I think we just got ripped off. waste of money.</li>
    <li> Bought this blindly online and was very pleased with the product.  The smell is amazing, very masculine without being overpowering.  My husband has received numerous compliments on how good he smells.  Very satisfied.</li>
