      <li>i&#x27;ll just go buy a better trusted brand that i&#x27;m sure will get the job done.</li>

      <li>I was able to get my hair</li>

      <li>I love, love, love, love, LOVE this</li>
      <li>The one application I was able to use twice, it didn&#x27;t damage my hair at all if anything made it softer no hair fell off.</li>
      <li>and I love the results , over the summer I damaged my hair by going to the salon and wasting money</li>
      <li>SO glad I did!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure doing the procedure once more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did-</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff wish I can ordered some again</li>
      <li>again, the more I wash, the darker it looks.</li>
      <li>but I also applied it two more times.</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure why that happened.</li>
      <li>and I love how it looked.</li>
      <li>just make sure to leave it on for the maximum amount of time.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I could probably use it once more</li>
      <li>, i got great results and i highly recomended.</li>
      <li>and after I did my hd my hair was a very nice light brown at first</li>
      <li>Thanks MYHD for an amazing product!</li>
      <li>The best thing of all, it didn&#x27;t burn or itch, and it didn&#x27;t dry my hair up.</li>
      <li>Preparation/mixture of product was so easy, but the smell of rotten eggs &amp;#34;Yuck&amp;#34;, just make sure you don&#x27;t have a date coming over to visit that night.  </li>
      <li>and i was able to go a light brown.  </li>
      <li>so i used a permenent color that was \\&quot;intense red\\&quot; which i loved.</li>
      <li>I wish i would&#x27;ve done more significant research before making this purchase.</li>
      <li>and they all said it worked fine for them.</li>
      <li>it just didn&#x27;t keep it light brown</li>
      <li>Got the same results, great finish but</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s no longer available...</li>
      <li>I first tried Color Oops and had pretty good results</li>
      <li>Overall, I thought the product was overpriced and didn&#x27;t work very effectively.</li>
      <li>Completely impressed that it stripped 99 percent of the color in one go and left my hair soft!</li>
      <li>Loved this stuff because it actually works!</li>
      <li>to be fair - the product doesn&#x27;t claim to shift henna, so i was not misled as such, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes the color out quite quickly.</li>
      <li>But the product did get here quickly.</li>
      <li>It took me from bright red to golden brown</li>
      <li>I am getting married soon and needed a way to get my original hair color back, this was a good product.</li>
      <li>This worked great for me, I have dyed my hair almost every color I can imagine, black being my most recent and most unfavorable color.</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy this again, and will likely not need to spend $100+ to change my hair again before my wedding, so i am a happy camper :)</li>
      <li>This product worked very very well!</li>
      <li>I most likely wouldn&#x27;t use it again because I don&#x27;t think it worked that great on red hair.</li>
      <li>At the time I was very lucky that I didn&#x27;t get orange hair because I hadn&#x27;t really used any dyes to lighten my hair before adding pigment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>and I was ready with a box of John Frieda foaming color (light ASH brown)</li>
      <li>Best 20 dollars spent on getting my hair color back.</li>
      <li>This is definitely worth the money though</li>
      <li>But still worth it your hair isn&#x27;t fried</li>
      <li>I was actually looking to go to a nice copper color</li>
      <li>I sure will buy other one to make more lighter.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love this stuff wish I can ordered some again bout I have no idea when r coming back on stock</li>
    <li> TOTAL WASTE  OF MONEY DOES NOT WORK AT ALL! All it did was made my hair smell like rotten eggs and It&#x27;s been 5 days since I used it and still smells!!!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love, love, LOVE this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for a long quite a while now, and there are just some colors that I don&#x27;t like. I used to just bleach my hair to get the color out, and all it did was cause me a ton of damage. D: I had to cut my hair a bit shorter, a few inches off the shoulders - I hate it, but it&#x27;ll have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a few reviews of MYHD on youtube and they all said it worked fine for them. It&#x27;s a shame that not many people actually know about it. I used it just yesterday and it got my black hair to a light brown shade. :D I was very, very, very pleased. The best thing of all, it didn&#x27;t burn or itch, and it didn&#x27;t dry my hair up. Instead, it did the opposite. My hair feels softer, and a tad more shiny. I still have the two other bottles, but because I might end up using it again, I&#x27;m buying two more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes the color out quite quickly. When I used it to dye my hair a reddish brown, it ended up turning BLACK! So I thought, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll just use the rest of the bottle to see if I can get this fixed\\&quot;, and it did. I only left it on for around five minutes and washing it out, shampooing twice, then blow drying. MYHD is a fast working, color stripping product I&#x27;d use again any day if I had a hair color mistake. THANK YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t smell that bad at all either. It smelled like... Some sort of flower, or fruity. LOL.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving a 4 star Cuz it works awesome I just freaking HATE how it smells I sufered a whole 3 days with my hair smelling so bad!!</li>
    <li> Best color removal that I have ever used. It&#x27;s terrific! It works without major damage to hair compared to other products.</li>
    <li> It may have worked for some but it didn&#x27;t serve me any justice and the smell is not so great either.</li>
    <li> It made my hair a bit lighter, still had orange left, but not exactly what I wanted, though I would recommend it if you have many layers of dye in your hair and you&#x27;re trying to go lighter without using bleach</li>
    <li> My hair is a medium blonde.  I dyed it a medium auburn brown for the winter Holidays.  I used a Level 3 permanent hair color (box) from the grocery store.  I wanted to go back to my natural color.  I used the myHD product to try and remove the color.  It did lighten my hair and lift some of the color, but I ended up with an ugly orange dark blonde/light brown (REALLY orange).  My hair didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;damaged\\&quot; after using it.  The frangrance isn&#x27;t bad.  I went to Sally&#x27;s to find a toner to try and get the orange out.  They had several other hair color remover systems (wish I had thought about going to Sally&#x27;s first!) for much less $.  Not sure if they would have worked any better.  Overall, I thought the product was overpriced and didn&#x27;t work very effectively.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have dyed my hair no less than ever 2 months since I was 15.  I&#x27;ve ranged from using a blonde dye to achieve a really light brown (that never looks right) every shade up to black.  I actually have forgotten what shade of brown my hair really is naturally.  I&#x27;ve been using a dark brown for the past year or more and have been ready for a change... and thought maybe it&#x27;d be nice to  go back to natural for a bit and figure out where to go from there.&lt;br /&gt;After reading tons of reviews of this and color oops, and watching a ton of you tube videos and googling before and after pics galore, there was still no &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; decision.  I ended up ordering this product but I really can&#x27;t say why other than it just &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; right.  SO glad I did!!&lt;br /&gt;Like I said I really don&#x27;t remember what my natural shade is so I cant&#x27; say if this has restored me to my natural color or not, but it definitely took out the very dark brown dye.  My hair is now a light to med brown with lots of gold and red tones to it.  It is beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Ok now on to the review of the product itself (not the results)....&lt;br /&gt;The smell... was horrible when I was pouring bottle 1 and bottle 2, but after mixing them well it was not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle doesn&#x27;t say to but after it was on and the shower cap was on my head I microwaved a towel and wrapped that around my head as well... some review or video or something I saw/read said head increases results.&lt;br /&gt;The washing it out kills your hair... after 5 minutes of washing your hair feels seriously nasty.  Have a deep conditioner ready.&lt;br /&gt;I used the L&#x27;Oreal Ever Strong deep replenishing mask, and that worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about all I can say, it was not a terrible process, the results are great and I don&#x27;t feel the need to re-dye at this time (even thought the box says you can right away just choose a color 3 shades lighter than your desired result).</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t lift my dyed black hair after leaving it on for 45 min.  Thought it would do better but oh well.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do did take years of black off my hair but be careful if you have used metallic salts dye will cause chemical reaction but amazing left my hair super soft</li>
    <li> Works great at removing color.....black turned to a nice aburn with only one twenty min application.....the downside the first day after using it your hair smells very funcky....kinda like cornchips. But still worth it your hair isn&#x27;t fried</li>
    <li> It worked pretty good, but I had red hair and it did take a lot of the red out but there was still a lot of red left. It also made my hair very brassy. I most likely wouldn&#x27;t use it again because I don&#x27;t think it worked that great on red hair. I would suggest that if you have red hair to really think about using this product.</li>
    <li> Removed most of the black. Did not damage or dry out my hair either. I would use this product again.</li>
    <li> Used this product twice.  Did not remove the color from my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this a few years ago after having layer upon layer of black hair dye. I mean YEARS of black, at least 3-4 and I dyed at least once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff was amazing, and a single packet removed it all! At the time I was very lucky that I didn&#x27;t get orange hair because I hadn&#x27;t really used any dyes to lighten my hair before adding pigment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People need to understand your hair WILL get brassy tones etc from a stripper, this is not the fault of the stripping product, your hair gets lightened by the dyes you&#x27;ve used to allow the colour to enter the hair shaft, so when you strip the colour, you actually see the lightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff and have been searching like crazy to find it again, as for some reason it&#x27;s no longer available...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to be devastated if after writing this, and going to the checkout, it doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other brands but like this the most</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING. The smell is horrible but the product is wonderful. I dyed my hair dark brown about three times and it almost completely lifted it . I had colored my light blonde hair a dark blonde color about a year earlier and it turned out GREEN! My ends have been green ever since but now the green is gone! I could probably use it once more but it takes a while to get here. Im going to the salon on saturday to get it back to my natural hair color. Now that my hair is lighter it wont get as damaged when I highlight it. There was absolutely NO damage. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Let me start of by saying that \\&quot;once you go black, you never go back\\&quot; is a lie! For years, approx. 6 I had been dying my hair black. Constantly. I was a bit skeptical at first trying this, but it works! It realllllly does. My hair is a pretty mahogany brown, which I might leave by the way. I definitely recommend this product. Thank you SO much Aveyou!</li>
    <li> Great product, smells good not like other products, removed a black color off my hair with only one box. Great</li>
    <li> LOOOOOVE IT. I had purple hair and it took me back to my natural blonde no problem! great great great stuff</li>
    <li> I have to give a little back story before I review, I have been dying my hair black for 2+ years. I had it black then got blonde highlights, and then went black again. After so many times dying my hair black I got sick of it, and was looking for a quick way to get it out. I bought myhd, not expecting any spectacular results. I had already used a cheaper version that really didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. So I bought this and followed the directions on the box, and it lightened my hair enough so that now I can finally do something different with my hair! I&#x27;m actually very impressed. It wasn&#x27;t a total lightening. The ends of my hair are slightly darker than the roots because there&#x27;s more hair dye built up there, but it&#x27;s so slight, that unless you&#x27;re a nitpicker, you can&#x27;t really notice. So I would recommend it for any hair color you&#x27;re trying to get out of your hair. I should say though that the longer you wait to do it, the less results you get in the color change.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a non damaging way to remove color. Ive used other products that turned my hair green and blue and no matter what I did unless I used red to cover the blue it would not go away. This product removed even the blue and green that was over a year old. It was a gift.</li>
    <li> The product did work but the after smell it leaves on your hair was horrible.  The smell does go away after a week or two.</li>
    <li> I found this on youtube and saw that it worked for women trying to get rid of their Black hair dye so I thought I would try it and I ordered it and when it finally came I did it that very same day. my hair was clean and it had no other product it. they were definitely right its has a horrible smell during and a little after you are done but I didn&#x27;t mind it very much.my hair was very dark I had dyed it probably a month ago black and after I did my hd my hair was a very nice light brown at first and I love how it looked. however the next day I took a shower at night and noticed that my hair got darker so I wasn&#x27;t sure why that happened. I tried looking at the box to see if I had missed a step or wasn&#x27;t supposed to wash my hair for a couple of days but didn&#x27;t see any directions for that part. So my hair is still brown however it went from a very light brown that I wanted to just a dark brown which is I guess better than having the dark black hair I had. So all in all if I can give this a three-and-a-half I would but it did its job by removing the black it just didn&#x27;t keep it light brown like I wanted it. maybe I just needed to do it twice so either way I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> loved!! my hair was black forever, I don&#x27;t want to use bleach to do not  damage my hair, after read the review I decide to purchase this product  ,it  is truel!!  in 20-25 minutes my hair change from black 3 to median-light brown and my hair still the same without damage.  recommended and I sure will buy other one to make more lighter.</li>
    <li> This worked great for me, I have dyed my hair almost every color I can imagine, black being my most recent and most unfavorable color. Being that I dye it a lot I was very afraid to strip the color out. I read and youtubed reviews for the myhd color remover and found that people said it worked and left your hair looking pretty healthy overall. They were right, I bought one box and also a color comb and bowl to mix it in. The first application I did I noticed a difference but I also applied it two more times. My color is now a light brown color and my hair still feels great. I was also able to do all three of those applications with just one box and my hair length is well past my shoulders. Best 20 dollars spent on getting my hair color back. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Did not work well on dreadlocks on my sister&#x27;s African hair.  Saw the video on caucasian/arabic hair and results were good.  I have also bought for me to lighten the color of my natural-nappy hair.  Hope it will work.</li>
    <li> This product did more color removal the first time than it did the second time, and if you have natural dark brown hair do not try to dye your hair a blonde box dyeit will turn it back brown! I even waited the suggested amount of time to re dye it!</li>
    <li> I am naturally blonde and have been box-dying my hair (almost) black for about 6 years. I was actually looking to go to a nice copper color so this product was perfect for me. It stripped the black from my hair within 20 minutes. I even left it on for 30 minutes to get it as light as possible. I washed my hair twice, like the directions state, and it worked. My hair turned out to be the perfect shade of copper and was a nice even color all over without looking brassy. I may be crazy but it seems like the more I wash my hair, the darker it gets. I ordered another MYHD a week later and did it again. Got the same results, great finish but again, the more I wash, the darker it looks. I feel like it&#x27;s going back to brown. Was wondering if anyone else experienced this?</li>
    <li> very black very very black bin dieing for years  and it didnt even come close to doing any thing to my ends</li>
    <li> item arrived on time. i like how it works, i got great results and i highly recomended.</li>
    <li> I did three applications, it lightened the top and mid portions of my hair, to different degrees, and within a few days it was back to black.  Also, it dried out my hair.  I have been doing conditioning treatments ever since in an attempt to salvage some of the damage.  I shake my head at the idiocy of it all - I paid to damage my hair, in essence, because it&#x27;s exactly the same colour as before I used the product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works better or just as good as salon products! Would definetly buy again.</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff because it actually works! It is a little pricey but its better than the other stuff out there and the smell was not too offensive.  It stripped out years of dark brown to black dye and i was able to go a light brown.  It did not destroy my hair either.  Would definitely use again!</li>
    <li> I loved it &amp; I mean I am in love with my hair! For almost a year I have been dying my hair a strong red every month and about 2 months ago I dyed my hair black and I regretted it for so long, I used this on my hair and it went back to brown, my natural color, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the whole application smelled pretty bad and it took 2 times in order for my whole head to go back, but other than that it was perfect ! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I have seen reviews for this product, and it worked on darker hair, but I had a dark true red. I thought I would speed up the process of letting myself go gray, but this product only made it look Orange! So, if it doesn&#x27;t work for reds, it should state that. Threw $25 down the drain - literally.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t take the dye out and it smelled really bad. But the product did get here quickly.</li>
    <li> Did not really work for me.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair all the shades n colors of the rainbow you can think of but i always go back to black only later to regret it, my hair is beyond damaged so stripping just wasn&#x27;t an option. It had been over 4 months since i last put a soft black in my hair so i have a few inches of natural growth/color in addition to not dying it i have been using a clarifying poo&#x27; by neurtrogena;anti-residue as well as doing vitamin C treatments so there is some fading on the ends, so i have bern preparing to lighten up &amp; After research i decided to give My hd a try. 2 applications later my hair lifted about a quarter of a shade, this stuff smells like buffalo behind, i had to throw out my towels shirt n spent iver 3 hours rinsing, washing, repeat x8 and it just didn&#x27;t do much. It seemed to Jane darkened the following days post treatment. Im now going to try color oops which is less than half the price of myHD IN addition to bring more affordable its also accessible, you can find it at must drug stores, great you tube reviews/tutorials ... I wish i would&#x27;ve done more significant research before making this purchase. Its been a waste of my time and money, with that being said do buy at your own discrepancy but be prepared for disappointment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde who for the last 5 years who has gone black or red and highlights. I just got done with I use (I still have one use left I have shoulder length hair) and I was amazed! My roots came back bright blonde while most of the black came to a dense coppery brown. It isn&#x27;t that bad. I will be using again before I find a shade to stay with to help lift out the rest of the dark. I&#x27;ll update as I go. The smell is like spoiled eggs gag! But I can deal with it for this outcome. Stink is beauty!</li>
    <li> It Removed my black hair color out like it said. I only had to do it one time and it turned to a brown color! Except your hair will stink like rotten eggs for a week or so. Also You will need to deep condition after this product!</li>
    <li> It will take out a CONSIDERABLE amount of color.  But ladies who have been covering grays, remember that it will be taking your color down to close to what it REALLY is....not a lighter version of the died color.  It works harder on the fresher bits...the closest 2 inches to my scalp were almost back to white (it was the first time in years I had gotten a look at how white I was now). It took the color on the ends lighter, but they were still brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using this on hair colored over grays to get rid of some of the buildup like I did, just know you&#x27;ll have to have a box of hair dye at the ready to color the orangy white hairs that will be revealed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It took all the dye out of my hair. I use permanent hair color. Very impressed. No damage either. My hair felt great afterwards!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product, because I&#x27;ve used other brands of color removers before and didn&#x27;t get the result that I wanted. But after watching YouTube videos detailing this product, I decided to take the plunge. I&#x27;m glad I did- it stripped my hair color without damage, and I used it twice to get the result I wanted. The smell is the only problem- it left my hair a little smelly for a week, but it&#x27;s back to normal now. I recommend trying this product out if you want to strip your permanent hair dye.</li>
    <li> My natural hair is a dark brown and I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair raven black for years.Now I wanted to remove the black and go with a lighter shade.I first tried Color Oops and had pretty good results BUT after 3-4 days color was back on LOL.&lt;br /&gt;  MyHD...it turned my roots to an orange shade, the middle of my head to a brown while the most of it is still black.It doesn&#x27;t stinks to me and it didn&#x27;t damage my hair either but just didn&#x27;t work...</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works :) was able to take the black out of my hair</li>
    <li> As soon as i had heard that it wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair i was interested.&lt;br /&gt;But as soon as i had put it on i already doubted what i was doing.&lt;br /&gt;First of all it smells horrible, at first it smells like mango then into just plain awful. But i had thought since it was starting to smell bad that something would happen to my hair. My hair is a light faded blue &amp; a very faded purple so i thought it would come out very easily. Nothing at all happened, my hair smelled bad for about 3 days. It didn&#x27;t make any sense that it wouldn&#x27;t work, my hair has been faded for a long time &amp; there wasn&#x27;t a single difference other than the smell. Even other color removers actually give you what you paid for. i&#x27;ll just go buy a better trusted brand that i&#x27;m sure will get the job done.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff! It didn&#x27;t damage my hair, and took out all the black ❤️</li>
    <li> It actually works, I immediately saw the difference in color and texture of my hair.  Preparation/mixture of product was so easy, but the smell of rotten eggs &amp;#34;Yuck&amp;#34;, just make sure you don&#x27;t have a date coming over to visit that night.  Keep the windows open cause, it smells like someone farted.  I was amazed that it only took 20 minutes and not 45, and had enough to cover my long hair which stops at the waist line, medium thickness.  Make sure you have a bottle of hair dye, cause it also exposes your grey hairs OMG, I never knew I have tons of it!&lt;br /&gt;The down fall is it&#x27;s only available to purchase online, but delivery with this seller was fast, I&#x27;d do this again.</li>
    <li> This hair color remover works!!! I dyed my hair an intense red that faded to almost pink after 4 washes, my hd strip out all of the red leaving my hair color to a light golden brown color (natural color dark brown). The only thing is that it didn&#x27;t really strip out my black patches of hair from when I dyed it the intense red, it lighten a lil, but not to match the rest of my hair which turned light brown. I had ombré hair before this so bottom half was bleached and my growth took to the red but the in btwn stayed black. The one application I was able to use twice, it didn&#x27;t damage my hair at all if anything made it softer no hair fell off. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This did take some of the color out of my hair but not to the level that I expected. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! I use it every time I decide to go from one extreme to the other. It works great.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve been coloring my hair black for years . I wanted to go lighter, so I tried myhd. I was amazed how even this product removed the existing color without damage, The only thing I was baffled  about was that it seemed to darken a little in a couple of days, I thought that was strange, but all in all, I recommend  mhd over strip bleaching any day.</li>
    <li> If you need to redye your hair and its too dark this would work nicely, but it seemed to damage my hair a bit, to almost a straw-like feel. I had wanted to dye my hair back to a normal color and used this to get rid of the dye off my hair, but it just seemed to EXTREMELY lighten the color from a light brown to almost a blonde color. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that and it looked like it damaged the softness of my hair to a large degree, but if you want to get your hair to a lighter shade then this works almost like bleach.</li>
    <li> Barley lifted any color out of my hair...</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this product. I had hear mixed things about it so I figured the only way to know for sure was to do it myself. Prior to using this I had dyed my hair black twice this year and once red over top the black (stupid idea). I left the hair color remover on for 25 mins and all the black is gone and my hair is brown again I was so happy. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell and that my hair was a little dry after but not too much. This is definitely worth the money though</li>
    <li> I have used ColorZap before and it fried my hair and turned it a god awful orange color. I did a lot of research before buying this product. The only awful thing I do to my hair is usually dye it, and I use a lot of reds and dark browns. This stuff worked like magic for me multiple times. I put pink in my hair and mess it up badly, and this took it all out as well. Works like a charm, but it does smell kinda funky for a bit.</li>
    <li> The next day my hair was back to the dark color I wanted to get rid off???why???</li>
    <li> I had dyed my hair with reddish semi-permenent colors (natural instincts) for a long time... then the red started getting darker so i used a permenent color that was \\&quot;intense red\\&quot; which i loved. after being over the BRIGHT fire engine red, i thought id go back to my natural color of Piss water blond/ very light brown. This stuff pulled ALL of the RED out... it was amazing. unfortunately the permanent color used a developer so my hair was that awful orangey blond horrible color, but I had been prepared for it and I was ready with a box of John Frieda foaming color (light ASH brown) that matched my natural hair color and now it looks beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;myhd. My Haidresser Salon Professional Do-It-Yourself Permanent Hair Colour Remover works very very well getting the most intense red colors out, just be prepared to put a color back INTO your hair. The ASH really resists the red from coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair didnt feel silky smooth right after the treatment, but a few days later of using the Aussie 3 minute miracle repair, its  back to normal shine and bounce.</li>
    <li> This item is great it worked for me</li>
    <li> The product did what it was supposed to so but it didn&#x27;t really work the way it said it was going to work. Some of my permanent hair color came out but not all, my permanent hair color just ended up coming back to black.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions. It did not work. I even tried twice as noted in the instructions and still did not work.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Didn&#x27;t get any of the color out of my hair at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money, it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I am a natural blonde, dyed my hair black for about 2years then recently decided to grow my hair out. Well as you can imagine 6 months goes by and I have blonde roots with black hair. I bought this product applied twice and not even one shade lighter??? And yes the dye used was permanent. So disappointing!!!</li>
    <li> Did not work, had to go to a proffessional, an use bleach because black dye. May work for blonde or red who knows.</li>
    <li> Wasted money on this product, ruined my hair and paid more at the salon to get corrective coloring. Will never recommend this product and no one should risk ruining their hair like I did. Just go to a professional. I used this after watching a few you tube videos and reading the reviews. The reviews were 50/50 so I took the risk thinking I could save myself some money. I followed the directions and applied twice like it recommended. It stripped my roots 5 inches back from my root and the rest stayed black. It turned my roots gray, brown, copper and orange! My hair is naturally ashy black and I&#x27;ve been going gray along my bangs and temples since I was 18. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair natural black with a variety of different brands for 6 years. I was hoping to lift the dye out of my hair but it was a hot mess. The only positive thing I have to say about this products is it left my hair silky smooth and super soft for a few days. PLEASE DON&#x27;T USE! You&#x27;ll be calling the salon for an emergency appointment and paying way more in the long run.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for 2 years constantly and red has been my choice of color I bought this because I wanted to go chestnut Brown and let the tell you the product smells AWFUL make sure not to get it on anything you like because you might have to throw it away...but after I used it it turned my hair the color it was way back when I first started dying it I thought I was going to get my natural hair color back which is almost black but no... I didn&#x27;t the good thing is I was able to get my hair the color I wanted with highlights! So I rate decent not impressed but definitely happy I was able to get the hair color I wanted.</li>
    <li> This product worked very very well! I had some doubts because my hair was jet black for the past years and it definitely lightened it up in less then 20 minutes! I used the product one more times since you are allowed 3 times and it was a nice Brown if you want to color it again with permanent hair say light Brown get a blonde color otherwise it won&#x27;t really show but this product was overall freaking sweet!</li>
    <li> I used this 4 times (my hair is thin and I did not need much each time, so 1 bottle was enough for 4 applications). my hair is significantly lighter - i had dyed it black for 2 years. It does only work to a certain extent. my hair is no longer black, but it is more coppery than my normal light brown. this is because of the dye, not this product. I am getting married soon and needed a way to get my original hair color back, this was a good product. If you need to redye your hair for an event however, do it at least 3 months before hand just in case you need a professional when it&#x27;s done. I spaced the applications out over 4 weeks, and this worked best i think, rather than 2 and 2 as the bottle suggests. I would definitely buy this again, and will likely not need to spend $100+ to change my hair again before my wedding, so i am a happy camper :)</li>
    <li> Had my hair red for years, got tired of dying mu hair so I got this to strip what I can to go back to my natural ash blonde. Worked great, stripped out the red and made it easier to tone my hair to its proper color.</li>
    <li> I liked this product a lot!!! I had dyed my hair black for a few years and wanted to change to a light brown. I had to apply the product twice to remove years of black hair. It is a slow process but it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as if you do it at a salon. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell!!! But after two weeks approximately it&#x27;s gone! 👍👍👍</li>
    <li> hate it.. didnt remove past hair color but just fried my hair....waste of money</li>
    <li> best product I have ever used to remove hair dye. It took me from bright red to golden brown</li>
    <li> I am so impressed by this product; I honestly did not think it would work very well, but I was willing to give anything a try. My natural hair color is a dark-ish golden brown. Last year I wanted it dyed bright red, but the hair lady messed up and dyed my hair a very dark burgundy. A different woman stripped my hair of all color (turning it a coppery blonde), before dying it bright red. I dyed it every few weeks to maintain the color for about 4 months. After this I dyed my hair completely black which I kept for a few more months. The black had faded a bit but was still very dark. I wanted to get back to my natural brown, and my roots had grown in about 3 inches. I followed the instructions and mixed Part A and Part B equally. I let it sit for about 25 minutes instead of 20 and rinsed it out and shampooed twice and then left in a leave in conditioner (I shampooed with Not Your Mother&#x27;s Long Hair Shampoo and used Not Your Mother&#x27;s detangler leave in conditioner spray if anyone is wondering). It completely removed all traces of black and the only difference you can see between the lifted color and my roots is a slight red tint. I&#x27;m sure doing the procedure once more would&#x27;ve completely taken out all leftover color, but it&#x27;s so unnoticeable that it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered, and in the sun it looks a bit ombre! It smells kinda funky, but the smell wears off really soon and isn&#x27;t unbearable by any means. Also, my hair feels exactly the same as it always does--no damage! Completely impressed that it stripped 99 percent of the color in one go and left my hair soft! Thanks MYHD for an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product a few times and I love the results , over the summer I damaged my hair by going to the salon and wasting money and I still didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted . So when I came across this product I did research on it and I finally ordered it so ever since the first time I used it I LOVED the results !! And I actually kept the color ! But it&#x27;s an Amazing product and the good thing about it is that it does not damage your hair &lt;3</li>
    <li> I knew going into this that it probably would not work on my black hair, but I had hope because I don&#x27;t die my entire head once a month - just my roots. However, 3 bottles later, and the only difference was my roots were light brown fading to red fading to black. This product did nothing for the rest of my hair - just the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refused to bleach my hair, and I could not spend years with ugly hair, so I&#x27;m back to black.&lt;br /&gt;...I don&#x27;t know why I even tried to go back to my natural hair color after having gorgeous black hair again.</li>
    <li> i bought this product because i had read on a forum somewhere that it would help to remove henna from hair.&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t really do much for me though. to be fair - the product doesn&#x27;t claim to shift henna, so i was not misled as such, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. i was over-optimistic......it has some good reviews on other types of coloured hair though.</li>
    <li> Did not remove enough color from my length even with 2 applications, but Lightened my natural roots to a very light orange color and smelled horrible. I ended up having to dye my roots back to the same dark color that was left on my lengths. Would not use this products again it was a waste of time.</li>
    <li> smelled awful, lighten it some not to natural color, but went back color we started with within a week. and there was only enough for one application in one box.</li>
    <li> Ok so my rating is based on the fact that not only did this product damaged my hair but also did not do what it was supposed to do. I have long curly black hair and lots of it and have been dying my hair black for a few years. I&#x27;ve always used permanent hair color and recently added a a few caramel highlights to it. I should&#x27;ve left it at that but I wanted to lighten my hair for the summer and stumbled upon this product. I used one package as directed and it did not lighten my hair at all. In fact it left my hair very weak and brittle and even my brother noticed it and commented how my hair looked fragile! I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product abd I regret that I even tried it. I&#x27;ve tried using several deep conditioning treatments and my hair still remains dry, brittle and weak. This product should be taken off the market period! Stay away from it</li>
    <li> I should have purchased this right after I got my hair colored&lt;br /&gt;and I believe it would have taken out the color. I waited 6 months&lt;br /&gt;so it was too late to remove the color. But, it will work for you it&lt;br /&gt;you just made a mistake and colored your hair the wrong color&lt;br /&gt;and wanna remove it.</li>
    <li> I had done my research on this and many other permanant hair color remover products, but was still skeptical. I have been coloring my hair for several years various shades of red - for the most part, dark, vibrant shades of red. I got to the point that I am tired of the upkeep and the fact that red fades so quickly so, wanting a change without having to spend so much at a salon, I decided to give myhd a try. It actually does work! The smell is not as bad as some say. It isn&#x27;t roses, but it is manageable. I would just suggest doing this in a well ventilated room, possibly with an open window. I started with a darker red (it had faded some &amp; my roots had grown out a little, so I was not all one color). I did do the treatment twice and I ended with a orangish blonde and am now all one color. I am going to wait the suggested 48 hours before recoloring. But I definitely would recommend this product and I can it does work. My hair feels slightly drier than before I did this, but with some corrective shampoo and leaving in conditioner, it will be back to normal in no time.</li>
    <li> Hair product works great.  It does not fry your hair because there is no bleach in the product.  IT works great just make sure to leave it on for the maximum amount of time.</li>
    <li> Color turned back to black in matter of days!! You should probably rinse thoroughly, but for me it did nothing. Still had to bleach and die. So no magic in this product as presented :(</li>
    <li> The smell is as bad as other user say!  I used it on my daughters hair in the basement bathroom and we could still smell it faintly in the second floor of the house.  It smells like perm mixed with rotten egg/ skunk.. Not very pleasant.  She has naturally red hair and dyed 1/2 of it black with permanent dye.  The dye had been done monthly for about six months but she grew bored with it.  We did 1/2 her head twice and her hair has &amp;#34; lightened&amp;#34; to a mahogany red.  Its still very dark but the upside is the product did not damage her hair AT ALL!  You cannot tell the difference &amp;#34; texture wise&amp;#34; on which side was treated.  A word of advice, you do have to almost &amp;#34; scrub&amp;#34; the hair together to remove the color it doesn&#x27;t rinse out without it.  I will be purchasing again to see if we can get the shade a bit lighter.  For the price, the size could be bigger and the bottles should be clear so you can see how much product is left if doing more than one application.  Use gloves and a towel you can toss in the trash, same goes for the shirt the person is wearing while the hair is processing.  Good luck all!</li>
