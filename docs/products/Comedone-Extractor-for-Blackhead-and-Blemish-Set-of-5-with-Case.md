<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome product. Bought it for my teenager.</li>
    <li> I had to wait until I got a blemish to be able to review this item.  When I did...wow!  This product is able to release the infection from your blemish without leaving marks all over your body.  It does a great job!!</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t think it would but this kit actually comes in handy when attempting the to get rid of blemishes/pimples/blackheads. The tools are great quality material and were manufactured well.  No complaints with shipping or the product.</li>
    <li> Strong, well made stainless steel tools that are fitted into a high quality zip case. Totally professional in appearance and construction.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Used this on a 6 year long black head. It took some time but we eventually got it and no scars and no torn skin. Tools are incredibly sturdy easy to clean. Do the job well!! Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Used this kit on a small cyst on my stomach area. Worked like a charm!! Be sure to follow the directions &amp; sanitize everything. It also helps to go to YouTube &amp; watch others extract blackheads &amp; the like. Thanks, Crave Naturals, for an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I love this set, they are very easy to use, and come in a great zipper case. There are different types and sizes, and they are not painful to use. They make getting rid of blackheads and blemishes, so much easier. I use them after washing my face, because my pores are open, so it is easier for the oil to come out. Highly recommend this set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item complimentary for review purposes. All opinions are purely my own*</li>
    <li> Crave Naturals blackhead remover is amazing the tools are easy to use. I have lots of white heads and black also now it is easy for me to remove them.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try a few of these extractors. I only have the &amp;#34;loop&amp;#34; one from the drug store. The others are similar and work pretty much the same as the one from the drug store. It&#x27;s good to have just in case I would ever need the lancet. I would recommend this product to others though. The tools are well made and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great tools and quality.</li>
    <li> This kit works just fine..</li>
    <li> arrived promptly; seems to work well</li>
    <li> Great product.  Excellent assortment of tools</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit for a friend who has some recurring blackheads.  It is perfect for him.  The selection of tools helps remove these safely and more comfortably.  The case helps him keep all of the tools together, otherwise he would loose them.  A great product.</li>
    <li> I have tried facial scrubs, masks, my own home brew of this type of witchcraft. Nothing works effectively but this toolkit. The other products can loosen the debris in your pores, but this really gets it out. I can tell my pores are clear on my chin where I used it. On sensitive areas like the nose it would be nice to have a more delicate tool in this kit... hence the minus one star. All things considered, still a great product.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery  and tools are awesome</li>
    <li> Awesome little blemish remover set. We love it, great product, at a great price!</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 5 stars. It works great, and I feel like an old timey doctor when I pull it out to go to work. The only thing that&#x27;s missing is a bottle of ether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband, however, gives this product no stars. I assume because he dislikes when I climb on his back and go to work on his black heads.</li>
    <li> These work great for very difficult and large blackheads.</li>
    <li> This kit comes with a variety of sizes, which is nice. I have issues with ingrown hairs, and these instruments do a great job removing the head and bulb.</li>
    <li> It arrived missing one of the tools. Despite that, it seems to be an ok product.</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t seem to have great edges. More smooth than sharp-ish like you need to properly apply pressure without pressing too hard</li>
    <li> I am in love with this set. Not only does it work great, but it comes in an awesome little case too! I have tried blemish removers before, but these are definitely my favorite. This set has a bunch of different sizes, angles and even a sharp point tool! You are sure to find one that works when you need it. So far not only have the tools not become tarnished in any way, but they also still work like the day I got them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my favorite tool is the angled tool because it really does get to those hard to reach places. Every once and a while I get a blackhead in my ear and it will drive me nuts for weeks if not months. With this tool I am able to get rid of it fast and without the extra pain of not being able to get it with my fingers. This is definitely a must have set for anyone that deals with acne on a regular basis. It really is amazing and I am glad that I got to test out this product for free!</li>
    <li> Thank you . it&#x27;s just what I thought it to be maybe even better</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. No problems with the set.</li>
    <li> These tools are very well-made, and they work well to remove blackheads. I like having a nice case in which to store the tools when not in use. It keeps them clean and prevents a tool from getting lost. I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> They are interesting but haven&#x27;t fully gotten the hang of using them. I got these for a review as my kids have acne issues so gave them to them to use. Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement as yet but not sure if using right</li>
    <li> nice product. Well made and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;m a guy and for years I&#x27;ve had blackheads on my nose. I had mild acne that was annoying as a teenager, but now that I am in my early twenties my skin is flawless except for the blackheads on my nose. I tried using biore nose strips, but could never get more than a few blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has allowed me to remove years of built up blackheads. My nose looks great and my pores are noticeably a lot smaller. It took me a few times to completely remove all of them, but I feel so much better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine: I steam my face over the sink for 10 minutes while my tools disinfect in alcohol. Then I start to remove them with the mirror. Be careful, you don&#x27;t want to me too harsh. If your skin starts bleeding or looks really bad then you&#x27;re going too hard. Just experiment and see what works for you. After a couple of minutes I turn on my shower on full heat, close the doors, and let the bathroom steam up. This works super well! Put a little bit of shaving cream on your mirror, rub it in, and wipe off with a tissue. This will prevent your mirror from fogging up. Afterwards I wash my nose in cold water, disinfect my nose with rubbing alcohol, wait a couple of minutes, and then put on a serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool works perfectly and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wishes to have a clear nose and smaller pores.</li>
    <li> This tool set came to me in the white case pictured but one of my tools had ripped through the top of the case and the white had a big black circle mark on it, kind of gross. The tools are not useful and you have to use some much force that it hurts and/or bruises your skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone and I should have bought one more expensive higher quality tool than a few useless cheaper ones.</li>
    <li> Good quality skin care set.  Nice case.  Have wanted a set for a long time, for when I can&#x27;t get to the professional.  Worked great with steam and gentle use for black head removal.</li>
    <li> I love this set i put it to use as soon as i got acne is running rampant in my house right now so a lot of bumps getting popped and with this set it it going to be way easier my son is in love with the lancet because he he can just pop the bump with out having to squeeze it and leave marks on your face  the black head remover is in such great demand around here because there seem to be one somewhere that needs to taken care. This is a great set to get for a teenager going thru the acne minefield as it will help them take better care of their skin, it is a must have for your cosmetics case because breakout happen anytime and this is great to help you take care of all of them.  I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW AFTER USING IT.</li>
    <li> This kit is great for clearing your face and removing any blemishes and imperfections. It has so many tools to remove anything from zits, to blackheads, to whiteheads and comes in a nice storage case. I found this kit very effective in removing zits and when used properly, I was able to prevent the zits from coming back since it could be used to remove any excess dirt left in my pores. Make sure to either apply a warm wet washcloth to your face or take a shower before using these tools to make the process easier and to prevent redness.</li>
    <li> They really work great.  Fast, easy to use. All appropriate sizes in a very nice zipper case.  My husband has many blackheads on his back and these instruments work quickly and effectively.  No more pain!  Wish I had these a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Must be me, but these don&#x27;t work at all.  Just another set of gadgets for me.</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting some kind of miracle pimple popper, but this has been less effective than using my fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a problem with the quality, just the overall effectiveness and design.</li>
    <li> Do you fight with acne and blackheads? Looking for an effective way to help get rid of it? Crave Naturals has the perfect solution to help get rid of acne, blackheads and whiteheads safely without damaging your skin. Using your fingers will only cause bacteria form and will make your skin issues even worse than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crave Naturals Blemish Tool Removal Kit comes with everything you need to make your skin look healthier. You get 5 professional quality, 100% stainless steel instruments on one convenient white leather travel kit. These tools resists rust, staining and corrosion. The kit includes: 1 Lancet/Spoon Extractor, 3 Loop (Comedone) Extractors and 1 Angled Extractor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face usually breaks out with one huge pimple every couple of weeks. This kit has definitely come in handy for me. I remember using what I called a &#x27;pimple popper&#x27; when I was younger. It looked almost like the spoon extractor. It was probably an old fashioned style as my grandmother had given it to me over 30 years ago. Of course I don&#x27;t have it to this day but I do remember using it and that I loved it. So I was excited to get the opportunity to try this kit so it could help me tackle my acne again. I always hate using my fingers to pop my pimples because it just adds more dirt and grease and causes more skin problems. I highly recommend Crave Naturals Blemish Tool Removal Kit. The instruments come in a travel size, white leather zipper pouch. It&#x27;s even small enough to carry in your purse. The kit also comes with instructions and a $5 coupon code for any Crave Naturals product. I received this product to test in exchange for my hones, unbiased opinion. This is an amazing kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tackle your skin problems with this dermatologist approved blemish banishing kit. Crave Naturals also offer a lifetime guarantee so you have nothing to lose other than those horrible pimples and blackheads!</li>
    <li> Very professional instrumentation.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice set of facial tools. They are great quality as well.  I also love the packaging. It is very convenient for travel as well. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this!  First time using this type of tool.  Great quality, arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Well made and gives you many choices to use.</li>
    <li> This is a product with great quality for a good price! The tools are all stainless steel, easy to clean, and have nice weighting in the handles to provide for ease of use. Each tool is very well made, and it is nice to have a variety of extractors for different types of pimples. It takes a little bit of practice to know which extractor type to use on different types of blemishes, but once you know what works typically you are good to go! I really like the case; it is small and nicely made with a zipper open/close. Many beauty products are poorly made and still cost a high price, which is why I was impressed with this set. It delivers five tools that are well made along with a nice to case to hold them in for an awesome price. I highly recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> I love these they are super sturdy and get to even the stubbornest of pimples/blackheads i love that they are versatile and just a really nice set</li>
    <li> I thought I might use this more than I actually have.  The tools kind of hurt.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and so easy to use!It comes in a cute case for easy storage.It has no slip grip so it&#x27;s easy to use and won&#x27;t slip from your hands.It has different tools to choose from,not sure if I need them all but the ones I haven&#x27;t used might come in handy later.i would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> The edges were too sharp; not smoothed out.</li>
    <li> I like the product very much. It is a high quality kit with multipurpose items. The packaging is great and the shipment arrived super fast. It is definitely worth the price. The tweezers come in different sizes and shapes, but you need to be careful and gentle when using the them. If you push too hard they are going to leave an impression.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It works great on all my blackheads, whiteheads and blemishes. I will be spending a lot of time in front of my magnifying mirror with this kit!</li>
    <li> A little over priced... You can get most of the tools at walmart or cheaper. I gave this 4 stars, because I love love love the piercing tool. I have used it many times for ingrown hairs. Everything else just &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Quality set that comes in a very well constructed case</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed getting the chance to review this product and test it out so far ive had a couple of blemishes and blackheads and using this kit really does the job</li>
    <li> I guess I am not good as using it. It doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, or if this set is difficult to use.  When they work they work very well, but they only work one out of 5 times.</li>
    <li> It was exactly at posted and works great</li>
    <li> This blackhead removes whitehead &amp; blackheads on my husbands&#x27; back quickly.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Grandaughter.</li>
    <li> The package was quite disappointing when it arrived; it was not as cute as the picture makes it seem and the tools were not in their straps and arrived all scratched up.</li>
    <li> The outer portion of the case feels like it will tear/peel due to it being pleather. However the tools are pretty solid and provides a great variety for all your blemish removing needs. Also not mentioned or shown is that the case provides an inside protective flap that separates the metal tools from rubbing each other, a great idea and keeps the tools nice and neat.</li>
    <li> Crave has done it again with this Blemish and Blackhead remover set. Now, I have personally worked with this brand in the past and still use a couple of the products. When I was sent this product for review I wondered if the quality would measure up. Even though I do not currently have any nasty blemishes to clear off my skin I see the quality they are known for is still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 tools arrived in this beautiful white case (that I somehow wished I could turn into a makeup case for extra usage). The tools were strapped in to their individuals holsters but weren&#x27;t strapped so tightly that they could not be removed with a slight tug. My kit made it to me with no wear and tear and not a scratch on them. (I am really really anal about scratches on my things)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As shown in the video below, each tool has its own distinct middle ridging and specific usage. Even though they look different they are still easily detected as a set.</li>
    <li> These tools are sturdy and get the job done. They come in a nice carrying case. They come sharp so you know that when your ready to use they will get right to the source.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent set, with a size for every troubled spot imaginable. It has a great guide if you are new to using these types of tools but truly is made for a professional. I have been clearing pores for years and this is the biggest and most significant and truly skin refining set I&#x27;ve come across. The range of sizes makes it easy to adjust and work to get all the gunk out.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to wear beauty gloves when using these. It reduces the amount of excess oil being transferred on the skin and they can easily be washed afterward. It also helps when you need to apply extra pressure in certain areas such as the nose - where spots are more prominent yet difficult to hold still. Also, for hard to reach areas like the chin and outer cheeks. Just brace the area with your supporting fingers and hold the tool between your index finger and thumb as usual. Wash the gloves afterward so there is no sebum and oil for your next use. I received a promotional item or price for the intial testing phase and all opinions are my own after personal use.  I would recommend these for anyone in the beauty profession or wanting to learn to do it at home. As stated, there is a handy guide to walk you through the steps in selecting which tool is right for the job.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Arrived quickly.  The tools are stainless steel and worth every penny.  Spend the money to buy a quality product.  There are various sizes and different types of tools to fit your needs.</li>
    <li> After looking at over videos on how to use each tool online, I finally put all these tools to great use! My face has been looking amazing. This product did such an amazing job on all my black heads around my nose. Each tool has double functions which I really love. The tools come in this amazing case to keep all the tolls in, so they don&#x27;t get lost. I&#x27;m so happy with this product - I received this as part of a contest</li>
    <li> High Quality set! I WISH I would have had these back in school! ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD CARRY THIS SET!</li>
    <li> Excellent value and very good quality all in a nifty case.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll use every one of these cool instruments which is probably a good thing. I&#x27;m only used to the loop extractor, and this set comes with two!  That makes it an excellent value for me.&lt;br /&gt;A NOTE OF ADVICE FOR THE OCD FOLKS: Get a 10x mirror and a little 9-LED flashlight.  If you think you got them all, look again!  But don&#x27;t go too crazy, or you&#x27;ll end up with larger pores and a bunch of red spots!  If you dig really hard, you can break the skin and end up with more than a little zit.  Also, it&#x27;s super important to use a good astringent like Clean and Clear after extracting.</li>
    <li> The case&#x27;s zipper is not good at all (we can see from my photo), also after I open it all the tools are not clean. Looks for me they are be used or the material is cheap material. By the way it was made in Pakisitan.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to aay how pleased we are with the quality of the tools and the speed in which we received it. Excellent service! Also, I received a personal email after to offer assistance with product usage and ensure I was satisfied..,,Loved it!</li>
    <li> Great QUALITY and value set.  If you want to buy a nice set of blackhead removers that will last a long, long time you definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this set!</li>
    <li> Years ago, when I was in high school, I had to go to a derma in the Philippines because my pimples were just too many. I remember she had several of these tools and she extracted a lot of pus, whiteheads and blackheads on my nose, chin, forehead and cheeks with these tools. Years after, I owned a blackhead removal tool (similar to the looped one on the Crave Naturals set) for the white head on my nose but I seem to lose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the Crave Naturals Blemish and Blackhead remover, I was amazed at how well made these tools are. I use the several sized loops for different areas on my nose and chin. I haven&#x27;t tried the lancet yet because I am honestly scared to use it on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the rough, no-slip grip of each tool because they help in preventing slips when I use these. The case helps keep them hygienic although I still disinfect the tools before and after I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice to use and make it easier for me to extract my white heads specially on my nose and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free product to try however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.</li>
    <li> Set of excellent quality and price.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my new Crave Naturals Blemish and Blackhead Remover Tool Kit as it is multi purpose. Each tool has double functions which I really like. The tools are also sturdy and non slippery which makes it easier for me to use. * I received this as part of a contest</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new Crave Naturals Blemish and Blackhead Remover Tool Kit. The case is very cute and well made and small wish is great for travel or carry in your purse/bag. The kit comes with instructions and the uses for each tool (you can find videos on Youtube if you are a visual person). Each of every tool is 100% stainless steel and dermatologist approved. It’s a high quality kit, in less than five minutes I removed the entire blackheads from my nose. Also works great removing pimples and whiteheads. For me this is a great and professional way to remove all the pimples, whiteheads and blackheads from your own home. I got this product free for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> I got these things to get the crap out of pores in my nose. I have one blackhead too. Wasn&#x27;t sure how to use them so I look online. Some girl has a video out there and she&#x27;s practically in tears after all was said and done. Grrrr I need to suck it up and just bare the pain but still. I thought you just press down a little and the stuff pops out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even put a hot wet towel on for a couple minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. They are stubborn poors.</li>
    <li> HoaP would like to thank Crave Naturals for providing us product in exchange for an honest review. This review was first seen on Heart of a Philanthropist&#x27;s blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked these easy to use tools! They were easy to use, and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crave Naturals Blemish and Blackhead Remover Tool Kit - Esthetician Skin Care Set for Facial Acne and Blemishes is approved by estheticians, and is easy to use by anyone in their own home. Got zits? Blackheads? Whiteheads? Sick of them being all over your head? Then get this set of tools to help you remove them without damaging your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you &#x27;pop a zit&#x27; you are damaging your skin. It causes scar tissue to develop. Many people who have severe acne end up with poc marks on their face. You know those little craters made by old acne? Also, permanent scarring can take place leaving big red marks on your face where you pinched the skin.&lt;br /&gt;With Crave Naturals Blemish Remover, you don&#x27;t pinch the skin, and you don&#x27;t cause permanent craters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use:&lt;br /&gt;Wash your face with your normal acne treatment (or soap)&lt;br /&gt;Heat a wet towel, and place the hot towel (as hot as you can manage) over your face for about three minutes&lt;br /&gt;When the time is up, place the proper size tool for your blemish over the blemish on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Press down gently but firmly. The blackhead, whitehead will pop out of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;If it does not, do not force it. It may not be ready to be extracted yet.&lt;br /&gt;When you are done removing the blemishes, splash an astringent such as witch hazel on your face to close your pores and to keep out infection. Witch hazel is very mild and does not burn* like other astringents. (*Test the witch hazel on a small spot on your arm or behind your ear to make sure you do not have an allergic reaction. Wait 24 hours after the test prior to using on entire face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HoaP received the Crave Naturals Blemish and Blackhead Remover in exchange for an honest review.

    <li> Item delivery/presentation was not ideal. The tools did not come in a sterilized sealed bag. The bundled case was very dusty inside. Luckily these are stainless steel so you can sterilize the junk out of them. The edges of the tool loops are a bit rough/sharp and could be rounded up a bit to make their use less traumatic to the skin. I have used and seen smoother tools in the past but I just can&#x27;t remember which brand they were.</li>
