      <li>RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE HONEST REVIEW</li>
      <li>After running out of my favorite Argan Oil, I started reading comments on Argan oils here on Amazon and came across this product.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for 4 days now with nothing short of wonderful results and it even rained today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I will probably be seeking to return it and buy the one I really love</li>
      <li>I really love RejuveNaturals Argan Oil -</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is now a favorite shaving oil for us as well.</li>
      <li>It feels good to be able to have such nice silky smooth skin.</li>
      <li>On the up side, delivery was very quick.  </li>
      <li>and they are beautiful, long and strong.</li>
      <li>Almost too light.  </li>
      <li>and I can attest to his face being smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
      <li>THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE I HAD DID.</li>
      <li>Also makes a great cuticle oil, and moisturizer for dry cracked feet.</li>
      <li>It is pure undiluted, certified organic, cruelty free, not tested on animals, pesticide free, GMO free, Origin Morocco, bottled in the USA.</li>
      <li>I used 3 drops on my husbands full beard</li>
      <li>I use about a drop for my face before I apply my makeup and that’s good enough to get my skin hydrated.</li>
      <li>I have never gotten a nick when using argan oil and it leaves my legs super silky.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This products has many great uses and I will continue to repurchase after this bottle is up (which because it’s such a big bottle it will be awhile).</li>
      <li>So I use Argan oil, especially after a shower while the skin is still warm and it absorbs quickly and has no odor.</li>
      <li>Argan oil is great for many things such as dry skin, stretch marks etc...</li>
      <li>You can use it straight or mixed&#x27; in a good cream for feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
      <li>I received this complimentary to review.  </li>
      <li>, I broke out on my face, overall I mix it with my eucerin to manage my eczema, the seller was kind to email a thank you after purchase</li>
      <li>How refreshing to clear out all my orphaned moisturizing creams and lotions that just.</li>
      <li>It is a great bargain when I was used to buying more expensive brands at beauty stores.</li>
      <li>The more that my family and I are outside either at the beach or the pool, they both take a toll on our skin.  </li>
      <li>It can be mixed with almond oil, grapeseed oil and even aloe for a hot oil type treatment and is better than any store bought hot oil treatment</li>
      <li>This Oil is also good for your hair when you get out of the pool and have that dried out chlorine feel to your hair.  </li>
      <li>A big plus - pure (make sure it doesn&#x27;t have additives)</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it comes in a bigger bottle being that my whole family uses it.</li>
      <li>I will be buying it again since it works as good as the more expensive brands and will save me lots of money.</li>
      <li>Your product delivers the same or better results than I expected from more $$$$ brands  </li>
      <li>There is not a heavy, greasy, tacky feel - think &#x27;sheen&#x27; that penetrates quickly.</li>
      <li>I put my hair thru a lot, I use a lot of styling tools and it was getting very dry, but ever since I started using this product it looks healthy, shiny, and it feels super soft,</li>
      <li>I add it to my face moisturizer and lotions for extra hydration and hoping it will reduce the fine lines on my face and under my eyes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Rejuve Naturals Argan Oil is 100% pure organic, fragrance free, and cold pressed which makes it better than many others out there, so always watch for that when you’re buying some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it on my face but don&#x27;t really notice much difference</li>
      <li>Yes it is oily, but it absorbs into your skin or hair so fast.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and well packaged.</li>
      <li>Thanks for bringing your high-end product to the market place at an affordable price.</li>

      <li>I can&#x27;t say as much with this brand). 2)</li>
      <li>During the day I use 3-5 drops occasionally in my palms just to tame the frizzies or fly aways.</li>
      <li>and I’ve had some of them forever that normal lotion couldn’t heal!</li>
      <li>I tried this oil for the first time, WOW!  </li>
      <li>I find myself using way more than I did with the last brand I used (barely a drop with thad brand, but 1 oz.</li>

      <li>I can see myself in a product, and with facts that a potential customer might find useful.</li>
      <li>: I use this in my hair after getting done at the pool, especially if I can’t get to a shower right away to wash the chlorine away.</li>

      <li>My skin is hydrated and it makes my hair very soft.  </li>
      <li>is a nice size, but given how much I use of this particular brand, I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product because it received so many positive reviews, but sadly, I just do not like it.</li>
      <li>It also made his skin soft and clear.</li>

    <li> The bottle is pretty enough to leave sitting on the counter and the oil is not at all greasy and feels very luxurious.  Just few drops rubbed between my palms and then on my heels has made my feet softer and smoother than any other product I have tried.  I could not believe the difference after just a few days of using.  Love it!</li>
    <li> love argan oil for my hair!  This brand is great -- all natural, organic, good value!</li>
    <li> I tried this oil for the first time, WOW!  I wish I had found this years ago. Size is great, price is great! A few drops goes a long way, so it will last for some time. I used 3 drops on my husbands full beard and now it&#x27;s soft to touch, looks much better, and no more prickly kisses! It also made his skin soft and clear. No more beard bumps for him. I use it on my hair and my skin, again just a few drops for my hair and I LOVE the way it feels, looks and handles. My hair is very long, down to my hips and 4 drops is all I use!!  This oil will always be on hand for us. Fast delivery and well packaged. Very pleased with this product!!</li>
    <li> After running out of my favorite Argan Oil, I started reading comments on Argan oils here on Amazon and came across this product.  Of all the oils out there, this one had the highest rated reviews, so I figured I&#x27;d order it.  I must say, I give it two stars for the following:  1) Very light and non-greasy.  Almost too light.  I find myself using way more than I did with the last brand I used (barely a drop with thad brand, but 1 oz. of that brand went a very long way.  I can&#x27;t say as much with this brand). 2) The fragrance / odor.  This brand lacks that &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell, and almost smells overly processed.  I shook the bottle hoping to stir up some natural-smelling fragrance, but alas, nothing.  It just smells slightly like chemicals.  On the up side, delivery was very quick.  I am a Prime member, but received this product overnight.  The other positive is the size; 4 oz. is a nice size, but given how much I use of this particular brand, I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.  I really wanted to like this product because it received so many positive reviews, but sadly, I just do not like it. I will probably be seeking to return it and buy the one I really love (though that one is way more expensive).</li>
    <li> excellent product and everything was delivered in time</li>
    <li> RejuveNaturals Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil is one of the best oils on the market. Packaged in a 4 ounce dark brown glass bottle with a pump top. It is pure undiluted, certified organic, cruelty free, not tested on animals, pesticide free, GMO free, Origin Morocco, bottled in the USA. I have used a lot of different argan oils over the last few years. I have very naturally curly hair, it rest in about 3/4 inch coils air dried and it is almost waist length. It is very coarse and dry, (we have 98% fewer oil glands that people with silky straight hair), my hair also very thick and heavy. I add argan oil to my conditioner&#x27;s, a tablespoon or so to a bottle depending on the size of conditioner bottle. During the day I use 3-5 drops occasionally in my palms just to tame the frizzies or fly aways. Until I found argan oil I had found nothing to work. I have used this for 4 days now with nothing short of wonderful results and it even rained today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for skin care, when I need added moisture, a drop around eyes in awesome. A few drops mixed in a foot cream makes them even better. This oil is excellent quality, it is the right very faint brownish/yellow color and has the right faint nutty smell, almost clear and almost no smell. Yes it is oily, but it absorbs into your skin or hair so fast. It is a great bargain when I was used to buying more expensive brands at beauty stores. It can be mixed with almond oil, grapeseed oil and even aloe for a hot oil type treatment and is better than any store bought hot oil treatment you will ever find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the results I have had the last few days with this brand I will be buying it again since it works as good as the more expensive brands and will save me lots of money. Also makes a great cuticle oil, and moisturizer for dry cracked feet. You can use it straight or mixed&#x27; in a good cream for feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

    <li> Argan oil is great for many things such as dry skin, stretch marks etc... but i have been using it for my hair and it has never looked healthier. I put my hair thru a lot, I use a lot of styling tools and it was getting very dry, but ever since I started using this product it looks healthy, shiny, and it feels super soft,</li>
    <li> High quality oil. Great value</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary to review.  My opinion is 100% my own and am I no way affiliated with this company. I was extremely impressed with the size of this product. It’s about the size of my hand and will end up lasting me forever because I will only use a few drops a day! I love the texture of this argan oil and it works great on my skin, hair, and nails. I use about a drop for my face before I apply my makeup and that’s good enough to get my skin hydrated. It doesn’t make me look oily but it gives me a amazing glow to my skin. I also noticed it’s kind’ve like a primer and made my makeup last longer. I use this on my body as well and have to use just a little bit more. This oil helps heal up some of the dry patches on my skin and I’ve had some of them forever that normal lotion couldn’t heal! I get compliments everywhere I go saying “I’m glowing and my skin looks great”. It feels good to be able to have such nice silky smooth skin. When I put this on my hair I use about one little drop (or two if my hair is really frizzy that day) and rub in the ends of my hair. This helps tame straggly and frizzy hair. When I use this on my nails all I do is put a little bit on each nail and rub in. This gives a natural shiny look to your nails without using a clear coat nail polish. Or helps add back shine to painted nails. This products has many great uses and I will continue to repurchase after this bottle is up (which because it’s such a big bottle it will be awhile). This is a great product!</li>
    <li> works grat on dry skin face and body.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous Moroccan Argan Oil for my face and hair.  Something is different about this one, as it stands out.  After using this product I wondered if the products I used in the past were phoney.  This is the one to try.</li>
    <li> DIDN&#x27;T HAVE THE SAME SMELL THAT THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE I HAD DID.</li>
    <li> The Argan oil is nice.  Odor isn&#x27;t bad but not tropical either.  I use it on my face but don&#x27;t really notice much difference and when I used it in my hair it made it too oily.  However, it does have potential for other uses.  Will have to try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for years, but I never thought about how it would be so awesome on beards! So I smacked some onto my hairy Sasquatch man...... his beard was itching and I had just gotten this sent to me to review and I had an AHA moment and told him to rub some into his beard. It soothed his skin, made him beard soft and shiny and made the skin feel moisturized, Now he would like to take it for over from me on a regular basis :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now a favorite shaving oil for us as well. He said that when he uses this he doesn&#x27;t get ingrown hairs and I can attest to his face being smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. I use this when I shave my legs and I get such a smooth, close shave. it seems to take for longer as well, I guess because I&#x27;m getting such a close shave. I have never gotten a nick when using argan oil and it leaves my legs super silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE HONEST REVIEW</li>
    <li> I use Argan Oil pretty religiously, as I have VERY dry skin. So I started using it for that, but it extends beyond all that now. It’s like a beauty product I MUST have in my arsenal all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rejuve Naturals Argan Oil is 100% pure organic, fragrance free, and cold pressed which makes it better than many others out there, so always watch for that when you’re buying some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair: I use this in my hair after getting done at the pool, especially if I can’t get to a shower right away to wash the chlorine away. My hair is soft and isn’t breaking as often, which is helping it strengthen and lengthen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nails: I use it on my nails several times a week and my nails are honestly longer and stronger than they have been in a long time. This is saying a lot since back in April I did gels and of course my nails were destroyed but a couple of weeks with this Argan Oil and they are beautiful, long and strong. Score!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin: I have extremely dry skin everywhere. My arms, elbows, ankles, heels, face, etc. So I use Argan oil, especially after a shower while the skin is still warm and it absorbs quickly and has no odor. This makes it perfect to put on UNDER your moisturizer or even by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feet: My heels are very dry and rough because I go barefoot a lot! (who needs shoes) but I want them to be soft, so I use the argan oil on them everyday and my heels are definitely softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this Argan Oil to facilitate this review, however all opinions and experiences are 100% honest and my own.</li>
    <li> I really love RejuveNaturals Argan Oil - I started using Argan Oils approx 6 months ago w/other brands that were extremely expensive..............and in very small bottles.  Your product delivers the same or better results than I expected from more $$$$ brands  I use nightly after cleansing my face and my skin has been revived with less wrinkles and has a youthful glow.  I&#x27;m 56 yrs. old.  I constantly get compliments on how youthful my skin looks.  Thanks for bringing your high-end product to the market place at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> One lovely ingredient and that is it. I like that it is in a glass bottle with a quality glass stopper. Also, 4 ounces of an oil that goes a long way is way generous. Living in the southwest desert, this is the best product for everything on my outer body (skin, hair, nails, feet, face!). There is not a heavy, greasy, tacky feel - think &#x27;sheen&#x27; that penetrates quickly. A big plus - pure (make sure it doesn&#x27;t have additives) argan oil is reportedly noncomedogenic (won&#x27;t block your pores). How refreshing to clear out all my orphaned moisturizing creams and lotions that just. don&#x27;t. cut. it. in my environment, and see visible and healthy moisturizing effects! Thank you for a superior product. P.S. I am a typical customer, and not affiliated with the company in any way.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. i use it all over my body. hair, face body, you name it. I add it to my face moisturizer and lotions for extra hydration and hoping it will reduce the fine lines on my face and under my eyes. I will buy again, cant live w/out it. I love the fact that it comes in a bigger bottle being that my whole family uses it. I saw Josie maran has a 6oz bottle. maybe rejuvenaturals will do the same.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I use this nourishing oil on my face, hands, and hair and am very pleased with it.  My skin is hydrated and it makes my hair very soft.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> The more that my family and I are outside either at the beach or the pool, they both take a toll on our skin.  We also like to wear sandals all summer long and that dries out our heal.  The Argan Oil is the easiest and most beneficial for us to use on our skin.  We have members of our family that have eczema and this is the one product that helps heal and hydrate their skin without any side effects.  This product is 100% organic, fragrance free, and cold pressed which makes this product good for your whole body from head to toe.  When one of my children has a scrap or small cut and after it has a scab on it I start putting Argan oil on it to help with the healing process and not have the scares that I grew up with all over my body. This Oil is also good for your hair when you get out of the pool and have that dried out chlorine feel to your hair.  It will make it softer and hydrated after a couple of washes and uses as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> The smell changed after a few weeks, and I kept it in the bathroom where it&#x27;s cool, I broke out on my face, overall I mix it with my eucerin to manage my eczema, the seller was kind to email a thank you after purchase</li>
