      <li>Nice aroma, very good value but was told must buy a good (not plastic) nit comb to get out all the dead lice and nits- either the Terminator or Licemeister .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great product.  Lice had been going around my kids elementary school for a lengthy time.  It seemed we would no sooner get rid of it and then another one of my children would be sent home again with active lice.  I laundered everything, treated the kids with the over the counter chemical filled products, threw out pillows, bagged or tossed stuffed animals. etc, carpet cleaned the rugs.  Finally after wasting a ton of money on over the counter remedies,  I ordered LIceLogic Clear &amp; Free Peppermint Shampoo, the Lemongrass shampoo and conditioner, the nit comb, and repel conditioning spray, and household spray  I followed all of the directions, followed up again in a few days.  Checked my kids daily for a few weeks after treatment. Sprayed the car seats, furniture, etc.  To my great happiness we have been lice free since (about a year).  Yes the products may be a little higher in price up front then over-the counter chemical brands but I just didn&#x27;t want to put anymore chemicals on my kids heads seeping into their little bodies - AND...it&#x27;s safe to re-do sooner then the chemical brands which is so important in truly defeating the infestations.  I&#x27;m so happy I made the change.  I&#x27;m just getting ready to re-order some shampoo, conditioner- Repel products (my kids generally receive a quick spray before they go to school) and I do check my kids a few times a week for any &amp;#34;signs&amp;#34; of lice or nits.  I still spray the car seats and bedding, etc.  So if you are looking for a product to get rid of a current infestation or simply trying to avoid getting -  this is definitely a great line to consider.  (mom note* you must still comb the nits(look like dandruff but won&#x27;t dust off easily, live bugs, etc with the nit comb and possibly re-treat but at least it&#x27;s safe for your kids).</li>
    <li> My grand daughter came to visit. She was 14 and said her mom, her mom&#x27;s friend checked her for lice and said she did not have any. I looked and she was covered with eggs so the lice was there. I ordered bathroom and fluff then shake her hair and huge dying lice would be in my bathtub. This stuff is KILLER! Lice Logic and then combs for 3 hours of long hair to remove eggs, for days she go into my bathroom and fluff, brush and shake out her hair. Their would be huge dying lice in my tub. One more application and she was clean when she went home. She had head lice for over a year! This stuff is KILLER!</li>
    <li> To find a product to treat head lice that is not equal to covering your child with tons of harsh chemicals!!!!!!!!!!  This shampoo is non-toxic, all natural and SMELLS GREAT!</li>
    <li> I ordered the lice treatment shampoo after using the lice treatment/prevention spray in the house. One of the main reasons were all of the 5 star reviews online and the natural ingredients in the product. Where I live it is hard to find these items, and this seemed too good to be true. Well, it was. The shampoo DID NOT WORK. I followed directions, left on for 30 minutes and combed out LIVE lice. I sprayed those lice with the household spray, TWICE, and that did not kill them either after about 60sec! When I dropped a live one in 70% alcohol it died in 7 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to email the company, no email contact..I had to complete a form to get recontacted,  but I liked them on FB on their page to try to reach them that way. I read a few glowing reviews there too by folks who seem to be selling the products. I posted something on FB and that got a reaction fast! Customer Service said I should unlike them and find a better way to complain. I later found an email from them to an address I did not submit to them. They had \\&quot;tracked me down\\&quot; apparently by doing some random online searching. It seemed I was going to get some assistance, but when I laid out the above details that it did not work, I was told to deal with AMAZON for a refund and next time to find a better way to get my complaints across. They (customer service, aka the founder of the company) made NO comments about the fact that the product did not work and gave no guidance to me about why that might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to email her again to ask about what their data showed that showed that this killed lice as they advertize, she had BLOCKED my emails on the same email address they hunted me down on. Very bizarre. I have NEVER dealt with a company that (dys)functions in that manner. Incredibly unprofessional. Do not waste your money. As I reread the other reviews, no one had proof that this killed lice, it does not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best approach: buy the NIT TERMINATOR comb, that is great, and comb out the hair after loading it up with PANTENE conditioner. Wipe on paper towels and you will see the lice and nits. Repeat this every couple of days for about 2 weeks. It is so tedious but it really works. Be sure to clean the comb with alcohol and wash sheets etc. This was the method I used in our last outbreak and it worked. I hoped for a natural short-cut by buying these Lice Logic products but it was a waste of my time and money. Good luck! Should have known better.ter loading it up with PANTENE conditioner.

    <li> it does the work when you have this unfortunate experience</li>
    <li> takes to long to get the mites out, they keep coming back, wife hates the extra work.</li>
    <li> The Lice Logic Head Lice Treatment Peppermint Shampoo is the best head lice treatment on the market today. I have been using this product for two years and can say by far that it is extremely effective and all natural. I love the smell of the peppermint and it works by killing all the bugs and helping loosen the cement glue of the eggs. The company Lice Logic is a wonderful company and all of their products are all \\&quot;Go Green\\&quot; which I highly recommend in our society today to treat lice and also prevent lice. Please buy this product and any other of the Lice Logic products. You will not be dissatisfied but will be glad that you are using all natural products on your children. Good Luck, Jill with all of your new product line. You are the best!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the LiceLogic Head Lice treatment shampoo for my 3 year old daughter when I noticed that she is scratching her head a lot and was worried that she might have got some lice and nits from her cousin who&lt;br /&gt;has those. I wanted something that was safe for a 3 year old and this does seem to be very safe. It did wonders for my daughter&#x27;s scalp. Although I didnt see any&lt;br /&gt;lice falling off or anything like that but still I noticed that once I applied this&lt;br /&gt;product on my daughter&#x27;s hair she scratched less. This smells great as well and&lt;br /&gt;has a peppermint smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> One bottle was enough for our family of four for 3 consecutive treatments over 10 days as described on the bottle, 1 tablespoon each, with a little left over. My youngest was the only one with lice, but you HAVE to treat everyone in the household, so it was nice to have a enough (with a little extra for my daughter with 3&#x27; of hair!). Very nice peppermint scent. Product was received promptly.  Bought this, some of the fairy tales products, and the Terminator lice comb--never had the joy of lice before and didn&#x27;t want them back! The Terminator was definitely worth it--we continue to use it every few weeks as a \\&quot;heads-up\\&quot; check (no pun intended!) and will definitely use LiceLogic again if we need to do the full treatment again (knock wood!).</li>
    <li> Several months ago I ordered the shampoo.  I am a Sunday school teacher and find my kids with head lice quite often.  I didn&#x27;t open the box when it arrived but set it aside.  One of my kids got headlice a few weeks later so we headed to my place to try the new product only to find conditioner in the box instead of the ordered shampoo.  It took a while to get a responce from them through amazon but respond they did and very professionally. Rather than ask for what I orginally ordered I simply reordered deciding I would probably want the conditioner also anyway and I really should have checked the package when it arrived.  No suprise but from coming in contact with my girls I landed my own infestation.  I waged all out war.  Everything in my house was cleaned with very hot water and spent time in a very hot dryer.  The house was sprayed.  And I followed Licelogic directions.  No luck.  Stubborn little guys were still there the next day.  I took the treatment to the next lever and applied it, let it set for an hour.  I did this four times in one  morning.  This product simply didn&#x27;t work on these little guys at all, no matter how extreme I took the treatment.  Very expensive epic fail.</li>
    <li> After two cases in two years, we keep this on hand at all times!  Took care of both cases in record time. My friend who went to the drug store &amp; bought the chemicals called two days later complaining that the little beasts were still there. I convinced her to pay the money for all the lice logic products.  Now her house is lice free thanks to lice logic!</li>
    <li> My son got lice...don&#x27;t know how, but he came home from school scratching his head one day and I freaked out.  So I did some research on the internet about natural lice treatment products and found the Logic Product Group Website.  I bought their kit (which came with the Lice Treatment Shampoo, the preshampoo spray, the home/environment spray and the metal comb).  Never having done this before, I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to do. Their website has a lot of information including a document that you can download that tells you how to do a thorough comb out, which was very, very helpful.  Otherwise I probably would have done it wrong and been unhappy with the results.  What worked for me is that I left the shampoo on my son&#x27;s head for 15-20 mins, then I sprayed the treatment spray, then I combed his hair out with a regular comb to detangle and then did a really good comb out with the lice comb from the kit, using the instructions from the document.  The comb out took about 45 mins to 1 hour. I divided his hair into several small sections and combed out each 4 times (1 from each side of the hair). The lice I was combing out were dead.  No question about it.  And I also got lots of the baby lice  and eggs out too. I made sure to clean the comb with every section I did, in water and vinegar.  Anyway, I did a followup treatment (with the same kind of combout) two days later and he&#x27;s been lice free since (I also did a comb out on my other son, my baby sitter, my husband and myself using the products because we were all potential carriers). I wanted it done right, and I don&#x27;t want it back. I have to say these products were amazing and I didn&#x27;t worry about leaving them on my son for a lengthy time because there are no harmful pesticides in them.  Also the comb that came with the kit was key in the process. It was strong and got right to the eggs.  I followed the directions and also believe that knowing how to do a thorough comb out nipped it in the bud. These products worked forme. I would definitely buy them again and would recommend them to anyone who wants a safer alternative to pesticide options.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for us. We tried it a few times and didn&#x27;t seem to kill everything. Too expensive to not work.</li>
    <li> The Licelogic Lice Treatment Shampoo is a must for all mothers in need of a healthy lice treatment shampoo for their schoolchildren. Not only does this shampoo work, it smells great!  We use it as a weekly preventative treatment for lice, and my four year old is the only one in her kindergarten class not to have had head lice.  Plus, it&#x27;s all-natural and organic. The conditioner is amazing too.</li>
    <li> I will admit, I did not initially know what lice looked like. So by the time I figured out that my 6 yr old daughter (with long hair) had it, we were looking at a pretty good case of head lice. Flustered on a Sunday morning, I ran to Walgreen&#x27;s &amp; Target and purchased the Rite hair solution and household spray. When I read the directions, which stated to keep small kids and animals away I was instantly alert. Monday morning I overnighted ALL of the LiceLogic products (Pre-Spray, Shampoo, &amp; household spray). The Terminator comb was also crucial to the combing process. We sprayed and combed for hours and days to make sure both her and I were lice free. Along with the laundry and house cleaning. LiceLogic works healthy miracles. Thank you LiceLogic for a WONDERFUL product line!!!! I would never use or recommend anything else!</li>
    <li> My mother in law spent over a 100.00 on these products because of the reviews. My daughters school had a head lice problem. We did the treatment on everyone in the house. It didn&#x27;t work. We used the shampoo. Again it didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m very dissappointed my mother in law bought these products so that my children woudn&#x27;t have to use harsh chemicals. Also thinking they worked. I feel these reviews are a bunch of crap. We ended up getting rid of them by buying coconut shampoo. A cheap bottle of suave. Those of you looking into buying this I hope you read my post it will save you time and your pocket. I don&#x27;t review products I buy but felt I had to on this one. Especially when she spent some much on this stuff.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I have serious questions about the claim of 16 treatments per bottle.  The instructions tell you to apply a generous amount to wet hair.  It is an 8 ounce bottle.  There is no way that 1/2 ounce is a generous amount, and it easily took two ounces to completely fill my daughter&#x27;s hair.  That means it is actually a four treatment bottle, and significantly more expensive than originally planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No word yet on its actually success at ridding her of lice and nits before camp next week.  I&#x27;m ordering more because there is no way we&#x27;ll have enough to apply it every two days for ten days.</li>
    <li> After treating my 12-year-old daughter with over-the-counter head lice remedies, a couple of safe \\&quot;home\\&quot; remedies, and doctor-prescribed medications with no success, I desperately searched the internet for some solution to obviously treatment-resistant head lice and found LiceLogic.  I ordered the Shampoo, Spray (for bedding, etc.), and the special comb.  I could not be more pleased with the results.  First of all, I am not putting poisonous toxins on my daughter&#x27;s head and bedding with LiceLogic.  Second, I can treat with LiceLogic products as often as needed without worrying about poisoning her or the environment.  Third, they smell great!  Fourth and most important - THEY WORK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When lathering up my daughter&#x27;s hair with the LiceLogic shampoo, the bugs began dying and falling into the tub.  How&#x27;s that for fast-acting?  The lice absolutely HATE the ingredients in LiceLogic.  I&#x27;ve found that LiceLogic shampoo, when left on the head for 1/2 hour (under a plastic cap), loosens the nit glue and kills approximately 99% of the live bugs.  The 1% that ARE left alive are definitely stunned and easy to kill when combing from the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers easily, and you don&#x27;t have to use much, which is great!  It also rinses out very well, leaving no tacky residue, only clean hair with a slight peppermint smell.  It&#x27;s very, VERY easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using LiceLogic shampoo on the hair does not mean that you don&#x27;t have to still be vigilant in combing and making sure that all the nits are removed from the hair, but the shampoo does loosen the nits from the hair shaft and make it much easier to remove them.  With the Terminator Nit Comb used immediately after using the LiceLogic shampoo, I removed all of the dead bugs, and most of the nits just by combing through my daughter&#x27;s hair.  This made going through her hair later when it was dry MUCH easier and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using over-the-counter head lice remedies for years, it&#x27;s a pleasant change to have my daughter cooperate with me now when I have to treat her for head lice.  She loves the scent of the LiceLogic shampoo, and it doesn&#x27;t burn her head like the OTC products did.  It also doesn&#x27;t irritate the places where the lice have bitten her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray also dries quickly and all of my kids LOVE the scent, so I can use it all over the house without hearing complaints about how \\&quot;it stinks\\&quot;.  I also don&#x27;t have to worry about poisons being sprayed all over my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tried everything you can think of to get rid of head lice and nothing has worked - or you just want to get it right the first time and not use poisons - I would highly recommend using LiceLogic Shampoo and other LiceLogic products.  In fact, the only negative thing I can say about LiceLogic is that their products aren&#x27;t covered under insurance plans.  But that&#x27;s not their fault!now when I have to treat her for head lice.  She loves the scent of the LiceLogic shampoo, and it doesn&#x27;t burn her head like the OTC products did.

The spray also dries quickly and all of my kids LOVE the scent, so I can use it all over the house without hearing complaints about how \\&quot;it stinks\\&quot;.

    <li> very user friendly, and I think that it is a comfortable alternative to other lice shampoos.  You do need to actively work it into the hair for 15 minutes, but that is not hard to do.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a friend&#x27;s child going back to school after spring beak. This is the only product, natural or otherwise, that does the job, and is gentle on the hair! Great company. Amazingly fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I received the shampoo, followed the directions and used almost the entire bottle on my daughter&#x27;s head.  Her hair is just past her shoulders and very thick.  When I have used the RID, NIX, or LiceFree I usually use 2 - 3 bottles to get her whole head done.  Cost wise Lice Logic was as comparable to the previous mentioned products.  Scent wise this product smelled better than the LiceFree black licorice smell.  For anyone who battles lice as I do with my daughter knows that lice eventually become immune (they won&#x27;t die from product).  Unfortunately, this product did not kill ALL of the lice, after following the directions I still combed out live bugs, again this is comparable to the previous products which tend to leave a few bugs alive here and there.  The biggest problem with this product was trying to comb through my daughter&#x27;s hair after using this shampoo, it was nearly impossible to follow the directions to comb through the hair it was just too sticky and wouldn&#x27;t let you run a comb through as directed.  The worst part was my daughter whined about a tingling that was beginning to hurt and I begged her to let me finish it; I even bribed her to tolerate the \\&quot;tingling.\\&quot;  Unfortunately, her toughing it out didn&#x27;t help I still had to torture her as I battled to comb through the tingling mess.  \\&quot;Destroys lice on contact\\&quot; absolutely NOT!  16 treatments per bottle, NOT!  Maybe 2 treatments for my daughter&#x27;s hair length and type and about10 - 12 treatments for the average kids short hair.  I will return to using the comparable competitors when I encounter a head lice problem.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to have found LiceLogic! Growing up with having lice almost every year, I was unfortunate enough to having to endure the over the counter, burning toxic head lice solution, that I find out now (after having children) is and was toxic! I praise LiceLogic for delivering such a gentle non-chemical product, that actually works!!</li>
    <li> I was horrified to find out we had lice. I immediately had everyone in the house use RID even though we only found lice on my daughter. We washed everything - ALL the clothes in my daughters room - even the ones hanging up in the closet, bagged up or washed all her stuffed animals, vacuumed the car, used new sheets and towels daily for 2 weeks. We also used a nit comb on all of us every day. My daughter was on christmas break and we stayed home the entire time so I know we couldn&#x27;t have been re-infected by anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition we tried some &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; that friends told us about figuring what could it hurt. We put olive oil on our hair for 2 hours with a shower cap and then combed it out. Then put apple cider vinegar on our hair which is supposed to loosen the attachment the eggs have on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use RID the instructions are to repeat the process in 7-10 days to kill any missed eggs that may have hatched. I didn&#x27;t want to douse us all with poison again so we tried this product. Followed the directions, left it on for 30 minutes. Used nit comb every day. Then we used this product again in 2 days and found a live louse in my hair after washing it. So even though we used the product twice, it didn&#x27;t kill the lice. We went back to the RID and the lice were gone. Save your money. I hate to use the toxic stuff but this product does not work.</li>
    <li> One treatment on my Daughter and they are gone! Easy to use! It is not greasy like others. I had her use it like shampoo for the week after just to be sure it did not come back.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  The permethrin based products were not working for us here in NY as the lice are actually resistant to it!&lt;br /&gt;Just leave lice logic in long enough to do its thing and comb thoroughly and this product is a home run!  Very, very happy to have found it! Thx!</li>
    <li> Used this twice and didn&#x27;t even phase the lice, in fact it seems they found it rather refreshing and invigorating.  Yeah, no one WANTS to put chemicals on their head or their child&#x27;s heads but unfortunately these little critters were not phased by home remedies or natural treatments (tried the olive oil, conditioner, cetaphil method, lice logic, etc).  What finally seems to be working takes a lot of effort.  I used Nix lice shampoo (and then didn&#x27;t wash my hair for 2 days to let it work)  I bought one of those terminator lice combs (fairy tales brand) and combed through my hair 2 times a day every day (I am on my 7th day of this now), washing everything and vacuuming THEN putting sheets, jacket, pillows, etc in dryer for 40 minutes every night and washing them all every few days (I have done this for the last 7 days).  I think I have finally beat them although I do not want to speak too soon.  Anyway, this Lice Logic stuff was a complete waste of money - natural remedies sound good but haven&#x27;t worked for me.  A good lice comb goes a long way.</li>
    <li> If you read the instructions properly and perform the treatment, post spray, and give everyone the repellant items if they don&#x27;t have them; you have no problems from lice after 2 weeks. 3-4weeks, if you decide to skip steps/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lice Logice cleared 5 kids and prevented 4 adults from getting any.</li>
    <li> This item is awful. I used It in my daughters hair as per the instructions and she still got lice with casual contact. Bought a different product for half the money that worked much better, it killed and repelled to prevent further infestation and that product was also non toxic. I purchased this expensive item based on ratings.... Big mistake on my part. Do your research and look at other products before buying.</li>
    <li> This was a lifesaver. I&#x27;d tried 7 or 8 other products - nontoxic and finally those with pesticides due to my frustration. I also bought a Nit Free Terminator Lice Comb along with this product after reading (too late) that the plastic combs that come with most products are useless. The metal comb and the shampoo did wonders immediately, and we never had problems again .. even after there was a reinfestation at the school.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
    <li> Not enthused with this product, I ususally buy these products for the extra conditioning values but this was just like regular shampoo with a hint of mint.</li>
    <li> Great product, very happy with results, highly recommend. Great solution for multiple treatments when you&#x27;re trying to avoid chemicals around your kids.</li>
    <li> It did not work! I have done multiple treatments on my child&#x27;s hair, I see no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I find a fine tooth comb much more effective than this very expensive lice treatment shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews and was scared to buy this and try it. I followed the directions and it worked like a charm. I also followed up with the lice preventative products and we haven&#x27;t had an issue since. Well worth it! I had used almost every over the counter product and even had the dr call us in a prescription. Nothing worked for us but this product!</li>
    <li> I ordered the lice shampoo and spray after discovering lice on my son. We used the product, but kept finding lice after several treatments. I contacted the company for help and immediately received an answer to my email with a toll free number to call. I called and was able to speak with the company founder and get GREAT information as to what was happening. It was determined my son was getting re-infested from somewhere since I knew the shampoo and spray were working. When he was lice free for over 2 weeks and then began finding lice again, we were able to narrow down the \\&quot;infester\\&quot;, a close friend. Now we have to figure out a way to tell the friend they may be the source for lice!!! This product works great and I will order again if needed. I received the best customer service from this company, which is becoming rare these days. I highly recommend this company and the products they sell!</li>
    <li> If you want a safer product: buy REAL mayonnaise like Helman&#x27;s. Leave it on for an hour. Comb through  each layer like you were putting in cornrows or french braiding EVERY 1/16 cm section. Then go through it the same way again, making sure to rinse the comb with running hot water (do not stick the comb back into the sink where you just placed their dead relatives!). Cover with 2 plastic grocery bags and tie itt in a knot in the front (not with the lice - invested hair tie). Means hole get a plastic sheet cover and pillow covers and Don them on each bed. Spray all the furniture and do no let anyone sit on anything but the tile or laminated floor for that week. Place all toys on the deep clean sanitize cycle. Along with pillows, cases, bedsheeets, hats, gloves, scarfs(ANYTHING cloth or made of fabric),  necklaces,  etc. Again do this process once and repeat in 7 days. We usually repeat every 3 days for two weeks, but we don&#x27;t have any reoccurrences either.</li>
    <li> We followed the Licelogic instructions and within days all three members of the family were completely free of lice and nits, as confirmed by our local lice removal expert.  The shampoo has a great scent and is great for the scalp. We would use it even without lice.</li>
    <li> This shampoo worked for myself and my daughter. Neither if us felt any irritation, but individuals could have different experiences.  Think about how hard you scratched your head or dragged the comb against your scalp.  If you were harsh, many products could cause a reaction.  If you have \\&quot;a head full,\\&quot; you can even use this shampoo for three days in a row. (We tried one of those commercial products. If you missed anything in the comb out, you are helpless for ten days.) I would do the thirty minute shampoo and use a conditioner for the comb out.  (The comb is what gets the eggs and nits out, so you NEED a good comb!)  If you aren&#x27;t sure how do the comb out, go to [...] and watch the video.   This shampoo was reformulated in 2012, so I cannot speak about earlier reviews. But you must remember:  ---eggs take two weeks to hatch.  Shampoo and comb out again!  ---everyone in the house, school, and work that you come in contact with should be checked.  ---pillows, hats, scarves, coats, brushes, combs, hair ties, etc. need to be treated until you are clear.  (Heat, alcohol, boiling water, etc.)</li>
    <li> With two girls in elementary school, we&#x27;ve tried just about every lice shampoo on the market.  This is probably the only one that works, and is safe for kids.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works. My daughter&#x27;s head was covered with lice before she knew what they were. This product worked wonderfully. We bought the shampoo, the hair spray and the upholstery spray. We didn&#x27;t even use all of it before the lice were gone. I have used the upholstery spray for ants and earwigs outside....dead on contact! This stuff really works. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the results of treatment with this product. All the lice and ticks are gone, and done by natural means. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> If this product didn&#x27;t work for you, it is probably because your environment was not treated.  After trying chemical treatments and Fairy Tails (which is useless) this is the ONLY product that worked on my 3 girls.  But no one product is a solution.  As long as lice remains in your child&#x27;s environment, it remains a constant battle for every parent.</li>
    <li> This product was used by and recommended by a lice specialist in Dobbs Ferry and it took care of our lice problem! The shampoo was gentle to our hair and pleasant smelling. Because it was being used by a professional, I had high confidence its safety and performance. We still use it once a week as a preventative and we are happily lice free!</li>
    <li> Product does not kill live live at all !!!!!!</li>
    <li> When my son came home from school with lice I was in a panic.  I called a friend and she recommended LiceLogic shampoo and treatment products.  Luckily she had some extra shampoo and conditioner on hand that I could use.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it smelled and how effective it was on treating the lice.  Those daily shampoos and comb outs can be a drag with kids but once my son smelled the peppermint scent he didn&#x27;t fight me on our nightly ritual.  If you haven&#x27;t tried LiceLogic you should.  It&#x27;s safe not only on your children but also the environment.  With so many products on the market (and we&#x27;ve tried many with three young kids) this is by far the best we have found!    I also recommend the daily spray as way to keep lice from getting on your kids when their is a breakout in the school.  A must buy for kids headed off to camp this summer.</li>
    <li> I used this in combination with the Calaphan lotion method. You can google it to see all about it. I loved this shampoo because it smells great and is non toxic. I was able to use it several times without fear of hurting my child. We left it in our hair over night for added protection and it came out right away and left our hair soft and clean. Now when my child has an over night visit or,girl scout trip we whip this out and treat her hair ! No worries of harmful chemicals and neuro toxins.</li>
    <li> This product worked better than any of the harsh chemicals I used throughout 25 years of raising my five children (and having my three grandchildren visit). The higher price is WELL worth it, because it only required one treatment and the pleasant smell (minus toxic chemicals) is phenomenal. Thank you so very much for an effective, safe and pleasant-smelling solution to a common childhood problem!</li>
    <li> What attracted me to this shampoo and the other Licelogic products is that they use essential oils, not harsh chemicals.  The products smell great, work great and can be used regularly to serve as a preventative.  I feel confident sending my child to school knowing that aside from shaving his head, he is as protected as I can get him.  I do feel that the shampoo alone is not enough.  I strongly suggest following up with the conditioner and Licelogic comb. The shampoo may kill / stun the little buggers but it doesn&#x27;t get all the \\&quot;debris\\&quot; out of the hair.  The comb is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.  You&#x27;ll be surprised at what comes out of your childs&#x27; hair the first time you use it!  I use the Peppermint Shampoo and Lavender condition at least once a week and do a comb out for my son and myself just to stay ahead of the game.  I really love this company, their customer services and their products!  I just ordered their tick and flea products for my dog so I&#x27;ll be ready come this Spring!</li>
    <li> Enzymes really are the magic bullet against head lice. Combing out all the nits is where dealing with head lice gets difficult. Enzyme products dissolve the nit glue, which makes removing nits ten times easier. Other treatments don&#x27;t touch the nit glue ... and lice can&#x27;t develop resistance to their own enzymes. Those two reasons are why enzymes are so effective.     But until recently it was hard to find enzyme treatments for head lice. Years ago, I was lucky to find a small health food store within driving distance which carried enzyme shampoo. I wanted to order more to keep on hand just in case, and found that I had to hunt down the manufacturer&#x27;s website and order from there (without free shipping).     So I&#x27;m really glad that LL has brought their enzyme shampoo to a major retailer like Amazon. I haven&#x27;t used their pretreatment spray, but it looks like a good addition which would make the enzyme treatment work even more quickly.     There&#x27;s also a mousse-like enzyme shampoo which is becoming more widely distributed. It may work just as well - I&#x27;ve never tried that kind. But it&#x27;s much more expensive. It only has two treatments in a bottle (about seven dollars per treatment). The LiceLogic shampoo has 16 treatments in a bottle (slightly over two dollars per treatment). It only takes a couple of treatments to get rid of the lice, so you can keep the rest on hand in case your family encounters head lice again.</li>
    <li> My kids brought home lice and I already had the Rid stuff in the house because of all the scares at school so we did that initial treatment but then I found out about this product. It&#x27;s safe to use and doesn&#x27;t have all the pesticides in it so we&#x27;ve been using this a lot and letting it sit for 20 minutes in their hair while they are in the tub. I even use it too and just wrap my hair in a towel. Then we blow dry and and use tea tree oil and other conditioners that deter lice. We haven&#x27;t had any issues for weeks but I&#x27;m nervous about an reoccurrence which many folks talk about, I&#x27;m keeping this shampoo on hand and feel that it has worked. Also, it&#x27;s the only one that I&#x27;ve found that says it kills the knits too. I know it&#x27;s a tad pricey but it&#x27;s worth it in my book. I also bought the knit spray and the home spray. I&#x27;m going be ordering more and telling everyone about this.</li>
    <li> Simply said, NO it did not work!</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a professional lice salon that sells it in the area. I was in a panic and called them for advice after discovering my son and daughters all had robust cases of lice. I cannot believe it went undetected for so long (by me) so I needed something that would work.No time to waste. This shampoo was 100% for all 3 of the kids, worked completely, and loving it is natural. We still have a quarter of a bottle left over just in case lice invades us again. Nice aroma, very good value but was told must buy a good (not plastic) nit comb to get out all the dead lice and nits- either the Terminator or Licemeister . Not a lot of direction on the label so go to the company web site for the details on how to use. Definitely a serious lice shampoo that works the way it should. Extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This will do nothing to kill lice. You&#x27;d be better off with just a comb.</li>
    <li> The harsh chemicals in most lice treatments should only be used twice over your lifetime.  That gives you an idea of how toxic they are.  This treatment, used with very careful picking of nits, was 100% effective in our case, did not cause the asthmatic response my child had to the RID treatment, and was much more pleasant overall.  I totally endorse it but emphasize that you still must do the comb out and followup treatment.</li>
    <li> Product appears to work well, since I started using it I haven&#x27;t combed out a single live louse. Feels good on the head, nice and tingly and refreshing. Not sure it has 16 uses in the bottle but still its worth the money, miles above any of the nasty pesticide laden stuff you would buy at a pharmacy. Would buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> We went to a lice expert in Dobbs Ferry and used this product at her suggestion.  It was easy to use and did the trick after a few comb outs.  It had a pleasant smell and was not as harsh as some of the other products recommended on the market.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was very expensive, but I was desperate - which unfortunately is probably how many people feel at the point they purchase lice treatment products.  We did let it stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair for the prescribed amount of time, and it did smell nice. Not sure if it was any more effective than the other lice shampoos, but since it was non-toxic, at least I felt better about it.  But paired with the Terminator nit - comb, I was able to remove A LOT of nits and lice.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t agree with those 2 customers who were not happy with the results. I guess they didn&#x27;t have the patience to follow the instructions. I consider myself a veteran in the war against head lice. I have 3 girls, all with very long and light hair which unfortunately attracts head lice. I tried most of the products  on the market with no luck. When I finally found these non-toxic good scented super-effective products I felt so relieved and grateful!!. They do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do, exterminate and prevent lice. I really recommend them to anyone who need to treat lice No other product can be compared to LiceLogic! Just remember to follow the instructions : )</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work. The good reviews look like fakes to me. Go to your pharmacists and get a recommendation. Many types of lice are resistant to pesticides now. The makers of LiceLogic are taking advantage of this.</li>
    <li> This product worked like a charm; we used it nightly for a week, and it killed all the lice and nits. It also smells great! We highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not a trace of lice in our home since the first time my daughter came home from school with it over a year ago.  Great product!</li>
    <li> We have been very happy with the product.  We have used it post typical over the counter lice treatments since after the regular RID and NIX treatment we were still picking out LIVE lice - so much for that!  Lice Logic worked well. I have three girls with different hair types.  Long, straight and very thick, medium straight but very fine, and long curly and fine.  It has worked well in all their hair types without any major tangles.  The smell is pleasant and they all like it.  We haven&#x27;t had a lice reoccurrence and I think the price is good.  We buy mostly non toxic and naturally minded health and beauty products and I felt the price was fair for the amount of product. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! My little person has extremly dry skin and dandruff. I was devistated when she brought home head lice from kindergarten. I tried your clear and free shampoo and it not only got rid of the lice but conditioned her scalp! I now use it once a week to keep her from getting dry ,itchy, flakey scalp. Works FANTASTIC! I highly recomend keeping one on hand if you have school age children.</li>
    <li> When my child finally got the dreaded lice infestation that had been making the rounds at school, I hesitated to treat her with an over the counter pesticide since we try to use only natural body care products.  Instead I found this all natural lice shampoo.  It was effective in killing all lice and nits and we have not had a recurrence unlike many families we know who chose the drug store option. This lice problem persisted for months at the school being passed between the students but we only had to treat the one time.  After the initial lice shampoo, I used LiceLogic Hair Nit Spray and Household Spray regularly on my child&#x27;s hair, backpack, bike helmet, etc. as a preventative and it worked wonderfully.  Why use toxic chemicals on your family when there is a natural, safe, and effective alternative?</li>
    <li> Well, if I am paying 34 bucks for shampoo for lice, I would like to receive it in a timely manner.  Still waiting 10 days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Terminator lice comb arrived shortly after I ordered it....which is what you want for a lice product.  That, and good old fashioned Lice shampoo from the drugstore has eradicated the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great site that talked me down off the ledge when my daughter came home from a sleepover with lice was the Nice Lice Lady&#x27;s blog.  Practical and calming advice.</li>
    <li> My daughter had lice and we went to the lice expert in Dobbs Ferry.  I went home and used the product just as I was told and it worked great .  She was lice free after the the first comb out. I did three more after that to make absolutely sure and she was fine . She did not mind the smell and her hair did not dry out as I expected .  I would recommend this product for anyone who comes across this problem.</li>
    <li> My entire family went to the lice specialist in Dobbs Ferry and purchased all of these products from her after she used them on us. They worked great, smelled good and killed the lice! We loved that they were all natural and not too harsh. I would buy them again if the need arose.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone who is battling headlice.  Five months ago I got headlice from my neices.  I used every product under the sun.  I even used organic products such as pure tea tree oil with no success. One day my family and I came a cross Lice Logic.  I decided to give it try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I suffered for 5 whole months with headlice. I even lost half of my hair due to the continuous use of the nit comb.  No product on the market can compare to Clear Lice. Its the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Lice Logic</li>
    <li> I ordered Lice Logic after trying two products from my local pharmacy that did not work. I was very close to taking my child to one of those expensive salons that removes the lice for you. Not only did Lice Logic Shampoo kill the lice, but the nits no longer stuck to the hairs and were much easier to remove. I ended up using it twice on my child just to be sure everything was gone. I would highly recommend this product over anything else. I&#x27;m guessing the bad reviews have come from not following the exact instructions. I am keeping a bottle on hand in case we have a future problem and I am also using the Lice Logic Repel Conditioning hair spray every morning on my child.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much time unfortunately but we just wanted to say that we LOVE your products completely and devotedly. The first ones we bought were actually from you here in your apartment in downtown NYC because we had an emergency. The second was bought on amazon because thanks to your caring advice and help for us the first time, we knew what to do and just got the products. Best lice elimination and prevention products EVER. You have done an amazing job. Now only if the CDC would see that these natural products actually work better AND don&#x27;t harm our kids. All the best, Brook Bartlett, Brooklyn, NY</li>
    <li> After using the commercial shampoos on my daughter twice and&lt;br /&gt;still having lice I didn&#x27;t want to continue using the chemicals. And the&lt;br /&gt;fact that I had to keep using them made me question how effective they were&lt;br /&gt;anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally went onto Amazon and got a really good nit comb and the LiceLogic&lt;br /&gt;shampoo. I will continue to use those for any future outbreaks. I like that&lt;br /&gt;there are no harmful chemicals (and it smells that way), it was easy to&lt;br /&gt;use. The way it foams makes it less likely to get in the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it took us a couple of rounds of treating before we found your shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Lice are hard to get rid of but now we&#x27;ll make sure we have enough LiceLogic shampoo on hand, just in case.</li>
    <li> I applied the shampoo to the entire family and followed the combing directions carefully on the companies website. I  was able to get rid of all the lice on all kids with one treatment and thorough lice combing.&lt;br /&gt;This is the most effective product I have ever tried for lice treatment and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised as it delivered on all fronts. I did accidentally leave a few nits in the hair but they did not develop further or hatch so it truly did kill the nits too. I would buy this product again if lice happens to my family again. The scent was also surprisingly pleasant which is a bonus as the children did not complain about this product.</li>
    <li> Finally we have found what we needed to fix this lice outbreak. What a disaster having to try so many products just to find one that actually does what it claims. Very good lice shampoo, very relieved all lice are gone, and am one happy parent now. Kids are no longer scratching their heads raw and I am no longer scratching mine trying to figure out a plan to get rid of this bug like plague. What an experience and so glad it is finally over. Am going to tell all my friends too so they can keep their kids lice free so mine do not pick it up again. Thanks lice logic for ending this nightmare for us.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best lice shampoo I have ever used. With 3 kids we have tried them all, natural and otherwise, but this stuff really worked well for my entire family. I found it to be a nice value as there are really 16 treatments in the bottle which I was skeptical about until I started using it. The shampoo is super concentrated (not thick though) and we still have some left over for the next time. It has been several weeks and we are still in the clear so hopefully there will never be a next time, but if it happens I will buy this shampoo again.&lt;br /&gt;I have read the other reviews on this product and after using it I simply cannot understand how anyone can say this product is bad or does not work. My gut feeling is that they did not use it properly or have other motives.</li>
    <li> Took care of the lice and the lice eggs. Very happy customer. Would buy again if needed. Hope I do not need to however.</li>
    <li> my daughter came home from school and her and three of her friends had lice.  i freaked out and called my friends and they told me to get Nix.  i called the nurse and she said to stay away from the pesticide products and recommended one that she said really worked called licelogic.  i called the company and they told me what to do and i ordered it. and it worked!  meantime, my daughters friends at school still had lice two days later.  one of the mothers came over and borrowed the bottle i bought and she used it and it worked too. i had to comb through her hair with a metal nit comb to remove all the dead lice and nits. also, it smells great and my daughter loved it too. good value at 16 treatments per bottle which does seem about right. my daughter has shoulder length hair and so does her friend. would buy again.</li>
    <li> The first time my daughter brought lice home from school, I consulted the pharmacist, used an over-the-counter product, and the cheap plastic nit comb that came with it.  Followed the directions exactly, hated the smell and hated using a toxic product, and then spent 4 hours thoroughly combing out the nits and many live lice.  The next day there were still some live bugs in her hair (in spite of hours and hours of vacuuming carpet and upholstery and washing all bedding in hot water, and bagging up all stuffed animals).  Got a heavy- duty prescription from the pediatrician, which did the job, but I felt horrible using it on her.  The same boy in her 4th grade class brought lice to school again a few months later to the point where they were falling out of his head onto his desk, and girls were shreiking (shave that boy&#x27;s head, mama!).This time I had Licelogic Clear and Free shampoo on hand (just in case!). I loved it!  This time the nits were a lot easier to remove, the smell of the shampoo was good, and it left my daughter&#x27;s hair and scalp in really good condition - clean and silky, without being oily. It works!  There is enough left in the bottle for more treatments, but my husband wants me to buy 3 bottles ahead, just to have on hand. Parents need to use a really good nit comb (available on Amazon.com), follow directions exactly, and follow all the recommendations on the Internet concerning ridding them from the household (and please check the kids&#x27; scalps daily for 2 weeks, then weekly, so you don&#x27;t spread them to other kids).  I don&#x27;t wish this nightmare on anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff really worked nothing you can buy over the counter can compare worth every cent paid Thank you best product</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product. I pride myself on researching all products out there to find the safest, natural product for my children.  After much research and discussion with the owner of this company (Yes, I called on a Saturday, and the OWNER picked up the phone and spent a ton of time with me), I chose this product after my children were exposed to lice repeatedly.  I also found that one of my children had a few live bugs in her hair after the exposure.  Of course, I freaked, but this product not only smelled good, it did the trick!  I followed directions perfectly, and at the end, I found the bugs stunned, perhaps even dead.  They combed right out of the hair, not moving!&lt;br /&gt;The owner, after our conversation, actually emailed me lab results of this product.  It was extremely informative and gave me the ease I needed when I saw how effective it was in laboratory tests.  I highly recommend calling customer service if you have questions. You wont&#x27; be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The current LOGIC products I use are :  Lice treatment shampoo, preventative lavendar shampoo, and conditioning spray.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Lice Logic, for producing a product that not only works, but is safe for our children!  I highly recommend, and I am a tough critic!</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;My car and apartment became infested with a combination of body lice, head lice, dog fleas as well as punkies or marsh flies from a canal  and the northwest branch of the Anacostia river which is one block from me.  Your LiceLogic Clear and Free Shampoo and LiceLogic Head Lice Treatment Shampoo has been a lifesaver for me because I can use it everyday. It is very effective. Thank You for making this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;B. Yaman</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a lice removal specialist in my area, and it seemed to work well as part of a comprehensive treatment for an unexpected lice problem resulting from an outbreak in my son&#x27;s school. The combination of professional comb-outs, Lice Logic shampoo and home comb-outs seems to have done the trick (I hope :)  And I really appreciate the natural ingredients and lack of harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> We had 2 children bring lice home recently and went into an all out war trying to get rid of them.  Finally we brought in a professional lice removal service who showed us how to do a proper comb out (using the Terminator comb) and an enzyme type product, similar to this, to loosen the nit glue.  That combing technique made all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I agree that this product definitely serves a purpose - because the chemical solutions sold in drugstores only kill the live critters - it is only as efficacious as your combing process.  The combing has to be kept up, by the way, for multiple weeks.</li>
    <li> I am not one to write reviews but i wanted to spread my thoughts on this product.  After a 3 week long battle of head lice, I turned to this product.  It was my saving grace.  I did not worry about dumping chemicals on my kiddos heads intially.  I was freaked out and thought kill this awlful thing called head lice.  I want it over with, get rid of it.  It wasn&#x27;t that simple.  I used a chemical treatment three times, one week apart each.  I was not doing it again.  It worked but was not getting rid of the problem.  I then purchased the peppermint lice killing shampoo.  The shampoo was great, smelled great and we could use it daily to attack the problem.  But the customer service was even better.  I recieved an email and a phone call when I  had questions about the product.  I needed that extra support.  Frankly the lice epidemic had about sent me over the edge.  I am now on the prevenitive treatment, shampoos and spray.  The products might be a little pricey but compared to what I have spent to get rid of lice, I will gladly pay it. Thank you licelogic!</li>
    <li> This product worked like a dream, it killed all the nits and lice. I did have to comb them out or else they would have remained in the hair, which let&#x27;s face it would be very unsightly. Very great full to the company for making this safe, pleasant smelling lice shampoo .......THAT WORKED. Would purchase again.... but hope will never have too because who wants to battle lice??</li>
    <li> I gave it a 5 star rating because it really works! Great to use a natural product and no toxins.</li>
    <li> My son was sent home with lice a few weeks back and we were treated by the Lice Expert of Dobbs Ferry.  In addtion to him using the shampoo, I had a comb out with it and shampooed the rest of the family.  I worked great.  The shampoo didn&#x27;t bother any member of my household with strong odors or addtional reactions, it didn&#x27;t dry out any of our hair which I was concerned about making our scalps itchy.  Especially for my son who was the person who had the lice in the first place and had to be shampooed daily.  It was a simple process and would definitely suggest it to others that experience the nightmare of head lice.</li>
    <li> i use this every night, put a shower cap over my daughters head and let it sink in for an hour, then i rinse it out and comb through her hair.</li>
    <li> Strong enough to do the job.  It is hard to find something natural that works as well as this shampoo.</li>
    <li> #1 I recommend soaking the head in original yellow Listerine for two hours to kill the bugs dead. THEN USE THE SHAMPOO EVERY NIGHT FOR A WEEK. When you first put the shampoo in, it feels like it&#x27;s going to make your hair dry. But, when you&#x27;re done, put in a strong smelling (lice hate smells) leave-in conditioner and your hair will be smooth. My daughter and I used this shampoo for an entire week. WE FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS and did comb outs. You&#x27;re not getting rid of the lice if you don&#x27;t comb out those nits. We also washed and/or dryed every piece of clothing, pillow, blanket or sheet in all of out hangout areas in the house. THIS SHAMPOO IS AWESOME BECAUSE IT WORKS. THOSE NITS ARE OUT. NOT A BUG SINCE THE FIRST DAY. IT&#x27;S ALSO NOT TOXIC LIKE RID AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF. THE ALCOHOL IN LISTERINE KILLED THEM, BUT I DID NOT WANT TO SMELL LIKE LISTERINE ALL WEEK. The shampoo SMELLS GOOD. It made out hair very shiny. I went to get my hair cut and colored yesterday and the hairdresser did not notice I had lice or that I used lice shampoo. In fact, she said that my hair looked healthy!!!</li>
    <li> weve used this on our daughter after she came home from school with lice. we complained to the school but all they can do is check the prob. it not up to them to resolve it.i bought this and had to use it multiple times to really eradicate the lice but it works.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I would never treat a Lice outbreak on my own...been there, done that! I leave that to the professionals.  I bought the Lice Logice Shampoo to use for after-treatment and preventative care. My daughter uses it like regular shampoo once every ten days or so. It&#x27;s easy to use and smells great. Oh, and no more lice!!</li>
    <li> Was fine for first couple of days and then my skin started to burn and peel. Didn&#x27;t even work at all.</li>
    <li> Although this product smelled much better than other products I have used, it did not work for the intended purpose.  This was frustrating considering the cost of the product.</li>
    <li> My daughter came home from school and we saw the dreaded little bugs in her hair. I quickly turned to the computer for research and alternatives to the chemical treatments when I came across LiceLogic. This shampoo may seem expensive but the amount of treatments are far more than with other treatments and this product is safe to use again and again. Some of the well known treatments include only two treatments for around the same price and cannot be used repeatedly. We were skeptical it would work but figured we&#x27;d give it a try. The shampoo must remain in the hair for up to 30 minutes and the nits and lice DO still need to be picked/combed out. Missing even one can lead to reinfestation and the nightmare begins all over again. This shampoo smells great, is not harsh, and works! The instructions state to work into the hair and scalp for 15 minutes and then leave the product in for another 15 minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ No Pesticides&lt;br /&gt;+ Numerous Treatments Per Bottle&lt;br /&gt;+ Smells Great&lt;br /&gt;+ Does Not Burn Scalp&lt;br /&gt;+ Safe For Daily Use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Having to leave the product in so long can be time consuming but not truely a downfall because it works! 5 Stars!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend looking for an alternative to the harsh chemical pesticides used for the treatment of lice/nits. The infestations can be challenging to overcome but with patience, work, and the right tools it can be done!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from from the owner of an All Natural Lice Removal service I used for my daughter. She applied this product and thoroughly combed through all the lice/nits and guaranteed this product to work. Unfortunately, it did not work. I diligently followed the home care routine &amp; sanitized my home. Yet on day 3 I was still combing out nits and live lice. The lice I was removing were young and newly hatched, yet this product claims to render the nits unviable. This was not the case for me. I was instructed to leave the shampoo on my daughters head for an hour before rinsing, after an hour passed as I began to rinse her hair, there was a live louse crawling on my daughters head. I immediately called the All Natural Lice Owner and she offered to have me come back for free. I finally went to Target, purchased rid and it irradicated  them. I wanted to go the natural route but sometimes it is simply not effective. I also kept hearing that \\&quot;lice are resistant to over the counter lice removal drugs\\&quot; but this was NOT the case for us. If this happens again I would buy definitely skip this product and use RID.</li>
    <li> All three of our girls had various levels of head lice.  We used both the treatment and the prevention products.  I felt much better using these products versus the harsh chemical-based ones at the local CVS.  Properly used they did exactly what we expected.  They killed live lice and helped us to interrupt their life cycle which is really the key.</li>
    <li> Excellent product worked great and the ingredients were as gentle on the children as promised! I shared it with the other children at the school who needed it.  Definitely a HUGE difference from the RID products that don&#x27;t work!!!</li>
    <li> We started using your product many years ago when my older daughter first got lice. Being our first experience with it, we used over the counter products. Trying to find out more information I put one of the dead bugs in a zip loc bag to examine it and compare it to the pics online. Ten minutes into the process the thing started walking around again. I was stunned. These over the counter pesticide products were supposed to work. I thought this was my only solution. I started doing more research and I found your product online. I ordered it and repeated the ziploc bag test. The thing stayed dead and the lice were finally gone. I vowed I would never use anything else every again. My younger daughter is very susceptible to lice and seems to get it by just saying the word lice. Every instance we have used your product and have had nothing but peace of mind with it. I love it and have recommended to any and everyone who asks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julie</li>
    <li> I bought this product because we discovered lice on my poor niece during a vacation, so we all purchased products to try and counteract any of us getting lice as well.  The shampoo was great!  It smells nice and had no adverse effects.  I did two treatments, and I didn&#x27;t get any lice.  I also still have a good bit of shampoo left in case of future need.</li>
