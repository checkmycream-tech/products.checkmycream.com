      <li>I love this foundation it goes on great and has great coverage.</li>
      <li>I heard good things about this foundation from beauty gurus on YouTube</li>
      <li>I use a makeup brush to blend it in and It covers nicely and feels good on my skin.  </li>
      <li>- I am usually a light beige in most makeups; but, I went with the Vanilla color which is one shade lighter and it was a perfect match.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>But boy does it work amazingly.</li>
      <li>A nice alternative when I don&#x27;t feel like using BB cream.</li>
      <li>This is the absolute BEST foundation!  </li>
      <li>I liked the consistency and the wear.</li>
      <li>So that was really nice</li>
      <li>(Also, the vanilla is a color match to the Ivory to Fair #10 in the Neutrogena healthy skin enhancer - if that</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase :)</li>
      <li>I reached out to this seller to ask a quick question &amp; they are very kind &amp; prompt.</li>
      <li>Love this as much or more than my favorite luxury brand!</li>
      <li>It has a light fruity smell which is nice.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully  I&#x27;m able to use this vendor again as the shade (vanilla)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with the Healthy Mix Foundation.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a lovely foundation</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most foundations, so I was a bit worried taking a chance on this one.</li>
      <li>Such a great product!</li>
      <li>but next time i&amp;#34;ll purchase a shade darker for a perfect match.</li>
      <li>love this makeup.  </li>
      <li>and i love the glow it gives to my skin.</li>
      <li>The coverage could have been better, but it was still buildable.</li>
      <li>I really love this foundation..</li>
      <li>Love the color Vanille for light skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the smooth application</li>
      <li>Delivered very quickly.</li>
      <li>easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It goes on easy and lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>Has really benefited my skin and makes a very smooth finish that looks and stays put!  </li>
      <li>but I mix it with a slightly darker foundation that I already have and its perfect.</li>
      <li>Overall, great foundation..</li>
      <li>Fabulous coverage.</li>
      <li>light coverage.</li>
      <li>However I ordered 1 shade too light</li>
      <li>goes on smoothly and lasts for the 8 hour work day.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, and has not made me break out at all.</li>
      <li>but this applied fairly smoothly except on my forehead.  </li>
      <li>You would not want to buy this product if you want medium to significant coverage.</li>
      <li>in combination with my wet Real Techniques beauty sponge this foundation goes on perfectly.</li>
      <li>I get a medium to full coverage with this which I wanted.  </li>
      <li>It is good value for money as similar foundations sell for multiples of the price of this foundation.</li>
      <li>This shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>I have been very interested in trying this foundation for awhile now.</li>
      <li>I have the powder from this company also and love all the products thus far!</li>
      <li>Leave it to me to fall in love with a foundation you can only get easily in Europe.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I chose the right color.</li>
      <li>But still worth the wait.</li>
      <li>This is okay tho since I don&#x27;t plan on wearing this product on my face anywhere near 16 hours.</li>
      <li>Two thin coats (drying in between) gives me a flawless face.</li>
      <li>It feels fresh and light like a tinted moisturizer but the coverage is decent.</li>
      <li>This was recommended by Lisa Eldridge, make-up artist, as a good, natural, light to medium-coverage (build-able) for skin tending toward dry.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to blend, leaves a nice finish and is neither dried out nor dewy.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great for everyday make up!</li>
      <li>Looks amazing on my skin but isn&#x27;t long wear if you have oily skin like me.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the foundation itself, it looks very natural on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a different shade than the healthy mix serum.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so light, I feel like I&#x27;m not wearing anything but still has enough coverage!  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I ordered some and it covers very well.</li>
      <li>I hope this continues to be available on Amazon because I definitely will purchase it again and again!</li>
      <li>But, honestly, unless you have a very warm skin tone, this is crazy yellow.</li>
      <li>My skin is on the cool side of neutral, and this foundation was made for people with straight up yellow skin.</li>
      <li>Especially with a beauty blender or buffed in for a more sheer application.</li>
      <li>It looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>However this shade was too dark for me, so I gave it to my mom for her to enjoy.</li>
      <li>Loooove this foundation for my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Iam 41 years old.</li>
      <li>You only need a pea sized drop to cover your whole face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> this is THE BEST !!!!! the best foundation I&#x27;ve tried !!! girls believe me I&#x27;m a makeup artist and this product is amazing!!!!!!!!!!! I just love it !!</li>
    <li> A nice alternative when I don&#x27;t feel like using BB cream.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating for my dry skin...in combination with my wet Real Techniques beauty sponge this foundation goes on perfectly.</li>
    <li> has a great fruity smell! light coverage. easy to apply. perfect for day to day occasions.</li>
    <li> Great blendable coverage and smells great.  No breakouts, doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing any foundation.  Such a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real thing. Not impressed. The label seemed to peeling off in a weird way.</li>
    <li> i think it is a very good foundation, i love the medium coverage it has, and the demi matte finish is beautiful, and i think you can build it... but it is not meant for oily or combination skin, it does wear off through out the day, i mean it just dissappear, and it makes me look very oily...</li>
    <li> I have been very interested in trying this foundation for awhile now. I am beyond happy that I have!! This foundation is so beautiful on the skin. Especially with a beauty blender or buffed in for a more sheer application. Great for dryer skin types. I love this product &amp; will never be without it again!! I reached out to this seller to ask a quick question &amp; they are very kind &amp; prompt.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation it goes on great and has great coverage. It color is lighter then I was expecting but I mix it with a slightly darker foundation that I already have and its perfect. I would definatley order again but I would get a shade or 2 darker. (I purchased #52)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a different shade than the healthy mix serum.  It&#x27;s orange and I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> I do like the color and finish, but it arrived with a broken seal and it smells awful. Literally like rotten fruit. I put it on over an hour ago and I can still smell that gross smell. I am so disappointed because I was really looking forward to this foundation. I will keep using it over the next couple of weeks and see if the foundation makes up for the way it smells.</li>
    <li> This is awesome foundation. I saw this on a top 10 best foundations list online. It was resonably priced. I ordered some and it covers very well. I have the powder from this company also and love all the products thus far!</li>
    <li> I have VERY dry skin but this applied fairly smoothly except on my forehead.  My forehead must be extra dry.  I get a medium to full coverage with this which I wanted.  The color matched my skin perfect.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute BEST foundation!  Has really benefited my skin and makes a very smooth finish that looks and stays put!  It smells really nice too!</li>

It is easy to blend, leaves a nice finish and is neither dried out nor dewy. It looks very natural.  It is good value for money as similar foundations sell for multiples of the price of this foundation.</li>
    <li> Loooove this foundation for my extremely sensitive skin. Fabulous coverage.</li>
    <li> This gamble definitely paid off. I spent what seemed like forever trying to figure out what color to buy based on online color palates.  Luckily, I chose the right color. I think they are slightly darker than other make up colors - I am usually a light beige in most makeups; but, I went with the Vanilla color which is one shade lighter and it was a perfect match. (Also, the vanilla is a color match to the Ivory to Fair #10 in the Neutrogena healthy skin enhancer - if that helps.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this makeup.  It has a light fruity smell which is nice.  I use a makeup brush to blend it in and It covers nicely and feels good on my skin.  I hope this continues to be available on Amazon because I definitely will purchase it again and again!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight foundation with medium coverage that lets your skin breath than that&#x27;s the foundation for you</li>
    <li> I loved this foundation! it&#x27;s great for everyday make up! it&#x27;s so light, I feel like I&#x27;m not wearing anything but still has enough coverage!  PERFECT !!!</li>
    <li> Love this as much or more than my favorite luxury brand!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the foundation itself, it looks very natural on. However this shade was too dark for me, so I gave it to my mom for her to enjoy. I&#x27;m an nc15 in MAC if that gives you an idea. This shade would be best for 20-25 perhaps? If I can find it in a lighter shade I would purchase. Like I said I gave it away, I do not plan on returning b/c it&#x27;s a lovely foundation and I found someone who needed it.</li>
    <li> Good.a little bit dry.</li>
    <li> My skin is on the cool side of neutral, and this foundation was made for people with straight up yellow skin. I liked the consistency and the wear. The coverage could have been better, but it was still buildable. But, honestly, unless you have a very warm skin tone, this is crazy yellow.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. I like the fact that it can&#x27;t be seen &amp;#34;sitting&amp;#34; on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It is the perfect amount of dewiness and coverage.  It makes my skin look flawless and lasts all day.  I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> I heard good things about this foundation from beauty gurus on YouTube and so i decided to try it out for myself. I&#x27;m pleased with the smooth application and i love the glow it gives to my skin. I do not believe the 16 hour wear claim as after only 8 hours of wear time the foundation started to look a little patchy as it sat on my skin. This is okay tho since I don&#x27;t plan on wearing this product on my face anywhere near 16 hours. Overall, great foundation.. but next time i&amp;#34;ll purchase a shade darker for a perfect match.</li>
    <li> I really love this foundation.. However I ordered 1 shade too light so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It goes on easy and lasts for hours. it doesn&#x27;t crack or get oily looking. Very good foundation. Iam 41 years old.</li>
    <li> This is a great Foundation that blends well into your skin.</li>
    <li> Best foundation ever.</li>
    <li> This shipped quickly. The packaging was in great condition. I&#x27;m in love with the Healthy Mix Foundation. It feels fresh and light like a tinted moisturizer but the coverage is decent. Hopefully  I&#x27;m able to use this vendor again as the shade (vanilla) I use is not always in stock at Asos. Leave it to me to fall in love with a foundation you can only get easily in Europe.</li>
    <li> Like the way this make up looks on.  goes on smoothly and lasts for the 8 hour work day. Radiant?  Not sure about that.  Love the color Vanille for light skin.  I gave it a four star because it does not have a lot of coverage.  You would not want to buy this product if you want medium to significant coverage.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Delivered very quickly. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most foundations, so I was a bit worried taking a chance on this one. But boy does it work amazingly. I LOVE it and have found nothing wrong with it. It goes on smooth, and has not made me break out at all. In addition, while the shipping says 2-3 weeks. I believe it came in a little under two. So that was really nice</li>
    <li> Looks amazing on my skin but isn&#x27;t long wear if you have oily skin like me.</li>
    <li> The product came 2 weeks earlier than expected (the cali/oregon area), and was well packaged. You only need a pea sized drop to cover your whole face. Coverage is sheer but buildable. Two thin coats (drying in between) gives me a flawless face. This foundation also smells very nice! I will be buying this again.(:</li>
    <li> This is one of the best foundation I have had</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Very nice. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is it took a little over 3 weeks for delivery. But still worth the wait.</li>
