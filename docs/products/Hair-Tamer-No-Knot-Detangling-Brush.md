      <li>Would of liked this product to be a bit more &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; in weight.</li>
      <li>I would happily spend the money because it would be worth</li>
      <li>This brush is kind of magical.  </li>
      <li>One thing that I really liked about the Hair Tamer brush was its interesting shape, which was very comfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>The brush itself is a unique design and fits into the hand perfectly, which makes it super easy to hold.</li>
      <li>While I appreciate a product that isn&#x27;t too bristly that will damage my hair, I had to run it through my hair more times than I would have liked, puling out more hair than I was anticipating.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good detangling brush and this one works just right!</li>
      <li>It is made of plastic and is very light weight.</li>
      <li>After trying the Hair Tamer brush for a couple of days, I feel that it did okay in meeting its claims.</li>
      <li>LOVE this brush.</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>My hair is tangled the most after blow drying it</li>
      <li>Overall the best with ease of use.</li>
      <li>I think that the Hair Tamer would be better for people with thinner hair.</li>
      <li>once I got to the top of my head.  </li>
      <li>I am confident this will get those beach knots out go my hair in the summer.</li>
      <li>This brush has made it much more manageable to brush when I try to get it under control after washing it</li>
      <li>I love the grip on the sides it doesn&#x27;t slip and slide.</li>
      <li>but it kept falling out of my hand—I needed to have a better grip on the brush in order to work through my daughter</li>
      <li>I don’t think this is suppose to be a magic wand</li>
      <li>It smoothly combed through my hair without any pulling, tugging or semblance of tangles!</li>
      <li>Once that was all done we went and decided to put it through the most rigorous of tests we could dream up</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s mostly based on the look</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>, I know there are those out there who will love it.</li>
      <li>The shape of No Knot is more practical and easier to hold (if you are right-handed as me), if you are a left-hander this brush will probably be more</li>
      <li>so the quality seems so be better than I</li>
      <li>like they could’ve told me something more about the product on one of the sides.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It worked excellently on three girls with short hair.  </li>
      <li>so can’t comment on any static issues.  </li>
      <li>so I wasn’t sure how durable they would be with my hair</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair but the texture of my hair is fine and it knots very easily.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, so need to use fine toothed brushes and combs.  </li>
      <li>and i was able to get the knots out easily with this brush.</li>
      <li>When finished, her hair is very soft to the touch and has a great shine.  </li>
      <li>This would have been a perfect brush for when they were younger as well because it is so soft and pleasant on the scalp.</li>
      <li>I tried it on fine hair too and it works much better.</li>
      <li>Out of all the products in my order, I was most excited for this, but I felt like this brush was just okay.</li>
      <li>I love the color and it matches perfectly with my other tools at work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cute color perfect for little girls with knotty hair like my sister who uses it more than I do and she likes it, some brushes hurt if you accidentally go over your ear or touch your skin</li>
      <li>The shape is also great, it fits in the hand so naturally, almost like a mouse for a computer.</li>
      <li>My favorite part of the product is probably the design, it curves in on both sides so that you can grip it well and and hold it comfortably in your hand.</li>
      <li>It also feels awesome against your scalp, like a little massage :)</li>
      <li>It’s gentle, does the job, and amazingly doesn’t generate static.</li>
      <li>It was easy to hold on too and did get a lot of hair at once.</li>
      <li>The hair tamer was easy to control and manipulate when I ran it through my hair.</li>
      <li>This lightweight brush fits well into the grip of your hand, and worked satisfactory with fine hair, detangling with ease.</li>
      <li>and it got all the gnarly-ness out of my hair, even the fine hair at the nape of my neck...</li>
      <li>Since most hairbrushes are problematic for my waist-long hair, I was very interested in trying the Hair Tamer brush.</li>
      <li>The shape of it is also nice, very comfortable and natural to hold.</li>
      <li>The size of the hair tamer fit my hand comfortably</li>
      <li>I will use this brush for myself and enjoy not fighting a comb or brush to get tangles out.</li>
      <li>I also lose a lot of hair so detangling without damaging my hair is important.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The design is effective. I occasionally have to snap the body of it back together (as it tends to separate with use) otherwise I would give it 5 stars. I decided to try it on my backcombed hair and surprisingly it brushed it all out within a few strokes. Worth it!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair but the texture of my hair is fine and it knots very easily.  In the last year I purchased a “Wet” Brush and it has been unbelievable.  Before using the Wet Brush I would never dare to use a regular brush on my wet hair to detangle it.  I always had to use a comb to detangle my hair if it was wet.  It would take 15+ minutes and I would pull out a few chunks of my hair every time.  The Wet Brush is so fantastic, has saved my hair, and saved me lots of time.  Since using the Wet Brush, I have also seen ones that are very similar to the brush listed here, such as the Tangle Teezer.  I was hearing such great things and thought to try this product since it costs less than the Tangle Teezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thoughts upon taking the “Hair Tamer Pink Detangling Brush ” out of the packaging are the following:  I do not like the look of this product in person.  It looks very cheap, like a doll’s brush or Happy Meal toy.  It looks like it has been broken and re-glued back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then used the Hair Tamer Pink Detangling Brush and was pleasantly surprised because it does work, on both wet and dry hair.  It is good at getting knots and tangles out of my hair but it does not compare at all to the Wet Brush.  If I had come across this product before the Wet Brush I would love it because it is still world’s better than combing or brushing out your hair with a regular brush/comb.  But since I established a relationship with the Wet Brush first this does not hold a candle to it.  The product does not get the deep tangles out.  I did spend a few minutes detangling with this brush.  After using it, I then used my Wet Brush only to find that there were several areas of hair with tangles that the pink detangling brush was not able to get out.  I think that the pink detangling brush does not penetrate as deeply as the Wet Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you like the look of this product and have a hard time detangling your hair definitely give this a shot. But, if you already own the Wet Brush, do not bother buying this because it will not work as well.  I will be storing this in my beach bag rather than getting rid of it completely.</li>
    <li> After opening the package, I noticed that the brush isn&#x27;t put together very well.  There were gaps and spaces that looked like it may have been dropped several times and pulling apart.  My hair is course and I find that the bristles are not firm enough.  I felt the pressure of the brush on my head but it wasn&#x27;t effective at all.  I DO like the shape of the brush.  There is kind of a natural feel in the way your thumb and fingers grasp it and although it didn&#x27;t make the brush slip resistant in the shower, it did make it easier to hold on to. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product to my friends. It may be fine for someone with really fine hair that doesn&#x27;t tangle much, but it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I got this hair tamer detangling hair brush on Monday. I had my daughter use it as she has long thick hair that is always tangled. She used it dry and found it did not do much as her hair is too thick and the bristles are very soft. She also tried it with her hair wet this morning and same thing it did not work for her. HOWEVER I used this brush and it worked perfectly on my neck length thick hair!! I usually pick my hair to get all the tangles out and by the time the tangles are gone so is my hairdo. I recommend this brush for all hair types except long thick hair. I love the color! The price is reasonable. I will use this brush for myself and enjoy not fighting a comb or brush to get tangles out. It would be a great brush for children&#x27;s hair and seniors. I like the soft bristles that I feel will prevent splitends which is a plus!</li>
    <li> This brush works well on thin and fine hair. Does not work with thick and coarse hair. Works better when hair is wet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll first start off by saying that I love the way this brush is shaped. It fits perfectly in my hand with the curved design of the brush, its awesome and very comfortable to use! It was a little awkward in my nondominant hand because of the shape, but I mostly use my dominant hand anyways, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Second, the bristles worked very well at detangling my hair after I got out of the shower, which is usually a mess! I have very thick hair and it worked through it like a breeze. This product was sent to me free to try and I&#x27;m very glad that I tried it. If I ever need a new one, I would definitely buy another one!</li>
    <li> Since most hairbrushes are problematic for my waist-long hair, I was very interested in trying the Hair Tamer brush. After trying the Hair Tamer brush for a couple of days, I feel that it did okay in meeting its claims. One thing that I really liked about the Hair Tamer brush was its interesting shape, which was very comfortable to hold. As for detangling, my hair is pretty thick so the Hair Tamer brush was able to detangle only my hair from the ears down. My hair is tangled the most after blow drying it and I found that the brush was not able to detangle the hair near my scalp. I think that the Hair Tamer would be better for people with thinner hair.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush seem to be too short and a little flimsy. I used this on my hair and though it did take out the tangles, I had to brush forever just to get through my hair. The plastic casing doesn&#x27;t seem like it would hold up too long but is comfortable in the palm of your hand.</li>
    <li> I received this product free of charge as part of SalonGuys&#x27; Market Research Program and sincerely do state that it&#x27;s the most disappointing product I&#x27;ve received thus far. My review on this product is being written in the most unbiased form possible, and to be fair I had my father try the brush on his hair in order for us to compare and contrast our experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found disappointing is the actual assembly of the brush itself - I feel that it was made from cheap materials and although you do get a nice grip from its considerate ergonomic design (which they did construct nicely!), that&#x27;s as much grip as you get! I have naturally curly hair that is only evidently curly when wet, since I always dry it straight, and noticed that it managed my hair better when straight (and already dry and detangled) than when wet (when knots tend to occur during the washing process, especially after shampooing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are weak and a bit too flimsy for my liking, but when my father tried it on his dry hair, he loved it. My father has a full set of medium coarse hair (with a standard short haircut) and he is constantly brushing it, a detail which allows him to be a fair judge on this brush&#x27;s performance. I ended up giving him the brush (much to his delight, despite maybe the bright pink color not being his favorite thing :-) and I continue using my standard and very generic detangler brush that my mother gave me many years ago (those which you find at 99 cents stores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I do not recommend this brush, but am grateful that my father has a new brush he loves!</li>
    <li> This gentle little hairbrush is absolutely what I needed for a detangling brush. I used it in the shower after I applied conditioner. It not only helps to evenly distribute the conditioner, but then I have the benefit of the detangling action which means less hair breakage, after I get out of the shower and comb my hair out.  I also love the fact that it is small in size but gets the job done like larger brushes.  It’s easy to use and not painful at all like other brushes I have used.  I have found it easy to handle and it is great to travel with.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of the Salon Guys market research program.  I have waist length fine, straight, highlighted hair.  I brush my hair often with a large paddle type brush and have no issue.  I tried this detangled and the only things I liked about it was its color and its shape.  The bristles were not long enough to get through even my fine hair.  This brush made my hair instantly staticy and I HATE THAT SO MUCH! The bristles feel very flimsy and when I tried it on my daughters very thick, knotty, corse hair, it got stuck and did not work at all.  I could not get it through even the parts of her hair that were not tangled.  I would not buy this type of brush for myself, maybe it is better for a man&#x27;s short hair or a lady&#x27;s bob cut style or shorter, but not for long hair.</li>
    <li> This product was sent to me for review by Salon Guys. I wasn&#x27;t impressed upon first view of this brush but I gave it a go at the salon. I used this brush on short hair as well as fine long hair. This brush feels cheap and doesn&#x27;t really have a purpose other taking up more space in my cart. It did not ease the detangle process and I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this on my own.</li>
    <li> This styling tool is really pretty aesthetically (I have the pink one), a great size, and feels so comfortable in hand, regardless if you are left or right handed. I love that the bristles are so flexible and that there are two different lengths of bristles scattered throughout. This makes it great for getting out tangles in both upper and lower layers of your hair. The box it came in was nice and it seemed really fancy but I thought it was a little weird and redundant that it said the same thing on both sides of the box, like they could’ve told me something more about the product on one of the sides. Using the product feels amazing on my hair and scalp, it doesn’t hurt at all and it doesn’t make my hair puffy or frizzy like other brushes do. It works great on both wet AND dry hair which is something I wouldn’t say about many other brushes. This is probably gonna turn out to be one of my favorite styling tools! I received this product free of charge as a part of the Salon Guys Market Research program in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This detangler is pretty good but not necessarily a must have. I tried this on myself when I first got it. I have very thick hair and the bristles weren&#x27;t stiff enough to really do anything, they just folded over when they got to a tangle. I tried it on fine hair too and it works much better. The shape is also great, it fits in the hand so naturally, almost like a mouse for a computer. I definitely recommend this product if you have fine hair but its not a universal brush. Also on the plus side its pink, and that&#x27;s always fun!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this to get the knots out of her hair.  It is the only device that she has found that glides through her hair and causes little to no pain due to pulling when her hair is knotted or tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other brush comb or product that she has used has been able to remove the knots and tangles without causing significant tugging and discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it myself and it easily glides though my extremely thick hair and makes grooming my hair straight back a breeze.  My hair is very difficult to style and tends to go in the direction it wants.  This little brush pushes it straight back with a little product and little effort.</li>
    <li> This is great product. I received it through a Market Research Program. I got the product in a timely manner and I was very well treated by the seller if I had questions. I absolutely love this product. Its great for tangled hair or just to smooth an already in place style. I used it on wet hair it also did well, dry hair is no obstacle for this little baby.  I even tangled my hair on purpose to test what it could do. I was very pleasantly surprised. Very happy with this and I plan on using it on my toughest clients. The bristles are rubbery so it doesn&#x27;t hurt when it catches a tangle. it would be great for kids or adults with scalp sensitivity. The shape of it is also nice, very comfortable and natural to hold.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this, my initial reaction was that it was just a cheap brush that looked awkward to hold. However to my surprise this brush was amazing! It&#x27;s gentle plastic bristles massage your as they untangle your hair. The symmetrical curve is somewhat awkward at first, but you&#x27;ll soon find the comfort and ease in holding it. My absolute favorite feature though, is the subtle curve in the brush itself that forms to your head. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product. The only reason I am giving four stars is because it does feel like it&#x27;s made of a cheaper plastic.</li>
    <li> The Hair Tamer Detangling Hair Brush is Awesome!! It is really great to brush thru wet or dry hair. It does not pull the clients hair, and is very gentle on the scalp. The teeth on the brush are soft and flexiable that it does not rake or dig in the client scalp. It works really well on children that are tender headed, as well as adults hair too. I love the grip on the sides it doesn&#x27;t slip and slide. I would say that if you are left handed it is very uncomfortable. If you have long fingers and fingernails, it seems to be a little uneasy to hold on too.</li>
    <li> Received this as part of Salon Guys.  I used it on my natural curly hair, my friend used on her 8 year old daughters as well as her dog.  It seemed to work ok, not any better than a soft brush.  It was easy to hold on too and did get a lot of hair at once.</li>
    <li> The box of this item is damaged . I wanted to give it to my friend as a gift, but I cant do that anymore because of the damaged box</li>
    <li> SalonGuys sent me an assorted pack of sample items to review that included this detangler brush. After giving it a decent workout on long wet permed hair and also backcombed (teased) dry hair: Sorry, it both looks and feels like a cheap toy from the dollar store. One that takes twice as long to get the job done, and feels awkward to hold.</li>
    <li> This hair detangling brush has a nice, contoured shape that fits naturally in the hand. Unfortunately, the plastic feels a bit cheap, and one of the seams between the plastic pieces is not entirely flush with the adjoining section. It works well to detangle hair without catching or snagging; however, using it on dry hair does create quite a bit of static and &amp;#34;frizz.&amp;#34; I recommend using it only on wet hair just after a shower or in conjunction with a mist spray bottle to help keep frizz in check. All in all, a good product held back slightly by quality of materials and minor complications during use.</li>
    <li> Received this through the Salon Guys.  I would not recommend this product for anyone who actually has hair.  While I have thick hair, I used it on my nephew and my niece who don&#x27;t.  Not only did it not go through any of their hair, it created static instantly.  There seems to be no use for this product at all.  It is also awkward to hold as well.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product because I have really thick, wavy, long hair that gets tangled easily. What I got was a lightweight box with thin, plastic, bendable tines that didn’t do any better of a job detangling my hair than a typical brush. In fact, just using a brush is probably better because one of those actually brushes your hair rather than just sliding over it or getting caught in it. It wasn’t pain-free, either, and pulled on my hair as it tried to “detangle” it. Maybe this works better for people with fine or straight hair, but it definitely wasn’t for me.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It really does the job when it comes to detangling hair. The bristles are so flexible that they simply glide through the tangles without pulling or yanking on hair. The shape of the brush allows you to have a comfortable controlled grip.This is a product that those who have or wear extensions MUST HAVE!  Not to mention it would be great to use on kids with tangly hair. This is hands down an amazing product, say good bye to all of those detangling sprays and hello to the Hair Tamer No Knot Brush.</li>
    <li> Love the idea of a &amp;#34;tangle free&amp;#34; head of hard... however... This is not the solution for long fine hair. It is a great scalp massager...and my cats LOVE it! Bristles are just too flimsy to grab tangles. Also made for right handed people. Not us leftys... sad. Worked great on my roommates hair. She has short hair.</li>
    <li> This product is comfortable to hold as it fits well in my hand.  The bristles are soft but seemed pretty flimsy so I wasn’t sure how durable they would be with my hair (I have thick hair).  The hair tamer slid through my hair fairly easily but since the bristles are kinda short it was not able to go all the way through my hair, so I had to brush the underside as well.  I have only used this on wet hair so can’t comment on any static issues.  The color selection is fun and the bright pink makes it easy to locate amongst my other hair tools.  Overall I will probably continue to use but not sure if I will immediately replace.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as a teezer yet but I have used it to brush my hair. Nothing particularly special, I like that it doesn&#x27;t pull too much and it fits well in my hand.</li>
    <li> Out of all the products in my order, I was most excited for this, but I felt like this brush was just okay. The first time I used it I felt like the bristles were so soft that it wasn’t even strong enough to go through my hair, as if it just slid right over the hair and did nothing. I had to really force it in there in order for it to brush. I tried using it again, and although I would say it does work, it takes a lot of time in order to get it to work. It’s also just a little bit too small which makes it hard to hold. I’d rather just use my normal brush that I already have.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of the Salon Guys Market Research.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit I was a little worried about the quality when i received this hair tamer. It was a bit poorly packaged so the box it was in was lumpy and the &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; or what to call them.. on the brush was already bent at the sides, so that it tends to be after any month of use.&lt;br /&gt;But now when i have been using it for about a week there is no difference at the spikes so the quality seems so be better than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;I have a similar hair tamer from the brand Tangle Teezer so i compared the two. The &amp;#34;No Knot&amp;#34; has fewer and a little bit thicker spikes that seems to be slightly softer than the Tangle Teezer. The shape of No Knot is more practical and easier to hold (if you are right-handed as me), if you are a left-hander this brush will probably be more uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would say it&#x27;s fairly evenly race. I prefer the tangle teezer but it&#x27;s mostly based on the look</li>
    <li> I have been seeing ads for this type of brush all over recently and was excited to try it out. I was a little skeptical because the bristles look so short, I didn&#x27;t think it would do much good detangling hair...I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it DOES! The bristles are flexible so there&#x27;s little to no pulling and it got all the gnarly-ness out of my hair, even the fine hair at the nape of my neck...after wearing a hoodie all day...in the rain..so. If it works that well on a day like today I am super impressed! It also feels awesome against your scalp, like a little massage :)</li>
    <li> I have been using the hair tamer for 3 days. I have coarse, thick hair that is damaged from years of coloring and highlighting. I was curious to try a detangling hair brush because it claims that it “glides through wet, vulnerable, and color treated hair with no pulling or tangling, and detangles even the most knotted hair.” The size of the hair tamer fit my hand comfortably and I think it is ergonomically designed well. The hair tamer was easy to control and manipulate when I ran it through my hair. My biggest complaint about the product is that the bristles were too flimsy to really detangle my hair. I tried the product when my hair was wet and when it was dry, and I still felt that the product did not do a great job in separating the knots and tangles in my hair. I had to rerun the tamer several times through my hair, and still felt there were tangles in my hair. This is my first detangler that I’ve used so I really don’t have a product to compare to, but overall, this product just didn’t work out for my thick hair. I think if you have finer hair or were looking for a tamer with softer bristles because you have sensitive scalp, this product may work out better for you.</li>
    <li> I gave my daughter who has pretty thick wavy hair to try the Hair Tamer Detangling Brush.  She used it after shampooing in place of a wide tooth comb she normally uses.  It did detangle without pulling her hair out getting all the knots out except for the crown of her head.  The bristles were not long enough to get to her scalp.  I would not recommend this brush for thick hair for this reason. Also the brush does conform to you hand but is awkward when brushing your hair.  I would prefer a brush with a normal handle.</li>
    <li> I received this product from SalonGuys as part of their marketing research program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened this hair detangling brush, I was skeptical about how well it would work. The brush does have a nice grip shape, but the smooth plastic of the main body and textured grip sections do not fit together well; there are visible cracks that long hair can get caught in. The plastic nubby teeth of the brush are soft and there are two lengths of bristles, which does help the brush catch tangles. I used this on myself (I have very short hair) and on someone with a short bob and another with long hair. The longer the hair, the less effective this product is. With long hair it is harder to hold the brush and I had to hold the hair under it while working out tangles. It does work well on short hair, and feels nice on the scalp. I could see this being a good product for using on kids or short hair, but I won&#x27;t be using it much for myself or clients.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this hair tamer.  It pulls and tugs as you brush with it.  It didn&#x27;t do any better than a regular hair brush.</li>
    <li> I received this brush as a part of a product review program from SalonGuys. When I was opening the package my daughter saw it and was very excited about a new brush for her. She has very fine, long hair that tangles up easily and she always complains about my pulling her hair when I brush it. She was a bit disappointed after she tried the brush because it pulled her hair more than the wet brush we got for her two years ago. This brush has a nice sleek design but it kept falling out of my hand—I needed to have a better grip on the brush in order to work through my daughter’s hair.&lt;br /&gt;My son, on the other hand, loves the brush, even though it’s pink, because his hair is short and the brush doesn’t pull it. It feels like he is getting a massage he says. I guess it would work great on short hair, I am not so sure about long hair.</li>
    <li> I have long, naturally curly hair that I only sort out in the shower after I’ve coated it with conditioner. I was a little skeptical how this detangler would work on my hair but I have to say so far I’ve been impressed. The “bristles” are soft plastic so they don’t tear your hair at all, but if you’ve got a really thick mane it’ll be a bit of a process getting through a complete brush out. It’s perfect for kids, especially little girls with long hair, who hate having their hair brushed. It’s gentle, does the job, and amazingly doesn’t generate static. I also REALLY like it’s shape.</li>
    <li> At first glance I thought this product wouldn&#x27;t deliver. Was I wrong! I use it on my daughter and no more tears! I just wish they had a left handed model!</li>
    <li> The product was received on time and with no damage to the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is the perfect tester for this product and she gives this hair brush an A+ !  We have purchased 3 detangling hair brushes over the past year, including the Michel Mercier brush, and this Hair Tamer brush is the best of them all.  This brush was able to reach her hair underneath, which tends to get quite messy during the day, with no pulling or tugging.  When finished, her hair is very soft to the touch and has a great shine.  Overall the best with ease of use. We have found the brush to work very well on wet hair too.  We highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, so need to use fine toothed brushes and combs.  Always my hair breaks and there&#x27;s hair in the comb or brush – especially after washing it.  This brush did not pull or break my hair.  The Hair Tamer Detangling Hair Brush glided through my hair without any resistance, and there was no hair in the brush afterwards.  My hair is shoulder-length with some wave, but no real curl.  While it works well with fine hair, I’m not sure the soft, flexible bristles would stand up to coarse hair.  I really like how it fits in my hand – that makes it especially comfortable to hold in either hand.</li>
    <li> This little brush is really adorable. I was sent the pink one, by Salon Guys, to try it out and review it. It is made of plastic and is very light weight. The actual bristles are also made of plastic but they are very flexible allowing them to brush through the hair without pulling too much. My favorite part of the product is probably the design, it curves in on both sides so that you can grip it well and and hold it comfortably in your hand. In my opinion, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend it for heavy duty tangles. What I do think would be a great use for it is for the younger children because the friendly design could motivate them to want to brush their hair. All in all, even though I really like the design I don&#x27;t love the brush.</li>
    <li> I love this little nifty thing! It really does work! I use it on all my clients and works great for kids too!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about the Hair Tamer Pink &#x27;Knot Today&#x27; Detangling Teezer Brush at first glance.  My hair is thick and I thought there was no way this little pinkie brush could do anything for me.  Boy, are looks deceiving!  While it was true that it could hardly &#x27;comb&#x27; through my dry hair, addressing my wet hair was an entirely different matter!  After feeling discouraged while attempting to &#x27;comb&#x27; through dry hair with it, I thought I&#x27;d try it after washing and towel drying.  WOW, what a difference that made!  It smoothly combed through my hair without any pulling, tugging or semblance of tangles! I am impressed!  My hair was smooth and ready to face the blow dryer!  I feel it even styled better as a result!</li>
    <li> This lightweight brush fits well into the grip of your hand, and worked satisfactory with fine hair, detangling with ease. Would of liked this product to be a bit more &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; in weight. I usually use a wide tooth detangling comb so this felt a bit awkward at first but yet again removed the tangles without pulling or discomfort.  I was pleasantly surprised that it did such a good job, since it&#x27;s teeth are flexible plastic and vary in length (short and long rows).</li>
    <li> From the moment I took this hair tamer out of the box, I was concerned about it&#x27;s functionality.  To start, the design that left off the handle was a mistake. If you have hair that is tough to brush through (like my daughters), you need to have a good grip. I couldn&#x27;t get a good grip, it kept slipping out of my hand when using it on really tangled hair.  The brush feels/looks cheaply made.  It is something I would expect to find at the dollar store.  My 10 year old daughter tried it out and her feedback was that the bristles weren&#x27;t long enough to get through her thick hair.  The only thing I liked about the brush was its pretty pink color.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous trying the Detangler Hair Tamer, I’ve seen reviews for similar products that were used on Coily (4C) hair and they all stated they notice hair breakage after use.  I decided try it out on freshly washed hair that had plenty of conditioner on it.  My results were alright, the Detangler worked pretty well on the back of my head, the tool was hard for me to hold on to once I got to the top of my head.  For the sake of time I used the tool on about half my head and then starting just finger detangling instead.  I noticed that by me being a left-handed person, it was much more comfortable to use with my right hand.  I even tried turning the tool upside down and both ways were more comfortable right handed. That was a little disappointing, because it would have been nice to be able to flip the tool and be used comfortably with the left hand. In my right hand it does have an ergonomic/ comfortable feel to it.</li>
    <li> When I first pulled this detangling brush from the package I was highly skeptical; the grip was nice but I and one of my two daughters have long and thick hair and the bristles did not seem to be capable of detangling such hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, we went away for the weekend and I took this brush with me.  We were going swimming and chlorine really dries out the hair which even after a good washing and condition our hair tends to still be a bit of a tangled mess.  In the past tears would flow from my eldest daughter who has long and thick hair as I tried to get her chlorine dried hair under control.  We also had three other girls with us whose hair I would have to see too after swimming so I figured that would be the best time to try out this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked excellently on three girls with short hair.  I moved on to the two girls with long hair thinking the brush would fail to perform especially since one of them had hair that was thicker than the other.  To my surprise there were no tears, no \\&quot;ouch\\&quot;, no fighting.  They sat there completely still as this brush made quick work of the tangles.  It was almost like magic!  Once that was all done we went and decided to put it through the most rigorous of tests we could dream up and that was my hair.  I have very long hair that has a lot of body.  To my knowledge every stylist I have ever gone to has declared it the thickest hair they have ever worked with as well.  My husband sat behind me and got to it.  I was absolutely floored and fell in love with this brush.  It worked through my hair as easily as it had worked through the other heads it had been tested on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is hands down the BEST detangling product I have ever come across; no dentangling serum, no detangling spray, and most certainly no detangling brush has ever managed to perform to the standards it advertised, at least never on my hair!  While I received this brush as part of a product testing program in order to review I can honestly say if it wasn&#x27;t something I got to keep and had to instead send it back or pay for it I would happily spend the money because it would be worth every penny!y if it wasn&#x27;t something I got to keep and had to instead send it back or pay for it I would happily spend the money because it would be worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This brush is neat in design. It fits well in my hand and I don&#x27;t seem to lose my grip on it  it gets through my tangled mess and it helps smooth hair into special event styles that need a good hold to help pin up hair. My only concern is for how long it will hold up for. The bristles seem to be fragile and with it being so light weight it may fall a lot and could break.I love the color and it matches perfectly with my other tools at work.</li>
    <li> My hair tangles...all...the...time. Especially when it&#x27;s fresh out of the shower. You know how people tell you &amp;#34;use a wide toothed comb&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;gently untangle your hair when it&#x27;s wet.&amp;#34; Well let me tell you, it would take 2 hours to gently untangle my hair with a wide toothed comb, so I end up yanking my paddle brush through it to the horror of hair stylists everywhere. Well this brush just solved my problem. I can untangle my wet hair quickly without hurting my scalp at all. Something about the bristle&#x27;s shape, texture, and the varying lengths make it a great detangler that doesn&#x27;t break your hair. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is kind of magical.  Looking at it out of the package, I didn&#x27;t imagine it could possibly do what it said it would. HOWEVER, this brush is pretty awesome.  Its short, gentle bristles manage to detangle my hair without ripping through it like other brushes.  I look forward to how my hair fairs in the long term when using this brush!  My only concern is the construction.  It is made with light weight plastic and bristles look a bit flimsy.  Time will tell on this one, but that is the only reason for the one less star rating on this item.  I would really recommend this for someone with a sensitive scalp and/or damaged hair, as this brush is gentle yet surprisingly effective!</li>
    <li> My daughter has an abundance of long, very thick hair and this works wonders.  It takes tangles out without tugging or pulling and she can use it on wet hair or dry.  My younger daughter with thick, shorter hair also loves the fact that she can now brush her hair without it hurting her sensitive scalp and I enjoy the peace and quiet that comes with this brush since I no longer have to hear, &amp;#34;OUCH, Mommy!  You&#x27;re hurting my head!&amp;#34;  I have used this brush also and find it even a nice scalp massage while brushing my hair.</li>
    <li> I got the pink one and it is a nice color of pink.  Who doesn’t like pink?  Well if you don’t like pink get one of the other colors!  The brush is made with rubber bristles that are kind of like little fingers.  It feels good in my hand and is very comfortable to use.  I don’t think this is suppose to be a magic wand so I would say it worked as I expected it to.  Better than trying to comb out tangles with a comb or brush them out with a regular hairbrush which just isn’t easy to do.</li>
    <li> I tried using this twice. Once on a child--the other on an adult. On the child&#x27;s extra curly/coarse hair the plastic bristles were so soft it had no effect at all! On the adult&#x27;s hair, it snagged a little bit and I noticed long strands caught in between the bristles so I discontinued its usage altogether. I could see how this brush might detangle hair with a softer curl but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work well with thick, curly/coarse hair. I would recommend this product to someone with slightly wavy, thin-ish hair because the bristles are soft plastic and short.</li>
    <li> When I first received this I really was skeptical. I thought there was no way even with my thin hair that his would work. I was shocked when it did! I even have a few extensions in my hair and it was no problem at all. It didn&#x27;t pull on my hair nor my extensions like I thought it would. It is very gentle and worked a lot better than expected. It was better than my normal brush I have used for years! Now in saying this I did mention I have thin hair so at this point not sure how it would work on thicker hair or real curly hair. I would at least give it a try.</li>
    <li> I like this brush due to its unique design in that it does not have the traditional handle that most brushes have.  It allows you to easily control the pressure and direction of brushing that snarly mess that sometimes happens.  My hair is about 4 inches past my shoulders and fairly thick and sort of wavy.  This brush has made it much more manageable to brush when I try to get it under control after washing it and it&#x27;s still wet.  The design fits well in the palm of your hand.  I&#x27;d give it five stars, but I&#x27;m not sure how the plastic bristles will hold up over time.  Perhaps, I will revise if it lasts longer than I anticipate.  Overall, great design and great detangler!</li>
    <li> The bristles are limp so you can&#x27;t really tell if it is taking the knots out. It does though but you can&#x27;t really tell until you are done. I always go over it with a regular brush to make sure. It&#x27;s a cute color perfect for little girls with knotty hair like my sister who uses it more than I do and she likes it, some brushes hurt if you accidentally go over your ear or touch your skin but as I said the brushes are limp and pretty soft so I did not have a problem with that. I recommend this brush to anyone with knotty hair, although it doesn&#x27;t substitute for a real brush I also recommend using a real brush after you use the detangling brush .</li>
    <li> My boys love the black Detangling Brush! It is gentle on their scalp and perfect for their short hair. This would have been a perfect brush for when they were younger as well because it is so soft and pleasant on the scalp. I have longer hair and like the brush, but have some issues. The brush is more comfortable to use when my hair is wet. When I use a leave in conditioner without hair spray and my hair is dry it does pull my hair a little, but doesn&#x27;t seem to pull it when when no products are used. The grip is ergonomic; however, it was a little small for my larger hands. The Detangler worked well when using on small sections of hair that were minimally tangled, but for bigger knots on the back by my neck it didn&#x27;t work too well and I had to use something else. For kids this Detangler is a 5 star. For myself I wish it was a little better at getting all of the tangles out.</li>
    <li> This cute pink brush does an awesome job of de - tangling wet hair, and also just brushing out dry hair. My niece is 3 and she is NOT easy to please when it comes to brushing her hair out, so I let her mother use it and she was overly excited to say the least about finally finding something that didn&#x27;t make her daughter scream bloody murder! I have rather long hair and I found that although it works good on my hair, it is superior on shorter hair. The brush itself is a unique design and fits into the hand perfectly, which makes it super easy to hold. After I use it each time, it only takes a matter of seconds to clean any hair out of the bristles, and the brush looks brand new each time! A great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I gave this brush to my friend and she absolutely oves it! She likes it because it doesn&#x27;t snag on her hair like other brushes that she has used in the past. The brush is fits perfectly in your hand. She like how even though it it doesn&#x27;t have a traditional handle design, it is designed to comfortably rest your hand in the groves. The side color is more of a pink color than the red color that featured in the image. My only concern is that the plastic bristles will break off due to age. But other than that, this brush is amazing.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of the Salon Guys Market Research.  The product is just as pictured, but found that the ergonomic design of the handle was a bit large for me.  I used the brush on my wet, fine, and wavy hair.  I also lose a lot of hair so detangling without damaging my hair is important.  While I appreciate a product that isn&#x27;t too bristly that will damage my hair, I had to run it through my hair more times than I would have liked, puling out more hair than I was anticipating.  It simply didn&#x27;t penetrate as deep in my hair as I would have liked so I ended up having to brush it more than usual - like I said, I have thin hair and this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  The bristles are pretty short and soft, so I&#x27;m thinking that this would be perfect for a little girl who hates having her hair brushed out.  While not a brush that I plan to use, I know there are those out there who will love it.</li>
    <li> The hair tamer brush works really well. Its great for kids and people with curly hair. The brush bristles are gentle on the scalp which is nice.  although for me it was not so comfortable to hold it. I am left handed so it did not feel right holding it. Maybe if you had one side formed for a left hand and a right hand form for the other side. I like the color of the hair tamer brush but would have liked it if it had the same material as the mist spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good detangling brush and this one works just right! It leaves my hair feeling soo soft after using it. My hair gets really tangled in the shower and this works like a charm to avoid breakage and frizzy hair! The bristles are gentle but definitely do their job and it fits perfectly in my hand. I love the pink color (what girl doesn&#x27;t)!</li>
    <li> This completely detangled my hair! I have thin hair that knots very easily and i was able to get the knots out easily with this brush. The brush was easy to hold on to and small enough to travel with. I am always on the go so smaller items are essential to me. I am confident this will get those beach knots out go my hair in the summer. I can&#x27;t wait!!</li>
