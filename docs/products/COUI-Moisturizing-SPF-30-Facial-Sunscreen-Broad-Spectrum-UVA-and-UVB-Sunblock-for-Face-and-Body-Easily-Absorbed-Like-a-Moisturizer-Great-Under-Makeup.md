<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love the way this feels on my face. My 12 year old wears it as well. not oily at all. Its a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> I loved the way it made my skin feel  I wore it to the beach and didn&#x27;t get sunburned  the cream worked very well</li>
    <li> I like this product since I get no eye irritation when I sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful sunscreen. It goes on easily, absorbs quickly without leaving a residue and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tender part of my body that burns easily; this sunscreen prevents that area from getting burned. When that area gets burned, it is really uncomfortable and hurts a lot. It even happens if I&#x27;m outside a long time and it is slightly overcast. Coui SPF 30 sunscreen was easy to apply there and kept that tender area burn free. I&#x27;m not a fan of wearing a hat, and this lets me walk around exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen makes me feel good about using it. It doesn&#x27;t feel like hotel lotion with sunblock. Instead it is a good moisturizer that happens to have sunscreen in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily for 6 weeks and enjoy it. Prior to receiving Coui moisturizing sunscreen, I had been using a separate moisturizer and sunscreen. I appreciated the combination of both in this product, saving time during my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons I have waited 6 weeks to write this review is because I wanted to see if the moisturizer in this product would be adequate for my very dry skin in cooler weather. I received this product in mid-September and it was still quite warm where I live. The moisturizer in this product was just right for my skin in that weather. However, as the weather has started to cool these last few weeks, I have found it inadequate to moisturize my skin. As a result, I have to add a layer of my previous moisturizer (Olay Complete) under the COUI to compensate for this. If you have normal-to-oily skin, this very likely won&#x27;t be a problem for you; however, if you have dry-to-very-dry skin as I do, I suspect it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other slight negative is that, while the lotion appears to be fragrance free, there is somewhat of an &amp;#34;anti-fragrance;&amp;#34; i.e., the absence of fragrance in a product sometimes leads to a strange, sometimes medicinal, smell. I notice this more when applying it to my skin than when it is in the bottle. Again, this may not be a problem for most people because I am especially fragrance sensitive. In fact, I gave some to my Little Sister to use on a road trip and she commented on how good it smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does NOT have a strong sunscreen smell, though, and I very much appreciate that. Another thing I liked is how little of the product I needed to cover my entire face and neck. This means you will get more bang for your buck--a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, despite having very dry and somewhat sensitive skin, I have had absolutely no skin irritation or negative reactions to this product. This product was provided to me by the manufacturer in exchange for a fair and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 2/14/15: I used this for the first time in a few months yesterday and it seemed to have a somewhat rancid smell, though perhaps this was just the &amp;#34;anti-fragrance&amp;#34; I mentioned above and I had forgotten what it smelled like.or a fair and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 2/14/15: I used this for the first time in a few months yesterday and it seemed to have a somewhat rancid smell, though perhaps this was just the &amp;#34;anti-fragrance&amp;#34; I mentioned above and I had forgotten what it smelled like.</li>
    <li> I love it, it works well, very light  and no smell</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I was told by a plastic surgeon not to lay in a tanning bed any more, That it was causing damage to my face, So when I was told how great this product was I decided to try it. It is amazing I love it when I went back he put me back under the light and he said it was a big improvement to my skin, I am excited to see how much more this product can do. Its a wonderful product and I would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Perfect sunscreen for fall. You can still get a sunburn in fall and should still protect your skin. Only thing uncovered is my face so I can use it and not have to worry about oil build up on my face. Rubs in well and works excellent. Not an oily sunblock.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works  great ....it blends on skin easily and doesn&#x27;t have your typical sunscreen smell....Highly reccomended</li>
    <li> Really good, Works great on my skin, its not grease, heave its just perfect..Doesnot burn the skin if it is sensitive skin, just a love it . I will get more .</li>
    <li> This is an awesome sunscreen.  It has a great smell and texture too.  I have even started using it under my makeup.  It gives my skin a smooth, fresh feeling, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy under my makeup.  I will continue to use it and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have not have a change to use it yet, since it&#x27;s winter time. But i love the smell and texture (non greasy) of it.</li>
    <li> Great SPF for your face. I used this for the first time on Sunday while kayaking in Florida. I was on the water for six hours in the sun and this worked great! Didn&#x27;t break me out, either. I&#x27;ll def. keep buying.</li>
    <li> love it very effective</li>
    <li> Light, non-greasy, great for oily skin, can be applied over makeup</li>
    <li> Facial? Um, no. I am a greaseball in even a tiny application of this. I can&#x27;t even wear it on my arms. I slide all over myself. Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> Beautiful sunscreen.  Very light and non-greasy feeling.  Feels wonderful on the skin.  The true test will be this summer when I see just how good the sunscreen is.</li>
    <li> I am frequently outdoors in the Southern California sun, I apply sunscreen everyday, and I have found this COUI sunscreen to be a good one. It goes on smooth, leaves no oily sheen, doesn&#x27;t leave my face white, and has plenty of beneficial ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are a few things I do not like about this product.&lt;br /&gt;This product is described a being fragrance free. And although there are no added fragrances, it contains Octinoxaste and Octisalate, which have a characteristic sunscreen odor. It is not unpleasant and doesn&#x27;t bother me but my girlfriend frequently comments that I &amp;#34;smell like sunblock.&amp;#34; She is very sensitive when it comes to smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing that I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it contains retinyl palmitate. Retinyl palmitate (Vitamin A, also inaccurately called retinol in many anti-aging formulations) is not bad in general. Retinyl palmitate is an antioxidant and can reduce fine lines and sun damage in a nightly moisturizer, but there has been a convincing body of research that suggests that it can break down into carcinogenic molecules when exposed to UV radiation and is therefore not appropriate to use in a sunscreen. The amount of harm it is doing is likely very small, and the benefit of using this sunscreen outweighs this risk for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am please with this purchase and I will continue to use this product for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> SPF 30? YES I&#x27;LL TAKE THAT! If you love your skin and wants to prevent aging, damaged skin (skin cancer), pigmentation, etc., please get you a good sunscreen. It is recommended that using a sunscreen with a high SPF such as SPF 30 gives you better protection than sunscreens with lower SPFs. So here is what I love about this sunscreen. The bottle will definitely last me months; it is lightweight; it is perfect for my oily combination skin. Oh and last one, it doesn&#x27;t break me out (I also have acne prone skin). This is perfect to use under your makeup, right before putting on your primer. It dries very easily and you don&#x27;t need a lot. I love this sunscreen :)</li>
    <li> Outstanding -- not sticky, not smelly, and effective!</li>
    <li> Amazing product - light, not oily. I bought about 10 Amazon top rated facial sunscreens to compare and this was by far the best.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have bought this for my daughter and one of my friends.  I never leave my home without putting this sunscreen on my face.  I live in Arizona....the sun is brutal...but  with this product I can be outside and not worry.</li>
    <li> THis is a good SPF. feel so light on the face. I have a sensitive skin and I always used Neutrogina  product against acne until I found out they do experiments on poor, little animals.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy my morals lead me to step away from this chemical using, mass production Neutrogina.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this product. It&#x27;s light, don&#x27;t brake me out, when I apply it next to my eyes it&#x27;s not irritating (you know what&#x27;s it&#x27;s means - no heavy use of chemicals!)&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogina SPF made me shad tears when I use it next to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Good SPF, big bottle and feels good.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen not oily</li>
    <li> I work outside every day on a pecan farm. Some days the sun is brutal. I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens. From the oily white stuff to the spray on thingies. Normally it&#x27;s a real hassle to slather the stuff on. Many times I go without because I don&#x27;t want the bother and my hands feel greasy afterwords, even through I wash them (or maybe I don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, this stuff is a joy to put on. It comes out creamy and light. Goes on smooth and blends in well. I was actually a little upset the one day I forgot to put it on. And it works great. I put it on in the morning and it last all day. I know I haven&#x27;t been burned. By this time of year with the bright spring days and the cool breezes, you don&#x27;t realize how much sun you are getting, I&#x27;ve usually been burned once already. But not this year!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it and a little goes a long way. I think my skin is even looks a little better too.</li>
    <li> excellent, very good, not greasy, protects very well!</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen very much, and I have ordered 3 when the  co had a 25% off sale. Thanks.</li>
    <li> A little thick but gives good coverage.  I prefer their other products.</li>
    <li> I find a sunscreen defeats its purpose if you&#x27;ve applied it to your face, go outside, do enough gardening to perspire &amp; have your eyes burn badly from the mixture if perspiration &amp; product dripping in your eyes. I try to buy per review but for such a price I expected better. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff! I have oily skin and this doesn&#x27;t make my face look like an oil slick after a couple of hours. Spreads easily so you don&#x27;t need a whole lot. Applying too thick will give you a white cast. I&#x27;m definitely ordering more when this runs out! Thanks, Coui!</li>
    <li> I used this sunscreen last weekend and did not burn in the sun.  Goes on nicely- great coverage.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait for summer to use this product</li>
    <li> It felt a little greasy on my face to me.</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy with this sunscreen overall. While it definitely is more moisturizing than most sunscreens, it is not sweat or water proof in the slightest. The moment any of my body got wet, the area would turn white and it would look exactly like I had just put it on and not rubbed it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on sweating or getting in the water, go with a different sunscreen. Once it gets wet it looks terrible, gets on everything, and is highly ineffective.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial sunscreen. It isn&#x27;t heavy, and although it leaves a little sheen at first it quickly absorbs into the skin. I use it every day and have used to on days when I&#x27;m going to be in the sun a lot and did not burn at all. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Worn alone, this sunscreen is fine, but when used with another moisturizer underneath, I have issues with it not absorbing properly.  It is not as light a product as anticipated based on other reviews.  I&#x27;ll finish the bottle, but will try something else next time.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. The consistency is very slightly thicker than in standard sunscreens, but I find it to be moisturizing, so I don&#x27;t need to add another moisturizer. I have normal/dry skin, but not extremely dry skin. It is not shiny or greasy, and no stickiness. I hesitated a little because it has some zinc oxide, and sometimes those are white and take a while to run in. This does not cause any of that - no whiteness, just absorbs right in. I&#x27;m a true sunscreen queen, with very fair skin that burns easily when not protected. No question I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. I have always hated to use sunscreen because of the feel of it on my skin and the smell. As I age I felt like I should use sunscreen on exposed skin more. I already use the COUI serums and really like their products. This sunscreen did not disappoint. It feels like a really good moisturizer on my skin. There is no odor at all.</li>
    <li> Coui SPF 30 Sunscreen is good to use as daily protection from the sun. It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin greasy. So that is a real plus. When using it when you are going outdoors for an extended period of time I would however urge caution. You may need to apply this more than once when in the sun for over an hour. I used this sunscreen all over my body and I was able to stay in the sun for an hour. Only my cheeks were a little pink when I came back inside. So maybe apply this every 30 minutes to be safe. Because I have such fair skin I probably need SPF 50 on my face if I&#x27;m outside for more than half an hour. But the rest of my body seemed well protected when I used this. I will however also say that this made my skin feel calm and it did not irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one free tube of this product for review. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Nice consistency, and smells great!</li>
    <li> I have never liked sunscreen because it feels too thick and makes my skin look greasy. That said I do use it faithfully as I reside at 6300 feet and have fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a regular purchaser of OUI&#x27;s Vitamin C and Super C serum, both great products, and I was asked if I would be interested in trying their new sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can state there is only one sunscreen that I like - COUI SPF 30 Sunscreen. It is not too thick, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me appear greasy. I will be a regular purchaser of all three of their products. Well done!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is nice and thick..I always worry when sunscreen is thin. I&#x27;m worried that my children will burn. This had a light smell. It is pleasant. I have used this on my children and myself. We have had no issues.</li>
    <li> The weather is cool in Texas now, but being out in the sunshine has not disappeared with the heat.  There’s still lots of gardening to be done, and when I’m outside, I tend to get a sunburned nose.  No longer with this SPF 30 cream.  It goes on without a greasy residue, soaks in quickly, and keeps the sunburn away from my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can wear it under makeup because of the speed with which it is absorbed in the skin, and it actually creates a nice base for whatever you’re putting on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product at a very modest price.  I couldn’t ask for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> I recently tried the super c serum from COUI, and have been impressed with the results, so when I had the opportunity to try this sunscreen I was very excited. I have been using this product for a little over two weeks now, with excellent results. Here is what I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and this product is unscented and does not cause me to break out. It is light and non-greasy so you don&#x27;t notice it on your skin like many sun protection formulas. I found that it absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t have to spend forever trying to get it to disappear and it leaves no white residue behind on your face. I also love that your hands don&#x27;t feel gross after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days I noticed that the condition of my skin seemed to be improving. My skin tone looked more even and by the end of the two weeks I definitely  noticed improvement and even started receiving compliments from other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend a lot of time in the sun during the day, walking my dogs and playing with my kids, and I have not noticed a sun burn, even on my nose and cheeks since using this product. It lasts on the skin for a good while so it isn&#x27;t necessary to re-apply very often, even when you are sweating, and it can be worn under make-up without anyone being able to tell it is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the other sunscreens I have tried burn my eyes if it gets into them and make them sting for hours. I haven&#x27;t noticed that at all with this product. The bottle is a good size and the packaging is lovely. The bottle is small enough to carry in a handbag without it taking up all the space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this sunblock and would definitely recommend it to other consumers. Way better than the off the shelf stuff I usually buy.</li>
    <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good face moisturizer that also has SPF and so I was excited to hear about this product. The product was nicely and attractively packaged. The tube is easy to use and very portable if you need to take it on a trip. I haven&#x27;t had any leakage problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin. so the next test was whether I&#x27;d break out with the product. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks without problems. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance, and it applies on smoothly, soaking up quickly. It&#x27;s not greasy either, which is another big plus. I haven&#x27;t had any sunburn or sun damage after application, but I also haven&#x27;t been out in the sun a lot for the past two weeks. After I&#x27;ve used the product longer, I may adjust this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is good and something I would think of getting again after I run out. I&#x27;ll definitely be recommending this to my friends and family!</li>
    <li> Not for anyone with sensitive skin and it made my eyes burn and water.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It is so easily absorbed and feels great on my skin, not greasey and no residue because it has some kind of Zinc complex that protects the best, without being chalkey and  obvious.[[ASIN:B00M21V4UA COUI SPF 30 Sunscreen for Face and Body - Advanced Protection for Youthful Skin. Rich in Vitamins, Antioxidants and Moisturizers - Easily Absorbed Like No Other Sunblock Cream - Broad Spectrum UVA &amp; UVB (2.5 0z.)]]</li>
    <li> very happy with my purchase : )</li>
    <li> I recognized half the ingredients, and the other half... I researched because that&#x27;s what I do as a reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, COUI&#x27;s sunscreen does not contain Petroleum Distillates or Sodium Laurate, a major advantage. However, I must note that the form of vitamin E is Tocopherol Acetate, which is a particular issue a family member, whom this was intended for, has with vitamin E. She uses only the purer, basic tocopherol form and absolutely avoids all Vitamin E acetates when it comes to skin care. It&#x27;s a matter of subjective decision, but one I must take heed of. As for the rest of the ingredients, I used the Environmental Working Group database as my source, and all ingredients were classified overall as safe/low risk with a few caveats that I noted:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEG-100 Stearate - Cleansing Agent // risk caveat: do not use on open skin wounds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glyceryl Stearate - Emulsifying Agent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C 12-15 Alkyl Benzoate - anti-microbacterial; skin conditioning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ceteareth-20 - Cleansing Agent // risk caveat: do not use on open skin wounds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyclomethicone - Emollient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetyl Dimethicone Copolyol - Antifoaming Agent; Skin-Conditioning Agent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone - Antifoaming Agent; Skin-Conditioning Agent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tetrasodium EDTA - Chelating Agent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Methylparaben - Fragrance Ingredient; Preservative&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sodium) Hyaluronic Acid - A Dr. Oz highlighted ingredient, natural occurring moisture-binding ingredient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium PCA - another natural occurring skin-conditioning agent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diazolidinyl Urea - formaldehyde-releasing preservative // risk caveat: this has been noted as a allergy agent, yet as the most minute ingredient in this skin cream, the risk itself is extremely low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also quite an interesting selection of other ingredients, such as Green Tea extract, Chamomile, Ginseng, Ginko Biloba, and Licorice extract. Like a power smoothie for the skin! It does rub in quite nicely with ZERO of the normally expected greasiness. Generally speaking, this is a super nice UV Facial Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas for the acetate form of the Vitamin E as this alone precludes from that family member from using the product, which is why I can only rate it on a subjective four stars along with the especial note to be aware of not placing this products on any open cuts, and be aware of the very low-risk yet still potential allergic reactions to the diazolidinyl. Nevertheless, I shall give this otherwise lovely sunscreen to a family friend, whom I am sure will LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I received this as a complimentary review product with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.ZERO of the normally expected greasiness.

    <li> Great sunscreen. Goes on nice and smooth and doesnt leave your face feeling like its caked on there. I use it before i do my makeup.</li>
    <li> After spending my youth basking in the sun, I am really trying to save my skin now. I am very fair so I have to be very careful. I wear sunscreen year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this facial sunscreen and here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The quality ingredients: Octinoxate (7.5%), Zinc Oxide (7%), Octisalate (5%). All of these are very effective at blocking the sun&#x27;s rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It blends into my skin very smoothly. I have used other sunscreens with zinc oxide and while they protected my skin, they didn&#x27;t rub in very well. I was left with a white residue. I thought that was the price I had to pay for using a product with zinc oxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* How it feels under make up. My make up just glides on my face now and the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t interfere with the consistency or color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* No smell. As much as I love the smell of sunscreen since it reminds me of summer vacations at the beach, I don&#x27;t want to walk around the office smelling like I just came from the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s not greasy. I kayak a lot and in the warm weather, my face can feel like a sweat, greasy mess. With this product, my face didn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting an effective facial sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free sample of this product for testing and review.</li>
    <li> This is very light and I love that it&#x27;s also a moisturizer. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it as a sunscreen for intense activity. It should only be for regular everyday use. (Assuming your job doesn&#x27;t require a significant time outdoors)</li>
    <li> This product contains the basic active ingredients of most sunscreen lotions.  What I like is that this contains no sweet perfumes that attract flying insects.  The lotion absorbs quickly without leaving an oily look behind.  This doesn&#x27;t cause me to sweat excessively while hiking. I use this now product while out hiking, so that my face doesn&#x27;t end up burned. (The rest of my body is covered up in clothes).  This product is sensitive enough for young children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin, so I was not worried about being allergic to this product, or having my skin burn.  I got no negative reaction to this skin.  This product comes in a long tube, which makes packing it in a day bag easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary tube in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I like it that it has no fragrance. some fragrance give me a headache. It is also light enough and doesn&#x27;t give you the oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Buy this product! This is the first moisturizer I have tried that I will continue to use. It has a light texture and is fragrance free. I have slightly oily skin and other moisturizers that I have tried (including very high-end products) have left my skin feeling overloaded so I would use a serum topped off with a foundation.  I would use this product even without the full-spectrum UVA/UVB protection which is an important big bonus.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better sunscreens for faces, because it has a silky feel, high SPF, and it&#x27;s one of the few facial products that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Filled with natural botanical elements as well as zinc, it has no scent. No waxy feel, either.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on like silk and offers a high level of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample size to test, and I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I received this newest product from COUI at a special introductory price. I have used it now for a little over a week. I have been very impressed with all the COUI products that I have purchased so far, and this product is no exception. Here is what I like about COUI sunscreen for face and body:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It glides on skin easily, is silky and leaves no excess oil or residue on skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. The product seems to just &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. It seems to be an effective sunscreen. I am fair and burn easily, and I have noticed that I can be out in the sun for hours and not have any of the pink coloring that I usually have after prolonged exposure. I do reapply twice a day, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would have to give this product 5 stars. Thanks, COUI, for producing such amazing products at such reasonable prices!</li>
    <li> Now first the good: Very absorbent, made skin soft, smelled good and was delivered a day early. The bad: It made me break out within a few days. I DO have sensitive skin. BUT within hours of requesting a refund the company had refunded me according to their guarantee and they sent me a gracious response to my complaint. With the guarantee, you can&#x27;t lose by buying this product. I give 5 stars because I think the majority of people buying this product will love it.</li>
    <li> A great sunscreen, I have been using it everyday and it is not too watery. The consistency is just right. It goes well under my makeup and it does not make my skin look extremely bright and white when I do that. It also does not &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34;/turn into white flakes. Great product.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen. It&#x27;s thick and not a watery/oily mixture that you feel with other lotions. The lotion itself is wonderful and would definitely consider buying more in the future. I&#x27;m hoping that I can catch a good sale or coupons for the product in order to be able to do so, as it is a little expensive for 4 ounces.</li>
    <li> Light and comfortable on the skin.</li>
    <li> Back in the days of using Proactiv, I got used to an oil free moisturizer. Fast forward a lot of years and I have had a really hard time finding a light oil free moisture that had enough sunscreen it, but didn&#x27;t leave a plastic or funny coating feel, and didn&#x27;t have a strong sunscreen odor. This one is the perfect mix and balance of \\&quot;not having all of those\\&quot; bad things, while having the good things! All of the ones I have identified in the mean time have since been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was given to me as a sample, and I really like it. Especially in summer months when a higher SPF is needed, this will be the lotion I choose. I&#x27;ve been through so many options with Neutrogena and other brands and they all have a sticking point-- they leave me feeling sticky, or the SPF is too low, or the sunscreen has a strong smell that stays with me all day-- all three reasons that I stopped using others. If you were a user of Biore Oil Free Moisture, which was the most recent one I was using, I think you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By a lot of patient hours, days and years of reviewing, I found myself in the top reviewers on Amazon. This wasn&#x27;t a goal or result of self promotion, but by focused reviewing. I sometimes get contacted by manufacturers or sellers who ask that I provide an unbiased review. This is one of those products. I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen, as I love all of their products. It&#x27;s great protection, yet not greasy.  Perfect beneath makeup.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, no strong odor.. It&#x27;s fall so o haven&#x27;t had as much chance to test the spf, but is something I can definitely put on my face &amp; not worry about feeling like I&#x27;m gonna break out like a teenager.</li>
    <li> Very nice SpF Suncreen. Outside on Saturday afternoons watching son play football and I can really tell my skin approves of this when the sun beats down. Skin doesnt dry out and feels refreshed and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Just started using this sunscreen about a week ago, but know already it feels great on my skin - not greasy but feels wonderful, and not heavy under light makeup.  Arrived quickly and safely and really like the follow up e-mails.</li>
    <li> Not greasy or oily and goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> i loved this, it made my skin feel silky and not  greecy like some sunscreens do!!</li>
    <li> Great item. Feels light when on</li>
    <li> This sun screen is so gentle on my skin, it feels more like a moisturizer. I love that although it has  zinc oxide, it doesn&#x27;t make me look like one of the vampires in the Twilight series. This stuff really feels great on the skin, is fragrance-free, and contains some powerful ingredients to make it 30 SPF. It can be used with all skin types. Since my skin leans more toward dry, this sunscreen feels like a two-for-one in that it feels so moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn&#x27;t Work&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Expats in Cuenca, Ecuador: The Magic &amp; the Madness&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Healing a Midlife Crisis on El Camino de Santiago&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;The Quilotoa Loop: Ecuador’s Hidden Treasure</li>
    <li> FINALLY, a sunscreen for face and body that doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell! I have been looking for a SPF 30 sunscreen just like this one forever! I like that this gives me protection and feels moisturizing. I burn very easily in the sun and I know when I put this sunscreen on I will not get a sunburn. I have very pale skin and I have avoided going outside because I could not find a good sunscreen that worked for me. This has full UVA and UVB protection, and is not grainy when rubbing onto your skin. It has a very smooth silky feel and applies to the body &amp; face amazingly, and absorbs quickly into the skin. It says on the bottle it wasn&#x27;t tested on animals and I wish more companies cared as much as this one does. This was a great price for the awesome quality and size of the bottle. It is for all skin types, and overall a terrific sun blocker.</li>
    <li> I use this as an everyday sunscreen for my face. Once you blend it in, it feels lightweight and you don&#x27;t notice it at all. It can be used under your makeup.</li>
    <li> This product is a little thicker than some face moisturizers, but it&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be rubbed in. We&#x27;ve been using it for several month, and I really like the results and the 30SPF is a huge plus. I&#x27;ll be buying many more!</li>
    <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Coui SPF 30 cream for several weeks now, and it does an excellent job as a sunscreen; however, in the beginning, I did suffer from small areas of milia from blocked pores, probably because I often used this cream before exercising outdoors.  Lately, as I&#x27;ve moved inside and used this as a daily precaution, I&#x27;ve had fewer breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the active ingredients in this cream is zinc oxide (7%), the thick white stuff my mother used to put across my face when I was a kid, but in Coui&#x27;s formulation, it disappears quickly into the skin, leaving no obvious application signs.  In fact, it gets absorbed better than other sunscreens, which can leave a sheen on the skin.  It also leaves no residual fragrance, another bonus.  And it contains antioxidants and known enhancers such as camellia, green tea extract, ginseng, gingko biloba, chamomile, licorice, and others to keep your skin healthy under the sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this isn&#x27;t waterproof, I found that it held up well even when I perspired and wiped down my face with a towel.  It&#x27;s better as a daily application than something for sports, but it works regardless.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of a moisturizer and sunscreen together. I do know the importance of protecting my skin from the damaging rays of the sun but I hardly ever remembered to apply sunscreen before this product. Now that I use this as my moisturizer I am covered.&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves a nice matt finish which is perfect for days I do not want to wear foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I have been very happy with all of the products I have been using from COUI.</li>
    <li> I was happy to try this product since I LOVE the COUI Super C Serum which I&#x27;ve been using for several months now.  I don&#x27;t typically use sunscreen as a separate lotion since it&#x27;s in the makeup I use every day.  But since this seemed like it would double as a moisturizer, I used it after the C serum and before my makeup.  it is super emollient.  But it did leave a high shine on my face which I wasn&#x27;t crazy about. I think I would definitely use it for those days when I&#x27;m outdoors and don&#x27;t care about applying makeup (at the pool or beach) but would be less likely to use it on days I&#x27;m going to work and wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> I recently recevied this product and was able to try it out at my son&#x27;s baseball tournament this weekend.  It has a nice scent and does not feel heavy or oily on my skin.  I was able to spend the whole weekend outside without any redness from the sun.  We are heading to the beach in a couple of weeks and this will definately be my sunscreen of choice for our trip.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have knowledge re SPF, but I love this COUI Moidyutixin suncreen.  It is easy to apply and not too dry.  Love it.  Thanks I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all.  Good coverage.  Has not caused any breakouts.  Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Coui Moisturizing SPF 30 Facial Sunscreen is fabulous.I absolutely love it.It has a light scent and a very nice consistency.I have oily skin and this sunscreen is not thick and heavy.It&#x27;s pretty light and absorbs into your skin quickly.I will definitely be reordering this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen goes on very smooth and does not leave a white layer of zinc as do most natural sunscreens.  Looks great under make up, and not too greasy.  Used it on my run yesterday in 80 degree weather and I did not have a problem with it getting into my eyes and stinging like most sunscreens do, and trust me, I have tried so many!  Will keep buying this and happy I finally found a great facial SPF!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works as far as I can tell. It&#x27;s not oily, it goes on easily and absorbs well. Not a bad deal that it was on sale for sampling on top of that, I think I would buy it again if it were on sale.</li>
    <li> I love this product; it&#x27;s light, absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I use it every morning after the serum but before make-up.  I did notice that it&#x27;s important to use smaller amounts with a light hand to avoid a residual white, greasy look.  It has a very light, pleasant smell, not perfumed!  COUI products are perfect for my very sensitive skin and after only a few weeks I see a definite improvement!  Thank you COUI!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this moisturizer.  It goes on a little thick but soaks in immediately.  We have tried a lot of different moisturizers and being that I don&#x27;t wash my face every night I don&#x27;t break out using this one.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen.  Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t cause breakout.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Good product. Item arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen and good for your skin!  Not sticky or greasy feeling, light and absorbs quickly.  Getting to really love this brand OUI, they have some great products and great customer service.  Will be back for more OUI products!</li>
    <li> Goes on more lightly and smoothly than similar spf 30 products. I wish it would blend in a bit more quickly, but then again, I have yet to find a spf 30 that blends in quickly enough....What&#x27;s especially nice is that unscented is truly unscented, without any funky chemical smell. It&#x27;s truly odorless.</li>
    <li> A nice light moisturizer. Unscented, so it doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin. It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky-feeling, either. Plus sunblock-excellent!&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> love how soft this moisturizer leaves my face.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well and not feeling any greasy on my face while using it. so far it protects me from sun but I seldom go outdoor. seems ok to me.</li>
    <li> Live this a lot. Moisturizing as well as a protector</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Love it!</li>
    <li> &amp;Ntilde;ot as absorbent as Ai would like! but still a very good sunscreen and moisturizer,</li>
</ol>
