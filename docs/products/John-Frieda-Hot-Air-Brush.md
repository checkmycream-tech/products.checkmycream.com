<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had several round brush hair dryers before and was hoping to find one with more power. This one has even less than the one I had before. I have medium length thick hair. After 30 minutes of drying I still had to follow up with a regular blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended to go to YouTube to search for some tutorial videos if you have never used similar product before. But, as said, as you started to use it in the right way, you will definitely fall in love with this product!</li>
    <li> Works well, does a great job.</li>
    <li> I have used hot air brushes for probably close to 20 years.  But this is my first John Frieda.  Really really wish I had discovered this brand from the beginning.  It is far above and beyond the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m not sure what is different about this one, but my hair looks worlds better and it&#x27;s much easier and quicker with this brush.  I usually shower before I sleep and go to bed with my hair wet.  I&#x27;ll wake up with my hair going crazy in 100 different directions.  It only takes me minutes to style with this brush.  Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Does not get that hot .....</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I have ever made</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!  Makes styling my hair easier and comes out beautifully!</li>
    <li> Smooths hair like a flat iron but without the damage!</li>
    <li> Not very powerful but it does help smooth your hair after you have gotten pretty much all of the moisture out.</li>
    <li> Nice unit but the handle was a little too large for my wife,s hand so I returned it for credit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a decent hot air brush for ages, and they all have disappointed me - that is until I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works so much better than the round brush + blow dryer combo when you are trying to give yourself a blow out. If this is any help - here are some tips I picked up from another person using a hot air brush -  first I let my hair air dry for 15-20 min, then use a bit of the Bumble and Bumble Thickening Spray (just on roots) or Paul Mitchell Thicken Up, then I part my hair just under the ears and clip it up on to of my head and blow out that lower area, then (with my fingers) section my hair at about the temple point, clip that up, then go around and blow out that level, then just finish with the top, starting at the back of your head and finishing with the very front.  You can hold it rolled up longer to create a flip going up or a flip going under - when you do that after having it on the warm setting, switch it to cool to set the wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a great brush and I love using it every time I want to blow out my fine, curly hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this hot air brush.  I&#x27;m not so coordinated with using a hair dryer and round brush, so this is perfect for me.  I can get a blowout that looks like I&#x27;ve been to the hair salon.  I usually blow my hair about 3/4 dry with a regular hair dryer and then use this brush. I use on high and it doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  Also, it does not tangle like another smaller heated curling brush that I once had.  Hair seems to glide through this brush. Takes just a little practice and in no time you are a pro with this hair styling tool.  Highly recommend.  Great tool for the price too!!</li>
    <li> Love this but it seemed to loose some of its blowing power after just a few uses</li>
    <li> This hot air brush is as amazing as the other reviewers have declared it to be!  The first time I used it I got absolutely stunning results, SALON blow-out results, actually.  Just make sure your hair is 95% dry.  This is my new best friend.  I agree with other reviewers, it would be nice if the switch from hot to cold was a little easier to work with.  It just takes a micro movement to move from one to the other...which is a little awkward.  But that is the only minor complaint I have.  My hair didn&#x27;t get tangled at all...</li>
    <li> Dries well, brush not so bad, but it does not leave my hair silky like this other dryer brush I had which had aluminum like bristles.  This one leaves it a little frizzy so I have to go over it with an iron.</li>
    <li> I have straight, fine, medium length hair and this is awesome. It takes me 10-15 min to blow it out and it looks like I walked out of a salon!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair perfect.  Removes all friz and flyaway.</li>
    <li> You are unable to clean easily.  Can&#x27;t was in water.</li>
    <li> Even though it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, due to other&#x27;s reviews, I thought this would work a little better.  I have thin hair, so I expected better results...but this brush did NOTHING for me.  Useless.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use even for hair dummies like me. My hair looks like it does when I leave the salon. Just make sure that your hair is not too wet when you use it or the style will not take.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, this product its probably best for fine - thin hair. And the bristles are very soft.</li>
    <li> I got this John Frieda hot air brush as an early Christmas present for myself mainly to dry my hair because I have problems with frizz if I use a regular hair dryer so I figured I would try this hot air brush instead and it has enough heat that comes from it to dry well enough I believe but it does not create unwanted frizz and it actually gives me a little more volume to my hair but I have thick, curly hair so it usually has enough volume in it but I could still tell the difference after using this hot air brush. This product seems to be a high quality product because it has a louder sound when turned on than I was expecting but at least I can tell it will work good. This hot brush sounds like a regular hair dryer to me and maybe a little louder but it is not too loud and not unbearable to stand. I am considering purchasing a few more of these as presents for other people in the future because I think this product would work well for any woman that wants dry and styled hair without the frizz.</li>
    <li> it is ok. pretty basic, nothing fancy just a normal blowdryer with brush head instead of your regular blow dryer. Was shopping for a rotating brush but I did not pay attention to the description. I also forgot that i needed it to be 220 voltage not 110 which means i should not have ordered from Amazon US, my bad.</li>
    <li> Amazing love it and recommend it 4all</li>
    <li> Best hair tool I have purchased in years!</li>
    <li> Read umpteen reviews on hot brushes and settled upon this product.  After using it fewer than twenty times, it let out a stinky hot smoke and died.  An absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> My hair has been cut and now I will take the Hot Air Brush with me and can leave the hair dryer and styler at home.  I was very impressed with how quickly it dried and styled my hair.  I would totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have had a number of hot brushes and hair dryer brushes, thinking they couldn&#x27;t be that different! I am here to tell you they are different. This hot air brush is GREAT! I have thin hair and tends to be frizzy. I have tried different &amp;#34;no frizz&amp;#34; oils and potions and nothing worked consistently. I thought maybe I should not blow dry my hair...that didn&#x27;t work well either. Then I read reviews on this John Frieda Salon Shape 1.5 inch Hot Air Brush and thought the advanced ionic technology sounded intriguing. There is 3 temp settings. Well I absolutely love this product. I have gotten complements on my hair looking healthy from my husband and others. It smoothes out the hair with no frizzies and gives it body. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair straight or wavy I love it</li>
    <li> I have used hot air brushes for years and have usually just gone to the local Wal-Mart or something when I have needed a new one.  This time I took my time and did research.  This John Frieda brush came out at the top of most of the reviews that I looked into, unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t available in any of my local stores so I turned to Amazon as the price was reasonable and it seemed that the reviews were favorable here too.  Within the first couple of times I used it, I had great results.  It is very easy to use and not awkward to handle.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled in it as others have done in the past.  I love it.  Hopefully this one will last longer then others I have purchased, but I would definitely buy another if I had to.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This design is the best I&#x27;ve seen in this type of dryer and I&#x27;ve had many of them. It&#x27;s shorter than most of this type of dryer, so is easy to hold on to and move around.  However, for me, it didn&#x27;t seem to be hot enough. But it did heat up quickly and may be sufficient for you...I am just into high heat dryers moreso.  Also, I have thin hair and the barrell is too big so all it did was straighten my hair more than it already is. It DID dry it nicely. Also, the design is a good one because it doesn&#x27;t have open \\&quot;vents\\&quot; at end of handle.  My long hair has gotten caught in those.  I am pretty sure if the barrell was smaller (I thought the size would be OK), I would&#x27;ve kept this. It&#x27;s more pro feeling than the others I&#x27;ve had. Give it a try b/c the design is just so good and manageable. This could be your best dryer if you can use a two inch barrell. I always dry my hair about halfway (or air dry it) before using this type of brush dryer, tho that isn&#x27;t necessary for all users. I just think it makes drying/styling go faster. I use mousse on wet hair and then when ready to brush dry, I use a light styling spray.  LIGHT, not hair spray or you will have nothing but stiff hair and the brush will protest!</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair, it&#x27;s also pretty long. I usually let it dry naturally but that takes all damn day. I like the look when I round brush but that takes at least an hour. So I got this thing thinking I would save some time. Just like when I round brush my hair, I wait til my hair is damp or almost dry. The tutorials on youtube make this look so easy as it glides through your hair. It doesn&#x27;t. At least it didn&#x27;t on me. I still had to section off my hair and just do little pieces at time....which still took an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if it had a thicker barrel? I have the biggest round brush they make and it glides through my hair, but this kept getting stuck. It only works with very small sections at a time. Probably works well on short hair also. It was a failed experiment. I&#x27;m going to give it to my sister who has short thin hair, I&#x27;m sure it will work for her.</li>
    <li> This product seems rather cheap (lightweight plastic), does not provide enough air flow as would want, &amp; bristles are too soft. Tried to use once received &amp; immediately knew this would not work for me. I have medium thickness hair, shoulder length/layered. I let my hair mostly dry naturally as suggested in previous reviews but just couldn&#x27;t get hair to grab in bristles without needing to touch end of device (which I knew would be very hot based on other comments).</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Leaves my hair looking as if I went to the salon. I have thin hair and it gives it a lot of volume and shine. :)</li>
    <li> The blow dry portion of this product has no power and the brush does not grab hair. Therefore, it&#x27;s just like using a regular brush on your hair and does not provide the results it promises. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I purchased this hot air brush. I will never go back to the blow dryer and brush routine again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I give this item 5 stars because it meets all the criteria I was looking for.  It was the best price, it came with Amazon free shipping and it does exactly what I bought it for.  I have thin natural curly (frizzy) hair.  This Hot Air Brush along with some leave in hair products made my thin frizzy hair smooth and much more manageable.  I use it to style after first taking out the moisture with my blow dryer for about 2 minutes.  I also use it the next day as more of a shaper and styler.  Like a hot roller with or without the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little getting use to but once you do it&#x27;s very easy. I will be buying one for my daughter who has curlier hair than I do.  She will love it!!!</li>
    <li> There are a few misfires with this product.  First off, it does not produce enough air to dry normal or thicker hair.  You need to air dry or dry your hair with a conventional hairdryer before styling with this brush.  Also, the placement of the temperature lever is awkward and requires that you remove the brush and reset the temp.  A larger barrel would also be nice.  It does, however, not get stuck in your hair when using it and that is a plus.  Overall it will do the job if you have thin hair &amp; patience.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hot air brush.  I have not used my blow dryer at all since receiving this.  It leaves my hair soft, and beautifully styled with just enough lift and wave.  Very convenient and easy to use without having to maneuver a blow dryer AND round brush, this takes all the work out of dealing with that.  I might add that I have extremely thick hair.  I was very skeptical about whether this product would even work for me, I was wrong....I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin &amp; fine so it dries fast, but if you have thick long hair, you may want to blow dry most moisture out first then use the Salon Shape to give it somebody</li>
    <li> I returned this product because it didn&#x27;t work for my thick hair. I just need more heat. Instead, I purchased the InStyler from Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, for much more money. But it has been more effective. My hair stays smooth for a long time after using it.</li>
    <li> cheap light weight plastic... I&#x27;ve only used it once and was instantly frustrated. No idea how it got so many positive reviews.  Brush doens&#x27;t hold hair well... can&#x27;t effectively use it. Argh.</li>
    <li> This is to harsh on hair</li>
    <li> Love it easy, fast and hair looks great..I was amazed the first time I used it I looked like I had just walked out of the Hair Salon...Why the Hair salons don&#x27;t use it is a mystery..Instead of using a brush in one hand and a blower in the other..I immediately bought one for my 13 year old grand daughter who has long THICK and unruly hair for her birthday next week, can&#x27;t wait for her to use it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing easy to use product! I do dry my hair with my blow dryer till its damp then this makes it smooth silky and stylish. Without taking away all the bounce.</li>
    <li> Only had it for two days, and I&#x27;m happy so far.</li>
    <li> Great round hair brush dryer. Works like a dream. Has two different heat settings as well as a cool setting. Love this product, because it makes styling my hair easy and fast.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase!  Makes the frizzies disappear without chemicals.  Makes my hair look long and silky.  Great item.</li>
    <li> I heard about this hair dryer from my sister who had one, but I could not find it at any store, so bought it on Amazon.  Much cheaper on Amazon than what she paid for hers.  I absolutely love it.  It makes hair straighter than a blow dryer and brush, it adds way more volume and gives an overall shine, and my hair is much softer.  The bristles on this air brush are a soft rubber so they do not tug and rip at hair.  It also dries hair alot faster as the air is on both sides of the brush instead of only one side when using a hair dryer.  I would definately recommend to anyone thinking of getting it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, although it is best suited for a long, smooth hairstyle (my hair is short).  Also, I was hoping it would give me some soft waves but, instead, it smoothed out my hair completely.</li>
    <li> I was truly amazed! This is the best styling gadget I have ever used.  It is easier to use thaan a blow dryer with a brush. It has never burned my neck like a curling iron.  And, it is way easier to pack than hot rollers.  I wouldn&#x27;t  be without it.</li>
    <li> I bought one Hot Air Brush and loved it so much that I bought another 3 brushes as gifts and another for travel.</li>
    <li> I have a short bob haircut. It works great for my hair and dries fast. Would recommend for short hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is very happy with it and uses it all the time.  I recommend this product, because it is most likely going to be exactly what you expect it to be!</li>
    <li> it was not what I was ythink at first. I thought that the brush rotates.&lt;br /&gt;After some tempts , I am get right with it...</li>
    <li> Easy to use and hold but my fingers aren&#x27;t as short as some women.  Soft bristles and variety of temps are appreciated.  Wish John Frieda also made one with a smaller barrel width.</li>
    <li> I like how this brush grips my hair and I can use it with one hand.  It styles my hair nicely and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a while now,  I&#x27;ve not found another product like it on the net.  It&#x27;s drying power is very good, but don&#x27;t expect it to blast your hair dry.  The hot setting is plenty hot to dry your hair quickly.  By pushing the button all the way up you can change to a cool air blast to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; a large curl.  My hair is thin and fine, so takes no time to dry. If your hair is long and thick, I would imagine that it would require considerable time to dry if you only used this product.  Likely you would use another dryer to pre dry to a point and then use this one with the ionization ability to finish.  Leaves my hair soft but not frizzy.  Appears to be very durable and the no tangle cord is a plus. The bristles never catch or pull my hair and I have absolutely no problem using this product.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> great styler drying ...hair really shines using this one ...no burn</li>
    <li> this product does not work in singapore.</li>
    <li> Works as described, but takes really long for long hair.</li>
    <li> I use this EVERY DAY! I used to use a blow dryer, then my N Styler to smooth my ends, then a curling brush to add a little extra curl and a straightner to smooth my bangs out.  This one piece replaced them ALL!!!  It NEVER tangles!!!!  I can push these soft bristles all the way to my root, lift and curl it under and it never ever tangles! I have very fine, thin, silky hair that tangles very easily and this never does. it adds tremendous body, shine, volume, and CURL to my hair.</li>
    <li> Blow drying has never been easier. Easy to use and travel with. Saves money since I don&#x27;t have to go the salon to get my hair blown out. I was skeptical of this product at first but was pleasantly surprised after using. Thinking about buying some as gifts this holiday season too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work too well for me. My hair is starting to thin and the hard bristles hurt my scalp.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I returned. It does not produce enough power to evenly smooth hair. I used this to dry my hair when it was already 80% dry. As you should, because trying to use a tool like this with sopping wet hair would take a century. It failed to produce an even blowout.  I even tried it when my hair was completely dry to see if I could just use it to &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; my look and it did not give me a smooth even look like I was hoping for. I won&#x27;t switch to this from using a nozzle blow dryer and ceramic round brush. Now, I&#x27;m a stylist. I desire results many don&#x27;t. Give it a try if round brushing is too difficult for yourself, it may work! The design is great. It&#x27;s only the power that lacks.</li>
    <li> Love it, but I wish the High Heat setting was a little hotter.</li>
    <li> THIS HAS BEEN A PLEASANT SURPRISE.  THE BRISTLES ARE GOOD AND IT REALLY SMOOTHS YOUR HAIR AND MAKES IT SHINE.  IT HAS 3 SPEEDS OF LOW, HIGH, AND THEN COLD.  THIS IS GREAT TO FINALLY SET THE STRANDS OR TO HELP WITH FLY AWAYS.  QUIET RUNNING AND NOT TO HEAVY.  MUCH EASIER FOR ME THAN USING A BRUSH AND BLOW DRYER.  NICE LONG CORD TOO.</li>
    <li> Produce was mostly what I  thought I was looking for.I was under the assumption that the brush rotated, but I still love it and works great in my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased bc I was curious how a brush drier would work on my hair (thick yet fine chin length bob-style).  I&#x27;m not really into the trendy flat iron look that&#x27;s time should have expired by now, but a classic soft look.  This iron is great in achieving this.  Even when my hair is dry and needs a touch up late in the day, it is ideal.  Here&#x27;s to hoping it is a durable and well made product that will last.</li>
    <li> Great hot air brush! I have  used many brands over the yearsand like this one the best. Works well on my fine hair. Has just enough power, not too hot to burn.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair but it is fine and needs humidity for the curl to look it&#x27;s best. I hate the time it takes to blow dry my hair straight with a round brush. When I saw this product I thought there is no way this styling brush could actually work. Let me tell you - it does really work. My stylist suggested I wash my hair at night and put a straightening creme in it after it&#x27;s towel dried. I go to bed with it wet and wake up with my hair 95% dry. I spritz in some leave in conditioner and add a small amount of heat protectant straightening creme, then use the air brush. I section my shoulder length hair, styling one section at a time, making it easier to manage. It literally takes 10 minutes for all this! The first time I used it I got so many compliments and one of my coworkers went out that very afternoon to buy a styling brush! I watched the video one reviewer put on here and watched other YouTube tutorials. Yes, the dryer part of the brush isn&#x27;t very forceful, but it is definitely hot. I gingerly hold the end of the brush as I am using it. Totally love that this cuts my styling time in half. I wish I had discovered this product years ago. You will not be disappointed! If you are unsure about buying it online, Ulta Cosmetic stores carry it and with a coupon it ends up being the same price.</li>
    <li> My hair used to be curly and I never had to use a dryer of any kind.  If I wore it curly all I had to do was wash and let it dry naturally.  When I wanted a straighter look I followed the \\&quot;Spanish\\&quot; method.  It takes a long time to dry but the results are wonderful.  Over time my hair has straightened somewhat and I still use the \\&quot;Spanish\\&quot; method but when I haven&#x27;t time I use the John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush.  I really like it.  My hair is shiny and smooth when finished and the brush is very gentle on my hair.  The \\&quot;Spanish\\&quot; method: Wash hair as usual, take a large amount of hair from the crown of one&#x27;s head and comb it straight and roll it over the largest roller you can buy, clip it in place. All the remaining hair is then combed around your head until smooth (head is acting as a huge roller), clip in place, cover with a sturdy hair net and sleep on it. You will be delighted with the results but you do need time for it to dry.</li>
    <li> I was out shopping for a brush that I can use to freshen up my hair without having to blow it out.  And this is the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it NOT Damaging, but gives you volume and shine.  And it is light enough to carry on short trips.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!  Plus you can use it everyday!</li>
    <li> The perfect temperature and the best bristles--soft and smooth touch on the scalp!!  Finally a well designed and efficient hot hair brush (John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush) that neither burn your scalp nor damage your hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy Asian hair that gets big with any humidity.  Only the Brazilian blowout has helped control the volume in my hair.  Not wanting to undergo the chemical exposure I wanted to find another method to tame my hair.  Flat-ironing is extremely damaging to my hair, but I needed something with heat to smooth the cuticle. I have a hard time blowing out my hair using a brush and a blow dryer, so my hair dresser suggested I try a hot air brush.  The John Frieda hot air brush straightens my hair and overall I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  There are, however, significant flaws:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The base should have some sort of textured grip.  When using styling products in trying to style my hair, my hands get slippery and it&#x27;s difficult to get a firm grip sometimes.  I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times, but fortunately it&#x27;s still working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The controls are difficult to slide.  You cannot use one hand to change from low to high or to cool.  This is the most severe design flaw.  It is extremely difficult to give your hair a blast a cool air to set it using only one hand while you&#x27;re in the middle of styling your hair.  If it weren&#x27;t for this I would have rated this air brush higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this one breaks down, I would think twice before I would purchase it again for these reasons.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to a regular blow dryer again! My hair is thick, coarse and wavy and very stubborn. This tames my frizz and leaves my hair amazingly soft. The only tip I&#x27;ve learner is this is best to use on semi-dry hair, not soaking wet and heavy. It flattened the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> good value for money!!</li>
    <li> Bought this Hot Air Brush for my daughter but think I have used it more.  It is very easy to use with great results.</li>
    <li> This product has made a huge difference in my hair.  I have extremely fine, but curly hair and I usually dry it every morning with a round brush and a regular blow dryer.  The result is often frizzy and dry looking but I needed to do this to get volume and to pull out the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use this dryer every morning and my hair is shiny, bouncy and healthy looking and the frizz is almost completely gone.  It is a great product and I love it.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like it is damaging my hair either!  It does take a little longer to dry so I usually just blow with my old dryer a bit first, and then switch to this, but that works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, at the end of the day if my hair is messy or has been ruined by the weather, it only takes a minute to fix it again using this dryer.  Great results!</li>
    <li> I swim frequently and wash my hair every time afterward.  By the time I get home my hair is drying and I can use this brush to put a little lift in and go on with my day.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have fine medium length hair and it was always problematic when blow drying my hair - I could never do the back right with the brush and the dryer at the same time.  This tool is lightweight and relatively quiet compared to a hair dryer and does the job quite nicely.  Great for travel too!!  I would recommend this and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  I bought it to replace an older Conair version and I like like this one so much better.  I have thick, a little longer than shoulder length, wavy hair - not curly, not straight.  Using this hot air brush makes my hair straight and smooth and it works SO much better than the old Conair versions!!!</li>
    <li> love this - no need for round brushing</li>
    <li> I loved my old Vigo, which died, and is not being made any more.  I have extremely curly/hard to manage hair, and this is the best replacement I have found (have tried many others).  Although it is only 500W, it does an extremely efficient job, and the size of the barrel is perfect for straightening (with a little help from a flat iron to bring it down).</li>
    <li> I have used this brush for a few weeks.  The size of the handle provides a good grip. The brush gripes the hair firmly but does not get tangled. I would prefer that the brush was a inch longer.  I dislike the brush because the control switch is so tight that I can not turn the brush on with my finger (i.e. push down and push up).  Instead I need to use my finger nail to wedge under the bottom of the switch and push the switch to the on position.  Once turned &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; I can move the switch to one of the optional settings.  I have repeatedly moved the switch trying to &amp;#34;break it in&amp;#34; with no success.  If the control switch was easier to use I would give this brush a rating of 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Blowdrying my hair can take an hour with a traditional blow dryer and brush, hence I never did it.  It was always a treat to have my hair done at the salon but I was never able to recreate the look at home. My stylist suggested getting a hot air brush. I had one once with stiff bristles (like the ones on ionic brushes) and I didn&#x27;t like it - my hair tangled easily in it and I found it difficult to use. I figured I would try again and that&#x27;s when I found this one.  I like that the bristles are both &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and plastic. It holds the hair well without tangling and leaves hair shiny. It&#x27;s lightweight and just hot enough. I am still surprised at how easy it is to use and the results are great! I do recommend using when hair is partly dry and for this I still use my blowdryer. Overall, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I love this hot brush. I have used others but none did as well giving volume to my fine thin hair as this brush. I have purchased one for both my daughters.</li>
    <li> It will work better for short hair.</li>
    <li> Great hair brush.  A must have!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and I am hair challenged.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick so I was not able to replace this with my blow dryer...however works great when you need to finish up your hair.</li>
    <li> Too hard to use got stuck in my hair</li>
    <li> Love the John Frieda Hot Air Brush. I have had it for a over a year now.  I have thin, fine hair and usually let it dry naturally and would use a hair dryer and brush to style it while it was slightly damp.  It&#x27;s so much easier to do my hair now with the hot air brush. It does not have as much power as a hair dryer but it does the job and makes it actually fun to style my hair.  I like having a free hand to help with the styling.  I used to put my hair up more often because I hated trying to style my hair but with this product I don&#x27;t mind doing it and wear my hair down more.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> After searching the beauty supply stores in my area, I was pleased to find this hot brush at Amazon. The best features are the fact that you can touch it and not get burned and it does not get tangled in your hair. It works equally well in my shoulder length, fine hair, and my niece&#x27;s long, thick hair. Overall, a great product that costs much less than similar products.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Highly recommend. Even gives my fine chemically processed blonde hair a smooth salon finish with body. Amazing. Goodbye curlers and blowdryer!</li>
    <li> great for touch-ups and giving my hair volume.  It&#x27;s hard to use a hairdryer and round brush at the same time and this fixes that problem.  it is not as strong as a regular blow dryer, so I find it works great if I dry my hair partway, first!  This has a nice shape that is so easy to handle!</li>
    <li> Takes forever to dry hair</li>
    <li> I just got this the other day. In the instructions it says to get your hair to about 80% dry before using this. So I had to blow it dry for awhile, mostly at the roots, then I started with this. It is pretty cool. It saves having to use two hands and your arms all up in the air for the whole time you have to dry you hair, which for me is at least a half an hour. I have waist length slightly layered hair that dries to slightly wavy. As it dries normally it goes through a super frizzy looking stage. Because it takes so long to dry, I usually let it air dry. If I wanted to blow it straight at home it would take forever and just be too much. I liked this because it has hot low speed, hot high speed and then cool high speed. It really gave me that blown out look with a lot less effort. When I wanted to put a bit of a curl on it, I could blow it at hot then cool it off and then take it out of the hair. It cut the time down and looked like I spent a lot longer. I am going to have to work on it getting to curl more and maybe use some heat safe hair product. It gets hot. It has the soft and harder brush teeth on it, so its like two brushes and a dryer in one. I really like it. My hair is really soft, super nice feeling with a lot less effort. It&#x27;s as close as I have gotten to the fresh from the salon feel on my own. The brush dryer itself seems pretty sturdy, and easy to use and access the control switch as you are using it. The shape makes it like you are just brushing your hair. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped on time. It is best to dry your hair with a towel first and either air dry  or blow dry at your discretion..then use the hot air brush. I don&#x27;t think it was created to dry wet hair like a blow dryer</li>
    <li> Works great. It has a lot of drying power compared to the last dryer brush I had which was a conair. I have had no problem with the brush getting tangled in my hair. It works great. I have long hair and it takes me a little over 10 minutes to dry it with this brush. It also does a decent job with my short bangs. It&#x27;s very easy to use, I am generally very lazy/washing go, and I have continued to use it for about a month now.</li>
    <li> I love the idea, but I&#x27;m used to a turbo 1500 so this product doesn&#x27;t work for me. If you have curly hair don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Better on wet hair then dry. Fast and easy!</li>
    <li> Love the volume and shine this gave my hair.</li>
    <li> I wish it had a stronger motor but it still does the job well. I have very curly hair so I still need to use a flat iron after if I want it super straight but it&#x27;s easier to blow dry than using a brush/hair dryer combo.</li>
    <li> This styler works great I have to say the same as everyone else the gets super hot and you  can&#x27;t hold on to it or you will burn yourself.</li>
    <li> 7 months to the day and it burned out! I bought it may 6! I loved it right up until today. it&#x27;s sad that it didn&#x27;t even make it to a year. I would give it a better review because it was wonderful to use. I like the 1.5 barrel size and the fact that it makes my hair look professionally blow dried, without having to use a brush and blow dryer, which totally kills both arms.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sitting on a shelf.  Didn&#x27;t return as too much of a hassle, but don&#x27;t waste your money on this unless you have fine hair that dries and styles easily on &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; setting.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as expected.  My good old Conair shaper was much better and lasted for years!  Not worth the money.  Doesn&#x27;t produce the same soft curl like my Conair shaper.</li>
    <li> Great idea...just not perfect.  Pros: good idea, bristles hold the hair well, and low and high setting.  Cons: only 500 watts (my normal hairdryer is 2100 watts), takes FOREVER TO DRY YOUR HAIR, no cool touch tip at the end so if you touch the end of the roller, OUCH, you will get burned.  So all in all not a horrible product, just not good either. I got great volume out of but with low power like 500 Watts you&#x27;ll spend way more time doing your hair than you will showing it off. This product might work on very short Halle Berry length hair, but anything past your ears, prepare to add some extra time to your schedule (+30 to 1 hr extra) to use this. I have a lot of fine but curly hair a little past my shoulders and normal drying time is 30 minutes for me and another 10 minutes if I touch it up with the flat iron. Using this product it took 1 hr and 15 minutes to dry and curl it, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as straight as when you blow dry it with a roller brush. I still had kinks in it. I tried to use the flat iron after to touch it up but my roots were still somewhat curly and weird. Not a good look.  I ended up buying the Revlon titanium hot air styler with 1200 watts instead and wow what a difference. Now I&#x27;ve got a couple of improvements for Revlon too, it&#x27;s not perfect either, but certainly deserves more stars than John Frieda simply due to the huge increase in power which makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Thick and heavy with very weak air flow. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> It is not hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> I  purchased this product a few weeks ago and I have been trying to use it. It works great at the maximum heat temperature but for some reason my hair will look smooth and styled for a little while but an hour later it becomes frizzy. Perhaps the summer weather and my thick, wavy Indian hair has something to do with this. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to someone with high-maintenance hair like mine.</li>
    <li> It gets very hot even though some comments say it&#x27;s not. It works great and it&#x27;s fast. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before I moved to America from England so bought a US voltage one when I got here. The US one has a few differences to the UK one though. With this one, when you turn down the heat setting, the temperature stays the same, there is just less blowing. Not as good as the UK one, when you turn that down the volume of air coming through remains the same but the temperature is cooler - obviously what you would expect on a lower heat setting. Another disadvantage is that you can&#x27;t remove the brush to clean or wash it - not good. However, a hot air brush is the only way I have ever been able to blow dry my shortish fine hair and get it to look smooth, silky and full of body!</li>
    <li> Love this couldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> Can use with arthritic shoulders as it is lightweight.</li>
    <li> Never expected it to be so good and convenient! according to its price it worth every penny</li>
    <li> Love it. Easy to use. Hair comes out great.</li>
    <li> I wish the low setting was slightly more powerful.  The difference between low and high is too wide.  I do love to use it, just takes longer than I had hoped.</li>
    <li> its only 500 watts, my blow dryer is 1800.  Takes 3 times as long to dry. I will continue using my round brush and hair dryer</li>
    <li> This just arrived. It is wonderful. I styled my hair without wetting it, and it looks really good (it was looking like I should not be seen in public).  I&#x27;ve used this type of dryer/styler for 15+/- years, but the company that made them downgraded the wattage to 250 which will not dry or style my hair in an amount of time that is workable (It takes hours with the low wattage other brands have now). I have searched and searched and tried many stylers. I was very excited when I saw this one. It is great!  This is like my old one: amazing.   Details:  The heat is good  The brush holds my hair for drying and styling but doesn&#x27;t pull it out :):):)  The weight is fine  The larger handle is no problem for me and I have tiny hands  Off to the post office but   I will be lighting a candle for peace at 6pm</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and heard that this iron was good for that! Love it and keeps my hair looking healthy!</li>
    <li> I should have got this a long time ago, was afraid it would not work well on short hair because the handle is pretty big, but it is AWESOME, love this product. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I found this product in the UK and was over the moon when I found it on Amazon.....it is a great Hot Air Brush, especially for curly hair. My hair is smooth and shiny......[[ASIN:B0056GDG90 John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase. I still blow dry my hair and I set it by using the salon shape to eliminate frizz and give my layers volume curl. Better than curling iron for me.</li>
    <li> This is so much easier than using a round brush &amp; hairdryer.  However you still have to rough dry with a brush or it will take forever to dry your hair.  Wish that one with a one-inch barrel was available, however, makes my life easier.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend!  Agree that the switch is a bit awkward.  Easy to learn to use, does not tangle... makes my hair look great, I can duplicate what my hairstylist does... never thought my hair could look this good everyday... :)</li>
    <li> two problems:  the removable end which allows you to clean the filter keeps coming off during use.  the switch is hard to turn to the right level to the extent that you have to turn it on before you wind it in the hair.  otherwise, works well.  still, some hassle involved.</li>
    <li> I used this hot air brush a maximum of 4 times before it stopped working and started to smoke. Don&#x27;t buy this product. It never gets hot enough to dry your hair, especially if you have thick or long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Very unhappy,&lt;br /&gt;Connie</li>
    <li> Great for thick coarse hair</li>
    <li> Pay attention: this brush did not turn around!</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Yes it works great! Especially for long hair this is my 2nd one too!</li>
    <li> I like the size of this brush, but like others I&#x27;ve tried before my hair gets caught in the seam between the heated brush and the handle - what&#x27;s up that? If anyone knows of a brush that does not do that hit me up ... other than the pain and anguish of having my hair pulled out I still use it often, it&#x27;s holding up well and besides a few small bald patches my hair looks pretty rockin&#x27; every day.</li>
    <li> I found this to be easy to use although it doesn&#x27;t really eliminate a step for me; I used my regular blow dryer until my hair was 80-85% dry then used this as a styling tool in place of the usual round brush.  My hair is collar length and fine so I had no problem with the brush.  At 1.5: it is a larger brush than I was using so there is no curl, just a little more body at the roots.  One word of caution though, the product I received was clearly used and repackaged.  (I had to clean gray hair out of the brush prior to using it.) I recommend the product but not the seller.</li>
    <li> This tool is great for people that can&#x27;t master the blow dryer and round brush maneuver.  It helps to smooth out your hair and give it a little volume.  Surprisingly, it does not get caught in the hair.</li>
    <li> My hair has gone from straight with no wave to some wave and then to curls and now its a frizzy mess. I enjoyed a 3-4 year period of \\&quot;just right\\&quot; - plenty of body, some curl, and easy to style.  A flat iron left my ends looking weird and it took too my time.  I ordered this in desperation and I&#x27;m SO GLAD I did.  I use a regular dryer on the coolest level to get the hair at least 50% dry. Then I finish with the hot air brush and my hair looks like it did during the \\&quot;just right\\&quot; years.  PLUS, I tried it on dry hair and it worked! I couldn&#x27;t believe how much frizz was gone.  I agree w/ many others regarding the button - if it were just a little fatter, it would be much easier.</li>
    <li> Does not get HOT enough</li>
    <li> I love it!  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would really go through my thick, long hair but needed to do something!  A friend told me about this so i looked at it carefully, read the reviews and decided to try it!  it works so well.  it didn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair (although I had it straightened before Christmas it is still thick, somewhat curly and still has a tiny bit of frizz.  I am Caucasian but as I have gotten older my hair has gotten curlier and frizzier.  I just turned 65 and it was getting so unruly.)  Using this was like putting in a large hot roller but with a handle and running it through my hair to the end and then I just turned the barrel a bit until it caught the ends and began rolling upwards, catching all the hair in it as though it was a roller.  i held it there a very short time (should have done longer to give it a little more curl on ends but I didn&#x27;t have time so went with the straight look) and unrolled it.  i did it in huge chunks of hair and it only took 14 minutes to go through all my hair like that.  it held throughout the day well too.  no frizz at end of day.  when the straightener wears off i think I could still use this product to quickly straighten and de-frizz it a bit at end of day if we are going out that night.  I have problem hair and nothing can change that, but this is a huge help!  I love the big barrel also to hold onto it.  little handles are hard to hold for very long!</li>
    <li> I had originally bought this tool thinking that it could replace my hair dryer. Nope. It doesn&#x27;t generate enough air to do that with my pretty thick hair. BUT, once I figured out that it was more of a styling tool, I decided to keep it. I use it when my hair is 75% dry to style it, smooth it and finish the job. Used that way, I really like what it does.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Difficult to use on yourself. I thought it would help straighten hair and leave silky, not the case.  When I do my daughter&#x27;s hair I have more control</li>
    <li> I had my doubts when reading the descriptions of this product online at amazon and elsewhere. It just seemed that it really wasn&#x27;t clear what this \\&quot;hot air\\&quot; brush would do (increase volume, shine. Hmm. OK.). Should have heeded my instincts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews before ordering so I was aware that given its low wattage this is not meant to be used as a \\&quot;real\\&quot; dryer if you have long and/or thick hair. So I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to function as a dryer on my long (collar), medium-thick wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I did expect that I could straighten and style damp hair given its description as a \\&quot;hot air\\&quot; brush. However, this hot air brush didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my hair--definitely no volume and no shine. Took several minutes (a lot longer than using regular hair dryer and brush!) to get small sections of hair straight and dry and though my hair is easily styled/set with curling irons, this brush did not add any body or shape. VERY disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only thing it is good for? Spot drying and straightening damp sections of hair at nape, neckline, etc. after a shower or bath before then going on to actually style hair with electric rollers and/or curling iron. At this price, that&#x27;s an expensive product option since one could easily do the same with any cheap hair dryer and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is wavy rather than tight curly but I found that this brush was not very effective in straightening hair or adding \\&quot;body\\&quot; though I tried it on hair that was different degrees of damp. (And yes, I followed the instructions, which suggest that you use when your hair is \\&quot;80% dry\\&quot; and I did turn my hair upside down and blow/brush out from the roots.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for making my hair less static? Could not discern any noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only seeming plus: It did not seem to dry hair out as much as when using a traditional hair dryer and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used it quite a bit in initial two weeks I did not feel comfortable returning it, but I wish I had. Total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given some of the other newer comments, it seems that no matter what length your hair is, others have experienced similar problems and disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the folks at John Frieda hair care products, I hope you read these comments and do something to improve the product. I love your actual hair care products and use them daily so my expectation level for the performance of this product was high based on prior positive experience.newer comments, it seems that no matter what length your hair is, others have experienced similar problems and disappointment.

    <li> My Wigo hot air brush has given up the ghost, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be carried by anyone any longer. I searched for possible alternatives for my shoulder length defiantly STRAIGHT layered hair, and found the same old products, which I have tried and am not impressed with. Instead, I found this new hot air brush by John Frieda, and it is WONDERFUL. I received it 3 days ago, and I am truly enjoying using it. The picture doesn&#x27;t really show this, but it has two types of bristles; one is longer, stiffer and has rounded ends, and a short set of normal softer bristles. This brush head really grabs my hair and guides it around the brush - no more slithering out of the brush head, and burned fingers from trying to guide my hair around the brush. It doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair, releases easily, and I am not ending up with any fuzzy, kinked ends from not having wrapped my hair around the brush properly before setting the curl. The high heat setting isn&#x27;t too hot, so it doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp, and it has a cool setting (that is a little bit hard to find) that helps set the curl. It does have a little seam in the housing that caught my hair initially and pulled out a few hairs - I think I might seal that with epoxy, and I would love it if this brush came in a 1 1/4 inch barrel size. My hair looks like my hairdresser blow dried it after using this product - even in the back - and the curl and body last all day!! I am buying another as a spare/travel hot air brush.</li>
    <li> I bought the John Frieda Hot Air Brush after I already had the similar 2\\&quot; Conair rotating brush.  I&#x27;ll make this simple, if you are comparing these 2 for a purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Both are good quality and are similar in style and girth.  Both are wide and can be cumbersome to hold, especially if you have small hands. With that said, Conair&#x27;s dryer is easier because it spins and hair easily attaches to the barrel. Note: it can tangle the hair if too much is caught.&lt;br /&gt;2) I do not use either to physically dry my hair, only style.  I blow-dry my hair to 90% dry with a traditional dryer first. Using this product to dry your hair (unless it was short or very fine) would take a ridiculous amount of time to dry. Don&#x27;t waste your time unless this is the only dryer you have and you&#x27;re in a \\&quot;hurry\\&quot;... otherwise, wait for it to air-dry or use a traditional hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;3) The Conair rotates which creates a tremendously smooth finish with minimal effort since it does the majority of the work.&lt;br /&gt;4) John F.&#x27;s 1.5\\&quot; barrel size is perfect for my top layers (my hair is long with shorter layers on top) and using it I can create incredible volume at the root, almost magical.&lt;br /&gt;5) John F.&#x27;s cool setting is much better than Conair&#x27;s which I can barely detect. Note: Conair&#x27;s product will not spin in the cool setting, which is a bummer IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if John F.&#x27;s product had the ability to spin, it would be my go-to choice, hands down. John F, please enhance this dryer so it spins, then it&#x27;s a total win!</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Thought it would help with frizz a bit more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to freshen my bob after sleeping.  Finally found one that works easily. I don&#x27;t even have to section.  Just start turning at the nape of my neck, and slowly travel up. A quick turn around my face, and I&#x27;m done.  It also smooths and shines my hair and makes it look freshly shampooed.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do. It does dry and take most of the frizz out of your hair as it is drying it. Great product. I would recommend it to ANYONE who wants healthy hair with minimal heat being applied to it. Thanks</li>
    <li> This hot air brush is amazing. I am not coordinated enough to use a round brush like at the salon and now I don&#x27;t need too. I get the sane results without the hassle. Hair doesn&#x27;t even tangle in the brush. I love it!</li>
    <li> The best $40 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time. I have thin, fine hair cut into a layered chin length bob. I&#x27;ve never been able to get the hang of a round brush and blow dryer, so I used to style my hair with a variety of tools and it took forever. Now this is the only styler on my bathroom counter! When used with a good spray mousse, it gets close enough to the scalp to build volume at the root -- without burning your skin. I&#x27;m not sure it would be the best choice for very thick, coarse, or long hair, but if you have a fine bob, the John Frieda is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this and it works great on her long straight hair, to smooth it out.  Unfortunately the motor burns out.  The first one broke after about 6 months and the second one broke after 4 months.</li>
    <li> I tried many 1.5 inch barrel hair dryers and this is by far the best one.  It holds my hair and is easy to use. My hair is much silkier and smoother - no more frizziness when drying on high heat.  Love this hair dryer and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This styled was just what I was looking for. It is easy to use, leaves your hair smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I dont know if after a few uses, the tools loses it&#x27;s \\&quot;ooomph\\&quot;, but now, after about 10 uses, i notice that i still have waves in my hair after repeated styling of sections.  I think it is a great idea, but would not purchase again unless improvements could b made - perhaps more heat???</li>
    <li> Great tool for smoothing hair and creating volume just where you want it. The cooling feature helps lock in body! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much since I got it, but I&#x27;ve got no complaints. My hair is super fine so it doesn&#x27;t behave well. My body&#x27;s still working through to the anti-cancer after drug-hair takes a beating! This helps me provide body and allows me to control the curl/wave.</li>
    <li> Loved it, better than I expected</li>
    <li> Daughter LOVES this.  Says it cuts down the time to do her hair at least by 50%</li>
    <li> I love this brush dryer.  My hair is thick, wavy, and tends to frizz but after drying my hair with this product I look like I had a salon blow out.  It lasts longer than my usual home styling, too, and it is fast and easy to use.  I highly recommend blow drying your hair 80% dry on low setting with a standard dryer first and then use this dryer to style, smooth, and curl.  I also use it at the root to give some lift, just be sure to keep the dryer at the roots and lift and this will give lots of movement to your hair.</li>
    <li> This is a good styler to finish off my hair style.  I usually use my regular blow dryer and round brush and get my hair about 80 percent dry, then add body and smoothness with the hot air brush.  Makes my hair look professionally blown out, and I can go a little longer between haircuts.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This does a much better job than the rotating brush I bought a few weeks ago.  I recommend it&lt;br /&gt;to anyone who has short to medium-length hair.  It adds volume and shape.  I touch it up with&lt;br /&gt;an iron right after blowing dry, but this would be optional.  Decent value.</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine hair, shoulder length, and this is perfect.  I used to blow dry with a round brush then curl it with a curling iron.  This does everything in one step and my hair looks so shiny and so much better than before!  It is also lightweight and the bristles are soft but catch my flyaway hair with no problem.  I like the small size of it too, nice for travel.  I also purchased the Conair SD4P Unisex Hair 1875-Watt Styler with Three Attachments, this was way too hot for my hair and scalp.  The John Frieda hot air brush has the perfect heat for fine hair.  Probably would need to blowdry a little first if you have super thick hair or usually need a high heat dryer.</li>
    <li> This brush is no good to me. There&#x27;s barely any hot air. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get my hair straight.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have ever used on my hair! I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to fuss with my hair that is more curly in some spots, and less in others. This makes it quick and easy, and it actually does what it says it does!!! It&#x27;s just that good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month&#x27;s time and while it worked great, now it does&#x27;t work at all…. No idea what happened, but nothing happens when I turn it on. Resetting it doesn&#x27;t fix the issue either. I didn&#x27;t even use it every day, just a couple times a week. I&#x27;m not sure what to do about it now because OF COURSE it decided to go kaput right after I am unable to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while it works, it&#x27;s great! However, it doesn&#x27;t last very long...</li>
    <li> This gives my hair a smooth finished look without a ton of work. It takes me maybe 10 minutes to do my hair with this and it looks salon blown out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Hot Air Brush a few months ago and wanted to test it&#x27;s performance for a while before writing a review.  I was somewhat skeptical, having used other hot air brushes in the past that I was not happy with.  I must say I am very happy with this product.  I have chin length fine texured hair with a lot of volume.  It always took me so long to dry my hair.  I am amazed at how quickly this does the job and I only ever use the low and cool settings.  The volume it gives my stick straight hair is great and lasts through the day and night.  I wish the barrel was a little smaller, but I simply use a curling iron to give a little more definition to the ends, but I would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Tried this for the first time today, and wow, is it great. Way better than the conair unit I had been using. Much more powerful airflow and bristles that actually work, instead of collapsing because they&#x27;re too soft. A+ so far.</li>
    <li> If you have thick wavy hair this won&#x27;t really work. Its very low powered.</li>
    <li> My hair is slightly wavy, resulting in lots of kinks that I don&#x27;t want.  After using this my hair is shiny, and styles so much better.  It took a little getting used to this after using a traditional brush and hair dryer, it works better if you let it dry about 50% before using.</li>
    <li> Works well on medium or short hair. Tangles when you try to get lift at the roots.</li>
    <li> After the third use, the wand made a funny noise, and stopped working altogether. They sent me a replacement but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush and was so impressed with the results. I have tried so many air brushes in the past and wondered if this one was any different. I finally decided to give it a try. The brushes I had were not recent, so I took the plunge and tried a recent improved edition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, it worked just as advertised! My thin hair had more volume, shine and less frizz. I never had a problem with any frizz until I hit my late fifties. Then, my hair texture changed. This product really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush holds securely, all the hair...and is very easy to style. The shine was truly noticeable. I generally blow dry my hair gently before I use the brush. Then, I begin using the John Frieda Brush. It is lightweight and easily maneuverable.  It is also much more travel friendly. Easily fits in my purse or carry on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, thank you for such quick delivery, as usual. I also found that your price was really quite competitive, plus, free shipping.</li>
    <li> where have you been all my life?  makes my hair soft and shiny.  dries it really fast if you do small sections.  love everything about it.</li>
    <li> I have wanted one for quite some time so decided to take the plunge. It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and I LOVE it! Dries my hair in half the time it usually takes. It does what the product description states.. dries and styles all at once. I&#x27;m quite happy and glad I treated myself. If you have the means to buy one I say, do it.</li>
    <li> I really found that I like this product. My hair is thin and I think it works really well to flip up the ends. You really do have to have your hair atleast 50% dry though, or it would take forever, I am happy with the results it gives me.</li>
    <li> I like this hot air brush very much.  I have fine hair.  I use the HOT setting to create a curl or wave, and then switch to the COOL setting to &#x27;lock it in.&#x27; It has a good combination of soft bristles and harder plastic bristles, so that it will move through your hair, but also catch hold of your hair for styling.  I bought a different model recently, and it had entirely soft bristles, and was impossible to use. The only warning:  this is the 2nd one of these I have bought.  The first lasted about 6 months.  Maybe that was a fluke, or maybe they don&#x27;t last too long.  I&#x27;ll let you know if this one stops working. May 2016 - it&#x27;s been quite a while, and I realized that I should update this review since this last brush I bought is still working fine, and it&#x27;s been almost 18 months.</li>
    <li> Better for shoulder length thin hair. Doesn&#x27;t work as good as my revlon hot air curling brush.</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer! It does wonders fory hair. I&#x27;m very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> This hot air brush has changed my life! I still don&#x27;t believe how great my hair looks. I&#x27;ve finally got control of that annoying little wave that has plagued me all my life.The cool setting is perfect for a quick touch-up.</li>
    <li> ive been looking for a brush for the longest, i had borrowed my sisters, she has a rotating one and i absolutely hated it. my hair kept getting caught, i figured id try the john freida one and let me tell you i absolutely love it. it has cut down the straightening process to 15 minutes, the only con is your hair has to be dry otherwise its going to take forever, the voltage is not high but i prefer it this way cause it doesnt burn my hair</li>
    <li> This is a great styler!  First time using it out of the box and I had shiny, smooth AND styled hair.  I would highly recommend this.  It took just minutes to use.  My hair was damp, and I tousle dried the wet parts with a hair dryer, but then took small sections of damp hair and the shine was incredible and only took minutes!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I usually have trouble blending my side bangs with a regular hair dryer and brush, but this worked great on the bangs and blended perfectly!  I will be ordering another one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> It works better than I thought it would and for the price! But I have curly hair and I also have to use my flat iron to get to my hair close to my roots straight. Other than that it&#x27;s a good hair tool</li>
    <li> This little brush does everything it claims.  I love it and hate it that I didn&#x27;t buy one way before this.  I have long, naturally curly hair this lovely brush smooths out and my hair just gleams!  As long as this product is made, I will keep one around!</li>
    <li> Although I spend quite a while doing my makeup most days, my frizzy, fine, semi-wavy hair has led to years and years of letting it air-dry and then pulling it back with a clip or ponytail holder to just get it the heck out of the way.  Enter this hot air brush.  I have had this product for a few weeks now, and I use it every morning and *love* it!  It dries and styles my hair simultaneously and does so fairly quickly.  I can now dry and style my hair with just one hand as I build great volume and lift and get great smooth flips incredibly easily.  The bristles in addition to the plastic prongs mean the dryer grabs and actually holds on to my hair, whereas I typically need to hold my hair on as I use a styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The few things I would change would be the button and the tip.  The slider button works just fine, but I think a button might be easier as you transition from heat to cool, to set the gentle curls.  When drying the back of my head, I often reach to stabilize the styler and keep it level, so I can tell you that the tip gets very hot!  I am sure there is a reason they made it with the material they did, but I would like to see them coat it with a material that remains cool to the touch.  It would also be great if the cord retracted, though I fear they would need to make the barrel larger for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product highly enough to those who are looking for a product that will dry their hair as it adds volume and body.  I love it and, when it inevitably wears out some day, I will most definitely be purchasing another.</li>
    <li> I am new to the world of hot air brushes and I am very happy so far. Styling with this brush takes longer than my powerful blow dryer, but I like the end result. My hair comes out smoother and the layers show more definition and movement - just like they do when my stylist blows it dry. I am not sure I will be able to spend the time to use this brush every day, but it is great to have another \\&quot;look\\&quot; to achieve on the days I want/need to put in the time! It even worked on the back of my head, which is an area I have not devoted much concern to in the past! I do wish it had more power. Also, the way the sliding control button is designed makes it hard for me to use. If you slide it all the way to the end it goes to a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting rather than the highest, hottest setting. That setting is one notch back and it is difficult to get it to slide back just that little notch to get the high hot setting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very powerful.</li>
    <li> I bought this back in December 2011 and at first I really didn&#x27;t like it.  I used it in place of my regular hair dryer and my hair was very frizzy and still slightly damp after about 20 minutes with this.  I ended up needing my regular hair dryer and flat iron to finish the job.  I tried it to finish my hair after using my regular hair drier and I still didn&#x27;t love it.  So in the drawer and out of sight it went.  Several months to a year later, I pulled it out again and started trying different ways to use it.  I have super thick hair this is currently medium length and it loves to frizz a lot.  I didn&#x27;t used to dry my hair daily because it was a 45 minute process and involved a couple of hair products and a hair dryer and flat iron to make it look great.  My hair is naturally super curly and takes a long time to dry.  Normally I&#x27;d just put a little style cream in my hair, tie it back in a ponytail and go.  Not the cutest look but necessary since I wasn&#x27;t willing to give up that much sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I style my hair every day and it only takes me 15 minutes with this little gem.  I towel dry my hair for a minute or two, comb it out and put a dime size amount of Sebastian Potion 9 in it.  I let it air dry for about 2 to 3 minutes while I get ready and then start with this hot air brush.  I take small sections of my hair and slide the hair brush down a section starting from the scalp.  I run it down the section 2 to 3 times and then I roll my hair around the brush starting with the tips of my hair.  I roll it up to the scalp and wait about 5 seconds.  I slide the brush out and start on another section.  Once I have finished going around all the sections, I take a larger section and run this brush through it rolling from the bottom.  Once I&#x27;m happy with my hair, I put a dab (smaller than dime size) of Fekkai glossing cream in my hair and run it through my hair.  My hair holds the style for a couple of days and looks very shiny and feels amazingly soft.  I can&#x27;t believe I let this sit in my drawer unused for almost a year.  I use it 4 to 5 times a week now and it&#x27;s still going strong.  This also makes traveling a lot easier since now I&#x27;m not packing a separate brush, hair dryer and flat iron.  I&#x27;ll be getting a second one soon in case something happens to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this, I realized that I was trying to dry too much hair at once.  It works best when you can do small sections so it can properly dry the hair completely.  I don&#x27;t know if it works better than other brands since this is the only one I&#x27;ve used but this works amazing well and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.lieve I let this sit in my drawer unused for almost a year.

    <li> I used this for the first time today.  There is no learning curve which is great!  I had tried the InStyler and returned it, hated that product.  I&#x27;m sure I will get even better with this product with some practice.  Before I would blow dry with a round brush and then add some Velcro rollers and hit them with some heat to lock in a little more shape/volume and sometime use a curling iron too.  Now I don&#x27;t have to add the roller or use a curling iron to get my hair to cooperate into a decent style. My hair is cut to fringe in toward my face and this product does that beautifully, natural looking, not over curled like I sometimes get when I use a curling iron. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have fine blond hair.  This hair dryer/brush gives my hair body and shine and lift.  Hurrah for that.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I saw this on a lightning deal and grabbed it.  I already had a hot air brush, but was not satisfied with it as it was very loud and the bristles would not hold my fine hair without me holding it one the barrel.  The John Frieda is so much better, much quieter and the bristles hold my fine hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Saw this when I purchased the Frieda hair dryer. Love it. It makes doing my hair a breeze. Don&#x27;t know how I made it before I got it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it for my long hair but my neighbor loves it for her short and hard to manage hair so it&#x27;s been gifted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for 2 years. Only con is the slide switch for the temperature control. It could be easier to operate.</li>
    <li> I have long, relatively thin, relatively straight hair and this took FOREVER to dry my hair, forget it adding any curl... I waited a while for my hair to air dry before using, as per the recommendations on here, but this still wouldn&#x27;t dry it the rest of the way. There&#x27;s just not enough power. When I finally have in and blowdried it most of the way and then went back to using this terrible &amp;#34;curler&amp;#34; it did pretty much nothing. My hair was left looking semi-curled, semi-frizzy and not at all like a blowout.... sending it back!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder-length, layered, fine textured hair and this product is great for lift and body, especially on the top and crown.  I let my hair air-dry about 75 percent before using this hot air brush and it works great.  I would have to believe that it can be cumbersome and tiresome trying to dry longer, thicker or wetter hair because the wattage is lower than that of a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also see a lot of reviews criticizing the power/strength of the air flow.  This is done for your safety -- the dryer cannot be stronger (as it is with an external blow dryer) because the heat is applied directly to the hair.  A higher wattage would irreparably damage the hair and likely burn your scalp as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this anyone with hair similar to mine and to those who need/want more lift on the top of the head.</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy/curly-ish/frizzy, medium thickness and I  love the way my hair comes out after using this hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this brush for me is that I have to let my hair dry naturally (I use a super-absorbent hair towel) for a long time, over 30 minutes, before I use the Hot Air Brush. Otherwise, it won&#x27;t really dry well, but if I do wait the time and use this brush when my hair is slightly dried, it comes out beautiful, no frizz and with a lot of body, just like when you get it blown out at a salon! I don&#x27;t know what would make this product better other than maybe a stronger heat or more powerful, but I don&#x27;t mind letting my hair dry a bit before using this. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have such a hard time normally trying to straighten my hair but after I received this I am able to get the nice look I want at a fraction of the time it took using a blowdryer and brush. Works great TY for a great product</li>
    <li> Works fine for the price....nothing to brag about it does the job.  I like it for the most part it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Thank you. Enjoying my product.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I could have done for my hair.  I absolutely LOVE this airbrush. My hair and its pretty long and somewhat thick so I was really skeptical this airbrush was going to be able to manage it, This item has over exceeded my expectations,  I have finally found the most perfect tool that leaves my hair with that salon look and feel that I love .  I strongly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Two day review, like the design, brush head, color, and feel. I dont think it blows hot enough for my taste, even so,i am liking the product, blew my hair and it lasted all day.</li>
    <li> Great for blow drying and styling at the same time. I do however, blow dry my hair with my regular blow dryer first and then finish drying using this. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Hot Air Brush for a couple of weeks now. I was going to buy the brush from the infomercial (different brand) for 3 times the price but decided to try this instead. I love it. As many I struggled with a Hair Dryer and round brush for years. This product is so much easier to use and a lot quicker.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thinning hair, and this works perfectly giving lift and body and eliminating the need for rollers. In 7-months use it has not once become tangled in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The switch could be a bit easier to use by putting a larger edge, and it may not work quickly enough for thick, heavy hair.</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair and the wide brush gives me straighter hair that doesn&#x27;t keep the curl all day so I&#x27;m now using it as the back up to my backup dryer. If you have medium to short hair look for a hair dryer with a smaller brush size if you want any curl in your hair. Other than that this brush works very well. It dries damp hair very quickly. I like that the dryer has different settings but changing from one speed to another isn&#x27;t very user friendly.  This is a well made hair dryer but not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand for years but it fails right after the 12-mo warranty so you have to buy a new one each year. This has a longer warranty so I thought I&#x27;d try it, even though it does cost considerably more than what I was used to. It does dry and shape the hair well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two main complaints are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) that the brush head is not removable for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;2) the grey endcap by the brush is so short you cannot hold onto it to guide and control the brush. It will burn your fingers if used in hot mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is recommended that you wipe it down with a wet cloth but that doesn&#x27;t do the trick. After a few weeks of use with any type of styling spray, it gets gunky. I have to lift any excess hair off with a comb, then immerse the brush end into hot water, letting it sit there a bit before I can brush off the bristles with an old tooth brush to get the gunk off of it. I then towel dry it very well and am careful not to let any water near the handle part that has the electrical stuff inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Because the brush-head has bristles like a brush, as opposed to stationery hard plastic bristles, it is not very easy to clean, whereas my former styler did come apart and I found it easy to set it in a deep tumbler of warm water overnight and wipe off the next morning  :)</li>
    <li> Dont use anything but that this....no brushs....this does the trick.  Gives me curl, fast, pretty, luv it.  Best buy.. Get it</li>
    <li> I buy these for all my friends!  I blow out my own hair at the saloon and the assistant stylists look jealous that I can do an amazing style by myself!  Sorry.</li>
    <li> At my last trip to the salon, I got bangs. I haven&#x27;t had bangs since I was 10. I have long, straight and very fine hair. I needed a change but a playful pixie or a long bob weren&#x27;t options based on my hair type. Bangs seemed like a good alternative for a dramatic statement. I felt great about the cut when I left the salon but fretted recreating the look on my own. I can&#x27;t hold a blow dryer and opperate a round brush at the same time. I researched hot air brushed and stumbled upon this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to use. With a round brush, I am constantly working my hair into knots. I&#x27;ve been using this for months and have yet to tangle.&lt;br /&gt;- High, low, and cool heat settings. I typically use the high heat setting to dry my hair and then the low to style my bangs.&lt;br /&gt;- Salon-look shine. Being able to dry my hair piece by piece gives me that volume and body that I get after a cut at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;- 1.5&#x27;&#x27; brush. Curls and styles my bangs without making them 80&#x27;s big.&lt;br /&gt;- No need to use straightener. Unless you&#x27;re looking for stick straight, this tool can replace the blow dryer and the straight iron. Some days I blow dry with the regular dryer and then use this tool to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It takes a while. My straight, thin hair takes no time to dry with the blow dryer. This takes much longer. If you really want the styled look, you have to use clips and dry piece by piece.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not have a moveable cord like some of the others in this category&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend. The pros significantly outweigh the cons. This is a perfect tool for long, straight, fine hair.</li>
    <li> This has been a big time saver for me in drying/styling my hair. I have wavy, thick hair and to keep my hair from being frizzy or bushy I either have to use a large round brush while drying or use a flat iron after drying. This kind of combines those two. I say &amp;#34;kind of&amp;#34; because I occasionally do still use the iron on my bangs or cowlick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews are correct in that you should towel dry your hair a bit before using this. And using smaller sections of hair helps dry faster and keep down on the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewers are also right about this being light-weight though it doesn&#x27;t look or feel &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t feel substantial at first but then using it you realize that&#x27;s probably on purpose – my arms don&#x27;t get nearly as tired as they do when drying/straightening.</li>
    <li> Works great!!!!!  My hair is shinny and the set holds and holds.  I am very pleased.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this product two years ago and I really like it. It beats having to hold a blow dryer and brush at the same time. It seriously leaves my hair super smooth and soft and with a nice little bounce. It doesn&#x27;t get too hot at all. Perfect for maintaining my bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The only minus is that it takes forever to do my hair. The air isn&#x27;t super strong or steaming hot like a blow dryer (which is good so it wont burn your hair) but then it takes a tad longer to do your hair, section by section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I love it though. I can create luscious waves and even a few curls. I recently gave it to a friend for her birthday after she complained about her arms hurting from holding a blow dryer and brush. So it is obviously a good product if I deem it worthy enough to give as a gift and YES it is to someone I like (Lol!)</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a new hot air brush since my old Conair quit working.  I thought I would not be able to find one I liked as well but the John Frieda JFHA5 is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, curly, sometimes kinky hair and this brush does a great job.  It glides through my hair smoothly and never gets tangled.  It leaves my hair curly but not frizzy- I haven&#x27;t used my hair dryer since I bought this brush because it works so well as a dryer and a styler.  I highly recommend this John Frieda product!</li>
    <li> An incredible tool. Great for finishing the look, though it does not replace the normal hair dryer for my thin but curly hair.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my wife for Xmas. It died after  3 uses. Returned it to Amazon with no problem. Receved the new one a few days later and my wife hasn&#x27;t had any problems with it. It&#x27;s been 2 months. She uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> works great on thin hair</li>
    <li> I am incapable and not coordinated enough to use a round brush and hair dryer at the same time.  My arms get tired and I&#x27;m frustrated before I get done drying my first section of hair.  This product makes it so easy!  I dry my hair 95% with my regular hair dryer and then I use this nifty tool to finish drying and styling.  I am so pleased and it hardly costs more than a good round brush.  I feel like it&#x27;s healthier for my hair than my flat iron.  Please be aware that this hot air brush does not rotate on it&#x27;s own; I was not interested in that feature but you need to pick a different item if that&#x27;s important to you.</li>
    <li> Good settings. Wish there was of a toggle switch to move around the different settings, but can get used to the switch.  If you have any arthritis, or trouble with fine motor skills, this could be a tricky air brush to own.</li>
    <li> I am a 66 year old with joint pain.  It was always difficult and painful for me to hold the heavy hair dryer and also doing the turning motion withe brush while drying my hair.  I saw a youtube video on a hot air brush but not this brand.  I researched online checking reviews and noted that the John Frieda JFHA5 air brush had good reviews so I ordered it through Amazon.  Amazon had a better price then if I had bought at my local Walmart.  I have used it now for a few weeks and absolutely love it!  It was well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Love it! My cut is a medium length bob and am in my early 60s. Works great. Just bought my 2nd after wearing the 1st one out. It lasted almost 3 years. Replaced because the bristles were wearing out. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My hair often get stuck in the roll eand got pulled off. And it&#x27;s difficult to clean the hair out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like the heat setting as well. It&#x27;s either too hot or no heat.</li>
    <li> I have very difficult hair to style. It&#x27;s fine and curly and frizzes easily if there is any precipitation in the air. This hot air brush is a marvel. Styles my hair exactly as I want it and faster than my old dryer and it KEEPS the style even in damp weather! I love it so much I&#x27;m going to order 2 more so I have them when this one goes out. Another plus, it&#x27;s lighter than my previous brush which is nice. Highest recommendation!</li>
    <li> This brush is a great size for me and has enough heat and power to dry my hair fairly quickly and smoothly.  The only thing that would earn a 5th star is a cool tip at the end so I could use my other hand to help spin the brush.  The tip on this gets too hot to touch.</li>
    <li> My hair looks like I stepped out of the salon every morning. My hair is very fine and falls half way down my neck. I am not very coordinated when it comes to styling my hair so it never looked anything like my stylist sent me out the door with. However that is no longer the case. It also adds more shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> It is well designed, functional, have a little cool strap and is really light.&lt;br /&gt;But took me three times more to style my hair properly.</li>
    <li> This works very well- it adds volume and style. I like it!</li>
    <li> Just not a fan of this.  Takes forever to dry my hair and I just did not care for the results---note:  my hair is just above the shoulders.</li>
    <li> This did not work as well as I expected I was wanting more from John Freda salon</li>
    <li> Best hot airbrush EVER. Just what I was looking for in order to use only one hair tool for getting ready every morning and especialy those when I&#x27;m on a rush. Travel essential. I love it.</li>
    <li> Smoothed out even my thick, frizzy, dry hair. Dries and smooths in 5-10 minutes or less if I let it air dry a little while ahead of time. I was able to stop using the friZz ease serum thanks to this brush.</li>
    <li> Good product, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought it because of how many reviews this product had. I figured it was a ni brainer. It turned out that It takes longer brushing my hair with it than using a regular hair dryer + brush. If you are in a hurry this is not the way to go. I wish the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; option was really high. It blows as a low in a regular hairdryer. I&#x27;m dissapointed. Anyways, after you spend 20 min + doing your hair with it, the hair looks good.</li>
    <li> Finally found an easy to use device that makes blowing my hair dry a very simple, fast process.  Can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read all the reviews and thought, no way an this be that great.  I love it!  I am 52 and jut getting a frizz to my hair.  This takes all the frizz out ad leaves my medium short hair fluffy.  I love it without hardly any product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m that person who tries absolutely everything to fight the masses of fine, tight ringlets and am disappointed 8/10 times with the result. As I was drying my hair with the John Frieda hot air brush this morning, I literally could not believe I was looking at my own hair. So shiny! So soft! I only needed to use my flat iron at the roots to ensure they were really dry -- I can see this saving my hair from a lot of damaging heat over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only mild disappointment was that it didn&#x27;t cut down on drying time for me; I&#x27;m actually glad I didn&#x27;t notice how low the wattage was before I ordered it or I might have missed out on how much frustration (and self-hair-loathing) it ultimately saved me. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the John Frieda Brush, but the head was too large for me to use. Wish it can in a small size. I did like it! Nerry Jimenez</li>
    <li> I liked this when I had longer hair, but wish it got just a little hotter. I generally pre-dry or air dry my hair about 2/3 dry and then use the Hot Air Brush. For shorter hair, I would buy one with a smaller barrel if it were available.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this on amazon i bought it at cvs but i felt i had to write a review because this hot air brush is AMAZING. I have curly hair that reaches my mid back and using this was so easy. I let it dry about 80% and used a light hair oil on my ends. I love my curly hair but as a every day hair style it drove me crazy because i could never get the shape i wanted to and my curls just did what they wanted. I am anti flat iron after using one for so many years and finally growing out my hair so it can be healthy and wanted something for my hair that wouldnt cause a lot of damage. This hot air brush is amazing, it made me look as if i just walked out of the salon the first time i used it, it was so easy. Also wanted to add i bought the Conair h ot air brush to try it out and it was horrible it didnt work for me. The spin function got my hair caught in the brush and the worst part the metal got so hot it burnt my finger. This one doesnt get hot like the conair one. This really has really helped me so much because not only is it fast but i am so happy with the way my hair looks now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Transforms your hair&lt;br /&gt;Quiet&lt;br /&gt;Eliminates frizz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I didnt get this sooner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you dont want to crush the bristles when you store it they sell plastic covers at beauty supply stores</li>
    <li> Returning this product. Since the hair blows out from the brush, it forced all my fly aways out and made my hair look much worse! Awful concept, not sure why it has so many great reviews, perhaps its just not great for fine hair?</li>
    <li> 3 months later and it&#x27;s dead. Proceed with caution.</li>
    <li> love it, easy to carry and makes life so much easier with brush and blow dryer in one. Wont recommend this product to those with thick and heavy hair</li>
    <li> It is a styler and if you are expecting it to dry your hair then you are on the wrong track like me. And you can&#x27;t take the brush off another con for me. I had to buy a separate  blow dryer. Not really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I had one that died and I got this one . I like this style because it is easy to handle.one thing not a brush and the dryer.. Not sure if you were looking for curl if you would get from this one but for what I want it works.</li>
    <li> How did I do without this?  I love this brush.  I dry my hair first part way with a regular hair dryer and then use this.  I like the settings so that you can vary depending on your hair type.  I use the hot until it is styled and then go over it with the cool settting.  It smooths out my hair which tends to have some issues with the ends sticking out, no more.  This was a find!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom who&#x27;s old one had broke and she had tried so many and just couldn&#x27;t find the perfect one.  She had bought herself a new one at the same time I got this one, and she prefers the John Frieda.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have fine curly hair and this smoothes it into soft waves and curls while adding  volume, lift and shine. AND... The  soft curls last the next day.  My hair feels amazing soft, smooth, healthy and has more length.  I&#x27;ve worn my naturally curly hair for decades. This is the first time I&#x27;ve switched up.  I want to see how the look holds up in summer humidity. I can&#x27;t even imagine a better product.  I&#x27;ll be buying this for LIFE!</li>
    <li> This brush does exactly what it suppose to do! I really like it.... It worth the money. If you are looking for a brush to make big curls this is not for you. It brush your hair pretty good and styles it pretty good tho...... :)</li>
    <li> I have very fine, fly-away hair. Other hot air curling burshes always leave my hair frizzy with lots of loose fly-away strands.  This is the ONLY one that leaves my hair smooth and adds some body.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it!......couldn&#x27;t be without it now.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Perfect for hairpieces.</li>
    <li> The product works. I love the all in one dryer and shaper (from barely damp hair, not wet!). It just doesn&#x27;t work for a long enough period of time. I purchased mine 4 months ago and the motor seems to be dying already. It gets overly hot and tonight the motor actually cut off for a millisecond several times. Waiting to hear back from the company on the warranty for this product.   Update 3/6/17: It wasn&#x27;t the motor that was dying, my cord was acting up. It stays on my counter and I don&#x27;t wrap the cord up so not sure why except for just by using it. It finally died completely this morning- 2 years after I purchased it. I did purchase another as it really does work better than ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  The first one finally died, but they won&#x27;t last forever!  But for the money it works great and your hair will not tangle in the brush.  I partially dry my hair with a regular hair dryer, then use this to style.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what I was expecting. I&#x27;m more than happy with this. I bought this product for my mom  she is not able to straighten her hair by herself,  she always complained about her arms and neck getting to tired every time she used a flat iron,  or a blower, even the in styler she said to be afraid to burn herself with it. So I always had to blow dry her hair for like an hour (not an easy job). She tried this out yesterday and her hair looks so beautiful,  soft, with texture and she looked so happy amd proud of herself because she could do it on her own, I was shocked.. maybe this sounds silly but I felt this was the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever done.  More than 5 stars for this product.</li>
    <li> It normally takes me 45 minutes to do a good blowout on my long, layered, thick hair. Being a new mom, I can&#x27;t spend this much time on my hair. This air brush is awesome for giving a salon-quality blowout that really lasts. The bristles help you get good tension in the hair and the barrel diameter is perfect. The air brush is really lightweight, so your arm won&#x27;t get sore like it would with a blowdryer. A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- For thicker hair, it won&#x27;t cut your styling time in half, though it will still reduce it. I&#x27;ve found that I need to rough dry my hair with the blowdryer until it&#x27;s 90% dry, then use the air brush while sectioning the hair (exactly how you&#x27;d do it with a round brush and dryer).&lt;br /&gt;- To really get the top layers smooth, I use the brush over and under the hair.&lt;br /&gt;- I take my time to do a good blowout once a week, and then use the air brush for a quick refresh every morning afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;- To clean the brush, I just run a comb through the bristles after every use.&lt;br /&gt;- It may seem like the air isn&#x27;t hot enough, but I think the lower heat is actually better for your hair. It still straightens my hair but hasn&#x27;t caused any breakage so far.&lt;br /&gt;- You still need to manually rotate the brush to smooth hair, but I don&#x27;t see this as a con - I would never want to risk using one of those rotating brushes that the hair could get all tangled up in.&lt;br /&gt;- You can get really close to the roots and won&#x27;t burn your scalp, which helps get that amazing bounce and body you get from a salon blowout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would guess that this could be a perfect tool for those with fine hair. For those with thicker hair, it&#x27;s great, but still requires a good amount of work to use. Still, it makes the process much easier!</li>
    <li> This brush is so easy to use, it&#x27;s very lightweight. It&#x27;s also very powerful for such a small brush. I can dry my hair in half the time as I did before.</li>
    <li> Probably one of the best hair care investments I&#x27;ve ever made. It not only saves time but money. It has already paid for itself!!</li>
    <li> I have great coordination for most things but not for holding a blow dryer and brush and actually twisting and turning the brush at the same time so THIS has been a lifesaver and major time SAVER for me. I have tried a few of the Conair versions and they tend to get hot and burn me on the brush area or they have not lasted.  But neither of the Conair ones have produced the affect that is like what you get at the salon with the dryer and a round brush. The John Frieda does!!!! The only downside is that it takes a long time to dry from very wet hair. But I cut the time by blow drying my hair with my regular hair dryer and once it&#x27;s damp, I finish up with this. It doesn&#x27;t blow loose strands of hair all over the place while it&#x27;s working. Some other brands I have tried have air coming out in the middle and they do that.  Then I am left with all kinds of frizzy strands sticking up all over the place.  I just can&#x27;t say enough about this little gem of a find. The one downside I found was that the on/off switch is a little hard to use. But I have gotten used to it and it&#x27;s not a big deal at all anymore. I hope they never stop making it because it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I really, really, want to love this after reading so many rave reviews about it.  I found this product through Cop of Jo, Caroline&#x27;s recommendation. However, not so sure what to think about it.&lt;br /&gt;I got this in the hope to create &amp;#34;natural waves,&amp;#34; just like how caroline showed on Cop of Jo review if you know what I am saying.  But i only ended up with straighter hair than I already have. Maybe it is because I am not a hair tool savvy or....  I dont know. well... One good thing is this really builds volume when you dry from the root.</li>
    <li> Returned it because it does not rotate.</li>
    <li> I use this every day, smooths my hair nicely without the damage of a straightener.  Gives a nice bend on the ends too...</li>
    <li> Talked with a beautician before I used it and she advised me to pull down when using this specialized hair drying and curling device, and to be sure to protect your hair with product, I did and I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than I had hoped for! Before I got this Hot Air Brush I had to use a blow dryer, a different hot air brush &amp; a flat iron! This takes the place of all 3 in much less time, with much less work, AND my hair looks so much better. I am very happy with this Brush &amp; will tell people to try it. The temp it heats to is hot enough to work but doesn&#x27;t burn like the last brush I used.</li>
    <li> Love this thing! Where has it been all my life? Style, curl and dry in one move!♡</li>
    <li> I have always struggles to hold a brush and blow dry my hair and this solved all my problems! It really does grip my thin fine hair and give it some extra volume! Its been a great investment!</li>
    <li> I have longer thick hair so I can put some wave in it but it takes a bit long to style after drying it so does not save me the time I was hoping.  So nice product but maybe not for my hair...</li>
    <li> I love this product so much, I bought two more to have just in case!  I have fine, thin, wavy hair which often turns frizzy and is difficult to style because of cowlicks.  This not only managed the frizz and cowlicks, but it cut my styling time in half!  My hair looks shiny and styled like a salon blowout without all the effort and sore arms.  And with mousse, it actually gave me body and fullness on top, which usually I don&#x27;t have.  Love love love this product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> there is no power to this hot air brush.  Perhaps it would work for someone with short hair but I have long hair and it is useless.</li>
    <li> Does not snag hair. Releases gently. Good drying ability. I love it. Would like all sizes of barrels they make.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this hot air brush, I didn&#x27;t like it. It left my hair flat and lifeless. I was ready to send it back when I thought I&#x27;d give it one more try. Boy, was I glad I did. I have past my shoulder- length hair. I blow dry my hair with a regular blow dryer with my hair flipped upside down to give it volume. Next I use the air brush, section by section. I start at the roots of one section and work my way down to the ends, first using hot for 10 seconds and then switching to cool to set in the lift. It leaves my fine hair full and shiny. The great thing about it is that you do not have to use a round brush with a blow dryer. Because it&#x27;s an all-in-one tool, it is so easy to handle. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Much better than the alternative to styling wet hair.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it a blower a dryer and a brush in one bundle. Cheap and way better than those other hair straighteners, it straightens and curls your hair</li>
    <li> Smooth curls for long, thick hair. No frizzes! Just wish the tip had more cool area to grip. Good swivel cord.</li>
    <li> After reading most of the reviews, I thought I better give the Hot Air Brush a try.  The blow dryer part is not very powerful.  I have thick, course, wavy, long (to the middle of my back) hair that needs heat to take out most of the frizz.  This is not a miracle worker.  I still have to almost totally blow dry my hair with my blow dryer.  Once it&#x27;s mostly dry, I use the Hot Air Brush to build in body, but I still have to use my other blow dryer on top of it to get enough heat and drying action (and my flat iron to work out some of my curl).  I was hoping this Air Brush would help to take a step out of my morning routine- this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. For those with smooth, lovely hair already, this may be the ticket to build in long lasting body.  My mom has short hair and she loved it, the Hot Air Brush gave her body and dried her hair.  For $30, it was worth a try!  I think I&#x27;ll be giving this to my mom.</li>
    <li> I COULDN&#x27;T WAIT TO GET THIS BRUSH. LOVE IT. MY MOM EVEN BOUGHT ONE. IT WAS MUCH QUIETER YET WAS VERY POWERFUL.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product. I use it mostly to straighten my roots which was a little difficult with a straightner. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great styling tool!  I use another dryer to get my hair mostly dry, but this thing replaces all my round brushes and saves me a ton of time in the morning and gets me the results I have been struggling for, and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Love the brush and the price was cheaper than in walmart.</li>
    <li> Great product! I can control this so much better than a hairdryer + round brush.</li>
    <li> Not meant for people who have thicker and stubborn (frizzy) hair, the low wattage will not do much on such hair. Nothing wrong with it, it&#x27;s just wasn&#x27;t powerful enough for me. I returned it and got a similar hot air brush with higher wattage.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!! Light weight easy to use and makes my hair smooth and shiny. When used with John Frieda root lifting products my hair even looks fuller. Best Christmas gift ever.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this!  I bought it for me as I haven&#x27;t blow dried my hair with a round brush for years but I found that going back to a round brush was a little easier for me.  But my daughter who has never used a round brush while blow drying her hair (it takes practice) loves this.  It is quick and not much of a learning curve and her hair is beautiful after.  She has long hair and a little fine but lots of hair and it still goes quick and comes out looking soft and natural with a lot of movement. She added no other products and it did last for two days.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I bought to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s house!  It really saves me time and really does a nice job on my hair!</li>
    <li> I wish I would have bought one of these years ago! So much easier than using a round brush and blow dryer. I have medium to long straight hair and it&#x27;s hard to get any volume and life in it, but I think this is going to help greatly. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, so my results should only get better. I still start off with my regular blow dryer as most reviewers recommended and then section of my hair and use this to add volume and make it look more styled. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be going back to using a regular round brush!</li>
    <li> Not real happy with this product. I have been using a round hair dryer like this for over 20 years.  I already have curly hair. All I do is curl my bangs off to the side when my hair is damp. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough.</li>
    <li> Love it! I dont have to go to the salon no more, great for fine hair like mine i will recommended</li>
    <li> This is really nice if you&#x27;re like me and not quite coordinated enough to use a round brush well and point the blow dryer the right way at the same time. It isn&#x27;t as powerful as other blow dryers, so like others have said, it may work best to dry your hair slightly first and then finish off with this one, especially if your hair is thick. Others who are used to using a round brush may get better results sticking to that, but for me, this works better and I&#x27;m more likely to do it since it&#x27;s less of a struggle.</li>
    <li> I hoped it would curl my hair (short) but instead it straitened it. I will try again to use this brush..</li>
    <li> Use this just about daily for about a year now.  Straightens my hair and also smooths it.  Can hold it in place while drying if you want some curl.  As others have noted, they really could improve the control button.  It is flat, does not have a bump on it so that you can slide it on and off easily.  This really should have been caught by the manufacturer prior to producing them and I am taking a full star off for that feature.  Love everything else about it.</li>
    <li> Best curling brush I have ever owned! (And - I have tried many.) Also have the larger size, which I use most of the time.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like to curl your hair, then maybe this product is for you. I feel I get the same effect with my curling iron. The only difference is this brush may add a tiny bit more volume than an iron. I bought it thinking it might save me some time when getting ready, using just this brush instead of blow drying and then curling. But in reality, it turned out to be almost the same amount of time with either method I chose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the buttons on the brush. I often turn the brush to \\&quot;cool\\&quot; on accident while styling because the button moves way too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is great for the price, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday. I disccontinued use after a couple of weeks because I noticed that my fine hair was begining to show ALOT of breakage from this brush. But everyone&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
    <li> I really like this curling drier. It is very easy to use and does not make my hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> Great for blow outs for short/fine hair.</li>
    <li> Best purchase in a while. I love how easy it is to use and fast it dries!!</li>
    <li> The product is very noisy, gets very hot and it is not the best tool for curly and short hair.</li>
    <li> I have been with Amazon since the day they went into business years ago and I can&#x27;t remember waiting this long for any order. Once it arrived, I was disappointed. The barrel is the larger size, but the handle is even bigger and my hand cannot grasp it easily so it is difficult to use. The jury is still out on whether it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for me, since I find it difficult to hold a more than one styling object at a time! I would fail as a hairdresser, that&#x27;s for sure! I love the way this hot air brush turns my hair under or flips it up so easily, with such cute results! I have already recommended it to my friends. It saves me time and makes it easy to style my hair, both tops on my list!</li>
    <li> Really sucks!!! The first time i used this was a bit tiring xperience ..;( a few weeks later i was trying to use it again but it was just shut down and its not working!!!i was planning to report this air brush but unfortunately the original box is broken and i put it in a bin..(( not worth it to buy!!</li>
    <li> Nice hair dryer. Large barrel is best for those with long hair.   Takes a little longer to create a curl than I thought it would but overall its a good dryer.</li>
    <li> I just received this and used it 2 days in a row and all I can say is WOW!  This is awesome and I wish I found this years ago.  I am challenged when it comes to using a brush and blow dryer - never had the patience or time it seemed to take me.  I have shoulder length long layered hair that is thick with a weird curl to it.  With this product it took me no time at all to style my hair.  I used my regular blow dryer first til my hair was about 85% dry.  Then I randomly sectioned my hair and started using the hot air brush.  It was very easy to use - I used the brush on each section on high heat until I got the look I desired and then went over it one more time on cool heat.  My hair looks shiny and almost as good as the day I step out of the salon.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> If you are looking to get a blowout at home, try this! I have shoulder length, thick, curly hair and this airbrush gave me smooth hair with bouncy ends. It works best if your hair is 90% dry before styling, especially at your roots and the back of your head. I received mine as a gift but I loved it so much I bought one for my mom.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Easy to use and works great. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it even more once I perfect a technique. Gives your hair tons of body</li>
    <li> well if you dont need something too strong it can work for you, i think the power should be stronger, you have to wait hours so the hair will not be spongy</li>
    <li> I love this styling brush.  I have long wavy hair and it helps me quickly smooth and style without the need for a flat iron/curling iron.  I read a lot of product reviews about various hot air styling brushes, and this one consistently rated very highly.  I first use my blow dryer to quickly get most of the moisture out of my hair, then follow with this brush to smooth, shape, and style.  This does exactly as it says, it is an excellent product at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Help straighten my curly hair. One step makes it easier to use!! I like that it also has a cooling button as well..</li>
    <li> This styler does not produce enough air or heat to quickly dry or style my hair (medium thick and wavy).  It takes WAY too long to work.  I had a similar product previously that dried my hair very quickly and straightened at the same time.  I was hoping to accomplish the same thing with this styler but with more body.  I don&#x27;t have time in the morning to dry/style my hair piece by piece.  I have ordered a replacement.</li>
    <li> Read a review which stated the dryer did not dry her hair very well and almost did not order it.  My stylist stated it was a good air brush so I went ahead and got it.  Very glad I did.  In reading the directions is recommends blow drying wet hair first to 80% dry and then using the Air Brush to style and dry hair the rest of the way.  Did this and no problems.  Love this air brush!</li>
    <li> That was the best brush air dryer I have ever purchased. I can style so quick and the final look is great,frizz free smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations but the airflow on this brush is lacking. Didn&#x27;t give me any style or control. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, thin hair.  95% of the time, my hair is in clips or a tail.  When I do need to style my hair, this works wonders.  Yes I have to use a regular dryer to remove the initial excess moisture. But this tool makes my hair smooth and not a bit of frizz.  In fact, this gives my hair body.  Need to take small sections. The bristles grab the hair completely. I love it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush.  It is gentle on my hair and so far I haven&#x27;t gotten it tangled up in my hair.</li>
    <li> Best hair curler/drier I have ever used. Please don&#x27;t stop making it. I tell everyone about it.</li>
    <li> This brush/hair dryer is amazing! I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it. I would suggest it to anyone that has short hair. It is so easy to use and adds a little bounce to your hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything so it wouldn&#x27;t  be the frizz ball it was when I washed it. I bought that one they sell on tv which works great on thick  hair, but not shoulder length. My thinning, fine hair despaired and it was a constant pony tail time. I bought this and my hair is shiny&amp;straight, and just loving it. My hair dries really fast so I don&#x27;t need the high heat.</li>
    <li> I returned this &amp;#34;nondryer&amp;#34; for the same reason others complained about it. It doesn&#x27;t dry even my short fine hair, but left it limp and damp. I&#x27;ll srick with my old dryer air brush without ions which dries my hair with lift and has more power.</li>
    <li> My hair has to grow a little more to take advantage of this.  Like the idea of hot air blowing.  Had one years ago.....</li>
    <li> Seriously, this is the dryer I have been waiting for my whole life. Every day is a great hair day - and I DO NOT have great hair!  Easy to use. Fast. Affordable. And, does what it says it will and then some. I am tempted to buy another to keep in the closet for when this one eventually breaks - I love it that much and will never (if I have any say in it - which I do) use another dryer on my hair again. Seriously, my hair looks FAB!</li>
    <li> The hot air brush is easy to use. Rather than using the dryer in one hand and the brush in another it is so much easier to have it all in one!</li>
    <li> I have short hair and this hot air brush is easy to use and and gives smooth shiny results. I pre dry my hair about 80% before I section my hair and run this through to smooth and completely dry my hair. Very pleased with purchase!</li>
    <li> I really like this hot air brush.  It is fast and styles your hair easily.  I no longer have to mess with a brush and blow dryer.  And it is much healthier on my hair than flat ironing it everyday.  Super glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  Works perfectly!  Love how my hair looks when I use it.  Only wish I had more time to use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair which takes time to dry. Not one to spend a lot of time in front of a mirror, I never have the patience to dry and then style. This is the best hot air brush I have ever used. It leaves my hair silky smooth, cuts the time needed in half and it doesn&#x27;t leave you deaf. I will order another one, just in case this one stops working in a couple of years and they no longer make it.</li>
    <li> Nice updated version of the original Hot Air Brush. John Frieda can usually be counted on for quality products and so far I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This hot air brush does everything it advertises and it&#x27;s gentle, so good to the hair. The three heat settings make it very good for waving while drying and ultimately setting the curl with cold air. It is true, as others have written, that the end comes off, very annoyingly, and must be masking taped closed to use it conveniently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that they do not make the same brush in a smaller size. I have thin shoulder-length hair and the size of this dryer-brush means that it only makes a gentle wave in my hair when I&#x27;d like more curl, so sometimes I have to use a curling iron also.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have always been looking for something like this. Makes it so easy to dry and style.</li>
    <li> I do like it but I have long hair and i cannot roll it around the brush to get a curl,  I can only do a wave.</li>
    <li> Read numerous reviews for this type of dyer/brush. I finally decided on this one about 2 months ago and have been so pleased with it. It is shorter in the barrel than my old revlon because it has less of a tip - which actually makes it easier to maneuver. It is not a detachable barrel which is what I was looking for. dries fast but is most effective when hair is partially air dried.&lt;br /&gt;Great for price! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was searching for a ROTATING hair drying brush and this came up on my search so I figured it was what I was looking for. However, when I received it I was sadly disappointed that it does not rotate; it only blows hot air. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this much because since it blows hot air outwards it leaves my hair frizzier than if I blow dried my hair inwards with a round brush and a hair dryer</li>
    <li> I have to wait until my hair is almost completely dry to use this brush, and even then, it takes forever to dry completely.&lt;br /&gt;The results look great, but I just don&#x27;t have that much time in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing on a whim after my stylist had told me one of her clients had been happy with the \\&quot;Instyler\\&quot; product. After my review reading self checked it out on amazon, I decided it was overpriced and I probably wouldn&#x27;t be happy with it. Somehow I came across this gem and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is some background about myself and hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no versatility or coordination when it comes to styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;New mom looking for something to help me look put together since drying/straightening was often too much of a production.&lt;br /&gt;Shoulder length thick/fine hair (if that even makes sense)&lt;br /&gt;Filled with random cowlicks and uneven waves/curls/straight areas&lt;br /&gt;Retains moisture like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically did the hair dryer thing and followed with a Chi straightener. I had noticed over the past few years my hair started resembling a bad hair commercial. It looked fine, but due to the fact it retained moisture, I was never patient enough to get it COMPLETELY dry with the hair dryer. Oh, and that entire thing with a round brush/hair dryer, never worked for me. In the early 2000&#x27;s I used hot rollers and my hair always looked flawless. Then one day it started looking &#x27;dated&#x27; and I switched to the straightening. Now when I try hot rollers, it just doesn&#x27;t look right anymore because of the damage from the straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical to use this product because I just didn&#x27;t know if it would get my hair dry enough. To my surprise, it did! It does take some time, but probably about 5 minutes more than drying/straightening. That 5 minutes is so worth the final product of my hair. My hair looks styled and is smooth. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t quite get the cowlicks out. That&#x27;s probably due to more laziness on my part and not using the right products. I have found that winding sections all the way to the root of my hair and letting it sit there for a few minutes gives me the best results and gets it the driest. Most of the time this product forces me to address all sections of my hair to ensure they are dry and straight. I constantly missed areas with my old routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving it 4 stars because I do feel like it could have a bit more power. However, this has proven to be way less damaging on my hair than my old routine of drying/straightening. I&#x27;m not sure if an increase of power would cause damage or not.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s east to use, at first you find you think it is not working, because the bristles seem to not grab your hair, I use it in conjunction with a hair dryer, it takes no time to get ready! And your hair should not be very wet out of the shower, let it half way dry before using. And for retouches or to tame the frizz it&#x27;s the best just on its own.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1L4P0VC2F1XAI]]FINALLY!!  A dryer brush that works as good as, or better, than my old one!  I just got this today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  The reviews indicated that it was worth the purchase, and it IS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 years ago my trusty old conair dryer brush fell apart.  I&#x27;ve been through 3 dryer brushes since then, none of which worked worth a darn, and didn&#x27;t hold out much hope of finding one at all that would work with my thick longish hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...my hair looks fabulous...BETTER than when I get it done at the salon.  Seems no one at the salon ever listens to me and does my hair *exactly* the way I like it.  Don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore.  I can go back to doing it myself, and it looks just the way I want it.  My hair is slightly curly and when left to air dry, it gets frizzy...and if they don&#x27;t dry it COMPLETELY at the salon...it gets frizzy.  No worries with this - I dry it until it slips through the bristles like silk and I know it&#x27;s perfect.  The bristles on this brush are really great with my hair.  Most of the ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past few years have \\&quot;hair type bristles\\&quot; that will not go all the way through my hair and are a real pain.  The bristles on this are a combination of hair and hard plastic bristles...exactly what is needed for thick hair...they work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw where several people complained about the controls...I didn&#x27;t find that to be a problem for me at all.  They are right at the perfect place where I can easily slide it from low to high or to cool.  I usually only use high anyway, but I didn&#x27;t think it was an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post a video review when I get time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*ADDED COMMENT*  January 15, 2015: I am still using this dryer brush and still love it!  I am purchasing one for my Mom, in fact.  I would love to add a couple of before/after pics, but cannot figure out how to do that.  This is the only drying tool I use, and 98% of the time, except for heat protectant,  I don&#x27;t use mousse or any other product to make my hair behave, and it&#x27;s always perfect.ept for heat protectant,  I don&#x27;t use mousse or any other product to make my hair behave, and it&#x27;s always perfect.</li>
    <li> This handy device dries my limp, fine hair and gives it body while drying it. I find that it works best for me by letting my hair partially air dry and then using the brush. I end up with a fuller hairdo that is flattering and easy to do. My fine hair takes a long time to dry (ask my hair dresser who can take 30-45 to dry and style it) and this drastically cuts down on the time and effort it takes while giving me the fuller hair that I like.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thinning, curly hair. This works great for me. I&#x27;ve never mastered the dryer in one hand and round brush in the other for straightening. This does both and leaves your hair frizz free.  It works on damp or dry hair too. There is a design flaw in that if you push the on button all the way up it&#x27;s only cool air. So to dry or style you have to leave it one notch down. I&#x27;ve seen where others have returned it because they thought it didn&#x27;t get hot. The other great thing about this is the bristles. Conair, which makes this dryer, had a predecessor that was natural bristles that wore down over time. Other mfrs make plastic bristles that are too hard or don&#x27;t grab the hair. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush - does a great job styling/smoothing my hair.  You just have to remember it is a styling tool - not a blow dryer, so don&#x27;t expect it to do more than style.  Use it after blow drying and you will be happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Just make sure hair is about 85% dry, then do it in sections. It looks great, and it&#x27;s a good arm workout!</li>
    <li> I like this item but wish the actual barrel head was smaller for my length of hair.  Should have gone to the store to check out in person; then I would not have ordered it since my hair is only chin length and this does not curl around it enough.</li>
    <li> Why did I get a product covered in hair when I paid for a new one? I expect better than this.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and shoulder length and this works extremely well.  Just love it.  Tried the more expensive versions but not worth it.  You will not be disappointed.  I can&#x27;t imagine not having this styling tool.</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times and when I do my hair does come out great!  I do wish the brush blew a little harder and that the bristles where stronger.  Also, as far as curling hair this will not work but it does create a nice wave.  I am growing my hair long for the first time in my life so this is a learning process as to what works.  I would recommend this hot air brush to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have to say I really love this item, despite a couple of small quirks. The control slider for temperature selections is very stiff and hard to make precise(from hot to cool then back to hot), but other than that, and my wish that the bristles spun around the cylinder, it is wonderful. It has almost replaced my In-styler (except for those super flat-iron look days). The price is right.</li>
    <li> This dries your hair in less time than a traditional blow dryer and separate brush.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is different lengths and works beautifully on both.  I have a free hand!&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn your skin.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I no longer burn my face or hands.  I used to get a lot of burns from my flat iron....and this works just as good ... no...better .... I am Burn Free !!!!</li>
    <li> The idea of a hot air brush was a super idea for me.  However, I did have problems with using it as it broke hair off and gave my overall hair do a somewhat fuzzy appearance.  Practice should improve this.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have medium-curly hair and found that using this will completely straighten my hair when I&#x27;m in the mood for straight instead of curly. Definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Works great but takes forever on my hair because it is supper thick! Much better for mostly dry hair if you have thick long hair! Amazing for short layered hair. Brush is soft and no tangle!</li>
    <li> Arrived broken. I unfortunately had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn&#x27;t return it. On its very first use it smoked immediately. I am ordering a replacement due to all the good reviews to give this one last chance.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. As a hair dresser you will need to know, when using this blow dryer to make the curls, make sure you keep half of your hair stand humid while you are rolling the brush on it and keep it rolled for about 10-12 second then MAKE SURE you unwind the strand off of the brush instead of pulling it out....Happy Styling!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, hair takes me no time to do now, lovely and shiney.  x[[ASIN:B0056GDG90 John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush]]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just not hot enough to style my hair. Also, the temperature differences could be marked better.Great idea, just needs more power.</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair, but tons of it. Pretty much stick straight, except for a couple of areas along the bottom that like to do this strange little wave, making my hair look more than a little crazy at times. I typically blow dry, then use a straightener to smooth out those waves, though it almost never lasts more than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how my hair looks after going to the salon and getting it blown out, but I could never replicate that look at home. I&#x27;m one of the hopelessly uncoordinated, that can&#x27;t use a hair dryer and round brush at the same time and have (more than once) had a brush stuck in my hair. Pretty sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this hot air brush once, I had the hang of it and had sleek, shiny, soft hair. It curled under at the ends, like I wanted it to, and a straightener wasn&#x27;t necessary at all, saving me time. It&#x27;s easy to hold, easy to work through my hair, and it does a great job at smoothing, curling, and drying all at the same time. I was definitely impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used my straightener for those wavy areas in weeks. What a fantastic tool! The price point is great and I know I&#x27;ll be getting daily use out of this brush. A+</li>
    <li> I like the hot air brush, but I have very long hair and with no handle on the other end of the brush it makes it a little frustrating to blow/curl. Also the \\&quot;low\\&quot; feature is not very hot at all so I have to use the \\&quot;high\\&quot; to get enough heat. I am sure this product is great for shorter and thinner hair. I am not returning the product, but I would not buy it again. It works just okay.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a magazine and I was not disappointed. Being a mom of young children I don&#x27;t get much time to get ready and sometimes I can only use one hand get ready since the other is needed to keep my son out of the toilet and this product is perfect for that. Even on low, it dries my hair efficiently and effectively because of the design. My hair always looks great after using it. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love this, it works great, perfectly for my hair.  Dries my hair quickly, makes it smooth and shiny and straight.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, gives a nice look! The switch is in a place where sometimes you move it while drying but not really a problem! I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight hair. This brush works well with drying and shaping although I use regular blowdryer first, drying hair just a little. It does make it very soft so if you have texture or curl issues be sure to use adequate amount of styling product. Have even used blowdryer with big brush first on the top layers to achieve volume as this hot air brush makes hair very soft. Glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with how this brush works even on my fairly short hair.  It \\&quot;grabs\\&quot; the hair so that you get a smooth and shiny blow out.</li>
    <li> I like this hair drier )))) easy and comfortable. Can recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I could dry and style my hair using just one tool.  I style my hair with a round brush and blow dryer in a \\&quot;Bob\\&quot; hairstyle.  This tool didn&#x27;t do it for me.  For one thing it didn&#x27;t grab the ends of my hair so my hair turned up not under.&lt;br /&gt;One good thing about this brush tho is it gives lots of volume.&lt;br /&gt;I think this brush may work better for someone who wants to style there hair straight.  Also I have shorter hair believe this brush is for medium to long hair.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality. Works fine but the heat is anything but hot. takes Forever to dry my hair with this and by the time it&#x27;s dry is it so frized out it&#x27;s barely worth it</li>
    <li> this brush is great!  i have medium length, wavy hair.  it gives it body and curls the ends. it looks smooth and healthy. no more flat iron and it&#x27;s super easy to use.  love it!</li>
    <li> Enjoying my hot air brush very much. The bristles are soft against the scalp. It makes the hair smooth and soft. I wish there was a smaller brush attachment for shorter hair. I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This brush gives lots of volume and polish to the hair but first I partially dry my hair with a regular hair dryer. Otherwise it would take too long if I just used this hot air brush.</li>
    <li> This is b y far the best purchase I ever made!&lt;br /&gt;My hair comes out with a professional shiny look.  I was using a dated hotbrush that was not doing the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  MBS</li>
    <li> Not a hairdresser I bought 3 for gifts ,I would like it to get hotter.</li>
    <li> Where have you been....wish it was dual.</li>
    <li> This brush could use a few improvements, especially when compared to others that I have used.  First, I agree with other users that the power/setting switch is oddly located in that it is sunk into the handle so it isn&#x27;t easy to just adjust the setting.  You actually have to stop what you are doing and look at the handle and make sure you have selected things properly.  Other brushes have a more textured button or one that comes out from the unit a bit so they are easier to slide.  Second, and perhaps most annoying for me personally, there is nowhere to \\&quot;anchor\\&quot; your other hand when you are holding the curl.  I hold the brush with my right hand, roll the curl, and then have to hold the very flat end of the brush when I am holding the curl and the end is not only uncomfortable, it gets hot!!  All curling irons and other blower brushes have a stump or cap that is cool for you to hold on to.  This one is realllly lacking that feature.  Last, the brush could get hotter and could have more power.  I have thick hair and it takes forever to get the curl to set, and again, I&#x27;ve had better luck with other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t buy this if you want curls, the barrel is quite large so it&#x27;s designed for a \\&quot;curve\\&quot; and body effect for medium to long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad product but I&#x27;m not in love either.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I like it, but if you have a thick hair as I do, it&#x60;s not so good, you are going to need a straightener to have a good style</li>
    <li> I just got this and used it for the first time today, and already I&#x27;m in love with it. My hair tends to frizz easily and ends up somewhere between curly and wavy once it&#x27;s dried, and  it&#x27;s not a good look at chin length so I like to wear it straight. I usually have to dry it and then repair it with a straightener, as I&#x27;ve never mastered the art of styling with a brush and dryer. The hot air brush was so easy to use and it cut my styling time in half, not to mention giving my hair volume I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve, and I can avoid the flattening affect at the top that results from the straightener. Great product for the price, as long as it lasts. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> ok used once and didn&#x27;t think it dried fast enough</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a nicely smoothed finish.</li>
    <li> This an easy to use airbrush. I thought it would rotate automatically but it does not. You have to rotate the brush.</li>
    <li> I would buy again. Works great and does not dry out hair.  Heat is moist and wand is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Too big, didn&#x27;t work well and Bristles too fat. Never used it after first attempt and put it out for charity pick  up.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Perfect for short hair.</li>
    <li> Like it, works for me ....specially for unmanageable hairs !</li>
    <li> I will have to order another one. I gave this one to my Mom. We both hate doing our own hair.... Just dampen clean hair with wet hands, run this through your hair and you have gorgeous hair!! Leaves hair shiny too!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m no good with hair and I can use it! It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite hot air brush I&#x27;ve owned.  Love that the bristles lightly grip your hair and works great on fine, thinner hair.  I wished it got just slightly hotter, but I&#x27;d take on the cooler side, rather than burner your head off.  Love the size of the barrel as well.  Gives my hair body and shine!! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Owned it for 9 months and used less than 2 doz times. Motor has apparently burned up. Tried to use and it smelled like electrical fire, now it will not come on at all. No more than it was used, it should have lasted longer. Apparently I don&#x27;t have a warranty. Wont replace with another of the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this  for awhile...first I thought it was a splurge, but do so appreciate the smooth, controlled look it gives my hair which is long and naturally wavy and many shade of gray. Works very well with a spritz of &amp;#34;Shine&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I feel like I can do almost as good of a job as my hairdresser does!</li>
    <li> Years ago I used a spin brushed and loved it, but my hair was always becoming tangled. This brush does not tangle my longish hair.  It styles and dries it.  I look like I just came from the salon. The styler takes longer to dry than my regular hair dryer.  I also make sure my hair has air dried for at least 20 minutes before using. This styler leaves hair bouncy and smooth.</li>
    <li> The Product was received promptly and  in great condition.  It was everything it was advertised to be and I am very happy with both the quality of the product as well as the excellent service I received.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush, I let my friend use it and she&#x27;s going to order one also. my hair is not extra thick but I got plenty of it this hot air brush grabs my hair great and curls it with a soft pretty finish</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for someone who had shoulder surgery.  She would not be able to use one arm for a few months.  This was the perfect solution for her short hairstyle.  Dries and styles using one hand.</li>
    <li> Bought my John Frieda Hot air brush from another company.  Its an amazing product that could be better for WOC natural hair.  Everything it says it does however I expected it to get my curly thick hair straighter than it did, surprisingly it went through my wet/damp leave-in conditioned curly hair easier than expected and gave me smooth voluminous big curls.  Even after 2 days these curls didn&#x27;t fall flat.  While using it I did notice the brushes bending (due to heat and thickness of hair), this item might not last as long as expected, but for the time being, the occasional length check and straightening of the hair this will do.  Still yet, I definitely prefer this over the blow dryer and brush,  so much easier to coordinate.  If your looking for a product that gives volume, and curl this is the perfect product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product would do a fine job but I need to use both hands to to pull thru my hair and that is not possible due to extremely hot on brush end...had to return.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about everything on my hair from products to appliances but nothing made the fullness last more than 15 minutes.  The first time I used this brush I was absolutely amazed!  It was easy to use, easy to grasp and my hair didn&#x27;t get tangled up in it.  I do use a regular hair dryer to get rid of most of the moisture then I apply my mousse and my hot air brush.  My hair stays bouncy all day!!  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the John Frieda Hot Air Brush.  It is lightweight and easy to handle, plus it works great with fine hair.  I only use it on my hair when it is damp because that is what I&#x27;ve always done with previous hot air brushes.  This is by far the best brush I have ever used on my hair, and the results are great!</li>
    <li> I just have never learned to properly blow dry my hair.  I bought round brushes, I tried to blow dry with the brushes and I just could not do it.  So I decided to buy this hot brush.  I used it for the first time last night.  I did not have a lot of time to do my hair so I did not get a chance to fully section it and do it the way I wanted, but in the limited time I had to use this item, it made my hair nicely styled and really really soft.  I cannot wait to actually have the time to do my hair the way it was meant to be done with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first blow dried my hair with a regular blow dryer until it was dampish, then I used this hot brush.  The ends have a nice curl to them and it was pretty simple to use.  I was undecided whether to buy this product or the one where the brush rotates.  I think it would be cool if this brush rotated, but you can just do that yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take time to do this, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this before work because I do not have the time, but when I do my hair at night or on weekends, I will definitely use this product and recommend it to others who have the same problem as me with blow drying their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will look up better ways to use this product, because I had no idea what I was doing and I got good results.  If I actually knew what I was doing I think my hair would be even better.  I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT*&lt;br /&gt;today is 4/9/14 and I just got to work after having used this brush last night, EVERYONE complimented my hair and they thought I just came from a salon.  I love this brush!!!!!  I think I just got my coworker to buy one.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Really wish it was dual-voltage for international travel. It&#x27;s great to take on trips as smaller than round brush + blowdryer.</li>
    <li> super easy to use, leaves my hair smooth without the damage of a flat iron&lt;br /&gt;blow drying leaves it &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34;, this leaves it straight and smooth&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;styles in less than half the time</li>
    <li> I am a busy mom and need tools to make getting ready quick. I asked for this for Mother&#x27;s Day and I LOVE it! I used to try to roll a brush and hold my dryer and unless you&#x27;re an octopus that is not quick nor easy. With this I just turn it on and dry and curl at the same time. So much easier!!! My hair doesn&#x27;t take curl or hold styles easily. I have a lot of stick straight, coarse hair. This works so well on the high heat setting. I am done in under 10 minutes. Just beware of going from the roots if you have a lot of hair as I made that mistake once and had to add product to tone down the football helmet effect. I like to use it about 4 inches up from my ends for a simple turn under or out depending on the day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it would replace my round brush and dryer.  It doesn&#x27;t - after using the JF Hot Air Brush my hair has no body, it doesn&#x27;t curl it under at all and it takes longer to dry than a conventional dryer.  I tried it on towel dried hair, hair that was about 70% dry and dry hair. I also tried styling products with it and have resorted to finishing with my flat iron to style my hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your money unless all you want is dry, stick straight hair with no body or curl.</li>
    <li> This has been a game-changer for my hair. I do not use it to dry my hair, but as a pseudo curling iron - it just makes my hair flip the right way, gives it body, and keeps it under control. I have wavy and somewhat fine hair that has a mind of its own, so this does the trick for me on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This was the first hot air brush that I purchased and immediately fell in love! It was much easier than using a round brush and blow dryer and this product did the trick. My hair looked like I had just stepped out of the salon after each use. The reason I gave it only 2 stars is because the item broke after a short time, and from what I understand, this is not uncommon. So instead of having to purchases new brush 2 or 3 times a year I opted for a different brand...I don&#x27;t like it as much as the John freida brush, but it gets the job done. Just wish they would fix the problem with this model.</li>
    <li> I tried 3 air brushes before and I like this one the most. It is easy to use and hair are straight and silky after it.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time this morning and loved it! The air brush is fairly light in weight. Even on the warmest setting my hair did not feel like it was being fried. I doubt I will ever use my  flat iron again! Best of all the end of the brush has been replaced with a rubber top so no more burning your fingers if you happen to grab it!</li>
    <li> Love it! Can&#x27;t live without it! I don&#x27;t use it everyday though.</li>
    <li> This is a really cool product.  I have heavy, wavy hair with some frizz and this brush/dryer allows me to dry my hair and keep its body.&lt;br /&gt;It also does a great job of smoothing the frizzies.  Not sure how it would work on different hair types but it is working well for me.</li>
    <li> Bought it for our guest bathroom for any guest that need it.</li>
    <li> Seriously? I bought this to shorten the time drying my hair. Not multiply it by 3. My hair is an inch longer than shoulder length.</li>
    <li> Thought the handle might be large and uncomfortable but it is not. Unit is lightweight,not too loud and does a beautiful job. After half drying my hair I use the hot air brush for an easy, salon style finish. Much better for my mid length bob than the separate brush and dryer method that never got the back looking right.</li>
    <li> Bristles of the brush not firm enough ...felt it was not brushing hair through...enough heat is good....feel the product suits fine textured hair more</li>
    <li> Started looking for reviews of another Hair Dryer/Straightener that I saw on TV when I came across this one in someones Youtube video. I watched her dry her hair at the scalp till it was damp, then plug in this John Frieda Hot Air Brush, and POOF, in a very short order, she was done and it looked FANTASTIC!&lt;br /&gt;Had to get me one!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon and John Frieda. Best purchase of the year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three things I would recommend that JF would improve on:&lt;br /&gt;1) Add some sort of non-slip texture to the handle (rubberized).&lt;br /&gt;2) Make the end where the brush is, just a bit longer/extended so you can grip it with your fingers better while rotating the unit in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;3) The switch could be rubberized or have a piece that sticks up just a tad, for better control of moving between settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this product!</li>
    <li> Like this curling brush,easy to use and makes styling a breeze. Definitely would recommend it to a friend or relative .</li>
    <li> I seriously can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. It is lightweight, easy to use, and makes styling my hair a breeze. It was so nice in fact that my mom even asked for one for Mother&#x27;s Day. Since she is getting older she was having trouble holding up heavy bulky hair dryers, so this has been wonderful for her. It is easy to use, and anyone can do it!</li>
    <li> I have three of these. One in each bathroom and one at work. I can get a good blow dry, next best thing to a professional blow out.</li>
    <li> This is finally the one! It is now my GO-TO dryer/styler for the worst of times!  If you&#x27;re worried that the dryer&#x27;s 500 watts won&#x27;t be sufficient for your hair, put whatever product you use for defrizzing, blow-drying serum/balm/oil, etc., and use this great-grabbing styling brush on your damp hair at the very end! C&#x27;est Parfait!</li>
    <li> no matter how you use it.  I have fine but thick hair.  it is the only tool that gives my hair body and lift.</li>
    <li> Love this curler.  Works perfect on my hair and I can fix my hair in no time before going to work in the Morning.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my first hair dryer brush. Although the curl in my hair is a little different than when I use a blow dryer and curling iron, I love it for travel. It&#x27;s easy to pack and use. It is definitely my go to travel item.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about how well this brush would work, but I was pleasantly surprised...it doesn&#x27;t get my hair perfectly straight, but is foes add volume, and my hair is soft and shiny after use. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> A GREAT dryer / styling tool. Your hair should be 3/4 dry before using. Truly smooths hair and it stays looking great. Be sure to use John Frieda volumizer products with it (they beat salon products in my opinion).</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product for the first month that I&#x27;ve used it.  but recently the motor in it goes on and off sporadically.  does anyone else have this problem?  and does anyone know what the removable plastic thing is that the cord is attached to?  I&#x27;ve removed it to find netting beneath it but I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t for me.  But good quality.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and it is very thick so this does not really work on me as it leaves the hair frizzy but I&#x27;m sure it works on people with finer hair so if that is your case then this product is for you</li>
    <li> This is much easier to use than a brush in one hand and a blow-dryer in the other.  It dries my hair quickly, and allows me to style it at the same time.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! I love how it leaves my hair. Really shiny and tame. Grant it I have to use the flattening iron afterwards but my other hot air brush never gave me the flare this one gives me. It really leaves my hair \\&quot;bouncy\\&quot;. The reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because it does not have a cool tip and this little guy can heat up pretty hot and my fingers don&#x27;t like that! Overall a very nice product. I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hot air brush.  I&#x27;ve used another product for years and am tired of having to replace it so often.  So, I decided to spend a little more and try this one...I&#x27;m worth it!  My biggest concern was if the bristles would grab my fine hair, or would it slip right out.  I works great.  I&#x27;m hoping they make one a little smaller so I can have two different sizes. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Even someone completely inept at doing her own hair can make herself look great with this!  The swivel cord is great and does not get tangled, and I did not find the tip too hot as other reviewers did. Maybe they have fixed that problem already.</li>
    <li> The best thing that i have ever invested in for my hair. I have very thick wavy hair.  As I colour it it can tend to get dry, lack lustre and frizz. I have tried serums, oils etc to no avail but now i have the fantastic john frieda air brush! the secret is to rough dry your hair with a hair dryer (my hair turns out enormous) and then section it to use the air brush. The result is shiny smooth hair with volume and lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> This product is an essential and especially good for shorter hair (not pixie length).  Hair does not get tangled and you are able to get closer to the scalp for more body.  The price is perfect, too.</li>
    <li> The bristles were falling out the first time I used it.  I returned it.  I did like the brush itself and how it worked, but from other reviews I read, they had the same problem with the bristles falling out and wished they had returned it sooner as well.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Conair one, but returned that too as the tool has too much air power and just blew my hair around.&lt;br /&gt;The best one I&#x27;ve found is the &amp;#34;Hotstick&amp;#34; Ion hot air brush.  I bought the 1-1/2&amp;#34; as my hair is mostly shoulder length, and will buy the 1&amp;#34; or 3/4&amp;#34; (if they make one) soon, for the shorter hair on top.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up fast, smoothes the hair and the frizzies, and helps to finish drying and styling really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.  M.G. H.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this hair dryer doesn&#x27;t give off a lot of heat. I have short, thin hair and it still takes time to dry my hair. I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s to protect my hair. It is comfortable to hold and easy to use. I am satisfied. Now watch someone say it should be hotter and my hair dryer is defective!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the kind of person who styles my hair on a daily basis.  I own a blow dryer, a flat iron, hot rollers and two curling irons.  I wear makeup every day, but generally leave my hair to air dry or I&#x27;ll just pull it up.  I never look like I put much effort into my hair, pretty much, because I didn&#x27;t.  I bought this on a whim, to see what it would do.  It&#x27;s amazing!  Again, not skilled with styling, but I watch how my gal blow dries my hair with a round brush when I go in for a trim.  Now, I can do that myself.  I dry the underneath, then dry the top, and my hair actually looks styled, rather than just looking fuzzy when I use just a blow dryer.  It&#x27;s easy to use the swivel cord is great, I&#x27;ve never burned myself on any part of it, and it&#x27;s much quieter than I expected. I wish I had bought something like this sooner, I&#x27;m excited by how polished I can look in so little time.  I love it and I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> I had tried a brush hair dryer ages ago and didn&#x27;t like it.  I have chin length fine hair ( a lot of hair strands but very fine strands), with a tiny bit of wave.  This dryer is SO much easier than using a dryer and round brush, and the results are much smoother.  I&#x27;m buying a second one for my weekend home.</li>
    <li> I saw this in Oprah&#x27;s magazine and looked like it would work better for me than a round brush and a regular dryer.  Turns out it was even better than I could have hoped!  This is super-easy to use, and - since I have thick hair - it&#x27;s so much easier than a brush and dryer because I can use my *other* hand to place and hold the hair as needed. (Sectioning off as I go, but that&#x27;s not a problem.)  I loved it instantly - what a fantastic product/idea!  (P.S. I saw a similar dryer brush - not so sturdy-looking, tho&#x27; - from the same company at CVS for $60 ... so Amazon&#x27;s price here is very good.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried three styling brushes and hands down (or up!) this Hot Air Brush is the best! I have fine, frizzy, curly hair that looks salon done after using this brush ( I NEVER though I would say that)... the bristles are soft but firm (other brushes have had hard bristles that hurt my head), and the handle is easy to maneuver. I love that it has cool air and hot air...after most of a lifetime fighting the frizzies and unwanted (undirected) curls and waves, I CANNOT believe I FINALLY have found this hot air brush! The only thing I would change? Dual voltage for international travel! I want it with me always!!</li>
    <li> My first time using this kind of a product .&lt;br /&gt;Extremely easy to use . Came perfectly packaged .its a must have.</li>
    <li> I am not entirely thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to work with it some more and see if it is more so the user or of it is the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to rave about this product, but my hair is thinning &amp; short.  That being said, I can still use it along w/ my blow dryer, just creates more steps than I would like to have.  I think it would be perfect it my hair were thicker!</li>
    <li> Best styling tool I have used in years.  Gives salon blow dry results without needed eight arms!</li>
    <li> Smooths my wavy hair after blow drying.  Brushes are firm enough to get through my thick hair.  Very happy with this new brush hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Handles very easily - and love the sheen it leaves  on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This  hot brush  very easy handle !</li>
    <li> Works well and it is a good way to give your hair that special touch between regular blow dry work.</li>
    <li> Great buy, Was not sure if it would work on my short hair but it did!! It also gives it shine.</li>
    <li> I have very thick coarse hair, and this brush is awesome. MY HAIR DRYS IN 10 MINUTES. The brush hair dryer styles my hair perfect and is a snap. 5 STARS[[ASIN:B0056GDG90 John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush, 1.5 inch]]</li>
    <li> I like this product because the bristles are stiffer than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; product that allows it to hold my very fine (ugly) hair. Love this and would reccomend, especially for folks like me w/fine/short hair unable to hold my hands above my shoulders for very long. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have to say I never write a review.  I just got this brush and used it this morning.  I have short hair and was not sure if it would work that well.  I was WRONG!!!  I have a store of brushes, curling irons...etc.  I have tried them all.  This is the BEST I have ever used.  It cut the time in half.  It is so simple I actually used it when wet and it styled beautifully.  I would recommend this 100%.  I read the reviews and thought I really hope what they said was true, it was.  Really glad I got this very satisfied with this wonderful styling brush!!</li>
    <li> I am female, average size hands and this dryer/curler is a little hard for me to hold and turn.  I know they have to get all that wiring in the handle and do not want to disparage product.  This is my only complaint.  I fina;y got tired of looking shaggy because I just cannot do the two handed brush/dryer thing and did not want to just cut all my hair off.  I bought this to see if I really would use it (that is, if it is easy to use and effective) and I do!!  Not too hot for my fine hair and the curl is a good size (would be GREAT to hava a 1 inch tho).  Only issue is with large handle.  Perhaps a textured grip of some sort might help.  Otherwise good product; I like everything I have ever bought from John Freida.</li>
    <li> I love the brush and it works very well. It would be nice if it had a lower heat setting, not just a lower blower setting. The high heat setting is very hot and I am always afraid I am damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> UPDATE.&lt;br /&gt;I originally gave the brush 5 stars, I knocked it down to three because I purchased the first one on March 21, 2013, and it stopped making heat about a week before thanksgiving, that was just barely 7 months. I don&#x27;t know why I thought I could put any faith into a conair product. I&#x27;ll probably be contacting the company, but I am officially done with conair.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really skeptical about buying this brush, While it&#x27;s marketed via john Frieda it&#x27;s produced by conair...and a few years ago I ran into a big issue with conair&#x27;s quality (I went through four $50 dollar infiniti air brushes in a year) and pretty much wrote the company off as garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve purchased two of these and not because the original one is broken! My mother loved using my hot air brush and eventually had me order her one, and now I&#x27;m here to order one for my sister as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally I have wavy curly hair right from root to tip, while I like it, it get&#x27;s messy way too easily. I&#x27;ve had this hot air brush for less than a year and it&#x27;s lifespan is seems to be really holding up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large round barrel straightens my hair, gives it body and adds the perfect amount of curl at the ends. The large barrel also lets me pick up slightly bigger chunks of hair, I have below shoulder length hair and A LOT of it, doing my hair in one inch sections is not an option. As far as the Ion technology, not super sold on it, I don&#x27;t notice it being any shinier from Ions compared to when I used to use my old round brush or the even infiniti brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is waiting for my hair to be the perfect dampness, I find that I can&#x27;t go into using the air brush with super wet hair as it takes way too long because the brush just doesn&#x27;t have the air flow of a normal blow dryer And it can&#x27;t be too dry either or I notice I get little waves where it just didn&#x27;t take as well. it kind of has to be at that perfect spot, I believe the instruction booklet said 80-90% dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush doesn&#x27;t leave the tell tale signs of using a straightener, like leaving that weird mark near your scalp, or scalding your ends to where they look dry, infact a new friend of mine only just recently saw me without my hair done, she had no idea I had naturally curly hair, She insisted she could ALWAYS spot someone who straightens their hair. I think it killed her that I snuck right under her radar &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been letting my curly, thick hair grow longer this past year. ( now about shoulder length ) and  also letting my colorist allow it to be much lighter.  My hair is very unruly in humidity, although when blown straight by a professional, will usually retain body, and stay under control.  Thus far I&#x27;ve been unable to attain these results with my own blow drying efforts.  Enter this John Frieda hot Air brush.  Unlike my old, 15 year old contraption that I found in the bottom of my drawer, this brush is sleek, and allows for consistent, easy drying and curling. My hair looks like I&#x27;ve just stepped out of the salon.  it pulls easily through my hair, and allows for curling the ends. After wash, dry, and condition, I let my hair air dry for about 1/2 hour, then dried with the hot air brush in small sections.  results are smooth, non frizzy, healthy looking hair.  I&#x27;m really thrilled.  Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> On day 2+  of my blow out, I need to touch up this and that and this tool is perfect.  Hair can only be damp, not wet from the shower as the blower is not powerful enough to do wet hair.  As long as you use it for the intended purpose, you will be pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a good hot air brush but does take longer to dry your hair due to the lower 500 watt. However, that is better for your hair in the long run.</li>
    <li> WOW!  What can I say.  This product is awesome!!!  I have curly hair and have been straightening it for a while now but using tons of  oils, keratin products, leave in conditioners etc. along with a straightener which seems to be creating a little bit of the frizzes and split ends.  When i set out to search for a product to help my hair,  I came across this.  Not only is this product amazing, but it makes my hair feel silky and soft while making it look shiny and straight and perfect.  I don&#x27;t need to use any flat irons anymore, or any of the products that i was putting in my hair.  I simply shampoo and condition my hair and dry it with this and like magic, my hair looks like i just came from the salon.  Thank you John Freida for making an amazing product that I know I can count on to make my hair look simply amazing!  This is a definite must for anyone.  Although not too powerful, which allows for more heat on hair time, it does the job perfect and i would gladly recommend this to anyone!!!  This is an &amp;#34;A Plus&amp;#34; product!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair tool!!  It works great. I have long thick hair that has lots of layers and this helps me get all those layers curled and dried with minimal frizz and it provides body. But the key to this working if you have thick hair is to make sure you dry it about 90% done or it will take forever to get it dry with this alone, not to mention your arm will grow very tired. I use a mousse after getting out of the shower and a frizz defying serum on the ends before I start then finish with a glossing /holding spray. Looks almost like you just stepped out of a salon. Also I noticed my hair stays looking good for several days after I use it.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly,fine, frizzy hair that is also damaged from years of coloring and straightening. I bought this in hopes of being able to find a better way to get smooth hair without frying it every day with a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use if you know how to use a roundbrush (and easy to pick up on if not).&lt;br /&gt;-not too hot. Some people in their reviews considered this a CON, but because I am trying to not damage my hair I appreciate that it doesnt get too hot yet still does the job.&lt;br /&gt;-light&lt;br /&gt;-long cord&lt;br /&gt;-very soft&lt;br /&gt;-quiet (ALOT quieter than a blow dryer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-hard to reach roots&lt;br /&gt;-you must go over the hair about 4 times in order to remove frizz (for hair like mine)&lt;br /&gt;-struggles with bangs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering I put my hair in a towel to dry for 5 minutes, then let it air dry for 20 before using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;It then took 20 minutes for me to pretty much finish drying my hair and style it with the brush. Then 5 minutes of touching up my bangs and roots with an iron. I like the way it turned out!</li>
    <li> This us wonderful. I thought it was revolving but it wasn&#x27;t. It leaves hair smooth and shiny. Is there a smaller barreled version?</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I ever made. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve been able to blow dry my hair and have it look great.  It&#x27;s fast and easy.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great. just dont go bald. it will be useless</li>
    <li> I have used this newly purchased hot air brush about a month and love it.  It works great and replaced a very old conair that had brush attachments and was larger.  The new Air Bursh is lighter and easier to handle and it may take a bit longer to dry my hair since I have a lot of hair but the results are great.  I use in conjunction with the John Frieda Frizze Ease Heat protective Spray and my hair looks healthier.  Would recommend this to anyone that likes brush dryers.</li>
    <li> It makes my fine thin hair looking more fuller, especially the ends don&#x27;t have the frizzy look.</li>
    <li> Wow.....I just got this and tried it on my 80% dry hair.  I have long and very thick hair.  I looked like I had a professional blowout!  It&#x27;s not super fast, but seems like so much less work than a round brush and dryer.  The best part is working on the &#x27;tough&#x27; parts like the back.....it grips your hair without pulling it, so makes it super easy to style those areas.  Cool shot setting is great for &#x27;setting&#x27; any curl you put in...</li>
    <li> I really like this hot air brush, gives my hair that professional salon blow-out look.  Wish it was a bit stronger tho, but it works good.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wish it had a little more power. First I dry my hair with regular dryer, then use John Frieda for finishing touches. Overall results are satisfying. :-)</li>
    <li> This is the first  product of this type that I have ever been comfortable using.  I have wavy and frizzy hair and I can smooth my hair with out a lot of  effort.  It is much easier than having a brush in one hand and a hair dryer in the other.  It is best to dry your hair about half way before using the brush.</li>
    <li> Love the product the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about it was that the brush didn&#x27;t turn on it.  I didn&#x27;t research it before purchasing so not the manufacturer fault.</li>
    <li> This is the NEXT BEST thing after a professional stylist. I have gotten SO MANY compliments on my hair. &amp;#34;Did you just get your hair done?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Can I have your stylist&#x27;s number?&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t even blow dry my hair and I&#x27;ve got thick horse hair! As soon as I get out of the shower; put on whatever little product in my hair and use this Hot Air brush; and I&#x27;m set! I&#x27;m clumsy and have no co-ordination whatsoever; So, I can&#x27;t hold a roller brush and a blow dryer and try to do my hair. This ALL IN ONE is PHENOMENAL!!! I LOVE It and I have ordered 8 so far for friends who want hair like mine. I have three of these just incase one dies or I&#x27;m traveling and I leave it at the hotel by accident. I RELY ON THIS EVERYDAY. This product is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have looked for a replacement to a styling tool that I have had way too long because I couldn&#x27;t find it&#x27;s equal. I am thrilled with this find and I&#x27;m waiting to buy at least one more as soon as it is back in stock. This has made my year!</li>
    <li> I love this thing and have no regrets at all for purchasing it! I was always very clumsy with a round brush, but this has solved my problems!</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty thin and somewhat wavy (mostly frizzy). I&#x27;ve never been able to blow my hair straight with a blow dryer. Prior to purchasing this brush, if I wanted to wear my hair down, I needed to blow dry and then flat iron. Because flat ironing is so damaging to my hair and the entire process takes so long, I mostly wore my hair up. That is not a very good look for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I purchased the Hot Air Brush six months ago, I&#x27;ve been using it regularly and wearing my hair down all the time. I have received a ton of compliments on my hair, and I have been getting the same questions over and over: Did you get a haircut? Did you dye your hair? No and no. I just finally learned to style it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone with frizzy hair, this brush is the difference between looking hot and looking like a hot mess.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this at all. I used it once and never picked it up again  it wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
    <li> After trying another brand 3 times and having the barrel fall off and crack, I finally decided to switch brands. This John Frieda is perfect. The large barrel is completely attached so no more falling off. Although I still use a conventional blow dryer to get my hair mostly dry, the air flow on this product is great. I love the bristle brush that holds into my hair easily without tangling. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Have used the John Frieda Salon Shape hot air brush a few months now and really like it.  The large 1.5 inch barrel adds volume without curls (the look I prefer).  My hair tends to friz, especially during the humid months, but this dryer keeps it smooth.  Would prefer 3 heat settings - low, medium, and high - but can live with 2.  Make sure your hair is just damp or will take a long time to dry.  Often I will shower at night and go to bed with a wet head, which means I resemble a &amp;#34;geriatric Shirley Temple&amp;#34; in the morning.  Using a small spray bottle of water, I mist and dry a section of hair at a time - this process easily replaces friz and adds shine.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Perfect size for med long hair. So far very happy with it. If it was self rotating it would be perfect! Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars as you do have to dry your hair at least 90% before using it as a styler.</li>
    <li> Before ordering, I had my doubts.  I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would work, but I figured that for around $30, it was worth a shot.  My first impression when I unpacked the item was that there were hardly any bristles.  Deciding that I shouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;knock it until I try it,&amp;#34; I washed my hair and let it airdry for about 10 minutes.  I have shoulder blade length hair.  It is very thin and frizzes when it&#x27;s not styled.  Due to the years of styling damage done to my hair, it&#x27;s lost its natural curl in several places, leaving it wavy or really straight wherever it&#x27;s not still curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was almost dry around my face, and everywhere else it was still pretty wet.  I just couldn&#x27;t wait to try it any longer.  I started around my face, and immediately noticed that it was, indeed, working.  I started at the root of my hair and continuously turned the hot airbrush while pulling it through my hair.  When I would get to the ends, I would roll my hair back up and slowly pull the brush back to the ends. I ended up with a voluminous style, something I&#x27;ve always wanted but have never been able to achieve.  I could even see where my layers were cut, and the style looked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically blow dry my hair with my high dollar (Chi) blowdryer and flat iron.  I can honestly say that my hair was just as shiny using this item, and it was softer! I never want to blowdry and flat iron my hair again.  This item allowed me to style my own hair and make it look like I had just gotten it professionally blowdryed...and it took a fraction of the time that I usually spend with a blowdryer and flat iron.  I also loved that my hair never got tangled with the brush while doing this.  I, at first, considered a hot airbrush that would spin, but since you&#x27;ve got both hands to work with (since you&#x27;re not having to hold a blowdryer too), turning this hot airbrush is not at all difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t discover this item sooner! The one concern that I do have is that the bristles won&#x27;t outlive the motor of this hot airbrush, since there don&#x27;t seem to be a lot them.  Only time will tell, but if that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;ll gladly order another one.</li>
    <li> I tried this with dry hair, wet hair, and then damp hair and it made no difference to my hair.  I bought this based on other reviews and was so disappointed that it did not work on my thick, wavy hair.  I have a flat iron which works great but I sometimes burn myself and was hoping this would be a nice alternative.  It is not.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush! It allows me to style my medium length hair with one hand . It gives me body and loose curls. I do small sections starting with hair that is 80% dry. I begin with 10 seconds on hot and then another 10 seconds on warm to set the section and move on to the next. No more blow dryer and brush styling for me.</li>
    <li> This brush has made my life so much easier and has given me an extra 15 minutes of sleep in the morning! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Right after my shower, I&#x27;d dry my hair quickly with a regular dryer for 5 minutes. Afterwards, I&#x27;d have my coffee,&lt;br /&gt;get dressed and put on some make up. By then, my hair will be barely damp and ready for the JF Hot Air Brush.&lt;br /&gt;And in 5-10 minutes I&#x27;m ready! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer pointed out, this hot air brush gives you the &amp;#34;I care look,&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s so true! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit hesitant to buy it at first, since I&#x27;ve tried similar ones, but was never totally pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have one JF Hot Air Brush at home and another one at the beach house, so I don&#x27;t need to pack it every time&lt;br /&gt;I go the beach.</li>
    <li> My old hot air brush quit on me and I could no longer find that model to replace it. After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this one. I&#x27;m very pleased with it, the weight is manageable and the bristles are great on my hair. I recommend this hot air blower!</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this after watching a woman use it in a YouTube video. It&#x27;s a great option for those (like me) who aren&#x27;t skilled with using a round brush and handheld blow dryer simultaneously. It gets very warm, but not hot like regular blow dryer, thus the four-star rating. As a result, it usually takes quite a few passes on my sectioned, semi-coarse, mid-length hair to get it fully dry---And the sections are small. :-/</li>
    <li> Great product!  Leaves my hair very soft and does add body to my fine, straight hair.</li>
    <li> I bought because it&#x27;s horrible trying to use a blow dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other, I thought this was a good alternative. Although it does not have a lot of power ( I dry my hair about 90% of the way prior to using this brush) it does make getting volumn a lot easier. It&#x27;s not super volumn but enough to make a difference.</li>
    <li> This will be great for when my hair grows longer; it&#x27;s too short. In order to use it, you should at least have shoulder length hair, I&#x27;m keeping it because it is a great product, but just note that the barrel is as large as an extra large hair roller.</li>
    <li> blow dry your hair about 80% and then use the air brush. It has cut my drying time dramatically and my hair has never been smoother (I have VERY wavey hair) or fuller. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several friends.</li>
    <li> It dries my shoulder-length hair quickly, and gives great body.  The bristles do not tangle my fine hair.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It not only works easily and effortlessly, but my hair never looked so good. I&#x27;m so happy and excited with it that I look forward to the day I wash my hair! Think I&#x27;ll buy another one NOW just in case some day it&#x27;s not available. Truly, it&#x27;s that good! Don&#x27;t waste a moment getting one. The first day I used it, it was a hot and windy day and I had a million errands to run. The style held all day - and I got compliments at an evening function I went to. Doesn&#x27;t get better than that! John Frieda, I love your products and thank you for not ripping us off cost wise!</li>
    <li> It is really an amazing tool. I also use Philip&#x27;s similar tool but totally can not get the same result.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to give this a try.  I must say that it&#x27;s taken me several tries to get the hang of it.  I do like it though and think that the more comfortable I get, the more I&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this!  I have previously been using a Revlon &amp;#34;curling brush&amp;#34; which meant I had to almost totally blow dry my hair first.  But I still had some fuzziness from the blow drying.  I have fine, thinning hair so I can towel dry and then use this to dry and shape my hair gently. I never could get the hang of the big round brush in one hand and the blow dryer in the other.  This is a home run!!</li>
    <li> Have always used a blow dryer and round brush, but this combo is GREAT! My boss told me about is, as she uses one too and has very curly hair. It makes her hair so smooth and full. My hair is much thinner, but works nice on mine too. The humidity just kills my hair in the summer. This brush makes it smoother and helps with the frizz. It&#x27;s such a good price too. I&#x27;m sold.....lol</li>
    <li> This works great and is easy to use. I&#x27;m afriacn american with natural hair.</li>
    <li> handle could be smaller hard to handle .</li>
    <li> It had reduced my styling time considerably.</li>
    <li> So let me start with...I know nothing about hair. I usually blow dry and leave the house a big frizz mess. The Hot Air Brush makes me look like I have gotten a salon style blowout. It&#x27;s easy to use, it&#x27;s got a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; option, it swivels really easily, my hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled..it is amazing. I usually spray my hair with some heat activated styling spray to protect it, then section my somewhat blow dried already hair, and curl my hair around the brush let it sit on the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; option, then &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; then spin it around to catch all the split ends and continue. My best friend was quite impressed with my new do, she thought I had it done professionally. For a girl who doesn&#x27;t spend much time on my hair in general, I am truly impressed by the ease of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Make sure your hair is close to dry, esp. at the roots before using product.</li>
    <li> She said it was absolutely terrible.  She said it didn&#x27;t really even work, and it made her hair frizzy.  She would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough for my slightly wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I love this curler/dryer/shiner all in one more than I thought! It is wonderful! My hair is shiny and wavy. I use it on my hair straight out of the shower after I towel dry it and add pureology mousse and spray protector. I love how it makes my hair look and feel!</li>
    <li> This is an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; product. &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; meaning that unless your hair is THIN and 90% dry don&#x27;t bother using this. I have thin lifeless hair and I purchased this in hopes that it would tame the flyaways and give me some volume. I could do just as good of a job with my hair with a blow dryer- in a shorter amount of time. I use this product maybe once every 2-3 weeks- I purchased it to make it part of my daily routine but it is time consuming because it isn&#x27;t powerful enough to work quickly, and it really doesn&#x27;t leave me impressed. I would like this product much more if it had more power (and if it was available with a bigger barrel)</li>
    <li> Easy to use and quick.  Going to get rid of my curlers!</li>
    <li> After using this for the first time, I walked out of the bathroom and my boyfriend told me it looked like I had just stepped off the runway!  Perfect model hair after running this through your locks for 10-15 minutes.  At first I was frustrated that you have to move the switch to the second-to-last click to get the hottest setting, but then realized that it&#x27;s actually convenient to have the last click be the cold setting, because it helps set the curl - so going back and forth between hottest and cold is actually convenient.  I would recommend this product for women on a budget, who still like to have fabulous waves in their hair.  It probably works best on long hair, and with some leave-in conditioner and shine serum if you are prone to frizz (and to minimize heat damage).  For those who only wash their hair every 2-3 days, the style lasts overnight fairly well, with just a few touch-ups in the morning.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me and it is going back. It  might work for someone with more body - my hair is baby fine.  This did NOTHING.</li>
    <li> I love this John Frieda Hot Air Brush! This is the first blowdryer brush thing i have used. I had been straightening my hair for a long time but i didn&#x27;t want to keep doing bad damage to my hair. I thought this would be a great alternative and it really is! My hair is shinier and has tons more volume! Im very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this hot air brush! It gives a great blow-dried look without going to the salon. It may take some time to get used to, but it&#x27;s definitely easier than manually using a hair dryer and brush. It&#x27;s not wireless, but the cord is long enough maneuver without stress. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little loud, but it&#x27;s no reason to skip it.</li>
    <li> I love it love it!!! I have gotten so many compliments on my smooth silky looking hair and it&#x27;s because of this awesome product!</li>
    <li> Really like this brush  so easy to use without getting burned and not getting tangled around cord. Great brush hair looks healthy after using it</li>
    <li> I used my John Frieda Hot Air Brush for the first time yesterday.  I am over the moon with this product.  My hair looks so smooth and shiny and feels the same way.  I could do an infomercial for this thing, I tell you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: very light weight. My arm doesn&#x27;t get tired trying to style my hair&lt;br /&gt;  easy to use.  Just brush through slowly and turn under (or over) at the end to style&lt;br /&gt;  Hair looks great.  It feels smooth and soft and looks very shiny and &amp;uuml;ber healthy. Like a hair commercial!!&lt;br /&gt;  Takes the place of brushes and blow dryer. This will be easy to travel with!&lt;br /&gt;  If you wake up w/ bedhead (clean but &amp;#34;bent&amp;#34; hair) use this brush and it will style quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: If you have very short hair it may not work as the brush itself is pretty big around. I have short/medium and it works fine,&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s not as fast drying as a blow dryer and brush. I let my hair semi air dry first so it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best things I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time. It exceeded my expectations. **Tossing my head and watching my hair sway and fall beautifully into place like on the television shampoo ads**</li>
    <li> Another fine produce my wife ordered via my 1-click Amazon account.  I know she likes it, because she uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush by mistake because I was looking for the hairdryer with rotating brush. Anyway I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product. My hears are not long, a little shorter than shoulder line. I bought 1.5 inch brush but the smaller one would work even better on a short hear.  Is has a long cord witch is really convenient. It&#x27;s light and really easy to use. I definitely spent 5-7 min less on my hear every morning.</li>
    <li> Two weeks that I bought it and now it turns off with in the first 2 minutes of use and I have to wait like 30 minutes to use it again I do not recommen</li>
    <li> I  have fine and long hair.  I usually dry my hair in a minute !  This product is easy on your hair but even at the high setting this takes for ever.  I say easy because it does not get too hot  and hair do not get tangled in the brush (like the ceramix i had before).  For sure the health of my hair could benefit from this brush but I do not have the patience.  Even if I dry them 75 % with the regular dryer it still too demanding.  Result is not bad althought the 1.5 inches does not get my hair curly even if i roll the brush (the ceramix did the trick).  Unfortunately this brush lacks power and I ordered another one more powerful.  Also note the high setting easily moves to the cold one when manipulating the brush.  This gets a bit annoying.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like blow drying my hair usually, but some days I have to. I have very dry hair and blow drying makes it worse. I like how this does not whip my hair (and my face) around with harsh hot air. It has made the whole experience of drying my hair soooo much better. I will definitely be using this more often then I used my blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my hair feel even softer and gives me more fullness. I have long thin hair and am amazed at how quickly this does dry and style my hair when I&#x27;m rushing around in the morning! Only thing I would prefer is that the barrel of the brush not be quite as wide which would make it easier to roll to create curl. This is a bit wide for my hands. But I love the way my hair turns out when I use this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I do partially dry my hair with a regular blow dryer.  Then I separate the hair and dry pieces - adds a lot of volume!!!  So happy I saw this in REal Simple magazine and bought it!</li>
    <li> This is great, easy way to vamp your hair. It really smoothes fly-aways and gives your hair a really polished look. Your hair has to be pretty dry before using it (I often blow-dry for a minute before using the hot air brush), but using two blow drying tools is a small price to pay for the great results.</li>
    <li> No want I wanted very unhappy with it it does not a thing for my hair! Does not bend hair under to just to style a bob hair cut</li>
    <li> I have curly not kinky hair which is fine as well.  This is a great product to refresh already dry hair but I have not done as well with drying my hair from wet with it.  Overall, a good product but I see it as an adjunct to my brushes and blow dryer, not a replacement.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome hair styling tool.  I am really not good at two hand hair blow drying.  This product has combined the two functions and it is so light and easy to use!  The bristle really grabs the hair so it is like a nice premium hair brush.</li>
    <li> This drying brush makes styling and drying hair so easy.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves hair soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is ok for people with thinner or straighter hair.  If your hair is coarse or thick I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s powerful enough.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase the John Frieda Hot Air Brush after first seeing an ad for it in Cosmo, and then reading all of the fabulous reviews for it here on Amazon. I absolutely love this brush. It has greatly shortened my hair-doing process, and the results are seriously amazing. I have frizzy, overworked, kind-of curly, long hair. My usual process used to include first blowing my hair dry, then painstakingly straightening it, section by section. Because this process was pretty time consuming, I would usually blow dry at night, and straighten in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Hot Air Brush, I simply blow dry in three sections, and walk out the door. The finish that this brush gives to hair is bouncy, light, and shiny. Also, like many of the other girls on here, I have to say that achieving cute, bouncy end-of-the-hair curls is a breeze with this tool. I keep getting compliments on how nice my hair looks, and I am thrilled with how much less time I am spending on my hair. Also, I am sure that not using my straightener is much better for my hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies- this tool is worth the $40, and it ships quick. Do yourself *and your hair* a favor and pick up this fabulous brush!</li>
    <li> I was super excited to try this because (1) I&#x27;m always looking for ways to battle frizzy hair, and (2) I generally love everything John Frieda. I was very disappointed in this product. It really didn&#x27;t work any better than a traditional hair dryer and brush. My hair wasn&#x27;t noticeably less frizzy nor shinier. But, I&#x27;m still giving this product 3 stars because I think its functionality depends on your hair type. My long and thick hair was just too much for this product to handle - even with drying it with a hair dryer first and sectioning it off. If you have short/thin hair, I&#x27;d probably recommend this product. But anyone with long/thick hair should probably look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews, i decided to give it a try.  I finally received the brush today and was very excited about trying it out.  I had high hopes, but I also had reservations.  Amazingly, the brush worked better than I had ever expected it to.  It was really easy to use.  I got nearly salon-quality style with 0 frizz.  For the first time ever, blowdrying was effortless and quick.  I love, love, love this tool!</li>
    <li> The John Frieda Hot Air Brush was just the implement I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;It is light weight, easy to handle and does not get excessively hot.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dried and styled in half the time now.  I love it! And&lt;br /&gt;the price is much better than others I looked at.&lt;br /&gt;Karlynn Sharpe</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this brush! I have baby fine hair and it still took a long time to dry my short hair. Gave it to a friend. She doesn&#x27;t like it either. Just money blown.</li>
    <li> The brush does everything I expected.  I like the way it fits my hand and the weight is perfect.  I am very satisfied with the quality also.</li>
    <li> Great for thin frizzy hair, my hair is very fragile and the brush doesn&#x27;t pull it at all. I love it!!! Goodbye bulky hair dryers and round brushes! Best purchase ever made, don&#x27;t even need to put anything on my hair, is smooth shinny and no flyaway&#x27;s, I love that I can pull my hair back and smooth the ponytail and make it look like I spent a lot of time making it look good.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length wavy hair and for years have struggled with a blow dryer and round brush every morning.  No more!  This hot air brush gives me salon quality results in less time.  I used a regular blow dryer to get it 80% dry then finish with the hot air brush.  Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> Not happy with product.  It blew up within the first 3 minutes of using.  I am very disappointed and I don&#x27;t know how to return it.  It could of been a great styler if it worked.</li>
    <li> Product is efficient and I like the way it functions as a hair dryer and styles your hair all in one. Positive reviews I read prior to purchasing this product proved to be true. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> At long last I can finally get a salon-type result at home, despite being uncoordinated with a dryer/brush. My hair is fine in texture, but thick in quantity, and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I apply argan oil serum to protect my hair, then I hit it with a regular hair dryer for a couple of minutes just to speed up the process. I use clips to section my hair, then I dry each section (starting from the bottom and working up) with this wonderful hot air brush, combing thru a few times to get maximum shine and smoothness. I&#x27;m able to use the brush to get great volume on the top of my head by simply holding the brush in place next to my scalp for a few extra seconds before sliding the brush through. The whole process is very quick, even for my mid-back length hair. The end result is smooth, shiny, and tangle-free. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend all that extra money on an InStyler. No way could it be better enough to warrant that expense.</li>
    <li> The John Frieda hot air brush does a good job on my straight, fine hair.  It tames it into place so easily!</li>
    <li> I bought this hot air brush on a recommendation from a friend.  I think it is wonderful! It is the first hot air brush I have tried and I think it is the most wonderful appliance I have. My hair is short and could really use a smaller brush,but I love this one. It gets very hot for the wattage it has. I would recommend this brush to everyone.  Thanks John Frieda for making such a useful appliance and thank you Amazon for the great price.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Don&#x27;t have to hold a round brush and dryer at the same time.  I just love it!</li>
    <li> Probably the best hot air brush I&#x27;ve used.  Would have given it 5 stars but it could use a \\&quot;knob\\&quot; at the end of the brush for a place to put your other hand while curling your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this Air Brush. I am very particular about the hair dryers I use. Mine that I had purchased from a beauty supply store, quite. I was disappointed because it hadn&#x27;t lasted very long for the price. Read the reviews on Amazon and found this one. It is awesome. My hair is so smooth and shiny. I have very curly hair so it is hard to smooth. This does a great job. It isn&#x27;t a very hot dryer so it takes a little longer but I am sure it is better for me hair.</li>
    <li> It really does make a difference both in chasing the frizzies and creating a smoother finish. The John Frieda Hot Air Brush is a great find!</li>
    <li> This hot air brush is perfect.  It takes the frizz and static out of my hair and leaves it shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I have received many, many compliments since I started using the hot air brush.  My husband says many times that my hair never looked as good as it does since I have used the brush.  I have recommended the brush to many friends, even my beautician.</li>
    <li> This is the best styling brush I&#x27;ve every used.  It is easy to control and gave me the results I wanted.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Initially, I loved this air brush but unfortunately it only lasted 5 months before it stopped working. Very disappointing...</li>
    <li> If I was able to leave 4.8 stars, I would do so.  I did not purchase this hot air brush from Amazon but really felt a need to write a review.  I have been using this &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of hot air brush for years and needed a new one.  I checked the reviews here in trying to decide between this particular one and another brand that &amp;#34;rotates.&amp;#34;  I settled on this one and I can&#x27;t be happier!  The bristles actually grab the hair (unlike my old one where the bristles were so short) and it literally leaves my hair shiny and smooth, unlike my old one which left my hair frizzy, necessitating the use of a curling iron and then a flat iron.  I have also recently changed hair-care styling products and between those and this brush....I am able to clean out my closet of unneeded items like the curling iron and flat iron.  Awesome!  The reason I give it a 4.8 is that during styling I tend to need to hold onto the flat, top end of the brush with my other hand in order to rotate it during styling, and there isn&#x27;t really much to grab onto it with since it is pretty flush with the bristles and that flat end does tend to get a bit hot.  I&#x27;d LOVE it if it had just about an extra quarter or half inch or so beyond the bristles to be able to work easier with it...maybe like a small &amp;#34;knob&amp;#34; or something on that top end.  However...it&#x27;s definitely not a deal breaker.  I love this brush!</li>
    <li> I did not dry my medium length hair in a reasonable amount of time.  I did notice that my hair was less frizzy even though it did not add volume as expected.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how amazing and shiny my hair is after using this product. My hair is soft and looks like it was done by a professional hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;The two little disappointments were the fact that it takes a long time to do it when your hair is soaked coming out of the shower thus it doesn&#x27;t completely replaces the hairdryer and the brush does not rotate. Just need to quickly blow dry my hair before and its perfect!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this if you have curly hair susceptible to frizziness; is a good substitute for drying your hair with a brush and hair dryer, but doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair in one step; wish it had brush attachments</li>
    <li> Wish it would get a little hotter.</li>
    <li> Worked for me. It is delicate with my hair. However, my hair is straight and with this brush it is easy to give it the salon look! My mom is another story. Her hair is frizzy and this did not work for her at all! But if you hair is somewhat straight it will work, I even use it while watching tv with no mirrors around. It is THAT easy to use!!</li>
    <li> Excellent air brush - dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t tangle or pull my thinning hair, comfortable grip doesn&#x27;t make my hand cramp like a brush and blow dryer does! This one does not seem to get as hot as my Revlon air brush, but that&#x27;s a good thing since the Revlon with the aluminum surface would burn my scalp and hair on the high setting (yes, it smoked). Do your hair a favor and get a microfiber towel just for drying your hair after washing. They soak up more water than a bath towel and decrease the drying time and damaging heat. Press and squeeze, don&#x27;t rub, then apply good leave-in conditioner/heat protector. Use a regular dryer to get the hair about 3/4 dry, then style and finish with the air brush. The ceramic coating makes my hair smooth without burning and the brushes didn&#x27;t pull or tangle my hair. Great brush for a medium length bob - would be perfect if it had a 2&amp;#34; barrel option!</li>
    <li> The simple ease of using this product plus the fact that it does the job quickly and without frizz gives John Frieda&#x27;s hot air brush the highest rating.  The price is right too.  Buy it!  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I am now on hot air brush number 3.  I feel like Goldilocks.  The first one I purchased, suggested by my stylist was Hot Tools 1000 Watt 1 1/2 Inch Anti-Static Ionic Hot Air Brush.  I liked it, but it died prematurely, and after reading reviews on Amazon, this appeared to be a common complaint, so I looked for a different product to replace it.  I chose the John Frieda, based on Amazon reviews, unsatisfied, I have now purchased a Revlon product, but it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; either.  This review compares the John Frieda product to the others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have collar-length, naturally wavy/curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  The John Frieda brush feels sturdy in my hand (the Revlon brush feels &#x27;cheap&#x27; and vibrates excessively).  Easy to work with.  Has held up in traveling (the Hot Tools brush had damage to the plastic vent covers the very first time I took it on a trip)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  Bristles, my hair prefers the simpler bristles on the Hot Tools and Revlon products.  Power, this product only has 500watts (Hot Tools 1000w, Revlon 1200w), I use it on wet hair, so the bristles and power are not working for me.  Not &amp;#34;Ionic&amp;#34; my hair seems to respond better to the ionic brushes (both Hot Tools and Revlon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  If they could make just one change, increase the wattage to 800 or 1000, I would probably be happy enough with this product to stop looking.  Adding &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; would be nice, too.</li>
    <li> Used it daily, but not over use and It broke within 45 days.  Now its too late to return it.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely air brush.  It is lightweight and easy to use.  Holds well in my hand and gives my hair the volume I like.  Don&#x27;t use it on soaking wet hair.  Completly sponge out your wet hair with an absorbant towel and comb it out.  Let it dry a bit before using the brush.  Doesn&#x27;t take long to do your hair.  Especially if you have shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described.  It is lighter than i had imagined, and very easy to manipulate.  The metal does not overheat and the brushes do not generate too much static.  The density of the brushes are just right - can grab the hair well without causing knots.</li>
    <li> the brush is very soft so I found it not to grip hair and as a result it was a waste this product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have long curly hair and this definitely dries my hair fast with added volume and makes straightning my hait nice and easy!</li>
    <li> This worked really well with my 4b hair.  It practically straightened it which is what I was going for even though it didn&#x27;t seem to get very hot.  I am very satisfied and will be using this hair dryer from now on.</li>
    <li> Great brush -worked well. My hair looked awesome.... but after a week of use it overheated then stopped working. I was using an international adapter to convert from US to OZ plug but obviously.not effective. i now just use it as a blow dry brush with my old drier. Such a pity as I bought a second one as a present for my daughter 2 days before mine died1</li>
    <li> Makes blow drying so much easier!</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use and leaves your hair shiny and silkie with body. The only downside is that your hand rests on the temp control and it&#x27;s easy to slip into cold without noticing. Just a matter of training yourself to hold the brush a bit lower. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Easy to use and get a nice blow dried look with minimal to no frizz. No need to use a blow drier and separate brush which is better for us less coordinated.  No burned fingers, no tangled cord, hair does not get tangled in brush.  Got the larger size and my hair is full without being too &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I never could get the hang of holding a hairbrush in one hand to style my hair while holding the hair dryer in the other had to dry it.  This does both in one step.  The bristles are very soft, so it is easy to spin the brush or move it around.  I love it!  Of course, I read a lot of reviews before choosing this one, so I felt really educated.</li>
    <li> I bought this hot air brush after blowing my hair with a round brush and getting no results.  I have thin, fine hair and as I get older it looks thinner, I tried this as soon as I got it and what a difference!  I have small hands and got the 1.5 inch brush and I had no problem maneuvering around my hair.  The next morning in Church everybody came up to me and asked me if I had my hair cut and it looked so nice, and all I did was trim my bangs.  I have recommended this to my sister who has the same hair type as me, after looking at various models of hot air brushes and looking at demos on youtube, I am glad I chose this one,  after so many positive reviews, I don&#x27;t understand the negative ones, although my hair is still fine, it looks a lot better, and now when I have a special function to go to, I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair drooping at the beginning, my hair is shoulder length, I use it with the John Frieda volume shampoo and conditioner, a little mousse and 20 minutes later my hair is done, although you have to dry your hair first, my hair dries in a few minutes anyway.  Great hot air brush!</li>
    <li> It states that if you have long or thick hair, you may need to dry or air dry your hair, before using this styling brush. They mean it. I, surprisingly, really like that about the product because I can manipulate the brush, without burning myself. It allows me to easily style my hair with much more ease than previous products that I&#x27;ve tried; that have been too hot. The brush size would be too large for hair that is very short, however. My hair is approximately one inch below my jaw line.</li>
    <li> Almost hate to give a good review in case this product sells out. Definitely going to order a spare. Best hair tool ever for my particular hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair and am trying to get it to grow out.  This really does seem to help out with the waves and the frizzy ends.  I think it gives me a smoother result than just my regular blow drying and separate brush.  It does take a bit of time and I definitely agree with their suggestion to get the hair around 80% dry before using the Air Brush.  Better to use it as a finishing tool.</li>
    <li> I have thin, frizzy, extremely curly hair..I am loving this product&lt;br /&gt;Its tangle free brush, very easy to use, works as expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for after u blow dry then use it for curing in hair. Not good for creating spiral since the brush length is too short. I use to have the revlon hot air brush kit and I love it. It dry my hair and style at same time. Length was long so easy to create spiral in my long hair. Only problem is my hair keep getting caught between the gap where the brush attach to the unit. Was hoping this brush would do the same as my old revlon without catching onto my hair. This doesn&#x27;t yank my hair, but takes longer to style and can&#x27;t create nice spiral. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I wanted my hair to look as shiny as it does when I come from the salon. I did a lot of research and found this product. It delivered exactly what was promised, smooth, shiny hair. Easy to use and can style my hair in under 5 minutes and I look like I came out of the salon. I&#x27;ve already bought a second one. I highly recommend if you want that salon look.</li>
    <li> I love this air brush! I have a lot of hair but it is fine, and it is sometimes difficult to style it in a way that pleases me. Often my hair comes out looking too flat. It is shoulder length and one length all around. With this brush I can turn it slightly under at the ends and have a smooth look that is still full and stays that way all day.</li>
    <li> Great for a quick dry and style. I still go over the roots with a flat iron, but at least the rest of my hair has a bouncy curl to it thanks to this.</li>
    <li> This is my third...bought two more...best product for drying my frizzy curly hair! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love how soft, and bouncy my hair feels after using this air brush. It is fairly simple to use, and my medium below-the-shoulder length hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled in the bristles. It gives it volume, and doesn&#x27;t look dried out, or frizzy like regular hair dryers do. I have a little natural wave in my hair, but not really naturally curly. The only con, which I took away a star for, is the time it takes to dry. If you have patience, and a good 15-20 minutes to devote to your hair style, then you will like this brush. I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but when I want to look extra nice, with some loose curls, and extra body, I use it.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for a quick trip and a quick after wash hair drying.  Will not make hair frizzy nor static &amp;#34;rise or clinging&amp;#34; action.</li>
    <li> I retuned this product. It wasn&#x27;t powerful and the bristles were too soft. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it was operational however It will take you forever to dry your hair and I do not have thick hair.</li>
    <li> Prefect way to manage that salon look.</li>
    <li> Somewhat large for short hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this one because at the time my hair was longer and I wanted to be able to curl it and dry at the same time.  I onely used it once and when I did it was easy to use and worked good.</li>
    <li> So I use this when I straighten my hair, I do have to blow dry my hair first and I&#x27;ll get it about 85% dry the old fashioned way, then I use this to focus on the roots, especially in the back of my head where it gets wavy no matter how much I try to dry straight traditionally.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use</li>
    <li> As good as mentioned in the product description.</li>
    <li> I love it love it love it ! Awesome tool to use at home and have the same result you get in the hair salon. It&#x27;s quick convenient and easy to use. I strongly suggest this great product !</li>
    <li> Great for styling, curling or straightening.  Easy to use and Amazon&#x27;s price is the lowest I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> if you wanted to untangle your hair and feel that using a hairbrush hurts your scalp, then use this. It&#x27;s very comfortable. For styling purposes, I can&#x27;t really rely on this b/c it takes forever for my hair to dry and to get styled. Still uses my hair blower and iron to style my hair.</li>
    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything! Didn&#x27;t work at all on my hair. Then tried it on my daughter&#x27;s hair which is much softer and finer than mine and it still didn&#x27;t do anything for Her either. This was a total waste of my money. It&#x27;s already gone to the goodwill.</li>
    <li> Does what I wanted and what is says. Like the large handle.</li>
    <li> I have medium length thin hair. I bought this for less than $30 and it was the best money I have ever spent. I use an extra body mousse and/or a root pump. It is very easy and quick to dry and curl. It provides great volume/body. I would reccomend.</li>
    <li> I use this primarily when I want to style my bangs without pulling out the big old dryer. It also works for the kids because it&#x27;s not as loud as a full size dryer. I don&#x27;t know if it does anything for frizz, but I do like that it has a cool setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it gets the job done and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. It gets way more use than my flat iron or curling iron.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really big and the air is not very warm. It didn&#x27;t curl my hair as much as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this heated brush. I have long straight hair that doesn&#x27;t need any daily maintenance (i rarely even brush it), but it does feel nice to go to work with nice &amp;#34;blowed-out&amp;#34; looking hair. the product is easy to use and super lightweight to keep in my gym bag. after my lunch time workout I can run this through me hair and VOILA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, the seller is terrible. i purchased this product on May 12th and was told shipping time would be May 16-21st. Well, it never shipped from the seller and as of May 24th I have still not received it. So I went to my local Fred Meyer and bought the same product for the same price. I LOVE Amazon, it is the best thing to happen to shopaholics like me, but if it&#x27;s not &#x27;Prime&#x27;, I have no intention of ever buying it again! Unreliable sellers!</li>
    <li> Best styling tool ever</li>
    <li> Love this little brush....I have somewhat curly hair that goes frizzy easily, and this wonderful little brush gets rid of the frizz and gives my hair great shape and shine....would definitely recommend this hot brush...</li>
    <li> Perfect for looking like you just had a blow out! Really works well because you only need one tool. Makes it practical. The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. I have very thick curly hair so it doesn&#x27;t help either. But I love this dryer and use it every time I want to straighten my hair. Works well for the price. Bought them as a gift also.</li>
    <li> I like this but not quite as much as some reviews would have led me to believe. It does shape and dry a little but I need something else to smooth after I use it and it will not dry your hair from towel dry to finished unless you spend a lot of time. It is more for damp hair that has been towel dried and air dried for a half hour.</li>
    <li> John Frieda Hot Air Brush is easy to use, drys hair quickly, and even allows you to style while drying.  I would buy it again, and highly recommend.  If you are traveling internationally, you might search for a different product though.  It does not have dual voltage.  I am going to find another product that I use strictly for travel.</li>
    <li> if you have thick hair, or anything other than very fine thin hair, this is not for you.. It doesn&#x27;t grab hair the way the old Revo Styler used to, and for me it was useless...</li>
    <li> I have fine hair &amp; this makes it flat to my head.  However, it does stop all the frizzy look.  I mostly use it now to flip the ends of my hair up or under - it does that really well.</li>
    <li> It works nicely on dry or damp hair.  Just wish it got a bit hotter for thicker hair, as the highest setting doesn&#x27;t make it as smooth as expected.  Have to go over it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> As with anything new you have to get used to it.  I was burning my fingers a lot at the top because my old curler had a post I could put my fingers on to help control the wand.  This one just has a flat to slightly curved top. For the most part my hair does not get caught in it.  That being said occasionally it will grab a hair but nothing like all the previous ones I have owned have done.  The brush part could be a little longer but is okay.  I have hair that is some times shoulder length but most times just above.  It does a decent job smoothing my hair and giving it a little flip under.  I would give it 5 stars if it never caught my hair, was a little longer and maybe was a little hotter to really force my stubborn straight hair to curl a bit more.  It is a blower though and not a curling iron. I&#x27;ve owned this almost a year and see no reason to buy another until this one dies or falls apart first.</li>
    <li> Loved this item so much I had to buy one for my sister.  I no longer need four hands to dry and style my hair.  Since I do not like to put much time in the project, I have often left my hair to air dry and do what it will.  With a good cut, I can get away with that.  However, it&#x27;s lovely to be able to show off that cut and not spend more than about five minutes on the project. I can do that with this hot air brush.  I usually air dry or use my regular hair dryer to about 80% dry, then finish off and style with the hot air brush.</li>
    <li> Returned! Sliding control button&#x27;s profile is too low making it impossible to manipulate during styling. Also, heat is inadequate. Revlon&#x27;s similar product&#x27;s brissels are not as nice and its heat settings are not in useful order but overall it is a better styling product.</li>
    <li> I was expecting so much more with this... I have had a similar from Conair</li>
    <li> Have used for a couple of weeks and so far I love it! I&#x27;ve never mastered the whole hair blower and brush using 2 hands - so this is perfect. I use it on air dried hair! Would buy again and recommend to all. My hair is chin length and I got the larger one. Will be perfect to take on vacation too!</li>
    <li> This brush is great for dehumidifying my hair. We have very humid days and this help control the frizz. Easy to use, and works better than the larger type of hot brush that I have. The other rotates by itself, but it&#x27;s really too large.</li>
    <li> Perfect hot air brush!  this is my second one, which I ordered  for back-up.  I&#x27;ve used hot air brushes for years and this is the best!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as the only way to dry my hair. It isn&#x27;t powerful enough. I use it to smooth and finish.</li>
    <li> Just received today. Was so excited and couldn&#x27;t wait to use despite having already washed and dried my hair. My hair is halfway between curly and straight, a.k.a. frizzy! Not such a good combination with living in the PNW. I&#x27;ve been keeping my hair short for about a year in attempts to manage the mess! Well, I&#x27;ve been missing my long hair, so I&#x27;ve been brainstorming. I came upon this brush dryer, saw the amazing reviews and the video another user posted, and thought I may as well try it out. The price is so great, less than one of the haircuts I have to get super regularly to keep up with the shortness. I am beyond amazed how well this smoothed my hair, yet gave it tons of volume... and this is without one drop of product! I&#x27;m IN LOVE! Tomorrow I will try again with wet hair and a dab of product. I&#x27;ve never had such amazing results with my normal routine of blow drying with a round brush, smoothing out frizzies with a flat iron, and then adding some bounce with a curling iron. It will make my soon-to-be long hair so much easier to style and way more beautiful than ever!! And will help get through the in between stages fun!! :) YAY YAY YAY!!!</li>
    <li> Love this item. I had another that fell apart but this one is very stable and sturdy. I use straightening cream and my hair stays smooth and straight for days.</li>
    <li> So easy to use.  I have wavy hair, but I use this to smooth my hair.  Much easier and better on my hair than using a flat iron.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Due to so many great reviews, I gave this a shot.  Definitely lived up to all the reviews!  The hot air brush is my go to styling tool, I don&#x27;t know how I ever did without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  For years I&#x27;ve used the Revlon curling brush dryers that have 2 different interchangable size heads.  Well I never use the smaller one and they always end up breaking so that the brush head won&#x27;t stay on.  This one is one piece and will not have that problem.  Also with the Revlon product my hair often would get caught in the &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; where the head attached to the base, this product does not have that problem either.  It blow wells and dries/curls my hair nicely.  I do partially dry my hair with a regular blow dryer first as I have always done.</li>
    <li> Like many reviewers, at age 66 I&#x27;ve used every tool invented for drying, curling, smoothing hair. This Hot Air Brush is the best yet. I was using an older technology hot air brush that got too hot. There was a lower setting on my previous brush but it only cut back on the blowing - not the heat of the surface. I felt (and it looked) like my hair was getting burned. This tool is not too hot even on the high setting and allows me to quickly turn under my very thick, straight, color-treated hair. I blow dry until it is just damp then it only takes a few minutes using this brush to get my shoulder-length hair into a perfect style - not too fussy/fixed - but just smoothly turned under and still swingy. I highly recommend this tool.</li>
    <li> If I could I would give this 10 stars.  I&#x27;ve had several hot air brushes.  I have a tough time holding a clumsy hair dryer and a brush at the same time.  This brush has 3 levels.  My hair does not get tangled in the brush.  The bristles are soft not hard plastic like other hot air brushes.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  I bought this because of the name.  It didn&#x27;t curl my hair well at all.  I then bought Revelon&#x27;s version - cheaper and works MUCH better.</li>
    <li> Only works intermittently, tried to return but too late.not a long enough time to be able to return a non working item.&lt;br /&gt;Should have spent a bit more for better quality item.</li>
    <li> Because of arthritis I have trouble managing both a brush and a blow dryer.  This product solves the  problem .  The  brush is large enough to give lift to my hairstyle.  This is my second order for this Hot Air Brush....I now have a spare in case my daughter &amp;#34;borrows&amp;#34; it!</li>
    <li> this hot air brush is greatest brush I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair.It doesn&#x27;t dehydrate my hair or break my hair and it doesn&#x27;t overheat so my hair doesn&#x27;t smell burnt</li>
    <li> This bigger one was too big to give my limp thin hair much of a curl...it did smoth it out though and is SO much easier than having to use 2 hands, one to hold the brush and then the hair dryer to curl it. This one take just one hand only and; I look forward to seeing what the one inch does for my hair! It&#x27;s here already but haven&#x27;t used it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10/14 UPDATED REVIEW:  I LOVE IT. THE ONE INCH BARREL DID A MUCH BETTER JOB OF CURLING MY FINE THIN HAIR; THE 1.5 WAS TOO BIG FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I noticed was that the smaller one was not as easy to touch the bristles and not get burned. I guess because they are shorter and the heat is really really HOT. I think you could burn your hair right off if you were not careful @500 watts. I used a spray for protecting hair from heat, then on the same line, a spray that was to help add curl, and finally I had to top it off with a really thickening mouse. I blowed my hair until it was damp. Then I started using this curler. I was able to section my hair into 1 for top, 2 for crow, and 3 for bottom. Then did 2 times each on the hair behind my ear. Then twice on the sides to uplift the roots and curl the ends. For the last 10 years I&#x27;ve just shampooed and blowed dried and slept on it...and it was fine. Now I&#x27;ve lost so much hair I HAD to do something. My hair dresser said \\&quot;IT IS TIME TO USE A PRODUCT NOW EACH TIME!\\&quot; Or else I am just going to have flat hair. ugh. I am 67 but just as vain as ever :&gt;). So this is reminiscent of days gone by when I had an outside job and spent tons of time on my hair. Today my hair looks great...but living in Hawaii it picks up the moisture . The ions REALLY make your hair SHINE. But just remember you NEED to use some kind of heat protector or else you&#x27;re going to fry your hair. I wish the little slide to change heat from low to high was easier to use when using the thing. Other than that I do really love it and my hair looks a LOT fuller. It takes both; product &amp; curls to acheive this look.</li>
    <li> The barrel does not come off which has its pros and cons.  The removable ones I tend to break anyway, but I like being able to use it to dry my hair, then snap the barrel on and curl it.  Can&#x27;t do that with this one.  The barrel seems unusually large for 1.5 inches.  Better for longer hair.  Good heat, good airflow.</li>
    <li> I have very fine short hair.  This works great for me because it&#x27;s all I need to dry my hair and style.  Easier to use than a blow dryer and brush.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Did not work well with fine straight hair that has a lot of slip. I was optimistic about this product giving me body in my hair as it&#x27;s completely flat on my head. It did not suit this purpose for me anymore than blow drying my hair upside down. It did not make my hair look any worse though, and did make an area around my face that looks a little damaged blend in more with the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also hoping beyond hope that this would help my bangs stay together and not split as I am trying to grow them out and they have been driving me nuts. This actually was much worse at that than a fine toothed comb and a regular blow dryer and they split once I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have faith in this product from the reviews for girls with a different hair type and needs than my own so am going to let my friend with thick curly hair try it and hope it works miracles for her before I send it back.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and very easy to use. My hair looks and feels like I just had it blown out at the salon.  I never write reviews, but had to with this one.  I&#x27;ve owned others like this, but they usually rip my hair out or it gets snagged.  I am thrilled with this item!!</li>
    <li> I like the hot air brush a lot but wish the barrel was a little smaller. My hair is just below my ears but really straight. So a smaller barrel would be better in my situation. I bought because it is much gentler on my hair, no more little burns on my neck from a hot metal barrel.&lt;br /&gt;When my hair gets longer I am sure I will love it.</li>
    <li> I got this product expecting great results.  I had some trouble getting the brushes to grab the crown of my hair &amp; then was disappointed by the drying mechanism; it didn&#x27;t do a great job of drying that section of the hair.  The end result was that I could not style my hair right.  I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the conair hot brush I had for years. It&#x27;s not the same quality my conair had, but it works. The conair was loud, but it blew a ton of air and was really hot. It got my long hair done in 10-15 mins from wet to dry. This thing is a little more quiet, but does not blow a lot of air and is not nearly as hot. It took me 25 mins to get it done this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the deep, long bristles. They grab my hair very well and hold on to it. My old conair was still going strong, but the brush part was removable to switch to different sizes, and the connectors cracked. The brush no longer stays attached, so its useless. This one does not have a removable brush, so I see no reason for that to happen here. Overall, it seems more cheaply made than my conair. I hope it holds out in the long run.</li>
    <li> I just love this dryer! It is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair ( as a similar product did). And, it leaves my wavy hair sleek and smooth.</li>
    <li> These are a Christmas gifts for my daughter &amp; daughter in law . Both have very long hair and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll get great use if these tools . Especially with their hectic schedules. They were delivered on time as expected.</li>
    <li> Loved the one that I got for myself,so ordered this for a birthday gift, works awsome on my thick long hair</li>
    <li> I really researched before choosing a hot air brush. This does do what is advertised. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because your hair really does have to be 80% dry before you can use the hot air brush. So depending on how much time you have you need to pull out the blow dryer too. I paired this with a john Frieda volumizing moouse.  There are lots of helpful videos on YouTube as well.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, even when you are not very skilled with hair styling.  I have fine, straight hair, and this really helps with styling a natural looking Bob.</li>
    <li> Growing up in Japan, I&#x27;ve used many of these types of hot air brushes before. This is the first non-Japanese hot air brush I really like! The quality of the brush itself is really good. When I style my hair with this thing, my hair looks shinier than when I dry only with normal hair dryer and brush. By the way, the brush part doesn&#x27;t rotate with this one. I also have one of those with a rotating brush, and while they may add even more shine, I like this one better because I think the rotating ones are more harsh on your hair, takes longer to style and harder to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s very easy to control. I&#x27;m not very good at styling my hair especially in the back, but with this one my hair will have more \\&quot;styled\\&quot; look when I&#x27;m done. And it takes less time for me than a normal hair dryer w/ brush or a dryer w/ rotating brush.&lt;br /&gt;2. The quality of the brush is really good. Not too hard &amp; not too soft. Adds shine to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s incredibly light.&lt;br /&gt;4. The price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are a few negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t have a built-in transformer. This is the biggest negative for me, as I often travel to Japan (100v) and Italy (220v). I think any personal appliances you&#x27;d travel with such as compact hair dryer, chargers of laptop computers, tablet, cell phones, shavers, cameras, camcorders and so on, should have built-in transformers. I would&#x27;ve loved to take it with me to my next Italy trip only if it worked there. If you rarely travel to other countries this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;2. The handle is big and it&#x27;s kind of hard to have a good grip. Because you use it like a brush, I&#x27;d like a skinnier handle to have a better control. I have larger hands and it&#x27;s not a big deal for me but if your hands are smaller you may have a hard time.&lt;br /&gt;3. You cannot take off the brush part. If you could take it off, you could&#x27;ve used it as a regular dryer, which makes it convenient especially for travel. It would alsomade it easier to clean the brush part. Not a deal breaker though,&lt;br /&gt;4. There is only one switch to control the air and the temperatures. Off - low - high - cool. I prefer to have two switches for air and temperatures so that I can go back &amp; force from hot &amp; cool no matter what air setting I have. No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, except the no transformer issue, for me, these negatives are all small issues. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love it! Hair gets smooth, the heat is ok and it is not noisy at all.</li>
    <li> When i saw this I HAD to try it! I always struggled with the whole hair dryer in one hand and brush in the other hand thing to dry my hair. This makes straightening my hair much easier, especially the back. The only thing is that for best results you need to either towel dry really well or blow dry all over for a few minutes otherwise it will take forever to dry using this alone. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Beyond expectations I love this product. The mousse is very good also.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy these products.&lt;br /&gt;Yoli Juan</li>
    <li> Works really well for my fine hair. Makes it shiny and bouncy. Highly recommend. I partially dry my hair with a blow dryer and finish with this.</li>
    <li> I find this item to be totally useless. The bristles are far too soft to grasp the hair. I had thrown out the packaging or I would have returned it. Offered it to my daughter and she didn&#x27;t want it either. If you feel the need to buy it then hold on to the packaging until you have tried it. A stiff round brush and your hair dryer will work way better than this piece of junk. This is the only thing that I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon that I have hated and I have been with them almost from the beginning.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer was ok in the sense that the heat was hot. The 3 problems I encountered with it was that the handle is too thick&lt;br /&gt;and uncomfortable to hold and rotate. And the other problem was the switch because of the sliding selector button its hard to stop it from the angle that you are pushing it up and down. Also, you can&#x27;t use it on wet hair. Your hair can only be slightly damp.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to return it and missed the date by one day.</li>
    <li> It was not hot enough to style my hair. I wasted my money.  It did blow enough air either, very weak!</li>
    <li> I look like I just left the salon after using this instrument.  My hair is sleek and soft and full of body.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have some shoulder problems, and it is hard for me to hold a brush and blow dry my hair.  This brush takes care of that for me!  I can simply roll the hair onto the brush and the hot air dries it into a nice full style.  It doesn&#x27;t curl the hair, but it makes it full and soft with lots of volume.  It was just what I needed to fix my short hair.  It blows lots of nice hot air, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried John Frieda products before and decided to give the air brush a try. I really like the big handle. The brush itself if very sturdy so it keeps my hair taut while I am styling it. Does not take long at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> So easy to use, left my hair shiny and bouncy and straight with zero frizz. Not as much control as, say, a flat iron... but they&#x27;re different tools. Was much easier to use than a hairdryer and round brush.</li>
    <li> My heading says it all. I am  well on my way to being a very mature adult (this means old) and have used hot air brushes for many, many years. This one needed to be in my life long, long ago. What is most impressive is lack of &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34;. Every other hot air brush I have owned over the years, including the one prior to this one, had extremely hot air at base of brush. Care has to be taken to avoid damaging hair. The other nice feature is the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting and it does lock in the curl. The only small, small issue I had when trying it out for the first time was the difficulty in turning it on and moving the control from one setting to another. The control is tight and doesn&#x27;t slide easily. Other reviewers have expressed this as well.  I have had this same problem with other hot air brushes and years ago found a solution. All it takes is a small piece of self stick Velcro attached to the control and you have all the stability and grip you needs. This little fix takes about one second to complete and doesn&#x27;t affect handing. It didn&#x27;t deter me from giving this little gem 5 stars because all of the other attributes out weigh this minor issue. Would love to have John Frieda manufacture hot air brush with smaller roller for shorter hair. How perfect would that be!</li>
    <li> I use this as a styler.  I have never tried to dry my hair with it, so I can&#x27;t review that aspect.  This is - by far - my favorite hot air brush, and I&#x27;ve been using hot air brushes to style my hair for over 20 years!  500 watts is the perfect strength.  I have one that&#x27;s 250 watts, and it works well, but it it takes much longer.  I have one that&#x27;s 1250 watts, and it&#x27;s way too strong... any styling is ruined because it gets blown the opposite way.  I think a 750 watt hot air brush would be too high also because this one really is perfect!</li>
    <li> I use this when I travel as it saves room from having to pack round brushes and a hair dryer.  Also was good to have when I had my arm in a sling.  Easier to use with one arm than brush and hair dryer!</li>
    <li> As soon as  we unpacked it,I tried it out on my son .We had given him an undercut hair style the other day. As he has natural wavy hair the top was wavy. After using the air brush his hair on top is completely straight. I switched back and forth from cool to heat and he never complained ;which is a first, hair dryers are sometimes to hot for adults as well.  This really works well,unless your a hairstylist and are great with a brush and blow dryer this is the better way to go, for the to do hair styles.  Towel dry your hair  really well. Put some product in if you want and style. It&#x27;s easy  bristlesare nice too not to rough no scratching your scalp. Get this  you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I guess this hot air brush will work if you have long hair, but not for short.  The  brush is too large.  I could not wrap my hair around it to dry it properly.</li>
    <li> No need for a flat iron anymore</li>
    <li> I used this product 3 times since I got it and every time, my hair comes out silky straight.  I have very curly thin hair that does nothing but frizz. Drying my hair with the blow dryer and the brush was a ton of work so I would end up in a pony tail.  I section my hair in 4 parts, add my loreal products and blow it out. Even my roots are straight and I finish it off by using styling cream. I love this product and would never go back to my old method.</li>
    <li> Not enough power for my long thick hair but sure it would work very well on shorter hair.</li>
    <li> You really do have to blow dry your hair first until it is just damp. It is time consuming and tends to make my hair a little frizzy, I have very straight hair so frizz is not a common problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I purchased the Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush. It is heavy and does not grab the hair as well as the Helen of Troy Brush. I kept it and will use it as a back up if the Helen of Troy Brush ever fails.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I have arthritis in my hands and styling hair is always painful for me.  This is so easy and eliminates all other tools for styling hair.  Everything I need in one product. No frizz~just shiny soft hair.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna E.</li>
    <li> Bristles too soft to be of use in holding, brushing or styling hair. I do not recommend this product for purchase.</li>
    <li> Straight fine hair bobbed blonde hair--this is just OK.  I had a heavy, loud, hot pink, Revlon hot brush.  The Revlon brush has shorter bristles and smaller barrel and terrible reviews on Amazon.  It was so heavy and noisy that I couldn&#x27;t hold it above my head for long.  I thought this brush looked great and violated my usual policy of not buying another of the same thing while the old one still works.  This Frieda brush works fine, is light, and much quieter.  However, it seems to fill my hair with static.  I don&#x27;t get the same level of curl or control I got with the smaller barrel.  In hindsight, the one inch barrel size would have been better.  So, have gone back to the Revlon brush.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have extremely thick hair that goes to the middle of my back. It takes me about 30-45 minutes to dry my hair with this tool, but it looks sleek, shiny and amazing when it&#x27;s done. I don&#x27;t have any problems with it tangling in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my 5 year old daughter who has thin hair that&#x27;s prone to tangling. It takes about 10 brushes per section of hair to get it dry. She loves having it done at it never gets too hot or tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone. It makes blow drying your hair sleek and straight easy.</li>
    <li> The power is somewhat limited and you have to have patience to dry your hair in smaller sections. Otherwise, I do like it.</li>
    <li> I, for the life of my, cannot use a round brush and blow dryer. My hair ends up a big tangled mess. I bought this brush as a solution. It works great - no tangles and easy to shape my hair. I just wish the dryer blew with a little more power - it doesn&#x27;t have as much as a standard blow dryer, so your hair will take longer to dry. Consider air drying for a bit first?</li>
    <li> I actually really like this product. My hair is thin, and it doesnt make a huge difference, but I feel more put together after I use it. Used quite a bit. I imagine it would take a while if my hair were thick.....</li>
    <li> Overall this product is good for its price. Love that it&#x27;s got a cool air option and the cord swivels well so I&#x27;m not tangled up after trying to do my hair. The brush portion is also nice and it smooths out my hair a lot when I use it. I don&#x27;t like that the the drying capabilities on this air brush are so weak - it takes me 20 minutes longer to use this in my damp hair than any other hot air brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past. Also, the tip is small (like it&#x27;s just a flat piece of plastic) so there&#x27;s nothing to hold onto. I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve burnt my fingertips on the brush. But if I don&#x27;t hold the other end as I&#x27;m using the brush I don&#x27;t get as good of results as if I held it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very talented when it comes to blow drying my hair, but you&#x27;d never know it when I use this hot air brush. I&#x27;ve used similar models that had rotating heads (Infiniti Pro by conair), and was initially disappointed that this one required a little more elbow grease on my part, but the trade off is worth it. Before I&#x27;d have to worry about my hair getting caught in moving parts, but with this brush, I&#x27;m way more in control. My only complaint is that it does take a while to fully dry my hair.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted to help get the humidity frizz out of my hair.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have the option of changing to a smaller brush if desired.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush! I have very thick, coarse hair that frizzes without a flat iron. However, I have been able to eliminate the hot iron entirely using this brush. It&#x27;s power and heat are exceptional and the ease of use has impressed me as I have tried a number of other products which did not work nearly as well. I was so impressed, I bought a second to have on hand in the event that something happens to my original hot air brush. So far, the first one is still working great. I recommended to a family member, who also bought one and loves it.</li>
    <li> Used it 5 times and bristles lost their shape and doesn&#x27;t grab the hair  not enough wattage for a blowbrush</li>
    <li> I have one of these myself and had my granddaughter try mine.  She loved it so I got her one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I have hair mostly one length about an inch below my ears. This hot air brush does a great job styling my hair. I have fairly thick hair so I dry it till its damp with my blow dryer. Then I switch to this to style it. My hair never gets tangled in the bristles. The end gets hot but that&#x27;s no big deal, just don&#x27;t hold it there! I like this very much and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Takes longer than using separate blower and brush. Easy to use for styling. Hair seems to be softer and less dry looking.</li>
    <li> As far as I know, my wife is satisfied with this product.  In any event, she has not said anything to me one way or the other, so I assume it meets expectations.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product that works as promised, had no issues with it. There are three heat levels and they are very good.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product and recommended it to friends. It is very easy to use and saved me $35 a week that I was spending on blow drys.  But, one day I was using it and heard some rattling and smelled something awful and it had died. I ordered another one and will try to get a refund or credit for the first one. But this is the perfect product for me when it was alive.</li>
    <li> Tried this on a friends recommendation, did not like it as it took too long on my thick hair.  My friend has thin hair and it works great for her.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I loved the concept of this dryer because I find it difficult to use both a blow dryer in one hand &amp; a round brush in the other to dry &amp; style my hair. I thought this would solve the problem with single handed styling, however, this did not work well for me. I have very fine hair, but it is frizzy. You can not use this dryer on wet or even damp hair, it is just not powerful enough to get the job done. I would use my regular blow dryer to semi-dry my hair &amp; then use the John Freida Hot Air brush to finish the job-blow drying section by section to get some lift &amp; smoothness. This dryer just did not work for me at all. It did not make my hair smooth &amp; left it puffy &amp; frizzy. Thinking of returning it. The only thing I can see it useful for is perhaps blow drying bangs or a side sweep. I gave it 2 stars because it is a great concept, but definitely needs to be made more powerful with perhaps a higher heat setting.</li>
    <li> This thing is great! I have a short Bob and this dryer brush is perfect! I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> This is better than using a blow dryer and brush.  It is very light, so your arm doesn&#x27;t get tired and I like that it has a medium and cool setting too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence with this dryer. It&#x27;s easy to use and light but it just takes so long to dry your hair. Maybe it needs more power.  When I need to fully and quickly dry my hair I pass it over for my regular dryer</li>
    <li> Who needs the high priced one. THis is a great product and I wish they had had it years ago. I bought the Instyler and it would tangle your hair...this is a great product</li>
    <li> By far this is the best hair dryer I have owned. I had read the reviews before purchasing and followed the respondents advice. Thanks so much for the advice. I also have fine shoulder length hair and was concerned about the hair getting tangled on the brush. Regardless of the speed and where I place the brush on the hair, either at the root, middle or ends there are no tangles. I use another hair dryer to start the process (it speeds the drying time) and finish with the John Frieda dryer. Previously I dryed my hair about 90% and then used large rollers for the last 10% of the drying process to get the volumn. Lastly, I used the hair iron on the ends. I skip the roller step now and don&#x27;t miss it a bit. I get all the volumn I want from the John Frieda hair dryer and finish with the iron if that&#x27;s the look and style I want for the day. The dryer is light in weight, very easy to use and requires no learning curve. I got the style I was looking for the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> poorly made  -  does  not get hot enough to dry your  hair</li>
    <li> Awesome concept, but with use, burn out after 5-6 uses.  Maybe my hair is too long, or too thick, but it is amazing, if it didnt burn out.</li>
    <li> AWESOME! I LOVE THIS ITEM,EASY AND LIGHT. LOOK LIKE I WENT TO THE SALOON TO DO MY HAIR.  SINCE I STARTED USING THIS HOT AIRBRUSH, I BEEN GETTING COMPLIMENTS. I BEEN HAVING SAME HAIR STYLE BUT JUST WITH A CHANGE FROM HAIR DRYER + BRUSH TO JOHN FREIDA HOT AIR BRUSH, I GET TOTALLY DIFFERENT LOOK. HAIR TEXTURE IS SOFTER, MORE TIDY &amp; SHINNING AND LOOK PROFESSIONALLY DONE.  IT IS SO MUCH LIGHTER COMPARED TO USE A NORMAL HAIR DRYER AND COMB. I WISH I HAVE BOUGHT THIS EARLIER BUT THE TIMING IS PERFECT AS I GET A REDUCED PRICE.  THANKS TO THOSE  REVIEW WITH VIDEO POSTED WHICH ALLOW ME TO  HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND BE PREPARED ON HOW TO USE THIS ITEM.  VERY HAPPY WITH THIS.</li>
    <li> Love the concept. But hardly any power on it. It is definitely not a hair dryer replacement. I mostly just use it for my little girl now and if I am in a hurry, I just skip it. A little dissappointed.</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair it is pretty wavy. I was so impressed how I was able to partly dry my hair then use the John Freida hot air brush. It smooths, shines, curls all in one. I love it, the only reason for 4 stars is the power switch it could be easier. People actually asked me if I was doing something different to my hair because it looked fuller.  I was never able to get my hair this smooth with a round brush and blow dryer. Wow wow....</li>
    <li> Huge iron. The diameter of the handle is huge. But curls well I hope. Am writing this on delivery which was in time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect to much. Actually, I was searching for a rotating brush on Amazon and this came up as one of the first search results, so I bought it. Turns out it&#x27;s not a rotating brush. Thank you amazon, NOT.</li>
    <li> This is my third brush, since I buy this product and keep it in every house I stay at. Simplifies life.</li>
    <li> I have kinda curly/straight hair and this hot air brush is just perfect for me, easy to use, gently with the hair and heats quickly. Also the product looks so elegant.</li>
    <li> Only thing I would change is the control.  Too hard to push back and forth because it&#x27;s too flat to the surface of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a good brush for very little money.</li>
    <li> Works fine. I really dislike the power switch. It&#x27;s difficult to get to high heat without going to the cool air. The power switch seriously sucks</li>
    <li> Left hair soft and straight with lots of volume. Way easier than holding a hair dryer and brush. Hair looked great.</li>
    <li> I like the product very much.  It&#x27;s nice not having to use both a dryer and a brush at the same time and my medium length, fine, relatively straight hair dries smooth with a soft wave to it.  I haven&#x27;t totally gotten the hang of it on both sides but I find that it&#x27;s a great tool to have on hand.  The best part is that my hair does not get tangled around the brush at all and comes out easily.  The brush does not move as in some other products, you have to do it yourself, but I think that&#x27;s way it doesn&#x27;t tangle at all.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This item is easy to use and it straightens my hair quickly. Like most moms, I have limited time in the morning. This brush gets the job done on the days I want to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I have never been one to use a hair dryer since I never have the time, skill, or patience.  This I can use while sitting on the couch without even looking in a mirror.  It dries quickly and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. It gets plenty hot enough to do the job and much easier than a dryer and brush. Make sure hair is somewhat dry  I blow dry a little before I use this brush.</li>
    <li> This product probably works better on thinner, shorter hair. My bob of medium length needs to be manually dried quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair which didn&#x27;t curl as well as I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is better than using a regular roll brush and hairdryer but didn&#x27;t save me that much time.</li>
    <li> Finally, I love my hair again! I have a great cut (layers just past shoulder length) and color (medium auburn), and when I leave the salon, I feel like a million bucks. Once home, however, I look like I&#x27;ve stuck my finger in a socket. Unless I spend the time to first blow dry, then straighten with a flattening iron and then curl with a curling iron, I look like I just rolled out of bed. And even with all that work, it lacks body and shine. NOT ANYMORE!!! I do still use my blow dryer to get the wet out, but then this Hot Air Brush is magic on my locks!! I have received so many compliments and questions about what new stylist I&#x27;m using. It&#x27;s truly amazing. Highly, highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This is better than sliced bread!  I love this, it is easy to use and wish I purchased it ten years ago.  The price is great.</li>
    <li> I learned about this product from my daughter-in-law when I borrowed hers recently.  It saves me time drying my shoulder length hair which I put in a pony tail.  With a little more time, it would dry my hair to a &amp;#34;Page Boy&amp;#34; if that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This hot air brush exceeded my expectations. It smooths the frizz out of my thick, coarse hair and makes it look shiny and gives it volume.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once since purchase last week.  But very happy with the results.  Good quality brush and the heat is appropriate.</li>
    <li> This product is very time consuming. It took me almost 50 minutes to curl my hair. I want a faster one so I returned it an purchased a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is terrific.  I&#x27;m not one to fuss with hair.  I get great results quickly.  It is much gentler to my hair than a flat iron.  I get compliments after using it.  Gives a nice smooth look.</li>
    <li> i was excited for this product originally. i read a few positive reviews and it looked like a good product, but after receiving in the mail and giving it a try, it did basically nothing to my wet hair even if i held in the same spot for a longer time. i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because i have thicker hair or what, but it was not getting the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they need to up the wattage and power for this dryer for it to start even being remotely productive. suggestion? look for another one. i will be returning this and looking for a different hair dryer/brush.</li>
    <li> I got this brush about 2 months ago and so far I like it. I wish it would get a little hotter but maybe that would be dangerous (?) I have a chin length bobbed style haircut and it is good for smoothing out frizz and slightly curling under my chin. Not terribly noisy, I don&#x27;t wake up the whole house in the mornings when I use it.</li>
    <li> This seemed like a great product and was excited to try something to provide easy styling on the days I don&#x27;t curl my long hair. However, like the other reviews mentioned, this works better for short hair. Though it did provide my hair with a little flip at the end it wasn&#x27;t enough to give it enough style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my mom who has short hair and it seems to work for her.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine, almost-shoulder-length, naturally curly hair.  The John Frieda takes three to four times as long to blow out my hair compared to the Revlon Ionic. And if I start with damp hair, it&#x27;s no good, because the John Frieda isn&#x27;t hot enough to smooth out the kinks from my hair starting to dry curly. (Update: I went back to using Moroccan Oil versus another brand, and the curls/kinks smooth better when partially dry.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could combine the John Frieda brush head (wide, holds the hair remarkably well and results in nice volume around the crown of the head) with the power of my Revlon Ionic. Granted, the Revlon is very loud, but ear plugs take care of the potential for noise-induced hearing loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone from John Frieda is reading this, PLEASE double the power. Make the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting. I also submitted this request to marketing@conair.com</li>
    <li> A very inexpensive, effective styling brush. Use after blow drying your hair about 75%. It gives volume and some nice curl.</li>
    <li> I use this with Sebastian Whipped Creme Light Conditioning style Whip, and obtain soft bouncy curls. I have pin-straight hair that barely holds a wave except when it&#x27;s humid ;-&amp;#62; I find it lightweight to hold and easy to turn a curl (even though I have a repetitive stress injury I get no pain when using this brush). I have no talent for styling my hair and have been amazed at how nicely this brush leaves my hair soft and wavy. I&#x27;m even thinking of buying a backup in case they stop making it, which happens with god many products I like. I&#x27;m not sure how the results would be with a different styling mouse or with thick hair, but this brush has given me a quick and easy way to add some swing to my hair!</li>
    <li> It basically just brushes the top layer of hair; it doesn&#x27;t get all of your hair by any means. Does NOTHING for the rest.  -_-</li>
    <li> Works really really well! I love it. I wash my hair at night and in the morning and completely dry it with this item. It gives me the volume I need.</li>
    <li> First let me note that I have thin, fine hair.  This product does give my hair more body and a little curl.  The only thing I would change about it is that I&#x27;d have the highest heat setting be the farthest up on the slide switch, rather than the cold air one (that I never use) for &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34; the style.  This product is much more substantial than the last hot air brush I had.  I do NOT use it as a hair dryer, though; that would take too long.  When I either air dry my hair partway or use a regular hair dryer first, it works very well.  I would NOT recommend it as your ONLY hair dryer, though.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife.  She says itdoes a great job.  Loves it,  although she wishes the barrel of the brush was slightly thinner. Brush  grabs and holds the hair when drying and is soft enought so that when you go over your ear it doesn&#x27;t hurt or scratch your ear.</li>
    <li> I usually blow dry my hair on the highest setting. This brush on high setting turns my hair too hot within seconds, it hurts to touch it. Also, while it dries the bottom, it doesn&#x27;t dry the top. Anyway, due to it&#x27;s being super hot, I have many split ends and breakage on ends. I&#x27;m going back to a traditional blow dryer; that way I can keep the heat further from my hair so it&#x27;s not as damaging.</li>
    <li> This brush is very easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t get so hot as to burn your hair.  In fact, it leaves your hair silky and shiny, just as if you left the salon!  Just make sure you allow your hair to dry somewhat before using it for best results.  It would be nice to see a smaller barrel for the hair which could be interchangeable, but this size works nicely for medium length hair.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for the barrel was to big.</li>
    <li> This device was not what I thought it would be.  This brush does not rotate.  However, the bristle quality is nice and it does get me a little closer to looking like I had my hairdresser blow my hair straight (NOT as nice as the salon, but closer).  It has made my hair shiny, straight, and frizz free, however it does absolutely zero in terms of adding volume.  I&#x27;m not sure about curls yet--I&#x27;m still getting the hang of this thing.  The air/ heat power is very good, but it does take a little longer than a regular hair dryer to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother to replace a 1970s wonder model that must have been made from early Apollo mission rejects. It finally kicked the bucket and she needed a replacement.  Not made of nearly the same long lasting material as they used to, but works well.  She is happy with it.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as your only drying device because it doesn&#x27;t put out a lot of air.  Works bests if you dry it 75% with a standard dryer, then use this to finish off.  I definitely prefer it over a curling iron or round brush.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, but it just doesn&#x27;t do the job for me. I returned to my flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is one of many hot air brushes I&#x27;ve used over the years.  So far it has outlasted the majority of them and continues to work without issues.  It has enough settings to be versatile and doesn&#x27;t fry the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> This little guy makes blowing out my hair SO EASY. It&#x27;s become a complete essential.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice dryer brush but I wish it rotated while it dried your hair</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time reading reviews on this, and decided it was worth a shot.  The idea is great, but it doesn&#x27;t come thru.  I have thick/course hair and it takes forever to dry and then use a round brush as well to smooth it out and get some body.  I did what the instructions said and dried my hair with a regular dryer at least 85% of the way.  I would then use this at the end and do the &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; of my styling routine.  It seemed to take forever in order for it to work properly and get enough heat to the barrel to get my hair to set.  Perhaps it would work better on hair that was finer, but I would not recommend for anyone who has a lot of hair or hair that is thick.  It takes less time to do it the old way with the dryer and round brush.  I&#x27;m disappointed because I was really hoping this would work better.</li>
    <li> I liked it so much,  I bought one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Missis likes it, lets see how long it lasts ?</li>
    <li> I just cut my hair short and was having a hard time with the curling iron I normally use. This was a great addition to my hair styling collection. It works well on my short hair.</li>
    <li> All around not the styling brush for me.  It is too heavy; the handle is too thick and there is no soft grip to it; and the cord does not rotate.  The Ionic styler is much better.</li>
    <li> A little larger around than I thought. Would have liked it better if it were 1&amp;#34; instead.</li>
    <li> Does John Frieda Hot Air Brush come with 1&amp;#34; (one inch diameter) size ?&lt;br /&gt;this one too big for short hair !!!</li>
    <li> Great styling brush! The result is similar to a salon blowout with just a little more volume (but I&#x27;m practicing different techniques and getting closer). The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the position of the cool button. As another reviewer commented, it&#x27;s easy to accidentally slide from hot to cool without noticing at first. Other than that minor flaw, the brush works well and effectively straightens my shoulder-length hair.  I use with the HSI thermal protector. Very sleek.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair to shoulder length so I don&#x27;t really use this styling tool anymore but when I had longer hair and used it, friends would ask what I had done differently and comment that my hair looked great. I don&#x27;t know why more don&#x27;t use a hot air brush. Works great. I can&#x27;t comment as to whatever this one is better than any others because this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever owned but it works great.</li>
    <li> A no go for me. I have wavy thick hair. This caused SO MUCH frizz. I even tried it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and FRIZZ.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but I love it!!! It makes round brushing your hair so easy! With the dryer and brush I have to constantly set them both down to get a new layer but with one hand free I can just keep going. My hair also doesn&#x27;t get tangled up like it does with a round brush sometimes. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this curling blow dryer but this is the third one I have purchased and they have all died less than a year after I purchased!</li>
    <li> Probable the best little round airbrush I have used. Airspeed/hot air flow is good.other models like conair the air flow is so low it takes longer to dry a damp piece of hair.this one works better. Fits nice in hand .I just like it better.</li>
    <li> My wife was a little hesitant about it at first since it was unlike the one she had before, but she loves it.  Works great and her hair never looked better.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, fine hair. This device has been the best styling tool I have ever used on my hair. It only takes minutes to get a nice smooth style. My hair always looks so perfect now and in about 1/2 the time or less. Since I have fine hair I appreciate the softer bristles, but that might be a problem for courser hair. I&#x27;m purchasing another one for back up. . . just in case they stop producing them. . . can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
    <li> This Frieda Hot Air Brush is wonderful. It&#x27;s very effective in creating smooth curls and volume. The heat level is great, and the brush is easy to use. I can take one section of hair that&#x27;s been blown-dry and make terrific, smooth curls. My only complaint is that the small side panel for options (Hot, Medium, Cool, Off) is extremely awkward to use.  After heating a curl, I have to maneuver the panel around to slide it to Cool. It&#x27;s very user-unfriendly. I would strongly suggest to John Frieda that the next model of this Hot Air Brush include a Cool-Shot BUTTON so that the user doesn&#x27;t have to try to slide the panel options up and down while holding the Brush in difficult position. If it&#x27;s behind your head, you can&#x27;t SEE where the COOL option is, and so you end up sliding the panel up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, John Frieda. Please. Put a Cool-Shot Button on the handle so that it&#x27;s easy to cool down the curls quickly without fumbling and dropping the brush or getting the whole thing tangled in your hair.</li>
    <li> I think I was expecting for this to be the automatic kind, which it isn&#x27;t. I was okay with that when I realized it, but I just haven&#x27;t gotten a lot of use out of this product. It&#x27;s supposed to give you a blowout effect, but the timing is incredibly tricky. You&#x27;re supposed to dry your hair halfway or more with a regular blow dryer and then finish with this, which is a bit labor intensive. Then, by the time I get around half of my head with this, the other half has already air dried. I use it on my bangs, so it isn&#x27;t a total waste, but I wouldn&#x27;t have paid the money if I knew I would only use it for that.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever gotten for my hair. Cannot live without</li>
    <li> I have used another brand of hot air brush, but the motor burned out twice!  (Bought two!)  This John Frieda is fantastic! It has lasted so long, is very reliable and so easy to use. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Love it, except did not realize the brush was a little bit to large for my hair - but it does the job.</li>
    <li> You would have to have longer hair to use this brush. The concept was great, but I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it had I seen the size of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as well as the rotating hot air brush. FYI: I have a shoulder length bob and very fine, straight hair. I&#x27;ve been using a curling iron brush and really wanted something that wasn&#x27;t so damaging. The rotating brush was the biggest disaster and I HATED IT! This, however, is perfect! It gives me ALMOST salon blow out volume! I haven&#x27;t tried it as an actual hair dryer yet, but as a styling tool it is great. The heat is not too hot and it is easy to handle. This size does not give any curl, strictly volume and a nice turn under. If you want any kind of curl, you might want to try the 1&amp;#34;. It also made my hair super shiny. Very Happy!</li>
    <li> I have long-ish, fine limp hair and this product has been great for me! I am a complete idiot when it comes to styling my hair, and before I bought this thing, volume was a word that was just not in my vocabulary. Blowdrying and round-brushing my hair at the same time? Not happening for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got this little appliance, it&#x27;s made my routine so much easier. It doesn&#x27;t get super hot/blow super hard so I&#x27;m not how well it would work for thicker hair, but for my hair it&#x27;s been absolutely perfect. It gives me a little lift at the roots and makes my hair look styled. Not &amp;#34;I-just-came-from-the-salon&amp;#34; styled, but &amp;#34;I care&amp;#34; styled :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said and done, this is worth the price I paid for it! Would love to buy another one maybe with a slightly smaller barrel to try out a different look once in a while too!</li>
    <li> It does everything I expected it to and my hair seems to be healthier and shinier than ever. It works!</li>
    <li> Yes, I really like my John Frieda Brush. It is a good product. I recommend it. My hair looks very shine and smooth when I used my brush, even though I was using ion hair, John Frieda Brush is better. I only wish that the temperature bottom could be  design in other way; it is not a very good design. I think John Frieda would like change or innovate it.</li>
    <li> Its just ok. No magic. Convenient though and easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> My hair is medium length fine and thin so I need to be careful what I use to prevent breakage.  I was skeptical about buying this brush/dryer combo based on previous reviews that it was bulky and heavy but after my old combo brush unit (now discontinued) broke, I thought I would give it a try.  So glad I did!  I have been using it now for a couple months and find the larger barrel easy to use and the grip is quite ergonomic.  It dries my hair in about 1/2 the time as my old unit and doesn&#x27;t get caught in my hair.  It really does tame fly aways and leaves your hair smooth and silky!</li>
    <li> Yes, I wait until my hair is lightly damp.  But there&#x27;s no more round brushing sections for forever and wondering how it&#x27;s going to turn out.  It always turns out the same, even after using dry shampoo &amp; just \\&quot;touching it up\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This came along with some other items I had purchased and it Still arrived way, way, wayyyy earlier than expected! Which is a plus for me! A bonus on top of the fact that this Hot Air Brush is literally PERFECT!!! I&#x27;m sorry if any others are having a tough experience with it -(haven&#x27;t read any of the other comments, I&#x27;m just saying just in case)- but This brush is heaven for me! No more blow drying &amp; straightening with a comb or brush with two hands for me anymore! And just to help you out, not that I think it matters what race you are -[THiS brush will be great for Anybody]- but for any girl or guy that is African American out there, this brush works really, really great for all hair types! {Just start at your ends &amp; work your way easily to your roots. But duh right? ^_^} It&#x27;s super, super easy and I love, love, love this brush. It&#x27;s My New Best Friend! And thank you Amazon for the great price! Great Buy! Would buy from the seller again!</li>
    <li> worth of your money, Works good and gives better shape, shine and glow to your hair. Great for your money</li>
    <li> It works pretty well but it doesn&#x27;t smooth my hair as much as I&#x27;d hoped.  I hoped it would replace round-brushing my hair with a hair dryer, but it definitely did not.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually do the reviews but I decided since I rely on them so heavily I would throw my 2 cents in.  I like this product.  I have some unusual waves in my hair and this really helps with a nice end result - smooth with a slight curl (where I want it).  My hair is shoulder length and medium in thickness.  I have to agree there is not a lot of power to dry hair quickly, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to risk it being hotter than it is.  I wait until my hair is almost dry (if I&#x27;m in a hurry I use the regular blow dryer to get the moisture out) and then I use this to style my hair.  The one thing I would like to see is a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button instead of just the cool setting on the switch - I find it a little awkward to switch in mid curl.  It took a little getting used to, but as I said before - I like it!</li>
    <li> The only thing I do not like is that while I am in the process of drying my hair, the handgrip switch to the cool position (top, I notice it because the hot air is not coming out, just cool air, suddenly I have to switch it back...it sure become a pain in the neck sometimes. That I consider to be a bad product design, the maker place the position somewhere else where away from the grip itself. Hope I could make this clear.&lt;br /&gt;This is why a rate the \\&quot;John Frieda Hot Air Brush\\&quot; a 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is easy to handle and use.  I have not had any problem with it getting too hot.  ANd I find the brushes to be soft and gentle on the scalp.  My hair is fairly short (not to shoulder) and rather fine and the John Frieda Hot Air Brush with the 1.5 inch diameter brush roller is just absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> USE THIS ALL THE TIME, WORKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  Thanks for all the reviews for this I decided to take a chance on it and my hair is looking so much better then with my old dryer and brush.  Thank you Amazon for having products we can&#x27;t find locally.</li>
    <li> I have use this item for a while now and not too fond of it. First of all, you have to dry your hair using a separate blowdryer, then after you do that, section off your hair, then you can use this item, start with small pieces of your hair, 1 inch, and I guess you can achieve the look you are desiring that way. My suggestion, don&#x27;t buy this product and just do what you are doing now. Which is what I do now.</li>
    <li> New favorite hair tool! Saves me from dropping the brush and/or hair dryer half a dozen times while trying to style my hair. Hair turns out beautifully, and it&#x27;s so simple. So much easier than using a round brush and hair dryer. Since my hair is mostly dry before starting with the brush it works very quickly. I really like how easy the brush is to handle, and how light weight it is. I also prefer this to my usual round brush because it doesn&#x27;t snag or tangle my hair at all. Very gentle on my hair and leaves it shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of the complaints/low ratings seem to be from people who didn&#x27;t follow, or don&#x27;t like, the instruction to dry hair at least 80% of the way before using this brush. My hair stylist has always told me to do that before using a round brush at the end, so not sure what the big deal is. Also, some talk about it being too hot. I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t get too hot; since I have a sensitive scalp, heating tools (curling irons and straight irons) generally feel way too hot near my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a great product!!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I used this hot air brush for the first time this morning and I had to get online right away to write my review. My results were perfect! I have used tons of styling equipment over the years because of my complicated hair - medium to medium long thick fine hair with tons of waves and some natural curl. This combination makes it difficult to find the right styling instruments in one product. But I&#x27;ve found it with this. I was able to completely dry and style my hair with it after towel drying and adding my normal TIGI Small Talk hair product. I have used hot air brushes before and have been unimpressed. But I decided to give this brush a try because of the favorable reviews and because I need to cut down my hair prep time (I&#x27;m a full-time nursing student in my last semester of clinicals with a family (including a 3 year old!). With this hot air brush, I got smooth beautiful hair with just enough curl to create a nice curl under for a nice bob look. Normally I need a large barrel curling iron to curl my long-ish bangs and create the bob look that I desire. I didn&#x27;t need it at all! I think the size of the brush is great. It seems on the small size when I first opened it up but it really is best to use it in smaller size sections which I think is what helped to create my perfect style the first time around. I&#x27;m SO HAPPY with this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE this blowdrying brush. You only need one hand to style and dry your hair AND my hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled when using it. My Daughter hates having her hair brushed and blowdryed due to tangles and it taking forever. But with this thing she has no pain, no tangles and it dryers her hair fast. We love it and I&#x27;ve told all of my friends about it. I want to buy another one just to keep in my daughters bathroom.</li>
    <li> So so, not the best, not the worst.  I probably should have researched better</li>
    <li> I purchased this after having lost my Conair Brush due to the good reviews.  The first time I even turned it on it sounded weaker.  When using this brush I found it to not function as well and make nice voluminous curls as the Conair brush.  Also the Conair brush has a cool tip at the end to aid in the curling of hair .  Sending this back because its inferior.  If you want a great product go with the Conair, I have long hair and the Conair works so much better. Dont waste your time with this.  Maybe everyone else who gave it glowing reviews never tried the Conair one so they dont know better!</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast and did not match my expectations;</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it for drying and usually use it for touchups or styling after my hair is almost completely dry.  Otherwise it dries my fine hair too much.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Will probably buy another and keep in box until this one dies.  It is so easy to get your hair dry, styled, and looking great all with one product.  I don&#x27;t even use my flat iron anymore and my hair is much healthier because of it.  I would recommend this for maybe shorter hair, although my friend used it on vacation on her longer hair to get volume at the roots.  Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a month ago so have had some time to work with it.  The big thing to remember is that you should really dry your hair about 90% with a regular blow dryer first..you don&#x27;t have to style at all just run the dryer on it.  Once you get to that point them use this brush to finish and style.  Leaves your hair styled and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had gotten one a while ago...oh and I had tried an auto roller one and prefer this as the roller one you can get tangled very easily and pull your hair out until you get use to it.</li>
    <li> It seems okay, I accidentally ordered, I wanted one that spins but this seems like it will get the job done</li>
    <li> Best hot air brush I have ever had!  It straightens my curly hair in only a few minutes as I dry it, and does not damage my hair.  I don &#x27;t need to use my straightener as much.  So glad my other air brush quit working.  It saves me a lot of time, and is much easier on my hair.  Only wish it was dual voltage for travel to Europe.</li>
    <li> I have thin, straight hair so I was hoping this product was going to give me some volume at the roots. I was really disappointed! It never gets hot enough to actually make a difference even on its highest setting. I should have returned it but I tossed the box.</li>
    <li> Bought the product unwrapped it and then discovered that the power to be used was 110. In Australia it is 240 volts Dont remember seeing this opn the ad for this product box opened cannot return</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush!  It smoothes out my hair as I dry it.  When used in combination with John Frieda smoothing crème, it is amazing.</li>
    <li> The brush 500 watt temperature is good for styling without drying out the ends.  Hair is soft and shiny, not fuzzy.  I wish the barrel were  1 1/4 instead of 1 1/2 inches so I could get a little more curl in my short hair.  I find the 1 inch barrel doesn&#x27;t result in a smooth look.</li>
    <li> I bought it for myself for Christmas.  I have very fine hair.  I thought this would be great in helping to give my hair more body.  It actually burned my hair.  My stylist told me that I should throw it away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it is good for some hair types - but fine hair...no way.</li>
    <li> I have super curly thick hair and don&#x27;t get me wrong this thing works but it takes me almost 2 hours to finish my hair with it. I use it as my last resort when i have no blow dryer. It is good for making big round curls or volume at the ends of your hair but you have to roll your hair up in it and let it sit for like 5-10 seconds. Like i said before it works but if you have thick hair and don&#x27;t want to spend 1-2 hours drying your hair then don&#x27;t get this. Maybe they should make a more powerful one with a bigger roll, that might work better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably owned 5 or 6 hot air brushes by different manufacturers. This is head and shoulders above all the others: well designed--compact and sturdy. The brush part is supported in a unique way because that is the part that gets the most stress and is always the part that fails first. The bristles really grab the hair. The only down side and it&#x27;s a very small one is that the sliding on/off lever/button is somewhat difficult to move. Regardless, I&#x27;d definitely buy again and strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazing tool.  I never mastered using a round brush while blow drying.  This solves that problem.  Easy to use.  If I can do it, anyone can!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo7HLO0ALOIOJI]]To all my naturally curly/frizzy sisters out there!  This product is gold!!!  for many years I have been using the blow dryer with several round brushes, ( small for the front, large for the back, etc)  and then after all that using the flat iron/ curling iron to smooth... pretty much an hour long/ overheated session in my bathroom that I never looked forward to.  In fact I was contemplating going to walmart or wherever and paying for a blowout a couple times a week.  Well, NO MORE!!!!!  This works!!!  All you do is, 1.  Use your blow dryer to get your hair 75% dry ( and I know you have one). 2. take this baby and finish off!!  thats all!!  about 10 minutes with the blow dryer and 5-10 with this, depending on your hair thickness and length!!  I don&#x27;t even use my flat iron anymore unless I want poker straight and the curling iron is history!!  The bonus is you only need one hand with this!  Check for messages on your iphone, play a game...Bonus!!  I just purchased another one because as we all know, when you really love a product, they stop selling it, right?  so I definitely want a back up until I get to the old lady stage where I just go for a \\&quot;set\\&quot; every week... oh I hope that day never comes! lol  ps I like this product so much I took pics to show you and then it seems they only want videos?  Im gonna try to upload pics with imovie, we&#x27;ll see...</li>
    <li> it is an okay hair brush. i expected to be sturdier then it is. i will keep it but there is nothing special about it</li>
    <li> This product is not what it&#x27;s crack up to be. Bought it for virgin hair. It was pulling locks of hair out.&lt;br /&gt;Very bad idea.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair so it makes it look thinner than it is. I was a bit skeptical about using this but decided to take a chance. Am so glad I did too. I don&#x27;t use it every day but I do use it when I go out for a meal, etc. You use it once your hair is dry. It heats up almost instantly. I was pleasantly surprised at the volume. You can use hairspray in sections before using it and it will hold longer. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with being burned by this or by it being too hot.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once. When I figured out what temperature to use, it worked great. So as long as it last like this, I will be very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an edit a few weeks later. It is ok, I am not really using it enough. It takes a long time especially on wet hair. So the hair dryer has returned.</li>
    <li> I love the way this brush works, so simple.  Now I don&#x27;t go to my hairdresser as frequently, since I can now style my own hair.  So I&#x27;m saving lots of money.</li>
    <li> So disappointed! I had really hoped I found a hair gadget that would work on my hair. All the positive reviews couldn&#x27;t be wrong. But alas, maybe the other reviews gave me unrealistic expectations... Or maybe I&#x27;m just an optimist and wanted to believe that this product really was that good. It didnt work for me, and I will be returning for sure. I even watched the videos to make sure I knew how to use it. I was even going to give it a second chance... But by the end I was so frustrated there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping the hot air brush would do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Help cut some time with the hair dryer. It did not! I let my (long, semi-thick) hair air dry for 30 minutes and found I still had to dry with the blow dryer for another few minutes. The brush did not dry my hair AT ALL. I don&#x27;t have time for that in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Get rid of those awful lines I always seem to get in the same spot because my hair is too long to use a brush and dry at the same time. It did not! I used the brush over the hair...under the hair...made several slow passes... I can do it in seconds with my straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Add some volume at the roots. Nope. I used the brush exactly how you are supposed to: Hold for 10 seconds or so at the roots, slowly pull brush up. No volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Add shine and control frizz. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with frizz unless it is super humid, and I didn&#x27;t notice an increase in shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Be easy to maneuver around my head. The design is difficult to manage. My hands are small, and it was difficult to hold and control the brush. I lost a few bristles taking it out of the package, and it doesn&#x27;t have many to begin with, so a few lost during each use is substantial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to try this product, then try it. It didn&#x27;t work for me, but I&#x27;m apparently in a minority because the majority of reviewers loved it.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for my thick hair. I had a &#x27;gold &amp; hot&#x27; one that broke after 10 years and was hoping to replaces it with this. This has a shorter barrel and doesn&#x27;t blow hard enough to dry my hair. This might work to finish hair once it&#x27;s been dried, but it won&#x27;t dry toweled thick hair.</li>
    <li> This product has really changed my attitude about blow drying my hair.  I would watch in envy as my stylist used a blow dryer and round brush seamlessly on my hair and it came out looking amazing.  Whenever I would try this at home, my problems would range from an exhausted arm, to dropping the brush, to having to turn the blow dryer off and on in order to maneuver the brush, etc...  With this hot air brush, my problems are solved.  I let my hair dry to about 70 percent and then use this.  I get volume, shine and tons of compliments on my hair.  I even confessed to my stylist about this product and she told me that she bought one for her young daughter.  I have recommended this product to so many people, that I lost count</li>
    <li> Took way too long to dry hair and didn&#x27;t even look good when I was done. Probably not for people with curly or frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this hot air brush so much i ordered the I&#x27; air brush as well. Takes the place of a blow dryer and round brush. It is very comfortable to use and now it takes less than half the time to dry and style my hair.  I have very fine medium length hair that soaks up water like a sponge so it used to take a bit of time to first damp dry and then style.  Great product!</li>
    <li> very easy to use, very easy to work with. Nice long cords. different level of heat can choose. remember to use prevent hair damage from heat product before you use high heat level to style your hair.</li>
    <li> Worked well when I got it but died after only two months!! Very disappointed and apparently I can&#x27;t return it! Great!</li>
    <li> I bought two from this buyer. First one burned after couple months. I&#x27;ve got a new one. I&#x27;ve short hair and use it three times a week.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have thick and unruly hair, and this makes it sleek and shiny.</li>
    <li> My hair was very, very long and I am very, very uncoordinated. I have never been able to handle doing a blow out on myself with the brush and the hair dryer and all my hair, I need like 5 more hands. This solves that problem completely! It basically is like giving myself a blow out and it&#x27;s as easy as picking up my hair and brushing this dryer through it. It does take a very long time to dry hair straight out of the shower. The directions even recommend drying the middle sections of your hair a little before using this if you have very long hair. If I had the time, I would just use this anyways because I loved the whole effect in the end. If I was very short on time, I would dry my hair with a normal blow dryer and then go over the top parts of my hair to make it look nice and sleek. This is amazing for reducing frizz!!! It is also great to give extra volume if you hold the dryer at your roots for a little bit before dragging it down.</li>
    <li> When reading a product review, it&#x27;s important to know what the writer&#x27;s needs were, to evaluate if their advice is applicable to yourself. So I will say, I have very fine, medium short, straight hair and this is a fabulous hot brush for my type of hair. The wider diameter of the wand gives me the slight curve under I want, and very soft bristles do not rip my hair out. My hair dries in literally less than three minutes. If you have thick, long, wavy, coarse hair this is not the brush for you.</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough</li>
    <li> This is the best styling tool I own!&lt;br /&gt;I  am fairly incompetent when it comes to doing hair. I can put in a pony tail, maybe a headband or barrette and even managed a messy bun on occasion. I have pretty fine hair that is fairly straight buy not that pretty sleek straight just blah hang there with occasional waves.  I absolutely adore the ease of this tool. I can style and dry simultaneously and style my hair. I can get great body and shine while straightening out those funky parts in my hair. It is simple enough that I can do it.</li>
    <li> Like this better than my Infinity curling brush!  The smaller barrel creates the look I want.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this is PERFECT for it. It does not work as great on my daughter&#x27;s hair since her hair is super thick.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as a curler - I use it to straighten out my hair in the morning. I sometimes go to bed with my hair wet and end up with weirdly shaped hair in the morning. This is much better than a straightening tool because it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair as much.&lt;br /&gt;However my hair does tend to get tangled in the brush a lot. Not that it doesn&#x27;t happen with other brushes so I won&#x27;t take points off for that. Overall very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I have very limited use of my hands because of a spinal cord injury and I have a short stacked bob hair cut so drying it while using a round brush is not possible for me. I often go to my hair dresser just to get my hair styled because it looks so much better when its done with a round brush. This item has helped me a lot. Is it perfect, no, but that&#x27;s just because of my limitations. I personally would benefit more from a smaller handle and harder bristles because my hair is thick even though it&#x27;s short. I&#x27;m also afraid of burning my hand on the very top part of it while trying to hold my hair around the brush. But like I said it does make my hair look healthier, shinier, and more polished. It&#x27;s not hanging there looking lifeless. It gives me good volume. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used something like this and I don&#x27;t feel the need to keep looking for another one.</li>
    <li> Brush was used and had lots of dark hair on the bristles</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the reviews &amp; because I&#x27;m completely uncoordinated with styling tools.  The first time I got it I thought no way is this thing going to dry my extremely thick, shoulder- touching hair. This tool must be for people with thin hair.  But to my surprise it dried it &amp; it didn&#x27;t take all that long.  I got lots of compliments &amp; I didn&#x27;t even have to use a curling iron. Smooth, cute curls!  I&#x27;m lazy so I wanted to try cutting down on the drying time.  So, the next time I dried it with my Solia Thermal Ionic (love it- dries my hair 10 min flat whereas normal hair dryer 30 min) more 60-70% as suggested but I didn&#x27;t get as nice a curl and it was frizzier.  So here&#x27;s my tips:  I first dry my hair upside down about 60-70%.  Then, as another reviewer suggested,  I use a flat nozzle to dry the crown &amp; roots.  Next, dry it like the hairdressers do&#x60; pulling &amp; rolling, pulling &amp; rolling.  Lastly, unless I&#x27;m in a hurry, I place each dried piece on those self-grip rollers until cool.  Voila!</li>
    <li> Styles quickly with lots of volume; does not burn my hair and the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle.  Very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> I use this after blow drying my hair.  It makes it smoother and curls the ends under really well.  I really like this!</li>
    <li> Worked  really well for the five times I was able to use it. Then one day it caught on fire. Really angry because of how well it does work and there isn&#x27;t a replacement policy</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does an awesome job styling and straightening. very easy to use....gets hot but not too hot. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> it is perfect, i&#x27;m so happy to get this. I have curly hair and with this I can style them.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, easier to use than brush and blow dryer. But the tip does get quite hot as others have said. Other than that, I would recommend this prodiuct!</li>
    <li> This has cut the time to do my hair in half! The reviews sounded too good to be true, but it works great! Much easier to use than a brush and blow dryer- grabs the hair, comes out smooth and shiny, easy on the wrist and arms. I have grey hair that has frizzies and this totally smooths them out. Dries my hair very quickly. I love this product!!!! I have had similar items in the past that really did not work that well or burned my fingers but this one is great!!</li>
    <li> this is for people that have a hard time working the round brush and holding a blowdryer. this is a wuick way to dry/straighten your hair, it makes ur hair look soft everytime. :)</li>
    <li> I like this hot air brush although it is a little awkward to handle.  A slightly thinner handle and a natural bristle brush would be easier to handle and better for your hair.</li>
    <li> I  wish  I  had  discovered  this  sooner.  It  is  so  perfect  for  my  wavy  hair.  I  have gotten  keratin treatments  and  Japanese  straightening  in the past  but  with  this  hot air  brush  my  hair  looks  great and  is  smoothed out  enough  after  I  wash  it  so  that  I  don&#x27;t  think I  will  need  to  get  treatments  any  more. I  think that  It also  helps  to  use some  argon  oil  on my  hair  after  I  wash it.</li>
    <li> Great price, but, I have thick, coarse hair. On a scale of 1-10 mine is a 7 for curly/wavy and a 7 for thickness. My hair was definitely smoother, but my flat iron does a better job in the same amount of time.  I&#x27;ve used other hot air brushes and they had fewer bristles and the hair came in contact with the barrel more. It think this contact is key for hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on my friends&#x27;s fine hair and it worked great!</li>
    <li> Not impressed. I read the other reviews and thought I would be a me to get soft curls and volume. It does dry your hair but doesn&#x27;t add the height or softness I was looking for. My hair is a medium length, layered bob and I am back to using my old, big barrel curling iron for waves.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does a nice job, saves a step by drying and curling at the same time.  Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I usually do not write reviews, but I love this product! I have never had a hot air brush before. I used my stepmothers and thought it would be a great idea to have one for touch ups or styling. She had a smaller version with hard bristles (they hurt and got tangled). I must say I love this one a lot more!!! The bristles are soft and so far my hair hasn&#x27;t gotten tangled in them. I have very fine hair and this works great. The hair dryer is not too loud, which is a bonus. The tip does get a bit hot. Love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and this works well.  Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t tangle up.  A good way to finish drying your hair and give it some style.</li>
    <li> I love this, it is so much fun to use. It is super light and easy. I always had trouble doing the right side of my hair and having to hold both a brush and a dryer. I have long hair that is somewhat straight and wavy but super thick. I thought the bristles might be harsh but they are soft and do not damage my hair. It did make my hair more shiny too. I let my hair dry almost 90% and then use this. What fun!  I love brushing it through. If you have long hair, you probably should get the 1.5 inch. There are not many options in 1.5 inch so I&#x27;m glad they made this.&lt;br /&gt;Now I do think that if you are looking for a serious styling tool or dryer, then this is probably not for you. But  if you like more casual, natural styles you might like this. I am definitely glad I purchased and will be giving as gifts too.</li>
    <li> My hair is short and thick.  I&#x27;ve tried many hot air brushes over the years but this brush is the best.  My hair stays in the brush without the ends flying out and running wild.  The cord does not twist like many brushes, and I found that 500 watts was more than enough to style my slightly damp hair.  It is a brush I will recommend.</li>
    <li> I like I can dry and curl hair at the same time. It gives the body my hair needs.great buy!</li>
    <li> This takes too long to dry your hair. I like to use it after I have almost dried my hair with a regular hair dryer. It helps to put some body into the hair and turn the ends under but just too time consuming for drying.</li>
    <li> I use this tool regularly on my wavy, fine hair.  It styles quickly, with its 3 settings and the ionics smooth as it dries.  Great for bob haircuts, and love the cool setting!  So glad I ordered this.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush and does make your hair look nice but it is not the one which turns around as I thought it was.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair short (shoulder length) and this hot air brush has been great in creating that little curve in the end of my hair. It&#x27;s very easy to use for the back as well. It is relatively compact and I am planning to bring it for traveling or to the gym. It kind of creates the effect of a blow out and doesn&#x27;t really leave your hair frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t think this will work very well to create curls like curly irons. I think it would work best on short hair</li>
    <li> Perfect styler for short hair!!  I also have some arthritis issues and this product is lightweight and easy to use!</li>
    <li> This is a great hot, warm, cold hair tool. It works great for adding body and fullness to my hair. It has a nice long cord and isn&#x27;t too noisy. The slider switch requires a little fineness as it is a slider and not a flip side to side switch but no biggie it works great.</li>
    <li> what an awesome tool!  My hair looks fantastic daily now.  Instead of blow drying and trying to turn my brush to get smooth curl at ends, then when that fails to touch up with flat/curling iron on humid days....I now simply blow dry my hair quickly and easily with this little number.  I&#x27;m doing a better job than my hairdresser.  Easy to use, not a &#x27;hot&#x27; to touch item, turn it on and go to work.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine straight hair, 5 inches below my chin is length.  This fluffs it up, leaves a small curl/curve and bounce and body.</li>
    <li> I love my new hot air brush by John Freida because it is less harsh on my fine hair than the last Revlon one I had.  It does dry fast and styles my fine, short hair.</li>
    <li> Does not work like I thought it would. I tried drying my hair most of the was and tried with my hair mostly damp both ways i didnt get the results i was looking for. I still neeed to use my straightner and curling iron. I have naturally curly hair and when i brush it out it gets frizzy. So when I used this my tight curls were gone but i felt like It looked like i just brushed my hair. It just got frizzy. I may look around for a different brand beacuse I have seen these things work and it would save me time if it did.</li>
    <li> This air brush was used three times, mostly because I didn&#x27;t like it.  It quit working in less then 6 mos. after using it 3 times.  It did a terrible job with my hair.  Don&#x27;t buy it!!!</li>
    <li> The first one I got was having electrical issues, it&#x27;s like it wouldn&#x27;t run at a steady level.  It was easy enough to exchange it for a new one though. And they shipped it right away so I never went without one.</li>
    <li> After my favorite hot air brush died, I looked for a replacement and found this John Frieda brush. Now I wish my old brush had failed years ago! This brush is considerably smaller and lighter than most, yet very effective. Used together with the John Frieda Anti-Frizz spray, my hair is silkier and smoother than ever before, even in humid conditions. I have shoulder-length average thickness hair, and absolutely love this brush for drying and styling!</li>
    <li> Love it, love it. Works great. Leaves hair smooth and shinning.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, i have short wavy hair that gets frizzy. I usually use a big round metal brush and a blowdryer to do my hair than go over it with a flat iron. That usually takes forever and is a pain since i have my hands full and my brush usually tangles my hair and pull its out. This air brush is great, it blow drys my hair super fast,  half the time it used to take with the reg blowdryer and smoothes it out, i ordered the 1.5 inch and its a good size and my hair does not get tangled in it at all.  I used to have a similar brush by conair years ago that did not do as good of a job, it def didn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast and mostly blew my hair all over so it was messy and broke later on. This one does not blow my hair out of the brush and blow dries it pretty fast. im very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Does not even have enough power to blow dry my bangs, much less my hair which is fine and short.  Would not recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love this hot air brush.  Perfedct for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair and the wrong hot air brush can tangle in an instant.  This one made my hair amazingly shiny and silky and was very easy to work with.  I thought the brush was going to be too big in diameter but it was great.  Lots of volume with just the right bend to my layered bob.  I think I should probably buy a back up for it now while it is available.  I like it that much!</li>
    <li> I have never been able to manage a round brush and hair dryer the way the professionals do it.  My hair is thick and very frizzy and usually looks like a bush when I am done.  This brush/dryer actually works for me.  I have medium length hair and it ends up straight and smooth without a whole lot of effort.  I was dubious about trying it since I have bought a lot of hair equipment that did not work over many years.  I had given up on blow drying and reverted to rollers and a flat iron.  But even the first time I used this hot air brush I ended up with a decent blow dry.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use as described. I think it is better than the INFINITY one. However, it is not curl enough. Maybe the 1.0 inch would be better if you want to curl your hair obviously. I love it!</li>
    <li> I honestly expected more out of this product. The hairdryer part is weak, it takes forever to actually dry my hair and my hair is really thin which is always really easy to dry but not in this occasion. I think you need to have a lot of patience to actually do this everyday. Other than that, it&#x27;s nice looking and very light.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old revlon that died. So far nothing great. Barely gives my hair any wave.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to do my own blowout using a round brush. I&#x27;ve tried many times. I just don&#x27;t have the patience or the technical skill. This brush changed all of that! I dry my roots and partially dry the rest of my hair with my regular blow dryer and then go through my layers with this brush. It works great. I find that the end doesn&#x27;t get too hot as other reviewers have stated. As long as you just touch it with the tips of your fingers, it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
    <li> burnt out after 5 months.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with this tool. I use it on almost dry hair. It definitely adds a shine to dull blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;RoseVignettes.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Is so big for thin fine short hair need to make a smaller one</li>
    <li> My hair is too thick to be effective unless you want to section out a ton of pieces and take hours to dry.  But gave to my sister with short thinner hair and she loves it</li>
    <li> it has changed my life. everyone asks me how I got my hair to look like this. And normally I HATE spending time on my hair. This is awfully easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using a hard-bristled hot air brush for years, but wanted to try something else. I am really amazed at the professional looking results I get with this product. I don&#x27;t know if it is the soft bristles, or the cool setting (which I use after hot rolling a section of hair) but it lasts way longer than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried in this humidity here in south Florida! Kudos!</li>
    <li> This air brush straightens my hair more than it curls it.  It does soften the flyaway and adds some shine.  Have used it with a John Frieda blow out spray as well as another brand mousse.  Both did not produce the body or waves I was expecting.  That said, not many styling products work on my hair.  This is okay and I will keep it but probably not purchase again or recommend.</li>
    <li> I have relatively thick, very curly, short hair. I know people want my hair, but there are days when the humidity is low that I yearn for straight hair. I wasn&#x27;t excited about the idea of having to partially dry my hair before using this, but wow! Does it ever make &amp;#34;straightening&amp;#34; my hair easy. With a round brush and blow dryer on high heat, it would take me almost thirty minutes to get my hair dry (it&#x27;s chin length.) I dried my hair about 70% of the way and then used this hot air brush. It took me about 12 minutes total. I am not particularly talented with styling my hair, but this was so easy to use and I loved having my other hand free. When I got to a particularly stubborn spot, I could use my other hand to sort of hold the hair against the brush and pull it through my hair. Short of a Brazilian, this is a great tool.</li>
    <li> I thought it was pretty good...until it stopped working a month after I got it. I probably only got 10 uses out of it.</li>
    <li> For my hair thickness would like it to be a higher heat. I let my hair dry for an hour when I have time and use the curler brush</li>
    <li> Enough air movement that it dries hair quickly.  And the barrel doesn&#x27;t fall off, as happened with my previous revlon that had changable brushes</li>
    <li> I had this on my wish list, and received it for Christmas this year.  I have thick, wavy hair that is hard to control.  I blow dry it and it looks fine, but not very polished.  With the hot air brush, and I style my hair so that it looks sleek and smooth, while making the most of the natural wave.  It creates really nice curls that are easy to spray into place.  It&#x27;s very lightweight and not very loud.  I usually blow dry my hair about 80% dry, then switch to this to do the styling.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Love it, as good if not better than the $ $100 to $200 stylers/ dryers. Easy and quick. Just wish the control knob was a bit easier to put into hi heat mode, often seem to slide up to cool when I want hot and high.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair tool!  I have extremely thin, fine hair.  If left to its own it will just frizz and lay limp.  I have tried using a large barrel brush and blow dryer....but let&#x27;s be honest...my arms get way too tired and I&#x27;m just not coordinated enough.  This tool allows me to accomplish the same thing!  The button slides easily from hot to cold to lock in the curl and body.  The size of the barrel allows for body and slight curls.  If you want tight curls, try a smaller barrel.  Great addition to your tool kit!</li>
    <li> Great hot air brush. You can style your hair while it&#x27;s wet/damp and don&#x27;t need to use a curling iron afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking to buy a smaller size one as well.</li>
    <li> At first, I was skeptical and even though I read the reviews before I bought it, I kept it in the box for a month and continued to use my hairdryer. Then, I decided it is time to try it; I read John Frieda&#x27;s name on it and thought, this cannot be a bad product (No, I am not John&#x27;s relative or friend). So, I dried my hair first -- left it a bit dump - and proceeded to use the air brush: SPECTACULAR RESULTS!! WOW!&lt;br /&gt; The air brush is light, extremely easy to use, the hair gets styled within seconds (no additional brushes needed --unless if you aim for perfection, which is also possible to achieve with this air brush). It doesn&#x27;t get heated, the cord swivels elegantly without interrupting your work.&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, John Frieda for thinking Quality.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent tool. I just need to practice with it as I have natural wavy, fine hair and.</li>
    <li> But so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.  I think it is a substitute for a hair dryer and not a supplement.  But if other reviewers have some tips I am very open to learning more on how to use this.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to master using a round brush with my hair dryer, though, gosh knows I&#x27;ve tried!!  So I&#x27;ve been using a blower dryer and then a curling iron or straightener, depending on my mood.  This hot air brush is soooooo easy to use and produces nice natural looking waves.  The instructions suggested using a regular dryer if you are starting with really wet hair, which is what I do.  I get my hair fairly dry with my regular dryer and then switch to this to finish.  So much faster than using a curling iron.  My hair seems to be happier too since I switched to this, probably because this only goes to 500 watts - not so much heat on my hair.  Plus, I can touch up my hair if I need to - just use it for couple minutes and voila, my hair looks like I just did it.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use compare with regular brash and hair dryer. If I use only this product for drying hair, it takes long time, so I use this after I use regular hair dryer to dry well, so it saves time.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest and bet hot air brush that I have ever owned. So easy to use and fix my hair. Wonderful product</li>
    <li> This was easy to use. The light curl and lift I got when I use this held all day. I was able to use is right out of the box with ease</li>
    <li> it was used, there are lots of hairs on it</li>
    <li> I really like the design of this air brush; easy to manipulate and it does a nice job of styling.</li>
    <li> Great product. If you have thick hair it may take longer but it still works great!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the change that John Frieda made to this  product does not work as well as their original brush.</li>
    <li> I have fine straight hair, so it dries and shapes really fast.  So much easier than using a drier and a rounded brush.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and pretty high efficiency air brush for the price. The only downside is that the brush itself does not rotate. I have very long and thick hair, yet I manage to style it all with the airbrush alone without the need to use the hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair styling much easier and much quicker.</li>
    <li> Left my hair limp....think a larger brush would be better..</li>
    <li> Overall this product meets expectations.  I think the highest heat setting is too hot, even for wet hair.  The directions suggest you use a regular hair dryer before using the product, which was disappointing because I&#x27;d hoped to eliminate that step.  Also, I can&#x27;t get it to curl my hair and I have long, naturally-curly hair.  I believe this product is best for shorter, straighter styles.</li>
    <li> Just received this today and used right away. I have wavy/frizzy/thick hair, that I have never loved until now! I allowed my hair to air dry about halfway and then used this wonderful hot air brush. I used on my roots for volume and then smoothed out the ends. Fabulous! I could run my hands through my hair. My husband loved it too!</li>
    <li> Using this is so much easier than using a round brush + blow dryer. Not too loud either.</li>
    <li> Awesomeness ! I have a friend that has really curly (but soft ) hair and she looked beautiful ! As of from a Salon. It Dries quicker than a Blower . My hair looks like from the salon . Neatness and Fabulous .</li>
    <li> I use this every day......never overheats. Owned it a long time, and performance is still the same.</li>
    <li> I love this new comb/dryer combo! Only wish it had a small handle on the tip for easier curling.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me!</li>
    <li> While it makes my hair bouncy, I bought this to reduce frizz since my blow dryer wasn&#x27;t doing the job. My hair is even frizzier.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this at first, but the more I use it, the more I like it. The only thing I&#x27;d change is the switch from hot to cool. Cooling the curls before you take out the brush really helps set them, but the button is awkward. A push button elsewhere to cool it would have worked better.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life?  This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for coarse and frizzy hair like mine!  A little warning though, don&#x27;t over use at the highest setting as the heat level may take a toll on your tresses.</li>
    <li> Watch who you buy from. This was obviously used when I got it, but it was listed as new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this brush would be perfect if it had a longer barrel that rotated &amp; had a cool tip to hold as you&#x27;re styling your hair.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this.</li>
    <li> Soes not have significant air power.</li>
    <li> This combo brush / blow dryer frees up a hand and puts you back in control. I never quite mastered holding a brush in one hand and a blow dryer in the other:  keeping the tension correct on the hair, blow drying down at the right angle for maximum smoothness, doing it at all angles, and keeping it all going long enough to get my entire head of hair dried and styled. I always felt as if I needed another arm. By combining the brush and drying, you get much more control and a far better result. I spend less time drying my hair, and it looks so much better.</li>
    <li> I have longish hair - almost to my bra strap - and it has crazy textures.  The top layer is wavy, the underside is corkscrew curly.  I get out of the shower, towel dry my hair, apply my straightening/blow drying serum, get dressed/do makeup, and then go at my hair with this thing.  It does a great job drying, smoothing, and styling my hair.  I am completely defective with a round brush and a regular blow dryer, but this thing eliminates the klutz factor and more or less does the work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the first one I purchased died in less than 4 months.  I still bought another because I like it so much.</li>
    <li> If you have thick curly hair, don&#x27;t buy this because it won&#x27;t be able to style your hair. The heat is not hot enough. I have this and another similar brand that auto rotates but I found both to be useless, what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair, cut into a bob. I was hoping by buying this hot air brush, I could eliminate a step in my styling routine. Unfortunately, as others have mentioned, this really isn&#x27;t powerful enough to dry thick hair. So I use my blow dryer to get my hair mostly dry, and then I finish with the John Frieda Hot Air Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a &amp;#34;second&amp;#34; step, it&#x27;s fine. For people who have thin or fine hair, I think they could get by with just this device to dry and style. The barrel IS large, but for how I wear my hair, it&#x27;s perfect. It would not work for those wanting tight curls, in my opinion. So based on these limitations, I think because of the low price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed with this hot air brush. Have used conair models with more heat and power and for less $$$!!!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this air brush because it creates soft curls and decreases frizz. It is easy to use due to handle size and being fairly light weight. The bristles are soft, which my hair and  scalp appreciate! Price was good too through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have fine colored hair, so I avoid washing it every day to maintain the color, but it needs a refresh each morning so it doesn&#x27;t look flat. I absolutely love this air brush! It works perfectly to smooth out my hair on the mornings I skip a shampoo, and I also use it as a final step after a typical blow-dry when my hair is almost dry. The only issue I have is that since the air comes out in all directions, it can leave some fly-aways since you can&#x27;t dry downwards - but a quick smoothing with a lightweight cream in my hands solves the problem.</li>
    <li> If it had a non heat transferring knob on end of the brush, it would  be perfect.  Meanwhile it will have to do.</li>
    <li> This product has cut the time needed to do my hair in half. I hate holding a blow dryer and round brush in my hands at the same time. This product does it all. My coworkers have also noticed a difference since I have started using it. I have gotten comments about how healthy and voluminous my hair looks. Feel like I should order another just in case....would never go back to dryer and regular brush.  One of my best purchases.</li>
    <li> It would work better if it were not so damn hard to hold onto.  I can barely get my hand around it to make the curls in my hair.  My hands are tired after trying to do all the hard labor I thought would be helped by this.  I thought it would move some.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Just wish there was option for the entire brush portion to spin while heat is going. But overall this is amazing for the curlied headed that has problems getting the back of your head straight. Crisis averted!</li>
    <li> I have long, thicker hair, and this product, while it works, does not do the job faster than a regular hairdryer and roll brush. If I had thinner or shorter hair, it would definitely be more worth it. That being said, even though it took the same amount of time or longer to finish my hair, it worked. I always use the highest heat setting (and always use a regular hair dryer to get my hair mostly dry before I use this one). What I really liked is that my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle in the bristles, the cylinder is the perfect size and it gives me more volume at the base. If you have thin or short hair, this would definitely be a 4-5 star review.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like at all - the barrell was way too big for me and it would have taken way too long to dry my hair.  I returned it and went back to my regular blow dryer and round brush.</li>
    <li> I use this air brush primarily as a styling tool after a wet set and dry.  I use it as a blow out like a Dominican style blow out.  It has just the right amount of heat without damage. The roller size is a good size forming a loose curl.  I also use it in between shampoo and sets to maintain my style until the next set.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I find this way of styling sooner ! The cost was inexpensive. I love the easiness and the silky smooth finish to my hair after using it. :)</li>
    <li> OUTSTANDING PRICE FOR THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT...DOES WHAT IT CLAIMS..WORTH BUYING</li>
    <li> Definitely not for thick hair people!</li>
    <li> Makes my wife&#x27;s hair much fuller and she claims it will take a salon tech or stylist a lot of time to achieve the same result so it is definitely a good buy. I noticed the different in my wife&#x27;s hair after using this. It is as loud as a hair dryer or blower but worth it I think.</li>
    <li> Received this as a birthday gift and I don&#x27;t know how I didn&#x27;t know it existed sooner. As someone who&#x27;s spent years on smoothing treatments, keratin, flat irons, etc. - anything to get my frizzy, half curly/half wavy hair to be a little bit straighter and smoother - this has changed my life. I dry my hair about 75% (either with a dryer or air dry), and then go through in sections. It&#x27;s like using a round brush, except it actually stays shiny, silky, and smooth, like I just walked out of the salon after a blowout. I was amazed. I woke up this morning after using it last night and my hair is still just as smooth with a little volume/body on the ends, just how I like it. Plus, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting nearly as much heat damage as I did from flat irons and wands. Super glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for a couple years. I did try to use a different brand and found it didnt work for me. It just saddens me that after about 6 months of use they die. I have now purchased about 6 of these and wish they had a punch card program to get your 7th one free! Its a great product, it just doesnt last long.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair. This hot air brush gives it the lift it needs. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old conair one. I wish I&#x27;d kept the old one. The design is sturdy, but it doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to shape my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the John Frieda hair brush, only wish the handle was a bit smaller.  I have small hands and it&#x27;s hard to grip and hold for anything length of time with the larger handle.  Other than that dryer power is great!</li>
    <li> This is easy to use, and was purchased on the advice of a friend. It does my hair very well, but takes a huge amount of time. I went back to my basic hair blower, and use this one occasionally as a &amp;#34;finishing touch&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I would like it better if the air flow was stronger than it is.</li>
    <li> Works great for adding lots of volume to my hair.  Makes my hair look straight but full.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I have rather long hair but it is not extraordinarily thick. This takes much, much longer than blow drying and using a curling iron or straightener. My hair is difficult but I am only really able to flip the ends, not really create and large, nice curls but that might just be mine. Not a bad product but I am not in love with it!</li>
    <li> This is my second John Frieda Hot air brush.  The first one lasted about two years, not bad when you consider how often you use it and the low cost.  I looked around to see if I could find anything newer that might be better but couldn&#x27;t find anything so ordered this one again.  It dries fast and leaves my hair frizz free.</li>
    <li> This is definitely easier than using a round boarshair brush, and smooths better than a paddle brush, but it doesn&#x27;t get your hair anywhere as smooth as a round brush blowout by a professional.  I have been using it after mostly drying my hair with a regular blowdryer as this is quite weak.  I have super thick curly hair and it does help smooth my hair but for special occasions I will still get a professional blow out.</li>
    <li> This hot air brush has changed the way I feel about my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use and effective.&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry my hair to about 80% then use this guy.  My hair is smooth without being stick straight and flat. The shine is great and I don&#x27;t have any frizz.  The smoothness easily equals the best straightening treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Great for initial styling and the next morning touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;Pluses: The cord is a generous length and swivels at the base, keeping the cord out of the way.  Brush is compact, which makes it easy to pack.&lt;br /&gt;Although the blower isn&#x27;t super-powerful, it works quickly.  Better than expected when I first turned it on.&lt;br /&gt;Minus: like other reviewers, I&#x27;d like to see some sort of handle at the top end, to improve control.  The plate is okay, but it does get hot to the touch after a few minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value, I&#x27;m going to buy a back-up!</li>
    <li> Great hot air brush and the perfect size to lift up short straight hair. I like the fact that you have a couple of speeds and temps for drying.</li>
    <li> This styler is just the right size, weight, heat for easy drying and styling.  My hair is long so I predry with my regular dryer and finish with this.</li>
    <li> Works great with my curly hair. Like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to dry my hair before I use this hot air brush. I also don&#x27;t burn my fingers.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! I actually bought this thinking it was something else and was pleasantly surprised. If you love the blowout that you get from the stylist then buy this thing. Basically you plug it in and turn it on and air comes out of the brush. So you can use one hand to manuever your hair and the other to work the brush while it is blow drying your hair. My hair is very thick and this thing works great for a nice blowout.</li>
    <li> I like the hairdryer! it allows me to style my hair without having to hold a brush.  It gives me a lot more control.  My hair is wavy and tends to frizz and this creates a smoother finish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the hot air styling brush. It is easy to use. I just wish it would get a little hotter.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time holding a brush in one hand and a hair dryer in the other....this is the perfect solution.  I have a lot of hair so I dry my hair first with my blowdryer and when its about 80% dry I use the hot air brush.  I can actually brush/dry the back of my hair now with this which was a very difficult feat in the past.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Overall effective at what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Heats quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The tip of the brush gets very hot, and unfortunately, it&#x27;s hard to get the hair around the brush as tightly as you want without needing to hold it there briefly.  I do it, but you have to be careful... gets very hot.&lt;br /&gt;The power cord should be a little longer to make it easier to work with.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is short and it does not get tangled in my hair, another plus is it leaves my hair shiny, The downside is it seems to take much longer to dry my hair - it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as or blow as forcefully as my other hot air brush. Another thing is the bristles are really soft. It brushes okay but I kind of miss the feel of firm bristles against my scalp- my hair is straight and cut in a short angled bob so I don&#x27;t need a lot of time to style it for it to look presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like most is the feel of this in my hand-the grip is good, it feels substantial but light weight, The swivel cord works and it is easy to use because it is a couple of inches shorter than my Revlon hot air brush. I&#x27;m glad i got it but it really takes much too long to get my hair dry and since it is summer I often leave with very damp hair. It isn&#x27;t too noisy and the cool option is nice.</li>
    <li> I have long coarse frizzy hair curly hair and this tool works great.. Takes a little time because with my frizzy hair I have to go over each section a few times but well worth the $</li>
    <li> I love the hot air brush because it is easy to use and does not get too hot.&lt;br /&gt;But because my hair is short I only wish it had a smaller brush choice</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice for styling your hair smoothly and adding a little bounce to your ends.  I have had the best results with it after almost fully drying my  hair and then take it into sections and use this to smooth and add a little bounce.  If you want a real curl then go for a curling iron.  For the record I have Caucasian slightly wavy hair that I usually blow out straight with a regular curl brush and my hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It styles my thick, curly, shoulder length hair perfectly.  It gets plenty hot.  Any hotter and I would have to wear a glove.  I got used to the thick handle with in days and now i dont even notice it.  It straightens my curly, frizzy hair and smooths.  I do not pre-dry because I find if I start out with it wet, its more smooth at the end.  Its also great for touching up on dry hair the next day if needed.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t work very well...</li>
    <li> update 6/20/15 it overheated and smoked on me today. it lasted a little over 2 yrs. it does have a 3 yr manufacturers warranty that I just might have to take advantage of.  it was used daily, so I didn&#x27;t think it would last forever.. it has lasted double the amount of time other brands and models have lasted me...&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt; bought this at target for more than its offered here, and it works awesome. quality styling tool. it has the two different type bristles and it minimizes fly aways. i have fine, thin, wavy shoulder length hair and it works great to smooth it out into my bob style.it also makes my hair super shiny. my hair gets frizzy in humidity and it seems to keep it smooth. i had a cheap con air hot brush and it blew way too hot and fried my hair. this one blows hot but not so hot that you can&#x27;t touch the brush as you do your hair. its also 500v which to me is adequate. i don&#x27;t believe i ever owned a hot air brush with more voltage, so this isn&#x27;t an issue for me. bottom line, buy through amazon and get it cheaper, its worth the price, which is cheap compared to the ones you can buy for 100 bucks that would probably do the exact same thing as this one.</li>
    <li> It works better if your hair is already dry... And I feel that its only good to style the hair tips.&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure if I would recommend this product, specially if you think of use it as a hair dryer... However it does make my hair look shinier!!!</li>
    <li> yes.  i hit on a stocking stuffer gift for her for xmas that she actually likes and uses and comments on.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was a bit doubtful but wanted to try this, and was really pleased to see it works great. I&#x27;d have liked the barrel to have been a bit smaller for my medium length hair, but it does dry and give hair a nice shine and slight curl. I don&#x27;t think it would work as well on thick hair unless smaller sections are used.</li>
    <li> Did not work like described. Product was more  so a hair dryer. My hair is very dry and thick coarse. Product did opposite of what I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works pretty well but next time I would have purchased something with more power. Dries hair very slowly</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hot air brush!  It works so well that I purchased one for a friend due to the coarseness of her hair.  My hair is thick, but fine and difficult to hold style.  This product works great on my hair and gives me the volume that I want and creates a nice, smooth style.  Not only would I recommend to a friend, I actually purchased one for a friend due to how great it works!</li>
    <li> it does definitely add volume to my hair, which i got it for. i&#x27;m satisfied! thank you. :) :0 :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product.I found it easy to use and it made my hair shiny and no frizz.I was so impressed that I bought it for my daughter .</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on December 4th as a Christmas gift.  My daughter used it from December 26 - January 28. I LOVED IT, for the 4 weeks it worked and then it burnt out.  I turn it on and it smells like it&#x27;s burning.  Now it says I can&#x27;t return it...Not worth the $32+</li>
    <li> Bought this specifically for travel, so I was disappointed at its size.  Maybe good for at-home use, but no small enough for travel.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> this product is light, makes big curls and easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;which the brush could be a little more fluffy..</li>
    <li> This product is unbelievably easy to use and the results are incredible even with curly unruly hair!</li>
    <li> Really like this, is loud though.  Wish it was quieter.  Still very good.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST HOT AIR BRUSH I&#x27;VE EVER USED. IT LIFTS LONG HAIR WITH EASE. IT DRYS FASTER DUE TO THE LARGER BRUSH. IT IS MUCH QUIETER. THE SWIVEL CORD IS WONDERFUL. IT IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO USE.  FRIEDA SHOULD RE-DESIGN THE BUTTON CONTROL FOR EASIER USE.</li>
    <li> I bought this on an Amazon lightning deal during Christmas and it&#x27;s one of my most favorite purchases ever from Amazon.  I actually left it in the box for a couple weeks after receiving it because I was nervous that I wouldn&#x27;t know how to use it.  As soon as I opened it, I wished I would have opened it sooner.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and my hair really does look like I just stepped out of the salon.  I have never been good at using a round brush with a hair dryer so I always resorted to using a Chi straightener and then using a fat curling iron to curl the ends.  Now I don&#x27;t use either of those tools.  I do have a lot of hair, so I need to use a hair dryer first for about 5 minutes.  I actually look forward to doing my hair every day now because I love how it turns out using this.</li>
    <li> I have always used a blow dryer and a round brush, but have always struggled with them. I must lack the coordination or something. This hot air brush is so much easier to use because it combines those two tools into one! My hair looks like it does when I come home from the hair dresser--I&#x27;m so pleased! My hair is long and fine and after using the hot air brush is it shiny, voluminous, and bouncy! You definitely need to wait until your hair is like 80% dry, like some of the other reviewers have said, but for me that works because it gives me time to get dressed and have a cup of coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to whether this brush works better than others, but just speaking to this brush by itself, I definitely think it was worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great tool.  Beats the rotating ones that get your hair tangled.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but I&#x27;m a big fan of this brush/dryer hybrid. I can let my hair air dry and then finish it out with this, and it looks like I&#x27;ve spent ages on a full blow out. Somehow it rarely gets tangled in my very long hair and the waves last all day.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I also have the con air one and that one stinks</li>
    <li> I was traveling and didn&#x27;t want to drag brushes/hair dryer, etc.  I saw this and thought one item...good idea!  I like the functionality of the air brush.  I have very thin/fine hair.  It was easy to use and dried and shaped moist hair very well.  Only con is that the brush is pretty large for my fine/shorter hair.  It would be nice if it had a smaller brush option.</li>
    <li> I love this brush as I could never get the hang of using a brush with a dryer.  It seems to make my hair shiny and have more body.  Great purchase for sure.</li>
    <li> I have short curly/wavy hair and I could never set my hair with a hair dryer and brush (I usually end up making it more frizzy). This solved my problem! It makes my hair smooth and frizz free. And its pretty easy to use. I love it!</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  Was easy to use, worked flawlessly.</li>
    <li> This makes my morning hair drying so much easier. Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> My wife liked the first one I got her, so we&#x27;ll; that I got her a second one, to keep in her travel bag.</li>
    <li> Love this John Frieda Salon Shape 1.5 inch blow brush. I&#x27;ve never had one before so I was skeptical in selecting the right one. I looked at a lot of reviews on this one and several other ones. This one received the most positive reviews so I decided to order it. I am VERY pleased with it. The first time I used it, everyone at work noticed my hair and asked what I did differently. The brush does not get caught in your hair. It&#x27;s amazing. I would highly recommend this if your thinking about buying.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all and I really wanted to like it. My hair is considerably thick and this tool just doesn&#x27;t work for me. It takes FOREVER to blow my hair with it. I thought maybe if I dried my hair completely first and then use it for styling it would take less time. But no, the heat is just too low to do any major effects on my hair. Takes me over ten minutes on one strand of hair! Really inconvenient</li>
    <li> Best invention and makes my hair so soft</li>
    <li> So nice... Wonderful hairstyle!!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair tool!!  I use it everyday, and went out and bought another one just so I always have before they discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a keeper!!</li>
    <li> This is a terrible hair product.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything productive.  Using my hair brush with my blow dryer is a million times more effective than this thing.  Wow..not impressed.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for short hair</li>
    <li> I always had trouble  using a hair dyer with a round brush, but this solves my problem. The bristles do not &#x27;catch&#x27; my hair. It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this and I will order another one if it ever dies.  I blow dry my hair underneath before I use this, then I use this to straighten and dry the top.  It works great.  My hair is not straight and it is not quite curly, but it does a great job.  My hair is also very fine, so it is easy to dry.  If you have thick hair you will want to blow dry more than I do first, then use this to shape, but it looks so great afterward.  The top does get hot if you touch it, but for the most part you don&#x27;t need to.  This is so much better than using a round bush.</li>
    <li> Nice but needed smaller brudh</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and it&#x27;s hard to keep volume in my hair this hot tool gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Cuts my hair drying time down significantly. I don&#x27;t straight iron anymore. I don&#x27;t think this hot air brush is too good for my hair though. But neither was straight ironing.  Also, I don&#x27;t use any heat protecting products so I&#x27;m sure that would make a difference.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this air brush!  It adds volume, shine and makes my hair so soft!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is that it needs a knob on the end of the brush so that you can hold and guide it with the other hand. It could be SOOO much better if it was easier to use - especially for people who have arthritis or hand grip issues.</li>
    <li> This is my first hot air brush and I really like it. It takes me a little longer to dry my hair than it does with a blow dryer, but then I don&#x27;t have to curl or flat iron my hair. It also gives me a lot more body. I have both fine and thin hair and this really helps give my hair some OOMPH, everything else being equal. It works best if your hair is at least 50% dry. I let my hair air dry for a while and then I work in sections. It has a cool air blast that I use to set some curls.</li>
    <li> ...and I like them both!  They are just different.  I will try to describe those differences here to help people who are trying to decide between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair SpinBrush:  I have had this one for about a year now, and once I figured out the rotation directions (after only a few uses) it&#x27;s a breeze to use.  I have never had it get tangled in my hair, but I also do not use the spinning feature constantly since my hair is fine textured and that would just result in static, frizz, and probably some breakage.  I mainly use the spin feature to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; onto my hair, then let it sit for a few seconds to create shape and volume, then spin the opposite direction to release.  I usually only use the low setting, and it gets plenty warm enough to do what I need without being overly hot.  I don&#x27;t find the unit heavy or uncomfortable to use, though I only use it to finish shaping my hair when it&#x27;s mostly (90%) dry.  It&#x27;s a 2&amp;#34; brush so it is larger than my new 1.5&amp;#34; John Frieda Hot Air Brush, but it worked great on my medium-long hair.  However, I recently cut my hair back into a chin-length bob, so it&#x27;s a little too large to work on my shorter hair for right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Frieda Hot Air Brush:  I purchased this one to try with my shorter haircut and have had it about a week, so here are my initial reactions in comparison to the SpinBrush:  (1) I don&#x27;t miss the spinning because I don&#x27;t find it necessary -- the bristles of this brush &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; my hair just fine without it, and (2) it is definitely hotter, since I have only used the low setting on it as well.  Due to the heat and smaller size, this one seems to make a more defined curl at the bottom of my hair, and since I can get it closer to the roots I get more volume there as well.  In fact, the first time I tried it I made my hair HUGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, based on my experience with both products I would recommend them for fine to medium textured hair, and definitely one of the JF brushes if your hair is above your shoulders.  Those with longer, thicker hair may be able to take more advantage of the continuous spinning feature of the Conair, but I can&#x27;t really speak to that.  The Conair&#x27;s bristles are a bit softer so it needs its spinning feature to really get ahold of the hair, while the JF brush is more like a regular round brush.  They are both great products for those of us who have never bothered mastering the round brush blowout technique!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re fairly uncoordinated like me, this is amazing.  You don&#x27;t have to try to brush and dry at the same time!  I don&#x27;t dry my hair very often (I have curly hair), but when I straighten it, I use this first.  I think it helps a little with the frizz too, but I can&#x27;t say for sure...I just have a lot of frizz regardless.</li>
    <li> Frankly, I thought long and hard before you buy this product. I wanted to order the Babyliss, but after reading the great reviews and the price a little surprised, I agreed to the purchase. And it was a big mistake! The quality of the bristles is terrible, it is very soft, does not hold the shape and certainly not wind the hair. A couple of days after use, bristles at all spread across the drum and began to turn off after 5 minutes of work! I do not know where such good reviews, I think the quality is very low and do not recommend to buy it.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and sometimes frizzy.  This hot air brush helps eliminate that problem.  Works great.</li>
    <li> This brush hairdryer is the best invention ever for straightening hair. Its so easy to use &amp; has different heat settings. If you use a round brush and a blowdryer to dry your hair - then you&#x27;ll definitely love this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I got this but knew when i purchased that i should have gotten a rotating one. This one made my hair more frizzy. I didn&#x27;t care for it and ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> Maybe my hair is too short, but the bristles on the brush are very flexible and would not hold my hair.  I think I&#x27;ll keep it because I&#x27;m growing my hair a bit longer.  I&#x27;ll see.  I would send it back, but it would be a problem as there was no paperwork included with the product (no invoice, return address label, etc.)</li>
    <li> This hot air brush produces wonderfully loose curls and is great at smoothing your hair while drying it. A couple of suggestions though, the base is quite large making it hard to get my hand around easily and I am not a petite person. Also, it would be nice to have a tip on the end to help hold while curling-a bit awkward to style with one hand. I have been using this for over a month and am getting used to the size and used to not using a second hand to help hold the brush (it gets really, really hot!). Overall, I really like the curls and would recommend this hot air brush for loose, relaxed curls.</li>
    <li> I really like it.  It curls well.  I usually dry my hair about 80% before using it.  I would like to try the rotating curling iron too.</li>
    <li> The only problem I found was the circumference is a little bigger than I expected. It&#x27;s best for medium and long hair. Otherwise it&#x27;s works great.</li>
    <li> I love it! Does not burn your hair. Has a cool button on it! Sets curl! Bought one for my friend and my sister. K</li>
    <li> I have really thick, curly hair, and generally need high power dryer to obtain fast results. This dryer is very easy to use and is sufficiently ergonomic. It is also relatively silent. But the air flow is not strong enough, so it takes a long time to dry my hair. But again, I have lots of it. So if you have hair that is not too curly or thick, it&#x27;s probably a really good tool. I will give it to my mother, who has wavy, fine hair.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome.  It dries my hair quickly, and gives amazing lift and volume, which isn&#x27;t easy to get with my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it takes the frizz out of my hair. My hair feels smooth and seems shinier. Never gets caught or tangled. Must say even on the low heat the tip gets too warm to touch after a while. I just put the cool air on for a minute and it is fine.</li>
    <li> This item does not have a powerful fan for drying a hair. It takes significant amount of time for drying.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have very fine hair, so it&#x27;s great for giving my hair volume .</li>
    <li> Where was this all my life? I am rarely impressed by hair tools as most of them never truly meet my needs. I have super thick, course hair that takes forever to straighten. I have tried every tool out there. As soon as something comes out, I buy it in hope it will solve my hair issues. From the best barrel brushes, the Chi, Instyler, Curling Irons; if it was advertised to curl hair, chances are I have tried it.&lt;br /&gt;This Hot Brush is by far my favorite! It cut my hair straightening time in half. No more taking breaks because my hand hurts, no more trying to get the right angle on my hair dryer, no more scorching my ends and burning my scalp! In only 2 passes, a big section of my hair is smooth and straight. The shape of the hair stays in place whichever way you turn the Hot Brush. I tried using it with 80% of my hair dried as instructed on some videos I watched but I think I prefer it with my hair just towel dried. It worked better the wetter my hair was. It is also really light and the 1.5&amp;#34; barrel is the perfect size for most hair types. I haven&#x27;t tried the cool or low heat settings as my hair requires a lot of heat due to its thickness. The hot setting works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something that combines the troublesome barrel brush and hair dryer, this is it and then some!</li>
    <li> The hot air brush is OK -- but I have to work hard to get my hair to wrap around it and my wrists aren&#x27;t that strong.  I now use a rotating brush that resolves that problem.  If my hair were short the Frieda brush probably would have worked well, but it is a little past chin length.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Does not tangle.  I use my regular hair dryer until 80% dry, then this for finishing.  I wish I had gotten the 1&amp;#34; as my hair is very fine, thin, and shoulder length, and the 1 1/2&amp;#34; straightens it out too much.</li>
    <li> I was looking for  a product to help me get the blown out salon look. this product is perfect!. it gave me hair volume and straightened it perfectly. it also looked like i just left he hair salon. If you are looking a product to help you get that finished and polished look this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> This brush has now power and leaves my hair frizzy rather than smooth after a blowdry. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Finally I found the perfect roller brush. I had a con air  for years and it died, this one is much better.  It has perfect bristles that grab the hair for awesome control. I bought  the Spin Brush  and didn&#x27;t like it .The bristles are weak and it was awkward to hold. This fits in my had and does the job quickly and effortlessly .... It is a great buy too.  I&#x27;ll buy another encase they become had to find later. I&#x27;ll take this on vacation for quick styling &amp; smoothing  for those days on the water.</li>
    <li> Easy to use but you have to keep your fingers away from the toggle switch or you&lt;br /&gt;will keep pushing it to the cold setting. Small issue for how easy it is to make your&lt;br /&gt;hair look good without a hot iron or silly curlers.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer dries very quickly and is easy to use to style your hair. It is light weight and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this hairbrush dryer.  It gives me high volume and shine, and the same results my stylist achieves with her round brush blow drys</li>
    <li> I got this air brush because I was never able to emulate the blow dry look my stylist got with a round brush. This does this trick. I first use a regular hairdryer to dry my hair to the point of barely being damp. I then use this airbrush to finish the style. I have abundant but fine, slick hair that&#x27;s cut in a short bob. The bristles are flexible enough that I can continuously roll the brush in my hair without it getting tangled. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am one of the cosmetically challenged. You might call me a tomboy or a jeans and t-shirt kinda gal. I don&#x27;t know how to apply makeup other than some basic blush and mascara. But now, thanks to this handy dandy hot air brush, I am proud to say that I know how to style my hair! It&#x27;s so easy. I used it for the second time today and I think it took me a few minutes. I have a bobish cut, just below my chin, and the 1.5 inch brush works great, even with some shorter layers in the back. I read the reviews that said to get the hair 80% dry before use, and I&#x27;d change that to 95% dry. I tried it at about 80% and it took too long. Today I got my hair about 95% dry before using the hot air brush and it took a few minutes. Love it.</li>
    <li> This thing is just amazing. I like to blow dry my hair semi straight with rounded ends and this makes it so easy to do. I wont have to use both brush and dryer to do that ever again. I just love it. The cord is pretty long too.</li>
    <li> I felt this hot air brush was bulky and weak. Doesn&#x27;t dry wet hair easily. For the size I expected much more power.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be swayed away by the haters telling you this doesn&#x27;t dry thick hair.  It isn&#x27;t intended to dry thick hair , unless you want to stand there all day.  Use a regular drier until your hair is damp and the use this easy to use tool to style.  I&#x27;ve used such tools for 20+ years and this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised does take awhile to get going wish it would get a little hotter put for the price I can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work that great for my long, fine hair. Will try again now that I&#x27;ve cut it shorter and update as necessary.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It&#x27;s so wonderful to not need to juggle a hair dryer and a round brush while trying to dry and style my hair.  It smoothes my course gray (colored) hair while still keeping body in the style.  The only thing I would change is the power switch.  It slides from Off to Low, to High, and then to the Cool shot.  If you are using the styler on low then it&#x27;s inefficient to have to slide past High to use the Cool  option.  It would be better if it was it&#x27;s own separate button.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I Love This!  :o)</li>
    <li> The air gets hot and the surface under the bristles does, too. It works okay. I think it would work better if the bristles were more like my hair brush instead of plastic.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I just to use the blow dryer and round brush but no with beauty I get the job done much faster, defiantly a must have.</li>
    <li> I like this hot air brush for my medium length hair.  If your hair is very short the large brush diameter might not work well.  I also agree with previous reviews that it&#x27;s not much of a hair dryer, more useful for damp hair as a styler.  I like it, it creates a smooth shiny look but don&#x27;t expect a powerful hairdryer.</li>
    <li> This hot air brush works great!!  Makes styling your hair easier.  My hair seems softer and has more shine.  I would recommend buying John Frieda Hot Air Brush.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this Hot Air Brush. It&#x27;s styles my hair quickly and easily. I have long medium thick hair with long layers ..I add styling spray for volume, then dry my hair with my blow dryer not completely and then use it to style my hair! Quick and easy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hot air brush!  You can use it on dry hair!  So easy, I walk out the door with a salon look, and it only takes a few minutes!  My hair is thin and it puffs it right up!  Definitely recommend this one!  Buy one now!</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Amazon and absolutely love it! My hair is frizzy and curly - usually I have to blow dry my hair with a vent brush and then use a 1\\&quot; curling iron to smooth my hair. This product cuts out the 2 step process for me - I only need to use this to achieve the frizz free look. Granted, I used a keratin treatment on my hair 2 months ago, but this product is absolutely worth the money. I let my hair dry at least 50% and then use this for a fabulous look - lots of compliments. It&#x27;s great for touching up too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 22 year old daughter for Christmas.  She absolutely loves it.  She uses it almost every day, and had mentioned how great it is to me several times.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving the John Frieda Hot Air Brush a 4 only because there is nothing at the end to hold while styling. Other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> Returned item.  It was too large for me/</li>
    <li> I had ordered this hot air brush for my wife and she likes it. The product is build nicely and there is a plastic and nylon brush that helps catch hairs when you have to roll them. The heat is OK but you have thick hair, it might not be sufficient and you may need a 750 watt product. Overall satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Brush was easier to use than I thought it would be.  Read the instructions, followed them and it wasn&#x27;t complicated at all.  My hair was dried, curled and set to go  in no time.  I really was surprised to see how shiny and healthy my hair looked after using this brush.  I studied appliances and reviews and saved hair &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; to my wish list for way too long and I finally decided to try this one.  Glad I did. :)</li>
    <li> My wife just love it. She used it and was quite impressed. Works really well and a must buy product.</li>
    <li> This is the best round brush dryer I have ever used! My friend recommended this one to me and I love it!! My hair actually looks like my hair stylist did it! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Alright so it is not meant for long thick hair like mine. It does the job if you have at least an hour and a half to spend. Not meant to be used on straight out of the shower hair because it&#x27;s just not powerful enough. The little cage at the very bottom of the barrel becomes lose which I feel like changes the already slow operation of the device.</li>
    <li> I love it.  You can use it if your hair is soaking wet or dry to give it softness &amp; shine.  Easy to use even with my short hair.  It&#x27;s been a great help during my awkward growing out stage.  I bet it will be amazing once my hair is longer.</li>
    <li> I really thought I was going to like this product however I didn&#x27;t find that it blows out enough  hot air. It would take me way to long to blow out my hair with this only. I was disappointed</li>
    <li> This would be good if you have thinner hair.  My hair is thick and this didn&#x27;t smooth my hair at all and I felt it dried my hair out.  I got better results with my round brush.</li>
    <li> I have bought this hot air brush twice and both have burned out after only a few months of use.  I never use it on wet hair, only damp hair for styling, not drying.  Still it does not last!  After a few months of use it will overheat and burn out. I have wasted my money on this twice!!</li>
    <li> I have own this now for a month, found this on a  YouTube clip. I have never seen it in any store I have shopped, just love it !! am going to give one to my daughter this Christmas.  I was using a Wal-Mart type hot brush that I was always cussing(grab fine hairs and pull them, also brush head would slip when it got hot ).  I&#x27;m 57 , I have thick natural curly hair , color treated, shoulder length , wash my hair at least every two days, I live in a dry climate. this brush is easy to use, works fast. I plan on purchasing another just for travel.  worth every penny, hope this helps your decision to buy.</li>
    <li> This really works! My hair can be hard to style due to multiple cowlicks, and using this has made my mornings great! I recommend this.</li>
    <li> At least once a week this seems to stop working and even resetting it doesn&#x27;t always get it working right away.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer.  My hair turned out nice.&lt;br /&gt;One problem, I have very thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;The photo on top of the page shows little spikes on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;If you look further down, the photo is different; it has no spikes and looks like a regular hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I got the REGULAR ONE!&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t get the brush to reach my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;I had to section my hair. I didn&#x27;t like that much!&lt;br /&gt;Took forever!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and  does a very good job.</li>
    <li> Smooths my hair out, can&#x27;t curl my hair or keep the curls that are there, adds no volume and my hair is flat within minutes.</li>
    <li> Garbage, barely works, I&#x27;ve been using these for years and this one is garbage. Sadly, I missed the return window as I wanted to try it out a couple times to ensure it really was the product and it is. Don&#x27;t buy this one, buy the Conair version, it&#x27;s much better!</li>
    <li> I scoured videos online for feedback and usage tips on different air brushes. I picked this one because the barrel was sufficient, and the videos I found showed exactly what I was looking for in a hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on dirty, greasy hair as well as clean hair. I have fine, but thick hair with natural waves and highlights that go bananas in humidity. My bangs have a cowlick. This hot air brush eliminated my bang cowlick, and does not feel like it would do long term damage to my fine hair. When I style my hair with it, some of the styling lasts even through the next day and I don&#x27;t use a lot of product on my hair. Not to say everyone will have the same results, but I have found this item works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is lightweight, and has a cool and hot air selection. The 1.5 inch barrel works well for me with my hair at about shoulder length. I was trying to figure out between this one and the self-turning air brush, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one as I have more control with how my hair is styled. Plus, less moving parts in my mind means less things to break and a lighter product.</li>
    <li> Very poor product. I have medium thick soft and wavy hair. Purchased this after reading all the raving reviews, hopign to style well using this electronic brush. I had horrible results...my hair turned very very rough just with one use ( I use good base products before using hot iron/curlers). Results were rough to touch hair, burnt hair texture that took me a long time to correct- I do NOT recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Works well for frizzy hair and easier than using separate brush and blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I was very optimistic that I could use the Hot Air Brush instead of a dryer/brush combo but honestly not able to use as a replacement.  My hair is medium length and stick straight so maybe that combination is just not ideal for the brush.  Am keeping it because I threw the box away, but don&#x27;t expect that I&#x27;ll be using much.  Again, maybe it&#x27;s my hair or maybe it&#x27;s just me as others have had lots of positive things to say about the brush.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  Bristles are firm enough to hold hair in place without  slipping off.  It does not tangle hair.  Easy to work with but I do half dry my hair with hair dryer first, then switch to this to complete the drying and final styling into place.</li>
    <li> I have very course and frizzy hair and live at the seashore.  This hot air brush tames and smoothes my hair every time.  I use it on partially dry to dry hair after shampooing and between shampoos.  Since I travel quite a bit, I always pack it.  It is much lighter than my high-powered hair dryer and does a great job.  This is a very practical, low cost hair solution for me.  When I think about all the money I&#x27;ve spent over the years on lotions, gels, mousses, potions and hair treatments, this was a huge bargain.</li>
    <li> Oh, Boy, I received my brush in 24 hours and I just love it. It is the best tool ever. I have long hair and I&#x27;ve been trying so many brushes before, some of them I couldn&#x27;t get out of my hair because they were stack, some were just really wasting of money. Thank you for this one it&#x27;s just right one for right price.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool! I use it as a finishing tool. I dry my hair 90% then use it. I have fine blonde hair. It really helps with volume too. I would defiantly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a very easy dryer and styler for my fine,  thin hair .  It is the best drying and styling product that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I would highly recommend this for anyone without thick hair.  Makes drying and styling time much shorter.</li>
    <li> i recieved this product in the mail promptly and in good condition. I decided to try thie john frieda hot air brush out and after shampooing i used it without any product. Here is what i like about the product. it heats up easy making it fast at drying your hair. if you roll the brush through your hair twords the middle re roll it the drying time is quicker. it straightens and dries your hair ading body and for me that is a pluce. i have thick hair and it is curly wavy so i have to work harder to do it right. cons it takes longer than i thought to dry hair but that is a small con. i like this tool and hope it last and works well for a long time to come. happy styling!!!!</li>
    <li> They do works great and love the way that they look in the oven. Makes my oven spark with the color..</li>
    <li> My first purchase was one of those rotating brushes and I returned it because it did not work on my hair. I decided to try this model by John Freida and I am so pleased with how well it worked. I just placed an order for another one in case they quit making this model. I am a very happy customer with this product.  I have an angled bob style that comes to top of my shoulders and my hair is fairly thick and can get quite frizzy right after blow drying.  I therefore have to flat iron it straight. With this hot air brush I won&#x27;t need to use a flat iron.  That will be good for my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the great reviews about it. I hate drying my hair. I have long hair past my shoulders and although it is thin, it really holds water. I was hoping this would reduce drying time. I was skeptical when I first opened the box. It is a lot larger than I expected and a little clumsy to hold. It didn&#x27;t reduce my drying time by a lot but it did dry and style in the time it usually takes just to dry. My hair came out soft and bouncy similar to the effect when I use hot rollers but this was instant! I would definitely recommend it. The only downfalls I found were that it is a little clumsy (but I think this will lessen as I get used to using it) and I wish it has more of a tip on the end as I grab it out of habit from using a curling iron to stabilize it when rolling. Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer curler I hv ever bought and I love it it curls your hair with nice loose curls in the ends it heats wonderfully easy clean filter on bottom and makes your hair shinny and smooth!! Sry so quickly written but it&#x27;s a fantastic but you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
    <li> Love this air brush!!!  It was a little pricey in comparison to the other air brushes I have purchased but it is wonderful! Was pleased that it does not get too hot and turn off as several of the other brands have done.</li>
    <li> I have thin,wavy,frizzy hair and I use multiple hair products to control both the wave and the frizziness...to no avail...until I started using this hot air brush. It delivers what it promised... shorter time of styling, less frizziness, more shine and a bounce to your hair that actually lasts the next day. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the button. I&#x27;ll have to agree with the other customers, J. Frieda company could have done a better job with that.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well on my fine hair.  I still have to use a brush and hair dryer to get the results I want.</li>
    <li> produces great soft curls.  works best on nearly dry hair.  only complaint is the control switch is tough to use.  the settings are so tight.  Everything else about it is great!!</li>
    <li> It makes my curly almost frizzy hair sleek and shiny without the obnoxious effort of regular blow drying then having to flat iron after. This is a great one and done deal. I don&#x27;t use it everyday but I can see how someone could use it everyday since it&#x27;s very easy. The brush part doesn&#x27;t rotate but it allows for a lot easier hair drying than a round brush and blow dryer separate.</li>
    <li> The John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush style/dries my hair in half the time that it took me to dry with a drier and brush.  AND I love the way it styles it my hair.  The barrel size is a nice size (1.5 inch) but for parts of my medium length hair (like in the front around my face) I might have liked a barrel just a little smaller.  The plastic tip does get really warm, almost too hot to the touch.  To calm it down a little, I blast the cool setting for a minute (I use this during styling to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my style) and it cools down enough.  But I have found that I really don&#x27;t need to handle the unit with more than one hand now that I have the hang of it.  It is a bit quieter than my Chi hairdryer, so that is nice.  In fact, I like it so much, I haven&#x27;t used my regular hair dryer since I received this one.  Great Buy!</li>
    <li> Found this really good to style my thick curly hair. Not good for drying thick hair but might work if your hair is thin</li>
    <li> i loved this product. its basically a slightly lower-powered hair dryer and round brush combo. my hair is mostly fine &amp; a bit frizzy/thick in some areas &amp; medium length. It takes me about 25 min to dry my hair but my arms arent aching afterward. And I dont have to twist around in weird positions to hold a brush &amp; dryer separately. I love the ease &amp; convenience and its lightweight. I doesnt necessarily give better volume than dryer/brush. Like the cool setting. Great product for the price &amp; ease of use.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this tool makes my hair look. It&#x27;s very soft and shiny, unlike when I use my blow dryer and brush. But it took forever! I always use my blow dryer and brush to straighten my hair and it gets my hair straight and it does it fast, but then it always looks dry. When I used the hot air brush to try to straighten my hair, it didn&#x27;t turn out straight. I have a loose spiral wave to my hair and the brush dried my hair too slow so it just made it wavy before the heat could style it straight. My hair still looked great though, so I&#x27;m happy with this product, (besides the time it took.)&lt;br /&gt;The day after I used it to straighten my hair, I tried curling my hair with it. It worked so much better! That probably has something to do with the texture of my hair, but it was much quicker and easier than my blow dryer and brush. I didn&#x27;t use any hairspray, I put the curls up in a messy bun in the evening, I slept on them, and my hairstyle was still completely intact the next day.&lt;br /&gt;If this would have worked just as well for straightening my hair as it did for curling my hair it would have gotten 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This hot air brush takes a LONG time to get hot! It blows cool air for a long time and then finally warms up. Works well once hot.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair with long layers (shortest layers are just below my ears). I use this on damp hair and with Blow Pro products (root lifter, volumizing mousse, and heat primer) and it gives me a light, salon ready look. It leaves my hair feeling so soft and shiny! It is so much easier for me to use this hot air brush than using a comb and blow drier. Just an FYI it does have a switch to blow cool air. Anyway, the only reason I give this four stars is because my hair gets caught in this sometimes and and manages to pull a few hairs out-ouch! Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair...but lots of it. I had a con air hot air brush for a a few years that I liked, so when it finally died on me, I wanted another (preferably even better) one. This brush does make my hair very shiny, adds some volume, and overall does a great job. I like the swivel cord which I didn&#x27;t think would matter, but it is nice to have. It is not very powerful. Like, at all. So unless I have a lot of time in the morning to get ready (never), I either have to run out the door with wet/damp hair or take time to blow dry my hair first. The lack of power, for me, defeats the purpose of having a brush that is supposed to dry and style.  I&#x27;ve tried different ways to use it in the morning, but even with doing EVERYTHING first and doing my hair at the very last minute, I can&#x27;t get my hair dry enough to walk out the door with dry hair only using the brush (I&#x27;m up at 5 and out the door by 5:40 so for people who don&#x27;t spend their morning rushing/are better at planning their morning than me it might be great). On the weekends I&#x27;ve managed to use only this to style my hair, and it does come out light and shiny and bouncy. The slider button control is a bit annoying too, I have to pay attention to get it to the right setting. Very minor, but a small annoyance to myself at 5am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the brush, I just wish it had more drying power and changed up the slider control a bit. Will probably keep searching for a better time saving tool that will dry and style my hair in one.</li>
    <li> I really liked it, and it did what I wanted it to do.  I had a broken shoulder, and now have problems with curling brushes and hair dryers, but this is all it takes.</li>
    <li> This would be perfect if the brush would rotate and if the brush was smaller. Would not recommend for short hair</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this hot air brush, which I bought it for her as a birthday present........ She said that it really works great with her hair.</li>
    <li> The best hot air brush I have ever used! Does not tangle the hair. Gives a smooth&lt;br /&gt;great finised look. So happy with this brush, purchased one for my Daughter, she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased a sencond one for back up, I do not want to be without it , ever!</li>
    <li> This hot air brush is amazing. I use a blow dryer for a few minutes until my hair is just damp, then I use the hot air brush to style. Friends have asked me if I just had my hair done at a salon. . . it comes out that good. My total drying/styling time has been cut in half and my hair comes out better than ever. This is a MUST have air brush for me.</li>
    <li> If anyone could see my hair before I use the John Frieda Hot Air Brush and after, they wouldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  I am a 40 yr old caucasian female with extremely curly hair.  I have had my hair close-cropped for years because the curls are unmanageable but decided to try letting it grow out. Couldn&#x27;t use a flat-iron because my hair is so thick (and I&#x27;m not very coordinated).  Anyway, I thought I would try this because of the great reviews and I have not been disappointed.  It makes my hair go from fuzz to soft and smooth.  Some reviewers have mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t get very hot, but I would disagree. Any hotter and my hair would be fried. I use thermal serum to protect my hair from the heat.  It isn&#x27;t meant to be a blow dryer so it won&#x27;t work well if your hair is very wet, but on damp hair it&#x27;s great.  I can smooth my hair out with this and then use the flat iron. So many people have asked what I&#x27;m doing different to my hair! I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> The product is damage to the second use, I do not buy any other product of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;greetings.&lt;br /&gt;Mario Di Cicco</li>
    <li> I hate that I spent this much on it. I was so excited when I received it that I tore the box. After I used it I tried to act happy and asked my husband how he liked my hair. He said exactly what I thought, &amp;#34;it looks the same&amp;#34;. I do have nice hair (genes) but expected this to make it even better. Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Med length hair/shoulder&lt;br /&gt;Straight&lt;br /&gt;Med thick</li>
    <li> I am one of those women who has never been able to style my hair very well.  I usually spend an hour working over my medium length, fine, frizzy bob.  If it comes out cute, it&#x27;s pure luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the John Frieda Hot Air Brush.  Simply amazing.  I have used the brush on my freshly shampooed hair three times so far, and each time my hair has blended into a silky, swingy natural looking style.  I am getting compliments on my hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another huge bonus is that it only takes about 20 minutes from start to finish to shampoo and style my hair.  I haven&#x27;t had to use flat irons, curling irons etc., which means less heat damage to my hair.  Also, I&#x27;ve been able to easily restyle the next day without washing, simply by putting the brush on low with warm air, and then finishing on the cool cycle.  I love this brush!!!  Even my bangs look great...always the hardest part of my hair to style.  They just fall into place.  You can easily change your look as you blow dry, because you have so much control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush...especially to those who aren&#x27;t gifted with great hair or good styling skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only criticism is that it is a little difficult to switch from one cycle to another with the button.  The different settings almost blend together.  Would have preferred a better design there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I am so delighted with this brush that I&#x27;m thinking of ordering a second one for back-up, in case this one gets broken or JF stops making it.</li>
    <li> Very good, like it. It is very easy to use. It is very powerful.  I can now dry and style my hair with just one hand.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy, course hair, which can be difficult to style, but this product has made that task super easy. It has definitely replaced my blow dryer &amp; round brush, which in my hands were a bit unwieldy. I partially air-dry my hair, then style with the hot air brush. The results are awesome. As I don&#x27;t have to shampoo daily, I can smooth out the &#x27;bed hair&#x27; in minutes, something that was difficult with other hot air brushes I&#x27;ve used. I highly recommend this product to anyone with medium to long hair.</li>
    <li> I had a problem getting my hair smooth&lt;br /&gt;&amp; frizz free. This product worked for me. It cut my drying time by half.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s really easy to use.  Light, effective even on the cool setting, much quieter than my basic dryer.  I&#x27;m grateful to the Amazon reviews which encouraged me to buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this a bit ago, but still love it. Very easy to use. I cannot use a blow dryer and hair brush to style my hair...this is so great.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t stay on..Maybe short in cord....</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Helps to get rid of bed head in the morning. Works great! Gives me a nice sleek look.</li>
    <li> Wish I had discovered this earlier.</li>
    <li> I think this is the first time I have taken the time to write a review for a product on amazon but this product is really worth it. I love this product.  Makes drying hair so easy I do get my hair about 70 -80 percent dry before I use it and do small sections at a time.  It is very light and love that it has three heat settings.  Doing my hair with a blow dryer and brush took alot of coordination for  me and with this product my hair comes out pretty well and it is lighter than my hairdryer.  I never could do the back of my hair with brush and blow dryer but can with this air brush.  I actually look forward to drying my hair which I didn&#x27;t before.  I now have an exra hand in I need to hold the air brush in place or guide it.  I also knew if I wasn&#x27;t happy with it amazon would take it back.  If you are consider buying this do I don&#x27;t think you will be sorry.  I wanted to add this account was set up by my son years ago.  He use to do alot of my computer work. like I said first time I have actually reviewed a product</li>
    <li> I recently chopped my loong hair to a just above the shoulder Bob and needed a new tool to quickly dry my hair and style it. I have tried several of the hot air brushes over the years and this one is the winner. When I first got the package I opened it and immediately plugged it and turned it on to make sure it worked and see how hot it got. I will admit at that moment I was unimpressed. It is super light weight which I did like. So then I washed my hair and let it air dry for a bit and then began to use my new beauty tool. I read several reviews that said it works best on almost dry hair. Which is true... But I have faith that if I wanted to spend the extra time it would work just as great on wet/damp hair. I didn&#x27;t wanna spend the time today so I dried my hair a bit with my regular dryer. Once I started to use the hot air brush I was amazed!! No hair pulling! Hot enough to style! Volume volume volume !!! And I wasn&#x27;t one to think I had frizzy hair but I guess I did . I look like I walked out the salon and feel like a million bucks... And I only spend about $30. I. Love it... Buy it...u won&#x27;t regret it . When this thing dies on me a lil piece of my heart will break as well.</li>
    <li> this is a great tool - smooths out my flyaway hairs and gives a nice slight curl to my ends. hair doesnt get stuck but also doesnt slip out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the results of using this hot air brush to style my hair. It is easy to use and leaves my hair looking like I&#x27;ve just left the hair salon. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned. It styles my hair as it dries and then I don&#x27;t have to do a single thing to it. I received compliments on my hair just the other day, and girls were guessing that I used hot rollers and a large curling iron. They were surprised when I told them I use this dryer for 10 minutes each morning and no other styling tools are needed. My hair is medium length with long layers and long bangs. It has a lot of natural curl to it and can get frizzy if left unstyled. With this hot air brush, I let my hair air dry for about 1/2 hour each day before styling. This Hot Air Brush is gentle, and not overly hot so if I started with very wet hair, it would take me a long time to get it dry with this tool. I have it 4 stars instead of 5 for that reason... I wish it had just a bit more power and heat.  But that being said, other styling tools have burnt and damaged my hair and this one does not so I guess that&#x27;s the advantage to it&#x27;s gentleness.  I will buy this again as needed, and I just purchased one for my sister to try.</li>
    <li> I dry my hair to moist and then use this brush. It doesn&#x27;t look like a professional job, but it is as close as I have ever come!!</li>
    <li> John Frieda is very nice, removes the friz, easy use, I hope be durable...&lt;br /&gt;Tks :)</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing hair and curling ends. I blow my hair out until completely dry with my regular blow dryer, then use this one to smooth and curl under slightly. This would not be good as a blow dryer. I suppose you COULD dry your hair with it, but I think it would definitely take longer than a conventional blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because I didn&#x27;t buy it with the intention of actually drying my hair with it. I use it as a styling tool, and it is great for that. I have naturally curly hair that I dry straight. This works great for smoothing and straightening in between, if the humidity is starting to cause unwanted frizz or waves.</li>
    <li> On time delivery. White LOVES it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very good with \\&quot;new\\&quot; hair tools - I just don&#x27;t have the patience to learn. But this is one amazing little gadget! I got the hang of it easily and was recommending it after just one use.      I have almost-chin-length hair that I&#x27;m growing out. So, naturally is has no style right now. But with this brush, I&#x27;m able to put enough bounce and softness into it that it looks really presentable. I&#x27;ve tried a flat iron, but never mastered it. My hair always ended up looking just that - flat.  A hot roller or two will help, but usually makes my hair too curly.  My hair is fine textured, but I have a lot of it. So...thick, fine hair if that makes sense. Getting it smooth and shiny is not easy.    I know some reviewers like the fact that the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button stays on...it&#x27;s not a button you hold down with your thumb or finger, like most of the hair dryers with a \\&quot;cool shot.\\&quot;  But I have to say, I did NOT like this one feature. Since the cooling is supposed to just set the wave or curl, it&#x27;s kind of cumbersome to have to find the switch, and change the setting over and over, on each section of hair. But not a deal-breaker. For me, it will just take some practice.    I opened this carefully, prepared to send it back if I hated it. Happy to report that it&#x27;s staying in my bathroom!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not great at doing my hair. This makes styling a little easier, since you&#x27;re not having to do the two-handed round brush/hair dryer deal. I have really thick hair, though, so I most of the time need to blow dry it about 75% and then use this tool to finish the style.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s silly because it has so little power. Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you&#x27;re practically bald!</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing it in a magazine. Used it this morning and it cut the time it takes to do my hair in half! This is so easy to use, I don&#x27;t know what to do with my other hand now after having to use a brush and the blow dryer for so many months. I have medium thick hair so I blow dryed it 60% before using the brush. Super quiet too which is a plus. The cord is long enough to get the back of your head as well. Love how smooth it leaves my hair too. [[ASIN:B0056GDG90 John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush]]</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this product!  I always had difficulty coordinating a hairdryer and a round brush.  This is so easy to use and my hair doesnt get stuck in the brush either!</li>
    <li> I really like this hot hair brush. My fine hair gets really smooth and straight. Also not damaging to my hair.</li>
    <li> Low heat and blower action. Not as expected</li>
    <li> Just wish the handkle was a bit thinner to hold it better , other than that it is perfect for the job</li>
    <li> I have difficulty holding a hair dryer and round brush to dry my hair.  This product does it for me.  Most importantly, my hair does NOT get tangled in the brush.  Extremely quick way to get my hair looking its best in the morning.  Note the brush DOES NOT REVOLVE (which is good) ...the heat from the unit dries the hair.  Superb!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it!  It straightens her hair more easily and frees up one hand for styling.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for awhile.  My hair is fine, but according to hair stylists, I have a ton of it....which means it takes forever to dry.  Reading some of the other reviews, I wondered if 500 watts would be enough...It is MORE than enough.  My hair tends to be frizzy.  This product took care of that.  My hair looks like I just came from the stylist.  I have tried straighteners, round barrel curling irons.....nothing seemed to work right.  It is very difficult to use the round brush and hairdryer on your own hair.  It did not tangle at all.  I absolutely love it.  I looked around at local stores online, and no one carries it in the store, you have to have it shipped to store and pick it up.  I ordered this product one day and it was at my house the very next day.....awesome.</li>
    <li> Nice product, works really well with wavey and curly hair. I was hellA fine when my hair was did.  However, it is a little noisy. But overall it&#x27;s legit. ;)</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked this good - full and flowing.&lt;br /&gt;I would like the brush to come in two sizes - this size and one smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the eaze of use is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, I always hated blow drying my hair but this is much faster for me and I&#x27;m able to give myself nice waves. I have very curly hair so it&#x27;s usually either very curly or very straight so I love this :)</li>
    <li> I have had several blow dryer brushes over the years... This one is my favorite!!! it does a really nice job on both long and short hair... LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know it would blow hot air, thought it was going to be like a curling brush and style your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, well priced, shipped quickly. Wish Frieda also made a 3/4&amp;#34; or 1&amp;#34; version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting GREAT results with this!&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft enough to not tear &amp; break my hair, and yet I have no trouble with how well they grip and go through my hair. I&#x27;ve also noticed my hair dries faster with this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I find the air flow to be just right.  I dry my hair from towel dried wet, and this dries it nicely and with a gentled more concentrated flow so as to not cause all those little hairs to stand up and look awful. The drying power is all there though.&lt;br /&gt; I like having 2 heat choices as well as a cool flow.&lt;br /&gt;The barrell is just the right size for my almost to shoulders bob, but I have some layering on top, and this gives me just enough lift &amp; volume too. My hair is frizz-less &amp; smooth &amp; shiney with curl at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers complained of the tip being too hot. I am able to touch it with 2 fingertips for guidance w/out a prob, just as I did with a previous unit I had. Didnt bother me.&lt;br /&gt;What would have bothered me would have been if the cord constantly tangled... It doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Really happy with this brush dryer...and have received compliments on my hair since using it. Doesnt get any better than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE...unfortunately I had to return this dryer after a bit due to a build up of static electricity in my hair that worsened with each use. Dont know why. Became impossible to style hair.  Dropping a star as a result. Too bad, because I liked this one otherwise.</li>
    <li> My hair is super fine but thick and frizzes up. I use this after using a regular dryer to get my hair about 90% dry. I brush through a small section til I get to about 3 inches from the bottom and start to curl the hair up until I get to the end and roll it up half way up my head. I&#x27;ll hold it there for about 15-30 seconds then switch to the cold setting for another 10-15 seconds and then move on to another section. I end up with very smooth hair and very flattering big curl at the end. It does take some time to get the heat to really penetrate but my hair is very difficult with holding curl do this might not be an issue for everyone. Great tool!</li>
    <li> The brush works well on fine hair, but next time I will order differently, with one that has a rotating brush &amp; There are 3 settings on one switch making transitions to different settings awkward.  The single switch includes a low heat, high heat, &amp; the cooling setting. If there was a separate cooling button ( similar to a hair dryer)nstyling would be easier and quicker.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush the only reason I gave it four stars is because the handle is so big around. I would like it better a bit more slimmer. I have smaller hands maybe. And the button to turn it on and off is really stiff and hard to turn on sometimes. Other than that I really am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Brilliant brush on this dryer, so easy to use, but beware, as reported by other reviewers, mine blew up on the second day, and I mean  blew....... It singed my hair. Fair play though, they offered me an instant refund .but I&#x27;m still worried as to why this is happening, I live in the UK, so maybe the voltage is not compatable or something, but it needs looking into. Shame, it was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Hate to be one of the very few who doesn&#x27;t love this tool. 500 watt power doesn&#x27;t really lock in a style for me. Looks ok as soon as I&#x27;m done styling but within minutes my hair is frizzy and no longer smooth at all, even after hairspray. I recently got butchered at the salon with many short, unmanageable layers so take that into consideration. I really wanted this to work but I think a more powerful wattage is what&#x27;s needed for my unruly hair.</li>
    <li> Good for touch ups between shampoos. Creates nice curls. I have a bob and I use it to fluff up my bed head!</li>
    <li> Hurts your hair, causes breakage</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I expected but still saves time when I just have time for a quick touch-up.</li>
    <li> Has lived up to my expectations. The amount of heat is perfect and it dries pretty well. It seems to smooth the hair well. Still can&#x27;t duplicate what my hair dresser can do but it&#x27;s as close as I&#x27;ll get!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for anyone who needs one-handed hairdrying &amp; styling abilities. I&#x27;ve had it for months and still use it. Just make sure your hair is fairly dry; not for soaking wet hair.</li>
    <li> I love how easy this brush is to handle! I can style my hair with it very quickly which is a big plus. Great product if you are looking to achieve volume without all the work of handling a big round brush and a blow dryer at the same time. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who wants to cut their styling time in half........really!</li>
    <li> It gets too hot with the time and the brush does not turn it self. But it works ok. Cheers</li>
    <li> It is a large barrel. 1.5 inch sounds small be it is large for medium length hair. It is not any easier to use than a hair dryer &amp; brush, and I often find myself either doing 90% of drying with the hair dryer and brush, or 100%. I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I have never got the hang of the round brush and the hair dryer and don&#x27;t have the patience for it either.  I have only used this tool once so far, but my hair looks great.  &amp;#34;Rough&amp;#34; dry it with a regular hair dryer and then use this styling tool to finish up. The other rave reviewers are right..  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> At first I found it quite awkward to handle - I have small hands and the base is much wider than a blow dryer and wider than a hairbrush.  But I thought I&#x27;d better try it for a while before I gave up on it, and I&#x27;ve decided that it DOES work for me.  I find that because of the awkward grip I need to use two hands:  one to control my hair, and one to hold this brush.  However, to use a regular blow dryer I&#x27;d really need 3 hands to do it right, and I&#x27;ve never been able to find that 3rd hand.  So this ends up being easier to use than my regular blow dryer/brush combination, and I think my hair looks better.  I find it is easier to dry in layers with this tool, which results in straighter hair; and it is easier to go over the same patch of hair, which also straightens it further.  I&#x27;ve seen some complaints about the lack of heat/power on this, but I just let my hair get mostly dry before I start using it, and then it goes quickly enough.  And I think that the lack of blowing is a good thing - it&#x27;s easier to control the hair on the brush, which then results in a smoother result.  (FYI:  I have shoulder-length curly/frizzy hair, not super thick)</li>
    <li> Good feel, lightweight and works great! This does a great job drying your hair and is very easy to handle</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this. This would work best for short hair.  Not enough power to dry long hair. I wish it was more powerful!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, made my hair much smoother than using a brush AND blowdryer.  Lightweight, just hope it will last!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, though might not be as good at holding a curl as I&#x27;d like. Glad to have the right size as the other I had that was much more expensive was huge and very hard to manage.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product because, as far as I can tell, it is the only hot air brush on the market with such a large brush head. I bought it while visiting family and spent well more than Amazon sells it for so I could have it right away. It&#x27;s a very nice appliance with one important exception, it is seriously underpowered at 500 watts. My [[ASIN:B003JMYYQW Jilbere Hot Air Brush]] is 1000 watts and works great with the exception of the small diameter brush head.  If only the John Frieda brush had increased the wattage, I would keep this and be a happy owner. Until then, it takes too long to dry my hair, even from damp, and with the extended exposure to heat, it will likely cause excessive damage as well.</li>
    <li> I like this hot air brush a lot. Have not used my hair dryer since I purchased it a couple of months ago. The reason I did not give it five stars is because the on and off button is hard to operate.  It&#x27;s hard to find it when you are using the brush with one hand.  And it&#x27;s a little stiff to move from one setting to the next.  Other than that, I love the brush and use it every day. Makes my hair smooth with a lot of body.</li>
    <li> First - I&#x27;ll note that I thought this thing rotated - It does not. I should read things more carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with that, though, I love this thing. It does take longer to do my hair with it than when I just do a quick curl with a large curling iron, but it looks so much better. With the hot air brush, my hair looks like it does when I leave the salon. I&#x27;ve never been able to give myself a decent blowout before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thin hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl or have much volume. This brush doesn&#x27;t exactly give a ton of volume, exactly, but it does make everything sleek and flowy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend that you dry your hair 75% of the way before you start using, or you&#x27;ll be waiting and waiting and waiting to get your hair dry.</li>
    <li> Product update: I bought this hot air brush 5 or 6 years ago and it&#x27;s still works perfectly. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I use a hair dryer to damp dry my hair, then use this styler to smooth.  I have straight, fine shouider length hair, and a few cowlicks that create an uneven appearance;  This styler tames the cowlicks better than the other 5 or 6 styling brushes I have gone through.  Most other stylers have lasted about a year, then short out where the cord it is attached to the base of the barrel.  The swiveling cord base on this model might guarantee a little more longevity. Plus, it&#x27;s quieter and feels a little more substantial, but not heavy. Maybe better insulation.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is the sliding on/off button. The raised lines on the sliding button aren&#x27;t substantial, and if you have any product on your finger, you won&#x27;t be able to slide the button, no traction.  When I start to curl the next section, I often have to re-grasp the styler and use my fingernail to pull the slider back to the heat setting. Aside from button issue, very pleased with this product. Glad I switched from buying yet another styler at the local pharmacy to the Frieda air brush.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to quickly dry and style my hair in the morning without having to handle a separate brush and blow dryer. This is NOT that product. It has barely any power, so I have to use the hair dryer first and once I&#x27;ve done that, this brush doesn&#x27;t add any value. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this...replaces my blow dryer and hot iron....For longer hair you would prob have to use blowdryer too..Brush is too big for short hair......</li>
    <li> I tried this brush after going through countless Conair Infiniti Hair Designers that burned out after less than a year.  Initially I had planned to buy the Conair Infiniti rotating brush because it appeared that you could remove the brush unit to clean it (thus preventing the burn out problem with the Designer) and the rotating brush feature.  However, the 2\\&quot; barrel of the Conair was just too large for my baby fine, not-quite-shoulder length hair.  I then saw the John Frieda brush and with the 1 1/2 inch barrel, it&#x27;s perfect for my hair.  It has 3 settings, low, high and cool.  I use the higher setting just for time savings.  My hair dries quickly and has lots of volume.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the tip gets a little too hot on the high setting to handle if you want to \\&quot;guide\\&quot; the brush.  However, the brush is light enough that \\&quot;guiding\\&quot; is not really necessary.  It would be nice though if there was a tip that was cooler to the touch.</li>
    <li> i received the product today, and before even opening the box, i could tell it had been previously opened.  upon opening it, i found hair in the bristles, wrapped up in the cord tie, etc.  will be returning it and NOT re-ordering.  yuck!</li>
    <li> Purchased this in July, it&#x27;s now December and it has already broken. Ruined my day. I was halfway through drying my hair and it just stopped working. It was great before that.</li>
    <li> This is so much easier to use than a dryer and brush. The handle diameter is a comfortable size so my hand doesn&#x27;t cramp. It is light-weight so your arm doesn&#x27;t get tired holding it. And with High, Low and Cool settings it locks the curl in with the Cool setting at the end.&lt;br /&gt;It gives you a professional styling ability at a most-reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I saw this product in the Ladies Home Journal magazine recommended to others.  I needed a product that was easy and liked having the hair dryer and brush all in one tool.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I felt comfortable about buying this dryer.  I have thick hair and many reviews commented on how the dryer would be able to power through.  Not so!  I could dry my hair faster by just blowing on it.  There were moments I had to stick my hand over the brush just to see if any air was coming out.  It went back.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she was afraid that it will not be hot enough to dry her hair but after testing it it worked like a charm</li>
    <li> Oh my, it works!!  love this !!  Best device invention ever!! Highly recommend this product and I hardly ever recommend a product</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I bought it months ago after reading great things about it and almost returned it because I didn&#x27;t want more clutter in my bathroom.  I finally decided to give it a whirl and I&#x27;m just amazed at how great my hair looks!  Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t return it!  I have fine, wavy hair but I have a lot of it.  This takes all the grunt work out of a blow-out and my hair actually looks better than with a salon blow-out because there is so much volume.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I purchased the John Frieda Hot Air Brush after using a similar Panasonic Brush-Style Hair Dyer at my mother-in-law&#x27;s house.  (She had an old dryer that she had purchased in Taiwan years ago that I thought worked really well).  After using the John Frieda dyer once, I was very disappointed.  On the hottest setting, it would have taken 45 minutes to dry my hair completely!  The dyer didn&#x27;t heat up nearly enough.  I stuck with it for the first dry anyway to see how my hair would come out, and because it took SO LONG, my hair didn&#x27;t even look smooth afterwards.  It was almost like my hair was air drying as the brush was &amp;#34;doing it&#x27;s thing.&amp;#34;  I returned this product.  As an aside, I have since located the same hair dyer that my mother-in-law purchased in Taiwan on Amazon.  It&#x27;s actually a Japan import, but it works PERFECTLY.  Dries my hair in 10 minutes (and I have thick, past-shoulder length hair!)  It&#x27;s the Panasonic KURUKURU Low-Noise Dryer PINK EH-KA15-P(Japan Import) -- you can see my detailed review about it there.  Good luck if you decide to go with the John Frieda dryer!  Happy days if you decide to go with the Panasonic alternative!</li>
    <li> Barely got the chance to use this product. About 10 seconds into using it for the first time, I recieved an electric shock. I can only compliment Amazon&#x27;s wonderful customer service. They were friendly and helped me promptly with information regarding my return. I wish I could try this product, but am too hesitant to try again with another one. **Update: Followed up with John Frieda/CONAIR claims department who did nothing to stand behind their product. I set up a claim, but it was dismissed.</li>
    <li> I really like the bristle style and spacing of this brush, they&#x27;re durable and placed for optimal venting, but I wish the fan was stronger. The heat level is perfect, never uncomfortably hot, even after a half hour of styling, and the cool is sincerely cool, not just warm. I thought the cord would be a little cumbersome, but I keep it half-bound with the cord-collector it came with and it works great with the swivel bottom, no tangles or swirling. The bottom is easy to remove for cleaning the intake vent and snaps on with a nice &#x27;click&#x27;, I don&#x27;t think it will just fall off and roll away.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a really nice tool, but the fan could use a boost, I usually run the brush on low alongside my hairdryer on cool to decrease my styling time.</li>
    <li> I have been using my hair dryer and then a brush curling iron and thought the hot air brush would save me time.  Although it works find, I have short layers and wish the size of the brush were smaller.  If I had longer hair, I&#x27;m sure it would give me the volume I need.</li>
    <li> The John Frieda hot air brush was introduced on The View as one of 2013&#x27;s hottest items.  So I decided to purchase it, and haven&#x27;t regretted it once.  The ease of handling one item to dry and style my hair is gratifying.  Now what do I do with a drawer full of styling brushes and two blow dryers? (hmmmm)</li>
    <li> I prefer to dry my hair with a brush rather than just blowing it dry.  My hair is curly and gets frizzy easily.  This drier works perfectly, not too hot, and also has the cooler styling setting.  I rarely even have to use a flat iron after drying my hair now, I can get it dried and styled in no time.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping I could avoid carrying several hair care tools while travelling but this proved useless. The heat was way too mild and the brush really did not work for my long-ish hair. Had to return it.</li>
    <li> Product is too big &amp; too heavy.  I returned it. I g o t  credit with no problem.  Way to go A mazon.</li>
    <li> Really liked this hot air brush but the barrel was too big for my short hair. I would buy this again if there was a smaller diameter available.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to keep this brush. I liked the feel of the handle, the ease of grabbing hair and wrapping around the brush, and the amount of heat, but the main purpose of a hot air brush--to style--didn&#x27;t happen.  I have shoulder length, thick, mostly straight hair. I want a styler to give body, fullness and turn under the ends of my hair.  I have another hot air ion brush this size, but it&#x27;s so hot I have actually burned my ears.  This one didn&#x27;t seem like it would do that.  But after using it my hair was flat, limp and had little to no \\&quot;curl\\&quot; on the ends.  I kept trying options:  more time on high, cooling and every combination I could think of, but the result was the same--lifeless hair.  Maybe the extra ions cause it. So reluctantly I returned it and went back to my old \\&quot;too hot\\&quot; brush.  At least in a matter of minutes I&#x27;m fluffed from sleeping or tamed from drying and ready to go--if I can just keep from burning my ears.  If you want flat, smooth, mostly straight hair this would likely work for you.  It wasn&#x27;t what I needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy and pleased with this product. I wanted to save money from going to the beauty salon, but wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to spend on the expensive InStyler. This is also the first time I buy an electric tool of any for hair styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thin, but this brush doesn&#x27;t damage it all. Instead, it leaves it very smooth and leaves a shine to it. The Hot level doesn&#x27;t burn your scalp like others do and doesn&#x27;t tangle individual hairs that sometimes pull out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I misundertood that the brush rotated, when actually it&#x27;s the base, where the chord connects, the one that rotates. It isn&#x27;t a problem though, but an unexpected advantage because it helps prevent any chord tangling at all. My only problem is that the barrel is somewhat too big for my hair, since I wear it short, but other than that I use it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend getting this one.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected and I have short hair.  I did not find it that easy to use one handed very long either for the John Frieda hot air brush which I saw advertise in a magazine.  I was not happy and was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Size is somewhat clumsy to hold, but just need getting used to it.  HOWEVER, used it one time and my hair bounces.  Wow!</li>
    <li> Good transaction; good price.</li>
    <li> Sadly, there is no way this brush will work with hair that is not very long.  As mine is just above the shoulders, I will have to pay to return this item.  I wish that the description would have said that it only works with very long hair.  This was a waste of time and money as it is completely unusable.  What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> I liked how fast I could dry my hair plus style at the same time. Loved how it made my hair soft and full looking.</li>
    <li> This works well on my short hair.  I can curl it under pretty quickly.  I have thick hair, so it is not really fast.  But boy it is a timesaver.  Only holding one item to dry hair.  I am very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered and paid for a new hot brush, but the first time I opened the package, I found someone else&#x27;s hair stuck in the brush.  Yuck!  Amazon needs to replace this one and pay for the shipping if they want the first one back.  This is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> I have long, straight hair. I usually blow dry without much brushing and then get a finishing touch using my CHI. I bought this hoping that I could combine the drying and straightening process. The directions are good, you definitely cannot start with soaking wet hair. I dry my hair with the blower until its about 75% dry, then use this to finish it off. While it does give some bounce, especially on the ends where it gives a light curl, it doesn&#x27;t do anything about flyaways and frizziness. I still have to use my straightener on the top layers to get that smooth look. I do feel that it does less heat damage than my blower, and I definitely notice more volume and like I said earlier, the slight curling on the bottom looks nice. Even though I now use 3 appliances, I feel it is worth it because there seems to be less heat with this tool than my dryer and I only have to straighten the top layer, not every hair.</li>
    <li> This thing is absolutely the most indispensable hair care appliance I have ever owned.  It has totally changed how I take care of my hair - I used to DREAD blow-drying with hair dryer and brushes, so hard, such a pain, and never being able to properly do the back!  And it took forever.  With this gorgeous all-in-one, I get a salon look in 10 minutes, I kid you not.  It is FANTASTIC.  It dries, smooths, de-frizzes, curls (if you want).  It has two drying speeds, the higher one gets pretty hot.  My only (and small) complaint is that the tip of it can get very hot, so just be careful with that if its been on for a while.  I feel like buying two of these so I never have to worry about it going off the market.  If there were 6 stars, this little device would get it.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product ever.  I can not for the life of me blow out with a round brush.  This works so easily.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Adds volume to my roots quickly!</li>
    <li> Love this air brush!  Dries hair quickly with no frizz.  Can dry it with curls or straight.</li>
    <li> I use this more than I use my straightener! It dries up my hair without damaging it and adds beautiful bounces to my layers.&lt;br /&gt;I have super thick and curly indian hair so I was really taken away at how effective and fast it is!</li>
    <li> In order for this to work you would really need to dry your hair with a blow dryer first. I&#x27;ve used it maybe once or twice.</li>
    <li> The bristles were falling out.  I thought it was just for the first use but it did again and even when I packed it for return.  It did get hot and dried my hair but my curly hair looked like pageant hair!</li>
    <li> Great styling tool for medium to long hair. My hairdresser liked mine so well she ordered one for herself to use on her other clients. I have medium length hair with an under cut so I half dry my hair with a blow dryer and concentrate on the roots.  I finish it off with my John Frieda and it makes my hair shiny and silky. It&#x27;s the healthiest looking hair I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
    <li> Wish the brush rotated!</li>
    <li> love this tool!  fast shipping too</li>
    <li> Nice idea and I had been looking for this size forever. There&#x27;s just not enough power. It takes forever to try your hair with this and I have short a-line fine hair.</li>
    <li> Great product.gently dries my thin fine hair and gives it &amp;#34;life&amp;#34;sorry I didn&#x27;t find it sooner. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> just love it use it all the time. great  item everyone should have one, no fizz hair very happy. thanks</li>
    <li> I have short hair, and it is too big, I will probably give it away to a friend.Just too much for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never spent a ton of time styling my hair in the morning before I go to work. I have thick and wavy hair that takes forever to dry. But when I found this brush , I just absolutely love how much easier it makes it. It&#x27;s perfect for my hair. It instantaneously dries and styles my hair while still giving me time to put on make up before leaving for work. It is very handy I should say. Not other bulky brushes that I used to have.</li>
    <li> While trying to achieve the hair dresser blow out style and struggling with holding a brush and a hair dryer was a disaster. So i looked into hot air brushes and saw good reviews on this one. My Hot Air Brushed arrived in very nice time and full packaging. It is lightweight and easy to use. I actually havent used it on wet hair yet but it styles dry hair very nicely as well. Its great to have the cold shot at the end to hold the curl. Perfect for curling or straightining the hair. The barrel is on the larger side so if you are looking for tight little curls this is not your product. Works really well not too loud and easy to hold. Nice long cord for easy use. So excited to use this product for great looking hair! :) Holds the hair really tight wich is nice. Great price great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> I have straight fine hair, and this dryer leaves my hair silky smooth after drying.  I used to let it air dry because regular dryers would just blow my hair all over the place, but this dryer truly styles my hair as well.  Now I don&#x27;t have to use two appliances, only one.  Love it!  My mother has thicker, wavy hair and this dryer is not hot enough to style her hair, though.</li>
    <li> I have thick bi-racial curly hair that I blow dry and flat iron.  So I need a serious dryer.  This one is pretty good, it fits well in my hand.  The bristles are fantastic, they grip my hair to where I can almost do it one-handed.  My hair was a lot smoother than my old con-air brush dryer.  I like that the brush does not detach.  My old one had two attachments which meant that it had a little clip to hold them in place.  That eventually broke which was why I had to buy a new one.  The one thing that is not so great is the wattage.  It doesn&#x27;t blow as much air as my old one and takes a little longer to dry my hair but it&#x27;s sufficient.  I do have thick hair.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.  I leaves my hair shinier and softer.  And frizz free.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs.  I love the cool air feature.</li>
    <li> Do dry your hair about 80% before you use this.  Round brush and hair dryer all in one. Works great, I really like it.  Adds body, lifts roots and the body and bit of curl was still there the next morning, so not only did I not have to wash my hair on the second day (I usually wash it every day), it still had body.  I just had to fluff it up a little bit, and bam....I&#x27;m out of the door.  I&#x27;m excited about my new toy.  My hair is shoulder length and medium/thick and naturally wavy.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing invention. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s different than the tiny thing I used before...I never got the hang of it. I have thinning, fine hair. Creative combing/teasing is always necessary. Not now; I have silky, thicker hair and the creative tease needed at the crown isn&#x27;t a must. I run through it with a small-tooth comb, a little hairspray and voila! It stays cleaner, silkier longer-the look hairstylists get. I always wash everyday. I can get by with skipping a day. HERE&#x27;S the hassle. To work my hair correctly, I hit it with that cool blast at the end. I can&#x27;t find the freakin&#x27; button now. It&#x27;s in different places every time I dry a different portion of hair. This would be a perfect product but that cool button business is a total annoyance. I hope Mr. Frieda will redesign this brush and &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; us initial buyers with the new version.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s the best air/hair brush I&#x27;ve had; It feels soft against your scalp; It doesn&#x27;t burn your hands or scalp, and because I have shorter hair, I would redefine it for a more practical use by extending a longer tip at the end to be able to grab it with your left or right hand to have better control while you style your hair around the top of your head. There&#x27;s nothing like that on the market that I know of.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;re many of us that do not have the hand coordination to use a separate brush with a regular hair dryer. This is a great alternative. It takes less time and you have better control while styling.&lt;br /&gt;Oooh!! if they only let me design some of the products that are made for women, we&#x27;d all be so much better off.</li>
    <li> I would rate it between 3 and 4 stars. It did a great job of drying my hair quickly as compared to traditional blow dryer. I have thick hair so I had to flat iron it after drying for styling. However, it still was easier and more effective than having to use a brush and blow dryer. The heat went exactly where you want it.</li>
    <li> I did not realize the barrel is much too large to do my short hair properly.  Otherwise it is a nice product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is certainly much easier than using a traditional blow dryer and a separate round brush -- I always felt like I needed three hands to juggle those tools!  This hot air brush is not near as powerful as a regular hair dryer, so I get my hair 80-90% dry with a regular dryer first, then style with this tool.  I was afraid my fine hair would slip through the brush, but the bristle grip my hair great!  Some reviews complained about the end getting hot, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that -- plus I don&#x27;t find it necessary to hold the end while using the brush.  The brush works pretty well, but since it&#x27;s less powerful it does take a bit more time than a dryer with a separate brush.  I also can&#x27;t get my wavy hair quite as straight as with a dryer and brush, but it&#x27;s pretty close.  Overall, I&#x27;d say this brush is worth trying just because it&#x27;s so easy to use and I do still use this brush, but it&#x27;s not quite the miracle product I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this brush.  You have to get your hair pretty close to dry to use it though, and at that point, my hair is too long/too thick to get all my hair before it all dries.  I wish it got just a little hotter/blew air a little bit harder.  I think its great for thin hair!  But it&#x27;s not the best for thick/wavy hair.</li>
    <li> i never need to go to the hair salon for blow dry!!! my hair are thick and i live in humid weather but it is doing an amazing job</li>
    <li> Good barrel size but not very powerful , probably would be fine for thinner hair</li>
    <li> This is a tuff one for me to rate.  I was excited to try this one as it was cheaper than the one I usually purchase but the handle is so thick I can barely hang on to it.  I am 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; tall (not a tiny person) and have average hand size for my height but I can&#x27;t even wrap my hand all the way around this fat handle, making it difficult to hang on to.  Let me also say that I have had arthritis since my teens so hanging on to things is difficult anyway but this just made it more difficult. The product ended up in the closet and I went back to my old stand by.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. I still use a blow dryer wirh it and I have thin fine hair but it heats up well. Need to use it more to totally feel comfortable. Great price for what you get.</li>
    <li> Product dries out your hair and leaves it in worse condition. Just use a round brush and a hair dryer and don&#x27;t bother purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Love the size, has 2 speeds for the air speed. Really works well giving body to my fine limp hair. Easy roll and curl, haven&#x27;t had many troubles with snarling hair. Definitely a good choice in my hair care.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It does a fine job and works nicely.  Not so hot that it burns your hair.  Three settings, low speed warm, high speed hot, high speed cool.  I generally use the high speed hot setting and then flip the switch to the cool setting to set the curl.  I wanted to guy it in a smaller barrel but they don&#x27;t seem to have it anymore.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer brush, wish it rotated but it did say it didnt rotate in the description, the price was good and so were the reviews so I decided to try it, works great for just drying a little bit of hair.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good value for the money.  It does what it says it will do, but I&#x27;m not overly impressed.  I only ordered this air brush because I thought mine wasn&#x27;t as hot as it could be.  After trying this air brush one time, I went back to using my old one.  This air brush should be redesigned!  The buttons are in a terrible place and the handle is too big.  I have no complaints about the air brush not being hot enough (it is not a curling iron). . . in my opinion, if it were any hotter it would be damaging to the hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about this item, other than I exchanged it for the Conair Infiniti Pro b/c the Conair rotated and this JF one did not. I am sure it is a good item which is why I rate 3 stars, but I paid a little more to get what I really wanted.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and makes my normally frizzy hair soft, straight, smooth, and voluminous!</li>
    <li> If u have short (shoulder length) hair... This is for u! Awesome product...! The only 1 negative point is it takes time to dry ur hair.. So just dry hair 60% with regular dryer first!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brush-blow dryers and really didn&#x27;t need this because I use a flat iron on my hair.  But I get tired of the time it takes to flat iron and thought I&#x27;d try this Hot Air Brush to see if it would help smooth out my hair when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  What a pleasant surprize!  This is the best air brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  It gets really hot and dries my hair quick with body and curl.  I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I usually have specific brands that I know and love that are indeed, a little more high-end. But I have been pleasantly surprised by the hot air brush. I am a hair stylist, so I am really comfortable with a round brush and dryer. But this has indeed been great for my own hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 1 inch, and it was perfect for my A-line Bob. Volume, shine and frizz- control is definitely all things that this item has to offer.</li>
    <li> Nice air brush - really suited for thin or fine hair but works pretty well for thicker hair too - brushes get stuck a bit in thick hair so need to take time - good heat though .</li>
    <li> This makes it so much easier to style my long layers!  Love it.</li>
    <li> This product works! Gives my medium length hair volume and shine. I do find, as another rater mentioned, that it works best  if I use my hair dryer first to dry my hair a bit before using this appliance. I can&#x27;t tell you how much money I&#x27;ve wasted on hot rollers, curling irons et al. My search has ended! This John Frieda Hot Air Brush is the bomb.</li>
    <li> Time ago a got bought here on amazon a keratin smoothing sistem from keratinresearch (great product), and it gave such a great result that i no longer go to the salon, my hair is a mix between straight, wavy and curly and the process of dyeing it has left it frizzy, the keratin treatment left my hair frizz-free, so soft and manageable, well the point is that my hair is so great now that i dont need to go to the salon anymore but i still have to use some hot tool to shape it in my case was the traditional blowdryer and a hair brush which is very complicated and too hot, so i started looking for a hot air brush and found the john freida, i also cheked on conair spin hot air brush but some reviewers said that the spin function is useless if you have long hair and it makes sense,  so I bought the john freida and I have to say im sooooo happy, this is perfect, I just let my hair air dry and use it when my hair is almost completely dry and it works wonderful, the ion technology really works, I was skeptical at first about that ion thing but its true, I noticed the difference between this and my old conventional blowdryer, the hair looks shinier and less frizzy and in less than 10 minutes I&#x27;m done!!!! My hair is so shiny, soft with volume, I can give waves to my hair and also get it straight with this, the fact that this is ment to be used when the hair is almost dry is great because the hair is less exposed to heat damage, some people complain that it cant used on wet hair but its supposed to be like that and its so much better, thanks John freida for this product I just wish I had discover this earlier.</li>
    <li> Too uncomfortable to hold and style because the barrel is too wide for my hand.  I have normal size hands I think; the thinner barrel is much easier to handle.</li>
    <li> and this didn&#x27;t do it.... it&#x27;s only good for drying and styling the ends of your hair... and I need to get volume to the tops of my hair...</li>
    <li> I like everything about it except it need more power. It takes too long to dry my hair, and I blow dry my hair most of the way before i use it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure out why this product works so well, but it has transformed my daily hair styling.  I have short wavy hair and have always been terrible at blow drying.  I am small, my arms are short, and I have arthritis in my thumbs, so manipulating a regular round brush is difficult.  This product really shortens the time to style, is simple to use and gets MUCH better results than with a regular blowdryer.  I have the 1.5 inch one, and also bought the smaller 1 inch model to make sure I am always able to use it - even when my hairdresser cuts my hair too short.  I am recommending it to everyone.  Just dry your hair about 80% with a regular blowdryer first.</li>
    <li> Bought this in Jan and stopped working in March on its own. Just didn&#x27;t start!!&lt;br /&gt;Was working great but now I am questioning the quality of this product. I am a new mum and couldnt get in touch with customer service team earlier. Wondering if I will get a replacement or my money back since its April now..&lt;br /&gt;Not happy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Conair hair dryers and have been happy with them. But then I saw this, I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Guess what?!? It&#x27;s another Conair dryer. I found it a bit tedious to use, moreso than using a dryer and a brush. The brush didn&#x27;t really grab onto my hair without me using two hands to make sure it grabbed. It also doesn&#x27;t have much power, so took too long to dry my hair. My hair is naturally curly but I dry it straight. This hot air brush did a good job of that, but not any better or worse than using my more powerful, faster, dryer and brush method. Since I&#x27;m usually rushed in the morning, slower hair drying isn&#x27;t a better option for me, so I unfortunately had to send this item back.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hot air brush for my grand daughter and she really likes it.  I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints about it.</li>
    <li> I hate this product. It makes my hair really frizzy and despite the convenience of the round brush, I would rather blow dry my hair and use more energy and time than to use this because it makes my hair look so bad. I wish I had returned it.</li>
    <li> I like my brush blower.  I really like the soft brush bristles.  I wish it had the choice of a 1 inch and 1 1/2 inch barrel.</li>
    <li> I really like this hot air brush. You have to be careful and not turn it all the way up or there is not heat.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product like this, but I wish I had. It makes doing your hair much easier and it saves time too!</li>
    <li> Have needed something like this for years.  It saves time and makes much more sense to use something like this.</li>
    <li> So much easier than using both a blowdryer and a round brush! Love this; wish it would have come out years ago!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this product, it lets me style my hair at home as well as when my hair dresser does it.  It is well worth the money and my only regrett is not getting something like this along time ago.  I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great, good price and has a variety of settings  .  The barrell is large and easy to use  Done</li>
    <li> can any one tell me where i can get a converter for this brush as i have tried and been told i cant  help</li>
    <li> I purchased this recently after my Helen of Troy just flat out died....and at a young age!  The brush is different than what I am used to but I am getting better with practice.  It does very well, has a good strong push of hot air and a cooling stage to set the style.  The only thing I think could be better is that you can sometime burn your fingers on the end, as the part that you usually hold is very thin.  Other than that (which is NOT a deal-breaker!), I have been quite happy with it!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how easy it is to style my hair now!  It works great on fine thin hair.  I like to so much I am going to buy another to keep at our camp. The price is very reasonable!!!</li>
    <li> It dries a bit too slow for my liking since I am impatient.  So I use the regular dryer to get it about 75% dry.  I then use the Hot Air Brush to finish it off.  I love that I don&#x27;t even have to use a straightener.  It is a great product and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this product, however a smaller barrel size would be better for making curls, waves. Also if they did a flat head version, I would purchase for grandsons to use.</li>
    <li> I was concerned this wouldn&#x27;t work on my shorter hair, but it did great, and is a huge time-saver.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush, it&#x27;s so versatile heat and brushing at the same time it styles my short hair quick and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with another hot air brush for years because I have had really bad luck with them.  I am so glad I read the other reviews and took a chance with this brush.  It is FANTASTIC!!!!  I have longer hair so I rough dry it with a regular hair dryer and then finish with the hot air brush.  This John Frieda hot air brush makes my hair shiny, full and soft and I have a great hair day every time I use it.  My old Revlon brush used to come apart on me while I was trying to style my hair (it had 2 different barrels you could switch) I would get so frustrated with the appliance that I stopped using it all together, it is now in the garbage!  If you are hesitating, don&#x27;t- get this hot air brush and you will love it as much as myself and the other reviewers!!</li>
    <li> Love this hot air brush. A great solution to the many hurry mornings getting ready for work. Dries hair quickly while smoothing it.</li>
    <li> I have spent way too much time and money, along with products, to achieve a smooth blow out. I can now achieve BETTER results at home. I have fine, curly, thick hair. I now have a good looking bob. I use this product a few times a day. In fact, I keep one in my car. The tool works best, for me, on dry hair. Please do not stop making this product.</li>
    <li> This product has saved me. I, for the life of me, cannot figure out how to blowdry my own hair with a round brush. This product has made my life so much easier!! Recommended.</li>
    <li> even though i have to dry my hair with a higher watts, the Frieda hot air brush makes my hair seem fuller, softer and styles it the way i want it.</li>
    <li> I like the Salon Shape. I can&#x27;t say it leaves my hair soft and shiny but it does a pretty good job of drying my thick, partially dry hair after washing. Even on the high heat setting it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> blower could be more powerful-takes quite awhile to dry hair. Other than than I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend it-but I find myself going back to the regular hair dryer using a roller brush -seems more effective.</li>
    <li> Takes a bit to heat up but does fine once hot enough</li>
    <li> Love it makes your hair full and shiny works better if your hair is damp dry also nice feature you can clean filter last one I had did not have that and burnt up</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have a lot of hair, but it is very fine.  This product tames the frizzies and makes my hair as soft and smooth as silk. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I purchased this hot air brush!  While I am not one to write reviews about products that I have purchased, I am only too happy to review this product.  It is so easy to use, even one handed, and I am certainly glad that I spent the money for this.  I have tried to find easy to use styling products, as I am not one to fuss with my hair, but this has proven to be easy to use, and does not require too much effort.  Since I was on the fence about making this purchase, I referred to the reviews that were already on Amazons website, and relied on those reviews to convince me that this would be a great styling tool for me, and surely it is.</li>
    <li> I returned this product because the brush area is too small and it took me forever to get my hair dried. It&#x27;s a good concept and I wish it had worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have difficulty using any electric hair styling devise, but this one is the best I have ever tried. It is easy to use, the cord does not get twisted up, and most impressive is the heat setting. It is low enough so it does not leave my hair brittle or dried out. I like it.</li>
    <li> Saw this item onThe View, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have long, fine hair and this hot air brush is wonderful!  It brushes in body and dries my hair gently without frying it like some hair driers do.  Great product!</li>
    <li> So easy to use! Leaves my hair shiny &amp; curls or just wavy! Not heavy, doesn&#x27;t burn your fingers. I love it!</li>
    <li> Although it does a fairly good job of styling, I find it heavy to hold and difficult to get it warm enough to dry efficently</li>
    <li> Love it. Just arrived on thursday and I had to try it right away. It took me a while to get the hang of it but once I did my hair ended up looking good. Happy with my purchase fast delivery. Hair is soft n no frizz! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to use less heating tools (straightner). Must have</li>
    <li> Yesterday I got this cute brush. Today I used it after I got out of the shower. I have two like this so I knew what I was getting myself into. However, I never got them this big before. Let me tell you, I&#x27;m glad I did. Right when I started up the brush, I grab a piece of hair like I normally do, and work my little fingers with this dryer. I was a bit surprised how fast it did to dry. This lasted a hour because I was opposing with my roots. I have issues with my corners of my forehead. But this baby did it in one shot. I love this thing so far. I am really happy with it. I never dry it wet because I have always been afraid I would burn my hair. If you don&#x27;t want to waste time, make sure your hair is dry before using it. This is from my experience. Wet hair takes forever.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and styled hair is smooth by this product. But the product may not have enough power, takes long time to dry the hair. Idealy use with hair dryer which is inconvenient that you have to have two products.</li>
    <li> This was an impulse buy on a pre-Christmas lightning sale and I am beyond happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually pretty lazy with my hair. I prefer to wash and go and rarely used my dryer. This is perfect for me. It lets me brush and dry my hair at the same time and I like the light styling I get from the large round brush shape. My hair looks almost as good as it does when I leave the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have two &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; to add -- and I&#x27;m still leaving five stars.&lt;br /&gt;1 - This isn&#x27;t an all-purpose blow dryer so it doesn&#x27;t reach the roots very well. Because of that, it&#x27;s easy to end up over-drying your ends and getting a little frizzy.... Maybe people who are more used to drying their won&#x27;t have that problem though.&lt;br /&gt;2 - If I&#x27;m not careful, my hair gets caught and pulled by the seam in the plastic handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I love it -- just read my title! :)  It&#x27;s easy to use and works great.</li>
    <li> If you have a little time in the morning, this Hot Air Brush does the trick.  It&#x27;s not as fast as a regular hair dryer, but it makes my hair look like I&#x27;ve had it blown out in a salon.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a hot air brush, so I purchased this one because it was on sale. I was a little skeptical that it would dry/curl my hair without tangling, but it does just that. I love the lift and volume it gives my hair, without having to try to maneuver a hair dryer and round brush at once. Definitely if you are interested in this product but are on the fence, go for it- it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> This product helps you to skip a step (drying) when styling your hair.  I was given one as a gift and liked it so much that I bought 2 as gifts for others!</li>
    <li> It did not work well at all for me.  I tried to use it twice and my hair was a mess.  I will donate it to a charity.</li>
    <li> I love this brush i have a medium bob.  My hair is thick and it takes a little more time than hairdrying but it feels great.  Sometimes if i&#x27;m in a hurry i run the blowdryer for a minute or two then airbrush...  Certainly helps get rid of where my hair tries to stick out in the back.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after reading positive reviews.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not working for me.  I have very fine, shoulder/chin length hair. I tried using this brush straight out of the shower (towel damp hair) and I felt like it was going to take years to dry my hair.  The brush made a lot of noise, but didn&#x27;t blow out much air.  The handle is awkward to hold, and flip your hair with, due to not only the cord but also the size/shape of the handle.  To speed up the process, I decided to blow dry my hair with my normal hair dryer, and then use this item to style- again, not impressed.  I&#x27;m going back to the blow dryer and barrel brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give this item 2 stars- It is light weight, and the brush itself made it through my hair multiple times without snagging or knotting.</li>
    <li> It was another recommendation from a magazine.  It works great but I had to give it to my mom.  My hair is very long and thick.  The bristles are light perfect for my mom&#x27;s short thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, unruly, frizzy and wavy/curly hair. I can&#x27;t tell you how impressed I am with this brush! My mom recommended it and I was like ok I&#x27;ll give it a try, what a find! It makes my hair is now bouncy and frizz free, which used to take forever for me to do, first blow drying then flat ironing, this is an all in one and much less damage!  The only one slight complaint is the power, since my hair is so thick I definitely need to air dry a bit before using or it will take quite awhile to dry with the brush, that&#x27;s a little frustrating but all in all it means less damage since its not crazy hot. I would absolutely recommend this!!</li>
    <li> I have fine textured wavy hair -- it is quite thick and about mid way between chin and shoulder, all one length.  I wash it every day at the gym, so am always looking to find ways to accelerate drying and styling.  For years I have been using a flat iron after completely drying.  I can usually get from dry to completely styled in about five minutes, with acceptable results.  I was intrigued by the idea of a drying brush after seeing some of the other women at the gym using them.  I picked the John Frieda after researching them because I liked that it did not rotate-- this just seemed like it would have more moving parts to fail, without adding functionality.  I liked the wider brush as I am trying to straighten waves, but still get my hair to turn under.  The iron was good for this but left my hair almost a little too flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used the Frieda brush I knew it was going to be a keeper for me.  I still dried my hair-- but not completely -- saved a little time there.  The brush gets  plenty  hot and quickly finishes the drying.  I spend about as much time with the brush as I had with the iron -- may-be a little less.  What I really like is that this brush gets your hair smooth and turned-under but without flattening it as much as using the iron.  It has much more volume.  I still need to fine tune the process but I think I really do prefer this to the iron.  The brush is easy to use, is quite hot enough on the high setting and gets your hair smooth on the cool setting.  I agree with the other poster that buttons or a turn button would be better than the slide control but this is really a tiny nit.</li>
    <li> Good quality for price.</li>
    <li> I had a dryer years ago with a brush attachment that always got stuck in my hair, so I was hesitant to try another one. This dryer got good reviews, so I wanted to try it.  I really love it!  It never gets tangled in my long hair, and I can style my hair while I am drying it.  It makes my hair smooth and less frizzy that your usual dryer.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works just as advertised and makes my hair very soft, smooth and full. I have fine, Color treated hair, hair that is half way down my back. It saves time by reducing the number of products and appliances I have to use each morning.</li>
    <li> This was not effective for my very long, very thick hair. While it did &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; it took much longer to use than I&#x27;d ever reasonably spend on my hair. I also noticed it didn&#x27;t completely rid my hair of frizz and I get much better results with the current routine I have now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would consider buying this if I had half the length and volume of hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great hot air brush. I was nervous trying out a new one brand , but love this one. I have long fine hair but  alot of it and it goes through my hair so smoothly. So i am not sure how it would work for other types of hair , but loved it for mine.</li>
    <li> Great for my frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This item was listed as helpful in controlling frizz, but for me it actually accentuated my frizz.  It wasn&#x27;t a useful tool in my kit, and I would love to return it... but of course can&#x27;t because I used it!  My hair is thick, straight with only some wave but does frizz in the humidity of the South.  Since this purchase I bought a Tempest 2000 Ionic hairdryer that works REALLY well taming my hair and drying in short order.</li>
    <li> Was not happy with this unit, very disappointed</li>
    <li> Love this styling tool! It keeps the frizzies to a minimum, and it is lightweight and easy to use. My sister bought one, too, after trying mine out. We have very different hair -- mine is fine and wavy, and hers is straight and thick -- it works great for both. Leaves your hair looking polished and professional. Towel dry your hair, then hit it with a blow dryer until it is slightly damp, then finish drying and styling with this hot air brush, and you will have salon-gorgeous hair; it&#x27;s so easy. Hair doesn&#x27;t tangle or snag, it never gets too hot -- it&#x27;s kind of perfect. We love it in our family!</li>
    <li> Very good, your hair are smooth and brilliant! Comfortable and safe , I like it because it makes your hair softy and fluent, lovely!</li>
    <li> I like this brush because it has a nice, hot touch and makes my hair nice and smooth as silk.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and using this to dry my hair was very time consuming. It works better on people with hair above their shoulders.</li>
    <li> So much better than my last one that I purchased at Walmart.  Really works well to style my fine, curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is fun to use, but does not dry hair efficiently.  Only lends a gentle wave to my daughters long thick hair.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I ever got!  Saves so much time.</li>
    <li> DISGUSTING!!!  I got someone&#x27;s returned brush!!!  Had a bunch of hair stuck in it.. grossed.  me.  out.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to be amazing. It&#x27;s a John Freida brand and I&#x27;ve read many great reviews but it he product is okay. When using this your hair has to be mostly dry because it doesn&#x27;t work well with completely wet hair so I suggest towel drying it first. When I tried it on my hair it was still slightly frizzy but the plus side is that it doesn&#x27;t get caught in your hair. Also the bristles are separated enough for less breakage.</li>
    <li> It works great for natural curly hair.  Also good for a quick pick up, for flat hair.  Don&#x27;t know what I did without it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful not to have to hold a blower and a brush.  This tool does it all and gives me more control thatn the two implements I used to use.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I went off product reviews when I bought this and have to say I HATE it and wish the return window were still open! I have medium-long, thick hair and after 10-15 minutes my hair could probably be called damp. With a normal hairdryer I can dry my hair in 5 minutes. Even the hottest setting on this does NOT get very hot and the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; speed is more like &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;. I think it would take 30+ minutes to dry and style my hair, which just isn&#x27;t possible with a baby in the house. I thought this would be a like a quick dry &amp; style all-in-one tool but was severely disappointed. The one pro I did find was that it made my hair less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I needed something that was low wattage that would effectively blow dry my hair in order for me to trim it myself every few weeks. This is the only hair dryer I could find that offers a low wattage. Reviews seemed good and I trust the brand. I have thick curly hair and this product works so well. I love it! I don&#x27;t use it to create curls, but I believe that it would work well if needed. So far so good. Recommended.</li>
    <li> it helps to lift hair makes better shape</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have fine short hair. I have trouble styling my hair.  This brush allows me to blow dry and style, without fussing.  Gives me body that holds.  I purchased the 1 1/2\\&quot;, I could of purchases the 1\\&quot; for my short hair.  But this this is the best dryer I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
    <li> My hair is short and fine.  This works perfectly for me and the low setting protects my hair.  the cool setting is helpful to &#x27;set&#x27; the curls.  However, if I had heavier hair or longer, I would never use the low setting.  It just wouldn&#x27;t dry fast enough.  This is not &#x27;high powered&#x27;, as some I&#x27;ve had in the past, but hotter ones have also done hair damage.</li>
    <li> does not tangle hair. Leaves a smooth, shiny, healthy result. My favorite hair dryer as of late.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It works really well.</li>
    <li> Most wonderful air brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very thick hair and the brush easily glides through my hair without tangling and leaves it smooth, silky and extra body.  I&#x27;ve been won over.</li>
    <li> does not dry hair and pulls</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush!! If I fall asleep with wet hair and wake up with a big mess of kinky/crimped hair, it takes me 10 minutes to brush through it, and leaves me with TAMED hair! Big fan. I don&#x27;t use it on my wet hair, as I have a lot of it, and the air that comes out of the brush isn&#x27;t sufficient for DRYING my hair completely.</li>
    <li> The answer I&#x27;ve been looking for!  My hair has been getting curlier and frizzier since I now have more silver in my hair.  I have tried numerous hair products and brushes to try to get my hair smoother and shinier.  As others have noted, use a more powerful hair dryer to get out of most of the moisture from your hair.  No need to worry how it looks.  Then watch the John Frieda Hot Air Brush quickly smooth and shape your hair as you finish the styling process.  What a great product.</li>
    <li> What a find! Works wonderful and so easy to use- your hair does not tangle in the bristles.</li>
    <li> I just got this and am already in love! My hair has been so damaged by straighteners, I never imagined I could have silky, smooth, shiny results like I have with this...amazing! And really no more time to complete styling with much better results...highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> this brush has completely replaced my blow dryer; in fact, I haven&#x27;t used my blowdryer since I bought this around 7 months ago. I will continue to purchase this product even if my current one eventually breaks down from everyday use. My recommendation, as other reviewers mentioned when I first researched this product, is to get dressed, prep your face, and do your make-up first before you begin drying your hair with this brush. My hair is very thin but has fluffy waves when it air dries, and at the time I made the purchase the length was halfway past my shoulders. What I do to preserve its health and what little remains in my scalp, is to only brush the hair that contours my face and the very top on the back, plus some stray hairs here and there. I don&#x27;t dry the whole thing by layers unless it is for a special occasion so the outcome is very natural. I hope it works for you too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this with many reservations because I&#x27;ve invested too much money in hair brushes and other hair toys.  When I opened it and plugged it in, I thought:  this isn&#x27;t going to work, it has too little power for my thick, heavy hair.  I&#x27;ve used it a week now and have to say, I am raving about it to everyone.  No tool I have ever bought has made my hair look the way it does after my hairdresser blows it dry--this one does and with a fraction of the work.  I don&#x27;t know how it works so well, but have a feeling that all this time we shouldn&#x27;t have been blowing our hair dry from above the dryer.  This is amazing and you&#x27;ll be glad you got it.  I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough and I have thick, unruly, course hair which is now shiney, bouncey and very easy to manage.  And oh yes, it&#x27;s better than the Instyler.</li>
    <li> Another one of my daughters Xmas presents.  Something to  cut down time when  doing her hair.  It is two items in one.  She used to use a blow dryer and a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush.  I dry most of my hair with my regular blow dryer and then use this to finish my style.  It is easy and fast to use and does not damage my hair like a hot iron.  I find it much easier to use than a round brush and a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> love the new brush.  i never bothered stying my hair and was intimidated by doing it.  this brush is so easy to use and makes my hair look like a pro did it.  love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had very healthy and very long hair. Each strand of hair individually is fine, but I have very thick head of hair. I bleached my hair from very very dark to light.  I also cut approx 10 inches to make a shoulder-length bob.  My hair is very fine, but there is a lot of it. So... the bleaching damaged the ends and the remainder of the hair was pretty frizzy/slightly damaged and unruly.  Just when I thought \\&quot;ok, sick of it, I&#x27;m going to a \\&quot;boy-cut\\&quot;, I saw the dryer offered on Amazon.  Purchased it.  Used it.  Now that my hair is smooth and I&#x27;m able to give it some body and control with this dryer, I am keeping it shoulder length and bobbed.  I recommend the product to anyone who wants control over their dry, damaged, course or fine, or over-processed hair.  Fabulous product John Frieda.</li>
    <li> Works very well. The only reason why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is because you still have to dry you hair with a blow dryer until its about 85% dry. This product did save me from having to damage my hair even more with a flat iron, so if you&#x27;re looking to save your hair from being damaged and still want some curl in the ends I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This brush is very well made and works great. Includes really great and useful attachments if you are in need of them.</li>
    <li> Tried the hot air brush after recommendations from family and friends.  Loved it.  It actually works just like it says.  Leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  Best of all, the low heat does not \\&quot;fry\\&quot; my hair.  This is the second John Frieda product I have purchased and I am definitely a fan.  I hope to find this quality in all their products.  I definitely recommend this hot air brush (JFHAS).</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m getting older and it&#x27;s hard holding a brush and hair dryer this is a must have it really saves your arms and works so good as I have super thick hair I love it</li>
    <li> Being lazy, I thought I could save a step when doing my hair after a shampoo. I have medium length hair. I was very disappointed and would have sent it back - but it did not seem worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;This tool does not do a great job of drying. It is not a a hair dryer. Rolling hair around it more than once will get your hair tangled in the brush.  It does heat up and it will curl the ends, but I went back to my traditional blower and large vented round brush. I also use a small cheap curling brush if I want extra curl on my ends.</li>
    <li> Not useful. Works ok. My hair is long and thick so perhaps not right for me. Great on my bangs but otherwise more work than its worth to get my hair to do what I want.</li>
    <li> This product was a let down for me. It doesn&#x27;t really work for me. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have waist length hair. First I ruffed dried my hair with my blow dryer as indicated on the Youtube tutorial made by HotandFlashy. But I didn&#x27;t like the way it styled my hair. I guess it&#x27;s all in hair preference and I prefer my long hair straight. I only use it once and didn&#x27;t like the feel of my hair afterwards. So now this product is just resting in my bathroom closet unused. So to me this product was a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, fine hair and will never go back to a regular hair dryer! This is a life saver. We went on vacation in Europe and I had to go back to the regular dryer, what a difference. I actually ended up buying a similar product over there since I missed my hot air brush so much, but it couldn&#x27;t live up to this one. This John Frida Hot Air Brush makes my hair feel soft &amp; shiny. I especially like the soft bristles. On days between washes I just spruce up my style with the cool style setting and am good to go. I would give it 10 stars, if I could!</li>
    <li> This hair tool is the BEST!  It is easy to use and the result is a smooth &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair and doing a blow out with my Babyliss hair dryer and a round brush takes me at least an hour.  With this brush, I blow dry my hair with the Babyliss until its about 80% dry and then use the JF Hot Air Brush to do the rest.  It only took about 20 minutes and it did a great job!  No more funky kinky areas in the back of my head that I couldn&#x27;t reach well with the round brush! This brush did a great job blowing out my curls with No hassle!  Awesome product!!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Works well on my long hair.  Smooths, seems more manageable.  I never had the coordination or patience for round brushing-this is so easy!  Do think is could be a bit stronger though, therefore the 4 star rating.  I dry my hair with my regular blow drier to 95% dry, then finish with this.</li>
    <li> With  some practice,I  have been very satisfied with the result . The control switch seems a bit flimsy. The brush seemed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too large, but it just takes working with it.</li>
    <li> I really thought this would be an easy great routine shortener and it was not. It barely blew air and I have very fine thin hair that take curl easily and this did not work for me. I only bought it to comb straight the curls on the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this John Frieda hot brush.  It is worth every penny.  After years of trying to style with a round brush and blowdryer, this has been the answer.  I love it and recommend it to anyone with chin length or longer hair.  Hair looks smooth and shiny after using this.</li>
    <li> I dont know if it is because my hair is soo straight or if it is the product, but my hair did not wave or curl up or under.  All it really did was make my hair all staticy and pull it out.</li>
    <li> I have mid length, thick, straight hair.  This brush will dry and style my hair with ease in about 10-15 minutes.  I no longer use a blow dryer as this tool does the work of blow dryer and curling iron all at once.</li>
    <li> I already have one of these.  It is so wonderful, that I was possessed of the fear that something might happen to it, and they would cease to manufacture it.  (It happens).  So I bought a second one to keep squirreled away, just in case.  It is so convenient to have brush and dryer in one piece.  This little appliance dries my hair - on low - in just a couple of minutes, and it always looks great.  So glad to have discovered it!</li>
    <li> the hot air is not that strong so it wouldn&#x27;t try or style your hair!</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. It makes my hair look like I just got a blow out from the salon. It&#x27;s so hard to manage a round brush in one hand and a hair dryer in the other and this hair dryer combines the two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also used it on my sister in law&#x27;s hair which is SUPER kinky curling (think jerry curl like 12&amp;#34; long) and she loved it. She still had to use a straightener but it made the process so much easier! I bought one for her too.</li>
    <li> My hair turned out so nice that my boss instantly noticed my hair and purchased herself one online within 5 minutes! Wow!</li>
    <li> Love this hot air brush.  No tangles.  Dries hair quickly.  Would recommend it to others.  Received it timely and quickly.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and used to spend almost 40 minutes every morning doing my hair now it takes me less than 10 minutes and I have a great looking salon hairdo.  My hair looks great and holds up all day.  I absolutely love and would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If was a gift, she loved it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> i bought this because it was highly rated. Well, the combs were too soft and easily bent and couldn&#x27;t go through my hair at all. We threw it away.</li>
    <li> I really love it. It works so great and my hair always looks really good after I use it.</li>
    <li> When my old one went kaput I needed a new one - the 1.5&amp;#34; size was not easy to find  - but I found it here with this John Frieda Hot Air Brush.  I used it for the first time yesterday and am veryy satisfied with it.  My tip is the same as other reviewers:  Don&#x27;t use it on totally wet hair.  Partially air dry or blow dry your hair first - then do one section at a time - using clips to pin-up top layers in order to do underneath layers first.  I know from experience that when you use this when you first wash your hair you can then get at least 2-3 days out of your style, using the brush on slightly dampened hair each day to freshen it up.  Personally, I can go a week - but I know a lot of people find that gross - but really with hair like mine it works best in order to achieve the texture needed for most hairstyles.  I also use Volumizing Powder - which is a fantastic invention for people with fine/slippery hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with static using the brush and need to find a solution for that.  Once I do I&#x27;ll add another star to this review. I&#x27;m sure that  using an additional hair product (or Static Guard) will take care of that issue.  This tool is super easy to use - much better than a blow dryer and a round brush - which I have always found very cumbersome to do.  Very good price on this too!</li>
    <li> I have just used this  once since I got it.  It works great.  My hair looked really nice with not a lot of effort.</li>
    <li> This is a gift so I am unable to rate.</li>
    <li> watch tutorials on youtube for tips on how to use it. makes my hair shine. looks/feels like i had a blow out. doesn&#x27;t tangle or pull at my hair like when you&#x27;re at a salon. good product.</li>
    <li> This is a great styling tool. The bristles are soft, so hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in them. I used to round brush my hair, but it&#x27;s so much easier to have the dryer and round brush in one! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have never been one to do too much with my hair. I was blessed with thick hair that looks decent with minimal product and only holds a style (curl) for about an hour - so what was the point of doing much, right? I bought this product because I wanted my hair to look more professional for work but I&#x27;ve tried blowdrying with a round brush and I just don&#x27;t have the time or the triceps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this I used a heat protectant and detangling spray and dried it the way I would if I were to try curling it and I could not believe how much volume and wave I got. I did not get curls, nor did I expect them, but my hair was in a beautiful wave that stayed, not only all day, but was still there the next morning! This is unheard of in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week I found that if you pin curl your hair back as you dry it off in sections and then go do your makeup or whatever, the curls do stay! I never thought I&#x27;d be able to manage having styled hair, but this has really done it for me.</li>
    <li> I love this hairbrush. When I ordered it, it was out of stock, but arrived after two weeks. I have wavy hair which is fine but full. The appliance is very light and easy to use--will not fatigue your hands like using a blow dryer and a brush at the same time.  If you have a lot of hair like I do, blow dry it 80% dry then section your hair and blow dry each section. Make sure you use the cold setting before you unravel your hair from the brush to give you a nice long lasting smooth finish. Happy blow drying!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0056GDG90 John Frieda JFHA5&lt;br /&gt; Hot Air Brush]]As always the transaction with Amazon was fast and easy. I had read many reviews, all glowing.  The hot air brush was very easy to use.  The downer was that it made my hair unbelievably flat.  The diameter of the brush was much bigger than I expected. I have shortish hair, but even so the brush held the hair nicely.  It just gave me no volume and no curl.  Maybe it&#x27;s intended for people with curly hair who want to smooth it. One reviewer said they received brushes of two sizes; the smaller barrel might have given more bounce. The product details say the brush is one &amp; a half in. in diameter and it probably was so I just didn&#x27;t comprehend the straightening effect.  Sorry it did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griff</li>
    <li> I must admit I am a skeptic. I bought it thinking it probably wouldn&#x27;t work as well as I wanted. I&#x27;m surprised and happy with this product. At first I didn&#x27;t think the motor was powerful enough but it is. I do have fine hair and I use a big blower to dry my hair most of the way then roll up the ends with this dryer and it bends and curls it in all the right places.  So far this works great and was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I had doubts when I ordered this because in the past I have just invested way too much money on multiple hair brushers, straighteners, treatment, the lot...I just spend so much on my hair! I have extremely thick and voluminous hair so my initial reaction when I opened this package was that it was not going to work. I was wrong, it is great and I have been incessant in telling my friends so. This one makes my hair look amazing without a blow dryer, I cannot recommend it highly enough and my hair is no longer knotted and tangly.</li>
    <li> I am really happy I purchased this product... at first I thought that the brush will be rotating but it doesnt I was diappointed at first cause i thought it wont be doing the job properly... I have frizzy hair... but when I used this product for the first time i was really impressed...&lt;br /&gt;The brush is perfect for my hair length and does the job fast and quick and I am now enjoying a neat hair everyday in just 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend everyone give this a try&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent seller and fast shipping :)</li>
    <li> I love this product and recommend it.  I have very thick hair and not using both a brush and dryer is easier and it works very well.  Great gift for someone</li>
    <li> I really like this air brush.  It dries my hair while styling, and does a good job of styling.  If they made one with a smaller roller, I would like to see what the results would be on my hair. It also is easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I am quite impressed by this product, having used a Conair hot air brush for several years. The John Frieda brush really grips your hair without tangling it or creating creases in it. I am surprised by all the volume it creates. The swivel cord makes it so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love it! It is easy to use and works well. Takes less time to do my hair and I think it is better for my fine hair than a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I read previous reviews and decided to take my chances - boy am I glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;Remember to old brushes?  They would catch your hair and were impossible to detangle?  Not this one!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use; doesn&#x27;t get caught up in my hair; and has a great drying capability.  I&#x27;m really pleased and use the brush daily.&lt;br /&gt;I get just enough curl to make my hair interesting but not \\&quot;over the top\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews are right about the on/off/temp control...it is a bit awkward, but certainly not worth worrying about.  You can work around the sensitivity issue.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hesitating....don&#x27;t.  Buy It!</li>
    <li> No different than using your brush and dryer.  I expected a rotating brush and easy use.  Instead its not as described.  Sorry I ordered and cannot return.</li>
    <li> I have longer hair, and for me, it just didn&#x27;t work well. Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it right, but I think I do.  I think it would probably work for someone with shorter hair.</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful product.  Due to illness and many medicines my already thin fine hair looked even less until I used this Frieda Hot Air Brush.  I have had the fuzzies and this has taken care of them-I used to have to dry my hair and then put in hot rollers and hope for the best.  With this item my hair is fuzz free and I can actually walk out the door without the whole roller routine and it feels like its much better for my hair also.  I can actually take this to the hospital when I need to be hospitalized for treatment and my hair looks wonderful.</li>
    <li> The switch on this hot air brush is very hard to use. It is too flat with the handle. Could have been a good thing.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair.  I found the Hot Air Brush easy to use, and it left my hair soft and shiny.... but the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; part was the problem.  When I was finished it had absolutely no body.  Healthy shine, but all limp.  I am sure it would work better for others with more/thicker hair, but a disappointment for me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t tame frizz like I had hoped.  The reviews were so great, but I wish I could just use this and not a curling iron as well.</li>
    <li> Love this Hot Air brush. use it every other day and I usually use my blow dryer for a few minutes . them use this Hot Air brush to help smooth and control my lots of body hair.</li>
    <li> I recently went to Europe and stupidly used a Conair hot air brush that I&#x27;d had for about 8 years that worked wonders on my flat, pin straight hair. My beloved brush burnt out because of my idiocy, so that is when I began my search for a new brush. After much consideration, and reading all the rave reviews for the John Frieda Hot Air Brush, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a lot of fine hair, I don&#x27;t get much volume, body or bounce naturally. This brush does very little to help it. The bristles don&#x27;t grab the hair to give it a nice curl at the end, and you really have to work the same bunch of hair continuously (much longer than I feel is normal) to get any sort of shape. On top of that, there is NOTHING to hold onto at the end so my fingers are constantly getting burned. As if that weren&#x27;t enough, the handle is very large so it&#x27;s quite awkward and difficult to get a comfortable grip. At $30 plus I think this product is over priced for it&#x27;s performance. I don&#x27;t even mind the wattage...I usually mostly dry my hair any ways, but I think I&#x27;ll be looking for a better replacement soon.</li>
    <li> I got this hair dryer and brush combo . It definitely makes the hair less frizzy and more manageable. Hopefully it will last me for a few years.</li>
    <li> there are some fairly intelligent people that cannot manage to dry their hair with a round brush. My stylist has shown me how a million times, yet I lack the manual dexterity to be able to do this without making my thick hair look frizzy and gross. I read about this brush in Allure magazine, and decided to give it a try. I am so happy that I did. I  have used it several times now, and it is awesome. it comes with a low, high, and cool setting, and dried my hair quickly and without frizz. I&#x27;m actually getting one for my mom too (the lack of dexterity is apparently genetic).</li>
    <li> I never have been able to use a brush and the blow dryer at the same time - so this solved that problem perfectly.  Wish I had discovered it a long time ago - makes taking of my hair so much easier.</li>
    <li> Does not blow air enough to dry my hair, let alone curl it.  What a waste of money.....don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Got this to hopefully get my somewhat wavy hair straight.  It just works so so.  Would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Received my &#x27;John Frieda Hot Air Brush&#x27; today and used it this morning. I had seen a review of it on YouTube from  &#x27;Hot and Flashy&#x27; .  The reviewer  convinced  me to go buy it, and happy I did!  I have shoulder length hair and no problem styling looks smooth and bouncy. Will use this everyday! T he package arrived fast and packaging was nice.</li>
    <li> I WISH I GOT THIS SOONER!!! It&#x27;s perfect in every way. It&#x27;s Definately the best on the market, hands downnn! My hair was super soft and bouncy after I used it. However, before exposing your hair to heat, please spray your favorite hair repair oil and heat protectant...and now for the juciy bit;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- Very light weight for it&#x27;s size&lt;br /&gt;- Drys hair fast&lt;br /&gt;- Does not overheat&lt;br /&gt;- Soft brush that leaves your hair soft&lt;br /&gt;- Long cord&lt;br /&gt;- Good quality (Hard/sturdy)..mine fell off my desk and didn&#x27;t break!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br /&gt;-Take a few mins to really heat up&lt;br /&gt;- Careful not to swing it too hard or the filter at the back might fall off&lt;br /&gt;THIS HAIR TOOL IS A MUST HAVE, YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT :-) &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Kind of works if you have really thin hair.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I decided to try this and provide my own opinion about this product. Being a former hair dresser myself, I&#x27;ve always known that regular blow dryers are very harmful for your hair. Hence I have been considering buying a salon chair dryer to sit under while I dried my hair after setting them up in rollers. That&#x27;s because those expel very low energy hot hair that slowly dry the hair without damaging. After reading some negative reviews about the low wattage, I thought this would be more beneficial rather than a negative. And sure enough, it does! In fact, I have been able to dry my hair right out of the shower within 10 mins. I&#x27;m not sure why everyone sees the low energy drying as a negative, when high energy is clearly bad for your hair. Plus this dryer does not tangle up my hair while drying, and leaves it soft and shiny after. I have fine hair, but a lot of them. So my experience has been great with this product. The size of the brush is as large as my rollers, so it works perfectly to add a bit of volume to my hair while allowing it to become curvy-straight. I think this is a wonderful dryer brush and now I can put my straightening iron (which was equally as damaging to my hair) away for good! :) Thank you John Frieda.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like this hot air brush because 500 watts didn&#x27;t seem like enough heat.  For years I used similar products with 1200 watts.  But, I was tired of burning my ears and fingers so I decided to give this one a try.  To my surprise, I really like it.  The lower heat (I use the high setting) leaves my hair very smooth and healthier looking instead of dried out and frizzy.  The only negative is it doesnt have an extended tip to hold on to with the opposite hand, while rolling through my hair.  The tip is flat and I&#x27;m not very good doing it one-handed. I like it enough to keep it and work on perfecting my single handed technique.</li>
    <li> This works so well!  Easy to maneuver and control and my hair stays styled all day...for once!  Awesome product :D</li>
    <li> Not too bad for the price. I just wish it would make my hair dry faster. But overall it works good if ur hair is dry. Plus it combs ok your hair nicely</li>
    <li> I have tried many blow dryers and hair stylist dryers and none of them compare to John Frieda hot air brush! I have very fine and unmanageable hair. This hot hair brush is light weight so my arms or hands don&#x27;t get tired. It definitely adds volume to my hair making it look thicker.  I ended up buying two more as a back up for years to come in the event that this hair dryer should ever die. I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking to add volume to your hair!!</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer and hair curler.  It has soft bristles so my hair does not get tangled.  The heat settings are just right.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it.  Does well, hair cannot be dripping wet when used, but does a spiffy Kubrick when I cannot do a full blowout with a round brush and separate dryer.</li>
    <li> This is nice and light.  I have medium length fine curly hair and this smooths and straightens with added body in about 6 to 8 minutes with towel dried hair.  I recomend a heat protectant spray to use before.  It didnt pull my hair out and is very gentle having a high, low and cool setting.  Not a bad price either.</li>
    <li> Great idea, but the brush is too wide for anything but long hair.  I still use it, but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift a few weeks ago and love how easy it is to use.  I have long, fine hair and I have a natural wave to my hair that I don&#x27;t like so I try to straighten it.  This brush works very well, my only complaint is that my normally soft hair isn&#x27;t soft after using this brush.  My husband noticed that my hair felt different too.  My hair feels very dry and rough after using it.  Anyone else having this issue?</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this hot air brush! I have color treated,very curly coarse shoulder length hair.I usually just leave it curly,as it is almost impossible to straighten.....I usually leave that job to my hairstylist. I had nothing to lose when I purchased this dryer.....I washed,towel dried, let air dry for about 15-20 min. then sectioned my hair and went to drying. Took me all of 20 minutes start to finish and my hair is soft,lots of body,and STRAIGHT!! Sometimes i flip the bottom up,sometimes under...always works well and lasts for 2-3 days. NO FRIZZ!!!!!! I am in love with this brush and i highly recommend it to anyone at their wits end with their hair.</li>
    <li> I  agree with other comments. Brush to large, not enough blow power. Takes long when hair is too wet. Handle also a bit large for my hand.</li>
    <li> The commercials for these types of products are always so inticing. Get great volume and bounce with one item. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. I find it much easier and better to get volume and body using just a regular large, round brush and hairdryer. I quickly returned this.</li>
    <li> I have hair that does not hold a style at all. I found this helps with giving my hair a lift that it so desperately needs. I also bought the spray that was recommended to purchase with it. I highly recommend that purchase, too. It helps your hair from getting too dried out while drying.</li>
    <li> great product saves time to do hairstyle I can complete a hairdo in about 15 minutes in comparison to twenty</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. I have short fine hair and I couldn&#x27;t get it work properly. I gave it to my daughter who has fine long hair and she also could not get it to work. The brush would not hold the fine hair. It kept slipping off the roller. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. I hope it works for thick short or long hair.</li>
    <li> Love it &amp; use it daily whether I wash my hair or not. It creates lots of volume &amp; have pretty much given up using my curling iron.</li>
    <li> just like above.....really liked it but flet like it was not quite hot enough.  ended up using my hair dryer while i was using it.  sort of comical.</li>
    <li> I have long fairly straight asian hair that is thick and coarse.  I used this brush on my damp hair, and it was effective producing that &amp;#34;round brush blow out&amp;#34; effect in a fairly short time.  There are several settings, including a cool setting, and while it&#x27;s hot, it&#x27;s not burning or singeing--I don&#x27;t think the heat is damaging like an iron; the brush handle and the far end of it stay cool and easy to touch.  The power cord swivels, so there is no twisting or tangling as you are twirling the brush around.  It is lightweight and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because for some reason, I had the impression that the brush had a &amp;#34;spinning&amp;#34; function.  I realize now that it does not say that it spins or rotates anywhere on the package, but when I originally was searching Amazon.com, i had put &amp;#34;spinning brush&amp;#34; in the search box, and this came up, so maybe that&#x27;s where I came up with that notion.  A hot brush with a spinning option would be a plus for me, since that rotating action is so crucial to the styling and is something that is just difficult for me to do manually.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing.  Some had to dry their hair with a blow dryer THEN use the hot air brush to finish drying/styling.  I thought that since my hair is short and fine, it would work with my hair, without having to pre-dry.  I thought wrong.  Took forever to get it dry and styled.  If they could have just put more power into it, it would have been perfect.  Now, just a pain to use with an extra step thrown in.</li>
    <li> It is lighter weight than others I have used which is a huge plus. Does a wonderful job smoothing my curly hair. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Am still giving it a try but until learning curve is done, it is easier to grab the hairbrush and hairdryer.  Might have more to do with my skills.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and love it. When my hair was past my shoulders I didn&#x27;t like it much but when I cut my hair and tried it again it is great. It doesn&#x27;t dry your hair but it styles it under or flips it up. It also gives shine and body.</li>
    <li> I like this, but your hair has to be mostly dry to use it so it is not a time saver if that is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like it....not much hot air, takes an extremely long time to dry hair, have to dry hair first until almost dry then use.</li>
    <li> Really like this for my limpy hair.</li>
    <li> This works great. I am not the kind of girl that can do the brush and the blower (nor do I have the time for that), but this is an all in one device and works great for shoulder length THICK hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with my new salon shaper hot air brush!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been blow drying my hair since my hands were big enough to hold a blow dryer, I have curly unruly hair. I&#x27;ve fought frizz and tired hands for years! I&#x27;m almost 50 now and have FINALLY found a dream come true! Right off the bat, first time I used it my hair was smooth and so pretty! I showed my family and they couldn&#x27;t believe how pretty it looked in half the time it always took to blowdry. I Thank you John Freida!!!!</li>
    <li> I found this hot air brush by accident while browsing Amazon.  It came in a couple of weeks ago and apparently I wasn&#x27;t that excited about it because I just opened it tonight!!!  So glad I did!  I really never take the time to write reviews, but I just had to with this item.  First let me just say, no hair care product will ever make 100% of the buyers happy.  I will just tell you about my experience.  I am 44 and have shoulder length brown hair that is on the thinning side.  So no, it&#x27;s not like Rapunzel&#x27;s hair or like the commercials you see for hair color...lol.  I am constantly trying to duplicate the gorgeous styling of my stylist, either by trying to duplicate her blow dry/straightening technique or purchasing every product I&#x27;ve seen her use in my hair (shampoo, mousse, gel, round brush).  It never comes out as nice.  So tonight, for the first time, my hair had dried pretty much 75% naturally and I thought, \\&quot;dang, I need to open my John Frieda Hot Air Brush\\&quot;.  Don&#x27;t ask me why it took so long....guess I&#x27;m really busy.  I put a little mousse in my hair and started running the brush through my hair...random sections at a time....no real method to my madness.  Waaaala!  There was such a nice bouncy wave, yet straight and soft style when I finished!  I wasn&#x27;t even really trying.  It looked the way it does when my stylist puts a wave in my hair with her straightener.  I&#x27;m trying to do less of the full blow dry, then hot flat iron tool and give my hair a break.  This will do the trick!  I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money over the years and this product is a great buy.  Yeah, I&#x27;ve only used it once, but that&#x27;s all I needed to convince myself.  It was a really nice surprise!  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure it out but it isn&#x27;t &#x27;all that&#x27; for me.  I have fine hair.  The &#x27;stem&#x27; is very hard to hold...and I have big hands.  It controls OK but not as &#x27;wonderful&#x27; as I had hope.  It works &#x27;fine&#x27;.  I hope them eventually do a better design for holding and working with the unit.</li>
    <li> I like this air brush a lot and have tried several others that were not as good.  It just doesn&#x27;t give me as much curl as I would like, but would work very well for straighter hair.</li>
    <li> I was easy to use but just didn&#x27;t work for my hair to obtain body.  My hair is hard to style anyway.  It&#x27;s fine, thin and straight and lacks body.  My hair does better with just a hair dryer, round brush and curl iron.  Probably works for people who have body in their hair anyway.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair so when I blow it out straight it requires a lot of work. I use the John Frieda Air Brush for styling once my hair is 95% dry. It allows me to get close to the root for optimal volume without torching my skalp. It&#x27;s also great for second day maintenance for keeping your blow out looking fresh. Since I started using it people have been asking me if I got my hair professionally blown out!</li>
    <li> I purcahse this product for my self, after the gym with wet hair it Works perfectly, i had read that the top part can be broken with to me it Works perfectly!!! recommendeeed!</li>
    <li> This brush is a great idea, but it doesn&#x27;t give off enough air/heat to be effective. I have to blow dry my hair 90% of the way, then pull this thing out -- which defeats the purpose of having a 2 in 1!</li>
    <li> This is the best tool I&#x27;ve ever bought for my extremely wavy hair.  my hair is short/medium length with the back being very wavy and almost curly and this tool helps me shape and pull it straighter than even a flat iron.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love how their hair looks when they step out of a salon?  Like most people, I can never achive the same look on my own, so started looking up tips to try. I found the John Frieda Hot Air Brush online after doing a Google search. My Mother used to own something back in the day like this, but it had super hard bristles that would often tangle the hair. The reviews were great on this so I figured I would give it a try. What I do is dry my hair with the hair dryer till it is about 80% dry. Then I use the hot air brush to style, and the results are awesome! The first day I used this, I had 2 people ask if I had my hair blown out. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This product rocks my socks off! I have very fine, but thick  and wavy hair. It can get very frizzy! I used to use a round brush, a blow dryer, and then a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I air dry a while and use this. It leaves my hair smooth and frizz free with just the right amount of bounce.&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten tons of compliments, since using this.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a super hot or powerful dryer, so you do need to air dry a bit, but it has left my hair feeling so much healthier!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! So glad my hairdresser recommended it. Much easier to use then a brush and hair dryer for styling.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and really wanted to love this. I have thick, long, fine hair. I have to blow-dry or it is a frizzy mess. My arms hurt from holding the blow dryer and a round brush to get that &amp;#34;blowout&amp;#34; look. I figured this might be a two-in-one product that would work for me. I used my hairdryer until my hair was about 85-90% dry and then used this. It doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair at all. It does give a smooth effect. It just doesn&#x27;t dry fast enough for me. If you have very thick hair, this is just going to take forever to get your hair dry. I used it for 30 minutes *after* I used my regular hairdryer to get my hair almost dry. And I still had a damp spot in back of the head---damp hair&#x3D;frizz. Back to the drawing board for me.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but it is not at all powerful. Does not seem to get hot enough or blow enough air and really only works if your hair is mostly dry already. I&#x27;ve had others like this that I liked much better and this one was very disappointing</li>
    <li> I use this to style my extremely curly hair straight, and it&#x27;s a miracle. I wait until my hair is 90% dry, then use this tool to smooth each layer out and finish drying. It&#x27;s easy and my hair looks awesome.</li>
    <li> Best &#x27;hair dryer&#x27; I&#x27;ve purchased.  Works for thin or thick hair, helps give the hair a bit more body.  If this ever gets discontinued, I&#x27;m buying 3 more.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m never coordinated enough (or patient enough!) to use a round brush in one hand and a hair dryer in the other. This is perfect. I dry my hair most of the way with a regular hair dryer, then use the Salon Shape to smooth and style. Perfect every time!</li>
    <li> This works great and is much less damaging than flatirons. It also styles very quickly. I highly recommend it!  Five stars for sure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than I thought it would be. It curls my medium/long hair nicely without pulling my hair out.</li>
    <li> Great item. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it had such great reviews. I tried it on damp hair and it took AGES to dry my hair. Forget about styling or getting volume. I do have somewhat thick hair but its never been a problem with my dryer and round brush. This thing simply couldn&#x27;t get the job done. I only had the patience to style my hair with this 2-3 times and my hair went flat about 10 minutes later.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit skeptical of this product. However, I am growing my hair out, and was in desparate need of something that could get me thru the boredom, without cutting it all off. I needed something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I really like this product.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5th star is because it doesn&#x27;t blow very hard. I had no trouble with it getting hot, although I do get frustrated with the heat setting button, as it sometimes gets accidentally changed to cool if I hold it the wrong way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am blessed/cursed with very think hair, so it would take FOREVER  to completely dry my hair with this product. I took the advice of one of the reveiwers and used a traditional hair dryer until my hair was 80% dry. It worked great for stying from that point on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This products gives my very heavy hair lots of body and height, more than a traditional hair dryer. Bouncy curls, height at the roots, and smooth body. it&#x27;s pretty easy to use, too.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars</li>
    <li> Love this product, just wish the sliding control was easier to read.  I have already suggested to three people that they buy this product.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED 2 OF THESE, AS MY DAUGHTER AND I HAVE NATURAL CURLEY HAIR, AND OTHER DRYERS ARE HARDER TO USE. THIS IS PERFECT AND IT DRIES THE HAIR QUICKLY. HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Very good!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this shaper. Glides through wet or dry hair without tangling.</li>
    <li> The best hot air brush EVER! Can&#x27;t go wrong with this :)</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the air brush. I&#x27;m not a person who likes to spend much time fixing her hair in the morning and the John Frieda gets the job done. I have shoulder length hair. The only thing I would change is that you can&#x27;t detach the brush section from the wand. Being able to do so is helpful for packing.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to replicate the blow-outs that my stylist does until getting this handy tool. My favorite thing about it is that it eliminates the need to have both hands working to straighten my hair. It does an excellent job of adding bounce to my very thick hair, which is tough to do with just a flat-iron. I also like that the barrel doesn&#x27;t get too hot--no burnt fingers. One last thing: it is relatively quiet, which is a nice change from most styling tools.</li>
    <li> I do not leave product reviews very often, but this one I absolutely HAD to. With European hair in humid Florida I have always struggled to find the right tools/products for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I received this brush I was at first a little disappointed because the brush part did not rotate. However, I realized that a builtin rotation would not make this product any more brilliant than it already is!&lt;br /&gt;After the shower I either leave my hair air drying or I briefly use my blow drier so that my hair is not dripping wet when using the round brush. What usually would take me a good 45 minutes with a normal blow dryer/round brush, I am able to accomplish in under 10 minutes. Being a mom, time is everything! But just because I am a mother does not mean that I want to spend 7 days a week with the pony tail mom do. This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> if u are looking for something to straighten or if u have thick, long hair or curly or all of the above would not buy this at all. but since i&#x27;ve chopped off my hair it works great with my bob. lots of volume and no frizz and cuts down getting ready time</li>
    <li> so happy with this product, it arrived before arrival day and it works great.  Glad I bought it. would even buy one for friends and family</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! I have one and I like it! I&#x27;m ordered third times as a present to my friend. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Its great but makes my hair static.&lt;br /&gt;So i don&#x27;t use it as much.  I am not sure if its just my hair.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s okay, but doesn&#x27;t curl my very thick hair. But helps with frizz control.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  I just used it for the first time.  And for the first time, I was actually able to blow dry my hair and have it come out without frizz and fly away and hair at odd angles and too much volume.  The barrel size was the right size to allow me to dry all the way to my scalp and all the way down to the ends and style my hair as well. It is incredible how much control one has with this device.  And it did not require looking in the mirror the whole time because it was so easy.  I mostly watched videos with closed caption on and checked the mirror once in a while.  The results are excellent.  And it was unbelievably easy.</li>
    <li> First time I don&#x27;t have frizzies....best purchase I have made in a long time. You want regret trying this.&lt;br /&gt;Go for it</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in place of hair dryer and round brush. But basically you have to have your hair 95% dry or it doesn&#x27;t work.  But it works great at a styler.  Would be better if there something on the end to hold on to</li>
    <li> I needed a good brush and am very happy with this one. It&#x27;s quite and has a cool setting, to set the curl.</li>
    <li> Fair quality. My biggest complaint is the end gets very hot, so its difficult to style my hair w/o burning the tips of my fingers. It works pretty well and is easier than using a hair dryer and round brush. Will go with a different brand when this one gets old enough to retire.</li>
    <li> I used to straighten my hair a lot before I got this Hot Air Brush and it was very damaging to my hair and it did not have the &#x27;bounce&#x27; I was looking for. The Hot Air Brush is a lot less damaging and my hair looks great! It has a fresh look to it. I got several compliments and a couple of people thought I had gone to the salon to get my hair done. The Air Brush is very light to carry, which is a plus. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This air brush is easy to use.  I found it does more straightening with long hair than providing volume.  It has good power and heat but the heat/power button is a bad design.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t overheat.  If you have small hands it can be harder to hold onto. I like the size of the brush as it doesn&#x27;t make hair too curly.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. My hair is getting thin and, I am able to achieve volume with tis brush. I actually purchased 2 more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I received the air brush quickly.  I have used it a few times and so far I really love it.  The barrel (1.5 inch) is larger than I expected, but it works well on my fine hair.  It runs quietly and I like that it has a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting.</li>
    <li> The hot air brush is easy to use.  It leaves one hand free to help style.  I thought it might help in drying my hair straight&#x27; it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked the brush to detach so that I could wash it.</li>
    <li> I really like this hot brush, It tames the frizzies and dries my hair without have to use a hot iron which I consider damages the hair when used excessively.</li>
    <li> No frizz, no breakage, not too hot but dries my hair quickly, SO much better than a hair dryer and brush.</li>
    <li> Great styling tool--I use it to smooth my hair and get rid of frizz.  However, I wish it came with tips on how to use, and with a bigger barrel.</li>
    <li> Not hot enough to hold the curls. Need seperate place for cold button. Brush has great grip on hair. If hot air blow hotter it should do better job.</li>
    <li> Was so excited to see this product listed - too bad it just comes in this gigantic size!  I am really disappointed.  i was really looking forward to using this product....</li>
    <li> my wife got this product and it cut the time it takes her to get ready for work in half</li>
    <li> I think it is very convenient to use, unlike the flat irons, you can apply it on the wet hairs.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, natural curly hair and need a hot air brush when/if I wear my hair down. Even utilizing a blow drier to almost completely dry before using the John Frieda, it does not work for me. Disappointing as the search continues for a better product. I am currently using a Revlon model but they are cheap and burn out within months.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair which tends to tangle easily.  I thought I would try this for volume, but it ends up giving me fly-aways and doesn&#x27;t smooth my hair as much as I would have liked.  Probably going to give it to a friend.</li>
    <li> The large round handle makes it easy to use with arthritic hands. The heat settings work perfectly fine. The hot is hot enough to straighten curly hair and leave a loose flip either over or under. The warm setting works just as well for touching up my fine hair and I don&#x27;t use the cool setting. Yes, the ssettings are on the upper part of the handle and I&#x27;ve accidentally turned on the cool setting briefly, once or twice, but not really a big deal for me.</li>
    <li> This tool has taken all of the frustration out of styling my hair.  I could never master holding the hair dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other, and this removes that problem.  It does seem to cause some extra breakage, but not much more than other heat styling.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft and dont get tangled too often. The thing doesn&#x27;t dry the hair super well, but its great for styling. I use it after blasting my hair with a normal dryer to get at the roots a bit first.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I recommend it</li>
    <li> Works like it is supposed to!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and when I got mine I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I styled my dry hair and I love it. I got this to use after a run. Your hair is kind of moist from the run and this will quickly bring it back without having to wash your hair.  Agree with others that it get rid of frizz hair. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I like this thing! I am wondering if there are replacement heads because the bristles are kind of bending. But overall a great purchase for someone who has a hard time doing a blowout on their own with a brush and dryer!</li>
    <li> Nice Brush. Does not snag or pull.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet, which I appreciate early In the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair shiny and styled.</li>
    <li> The Best purchase for curly hair or fizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other products to straighten my curls.  I use it on my hair after I let it air dry.  It is so easy.  Very happy with product.  I have thin hair</li>
    <li> Comfortable hand grip, strong, and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I was using a circular brush and hairdryer to style my chin-length, baby-fine hair. It got complicated when I tried to do the back of my head. I read a ton of reviews on hot air brushes, and chose this one. So often I buy things with high hopes, but end up being disappointed in some way. Not so with this device - I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and it has been absolutely ideal.  It is much easier to use than the hairbrush/hairdryer combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying, I noted that some users found the high-temp setting to be quite hot, and this is true. However, the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting, which is the next slide up on the control switch from the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting, helps moderate the temperature, and it&#x27;s easy to slide back and forth.  Moreover, it&#x27;s nowhere near as hot as my curling iron, which baked my fine hair and burned my skin. The curling iron has been retired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair stays fairly well-shaped all day, even in the high humidity we have here in Florida.</li>
    <li> It does not dry my hair.  A hand held dryer and brush are better and faster on my short hair.</li>
    <li> Not enough power to blow dry your hair,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be smaller brush size would have helped,,,,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also dual voltage would have been great .</li>
    <li> Brush is large and handle a bit unwieldy.  It does the job well, however but does take some getting used to.  I will order the smaller brush.</li>
    <li> suits my needs.  I&#x27;m not much for fooling with hair.  this gets the job done quickly.  helps with frizz.without other products needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the John Frieda Hot Air Brush three times now, and I&#x27;ve been happy every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box I thought, oh gosh, this brush is so BIG, how&#x27;s that going to work? I have thick, wavy, chin-length hair, and I could definitely see this working for someone with long hair. But it turns out that it works fine on medium-length hair, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have time, I let my hair air-dry until damp, then use this for styling. If I don&#x27;t have time, I partially dry my hair with a blowdryer, then use this for styling. I used to use a straightening iron to get the top layers sleek, but I much prefer this, as I&#x27;m able to brush and dry all the layers of my hair, not just the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibbles: the cool setting blows just as hard as the high/hot setting. Seems it should be low cool, not high cool. A few bristles fell out the first couple times I used it, but that seems to have stopped now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is plenty long enough. The price is right. If you are trying to tame thick, wavy hair, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, LOVE THIS. Leaves your hair feeling soft and full of body</li>
    <li> My hair is very long; I blow dry with one dryer to &amp;#34;almost dry&amp;#34; - then use the air brush to softens my hair and make it shine.</li>
    <li> How did I ever live without this before?  My hair is shinier and silkier and I don&#x27;t have to use the straightener as much since this tames my hair.</li>
    <li> I am more than pleased with this hot air brush.  It saves a lot of styling time.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading RAVE reviews about it on my favorite beauty blog. Now I have only had it for two weeks, so give me some time. But I&#x27;m not really sure if this product is really adding anything to my life. I&#x27;ve tried to use it to dry my hair - which doesn&#x27;t work because I have thick, thick hair. And I&#x27;ve used it with a blow dryer, which makes me feel stupid. I&#x27;m going to keep trying and will report back, but as of right now - go buy an olivia garden brush, I get way better results!</li>
    <li> I loved the way my hair looked with the 1.5 inch brush. My hair is past my shoulders and in long layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does get hot and I might have saw some steam coming from my slightly damp hair. Also if you switch to cool setting it takes at least a min to cool because it was so hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, its a great tool.</li>
    <li> The diameter of the brush is too large for my hair, it left it flat instead of having some curl. I straighten my&lt;br /&gt;natural curly hair, but still want some curl. I know that seems contrary to what I am trying to accomplish...but I like a bit of a bounce.........not the flat look. Otherwise it does a nice job.</li>
    <li> I wanted to skip a step in the morning and have a brush and blowdryer in one. this does not do that, it is too weak to dry your hair, so it adds a step, so I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Has almost been 2 years and still work fine. I have thin/fine hair so it actually works fine, but it may not be powerful enough for some people.</li>
    <li> great product, use it alot</li>
    <li> I love this heated brush. I have never been able to successfully brush style my hair. This has been the answer for me. I highly recommend it for smoothing fine hair and adding volume.</li>
    <li> Awesome styling tool. Now my hair looks like I just left the salon when I use it at home.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my naturally curly hair that struggled staying straight without my stylist blowing every strand of hair (and I have a lot of hair!). This gift made my day and my husband is impressed that it sustains even through our hikes!</li>
    <li> This is now the only drying/styling tool I use. No more hairdryer, no more straightener. It makes my hair shiny, full of body and shape, and easy to manage. I let my hair air dry about half way and style the rest with this. You can just brush it through to dry quickly, or take sections and roll them into the brush to achieve voluminous curl. It&#x27;s also great to travel - no need to pack a brush, dryer, and straightener! All you need is this!</li>
    <li> perfect size for traveling. I have several of these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn on this product. Is it really necessary? You could just blow dry your hair and then use your 1.5&amp;#34; curling iron for better results. It seems to make my hair frizzy, but maybe it&#x27;s the dry weather right now. Cool shot is a great feature as it does hold curl better when I use that feature. I like this since it&#x27;s different and makes curling a little fun and different, just not sure it&#x27;s needed. Also, takes quite a bit of time to use even if you do blow dry most moisture out first.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. Looked at reviews on several hot air brushes &amp; I decided on the John Frieda Hot Air Brush. After using it for the first time, I knew I had made the right decision. No problems after continual use. I air dry my shoulder length hair for a few minutes, then use the hot air brush. Had issues with friz using regular hair dryer. This product is a delight and has cut down on time spent after shampooing. Hair style lasts longer too!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! This adds so much body, shine, and bounce. My hair is fine but doesn&#x27;t get stuck or tangled in the brush. I wish it had more wattage however! I dry it most of the way with the regular blow dryer before going to this. I&#x27;ve eliminated needed the straight iron to smooth it out. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about buying this because I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products but nothing works for my hair type. The day I received this in the mail I tried it out and fell in love instantly. I&#x27;m mixed with Dominican and Guatemalan so my hair type is very curly and unruly so its a pain to blow dry it and this makes it so easy. I hate using a flat iron because it damages my curly locks and blow drying just dries it out to much and this does neither. A MUST BUY!!!!!</li>
    <li> I decided to order this because I am extremely bad at styling my hair. I&#x27;m proud that I can atleast straighten my hair. I saw this product in a magazine and thought I would give it a try. I read the other reviews and saw that a lot of people were saying that it wasn&#x27;t very powerful at only 500 watts. I was a bit worried since I have thin hair but A LOT of it but I thought I would give it a try. When I finally tried it and it took a long time. My hair was pretty once it was done but I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the time. Next time I am going to try it when my hair is more dry so it can be done faster. I like this product but I don&#x27;t love it. I would recommend this for people who have thin hair and not too much of it or people who don&#x27;t mind taking a bit more time on their hair. I did like how this product made my hair have more volume! I do wish it was more powerful.</li>
    <li> I just discovered this product the other day, and I am SO happy that I did! I saw all of the great reviews and decided that I had to give it a try (especially since it&#x27;s not that expensive as styling tools go). I have shoulder length, fine hair and I live on Long Island which means I have to deal with humidity induced frizziness for about 80% of the year. My normal routine is to blow-dry my hair with a round brush (which I am not very adept at) until I give up and decide it&#x27;s good enough and then flat iron the heck out of it until it looks decedent. Frequently in the summer, I just put my hair up in a ponytail because I can&#x27;t deal with the whole trying-to-get-my-hair-to-look-presentable routine. Then I used this product...and everything is about to change. I let my hair air dry for a bit and then used this hot air brush on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting. Amazing!!! SO easy to use. Just basically like brushing my hair, but with slower, smoother motions. I didn&#x27;t even try that hard to make it look good, and it still came out as well as (or better) than it would usually look after I flat iron. If you have fine hair, I would say that this product is a no-brainer. I can&#x27;t really speak to the longevity or durability of this product as I just received it, but it seems sturdy and I can tell that it is going quickly become my essential hair tool. I really recommend giving this product a go!</li>
    <li> It works on all levels:  dry &amp; style without excessive,damaging heat.  For travel it&#x27;s ideal.  Only need to pack one device that does it all.</li>
    <li> Love this styler! This is not as fast of a drying product as a hair dryer, so hair should be almost dry or damp if you want to save time. I have fairly long, thick hair and my hair looks as soft and smooth as it does when I leave the salon. It&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
    <li> I have no fewer than 3 hairbrush hairdryers and this one is by far, the best. The bristles are such that they do not tangle my fine hair. Previously, I would dry my hair and then run my ceramic curling iron through it to make it smoother. That step is no longer required since using this hot air brush. The finish is smooth. I typically use it for the first minute or so on high, then move down to the lower setting so I don&#x27;t damage my hair. The cool setting is a bonus that works well for setting the curl.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hairdryer and the bristles are hard enough to catch my hair but not scratch my head as some do.  Not sure if the bristles would be stiff enough to catch coarser hair, mine is very fine.  But it doesn&#x27;t get very hot so it doesn&#x27;t add much curl to my hair.  Think one with a metal core would work better to actually curl my hair. I had purchased one previously but it overheated so I thought this might work better.  I&#x27;ll be keeping it but using it more as a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  If I could change anything, I&#x27;d make the handle a smaller diameter (for my small hands.)  It works great and frees up one hand as compared to using a dryer and a brush.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This air brush is perfect for styling my hair.  The bristles are gentle, but are still firm enough to work with hair.  It dries your hair thoroughly.  I don&#x27;t even use my hair dryer anymore.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and was looking for something to help me style my hair easily and casually. It does produce much better results than when I completely dry my hair with a regular ionic dryer and hair brush. I follow the suggestions and dry my hair about 50%, then I use the John Frieda Salon Shape to style and finish drying. It also is good for re-freshing my hair after sleeping on it. A few minutes, and hair is back in shape with frizzies tamed.</li>
    <li> Pleased with the performance</li>
    <li> works really good. It only takes about ten minutes to do my short hair with this wonderful tool.</li>
    <li> Jury still out on this product.wife bought.she seems to be so so with it. She has not raved about it.will update later.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this device.  I had the Vidal Sassoon which was great until I burned it out.  I replaced it with the Conair which I hated (too bulky and heavy, not agile).  I hesitated to try again but this one is perfect!  I love the cool setting.  I simply do not have time to mess with my hair much in the morning and this makes me look polished in under 5 minutes.  Me...polished.  That is a pretty big feat.  I have med length fine hair that can be fluffy and dry with weird waves in it on its own.  This is the solution!</li>
    <li> I have never written a product review before today.  I&#x27;m a shopper and my friends call me the return queen.  If I&#x27;m unhappy with something I have no problem returning anything.  I actually saved the shipping box for this because I was not sure I believed all of the great reviews this product had.  I thought for sure it would be returned.  After using it today for the first time, I have to say I LOVE IT!  I have straight short to med length hair which requires heat to style it even after a good blow out.  I&#x27;m 54 years old and I have to say, I followed the types to dry my hair 80 to 90% (air dried this morning).  I then sectioned it and was able to wrap the hair tightly to around the brush with no problem.  I let the hair get hot and then moved to the cool setting for about 20 seconds and perfect!  My ends looked perfect and I had a lot of silky body.  My friend was so impressed when I showed her today that she is going to buy one as well.  I just love this and look forward to washing and styling my hair again!</li>
    <li> I have very thick frizzy hair and was hoping the hot air brush would help dry/curl in and unfrizz my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to hold and manipulate (like rotating it)&lt;br /&gt;* Brush size is not too big nor small&lt;br /&gt;* Works wonders in giving my hair a curl in on the ends and bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;* Only thing that bothered me was that when my finger accidentally slipped into the bristles and hit the metal it burned my finger.  It wasn&#x27;t too bad but it can happen and it will hurt.  It is hard to use my other hand to just assist my main hand while curling in my ends because I have a tendency to try and hold the top end of the brush with finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t do anything about the frizz- actually my hair is less frizzy if i leave it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- I love it!  Even if it doesn&#x27;t help with the frizz, it helps me give my ends a curl in that is easy to do and keep all day.  It beats using a flat iron to straighten the body and give the ends a flip inward.</li>
    <li> My hair is a little too short to use this product effectively.  I gave it to my daughter who has long hair and she loves it.  She also uses it on her 6 yr. old daughter with good results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this thing 2 days but I can already tell that I&#x27;m going to be using it ALL the time.  I love it!  I have straight, relatively thick (but fine) hair that falls about a few inches below my chin and so far it has worked so much better, and easier, than using a blow dryer and a curling brush.  At first, because it does not blow out a lot of air, and because the air did not feel too hot, I was concerned that it was not going to work - but it does.  I don&#x27;t think working with sopping wet hair is best however and so I give my towel-dried hair a quick hit with the regular blow dryer until my hair is little more than slightly damp and then I use this product.  It gives me hair a ton of body and life.  I have subtracted 1 star only because the product feels a little cheaply made and so I&#x27;m wondering out long it will last.  However, considering it doesn&#x27;t cost a thousand dollars I&#x27;m thinking the value is good, even if it only lasts a year or two.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to find an alternative to the hot brushes I have used in the past. So far, I am pleased with this one, though my timing was not good for a new, shorter hairdo. (I have ordered the 1 inch model, which should work even better for now. The 1.5 inch should be perfect for styling a medium bob.) I like the air/heat output and the combination of bristles, which hold the hair a little more securely than plastic ones, but not too much.</li>
    <li> Too little blowing power, even for my fine hair. It would take forever to dry a head of hair.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I very much like it! It works well and is efficient. I think placement of controls could be better planned.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.  Would not recommend</li>
    <li> This not a time saver.  The wattage is simply too low to dry hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this one, I don&#x27;t think the spinning one would be necessary (I could see the spinning brushes causing more tangles).  Just to be clear, this one does not spin. But, I do like the end result.  I just think you need to let your fair dry a bit before using. It does produce a nice result and is likely a bit easier than holding a brush and dryer.  But you still need to section your hair, blow a bit at a time, etc.</li>
    <li> I just love my new John Frieda  Air Brush.  It is so easy to hold and I only have to use  one hand.  Was never great at doing a style but this new air brush makes it so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Thought it was very reasonable and would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this! I am surprised. I am a hair dummy and got this to help me with styling. It did take awhile to get used to, but I am ultimately impressed. I&#x27;ve even shown it to a few friends... They all said &amp;#34;Wow! It&#x27;s amazing how much your hair looks and how quickly that thing styled it!&amp;#34; I still use my regular hair dryer and just have boring straight hair most of the time because this does take longer to use, but it really is the perfect way to add style and volume in a fairly short amount of time</li>
    <li> Works great! Speeds up my blow out in the morning helping me get out the door quicker.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to use at my son&#x27;s wedding. I took it with me before trying it out at home and ended up with terrible looking hair. It was so bad that I had to schedule an appointment with the Hotel&#x27;s Spa to style my hair for the wedding. It ended up costing me twice the price that I should have paid. To add to the bad experience, when I went to return it I was ONE DAY LATE and they would not do anything for me. The only reason that I hadn&#x27;t returned it sooner was because I believed that it did what it was advertised to do. It did not curl my hair or straighten it at all. It wouldn&#x27;t even attach to my hair. The overall experience was awful and now I will think twice before I purchase anything from Amazon again. How very Disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This probably works better with thinner or lighter hair. Mine isn&#x27;t coarse, but on the thicker side.&lt;br /&gt;Could def use some hard bristles mixed in and it&#x27;s pretty under-powered.&lt;br /&gt;Since i only wash my hair every-other day, i&#x27;ll probably just use it to run through my dry hair the days i don&#x27;t wash, for a little lift.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice that the cord is so long.&lt;br /&gt;I used it as i would my round brush this morning at the same time as my regular dryer and that worked ok.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it&#x27;s quite worth the $30 but guess i&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
    <li> With a fractured collarbone I was desperate to find something I could dry my hair with with one hand.  This seemed like a good choice based on some reviews. It should be clearly understood that with the exception of those with VERY thin hair, this is not a hair dryer, it is a hair STYLER.  It would take me hours to actually dry my hair with this even after air towel and air drying my short layered hair. I ended up using my regular dryer first, then using this to manage it and style it which it worked well for.  THEN I had to flat iron it anyway. There is little air flow and little heat.&lt;br /&gt;I guess ill use it until I have fully recovered, it does serve my purpose of not having to use 2 hands to manage my hair, but after that, probably not. It creates cute curl after a while, which made it easier to flat iron, and I probably could have gotten away without using the flat iron, but I sort of looked like an episode of Mad Men, with 60&#x27;s kind of curl, like I had used rollers.</li>
    <li> I use this every day- it&#x27;s not as evil to the hair as my regular hair dryer and i love that it curls the hair for you - it is easier than holding the hair dryer in one hand and the round brush in the other and having your arms ache!</li>
    <li> Thought it was a revolving brush but it&#x27;s not. It doesn&#x27;t straighten hair well at all.</li>
    <li> After reading several good reviews, I decided to give this a try. Its a good price so I thought, &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; Well, it didn&#x27;t give me the blow dryer+ round brush results I get from my hairdresser. Not even close. Its not a bad product, but my hair is very finicky and this was not the solution. I was hoping I could use this and not have to use a chi straightener on my hair anymore, but no such luck. My hair is thick, but fine, and extremely wavy/curly. Most days I just leave it that way, but sometimes I like to straighten it. Guess I&#x27;ll stick with the blow dryer and chi since I have decided to return this. Maybe some of you will have better luck than I!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for about a week and it is perfect for me.  I have medium-long curly hair which is fairly fine.  It has essentially taken the place of my hair dryer! I towel dry and let my hair air dry while getting ready. (But if I&#x27;m in a hurry I quickly blow dry for 2-3 min. until it&#x27;s about 80% dry as recommended).  Then this brush is used for styling/straightening.  It does a much better job than a brush and hairdryer together and most importantly- IT DOES NOT GET STUCK IN MY HAIR! yeah.  This brush straightens and curls my hair way better than a regular round brush and it doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair the way a traditional brush does.  In less than 10 minutes, my hair looks like it was styled in the salon. Would highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of the negative reviews, and I think whether you will like this brush really just depends on your hair type.  I don&#x27;t see this being easy to use with really long and/or thick hair.</li>
    <li> It is a good air brush, but they need to make some improvements.  I almost returned it after I turned it on and was getting cold air instead of hot, until I looked at it under the light to discover that the highest setting is cold, so you have to go down one little notch to set it on heat.  This does not make sense to me, since the hot hair appliances I have own, the higher you go up, the hotter it is.  It just makes sense that any setting starts with cold and goes up to hot.  The other problem is the tip of the brush; IT GETS HOT!  You tend to grab that end automatically to help roll the hair and you get a burning surprise.  Other than that; it performs weil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wondered how hair stylists make it look so easy…  They blow-dry your hair and make it look so amazing!  You think &amp;#34;I can do that!  I have a hair blow-dryer at home, I can buy one of those round brushes!&amp;#34;  Then you get home and find you also needed an extra set of arms.  I&#x27;m not ambidextrous.  In fact, I&#x27;m a little clumsy even with my dominant hand.  But this product takes away the need for extra arms.  It&#x27;s a brush an blow-dryer in one.  I tie part of my hair up and work in sections, applying hair serum when I need it.  My hair has more volume than I&#x27;ve seen in a long time and I can manipulate hair waves or flips as well.  I couldn&#x27;t get this kind of fullness from a hair straightener.  Best two-in-one invention ever!</li>
    <li> I loved this product for the first few months but it started making a horrible noise, cleaned out the end and it worked for a while, but last time it started smoking and sparking, had to throw it away :(</li>
    <li> This air brush does not give my fine, thin hair any body at all.  Buying this was a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Not too bad...but I&#x27;ve had better curls from other brushes. Ok for the price.</li>
    <li> Good air drier and hair styler lol,never regret to buy it!</li>
    <li> Love it. So simple, fast, and effective. I am able to work with the body in my hair rather than just leave it flat to control the frizz.</li>
    <li> It does what it supposed to do and I love it better than using a blow dryer and a brush separately.</li>
    <li> It works well and if it lasts than it could be five stars.  Only time will tell if it gets the fifth star.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if it would really work to help de-frizz my my naturally curly hair and it does! You do have to airdry your hair a bit and then use for best results.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this item  Did not meet expectations . Too large and makes styling very difficult and awkward to handle.</li>
    <li> The first one lasted 6 months. The 2nd not more than 2 months. Love it when it works.  Very disappointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> Love it bought another</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my frizzy gray hair.  Sent it back.  Very disappointed.  Did get a quick refund!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money ladies. Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair maybe is not good for curly hair.</li>
    <li> i have very straight hair so i am always looking for something that can change that.  this is honestly the only styling brush i have ever used that gives my straight hair body like hot rollers.  i cant use this with wet hair but i do almost dry my hair and use this.  it gives it lift and body like nothing i have ever used.  it grabs and holds my hair perfectly.  for those with very straight hair, you will understand what i mean.  i have bought many products before only for my hair to slip though them.  this is also great for when i go to bed with my hair wet...i use it the next morning on dry hair and get the same results.  you will not be disappointed in this styling brush!</li>
    <li> I was worried that it was too big. My hair is just shoulder length and very fine. This brush is perfect! It gives me body and shine. My hair never looked so good. I first bought a much more expensive curling brush thinking I would get what I paid for but returned it when my hair looked flat. My hair is also died and highlighted and this brush makes it look great. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. One more thing; One reviewer said she didn&#x27;t read the 5 star reviews because those people would be happy with anything. This is absolutely not true. This is the first 5 star rating I&#x27;ve given. So yes, I would recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> This would be a great styler IF it had more power and more of a cool tip at the end to make using it more manageable. It grips and holds hair for styling very well, better than other hot air brushes. But it just doesn&#x27;t offer enough power. So using it takes longer and it can&#x27;t provide the level of lift and wave others can. I would love this product otherwise, especially given its increased ionic feature.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I purchased to replace one with a metal barrel.  This one has a nice grip and the brush bristles grab and hold hair much better.  Also, it really does take care of frizz.  I was very pleasantly surprised as I didn&#x27;t put alot of stock in the add but the majority of reviews said it worked great so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s a very noticeable difference from the last one I had. If I could make one improvement it would be the hot setting. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my last one, but then that is probably the materials are better on this one and that could also be why the frizz is controlled.  I&#x27;m not sure but overall this is a great product and I would buy again.  My hair is thick but fine with crazy curls in the back underneath portion with waive and frizz on the top section, but you&#x27;d never know that now.</li>
    <li> I really love this tool. I have never managed to be able to use both a round brush and a blow dryer at the same time effectively but I guess now I don&#x27;t need to. It dried my hair quickly, about 20 minutes, which for my long thick hair is almost a minor miracle.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, curly/wavy hair.  For years, I have tried everything to get my hair to behave -- straighteners (great to use, but so great for my hair), round brushes (I&#x27;m just not that coordinated on my own head), etc. I stumbled across this, and figured, &amp;#34;The price is right...I&#x27;ll give it a try.&amp;#34;  It seriously changed my (hair) life. I use it when my hair is slightly damp, and, in 15-20 minutes (keep in mind that I have A LOT of hair) I look like I just came from the salon. Seriously.</li>
    <li> Item works fine but I should have purchased the 1 inch for my hair length.</li>
    <li> I wish it blew out more air. Use to have a Revlon which busted and would dry my hair instantly. DBut the barrel size in the Revlon was too skinny for my thick long hair. With the John Frieda, love the barrel size, and leaves my hair shinny and flipped out ends.</li>
    <li> Best purchase this year.  Cuts time spent on hair and is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I got this for my elderly mom who needs a bit of help styling her hair.  Where has this been all of her life??!?!  She loves it and it makes her look like she just stepped out of a beauty salon.  Mind you, her hair is very, very fine and thin.  This makes her hair look like it has nice body and style.  I am so impressed with this little hot air brush.  Who would have thought this little thing could make such a BIG difference in her life!</li>
    <li> wonderful to help style your hair. It is nice to get out of the shower and go straight into styling.</li>
    <li> Very effective and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is not for African American hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush to add volume to my hair while drying trying to eliminate steps when styling after washing.  It does add some volume, but gets VERY hot when not on low.  Low simply takes too long.  Also, it does not smooth my hair the way a hair iron does so this would mean double heat on my hair.  My hair is very fine in texture and will not tolerate much heat without breakage even using heat protection products.  I&#x27;m sure this appliance could work well with someone with more robust hair texture.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the way the bristles hold my hair without pulling it or causing tangles.  Overall, I am disappointed in the performance and would not buy again.  I also recommend the smaller 1 inch barrel option.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Love it. Does what it says. Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this sooner. I use miracle 10 potion after washing my hair and let air dry a bit then section hair and use the air brush. Works great.</li>
    <li> This review compares the John Frieda Salon Shape 1.5 Inch Hot Air Brush to the Perfector. I vastly prefer the Perfector over the &amp;#34;Salon Shape&amp;#34;. I have long, fine, color treated hair. The Perfector works on dry hair. The Salon Shape&#x27;s biggest disadvantage is that it requires that hair be WET to work. So the Salon Shape is inconvenient to use for a quick touch-up, or say after work when going out. The Salon Shape merely gives the same results on my hair as a brush and blowdryer - but because it is a self-contained unit, it can be done one handed, and is much easier to use than a brush-plus-blow-dryer. However, the Salon Shape requires repeated strokes to get a curl (like a blow dryer) and the curl did not hold on my fine, straight hair. (It may be good for straightening??) The curl from the Perfecter only requires one stroke - and lasted much longer! Also, using the Perfector at my roots added nice volume that lasted all day. I did NOT notice improved &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; from EITHER product. The &amp;#34;Salon Shape&amp;#34; does not require warm-up time (but it still takes longer to use). The Perfector requires warm-up time - but that is usually under one minute! For straight fine hair, I recommend the Perfector...to me it is worth the extra money. However, the Salon Shape is a good alternative to a round-brush-and-blow-dry, if that is all you are looking for.</li>
    <li> This product has risen to the \\&quot;must have\\&quot; category of my many hair styling products. It&#x27;s a great everyday tool.</li>
    <li> I love my John Frieda Hot Air Brush! The bristles are pliable and gentle on my hair and scalp. I now have great shine and body without a lot of effort!</li>
    <li> I got this item because I wanted to cut down on the time it takes to dry my hair. By drying my hair in sections, this brush got the job done in record time. It also makes my hair really smooth and shiny. I live in a very humid area, so it does not always stay as I put it. I also have stubborn hair that refuses to turn in on one side, and this brush did not make any difference. It really helped add volume to my hair though.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer/curler out there! It&#x27;s so easy to use. It drys your hair slowly so it leaves it shiny, soft and super bouncy. If you&#x27;re in a rush I would recommend drying your hair to almost dry with regular hair drying and then just finishing up the ends with this. The brush does not spin which is great because I have long hair and I got all tangled up with one of those rotating brush dryers. Truly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Finally, I have a tool that I can manage to get a  professional look at home!  I could never coordinate the brush in one hand and the dryer in the other well enough to get a great look.  This convenient tool took care of that problem.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve never been able to do the job my stylist can with a round brush in one hand and dryer in the other but with this handy tool I can actually give myself a blowout at home anytime I choose. I&#x27;m so terrible at drying my own hair without this I was at the point that I never even bothered anymore. I would just towel/air dry on my own and then get a professional blow out when I wanted to look polished - more than I&#x27;d prefer to admit. Now I can look polished every time I shampoo. It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> I just cut off 7 inches of my hair and have a new bob.  I needed a styler that gave me the same results from when I get a professional blowout.  I was torn between this item and the Conair one that rotates.  I am glad I chose this one.  It has hot, med and cool settings and helps style great.  Plus now that I have the hang of it, its probably better that I didn&#x27;t get the con air rotating one because my thin hair would probably get caught  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on partially air dried hair as well as dry hair and have loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for new shorter hair cuts!</li>
    <li> This brush is wonderful! Iam very fussy I try them all. And this is easy and works really good. Quick and styles nicley,gets hot and cold so holds the style. Great price to!</li>
    <li> This Hot Air brush is great for damp hair.  It adds more volume than I expected but styling products brought that down.</li>
    <li> This hot brush is the best I&#x27;ve ever had! I have thin, fine hair, and this doesn&#x27;t tangle or pull my hair at all. I wear my hair slightly turned up, and it does a great job, especially when the hair is damp or sprayed with a styling lotion. Would buy again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> Convenient if you don&#x27;t like using both hands to blow dry your hair. Not very powerful, but does the job - just takes a bit longer than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for exactly for months, and not every day, more like 3 times a week. I love it, it really works well at styling, keeping freeze under control and perfect for long hair. But, I am very disappointed that it just broke, after only 4 months, it made a ssh noise and a bit of burning smell and smoke and that&#x27;t it, adios John Frieda brush.&lt;br /&gt;I am very upset that I can&#x27;t return it anymore, I don&#x27;t want my money back I want another brush, since I am 100% sure I had nothing to do with the damage.</li>
    <li> I rarely give something 5 STARS but this was close. I am 46 and have pretty straight hair. I was really surprised that I got the volume I was looking for the first time using it. Pleasantly pleased because I use 100% certified toxic free/organic products ONLY on my hair and it&#x27;s hard to get good volume without harsher product. No Frizzys either!</li>
    <li> This is a great tool.  I have some other ones that I have tried and they are way too heavy for me. This is light weight and I get a lot of compliments on how my hair looks.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I own,  so easy, so effective.  Shiny and healthy looking hair when your thru.  I have thick course hair.  It&#x27;s straightens it.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this.  This has made blow drying and styling my hair so much easier.  I save a lot of time on doing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair air-dry for 10-15 mins and then use this life saving air brush.  I section the hair with butterfly clips and simply dry and style my hair at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been interesting to see what the result would have been if the burst itself could spin as that would be an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. It wasn&#x27;t strong enough to dry quickly and hold. Too big too for shoulder length hair. I did like that the control from hot to cool were next to each other.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist suggested this to me after noticing breakage from my hair straightened. I have stick straight hair, but I wanted to get rid of frizz. Best thing I&#x27;ve ever bough for my hair. I have really baby fine blonde hair that struggles to get volume. I use this with the John Frieda spray and my hair comes to life. It&#x27;s bouncy, shiny, and frizz free.</li>
    <li> I had purchased several different brands of cheaper hot air brushes and they did the job, but most of the time , the hard plastic or rubber brush bristles would break off before the dryer stopped working. This one does a great job of drying and smoothing my past shoulder length hair and smoothing it. Very happy with it and hope the dryer lasts a good long time, as I&#x27;m sure the brush portion will.</li>
    <li> Good for finishing if you don&#x27;t like curling ironing. Hair needs to be almost dry. About 80% dry. Price is good too compared to Conair spin brush</li>
    <li> I have long hair and after I wash my hair I hate waiting for it to dry or put rollers in it.  I wear my hair up so this is a no brainier.  Do what ever you want with the Air Brush and you will love the way your hair looks, if you have thin hair you will love the body it gives you.  It&#x27;s fast and easy have fun.</li>
    <li> Great tool. Heats up at once, love the cool feature, does not seem as damaging as a flat iron (I have highlighted hair).  Gives big bouncy waves to my chin length medium thick and naturally wavy (but not curly) hair in minutes.  Also use it on dry hair each morning if I have not washed my hair and want to &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34;  the look.  However, I can&#x27;t use this on wet hair. Would take WAY too long.  I dry my hair to 90 percent before using.  Plan on taking it to Europe, eliminating other hair tools.  Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> My sister, unlike myself, has never just given in to her mop of curly hair. She fights it with any tool she can find. When I saw this I thought it would be a useful and appreciated gift, as she usually goes through hair dryers / straighteners pretty quickly. She loved this, says it works VERY well, andhas lasted for months! Recommended</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas. I have that not quite &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; but certainly beyond &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; type of hair; fine in texture but lots and lots and lots of hair. To put it to the test, I used no product. Nothing. I started with my hair almost completely dry (blown, definitely not air-dried, but not really &amp;#34;blown out&amp;#34; straight) then just ran this baby through my hair. I only sectioned top/bottom and I have a LOT of hair. I ended up with that effortless look that is not usually effortless at all for people with my type of hair, and with no product at all. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> This dries my hair with a bit of a smoothing effect, but not very much.  My hair is long and moderately curly, and if I use this, it creates more frizz and flyaways than blow-drying.&lt;br /&gt;It is good for adding volume to my roots, or if I&#x27;m on second-day hair I&#x27;ll use the cool setting after a dry shampoo to give my hair a bit of bounce at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s not really worth it unless you have short or very fine, thin, hair.</li>
    <li> The best one I have tried</li>
    <li> This works on my thick, natual cury hair...smooth as silk.  I air dry my hair until just damp and then I section and dry with the hot air brush...Perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this under the impression the barrel would rotate.. I was really disappointed when I realized I had made a mistake.  Nevertheless I used it for the first time and was so pleased with how my hair looked and felt!  Now I am very glad I did not get it with the rotating brush since I had one prior to buying this one and did have a few issues with my hair getting tangled and then it just stopped rotating after a few months.  So, once again I am very pleased and getting my hair dry did not take time at all! (medium length)</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d love this but I am surprised I don&#x27;t.  It is nice to use on mostly dry hair - mine is almost shoulder length and has some curl to it.  It doesn&#x27;t quite dry it flat enough to take the curl out and on the days I use it I find I have more flyaway hairs than on other days, with the same product usage (whether it&#x27;s gel or a pomade or smoothing spray, etc).  If I am drying my hair to leave fullness and some curl in the Hot Air Brush works well but then the fly away hairs seem more prevalent.  That&#x27;s my experience with my textured hair.</li>
    <li> The barrel is the perfect size. Doesn&#x27;t get very hot but detangles well. The only annoying thing (you&#x27;ll laugh cause it seems silly) is that the switch is hard to use. it&#x27;s a slide--the bottom is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and the top is &amp;#34;cool.&amp;#34; Low and high heat are in the middle. When I try to slide from &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; heat it goes all the way to &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;. I have to use two hands. I read the same comment on another review before I bought it and kinda brushed it off (no pun intended lol). But seriously that button is annoying! haha. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good air brush. I still use my blow dryer to get the excess water off and then a final dry with this. My hair feels smoother and looks shinier when I use the air brush.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that you need to blow dry your hair to get most of the moisture out, then use the hot air brush to style.  It gave me great body and shine on my long highlighted hair.  Just wish the dryer were more powerful to avoid the two step styling process.</li>
    <li> My African-American hair is texturized, meaning it&#x27;s mildly relaxed with a loose curly/wavy texture. Because my hair is partially natural, I still need a decent amount of heat to get it straight. I knew that this device would not get my hair bone straight but that I would have body and the ionic shine John Frieda promises. Well...it took me almost 4 hours to finish my thick, bra-length and 90% dried hair! It took so long that I was sweating from the exhaustion of the work! My hair took forever to dry despite being mostly dry because I had to take such small sections to get smooth results. This is not the brush for women with a lot of hair. However, I will say that my hair was super soft and had shine and body, but it only lasted 2 days. I will try to come up with ways to get better results, but for me and my mane, the real blow-out is better left to the beautician. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This product maybe be good, but not for really curly hair, it just doesn&#x27;t work. Sent it back, cause I did not like.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Nice combination of brush and hair dryer for a slightly smoother look to my otherwise very curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this for making my fine hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this brush to anyone who wants their hair smooth and soft&lt;br /&gt;The ease of using it is great ,even when you have arthritis&lt;br /&gt;My hair does not tangle in the brush even though my hair is fine</li>
    <li> but came dirty, full of hair. I do have a little discount for that, I&#x27;m happy. I will recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have long, wavy, and somewhat frizzy hair.  I&#x27;m pretty good with a round brush and hair dryer, but this tool makes all the difference.  It makes nice waves where I want them and straightens my hair where I want straight hair.  It also make styling go much faster.  I just loosely dry my hair with the hair dryer until it&#x27;s about 80% dry and then finish with the hot air brush.  Or I let it dry naturally to 80% and then finish with the air brush.  I was worried that my hair would catch in the brush, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I just roll, wait 8-10 seconds, and then twirl my hair loose.  I also use it at the roots for added volume.  My hair dresser just told me that I&#x27;m doing so much better styling my hair, and I told her it was because of this hot air brush.  I need less hair styling product with this, too, which saves me money.  I like this so much that I bought one for my sister.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift (I requested it), and in all fairness, I&#x27;ve only used it once.  I have quite thick, long (below my shoulders), naturally wavy hair.  I normally don&#x27;t dry my hair, because I&#x27;m lazy, but if I&#x27;m wanting to look decent, I generally dry and they flatiron.  I thought this appliance could essentially do both in one step.  Unfortunately, not.  It took an eternity (about 40 minutes, in case this doesn&#x27;t seem like an eternity to you) to get my hair dry with this thing.  HOWEVER, it looked great once it was done!  Much better than the flatiron approach, since it gave my hair more body.  I&#x27;m going to try it again but next time, I&#x27;m going to dry my hair until just slightly damp and then use it. Will let you know if this changes my rating.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This is much handier than having to hold a brush and a blow dryer.  I am SO impatient with the whole blow-drying procedure.  I like that it has two settings.  A little handle sticking out of the brush end would be handy, since that end can get hot, but you can always let your hand rest on the bristles if you have to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few years now and its dying already. I thought it would last longer</li>
    <li> I just trash my old one, because burned my very fine soft hair, regularly bleached. I am very happy with John Frieda brush,  is build from material which doesn&#x27;t overheat my hair.</li>
    <li> I prefer my drugstore Revlon to this one. No where to grasp the end without burring your fingers. Was actually a waste of $$ because my kids gave back my Revlon and this one sits under the sink not being used at all.</li>
    <li> Excelent hair brush, it doesnt damage the hair and it gives a good shine</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hot air styling brush! I have very fine straight hair and am not coordinated enough to use a round brush and dryer. This works great to style and add much needed volume.  I use this strictly for styling and dry my hair almost completely with my regular hair dryer. I use this for finishing and it is perfect.  The brush is stiff enough to hold the hair but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t scratch your skin.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law seems to like it &amp; says she is using it fine... I believe she used it for her on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Thank you...</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy and I couldn&#x27;t get my bangs to cooperate. When I first got them cut the stylist used a round brush and a hair dryer and I could not replicate the look, but I loved it. Tried a flat iron first, but then I lost all curvy completely. This device not only helps me achieve the look with my bangs, but also allows me to dry my hair with it too.</li>
    <li> Wet or dry my hair always benefits from this hot air brush. Not only does it smooth and straighten my hair, but it does it in a more natural way than hair straighteners with their coarse hair edges. This item is great at giving your hair that flip and body where you need it. I love this.</li>
    <li> After nurmerous tries of air brushes from jilbere,revlon and infinity conair ,I lost hope. All of those brushes left me with fly away hair, some frizz and no shine even with heat protectant and oil. John Freida is different, its comfortable, not too noisy, leaves your hair shiny smooth and styled in less time. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> You really have to work with this if you have fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;If not my hair looks flatter than not using it.&lt;br /&gt;It really does make my hair look shiny, however, not really what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;More than less work because of the flatness that seems to get created.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time today, and will definitely be keeping it. I had a cheaper conner one that was metal and would get hotting burn my hair quickly, however this product hasn&#x27;t done that at all. I have thick curly/wavy hair that goes to my mid-back, and I do need to have it almost dry before I start using the brush (easily done with an air dry or a rough dry).</li>
    <li> Only straightens hair. Does not curl it when you roll hair around brush. Waste of money if you already have a straightening.iron.</li>
    <li> Used it only once so far and my hair got really big! I am sure I am probably not doing it correctly as I didn&#x27;t want that much volume</li>
    <li> I love this round blow dryer. It does not rotate and this is exactly what they described and what I wanted. I&#x27;ve had it a while now and I can report that it works fantastic. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair , but thin and it works very well to dry quickly.  Don&#x27;t like the brush part very well, doesn&#x27;t let the hair wrap around the shaft to curl as well as I had hoped.  Bristles are to long, they need to be a bit shorter!  Also they fall out of the brush when I try to curl my hair.  Maybe after a while they will stop falling out.</li>
    <li> Just bought this product a few days ago, but I can tell already it is going to be a keeper.  I have used hot air stylers in the past but felt that they left my hair feeling overdone and somehow oily - enough that I gave up using them long ago.  This brush is different, and I think the ionizing + the bristles on the brush itself is what makes this one so useful.  Great drying capabilities - you need to blow dry your hair a bit to start, but this styler can take care of it from about half-dry. The 1.5&amp;#34; is a nice size for me to curl all my ends under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con: the handle on the 1.5&amp;#34; size is a little large and might deter some owners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and would say that if you are on the fence about this product to give it a chance.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for this product I decided to try it.  Glad I did.  No more hair dryer and trying to hold a brush...this is great...brush and dryer in one....love it.</li>
    <li> The John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush causes less frizz and gives a little more volume. It is easy to use no complaints.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time today - loved it!  It gives me the same smooth look that I get at the salon, but have been unable to achieve myself - so much easier than trying to maneuver with a round brush and blow dryer. I have naturally curly hair and this worked great to straighten it!</li>
    <li> This is a great buy for many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- You have in your hands only one piece, not an air brush in one and a brush in the another one.&lt;br /&gt;- That facility dry an style your hair because with your free hand you help to style.&lt;br /&gt;- It is very light so you can go more quickly because you are not tired for the weight.&lt;br /&gt;- It is not too hot because the ions does it not necessary. Result: minor damage to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;- It really really more easy dry your hair, that means that you will keep more fix it.&lt;br /&gt;- It is more easy add volume too.&lt;br /&gt;- I could to say that it air brush is better for thin and not very strong or damage hair.&lt;br /&gt;- It is not spin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What another thing can I say? I have two... it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sorry for my english)</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product - I&#x27;m not the best at hair styling, and always had issues with using a round brush and a blow dryer simultaneously  - but this product combines the 2. My hair looks great -full and smooth, without getting tangled in the bristles !&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the control buttons were easier to read and operate - but I&#x27;ve learned how to deal with them.</li>
    <li> Does not work for my hair and the curls immediately disappear  when your outside.The heat is not helping at all.</li>
    <li> long long beautiful blonde hair that now right above shoulder, still blunt cut.  didn&#x27;t need this wonder machine in past this past cuz i just pulled hair in top poneytail overnight and next day it was like day before...all full...no flatness from sleep.  NOW, that easy procedure is poof and  this brush is my hair lifesaver. makes my hair look like the long hair for body and super shine with little effort. love, love, love</li>
    <li> This brush worked great until the motor literally burnt out while I was drying my daughters hair tonight - I am EXTREMELY unhappy &amp; disappointed with the fact that I wasted money on this product, time to find something that will last longer than a month.</li>
    <li> This thing Works Great on thick dense hair. Makes hair styling easy. It is Easy to use and I got it at a Great Price.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would blow a little more heat than what it puts out.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people with naturally curly hair unless you use a flat iron in addition to this product.</li>
    <li> I am totally uncoordinated when it comes to blow drying and styling my shoulder length fine straight hair so when I saw this on a morning show, I decided to give it a try...and I love it. I do blow dry my hair with a normal hair dryer first to the point where I would usually get out my round style brush. It it easy to use and I find it powerful enough for my hair type. I just ordered a second one to have for traveling. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair so I must use a regular hair dryer first and then use this, which is  inconvenient.  I do like the product, but dislike needing two different hair dryers daily.</li>
    <li> It was a perfect tool to style my hair without using any other tools!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;As I find it difficult to use a blow dryer and a brush to shape my style, this tool is the perfect answer.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thick, long hair. I have to blow dry or towel dry my hair before using the Hot Air Brush. I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis but when I do use it, I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Works really well with my medium length straight bob. Easy to use and dries my hair quickly. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is actually better than the Revo brush I used to love. The two brushes work differently but the results are pretty similar, shiny and full hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush does not rotate, you rotate it with your hands. The brush emits hot and cold air. It has 3 settings, hot-low, hot-high and cold air. If you are in a hurry, I recommend you pre-dry your hair with a blow drier, otherwise it may take too long to dry using only this brush, even if you use the hot-high setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two of my sisters tried this brush and bought one each. One of my sisters has curly long hair and the other one wavy short hair. It works well for both. My son (who never tried the Revo) tried this brush and loved it, he said: &amp;#34;this is like having 3 hands&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush, the way it works, the way your hair looks afterwards and the price.</li>
    <li> I am just &#x27;ok&#x27; with this product.  It needs a &#x27;cool tip&#x27; to stablize while drying hair.  When it stops working I will not replace.</li>
    <li> I have now been using this for a week or two and really like the look of my hair.  I have frizzy, colored hair, mostly grey of course...but this hot air brush seems to like my hair.  I can just air dry my hair and come back later before an event and make it look decent in a few minutes - YAY !!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best investment I have ever made!  And I have only owned it for a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have spent a great deal of money and energy trying to find the best brushes and products to dry/style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curley and wavy hair which is thick and fine. I, of course, want smooth and straight hair when I finish styling.&lt;br /&gt;However, between manipulating a brush and a heavy hairdryer it becomes most tiresome trying to dry AND style your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot air brush is light and manageable. Does NOT get caught in your hair.... and you have a free hand to work with it! When finished, the cool setting gives a beautiful shine and volumne to your hair. I use a flat iron to ensure no frizz since I live in a very humid climate; BUT after just two uses of this brush, I could go without the flat iron in cooler weather.</li>
    <li> Really like this brush/hair dryer.  It is nice to only have one thing to take while traveling.  It will take longer to dry your hair but I really liked the results.  My hair was mosly frizz-free without using any product on it.</li>
    <li> Dries my long, thick hair in twice the time...does not overheat..when traveling, this is all I need...really good getting those ends to stay gently curled..</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job well.  If you need a blow dryer/brush, this won&#x27;t disappoint.  It sturdy in your hands, but not bulky or heavy.  Granted I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week, so I can not speak on it&#x27;s durability.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. It doesn&#x27;t burn yourself like a curling iron can but gets the job done. I have to pre blow dry my hair a bit though because my hair is thicker otherwise it would take a lot longer. Overall it is a great product that I use almost daily.</li>
    <li> until I purchased this one. I have very thick hair and the other hot air brushes I tried (and believe me..I tried FIVE different types) had bristles that were long enough to hold my hair, let alone dry as it styled. The added benefit of a cooling temp to lock in style and curles/waves is wonderful too. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this hot air brush...tames frizz, adds shine and really dries even the thickest hair as it styles.</li>
    <li> Have always had a hard time with the brush and blow dryer, however this is just wonderful. doesn&#x27;t snag your hair and does the job to perfection</li>
    <li> Dryer does not measure up. Does not have enought air output to dry ones hair quickly like my regular dryer.[[ASIN:B0056GDG90 John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush]]</li>
    <li> I read about this hot air brush in a magazine and it was highly recommended.  I checked around and Amazon had the best price, so i ordered it.  I like it and it does seem to make my hair fuller.  I have fairly thin hair so i don&#x27;t know how it would work with thicker hair.  All in all, i am glad to have it my haircare products.</li>
    <li> It is just right for my wavy but unruly hair. It controls my waves nicely. Mission accomplished in less than ten minutes.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Makes your hair sleek and smooth. Love the fact that it&#x27;s a hair dryer and straightener all in one.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product. I initially bought it because I broke my arm and was unable to blow dry my chin length hair one-handed. As I am now regaining use of both arms, I start by blow drying and then use the brush to style it (it&#x27;s faster this way). I will continue to use this product to style my hair each day.</li>
    <li> If you use both hands on the brush, the heat will burn the hand that is on the end opposite the handle.Otherwise it does a good job drying &amp; shaping the hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I have had ones that work a little better for my hair.  I find that the style with a few strips of hard bristles intespersed with the soft bristles allow for more accurate styling.  That said, I like this product and will not replace it for a while.</li>
    <li> This hot air brush has simplified my mornings.  Highly recommend it to anyone who is tired of trying to style your hair with a hair dryer and a brush.  A combination of both--this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Well, to honest I thought it was a rotating brush, but unfortunatelly it was not. It is not too noise. Anyway It´s helpfull.</li>
    <li> What makes this hot air dryer stand out is the quality of the brushes.  I have found hotter styling brushes but not with the heavy-duty brushes of this dryer.  I think it is best for hair approaching shoulder length.  It will do well on chin-length hair but it will not give you much curl.  If they would offer a smaller size barrel of the same quality,  with the same quality brushes it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> good product, very pleased</li>
    <li> Takes a while but does a nice job.</li>
    <li> I recently grew out my naturally curly, very short hair to a bob.&lt;br /&gt;Every day it was a struggle to hold the hair dryer and use brush to achieve the straight style I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;I read about this John Freida product in Real Simple magazine, and decided to give it a try.  I loved it immediately! It is easy to use to get perfect results every time.  I am so dependent on this product that I ordered a second one  for a back up. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice piece of equiptment, but is not really strong enough to dry your hair.  Works best if your hair is mostly dry and you want to finish the look.  I guess I like the old fashioned brush and dryer!</li>
    <li> This is my first product like this.  I have never had a curling iron that blows.  Great quality. Nice curl.  I have only had mine for a few weeks so cannot speak to durability.  It has been doing well so far.</li>
    <li> Having fine hair has been a problem for me and I can never grow it out because it lies so flat.  This hot air brush solves that problem!  In addition, hair doesn&#x27;t fly all over the bathroom and accumulate in the tub or on the floor like it does with a regular hairdryer (the brush collects the hair).  Also, this has helped alleviate problems with my carpel tunnel.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I had to return this because my hair is way too thick for this product. I was hoping this hot air brush would make my hair smooth and manageable but it just left my hair with weird waves and kinks in it.</li>
    <li> Had to return this hot air brush as it did not work to dry or style my shoulder length fine hair. I tried it a couple of times to see if partially drying with a regular hair dryer reduced static or improved the look of my hair. I expected better, and am still looking for a replacement product. Mine did not heat up that much, it may have been defective. Amazon&#x27;s return process was simple for me - that department gets 5 stars :)</li>
    <li> I liked this brush very much and the only complaint I have is that it is not dual voltage. Luckily at home in Chile I have a transformer  but it is much too heavy to to travel with. Please sell one that is either dual voltage or 220-240 volts</li>
    <li> I use this when I have I want my hair super smooth and soft.  It does a great job with long, thick hair.  My hair was already completely dry when I used it and it smoothed away flyaways, added volume and lasting curl to my ends.</li>
    <li> good purchase.  my hair does not get tangled in it and love that you can use this instead of the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This does not blow enough hot air. Could not use and had to send back. Dealer was very helpful but I just didn&#x27;t like the product.</li>
    <li> Yanks all my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;It is not good at drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to hassle with returning it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  My hair is thin so it takes no time to blow it straight.  So much easier than using a separate blower and brush.</li>
    <li> Gets really hot on the ends of the tips really fast &amp; if you have really thick hair, it will take forever to dry it this way.  You have to sit for an hour to let your hair dry naturally &amp; then it takes another hour to use the dryer.</li>
    <li> I like this product and use it daily. I would buy it again. It is very good at grabbing the hair and does a great job of styling. But is suffers from two design flaws. One is that the button for &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; (which is the one most likely to be used I think) has to be carefully selected on the sliding control switch. No big deal, but why not put it at the top where we can easily move to it without thinking? Secondly, the flat end piece gets hot. Other hot air brushes I&#x27;ve used have some kind of a cool knob or something in case you want to hold the end to create some stability while you are styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, hot air brushes just aren&#x27;t that complicated of an appliance and you&#x27;d think someone would get it exactly right. This one&#x27;s better than others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a hot air brush for a number of years and like the styling easy.  This brush I really liked when I first got it.  The motor blew within 6 months.  I don&#x27;t have long or thick hair. I would say this hot brush is not meant for daily use.  I was hoping my purchase was covered by some sort of warranty, but no.  But if you occasionally use.</li>
    <li> I have long middle of my back length hair, it&#x27;s naturally wavy, but if I scrunch it with product, it&#x27;s very curly.&lt;br /&gt;To straighten my hair I use a blow dryer and a large round brush.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this product I thought it would be easier to have the round brush and dryer in 1..... I was wrong&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not enough heat blowing hot enough or hard enough. This will make your hair FRIZZY!&lt;br /&gt;This will make your hair look, like you ALMOST finished styling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Like you were styling your hair and half way through decided you weren&#x27;t going to style your hair after all.&lt;br /&gt;This product is just awful! It&#x27;s weak on the hot air too, so it will take foreveeeeeer to style your hair so you can go out with frizzy hair! Nice:) if you want bad hair which took you an hour to achieve, then buy this product, and enjoy crappy hair for the rest of your life!!</li>
    <li> After about 10 uses, some of the bristles came out, and the remaining ones are not straight anymore. I like the outcome it produces, but I can&#x27;t see it lasting very long. It needs to be made with stronger bristles that can withstand heat.</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair that lacks body this brush is great.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased and the first one is still going strong.  I brought the second one so I wouldn&#x27;t have to be without one.  Please don&#x27;t stop making this product.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair which I wear straight.  I wash hair and put in big rollers while wet and let it air dry.  It dries nice and straight.  I use this hot air brush to sometimes briefly blow out some sections or more frequently after I&#x27;ve washed my face or showered and before the curls take over, I blow dry the damp parts.  I&#x27;ve been using hot air brushes for years mostly for the bangs and two side pieces.  Can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I like this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, very comfortable handle and leave hair smooth and shiny&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change temperature</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair as smooth as I&#x27;d hoped, but it works.</li>
    <li> It broke down after 4 uses. And each time, i took only 20 minutes to go through my hair as I always towel dry my hair before using it. Sad....</li>
    <li> Works very well, adds volume and sleekness.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smooths and curls nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she reports that it works wonderfully. She says she is satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Incredible tool, the best I&#x27;ve ever used to straighten my curly hair.  Unfortunately I bought mine yesterday at Walgeens for $39.99 but I am still thrilled. I&#x27;m going to purchase another here today for my daughter to have.  I have used a regular hair dryer with a round brush, chemical relaxers, flat irons etc but this tool didn&#x27;t fry my hair as the heat setting is lower.  The trick is to let your hair dry quite a bit by air, then use it according to directions.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite old standby tool was the RevoStyler with the spinning brush.  It was great, while they lasted.  The handle needed to be charged &amp; over time it lost it&#x27;s power.  That tool is now over $80 (if you can find one), plus the bristles on the brush were very soft &amp; didn&#x27;t pull through your hair very well, or with enough force.  This Salon Shape tool has a brush with two types of bristles and works great!  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just got this last week and LOVE It already!  Easy to use, no tangles, perfect big soft curl and boyd!</li>
    <li> Nice hot air brush. However the brush part was too big and I had to return it.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair which is very thick. My hair is naturally wavy and a bit frizzy.  My hair is mid length - longer part of it touches my shoulder blades and shortest part is a bit longer than chin lenght. This brush definitely doesn&#x27;t replace a hair dryer but I was not expecting it to do so. I got it to style my hair without the damage caused by straightening irons. While the brush does a decent job of leaving my hair shiny it does not leave it completely straight and I am not able to flip the ends out as I would like to do. As my hair looks better after I use it than before I do, I am keeping it. Maybe I will have better results after a few uses. So far, I have tried it twice. I also got the Conair Infiniti Pro Spinning  Brush and I hated it. This one is not perfect but much better than the Conair in my opinion. Even though the conair spins and this does not all that the spinning does is tangle my hair. I cannot get the ends to flip either and the conair does not grab my hair as well as this one to straighten it. I will keep using the John Frieda and will update the review if I figure out a better way to use it. I am sure that for someone with not so thick and less wavy hair this may work better. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I love this hot air brush.  It styles my thin, flyaway hair very nicely.  I like the different settings (low, high, cool mode).  The bristles are soft but hold my hair well without pulling it.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because the power switch is a little hard to turn on and off.  It&#x27;s a bit stiff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out different style hot air brushes, and seem to like this one better than others, for the following reason (BTW: I&#x27;ve got shoulder length hair, cut in layers, and I wear it kind of like a long &amp;#34;shag&amp;#34; style, so I&#x27;m not looking for tight curls): The size of this barrel is perfect if you&#x27;re not looking for small or tight curls. It&#x27;s 1 1/2 inches, which is the largest I&#x27;ve found ... perfect for longer cuts where curls aren&#x27;t the goal, but soft waves are. The bristles on this one have a combo of black plastic ones, with a single plastic one with the &amp;#34;dot&amp;#34; on the end of it, which makes it &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; onto your hair so you can actually brush with it. Others, same size, but different type bristles, w/o that &amp;#34;dot&amp;#34; that this one has, don&#x27;t let you grab your hair to actually get it to brush through it. For this reason, I may keep this one, even though I like a different one (which rotates, and is the same size. That one is difficult to actually get to grab onto my hair to brush with it.) Also, be aware that these don&#x27;t blow very strongly, like a hair dryer, but if you leave it on high, it DOES get hot. Hot enough so that when using your hands to keep your hair wrapped around the barrel, you can burn yourself if you&#x27;re not careful. It&#x27;s NOT like the ones that you can touch and don&#x27;t get hot. These DO get hot when using the high setting, but you don&#x27;t get much power or air coming out of it. I think I&#x27;m still &amp;#34;in search&amp;#34; for the perfect tool. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I buys tons of stuff on Amazon and don&#x27;t usually write reviews. However, this product is amazing! I have struggled with my hair for as long as I can remember.  It is colored and highlighted and looked like straw due to alternate day flat ironing. I received this in the morning and used in on freely washed hair that was 80% dry. Salon like blow-dry! Truly amazing and transformational!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Have a sprained wrist at the moment so can&#x27;t really get into it.</li>
    <li> The John Frieda Salon Sharpe hot air brush is easy to use and styles your hair very nicely.  Before buying it, I read both comments negative and positive.  Decided to try, after all you are not loosing anything.  If you don&#x27;t like it just return it. My hair is shoulder length and semi full.  This is not a hair dryer you should dry your hair before styling, at least partially dry, otherwise it will take a long time. I use it in the morning on a dry hair and it works great.  Before styling, I apply small amount of blow dry lotion to my hair and than style. At most, it takes me 15 mins to style. I&#x27;m not sure how it would style very thick and long hair.  I like this gizmo, it is one piece, switch is okay I have no problems with it (if you like to which between the settings while styling, it might be abit awkward) and it has a long cord (which you don&#x27;t find it now a days). It looks well made and easy to hold. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase and use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I was looking for.  However, I was impressed with it that I decided to keep it.  I am not sure why individuals have an issue with the selector switching to cool.  It has not happened to me at all.  It took me a couple of times to get a hang of using the styler quick and effectively.  FYI, my hair is naturally curly and mid back length and if you are used to straightening your hair all the time no matter what tool you use this one will be just as easy.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 air brushes at the same time; the John Frieda 1.5 and the Helen of Troy 1.5. Between the two brushes, I like this one a little better because it is a little more powerful. I have medium-long thick hair and have to mostly dry my hair before I use this air brush.  When mostly dry, I use the air brush to finish and straighten. My hair is very wavy in the back near the roots, and this brush pulls that out to an extent, but does not fully straighten or smooth it. I do like the end result because my hair is smooth and shiny.  I turn the brush on before I actually use it, so it can warm up. I leave it running between hair sections so it remains warm and more effective. The bristles are soft and pliable, but strong enough for my thick hair. The barrel does not rotate. Many years ago, I broke my right wrist and had bad hair for 2 months cuz I was in a cast. I used an air brush like this, using only my left hand and it is what saved my style.  I do wish they would make one of these that has more air power. While this is adequate, and better than the Helen of Troy, it could be much more powerful and more effective.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair cut into a bob and I&#x27;ve used every brand of cheapo round brush dryers Walmart sells--Conair, Revlon, whatever.  I also got one at Sally Beauty.  This one&#x27;s by far THE BEST I have used.  The other dryers get hot enough to really put a curl in, but they also fry my hair if I&#x27;m not careful.  This one leaves my hair in great condition.  It&#x27;s not hot enough to give a super styled look, but I use it for every day just to give a little curved shape to my hair.</li>
    <li> This is soo much fun to use. Just dry your hair 80% dry and then use it. Don&#x27;t try to use it with fully wet hair. The styling aspect is great for us wanna be hair stylists! It won&#x27;t style your hair straight like a blowout, more like beautiful volume waves. A little soft hairspray and you look like you just came back from the salon. Very happy!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use... you should defiantly use a blow dryer first to mostly dry your hair... Tamed my unruly hair...Great results</li>
    <li> What a waste of money and your time! It is useless. It might work on extremely thin, short hair. Disappointing!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the closest to a professional blow out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for over a year and it is terrific.  It is so much easier than using both a brush and hair dryer.  It is easy to handle and leaves my hair less frizzy than when I used to blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that it would be better if the tip would not get hot but it is a minor inconvenience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now. I have AA mixed curly hair. This brush and these bristles are great for this type of hair. Gets hot enough to get a decent blow dry in. I hated blow drying my own hair with normal dryers. What&#x27;s great about the these dryers is it&#x27;s less work than holding a dryer and a brush. Sectioning hair with this tool definitely helps and waiting for hair to be semi dry helps too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom was in town and loved it, so I bought her one too. It&#x27;s never gonna be as great as a salon blow out, but this definitely helps at home drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the highest setting was hot and not cool. It&#x27;s a little counterproductive to make the final setting the cool one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ve been looking for a hot air brush since a hairstylist used one on my hair and I loved the volume I got from it. Plus I&#x27;m not too good at round brushing and blow drying my hair at once. So I really wanted something like this. I have thin shoulder length hair and wanted something that would give me volume. This does that but not as good as the salon. It gives volume but my hair seems to go flat after a while. It&#x27;s not as hot as I would like so when my hair is wet it takes too long to style and dry with this. Works better if hair is damp. So I usually blow dry a little first then finish with this brush. I may be better off with just a regular hair dryer to save the extra step.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of trying to do a professional blowout on myself using my hair dryer with a regular round bush. My hair always came out frizzy, burnt, and just dead. After searching for a hot air brush I came upon the John Frieda brand and was amazed by the reviews, so I decided to give it a try. When the product finally arrived I was so happy! I tried it right away. I recommend letting your hair air dry first and foremost. If you&#x27;re like me and it takes your roots forever to dry then go ahead and use your regular hair dryer with the flat nozzle thingy to dry your scalp first and just let it air dry. I was extremely happy with how easy it is to use.&lt;br /&gt;A little tip to all you ladies having trouble achieving volume, waves, etc. it all depends on how your hair is cut and don&#x27;t forget to divide your hair in sections! I had long hair and was having trouble getting volume.I asked my hair dresser to give me a cut with lots of layers and volume and once I blow dry it I am always pleased with the results. At times I even do the Kate Middleton blowout! I even attached a picture of my every day hair using the hot brush.&lt;br /&gt;I even took it with me to Mexico this May only to sell it to my aunt because she was just as amazed as I was.</li>
    <li> The hot air brush is lightweight and brings about quick results.  I think it will be a great option for packing for occasional travels.  The slide button that operates the settings needs to be a bit more obtrusive, as it&#x27;s not easy to slide to the low/high and cool settings as I would like it to be.  Nevertheless, I like the brush and use it often.</li>
    <li> I love how this both smoothes and styles damp hair.  It makes a large curl at the ends.  I wish that I would have gotten the 1inch as I would like a greater curl in my long hair.  My neighbor has one and it creates a nice bouffant in her short hair.  Hair is much sleeker and conditioned using the ion technology.  It has cool and warm settings.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush!! Easy to use, hair has not gotten tangled and it makes my hair look good and full of volume! :)&lt;br /&gt; No frizz so far but we have not hit the time of year where that is a problem. The trick is to dry your hair about 80% before using it. I have both air dried and used a hairdryer-still great results. Thank you John Frieda!!!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected my fault I thought I was rotating hot airbrush</li>
    <li> Have been trying to grow my hair out and was really struggling with making it look good during the transition.  This tool is perfect!  Better tan hot rollers, in-styler, etc.  I have very think hair so I get it almost dry then use the hot air brush to finish drying and style.  I have about a dozen different styling tools and this is my current favorite.</li>
    <li> The thing that irritates me the most about this product is that my ability to return it just expired.  It does not work at all, it is easily the most useless hair styling product I have ever bought in my life.  I would be less angry if I got my money back, but now I just have an ugly paper weight on my hands.  DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I read a ton of reviews before buying this because I definitely wanted a hot air brush and wanted to get the right one.  I have past the shoulder, straight, highlighted hair that needs styling or it just looks like a frizzy mess.  I bought this as a replacement for 1) my flat iron, to reduce hair damage, and 2) my nice round brush I use to attempt to get the blow out your hairdresser gives you - you know ladies, where your arms about fall off.  I was either going to get this one or the Conair Spin Pro (the John Frieda is by Conair, too).  After seeing the bulk of the other one in the store, I opted for this one.  I think the auto spinning is kind of a novelty anyway and appears prone to breaking from the reviews.  When I got this in the mail, I was immediately impressed that it was lightweight.  Like others have mentioned, it would be tough to tangle your hair in it.  I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be hot enough, but it was.  The heat is instant and it is as hot as my hair dryer, but not super hot, which was good since I&#x27;m trying to minimize damage.  (If you want a super hot air brush, Sally&#x27;s Beauty has a popular one.)  The slide switch gives you 4 options - heat/low, heat/high, cool/high and off.  The switch isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is flat so you don&#x27;t bump it accidentally, I&#x27;m sure that was the point of the design.  My hair normally dries quickly - probably 7-9 minutes with a blow dryer.  I did my whole head from towel dry the first time to see how long it would take and it took 15 minutes all in.  Drying from root to tip and then rolling my hair with the brush gave it body and model-like bounce.  I pinned it up, did my makeup, then let it all down.  I have to say, I got some real head turns that evening.  Most of the time I&#x27;ll probably use this after I either air dry for awhile or use a hair dryer to get most of the wet out first.  I still needed some leave-in conditioner or shine product (you can do this before or after) and if you use this for more of a straightlook, you may still want to run a flat iron on the ends, but I&#x27;m very satisfied based on my expectations for this item.  BTW, I don&#x27;t work for the company (I always wonder when I read a glowing review.)</li>
    <li> Just like any new/different appliance, you will need to give yourself time to learn how to use this; once you learn the techniques you&#x27;ll love it!  I was pretty disappointed the first time I used it, but discovered the best way to use it (for me, at least).  Most important?  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS and wait until your hair is mostly (80%) dry - seriously.  This thing is not very powerful; if your hair is mostly wet you&#x27;ll be wasting your time.  After towel-drying, comb through then do whatever else you need to do - drink your coffee, check your email, apply your makeup, etc.  Don&#x27;t leave your hair wrapped up in the towel, it will take longer to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re ready, put your index fingers at the top of your ears and slide them straight back, horizontally under your hair to the back of your head until your fingers meet; put all of the hair above your fingers into a clip at the top of your head.  Focus only on the hair that&#x27;s left hanging.  Grab a section of it, turn the brush on to &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; and glide slowly through your hair (either above or below your hair, depending on the look you want) from roots to about an inch or two from the ends (don&#x27;t brush through the ends!).  While the hair is still in the brush, hold that hank of hair with your other hand and repeat this step until that length of hair is COMPLETELY dry, maybe 3-4 slow passes.  On the final pass-through, continue all the day through the ends, curling the brush very slowly.  Continue these steps on all of the hair that&#x27;s hanging down.  When it is completely dry, remove the clip, put your index fingers at your eyebrows, slide to the back of your head and clip up that hair.  Then follow the same steps as above to dry the hair that&#x27;s now hanging down.  Once you have done this to your entire head, keep running the brush through your hair (I&#x27;ve always left it on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;, so I don&#x27;t know if &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; will work differently) until it is COMPLETELY dry - that is very important.  As you work your way up your head, it will feel like each section of hair is dry, but when you think you&#x27;re all done, run your fingers through your hair - odds are it will still be very slightly damp under the thickest parts.  Just keep brushing as if you were using a regular brush.  If your hair is not completely dry, it will get frizzy.  When I&#x27;m done, I put 2 small squirts of Frizz Ease Hair Syrum in my palms, rub them together, then run my hands down the entire length of my hair, crown to tips, focusing mostly on the ends and the areas where my layers stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend about 5 more minutes using this dryer as opposed to my old hairdryer.  After having kids, my normally stick-straight hair became wavy and frizzy; the only way to control it was to blowdry and use a curling iron.  I don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron after I&#x27;m done using this brush (I probably still would for special occasions though), and I&#x27;ve cut the time I spend on my hair every morning in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers had problems, saying the brush quit working not long after purchase.  There is a 3-year warranty on it, so I did make sure I saved my receipt.  The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found is that it&#x27;s really easy to accidentally slide the switch from &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; as you&#x27;re working, and if you&#x27;re not paying close attention you might not notice it right away.  The switch needs to be a little tighter so that this doesn&#x27;t happen so often.  Oh, and the coupon for Frizz-Ease Shampoo and Conditioner that was included in the box was already expired :( Other than that, I absolutely LOVE this brush.</li>
    <li> Was just what I was looking for. Works to give my hair body&#x27;s and nice you can use only one item instead of hair dryer and curling iron</li>
    <li> My hairstyle does look smoother. But, the temperature does not get hot enough to do any much more dramatic than a blow dryer and a round hairbrush.The air flow should be a little faster as well. It&#x27;s reputation is actually much bigger than what the hot brush can actually do. You may as well save your money.</li>
    <li> The product worked well on my hair, which can be hard to curl.  It would be great if they would have a smaller brush that could be inter-changed.</li>
    <li> Love it because I didn&#x27;t have to flat iron my hair afterward. Gives the best of both worlds straightens with a bit of bounce.</li>
    <li> I read about this in Cosmo and decided to give it a try. I usually get tired of holding my arms up halfway through blowing my hair out, and just give up on the back...anyway...first, I thought the brush would spin (it doesn&#x27;t).  I thought the brush would grab and tangle my hair (it doesn&#x27;t) or not grab it at all (it does). I have pretty thick hair, so I blow dry it 85% of the way and then style with this brush.  You won&#x27;t believe how easy it is and how smooth and natural looking your hair comes out!  It even works on my cowlick right smack in the middle of the front of my head. From the first time I used it, I received compliments on my hair!</li>
    <li> Like most women, I find it impossible to hold a styling brush in one hand and a hair dryer in the other.  When I saw the John Frieda Hot Air Brush on &amp;#34;The View&amp;#34;, it sounded like the solution to my problem.  AND IT IS!!!  I have already mentioned it to several friends and even my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> The wattage is too low for the product to dry your hair faster. You end up combing your wet hair for so long that it can only result in breakage than drying/styling. My friend has a panasonic brush and I couldn&#x27;t find that one on amazon hence bought this one after reading +ve reviews. Alas!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick curly hair, and was skeptical given some other reviews about this working well enough. Doesn&#x27;t look like a professional blowout, or maybe I haven&#x27;t learnt how to use it properly yet, but does definitely give a nice blowdried look + bounce. The only downside is the heat isn&#x27;t strong enough to dry wet hair so have to wait till it&#x27;s drier.</li>
    <li> Another HG hair tool for me. This is essential to my routine now. I have been looking for a long time for a good hot air brush that did what it says. I found this finally awhile ago and it is super reliable, hot, and makes serious waves and smooths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost a hair dryer but its not. It&#x27;s made to be used when your hair is almost dry, about 90% or so and you can get that salon blowout look with it. This has become an every wash routine tool for me now ( I know I shouldn&#x27;t because of heat damage) and I am trying to use it less, but it&#x27;s so nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use heat protector and leave-in conditioner and wow. It&#x27;s seriously like I came out of the salon after a great blow-out. It has three heat settings, hot, warm and cool like a dryer. The heat doesn&#x27;t get so hot that you worry it will fry your hair; nothing like a flat iron at 450 degrees or anything. You can touch your hair as it dries/curls because the bristles are long and you can&#x27;t touch the barrel easily. NO BURNS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ionic technology and a ceramic barrel to boot. Great product for the price at $29.99 on Amazon, other places I see it range from $40-50.</li>
    <li> no need to use the blow dryer on my hair...just let hair dry for 20 minutes or so then use this appliance.</li>
    <li> I will advise all the ladies to buy this product. it makes my day much easier. and it is healthier for your hair. with this product you wont need to use a flat iron because it does the job for my hair. it is comfortable to use. this product was made with love. it is yes, yes yes I love it.</li>
    <li> I think this is a wonderful product for women who have medium length, fine or thining hair.  I have very fine hair and it&#x27;s cut in a bob hairstyle.  I get more volume with this Hot Air Brush than I have ever accomplished with other products and equipment.  If you have medium or thick hair, don&#x27;t bother because it will take you forever to dry your hair.  But for me, it&#x27;s a perfect tool.  Only suggestion to the manufacturer is to fix the button because trying to put it on high or low is difficult.</li>
    <li> I thought the John Frieda salon would be a spinning brush.  Not for natural Coily hair. More for silky hair</li>
    <li> If you have no hair and don&#x27;t want a lot of volume it&#x27;s okay.  Both my friend and I bought one from Amazon and neither one of us can get it to give the volume others have said.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than velcro rollers. Smooth hair with shine. I have a jaw length bob.I love it!</li>
    <li> I love my hot air brush. I have very curly hair and i hate to use a flat iron it takes all the body out of my hair. the air brush allows me to straighten with a bit of body and curl. i love it. thanx</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, dry and frizzy hair.  So, styling my hair is a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;It takes me forever and at the end, I look like a lion due to the puffiness of my hair! ;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but... NOT ANYMORE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this hot air brush almost 9 months ago and I&#x27;ve been using it almost every week.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Even I have long hair, I don&#x27;t have problem at all blowing and styling it with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to handle, the cord is pretty long which is a plus, and I don&#x27;t get tired or feel uncomfortable using it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my hair dry so fast. Maybe, because it&#x27;s thin compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my personal opinion, it does wonders to my hair!&lt;br /&gt;So, if your hair is like mine, give it a try!</li>
    <li> This is very useful stuff. My wife was very glad about this hot air brush and features. Thanks a lot for in-time delivery:)</li>
    <li> Works well! Smooth and silky hair after!</li>
    <li> Great product! I love the cool as well as the heat setting, no more handling the brush in one hand and the blow dryer in the other!</li>
    <li> This does exactly what I wanted it to.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of other reviews saying it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough -  that&#x27;s what I like about it. I don&#x27;t like damaging my hair with high heat,  and I have particularly dry hair to begin with. I have long (past shoulders) wavy hair and I use this after I blow-dry most of the moisture out of my hair at the roots.  Then I use this to round the ends of my hair and smooth frizzies. My mom used mine when I was visiting and she went out and got one.  She has wavy short hair.  I also didn&#x27;t want one that rotates,  since my old one did that and my hair would get caught in the gap all the time.  This one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Works like I wanted it to.</li>
    <li> The brush works great. My only complaint is that my thumb rests on the temperature/on/off switch and keeps turning it to cool. Very annoying. Other than that, I really like the brush.</li>
    <li> not to heavy a little warm on the end but is what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Love this.  Hair dries nicely, doesn&#x27;t tangle in brush.  The best!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Keeps hair from getting frizzy.  I had used a hotter hot air brush for years and was afraid this one wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough but it works perfectly on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Definitely my favorite Air Brush I have ever gotten.  I normally use Revlon but I really like this one best.  It has a cold shot button which is handy to set curls.  I like that it has a short handle and easy to use.  I like the bristles with my thick hair.  I think it is probably good on all types of hair.  Some of the Revlon ones could be a bit rough on the scalp.</li>
    <li> In the past, I haven&#x27;t liked these roller brush dryers because they took forever to dry and style my thick hair. Now, my hair has thinned and I was looking for a better style tool than just a blow dryer and roller-brush. I came across this John Frieda Hot Air Brush and decided to give it a try. After a couple month&#x27;s use, I am pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first towel-dry then air-dry while I do my makeup, or blow-dry until just damp before using the air brush. If you start from just towel-dried hair, the air brush is going to take you a long time to dry your hair completely.  Then I section off my hair into four sections and use the Hot Air Brush to finish drying and styling my hair. I just do a basic blow dry with some curled ends - nothing fancy. And for this, the Air Brush does the job pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a regular dryer and roll-brush where you are mainly blowing the top of your hair - I use this underneath the hair. This seems to help with the frizz factor. My hair wants to rebel and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give five stars because of a few product faults: one is that the high setting gets extremely hot - so that it would very easy to scorch your hair if you are not paying attention. There is no real &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting, just an air setting. To get a curl to set you do need the cool setting. Lastly, the switch mechanism is flat and sometimes you can&#x27;t get a grip on it with your fingers if they are too dry, making it hard to switch between settings as you use it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick glossy hair and wanted to be able to put a little curl in her hair. This John Frieda Hot Air Btprush did the trick! Because her hair is thick, it often takes a long while to style her hair, but with this styling tool, 15 minutes top! She is a very busy mother and professional and in the morning time is limited. She plugs this in, and when she is ready from yes it, it is ready for her. She does not need to turn upside down to get her styled the way she wants.  The brush works very well and is easy to use. She has tried every hair tool known to man, this succeeds where others have failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not have given her a better Mother&#x27;s Day present!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-10-14</li>
    <li> First, want to say i have fine, blonde, northern Euro hair which is mostly straight but wavy in parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this drier-brush to smooth out my hair and give it some overall body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: What is so like is the placement of the buttons. Because its a slide button, you don&#x27;t accidentally turn in on and off and i like that the brush is some kind hair and not plasticy. Light and easy to hold and works quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Doesn&#x27;t quite smooth out hair for some reason! Can&#x27;t figure out why! My previous one made my hair like glass - so soft and silky - but this doesn&#x27;t do this. If it can&#x27;t get soft hair soft, i can&#x27;t imagine the trouble it will have getting coarse/curly hair straight!</li>
    <li> I got this thinking I could use it as a hair dryer - it would take forever to dry my shoulder length hair with this.  Not much heat (even on high) or much in the way of blowing power.</li>
    <li> I write very few reviews but only because I normally forget. I HAD TO write one for this. It is amazing!! I love it! I have shoulder length curly hair... not too thick, not too thin. This takes it from wet to gorgeous in about 20 minutes! Now, it isn&#x27;t like a flat iron and you won&#x27;t have stick straight hair. That&#x27;s what a flat iron is for. This is to straighten and style your hair with BODY! I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. I am even considering buying another one just so I have a back up... I love it that much.</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself as well as my daughter. We let our hair almost dry and use this and it comes out beautiful.</li>
    <li> So handy. I can&#x27;t wait to use this once my hair gets even longer.</li>
    <li> Very weak blowing system.  What a major disappointment. The handle is so thick that it&#x27;s hard to handle with just one hand.  I couldn&#x27;t possible wait all day for my hair to dry using this system.  I would never recommend this device.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. Perfect</li>
    <li> It took some time to figure out how to use it but now that I have it down, this is the only way I&#x27;ll dry my hair. I love that instead of using a hair dryer and then a curling iron, I can simply use this and be done. It also cuts down on the frizzies and fly-aways which is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> This does what I need.  It&#x27;s a perfect size for my shoulder length hair.  My only complaint is that the cool setting is one setting up from high and sometimes my finger accidentally slips onto the setting switch and moves it from high to cool.  I&#x27;m a lefty, so it might be operator error.  That gets pretty annoying, but otherwise I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve mastered the technique of drying my hair with a large roller brush.  This is fluff.  I didn&#x27;t return figuring it was more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides.. maybe my daughter or grands can use it.  Only problem is their better with hair than I am.. and I&#x27;m pretty darn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not enough power to do much of anything.</li>
    <li> I like that the interior can be cleaned, and that the brush doesn&#x27;t rotate (I like doing it myself like a normal brush anyway). I haven&#x27;t found any issues with the switch going from warm to cold easily, but I can see how that might happen over time (right now it&#x27;s pretty stubborn going between the two, but it might loosen since i use those two most often). Anyway, definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> My hair is always flat, but after using this on my hair in stead of blow drying my hair is fuller and bouncier. It&#x27;s easy to use and I love the way it makes my hair look even after a day or two.</li>
    <li> Take the time to practice with this one.  Once you know how to use this tool, its hard to imagine not using it.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> pin not suitable in singapore. spoilt after second use. i just return it back as its so lousy. not sure if other brands is that terrible</li>
    <li> love it, it&#x27;s powerful, easy to use, and I never managed to get my hair so sleek and voluminous somehow, without it. get it!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!! Could not believe how easy it was to style my frizzy hair just like going to the salon for a pricey blowout but at half the price and time!! Left my hair smooth, shiny and full of body. I have shoulder length hair and it took me 10 minutes to style. The only con is after using it, I noticed some of the small bristles had fallen out. I just hope it last for a while.</li>
    <li> Pulled in my hair and made it really frizzy</li>
    <li> Soft bristles, works well for baby fine hair without tearing it out as other brands tend to do.  I don&#x27;t get a lot of volume but anytime I don&#x27;t air dry, the heat tends to smooth and slightly flatten my hair.</li>
    <li> It is practical for travel and easy to use. Not very powerful for my curly thick long hair. I recommend it for short haired women.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the heat to do the job quickly.  It will work ok if your not in a real hurry.</li>
    <li> I love this air brush.  This is actually replacing my old Conair brush.  This John Frieda brush is very sturdy.  I love the way it hugs my hair.  I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it!</li>
    <li> I have lots of thin, very curly hair, so straightening it was a nightmare.  I previously used the hairdryer and round brush, and straightened about once a week or so.  I had never used a product like this, but I bought it on sale to give it a try.  I love it!  I feel that it focuses the drying just to the sections I am trying to straighten, rather than blowing the rest of my hair everywhere.  I feel that this makes my hair smoother, and feels less damaging.  It is a good size to leave a little curl at the end, or to pull it fairly straight.  The reason it doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars, is that 1 yr later, it is starting to do this thing where it seems like it is being turned down a setting while in use.  It does this on its own, at random times.  Maybe it&#x27;s getting to hot and adjusting itself?  This makes me worry that it&#x27;s going to give out on me.  Either way, it continues to work well, and even if it did break, I have liked it enough to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I own or have owned any and all hair tools and this one beats all! Who new I would like a hot air brush??? I ordered another as back up!! Buy this you won&#x27;t regret it!?  Ok update i just saw this online and had to chuckle.  No clue how Amazon thinks my name is ha mae ho haaaa??? Lol. The name is Jennifer.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace my spin brush that stopped spinning. Turns out this one doesn&#x27;t spin like I thought it did, but it works great and tangles less, so, win :)</li>
    <li> The hot air brush shapes and dries my hair and saves time in the styling process. Excellent hand mold form.</li>
    <li> I really like my new hot air brush. Am able to style my hair quickly and effortlessly as opposed to my clumsy attempts with a brush and hair dryer. Gives hair body and bounce without the harsh heat that typically dries out my fine, blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Life saver!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected. My hair is fine, and it did not work</li>
    <li> They were all correct, its too small and takes too long to work on even shoulder length hair. I dont see any shining effect as reported by some.</li>
    <li> works well , does not get entangled in my hair as some similar products do.  Could have a higher heat setting but still gets job done.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and the roller was much too large for the length of my hair. I was very disappointed because it would have made my life easier because of a shoulder problem.  It would have been nice if the advertisement stated the size of the roller. Then I would have known not to order it</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hot air brush!!  I first dry my hair with my regular hair dryer until it&#x27;s about 75% dry, then I use this brush.  It leaves my hair silky and smooth.  It nearly looks like a professional blow out.  I have fine hair that&#x27;s just a little longer than shoulder length.  I find this product lightweight and very easy to use.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have bought numerous hot air brushes over the years. My favorites have been my two Conair brushes (identical), which are extremely hard to find, as the base of the brush is metal and gets hot enough to smooth out my natural curls. That said, I am pleased with the John Frieda brush because the large handle is comfortable to hold. The switch is a little tricky, as others have noted, but if you pay attention when you set the temperature, it works okay. What I particularly like about this brush is the bristles, which tend to give a lot of body to my baby-fine hair. On the other hand, the brush doesn&#x27;t smooth my hair as well as the Conairs. What I usually do is use the Frieda to fluff my hair and the Conair to smooth it out.</li>
    <li> this hairdryer does give you that salon quality hair-like it&#x27;s been professionally blown.  This one doesn&#x27;t rotate like the con air one, but i think it does just as well.  The only down side i think to this is that if you have long thick hair like i do, you will probably need to dry the hair around your scalp with a conventional hairdryer first, because at 500 watts i feel that it&#x27;s kind of weak, &amp; then dry off the rest with this hot air brush.  (the conair spin brush is also 500 watts)</li>
    <li> It handles easily with a lightweight and big rounded brush, and styles quickly and smoothly with no frizz. Best hot air brush I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I liked and kept this as I often thought what I would do if I hurt one hand.  However, it does not spin like I hoped and have seen other products do, so you still have to use it as a brush, which takes some getting use to.  Also, I am use to more heat, which this does not provide.  Saving for a rainy, incapacitated day!</li>
    <li> I am the type of woman that has her hair colored, cut, styled and the next day when I try to do my hair, IT NEVER LOOKS AS GOOD AS THE SALON!!!! I always look half done. I never seem to get it right.  BUT!!! Ladies!! this John Frieda Hot Air Brush has put all those half baked hair dos out the door. I used this item today, and my hair cut style is just beautiful. I am disabled, so using a brush, and hair dryer at same time is very painful. This Hot Air Brush made it painless, easy, and the results are to die for. I just love my hair, for the first time in two years. It is a little heavy, the handle is a little large, but I did ok with it. I looked three times in the mirror just to check it, still love my hair. Spend a little extra, we are worth it.</li>
    <li> I am not coordinated enough to use a round brush and blow dryer so this works great for me. I have naturally curly hair and this helps so much when I want to straighten it.</li>
    <li> love it, works very well, fast and good. better than i expected. would buy again if i needed to. heats fast.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!  I have shoulder length hair that is thick but very baby fine hair....this Air Brush does an incredible job.  Every time I use it someone says how nice my hair looks...even my daughters ask what I was doing different!  Easy to use, hair does not tangle in it at all for me. It&#x27;s not highest powered Air Brush out there, so makes it very easy to use and not burn your hands or hair for that matter either.</li>
    <li> I really did not find that it smoothed and styled and eliminated frizz as stated that it would.  My blow dryer and a round brush did much better, much faster.  It just does not have the power to tame!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair tool I&#x27;ve ever used.  It gives me soft waves, lots of volume. The effects last for days!</li>
    <li> Cannot style my hair without this dryer, the brush size is perfect and gives tons of volume when straightening my hair and my hair is naturally super curly.</li>
    <li> It took longer than my regular blow dryer. Hair seemed smooth at first ( and yes it does make it feel soft), but left ends frizzy . You wouldn&#x27;t know I have a Keratin treatment in at all my the look of my hair now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few stylish brushes and I just recieved this one and it works better than all the others!! I went according to the reviews and was not disappointed!  It straightens/curls my hair so smoothly :)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I hate this item.  It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I partly took it apart, to discover that my shedding hair was to blame. It was my hair that burned. Once removed the dryer worked fine. Still works fine. The hair was impossible to see so I am more vigilant about checking it now, cleaning the hair from the bristles frequently, and using tweezers once in a while to pull from between the slits. Happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 2014&lt;br /&gt;Purchased in June 2013.  Didn&#x27;t use much for a while because my hair was shorter blunt cut and it didn&#x27;t work well with that.  Since my hair grew out long enough, I have used it every day.  Incredible results on my fine, very wavy, frizzy hair.  Made it smooth as silk with plenty of body.  Until this morning when it smoked itself out of existence.  Out of nowhere.  No warning.  I still have a Conair that I have owned for 7-8 years.  I didn&#x27;t like it as well since the bristles were hard and it did not have the same smoothing effect on my hair.  But at least it still works.  Warranty on this was 1 month.  I have to wonder if the manufacturer has a longer one but will have to find the info that came with it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews and watching youtube videos on this product, I was sold! I have owned, and used it, for a couple of weeks now and I can honestly report that it works wonderfully! My hair just &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; healthier and this product has taken a step out of my hair routine!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush when I had hair a few inches past my shoulders. I have a lot of fine hair that is wavy to straightish naturally. I was pretty neutral after my first few uses of this. I was hoping to eliminate the blow dryer round brush juggle that ate up my morning routine. I was not able to get the same kind of volume at my crown that I was looking for and used to and it seemed to take forever to dry each section. I packed it away and shrugged it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I cut my hair into a chin sweeping bob and thought I would give this another shot. HOLY MOLY! Works amazing to give me smooth bouncy swinging voluminous hair. I love what this does. I don&#x27;t even need to flat iron my hair. I am so happy to have found this brush. I think it works great for shorter hair but didn&#x27;t work for my hair when longer. I will keep this for short hairstyles and use a traditional round brush/blow dryer or the InStyler when my hair is longer. Overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it. Soft bristles, but still holds your hair nicely.</li>
    <li> Since I have arthritis it is difficult to hold both a hair dryer and brush at the same time.  This hot air brush solves the problem.  I have had other brands that are o.k. but the size of this brush is large enough to form a soft curl.  It is not as powerful as other brands, which could be a issue if you have really thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a large brush is what you need, this is the tool for you.</li>
    <li> It has made my life so much easier not to have to hold a brush in one hand and hair dryer in another to do a blow out. I have coarse, thick, wavy/curly hair. This brush left it smooth and shiny in a short period of time. It has been especially useful for the back of my head and the bottom near my neck, which has always been the most difficult to blow out. As I&#x27;m getting used to it, I can easily do my hair at the nape of the neck with one hand and it doesn&#x27;t get so hot that I have to worry about burning myself. Also, I&#x27;ve had no problem with the controls on the front, as some reviewers have mentioned.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this item.  Plugged it in and was disappointed.  There is no heat.  How is this thing supposed to dry hair?  My hair got tangled in it and amid the cussing, I was able to get free.  Sorry I did not keep the packaging or I would return it for a refund.</li>
    <li> I was debating weather to buy another hair product since it took me so long to straighten and blow dry my hair I finally gave in. I love all of John Frieda hair products so I thought why not this and I am so glad I did. I have thin, fine hair and this appliance makes my hair soft, shiny, and full (it literally feels like I stepped out of the salon) I would recommend this to all people who have the fine hair type since it is so easy to use. It replaced all the blow drying and straightening. So glad I go this product!</li>
    <li> Handle is to fat for easy handling. I&#x27;m a small women with long fingers. I liked everything else about this. Should probably given four stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hot air brush for a few days and I love it.  It gives me so much more body and manages my unruly, wavy hair perfectly.  I have been drying my hair slightly with a blow dryer then using this to finish. The bristles are flexible and go through my shoulder length, layered, color treated hair easily and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.  No other styling tools needed.</li>
    <li> love this smaller round brush, it really helps for those areas that are too short for my curlers</li>
    <li> If this hot air brush continues to operate as it should, I&#x27;m loving it.  Makes styling my hair so much easier than trying to manipulate a brush and blow dryer separately.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that they tell you to test it each time before you use it.  Seems a bit much.</li>
    <li> Love this item. I was doubtful when I ordered it, but was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I thought this air brush just did not have enough drying power for my hair.  It seemed slow and weak.  I had to return it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product out of desperation when Conair quit making the air brush I had used for years.  I can&#x27;t dry AND style my hair with a blow dryer.  This hot air brush does a great job.  It Is even better than what I had been using.  The only things I would change is to make the handle a little thinner and replace the flat end with something to hold on to.</li>
    <li> This hot air brush does a great job styling my hair.  It is so much easier to use, then my blow dryer and and round brush.</li>
    <li> I use a hot air brush daily to smooth my naturally \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; hair.  I really was looking forward to this larger barrel rather than the smaller one I have.  This also has longer bristles which is better than the short bristles for smoothing frizzy hair.  Sad to say I am very disappointed with this product.  It is sorely under powered.  Barely gets warm and barely blows.  Had to go back to my Revlon hot air brush.  I would not recommend this brush.  Concept is perfect, functionally deficient!</li>
    <li> This is a very very good brush, easy to handle.  Very nice to work with and finish off your style!</li>
    <li> Finally something that actually works. My hair is thin and extremely curly, easily frizzy. I cannot use a blow dryer and the straightening tools tend to burn, the curling irons do not work, my hair goes right through, but this on semi dry hair gives me more volume and a nice wave to the hair. I still need to tame the flyaways with leave on conditioner, but it is much better than the straighteners and so much better than a blow dryer</li>
    <li> Great!!  Rarely do I find a setting tool like this because I have baby fine hair.  Really works for me!  Use it daily!!</li>
    <li> Loveeee this tool for my long hair. I had a ConAir Hot air brush that I liked but broke after 6 mos of use. Since I have a John Frieda hair dryer, decided to buy his hot hair brush too. Woah! it&#x27;s light, looks good, is easy to manage + maneuver, and the plastic teeth grip your hair to make curling effortless. Cuts blow dryer time for 20mns to 10. Worth the $$!</li>
    <li> One of the best hand held round hairdryers I have ever owned. Gets warm quickly thus takes less time to dry my hair into a nice style. It is easy to hold and manuever to create a hair style.</li>
    <li> It takes forever on my thick hair but for most girls I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be great.</li>
    <li> Very cool! First you dry your hair nearly dry, then have fun with this tool. It gives body and shine. You can touch the end to help grab the hair.</li>
    <li> Works great. Good value. Helps reduce the frizzies.</li>
    <li> This is MUCH better than I thought!  I have thick hair, so I still need ti do a quick blow dry with a regular blow dryer, but doing the styling with this makes doing my hair so much easier.  It actually works - air actually blows out of it.  I can do my hair without clumsily trying to hold a dryer and a brush separately</li>
    <li> Great dryer for fine, straight hair</li>
    <li> absolutely love this styling brush/dryer. It has made styling my hair so  easy.  No more fighting with the round brush and blow dryer.  One valuable tip I&#x27;ve found is to blow your hair 90% dry and then use the John Frieda air brush to complete your style.  I will not be without it again!!  I have short hair (just to bottom of ears).  I got the 1.5inch brush and it works wonderful!</li>
    <li> Nice product and shipping!</li>
    <li> Excellent product very pleased actually own two in different voltage one for USA and one for UK</li>
    <li> works fine.  although i preferred the one i had that finally wore out, this one does the job.</li>
    <li> I love this and use it everyday. If you&#x27;re good with a round brush and a hair dryer, you can adapt easily to this. It&#x27;s even a little easier because you have one hand free. It dries and styles  my medium-long hair well, although to be honest, if you&#x27;re in a big hurry, use a hair dryer to get rid of some of water first.  It takes a while if your hair is dripping wet.</li>
    <li> Perfect for thick  curly almost course hair. The best product I&#x27;ve found so far to tame the hair!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful tool!</li>
    <li> Absolutely hate it.  The bristles fall out and if I could return it, I wood.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Brush I use it almost every day, it does not burn my hair and I received so many complement on how my hair looks. This is a product that I will buy ove and over.</li>
    <li> This is really a smoothing tool. I had an old Conair that worked to finish drying and styling at the same time with some curl.  It&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;ll give it to my mom who has much thinner hair.</li>
    <li> I realized that what I like about haircuts is not the haircut, but the soft and good looking hair.  This Air Brush is the best thing in hair products that has ever happened to me! :) I have very long, very coarse hair. So, I wash it and let it partially dry and then use the Air Brush. My hair looks as close to being out of hair salon as it gets. It does take time - but so so so much more manageable than with a air dryer or any other methods. LOVE the product. If this one breaks - I&#x27;m buying another one.</li>
    <li> I like the product, however, there are no replacements for the brush.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, fine, gray/brown (50/50), and curly. I purchased this product because of the great reviews here and on YouTube. I also have the Conair Infiniti Pro Hot Air, which sells at a similar price point and the Instyler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro&#x27;s: It dries my hair quickly (as long as I allow my hair to dry at least 50% ahead of time), and straightens. Also, the price is very good, compared to the Instyler, which is expensive and very drying to the hair (too drying, in my opinion, to use daily/regularly). The John Frieda has high heat, but not scorching, which works very well for straightening curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;The Con&#x27;s: It gives my hair &amp;#34;static&amp;#34; and leaves my fine hair kind of &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34;. It does such a great job of straightening, it leaves it a little too straight/without body. I live in L.A. and the air is dry, which may contribute to the static as well, although I don&#x27;t get it with the other dryers.  I think that if I tinted my hair, it would be perfect for me (not doing it though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: I recommend it! I continue to use this hot air brush, and alternate with the Conair, which is better at giving me &amp;#34;body&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Extremely easy to use. Very pleased with this!!!</li>
    <li> Have many of these types but this works wonderful.  Drys hair fast and helps keep hair straight. I have very curly, thick, corse, hair and have it straightened.  This helps the straightening last longer and helps me to style like my hair stylist</li>
    <li> It works very well!&lt;br /&gt;I have a fine hair and it is more than enough to give me a great look!&lt;br /&gt;I spend less time using this brush than using a dryer more a regular brush and it is so light!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to organize the cord and keep it in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy and recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use instead of blow dryer, hot isn&#x27;t too hot, so i dont feel like its very damaging to my hair, i have butt-length hair and this is much easier than using a blow dryer, for styling purposes wish the hot could get a little hotter</li>
    <li> I am the first to admit that I hate my fine hair and I completely hate blow drying it.  Add in a new baby and I generally leave the house with wet hair and then throw it up in a ponytail at some point during the day.  This hot air brush makes all the difference.  I let my hair mostly air dry and then I run this through my hair in sections.  I don&#x27;t know that I am getting a ton of volume from this, like the other users mentioned but I am going to blame that on the operator and not on the brush.  I will say that my hair is really smooth and shiny and has a pretty flick at the ends.  I think this is totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I had a hot air brush for years and went to replace it I looked up reviews and this had good reviews, I am so surprised at this product, takes three times longer then my cheaper older one that was used by 2 with long hair!  Not at all what I expected to get from this name.</li>
    <li> This is the best styling tool I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Worked so well I ended up buying three more as gifts for family members who were also styling challenged!  They also love to use when styling their little girls hair because now they can avoid the hot spots that hair dryers can cause.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair smooth, silky, soft, and frizze free.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It was no good.  I felt it nothing for my hair.  It did not get hot enough.,</li>
    <li> This is the best hot air brush I have used. IT has both hard and soft bristles to get the hair silky smooth and straight. After using this I have no frizz, and my hair is very soft. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to blow dry and smooth/straighten their hair at the same time. Straight, curly or kinky hair, this is perfect to blow dry straight and soft.</li>
    <li> Best hair styler I have ever owned and I&#x27;ve tried many.  I heard about the John Frieda and decided to give it a try.  So glad I did!  I get a blow out style that is incredibly close to what I get at a salon.  I didn&#x27;t think it was possible, but this product does it.</li>
    <li> I like that this airbrush has a large barrel and the bristles are just the right length to grab and curl your hair easily.  The only negative comment is the power.  If it had just a little more of it this airbrush would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I have medium length, medium thick, wavy hair and bought this tool as a way to simplify my morning hair routine.  Just like with any new beauty product, there is a learning curve with this one and it took me a few weeks to figure out how to get the hot air brush to work well with my hair.  Expect to have to play around with it in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a few weeks, I can say that it&#x27;s not going to work for most people as a hair dryer.  I start with it only once my hair has mostly air dried and is just EVER so slightly damp.  It takes me about 20 minutes to complete my whole head, which is more than twice as long as I can get from wet to totally dry and styled with a hair dryer.  The effect when I&#x27;m done, however, is much better than if I try using a round brush and hair dryer together.  I guess I&#x27;m just not that coordinated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend who saw me immediately after using this told me I had &amp;#34;model hair.&amp;#34;  That&#x27;s compliment enough for me to continue using this for a long time :)</li>
    <li> Good product. I like how it cuts down my time flat ironing my hair.  The bristles are good and goes right through my hair.  I wish the brush portion was bigger though.  The top end of the brush gets really hot, so be careful not to touch it when drying your hair.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this.....have to buy another</li>
    <li> have arthritis and it is big and bulky, does a great job but have to stop and start several times because it  has such a &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; handle to hold on it.</li>
    <li> Straightforward, easy to hold and manipulate.  Hot setting is quite hot.  Gets my frizzy hair under control, gives me gentle waves.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I bough this item past September and few days ago (6 months later) it broke. Started to smell weird and then stopped working at all. I have seen few reviews warning about the same problem and did not believe. NOW I do.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love how my hair looks blown out every time I use this. Only wish it rotated.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work with my straight short hair like I anticipated it would.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to purchase this product.  My main concern is how hot the tip of the brush gets when you are using it.  This is not good for your safety.  Otherwise, I use the brush and just make sure to be aware of the hot tip.  I would purchase a different product that does not burn your finger next time I need a hot air brush.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush.  I have had several and this one is the best.  It smooths my hair and does not dry it out,</li>
    <li> I recently suffered a broken wrist and even though it was not my primary use hand you can imagine styling hair was still a huge challenge. This air brush made such a difference, people noted how good my hair looked, shiny, smooth, well styled for one handed! I will NEVER revert back to brush AND blow dryer as long as these are on the market!</li>
    <li> To big in the picture it looks small and that is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair shiny and with just enough curl to look natural. It does not heat to over dry which takes the oils out. Perfect for all occasions.</li>
    <li> I bought this over 6 months ago; I have fine to medium thick hair, past my shoulders. I&#x27;m not great at blow-drying my hair and always found it difficult to blow out my long layers,especially around my face. This brush has made an unbelievable difference. Most days, I dry my hair about 80%, upside down first with a blow dryer. I then section off the top/crown part of my hair and use a blow-dryer and big round brush to blow out and smooth the rest of my hair. I then use the hot air brush to do the top and front of my hair. I went on youtube to get instructions on how to blow dry hair and use these to do the top with the hot air brush, instead of a regular brush. Nothing difficult. Just get a section and roll it around the hot air brush. I use heat for about 1 minute then another 30 seconds of cold air. It turns out really well! When I have more time, I use this brush to dry all my hair, section by section. I then use a small amount of John Frieda frizz-ease smoothing cream and it looks amazing.Bouncy and wavy but not curly. I&#x27;d give this 5 stars but the only drawback was the motor burned out after 6 months. I tried another hot brush..not even close to this quality and returned it. I contacted Conair who replaced the hot air brush, no problem. You won&#x27;t regret buying this, it&#x27;s changed my life, seriously.</li>
    <li> The hot air brush does a nice job of smoothing out my hair.  But, I have somewhat thick fine hair and it takes a very long time to actually dry my hair.  I find myself using a more powerful blow dryer to start and finish with the hot air brush.  I need both dryers to accomplish drying and smoothing out my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a good styling dryer, but it IS NOT a good hair dryer.  It will not replace your standard hair dryer.  You need to have your hair mostly dry or it will take you forever (unless you have VERY short hair).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s little big for me.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I have a chin length stacked bob and naturally curly hair.  I was using a round brush with a hair dryer followed by a large diameter curling iron to get my hair straight.  Now I just add product, wait 5 minutes for my hair to dry slightly, then use this air brush.  I&#x27;ve easily cut 10 minutes off of my hair routine AND my hair looks sleeker and more finished than with my previous routine.  Yay!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> good quality and a lot cheaper than the TV ads&lt;br /&gt;i have recommended it already to friends and clients im a hairdresser</li>
    <li> This hot air brush does the job for longer hair.  It gives you a very slight curl.  I have only been able to use it successfully for turning my hair under, since the barrel is quite large.  I probably would order a size down from this one, if I had it to do over.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time.  Really makes styling easy.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that is wavy at best but defiantly not straight.  I tried this on my hair and it kept getting tangled. This might work great for others but not for me.</li>
    <li> This brush is great, it is easy to handle and you are drying your hair and styling it at the same time. So glad I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap!!! Not at all as described. Hard to use and no air. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone ever</li>
    <li> Absolutely, love this product.  The bristles are so soft not like those hard plastic ones. My hair is fine, so it&#x27;s dry in a few minutes with this air brush and it doesn&#x27;t burn your hair.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> if you are looking for a straighter style this is not the one for you. This is Ok for touch-ups only.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and a fast styling option.  The output of heat is relatively low, so I dry my hair with a regular blow dryer to the point its mostly dry, and use this product to finish styling and set my hair each morning.  Much easier then using a round brush, but doesn&#x27;t give you the big curls that a round brush and blow dryer will give, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> No complaints.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with this purchase. Was not expecting much but found the bristles soft yet perfect for styling. Would def. order again.</li>
    <li> this brush is great - id been having trouble finishing off drying my hair especially at the bottoms so I would never fully dry it. The brush has three different settings but keep in mind that even the highest setting will not dry your hair well unless you&#x27;ve already gotten most of the moisture out with a normal blow dryer. I have thin hair and if I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer first it&#x27;ll take forever to dry my hair with this brush. However, this drying brush is a perfect way to finish up the drying process.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my shoulder length fine hair.tried it a few times to see if I needed to get used to the drier. It does not hold the shape for me.didnt do much even with the styling products. It left my hair frizzed than ever!!The bristles are flimsy. I bought it becaus of the great reviews.  Very disappointed. Tried to return it and the seller tells me I will have to pay 15% restocking fee and pay for return shipping for the product myself. Not happy. Guess I will be leaving this as a back up in my bottom drawer just because!</li>
    <li> In full disclosure, I returned this item.  I used a similar brush/curler years ago and loved it.  I used this one multiple times to make sure I had given it a fair shot.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  It was a lot of effort without much reward.  My hair didn&#x27;t look any better than when I just dried it with a brush and hair dryer.  And it took forever.  This might work for some hair types, but for my long, fine, thin hair this was not worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Makes hair straight and styles good for a bob cut</li>
    <li> Too  big and only 1.5, should have ordered the 1&amp;#34;, but gave it away as Christmas gift, too wary to order the 1&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Purchase this to style your hair if you are a really talented amateur or a hair professional.  It is NOT a hair dryer in any sense of the word.  Even with my fine I had to blow dry then use this.  Even though it was extremely time consuming I would have happily done so if the results had been worth it....they were not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide give it a go best of luck!</li>
    <li> I was excited to buy this as soon as I saw it in a magazine. I have very fine, thin hair that I have never been good at styling. I hate trying to style it with a round brush and hairdryer using 2 hands because it just never looks as good as when the stylist does it (plus I start to get arm aches). So on most days my hair does whatever it wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, for me this product is amazing! Yes, it is only 500 watts (in comparison my hair dryer is 1875w). I have just been towel drying my hair, getting a few morning tasks done, and then styling it when it is not soaking wet. My hair looks sleek, soft, and I can actually make it look good! I don&#x27;t feel that it takes any longer to dry then than using my hair dryer and a round brush - and my my hair looks a whole lot better. I can even style the back of my hair. I&#x27;m so lazy, I usually give up before I get to the back. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so very pleased with this. I like it so much, I&#x27;m buying one for my mom who has the same kind of hair. I&#x27;m not sure this would work as well on super thick hair, though, so that would be something to take into consideration.</li>
    <li> I love it!! This is my favorite hairstyling tool I have ever owned!! I have a soft perm. I use this and my hair looks amazing!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My hair has never felt so soft and looked so shiny before. It&#x27;s amazing. Definitely recommend for people with medium to thin thickness of hair. Don&#x27;t know how it would work on super curly hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted a replacement for the ConAir airbrush that kept breaking.  This works fine and I like having the permanent brush. The handle is thicker and for some reason doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well on my short hair. The barrel might be a little bigger - reason why.</li>
    <li> Sort of disappointing but I kept it.  The buttons are difficult to use like someone else said.  Doesn&#x27;t really give me the volume that I wanted.</li>
    <li> This brush not only dries hair, but it also gives body, smooths and soften the tresses.  Having long hair is a challenge, but even with hair past my shoulders, the brush worked fabulously</li>
    <li> I read reviews about folks having issues with long hair, mine is shorter and fine. For my hair its great! I use it to finish drying and styling. If your hair is soaking wet or long and thick I&#x27;d suggest drying mostly with a regular hair dryer and then use this as a finishing or styling brush.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS AIR BRUSH!!  I&#x27;ve been using a curling brush with hard plastic tines for some time, but it is intended for styling and curling only.  The John Frieda Hot Air Brush not only styles my hair, it dries my hair, too!!  I use a root-lifting gel or mousse and dry my hair on high heat one small section at a time, producing volume, then switch to low heat to curl.  Really easy to use!!</li>
    <li> I have had many brush dryers in the past but the ones i had had a metal centernof the brush and it heated up so much it would dry out my ends and my hair would break off. This be doesn&#x27;t have that dangerous, damaging plate so it soothed out my hair without drying out my hair. I did let my hair dry a bit and then blow dryed it a bit and then used it to shape the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered on Sat. And received the dryer today, Monday. Wonderful quick delivery. Great service.</li>
    <li> This is a great air brush and makes my hair so soft and manageable.  I was disappointed it only had one size brush as I have short hair and need a smaller brush.  I plan to call the company and see if a smaller brush is available. If you have long hair, you will love it.</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;This thing hardly adds any body to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair takes shape well and I can not get this to shape my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product takes forever to dry my hair, from damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quiet&lt;br /&gt;Gets at the roots!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The cool setting is pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Use your normal blow dryer and then finnish it up with this.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer/brush is amazing. You only use it when your hair is already about 80% dry. It looks like I got a blowout when I use it.</li>
    <li> I incorrectly purchased this thinking it was something different.  I did not realize the mistake until I took it out of the box and had tested it...thus making it impossible to return it.  It wasn&#x27;t an ideal situation, I don&#x27;t use the hot air brush and can&#x27;t return it and haven&#x27;t thrown it away or given it away as it&#x27;s virtually new,</li>
    <li> My hair is short and think the brush is too big for what I was hoping to use it for.</li>
    <li> I usually blow dry and then straighten my long hair so I bought this to try instead.  It makes my hair super smooth and does a great job but it takes a long time.  It actually takes longer then blow drying with my blow dryer and then straightening with my straightener.  I&#x27;m still using it for now but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually a better alternative.</li>
    <li> This hot air brush is good, but I do wish it rotated.  Dries my hair fairly rapidly; however I do get my hair 3/4 dry before styling.  Does not give much curl at all, but does finish drying my thick hair well.  I use it this way:  slightly wet strands of hair, curl and dry; then I spray the strand and dry the sprayed hair.  I would not purchase again because it doesn&#x27;t rotate to get the wavy/curl I want.  Ordered new; packaging was well done; seller is 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is the third one I have bought and it is the best thing EVER!  I have very curly hair and have a difficult time drying the very back of my hair into anything that resembles smooth!  This is the answer!!  My grandaughter&#x27;s hair is the same and she loves hers, as well.  Very easy to use and very quick to dry/smooth ones hair.</li>
    <li> This is by far the absolute best hot air brush I have ever used.  I have been using hot air brushes for years because I am not good with the blow dryer and round brush...just couldn&#x27;t get that to work for me.  Well, after using this just one time, I am sold.  It looks like I have been to a salon and had my hair styled with the round brush and blow dryer.  This is worth every penny.  I so wish I had found this years ago.  This is a must have.</li>
    <li> A little bit about my hair: I have naturally blond, long, and straight hair. It is fine and fragile but I have lots of it. I usually can&#x27;t get any volume on it, no matter if I air dry it, or blow dry it. Honestly, they even struggle with it  in salon. In addition to that, I have a round face which begs for hair around it to have volume, - it looks very round and boring otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other reviewer mentioned - I have never grasped a technique of using hair dryer and a round brush: heavy, uncomfortable and not a good result. I used to own a different brand hot air brush before, but it would tangle my hair severely and I hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research, I have finally purchased Conair 276R Infinite Pro Volume dryer, John Frieda Luxurious Volume Lavish Lift Root Booster and this hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine: I first spray towel dried hair with the Root Booster, then I dry my hair upside down with the Pro Volume dryer (not to completely dry) and finally I use this brush to shape and style the hair. The reason I use a regular dryer first is because, as I mentioned before, I do have a lot of hair and it would take forever to dry with just the brush. The whole process is easy and doesn&#x27;t take a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks so pretty now, just like after a good salon styling. I even got compliments from a female coworker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just perfect, works excellent my hair looks amazing, i love i... like all products of John Frieda this is perfect</li>
    <li> When I took it out of the box I didn&#x27;t realize the brush was so big but after trying it out I realized how it was just perfect for my hair. I don&#x27;t think I could do without it now.</li>
    <li> Due to extremely dry hair, I wash mine every other day.  On the off day I use the hot air brush to style my hair.  It looks almost as good as the day it is washed.  Would definitely recommend.  Probably would work best on short hair.  Mine is about chin length.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and always seem to be in a hurry to get it styled and ready to get to work.  This fits the bill to a T.  There are 3 settings; high and low heat as well as cool air also.  Gets the job done fast, doesn&#x27;t damage my fine hair either.  To clean it I simply run a dampened, stiff nail brush through the bristles, removing hair and styling residue.  I once cleaned it a bit more thoroughly by using a very wet nailbrush and two drops of shampoo; brushed it through the bristles, then rinsed it running the wet, soap-free nail brush through the bristles several times.  I allowed it to dry thoroughly, plugged it in and voila!  Not only did it work great, it was clean as a whistle.  Too bad there isn&#x27;t a better way of taking this apart to clean it completely without damage to the electrical source.</li>
    <li> I wish it was more powerful, it would it take less time to do my hair. Other than that, great product.</li>
    <li> Sometimes you just want to call all your girlfriends and tell them to try something good....this is one of those time! Get this one!&lt;br /&gt;(it has the switch issue others mention here...but just pay attention and you&#x27;ll be fine)</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is best hair style product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Throw out your hot rollers, curling irons &amp; flat irons. I have  very thick straight hair with some wavy kinks in the back making blowing out and styling my hair a laborious chore.  With the John Frieda shaper, my hair looks professionally blown out, and it&#x27;s so fast and easy! I simply blow dry my hair with my regular blow dryer until its almost dry, then style with the John Freida using  one hand! It&#x27;s  perfect every time. - no more awkward attempts using a round brush with one hand, and blow dryer with my other hand.</li>
    <li> Really works well. I only wish it were more powerful.  Ladies with thick hair may not find it efficient, though.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and unfortunately this didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I was very upset because it seemed like a great idea. I gave it to  my mom because she short hair and she has hard time using the handle. So, it&#x27;s not the best if you have long or thick hair because it can take forever to style.</li>
    <li> This is a great product  easy to use and delivers great results. Performs very well to straighten curly hair, easy way to get extra body</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase. I have the type of hair that if left to dry on it&#x27;s own is a wavy-ish frizz mess. With this I either let it air dry 85% or do a messy blow dry until that point and then use this. Afterwards I do use my straightener a bit. The difference I&#x27;ve noticed since using it, is that my hair has more overall lift from the roots and the bottom can curl in or out as I want it. Previously, I was using a large round brush. I haven&#x27;t tried a rotating drying brush, but honestly, this is so easy and my hair has never tangled so I don&#x27;t see a reason to.</li>
    <li> I just got a new bob haircut and this thing works like a charm! the air is hot enough to give volume and jut product itself isn&#x27;t too heavy to hold for extended period of time (no bye bye arm workout here). Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Great Product. This product is fantastic! I love how it leaves my hair. Really shiny and tame. Grant it I have to use the flattening iron afterwards but my other hot air brush never gave me the flare this one gives me. It really leaves my hair &amp;#34;bouncy&amp;#34;. The reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because it does not have a cool tip and this little guy can heat up pretty hot and my fingers don&#x27;t like that! Overall a very nice product. I am happy with it. - Shelly</li>
    <li> Having straight hair can at times be challenging. This is perfect for blowing drying and saving your arms. I love that I can now style my hair with one hand. No more brush and blow dryer separate. It is not only saving time but it keeps me from loosing feeling in my hands.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool, it grabs my hair without pulling or ripping and holds it in the brush without slipping out or having to use my hand to guide it.  LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The one end gets hot and it would be better if the handle had a rubber grip instead of a smooth surface.  It tends to slip through my hand at times.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I have ever owned. Easy to use, leaves hair shiny and smooth. One of the best beauty investments I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> Great product....works well and my short hair.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, EVEN BETTER PRICE!</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve used this hot air brush only once, but I can tell it&#x27;s going to be my BFF for years to come.  I have long-ish (below my shoulders) fine but thick hair.  Unlike some reviewers, I have long since mastered the blow drier + round brush combo.  But, the problems that I&#x27;ve experienced with that method are: using both arms, above the head and for extended periods, is painful/ labor intensive/ exhausting; it takes a long time; and it&#x27;s hot as bloody hell.  And frankly, the results aren&#x27;t great with long hair.  When I had a rounded bob, it was perfect, but since my hair has gotten longer, it&#x27;s just meh.  But this hot air brush it different.  This is quick, you can do it one-handed, and I didn&#x27;t even break a sweat, literally.  My hair looks shiny and curled.  In short, I love it.</li>
    <li> Straightens my hair great.  Don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it.</li>
    <li> gives hair body without curl and my hair is very fine so I love the body it gives me</li>
    <li> Okay so I love this concept, was much easier to hold than a traditional dryer but took at least 5 years of my life that I&#x27;ll never get back even after blowdrying to 90% dry with another blowdryer before. Returned and will be getting the babyliss in its place.</li>
    <li> Great dryer! Easy to use. Wish the brush was a little smaller.</li>
    <li> I have long and fine curly hair, and for me this is much easier and faster than using a blowdryer and rounded brush. I towel dry, then let my hair air dry for about 20 minutes, apply a volume/shine/heat protectant serum (currently Garnier&#x27;s discontinued Root Booster) and then use the hot air brush (on low). Great results and no tangling. Then I add a bit of Aveda&#x27;s Light Elements Smoothing Fluid and do a quick (5-minute) touch up with my flat iron. Very easy and I love the results (shine, body, volume, very little frizz). I also love that it weighs next to nothing. :)</li>
    <li> I love my new hair brush!  It is easy to use and styles my hair easily!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product was just okay! It&#x27;s pretty much a brush that has a built in blowdryer. Skip this one and purchase the Infiniti Pro by Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler instead. Soooo much better and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> makes hair smooth....easy to use</li>
    <li> I always had trouble blow drying my own hair but with this dryer its soooo easy and looks like I just walked out of the salon.  My hair is straight  and chin length.  The blower gives it volume lift and a very slight curl.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this because I thought that since I have fine, thin hair it would work well, but it seems to be more effort to get my hair the way I like it with this then using a round brush and my hair dryer. I never really use this.</li>
    <li> Love it. So easy to use. Can&#x27;t be without it now.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this air brush works great for me.  It has multiple settings (High heat, low heat, and cool), does what it advertised for. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This does it all for me....dries, smoothes, bodifies your hair all in one step.  However, I predry with a blow dryer leaving it damp.  It&#x27;s faster.  I have thin fine  hair and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter was visiting, used it and asked for the link from Amazon so she could purchase one!  She has thick, coarse hair.  She was impressed how it straightens without flattening the hair as would a flat iron.  This allows you body and volume.</li>
    <li> I have used other hot air brushes but this is the best so far. I have moderately frizzy hair and this is my salvation. I have been using it for about a month now and I have reduced the need for leave-in products as well which is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It is a good product for hair that is dry.  There is no way to dry your hair with this product it you have thick curly hair-you will need a high poweded blow dryer and round brush.  If this product could be made with more power it world be perfect.  It is wonderful to touch up tool for te days you did not wash your hair.</li>
    <li> This is indeed an awesome tool !&lt;br /&gt;At first I was hesitating a little because my decision to buy it was based solely on many great/good reviews. The reality though proved that this Hot Air Brush is just the best tool I ever had. I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time doing my hair and with this brush it doesn&#x27;t take me more than 15-20 min and its done. The air doesn&#x27;t scold or burn my skin and really leaves hair smooth and silky. Another plus is the price ( I happened to compare a couple of other brands )  and this is NOT the most expensive one on the market -on the contrary.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hot air brush broke last year and I couldn&#x27;t replace it with the exact model I had. I tried one from another company that I had to replace 2x because the barrel kept cracking. The Frieda is awesome! Easy to use, solid, I absolutely love it. The size of the barrel is perfect. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it.</li>
    <li> I like the power it has. I have older brushes that have much lower power. I use it to shape my hair after blowing it dry.</li>
    <li> I really liked this hot air brush. I bought the helen of troy and the conair one that comes with two other brush heads, and I preferred this one over the others. My ears are sensitive and the conair had a loud, high pitch noise and a very short chord that was annoying to work with. The helen of troy was poorly made, but it did style better than the john Frieda and I think that may be because it let out hotter air and has a smaller diameter brush.&lt;br /&gt;The John Frieda basically replaces the traditional hair dryer. Makes it much better on my arms and is more efficient. I had a hard time styling, but it does the job of a blow dryer AFTER towel drying really well. Basically, it&#x27;s like brow drying with that a round brush that is the same size. If you already do that, then this will be easy for you. If not, like me, it might take a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;If they do come out with a new one, I hope they come out with two, one that is this size and one that is smaller, and maybe has hotter air.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what possessed me to consider buying this item, I have a very expensive blow drier that works just fine, but based on the reviews here and on some of my favorite bloggers sites, I was intrigued. The price point was low enough that I figured if it didn&#x27;t work well enough, I&#x27;d keep it as a back up in the guest bath. I chose this particular one over others mainly because of the brand and the sleek look. It&#x27;s very light, so light that I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work good enough. Once I turned it on, the air felt so weak that I thought there&#x27;d be no way for it get my thick, sopping hair dry. I picked a small section of hair and rolled my hair around the ends a few times and realized it was working! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! It cuts my hair drying time almost in half because there&#x27;s no fussing with holding the blow drier and the brush at the same time. You have a lot more control over the sections and it makes it so much easier to get volume at the top and curl the ends nicely at the bottom. Since purchasing, I have not used my traditional blow drier at all. I will say that this hot air brush is only good if you want to do your hair straight or with the ends flipped up, you can&#x27;t really use it to blow the cold out of your hair or anything, so you&#x27;ll still need a traditional blow drier if you want to just blow air through your hair. This is absolutely the perfect tool to get your hair looking like a salon style blow out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both Revlon &amp; Conair in the past (the two with removable heads) and every time my hair would end up tangled and pieces would get broke.  I love that the brush on this one does NOT rotate. It is PERFECT and not ONE tangled hair!!! I love this and have already recommended it to others!</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and drys frizzy and wavy.  The John Frieda air brush helps to straighten the waves and dents, but doesn&#x27;t help a lot with my frizz.  I think it was a good value; have only used it about 4 times so far. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST AIR BRUSH I HAVE EVER OWNED.</li>
    <li> Having one of these hair dryers gives me a salon finish - I&#x27;m saving loads of money on blow-outs at the hairdressers. Great product. Gives silky, shiny finish.</li>
    <li> this brush built up so much static (regardless of what steps I took) I ended up throwing in the back of the &amp;#34;hair stuff reject&amp;#34; drawer.</li>
    <li> I thought the brush would spin.  I have short fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Don&#x27;t bother buying it.  It&#x27;s not as good as holding your own brush and blow dryer.  If I didn&#x27;t try it .............I would have sent it back.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift. So far it&#x27;s working great for her. The brushes are a little longer than ConAir brush so it feels like it may be flimsy but perhaps that&#x27;s what makes it better.</li>
    <li> I never had the patience or coordination to hold a brush in one hand and blow dryer in the other to style my hair, so I was happily surprised to read somewhere (allure.com?) on the Net about this invention. Previous reviews on Amazon indicated that this was a great product (and easier on your hair than a less-expensive aluminum type) and I&#x27;m pleased to confirm those reports. Styling my hair is fun w/this new toy!</li>
    <li> For years I had tried different shampoos/conditioners to try to replicate that shiny, silky hair that I walked away from the salon with -- all to no avail!  When I blow dried my hair with my dryer and round brush, I ended up with a frizzy, straw-like mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As arthritis is making it more difficult to hold the dryer in my left hand, I went on a search for something that would help and I came across this John Freida Hot Air Brush.  Not only is it a wonderful help for my arthritic left hand -- but now, when I blow dry my hair, it looks like I had it done at the salon!  It is shiny and silky and no longer looks like straw -- and all this from a hot air brush!  I am absolutely blown away (pardon the pun!)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even tried using different kinds of shampoo (since I have so many from my search for that shiny, supple hair), but it still comes out beautifully every time.  I will tell you that I use a little Redken Outshine 01 before I blow dry it -- but I was using that when it turned out as a frizzy mess, too!  PLEASE NOTE:  I wash my hair, towel dry it, comb it out and then put on my make-up before blow drying my hair.  I also section it off using one of those larger claw clips, starting at the base of my neck and dry it in sections like they do at the salon.  It does take a little longer than my old way of doing it -- but the results are MORE than worth a few extra minutes, in my humble opinion.  Hope this helps in your search!</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick and arrived without damage.  Only negative would be the switch ~ it&#x27;s tricky to get it to &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; but after you figure it out it&#x27;s not a problem.  I have a lot of thin hair with a slight wave and I wear it long.  Sometimes I blow it dry ~ mostly I let it air dry and when it&#x27;s almost dry, I use the John Frieda Air Brush to smooth my hair overall and it does a great job with curling under or flipping the ends.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold as well.  Price well.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I color my hair, bleach mostly every 4 wks and  i have  very  coarse, thick curly  hair. It makes my hair so soft and could  Actually use this without a straightener if i wasnt in florida with so much humidity!  Love john freida products. This is by far the best hot air brush ive ever used and  ive used  many.</li>
    <li> The is a great Hot air brush. the barrel is small enough that I can use it on my short hair.  I have actually ordered a second one.  I had to return the Baby Bliss air brush that I ordered only because the barrel was too large for short hair.  So I knew this one would work and therefore ordered a second one to be used for both drying hair and touch up blow dry when my hair is dry.  I have naturally curly hair and a cowlick in back of head and this hot air brush works well for both of those issues.</li>
    <li> Love this, works better than anything I had used.for styling my naturally curly hsir, easy to use, just the right size.</li>
    <li> I am not coordinated enough to manipulate a brush and dryer. This tool gets the same results with ease of use!</li>
    <li> The brush is easy to handle and gives your hair a smooth shiny finish.  I love the fact that I can towel dry my hair and wait until it&#x27;s almost dry to use the hot air brush.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This item has a grate handle but it does not get hot enough I would not Recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to find a Brush with A higher voltage.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer!  I have thick coarse hair and it significantly speeds up my drying time!</li>
    <li> Glad I read the reviews ahead of time. Mostly dried my hair before using. Finished drying with this. Easy to use, nice long cord for my long hair. First use, a number of the bristles came out. Second use I was less vigorous and none came out. With practice, I think this will be great for my hair. Ready to give up on the hot rollers. Thank you for developing this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been coordinated enough to manage a blow dryer and a brush at the same time, so this product was perfect for me!  So easy to use that even on my first time trying I had amazingly smooth, soft, salon-style hair.  I wish I&#x27;d discovered this trick years ago.</li>
    <li> I bought the brush thinking it will be easier to blow dry but it is lot of work and i dont have that much time.</li>
    <li> This is the best hot air brush I have ever used.  Easy to handle and heat selection is very good.</li>
    <li> Excellent, easy to use, and does wonders for the hair.</li>
    <li> I found it a nuisance to use and didn&#x27;t like the feel of the heat on my hair or head.  I&#x27;m not using it any more.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. If you have thick, wavy and frizzy hair then this brush is not for you.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for people with thin to meduim hair.  The product is great but for anyone with thick hair it might take too long to dry.  The dryer is very light weight and also has several settings.  I take it when I travel.  Hair does not get tangled in it.  I&#x27;ve used several similar products and recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Hot Air Brush about 6 months ago based on reviews from Amazon.  I do like it, the amount of air and heat when the unit is on high does a nice finishing job and adds body.  I wouldn&#x27;t use to totally dry my hair, as it would take too long.  The barrel is quite large, so using on short hair may be difficult.  It is difficult to find hot air brushes, previously i used a ceramic Revlon model that was ionic.  That brush kept the static out of my hair better, but overall, I like this brush better.</li>
    <li> If you have over an hour to blow-dry your hair then perhaps this product will suit you. The power is way too weak. I can see this working for someone with VERY thin hair but otherwise it&#x27;s not a good blow-dryer.</li>
    <li> Best drying brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> The brush is large and it creates a smooth set look. Love the versatality, you do not need two pieces, one comb and one blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time. I&#x27;ve used this once, and within 5 minutes I had my regular blow-dryer aiming at it to speed up the drying time. I then realized this would be much easier to accomplish with the round brush I&#x27;ve been using all along!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003ZX9GJ0 Professional Hair Brush,High Quality Round Bamboo Wood (Phyllostachys Pubescens) Handle with Pure Wild Boar Bristle and Massage Tip Bristle Combination ,Beautiful Natural Bamboo Wood ,w/Canvas Bag, Easy to Hold and Easy Brush Your Hair.,70mm W x 250mm L...]]</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s advertisement led me to believe that I would only need this one tool.  Not true for my hair.  You must still blow dry up to a certain point.  Then use this.  Then I still have to use a flat iron for the sleek look I want.  I did get better with practice, and the one thing I like is the lift from the crown that I&#x27;m able to achieve with this and more fullness overall.  I also think it might cut down slightly on the total amount of time to style, but now I use three tools - for a slightly improved look.</li>
    <li> In 2012, Initially I purchased this for a wedding in Ireland and I wanted to reduce packing. I have thick wavy hair and this is perfect for me. Do I need to section my hair to style it? Well yes, because it is very thick. The end result is no frizz, only as straight / curly as I want it, shiny hair. Because this is a 2 in 1 tool it saves time overall. With a standard blow dryer and brush I still have to use a curling iron to get the look I like. I will buy another after this one dies. September 2016, dropped it at least 20 times, still works great!!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I really like the cool setting to end things and set the hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair that has never been very cooperative.  When it&#x27;s long, it is nice and curly but dry so I usually keep it short but that doesn&#x27;t do much for it and it&#x27;s flat and boring.  I purchased this after seeing one on T.V. and figured I was only out 30 bucks if I didn&#x27;t like it.  I have to say, my hair has never looked better!  I can quickly and easily style my hair with this and after a little practice, it works like a charm to give volume, shine, and style. I tell my husband that I have \\&quot;newscaster hair\\&quot; lol.  My friend has course, thick, curly hair that is shoulder length and she has one but she hasn&#x27;t had as much success with hers.  I have a flat iron and this styles so much better than that.  The flat iron leaves my hair too flat and frizzy at the ends.  This give my hair a nice flip to it and it&#x27;s so easy to get volume at the roots.  If my mom was alive today, she would have LOVED one of these!  She used curlers to get this look and that would take hours.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> so I bought mine and loved it. Been using it for over 6 months now and then tried it on my older sister ... She loved it and bought one... Then I bought another for my other sister. Much cheaper here than at CVS ($46).</li>
    <li> I love this product! It saves me so much time. I use 1 piece of equipment instead of 2. It replaces my hair dryer and flat iron/curling iron. I will never go back!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my 65 yr old mom who finds it hard to use a brush and a hairdryer at the same time. I actually meant to get her one that spins (this one does NOT), but I think it was a happy accident. This tool is very light and easy to use. The buttons are not confusing and she’s had no problem using it to style her chin length hair (after a quick lesson from me on proper blow out technique). I would point out that this tool would not be good for very short hair because the barrel is on the large size. The reason I didn’t give it 5 stars because it doesn’t get &#x27;hot&#x27;. It gets warm enought to style well, but you have to blow or air dry your hair to a certain extent before you can use this tool.</li>
    <li> This product was a bit of a disappointment, it wasn&#x27;t at all what I was expecting from it. What I liked about it was that it had a built-in brush meaning the brush does not come off which is a good thing, because I had other hot air brushes that the brush itself would come right off every time I did my hair. So when that happened I had to stop doing my hair, turn the brush off then wait a few minutes later to put the brush back on because the hair brush was hot. When I found the John Frieda brush I noticed the brush was built in which was great because I needed more durability but, what was a huge disappointment was that no matter how long I kept the hot air brush on, it was not very hot. I have shoulder length hair that&#x27;s very thick and curly, I also have nappy hairs here and there. Every time I did my hair with this product, my hair came out very frizzy. My hair takes an hour in a half to do. But with this product, even if I spent an extra hour on it, the result is always the same, I get frizzy hair. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you have thick, curly, nappy, African hair. This hot air brush would be more suitable for a person who has fine, thin, flat, or straight hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, dries my very think, curly hair straight &amp; smooth with very little need to use a hair straightener - even in a fairly humid area.</li>
    <li> This is my first review on Amazon. Something has to blow me away before I take the time to say something. An no pun intended, but this product did blow me away. Let me preface by saying, I get weekly blowouts that take an hour. I have very thick and course hair that has a natural wave to it. I have no skills whatsoever with a hair dryer so it has always been easier to pay someone to do it for me. This item allows my hair to look ALMOST as good as blowout with minimal effort and time. I was shocked after I got done and my hair had the smooth bouncy feeling. I have never been able to mimic that with any other gadget. This item may just replace the weekly blowouts, just maybe. At the very least, it will replace the top knot days for sure.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely frizzy and thick. When using this, it gives the appearance that it&#x27;s smooth, but when you look closely, you can see how hairs are alternating in different directions. It is still poofy. This is not meant for thick hair, it is easier to use when styling thin hair. It&#x27;s just sitting in my drawer. I got it for nothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now.  While it may not make styling your hair quite as easy as the ad says, it is a good tool to have in my hair care arsenal.  If used to dry the roots it gives a good lift. But I still have to use a light flat iron to tame that little bit of frizzy after this.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have fine hair and it works beautifully</li>
    <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed this tool! I am TERRIBLE at doing my hair and this makes it easy to do. Hair length is about an inch off the shoulder and I have fine hair but a lot of it-- It works well with a bit of pre-drying. Big fan.</li>
    <li> Does not rotate as described. Returning to the manufacturer!!!</li>
    <li> Love this!  So quick and really curls your hair. Beautiful silver tool!!  Solid construction.</li>
    <li> Perfectly suited to my hairstyle!  I dry and style my hair in a few short minutes.</li>
    <li> 2nd one I bought. They keep blowing out within a year on me. Warranty helps and they take care of you but still sucks they blow out so quickly. But that aside it blows your hair out great and as frizzy as my hair gets it helps control the frizz with the barrel brush blow drying method. It is hard to replicate the blow drying method like the salons do at home but this definitely gets you close to the salon look.</li>
    <li> Inconvenience and not useful at all. It should be a 5 dollar product, not worth what I paid for.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars. It doesn&#x27;t rotate n it&#x27;s not that good for drying hair. But on dry hair w/in seconds it curls my hair, n my hair looks beautiful. In the future I&#x27;ll probably get a better one. But for $27 this works great!</li>
    <li> Takes FOREVER to dry my hair with this.  Better off with a round brush and my blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I only wish the brush came off for cleaning!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t have the time or patience for a perfect blowout using a blow dryer and round brush, and this makes it incredibly easy and quick. I love that it doesn&#x27;t spin - I had a similar (but cheap) hot air brush growing up that spun, and I always ended up with horrible tangles.&lt;br /&gt;As with most hair styling tools, it takes some trial and error to master your technique (especially if it&#x27;s totally new to you), so give it a few tries before deciding whether it&#x27;s for you or not. This gives you the control over how much curl you want to add to your hair, in a very simple and quick way. If you just run it through your hair, you will end up with a bouncy but straight style with just a little bend at the ends (gorgeous). If you want more curl, hold it vertically and keep turning it through your hair as you go through the length of it (NEVER wrap the hair around it, just brush it through). You can also get a &amp;#34;Farrah&amp;#34; &#x27;do by curling away from your face and concentrating on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair, so I always do a &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; dry first, drying my hair about 75-80% before starting with the hot air brush. It makes the process go a lot faster, and you really only need the hot hair brush to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;This has 3 settings, low, high, and cool. I use high on most of my hair, low on the front (I don&#x27;t want to damage the thinner &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hair), and I rarely use the cool setting. It works just as well and is faster to give my hair a shot of cold hair from the regular blowdryer once the style is finished to set it.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love this product for the time it saves you after the shower and for all the hair style possibilities.</li>
    <li> The very best hair appliance ever for medium length, keratin and color treated hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have shorter wavy hair and i use this to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  My hair looks smooth vs. traditional hairdryer frizz&lt;br /&gt;  My hair doesn&#x27;t tangle at all&lt;br /&gt;  My hair has great body with this&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  I would prefer i higher flow of air&lt;br /&gt;  I have totally burned my hand with the brush end because there is no place to hold it. (i occasionally do need to grip the other end as&lt;br /&gt;  my hand/arm tires after pulling it through to straighten&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would  have given 4.5 stars but not an option. I would definitely recommend but warn about the potential for burning oneself.</li>
    <li> Great, tremendously speeds up the hair drying process.</li>
    <li> Bristles are hard and don&#x27;t do much for your hair. Returned.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this tool. All my days are good hair days now. As other reviewers have said, this is made for hair that is mostly dry so keep your regular dryer on hand if you&#x27;re ever in a real hurry. Using this styler hair now looks almost as good as if my hair dresser had styled it every day (not exaggerating). Amazing. I&#x27;ve been a hair klutz all my life -- where has this been? Super-duper easy-to-use and it doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair.</li>
    <li> I do not remember seeing anything in the product information that indicated the diameter of the roller. It was too large for my short hair and I had to use it to find this out.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hot air brush to replace the Revlon one I had that died. This one has exceeded my expectations. It is a much better quality than the Revlon one or the Conair one I had in the past. I partially blow dry my hair first with a blow dryer and then use this to finish drying while flipping the ends of my hair under. On the low setting, it works perfectly. I have never used a higher setting.</li>
    <li> I lOVE this hot air brush. I have extremely straight hair, cut in a shoulder length bob, and it usually takes several methods (either damp dry with soft rollers and flat iron, or use another type of hot brush and flat iron) to make it look as good as it can look.  I loathe spending so much time on my hair, meaning I&#x27;ve come to hate the whole procedure. I am a good swimmer, but I so hate the hassle of doing my shoulder length hair after a swim, that I&#x27;ve given up swimming entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I took a flyer on this John Frieda brush and without practice or trouble had my hair done in half the time and looking terrific.  I&#x27;m SOLD.  I worry a bit about how the brush part will last, as unlike some of them, it is soft on the hair (and therefore, like other brushes will eventually wear). Given how much I love it, I am going to buy at least one more.  I also bought the soft sectioning clips which did help when they did not pull out bits of my hair when removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, given that I need heat to style, I use the superb Fekkai Coiff pre-style thermal/uv protectant:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000XF12Y0 Frederic Fekkai Coiff Defense Pre-Style Thermal/UV Protectant]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS expensive, but nothing protects my hair better, has no other effect on it (not greasy or dry) and it seems to last a LONG time; one does not need much. It is even more important to protect hair from heat and sun if one colors it, as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, I rarely take the time to review things other than books, and I don&#x27;t work for any of these companies, but I&#x27;m considering swimming next weekend when we go for a family house party to celebrate multiple family events.  Doing my hair never was easier or less frustrating! THANK YOU!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, to Amazon, who carries almost everything I need; thank you, too!</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair from shoulder length to a bob just below my ears. I absolutely love the cut, but was having a hard time getting it to look good. After wearing my hair in a pony-tail for a million years, I just wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job of getting the back of my hair straight and curled under with a round brush and blow-dryer (my hair is very wavy when wet...if it&#x27;s not dried properly, it tends to look frizzy and matted. Hence the pony-tail for 12+ years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a flat iron, but never really felt comfortable with it. I initially searched for the InStyler rotating brush, but never found it here on Amazon. This brush came up as a recommendation though, and after watching a YouTube video on how it works, decided to go for it. I am so, so happy with this purchase. I absolutely LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, I have so much more control over how my hair gets dried since both hands aren&#x27;t being utilized by a separate brush and dryer, and I find that I&#x27;m spending less time drying and styling my hair since I can now work faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this enough. I can&#x27;t comment on all hair types, but if you have shorter fine hair, this is amazing. I&#x27;m actually going to buy a second one just to have as a back-up. I&#x27;m not worried about it crapping out on me anytime soon, but I&#x27;d hate for it to die one day, and I find that it&#x27;s no longer available. This has quickly become my most important styling tool.</li>
    <li> I have thin and fine hair and find this product dries hair really slowly, though I have already blow dried my hair half way.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the light weighted design, but this doesn&#x27;t work for me. 500WATTS just way less powerful.</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair. This is the best product I have ever used. It combines dryer &amp; flat iron which cuts the time in half to style your hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this thing! I have short to medium-length hair, and I&#x27;m useless at the old dryer / round brush routine that they do at the salon after a cut, but this makes my hair look just as good, and it&#x27;s so easy. Perfect size for getting soft, natural, curled-under ends and a little lift at the roots.</li>
    <li> Was hoping it was self spinning, other than that does give volume to my hair</li>
    <li> This hot air brush works really well without damaging my hair.  I have very thin hair and using this tool to style after partial blowdrying upside down works for volume!</li>
    <li> This is one of those hair curlers that you have to wrap your hair around the stem rather than having a clip to hold your hair. I don&#x27;t have enough hands to do what&#x27;s needed, so I returned this because I simply couldn&#x27;t wrap my hair around the stem. Instead, I got one of the curlers with the clip. It works great.</li>
    <li> I had higher expectations as I like John Frieda products.  Seems like it should be hotter.  Was hoping it would dry and smooth my hair so I could skip flat iron or curling iron, but my hair still comes out frizzy and it takes longer than using my conventional blow dryer and big round brush.  So it&#x27;s just sitting in the cabinet  :(</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have never been able to dry my hair like my stylist does - with both hands!!!  Now, with this dryer, I can separate my hair into sections, dry, and the finished product is a smoother, more frizz free hair style.  I have been looking for a dryer like this for a while and am very happy I finally found one.</li>
    <li> This is the best hot air brush I&#x27;ve owned.  The large barrel is great.  I highly recommend it for any length of hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews, and I am so happy I did! I should mention that this brush does not have the automatic roll up, you roll it manually instead. That was actually a nice surprise...one less thing to worry about while drying your hair. I have thick silver hair, and have it cut into a short bob cut...this thing created the most volume I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I use &#x27;Big Sexy Hair Root Booster&#x27; which I spray in sections on the roots, and after drying with this brush, I don&#x27;t even have to flat iron the ends if I don&#x27;t feel like it. My hair is so full, bouncy and the shine is amazing. It&#x27;s well worth the price, I may buy another one to have on hand in case they stop making this. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Great size but not enough power. It takes way to long and I wish I would have returned it before using. I can do much better with a round brush and blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best investment that I have made for my hair.  It is fast and my hair is soft, shiny and manageable.  I would highly recommend the air brush.</li>
    <li> Pretty much as described.  The only reservation I have is that it tends to get a little too hot on the high heat function.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably recommend using this on medium heat to protect hair from heat damage.</li>
    <li> I shampoo my hair only twice a week and use the traditional blow dryer and round brush for drying.  However, I could not do without my round hot air brush for in-between touch-ups.  I&#x27;ve used one for years and it brings my hair back to looking freshly done.  The reason for the not-perfect rating for this brush is because I have fine hair and the John Frieda brush makes it too smooth and flat.  For the person wanting flat, straight hair, I think it would be perfect.  For me, I&#x27;ll have to stick to my non-tourmaline hot air brush.  My daughter-in-law got my John Frieda dryer brush and loves it.  Bought for right price and no shipping.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  I wish it had been available years ago.  I have soft, natural curly hair, and this brush leaves my hair bouncy, shiny and styled for several days.  I suggest you blow dry the excess water from your roots on down before using this brush to style your hair.  This step speeds up your blow out time.</li>
    <li> I am a 42 year old female who has fine brown hair, which I color blond and is cut in a bob to around shoulder length. My family has a history of arthritis, which is effecting me in my hands for the past 5 years but has recently gotten progressively worse.  Thus, I am looking for things which I can do to put less stress on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hairstyle and hair type, I shampoo and blow dry my hair every day.  In order to get the style as needed, I use a round brush with a hairdryer.  But, it&#x27;s painful for me to hold and turn the brush to dry my hair.  And, as a result, I end up not drying it all of the way which makes it frizzy and makes me cold in the winter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking around on Amazon for products which might be able to help ease the effort my hands while still allowing for me to maintain the hairstyle that I like.  I saw this product and read the reviews and thought that I would give it a try.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is VERY LIGHTWEIGHT which is great for hands.  It is the size of a large round brush and in the middle of the brush, there are small holes which is where the air blows out from just like a hairdryer.  It has different speeds - Low Heat, High Heat and Cool (for setting the style).  It is important to note that the heat on the High Heat setting is not as hot as a regular hair dry and this is intention - you are holding this brush right next to your scalp to try the hair and so it can&#x27;t be as hot as a regular hair dryer.  I have no issues with this as my hair is fine and it dries it just fine.  I have chosen to use my regular hair dryer with my fingers to take most of the wetness out of the my hair first, and then I use this to finish drying it and styling it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it sounds like more work, it actually takes me less time because I do not have to the flat iron after my hair is dry as this brush dryer allows for me to smooth the hair while drying it which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am not sure how well that it would work for someone with very thick hair - you may want to do what I did and dry it first by air or with a hair dryer and then finish up the style with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, for me, I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it.w well that it would work for someone with very thick hair - you may want to do what I did and dry it first by air or with a hair dryer and then finish up the style with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, for me, I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am not a daily hair dryer user; generally I air dry and may use a brush and hair dryer to style a bit once my hair is mostly dry. This is the perfect combination for my method. The air volume is no where near that of a dryer, but adequate to dry, smooth and style damp hair. The &#x27;ceramic magic&#x27; part does seem to smooth my wiry, straight salt and pepper hair which adds shine and is an added plus. Amazon&#x27;s price was the best.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly enjoying the hot air brush.  It works well with my type of hair.  It makes it easier because It is all in one.  No need for a blow dryer plus a brush.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hot air brush to replace one I had that stopped working. I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. It dries hair quickly and smooths it. The big brush is perfect for medium long hair and thick hair like mine. Also, it doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair up in the bristles like my old one did.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike is the control button because sometimes it doesn&#x27;t move to the temperature you wanted as it&#x27;s a slider button.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a perfect product which I&#x27;d give 4.5 stars to but I couldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I suppose this is good for some, but I gave mine to a girlfriend after trying it a few times.  It&#x27;s much easier for me to use the blow dryer and a round brush.  This was so bulky at the handle I had a hard time with it and there is not much heat or air.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this hot air brush or not because it was so much different than the Jilbere one that I loved. Originally I wanted to replace it with the same one that I had, but Jilbere no longer is selling that one.  I was pleasantly surprised with the John Freda Hot Air Brush!  I read the reviews and decided to try this one based on the positive feedback.  I am so happy that I did.  I have very thick hair and this hot air brush works great for me!  I highly recommend this hot air brush!</li>
    <li> I have naturally very curly thick hair and have been using a round blow dryer to straighten it for years. This product does the job but only if you allow your hair to air dry for an extended period of time before using it. It lacks the heat and air power to dry hair that&#x27;s really wet. The bristles are the best part of the product. They really grip the hair and pull it make it easier to straighten.</li>
    <li> If your hands are medium- or small-size you may find this product hard to use due to its thick handle.  I did, so sent it back.</li>
    <li> I never had the patience to blow dry my long, thick, wavy hair until now. I use my regular blow dryer first, to get out excess water, then use the hot air brush. The whole process takes less than 30 min. I promised myself this year, that I was going to start styling my hair regularly and now I can do it!</li>
    <li> I do love this brush, my hair is not in mess any more.</li>
    <li> Takes a few minutes to dry your hair; it is better to start out with a regular blow dryer and finish off with the hot air brush (  and my hair is fine).</li>
    <li> works great, really like it. styling is very easy.  heating with the styling brush works great.  would recommend this to every one.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this isn&#x27;t my first hot air brush--this one doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do a good job.  My hair ends up looking frizzy every time.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> This product is good only for thin normal hair it doesn&#x27;t heat up enough for wavy thick hair like mine. Also I returned it and never got refunded and I ve been waiting over a month!!</li>
    <li> It is okay but the barrel is too large.  It would be okay for long and straight hair.  I prefer a smaller barrel.</li>
    <li> I used one time and after burn :-(((  very bad quality</li>
    <li> so much easier to use than holding a hair dryer in one hand and a styling brush in the other!  Have tried a couple of other John Frieda products recently and they all have more than met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Hot Tools styling brush dryer. I like this one better. It is light weight and does not tangle my hair. The brush holds the hair  but does not pull it or damage it. It dries well without burning. My hair is frizzy so no matter what blow dryer or brush I use, I still have to use a curling iron. This brush cuts my styling time and does a great job prepping my hair for the curling iron.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it claims.  My hair  is soft,  smooth,  straight, and shiny!  By far the best I&#x27;ve used, does not tangle in my hair and hat temp is perfect to hold my hair style and volume.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the good reviews but it was a complete waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;I have natural thick, long, wavy hair (picture J-Lo&#x27;s hair) and it took an eternity to be able to dry it because the power is so low.&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin, short hair maybe it&#x27;ll work for you, otherwise don&#x27;t bother buying.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the bristles are too soft and get stuck on my hair making it hard to release... and when it finally comes out it gives my hair an awful lot of static making it look horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the same Revlon brush I&#x27;ve used for a long time.  Even though the attachment keeps coming off all the time, I didn&#x27;t mind purchasing again because it dries my hair fast and leaves it silky and very shiny.</li>
    <li> This actually made my very fine hair flat and static, but I won&#x27;t waste my time returning it.  If you have baby fine hair this may not be for you, it definetly does not work on my hair.  I really hoped it would though because I blow dry and flat iron my hair everyday, so I bought this as an alternative but it does not help me.  Darn it.  If someone has a suggestion I&#x27;m all ears.</li>
    <li> I have thick combination curly to straight hair just passed my shoulders. After years of going to Dominicans to blow out my hair. I must say John has rescue me from wasted time a toll and a meal after the blow out to considered this product up there with the creation of the iPad. I can&#x27;t explain the the joy and happiness. As a real estate broker/ owner this product has liberate me and will be the only hair dryer needed when I can get away. It well worth the investment. Ladies, leave hair In Towel for 10 mins. Section the front, mid and back. Dry front, then mid and back section. Dry the section of the roots front and back first, the mid section of the hair and last roll the ends then bump. My hair was bouncy and professional looking after 40 mins. My husband could not believed the transformation with the product as I did. Thank you John.</li>
    <li> The hot air brush is okay  but the handle could be thinner and then it might be easier to maneuver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; and I thought I would love it. It&#x27;s a great idea, it just doesn&#x27;t hold the hair well enough to blow it out.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life? I&#x27;ve used it 4 times and now that I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it, my hair looks like I just walked out of the salon. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> First off, it arrived full of someone else&#x27;s hair.  I understand that some other person might have tried it and returned it, but you don&#x27;t send it off as new and unchecked.  It did make my hair shiny. but I got no volume. It also took much longer to do my hair while using it.  I have tried it on several occasions, after cleaning out the mystery hair and Lysoling it, but was disapointed each time.  I will be returning it.  I will also be removing my hair from the brush.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product, I always had issues trying to blow dry and trying to use a brush, getting the right angle, and often I had to rely more on my curling iron or flat iron to actually style my hair. I love using the Hot Air Brush because I only have to hold one thing so my arms don&#x27;t get tired, and I can style my hair while blow drying. I have shoulder length fine hair, and when my siblings tried it with their thicker, longer hair, it took quite a bit longer and was not really what they wanted. I recommend for flipping your hair out, or the nice round bob.</li>
    <li> The product was advertised on &amp;#34;The View&amp;#34; as a hair dryer that would style your hair just like your hairdresser does.&lt;br /&gt;Well it doesn&#x27;t, it did dry my hair but I already had a hot air brush  that I paid $15.00 for.  My $15.00 hot air brush does just as good as the John Frieda one does and doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much.</li>
    <li> This brush is lightweight, comfortable to the scalp, and easy to use. It adds nice volume and shape to my fine hair.</li>
    <li> There is no temperature setting and it gets so hot I can&#x27;t touch the end of the brush. With it that hot it can&#x27;t be good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had a Helen of Troy air brush before and I wish I had just gotten that one again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t wind up doing the job I wanted it to do. I wanted to be able to use it to straighten my hair some, but all it did was cause frizz.</li>
    <li> It gave my hair lots of volume!!!! I would highly recommend this product. Well worth the price. I say Go for It!</li>
    <li> I read most of the reviews before purchasing this item.  I wish the head would rotate vs being stationary.  Over all, does an ok job.</li>
    <li> I, usually blow dry a little with a regular dryer first, then follow up with this to add some volume. Because this blower brush is not very powerful and would take forever for me to dry all of my long hair. All in all it gets the job done for me.</li>
    <li> everything i needed and wanted. light weight and effective. everything i needed  and more than i expected.have no more words!</li>
    <li> does this spin or rotate?please suggest if this would be good for short hair and if it has spinning action</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for my wife as a birthday gift. Item arrived on time as ordered and was not damaged in shipment. My wife really likes the way it dries her hair and it seems to dry her hair quicker than using a standard hair dryer without overheating her hair.</li>
    <li> I have rather thick hair so I do some initial drying with the regular hair dryer then finish with this hot air brush. Much easier and quicker than using a brush and a dryer. Nice smooth finish.</li>
    <li> See my review on the other top hot air brush contender here, [[ASIN:B004INUWX0 Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, Black]]: http://www.amazon.com/review/ROMGY956S8H6L/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B004INUWX0&amp;linkCode&#x3D;&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no beginner when it comes to hair tools but I&#x27;ve never been able to master the art of a blow dryer and a round brush. Randomly I ran across this product as well as the Conair Infinitipro styler. Initially I thought this rotated like the Conair version but it does not. Turns out what I thought I wanted doesn&#x27;t work like I expected and the John Frieda version is much, much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to read the whole review the bottom line is this: For a true salon quality looking blow out, go with the John Frieda device and NOT the Conair rotating hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---- After several comments, I&#x27;d like to add that your mileage will probably vary according to your hair type. I have long (mid-back), semi-thick wavy hair. This may have something to do with why the different stylers had such different results. The Conair just couldn&#x27;t get through my hair----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a (literal) side by side comparison of the  [[ASIN:B004INUWX0 Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, Black]] and the [[ASIN:B0056GDG90 John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush, 1.5 inch]]. Let&#x27;s just say after 30 minutes or so on one side with the Infinitipro brush, I gave up. That was even on the side that I typically find easier to style. The side that&#x27;s more difficult I tackled with the John Frieda brush and then went back to fix what the Infinitipro just couldn&#x27;t do. I did all that in the time it took me to get less than mediocre results with the one side of the Infinitipro brush. Anywho, the overall summary of the John Frieda device:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The hair dryer actually does a decent job of drying while it styles&lt;br /&gt;- The bristles are sturdy and add shine but also allows for more precision in defining layers and getting the curl right where you want it&lt;br /&gt;- No tangles!&lt;br /&gt;- Controls frizz and makes it easy to avoid the weird waves and curls that occur near the roots with traditional hair drying. Even easy to get the back of your head!&lt;br /&gt;- Can easily maneuver different sections of hair without having to put the brush down. Although this sounds really basic and a bit silly, I didn&#x27;t appreciate it until I tried the Conair rotating brush where I had to put it down then very carefully section out hair so random hairs wouldn&#x27;t get caught in the spinning frenzy.&lt;br /&gt;- I have long, naturally wavy hair that is fine but there&#x27;s lots of it. Unlike most tools, brushes, etc. the JF brush had no problem managing the layers and truly making it look like the beautiful end curling that you get in a true blow out. I went back and fixed the frizzy mess the Conair did to my hair with the JF brush.&lt;br /&gt;- Light and easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The tip on the top gets very hot. Although I don&#x27;t need it often, it would be nice if this was some sort of heat resistant or silicon coated topper so when I need to hold it for certain angles, I can.&lt;br /&gt;- I wish the actual brush area was a little bit longer- just a smidge. It does the job though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the John Frieda brush is better than the Conair Infinitipro rotating brush:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to handle, easy to maneuver, and fits in your hand. The Infinitipro is clunky, large, and more often than not, I found myself hitting the wrong darn button and creating a crazy unexpected rat&#x27;s nest&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s pretty darn fast whereas the Conair took FOREVER and didn&#x27;t even do a good job. Like I said above, I used the JF to fix the frizz &amp; limp looking curls caused by the Conair&lt;br /&gt;- Brush bristles are stiffer but still do not tangle. The more rigid bristles allow for better defined curls &amp; layers as well as more control over the angles and getting the smooth, straight look of a blow out&lt;br /&gt;- Although the hair dryer probably won&#x27;t replace the power of your typical hair dryer, the John Frieda is leaps and bounds better than the Conair. Parts of my hair, especially near the roots, was still slightly damp after using the Infinitipro for nearly 30 minutes on only one side. The JF brush took care of that in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, don&#x27;t waste your time wondering about the Infinitipro, just go with the John Frieda brush.

    <li> I ordered this hairbrush due to reviews and 1 1/2 inch size. It did a perfect salon finish to my thick slightly wavy hair in a third the time of using a hair dryer and curing iron or flat iron. Since it is summer I let my hair dry about half way then used this brush. It did not make my hair to hot and did not tangle. I did not try to curl hair. I just wanted a smooth straight finish with a little bend in the ends. It was a miracle. It is also nice to work with such a light piece of equipment. I am so glad I found this and love it.</li>
    <li> Finally - one product that can straighten and dry at the same time!  I dry my hair until almost dry and then I use this to  finish the straightening and light curl on the end.  I have weak arms and this really saves them!  I should probably buy another one just incase they stop making them.</li>
