<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The best oil around for moisturizing.  I use on hands, feet and even my face all year round.  It&#x27;s not greasy, oily and just makes your skin feel lux.  Love it!  It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this oil is amazing. I know I&#x27;m not getting a blend of oils, I&#x27;m getting pure jojoba.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Arrived perfect condition. This oil is wonderful and fantastic quality. I like this brand the best of those I have tried. It doesn&#x27;t break me out and is great for skin.</li>
    <li> This oil is so light and absorbent.  I frequently add  2 or 3 drops of oil to my palms, rub them in, and then run my hands through my daughters and my wet hair prior to braiding for a little extra conditioning.  All (3) of us have thigh length or greater hair and this oil does the trick. If any of our hair appears to be getting dry at the ends, I will add an extra drop and focus on that area in particular. It always absorbs 100% (no oily after effects) and gives our hair that little bit of extra protection.  I did quite a bit of research before deciding to try Jojoba oil and I want to thank everyone who reviewed this particular brand for making my choice much easier.  It appears that several other brands are not nearly as good (or pure?) as Desert Essence so I found all of the previous reviews quite helpful when making my choice of which one to try.  This may be a tad bit more expensive than some other brands online, but this product is well worth it!</li>
    <li> My husband and I suffer from psoriasis, and we use the jojoba oil on our face and scalp daily. A little goes a long way.  I pour a half of a bottle of oil into a little 4oz. squeze bottle with a sppout, something like a bottle for hair color.&lt;br /&gt;It is not sticky and greasy, yuck.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t write reviews but i had to share my experience with this product.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional in quality and worked very well in my lotion recipes.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for mixing with essential oils or using by itself.</li>
    <li> Lubrication for quiet moments. Helps with sensational needs. Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great for moisturizing, massage and other uses! No odor and the best skin lubricant without being oily, sticky, tacky or drying out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later: still love this stuff and so does my wife. We use it all the time and have had to re-order it several times.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love using jojoba oil as a make up remover and a face moisturizer. It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions or breakouts. I&#x27;ve been buying this specific brand for a while now and absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> great product and fast shipping time</li>
    <li> It was delivered as describe. Yes you do get a two pack of the jojoba oil and I was glad that it followed through. I&#x27;m usually iffy about those kind of deals when it says  two packs in the header. Luckily I got what I ordered and couldn&#x27;t have been any happier.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product to help with dry flaky skin for facial hair during the dry winter months after trying many other shampoos. After the first time using the oil I noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> Love, love this stuff. Leaves my hair a skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> Very good.. worth your money</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR SO MANY USES</li>
    <li> I started using this for an affordable carrier oil option almost a year ago and I lOVE IT! I use it for many recipes instead of FCO....I will buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this oil.  Clean, smooth, always a consistent product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, keeps my pale face from peeling in the dry winter.</li>
    <li> Great price for the two of these, and I actually like that it is in smaller bottles for storage in the cabinet. Will be using this in homemade skincare products.</li>

    <li> Great stuff-it plays well with other oils, like essential patchouli or jasmine-makes the real expensive ones last alot longer and is good on the leather feet!</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  I received my products very fast.  Will definitely order from this company again.  Thank  you.</li>
    <li> I use this product on hair, as a facial cleanser, on entire body after shower and my child&#x27;s hair. It has a very mild smell that goes away after it soaks in and does not hurt my eyes if i need to use it for an eye makeup remover.</li>
