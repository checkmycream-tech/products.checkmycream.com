      <li>Decided to check Amazon first and good</li>
      <li>the product and results were pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I was given a sample of this while on vacation in Hawaii, I love the way it softens my skin and reduces the appearance of fine lines</li>
      <li>I know some reviewers don&#x27;t think this is any better than the \\&quot;dime store\\&quot; brand, however, I have NOT found that to be true.</li>
      <li>They are hands down the best products I have ever used.</li>
      <li>which is great for those of us who live in the hot south.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love the entire Gratiae product line.  </li>
      <li>A full bottle and met all of my expectations.  </li>
      <li>This is really good for daytime during spring and summer weather because it&#x27;s a bit lighter than the regular serum.</li>
      <li>I really feel like there is a decrease in my fine lines.</li>
      <li>As for the Gratiae website and the prices there -- it makes me laugh.  </li>

      <li>The price is much cheaper than shopping at the high priced kieosks at the mall</li>
      <li>At the high prices they were asking, ($150-$300 per product), I choose not to make an impulse buy but to research it myself.  </li>
      <li>Leading department store brands that have been around for years, one in particular has come out with a new wrinkle lifter that works much better than this and at less than 40% of the cost.</li>
      <li>Let me say first, that not every product is going to work the same for everyone.</li>
      <li>I had pretty deep wrinkles around my jaw line.</li>

      <li>The package doesn&#x27;t look like packed professionally.</li>

<li> Not sure about this.</li>
<li> The Gratiae product line is no better or worse than any other skin care line.  </li>
<li> At least not for me, my sister or</li>
<li> My skin is literally unbelievable!!</li>
<li> Also, all the products come to me with the seal broken.</li>
<li> am a little disappointed with people rating their experience with the product marketing in Vegas, rather than the product and their experience in here.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it was the wrong product...</li>
<li> This is not wonderful.  </li>
<li> the packaging really disappointed.</li>
<li> Gratiae products are an expensive rip off!!</li>
<li> Plus it has a nasty smell, reminds me of Nair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think that it is great because it keeps my Rosacea in check</li>
    <li> When I was in Vegas a month ago, I was pulled into a retail shop selling skin care products and this line was demonstrated to me.  At the high prices they were asking, ($150-$300 per product), I choose not to make an impulse buy but to research it myself.  I found it significantly cheaper on Amazon and therefore bought several of their products.  After using it for over a month now, I am not impressed with the results and am so glad that I didn&#x27;t full price.  Plus it has a nasty smell, reminds me of Nair.</li>
    <li> Let me say first, that not every product is going to work the same for everyone. I am a white, 54 year old female. I have oily skin on my forehead and normal to dry everywhere else. I have tried many, many products. This product has been great for my face. I had pretty deep wrinkles around my jaw line. I use this and the Ultrox Expression serum at night. I use the Gratiae Replenishing Serum and Cream in the morning. The deep wrinkles have dimished by about 50% to 75%. I know some reviewers don&#x27;t think this is any better than the \\&quot;dime store\\&quot; brand, however, I have NOT found that to be true. What I really like is it is absorbed quickly and makes my face soft. I couldn&#x27;t make myself pay the amount found on the Gratiae website, so buying it here at Amazon has been great for my budget. It doesn&#x27;t take much so the bottle last and last. I have only been using it for about 5 weeks but in that time my face continues to look fresher and less \\&quot;old.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I was not overjoyed with the serum , I did not see or feel any difference. I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> Oh so much cheaper than those kiosks in the malls sell the very same product for. They will RIP YOU OFF!!!</li>
    <li> Where is the item manufactured? The package doesn&#x27;t look like packed professionally. I bought 5 items in one order, they came on time but only one item has the plastic wrapper over the box, the other 4 items looked like open boxes, and there were no product manual in any of the boxes, strange! This makes me wonder if it&#x27;s safe to use the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for about 18 months.  I like how my skin feels and it does help with the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Goes a long way. Works well to reduce lines and wrinkles. Has a very pleasant aroma. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Still trying to test to see what difference the product makes.  It does not come with instructions and I think that might be helpful.</li>
    <li> For the way it works this is just a great deal. I believe I bought another after using it. It has a bit of a perfume smell although it lightens up and improves my skin. Nice price!</li>
    <li> Gratiae products are an expensive rip off!!</li>
    <li> The stores where you buy Gratiae products will tell you it isn&#x27;t the same product .... Feels exactly the same to me, at less than a quarter of the cost!</li>
    <li> Gratiae products are all Certified Organic. They last a long time and they do not seen to harden or evaporate like some products I have tried.</li>
    <li> At 62, I am dealing with the skin aging as we all do.  This has give my skin new life and am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Product was demonstrated at a mall and when she put it on my forehead (one side only) I visibly saw the wrinkles disappear and now, a couple of months later, the wrinkles are still gone. However, this products does NOT do that. I have purchased several gratia products and have used this one for several months with very little improvement in wrinkles. Also, all the products come to me with the seal broken. One had leaked most of the product into the packaging. They replaced it but that one too was not sealed. Makes me wonder if this is a different product than the one demonstrated at the mall.</li>
    <li> I 1st bought this product at a little kiosk in FL, where it was much more expensive than Amazon.com. I have been using it ever since, and would definitely recommend it,</li>
    <li> I am 50 and I look 35. I have used everything under the sun on my skin. I discovered this line a year ago and I will never go back. They are hands down the best products I have ever used. My skin is literally unbelievable!!</li>
    <li> I use this every day/night...softens fine lines and makes the skin so soft and not tested on animals..would buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this at my sister&#x27;s recommendation after she had a salesperson show her this in Vegas.  Unfortunately, it was the wrong product...the product she loved in Vegas was Oro (see that product for reviews), which visibly gives you a life instantly.  The Gratiae product line is no better or worse than any other skin care line.  It does not diminish wrinkles.  At least not for me, my sister or my boss.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, but so are the Olay products.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy these again.  As for the Gratiae website and the prices there -- it makes me laugh.  I&#x27;m amazed at what people will buy to look younger -- me included.&lt;br /&gt;This just does not do what it claims.  Again, other reviewers may not have much experience in other skin regimes -- I&#x27;m an addict.  I&#x27;ll try anything that someone tells me is wonderful.  This is not wonderful.  It&#x27;s ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have recently ordered the product (Oro Instant Firming Serum) that made my sister squeal in Vegas,  I will review it - honestly - after I give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;Until then -- save your money!</li>
    <li> perfect,  i will order again soon..</li>
    <li> Not sure about this. It&#x27;s textue is like water down. Used whole bottle..Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really helps repair damage to the skin.  Was delighted to find this product at a much better price on Amazaon.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this while on vacation in Hawaii, I love the way it softens my skin and reduces the appearance of fine lines</li>
    <li> Love all of there products!  Will purchase it again!  I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year and do see a difference.</li>
    <li> Love this product with the anti wrinkle cream.  I really feel like there is a decrease in my fine lines.</li>
    <li> This is really good for daytime during spring and summer weather because it&#x27;s a bit lighter than the regular serum. I mix it with some of the Ultrox Expression Marks Anti Wrinkle Cream and let it absorb before applying makeup. I think it&#x27;s effective as an anti-agin product.</li>
    <li> I love this serum but I have found products at 40% the cost that work as well or better. Leading department store brands that have been around for years, one in particular has come out with a new wrinkle lifter that works much better than this and at less than 40% of the cost. I do like this product but I just don&#x27;t think it is worth the hundreds of dollars charged for it.</li>
    <li> the packaging really disappointed. like old stock needs to be cleared out quickly.. that&#x27;s why the price at such high discount..</li>
    <li> I was at the Mall and this person stopped me and asked if i would like to have a free facial. I said sure. He had a stand and started to use this product on my face. I did like the way that it went on &amp; the smell. He told me that I could purchase 2 items for $150.00. I wrote a check and after I left it started to bother me. Went home and looked up amazon.com. The price I liked. Went back to the mall and told him I decided not to purchase. So he gave me back my check. Thank God</li>
    <li> Most of the other Premier products are thicker and go on nice, this was super thin and I just didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing anything.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Same exact stuff as what I paid three times more in Vegas.  it works wonders on my skin.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the entire Gratiae product line.  Has a wonderful clean scent.  Doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy which is great for those of us who live in the hot south.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for about 3 years and have worked on me great</li>
    <li> This product is great!  just like the other reveiewers, I was appraoched in Vegas at a hotel and demo&#x27;d the product and results were pretty good.  Decided to check Amazon first and good I did!  Received the product and it is exactly as what I saw in vegas, because i took pictures of the product and box.  This is also made in israel and the packaging and product appear to be the same and the results are also great!  Saved a lot of money!&lt;br /&gt;I am a little disappointed with people rating their experience with the product marketing in Vegas, rather than the product and their experience in here.</li>
    <li> A full bottle and met all of my expectations.  My husband is hooked on it now too! The price is much cheaper than shopping at the high priced kieosks at the mall</li>
