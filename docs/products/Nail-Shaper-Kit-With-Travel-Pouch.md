<ol>
      <li>Product arrived in excellent shape.  </li>
      <li>this product is a very amazing product!!!!</li>
      <li>no its not the best quality item out there</li>
      <li>This nail shaper is one of the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful kit for home nail care.</li>
      <li>The plastic feels chintzy and the tips aren&#x27;t very good quality.</li>
      <li>and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>But, remember, \\&quot;It is what it is\\&quot; and you too will be happy with your purchase if you remember that.</li>
      <li>Works great product as described</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with my product.</li>
      <li>this is a great kit...</li>
      <li>But it works great for taking off burrs on clay work.</li>
      <li>I use it and it works good.</li>
      <li>All in all a good nail file system</li>
      <li>Surprising Amazon hadn&#x27;t reviewed this themselves before allowing it to be sold on their web site.  </li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I had the brand name item and liked the way it worked.</li>
      <li>And since I&#x27;ve never used a mechanical file system, I figured a cheap one would do me good.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice product that is very easy to use and the cost is right.</li>
      <li>I had an original Salon Shaper that I loved.</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made, but as they say, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It gives me the perfect manicure by making my nail surface nice and smooth without the labor of a manual nail buffer. :O)</li>
      <li>The cheap plastic housing was a disaster!  </li>
      <li>love it......</li>
      <li>Glad I found it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s ok...</li>
      <li>Build quality could be better but thats just me.</li>
      <li>I love it for the price</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to spend 20 bucks on a nail dremel, get a better model and brand.</li>
      <li>I use mine more for my toenails than finger.  </li>
      <li>It could use more power.</li>
      <li>and I wanted more equipment to take care of them besides clippers and a file.</li>
      <li>I love this shaper kit.</li>
      <li>but it is nice and cheap.  </li>
      <li>The top part won&#x27;t stay connected to the bottom after putting the batteries inside.</li>
      <li>Maybe one star is too many.  </li>
      <li>i love how it&#x27;s easy to handle and maneuver..</li>
      <li>i highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in buying this product!!!!!</li>
      <li>I also discovered that most bits fit this as well</li>
      <li>I loved it so much that I wanted another one just like it.</li>
      <li>It does, however, file off excess cuticle and calluses quite easily, so just watch</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect too much from this nail kit, but it works better than I had imagined.  </li>
      <li>It still has the ability to do damage no matter how cheap it is.</li>
      <li>I did my nails earlier and they look great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, though, so you get what you get in terms of that.</li>
      <li>is shorter and squatter than the original</li>
      <li>1)It&#x27;s not as powerful as the original</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>(super pain....)</li>
      <li>It was a very nice product that came with other shaving tools.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using mine for five years now, so that&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s got very limited function.    </li>
      <li>I bought this because I wanted to start doing my nails more professionally.</li>
      <li>but there is a learning curve if you don&#x27;t have strong normal nails like everyone else.</li>
      <li>and if you hold it a certain way it comes right off!</li>
      <li>didnt do my nails right</li>
      <li>It as just the right amount of power to avoid getting hurt while still doing the job.</li>
      <li>This is the second shaper kit I have purchased and I have found it to be as effective as the first.</li>
      <li>n&#x27;t it&#x27;s strong enough to give a manicure from scratch, but it&#x27;s fine for upkeep.</li>
      <li>Battery operated, I thought it&#x27;d be great for travel as I also had a much more expensive electric set.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t fit as nicely into narrow spaces as the original.&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first it   just went on and off, but now it is not working at all.  </li>
      <li>and you may have to use clippers to get the rest, but other than that I love it!</li>
      <li>OK, I do not care if the machine is actually a piece of plastic imported from China.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for a higher quality item elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I had one of these for years since it first was an as seen on tv.  </li>
      <li>&quot; so there&#x27;s the first problem.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty obsessive about my nails</li>
      <li>The motor in this is pretty peppy for a 10$ item.</li>
      <li>The pink bag it came in was nice.</li>
      <li>it is useful, but it doesn&#x27;t have to much power.  </li>
      <li>is very inexpensive and works very well and does the job right.</li>
      <li>bought two of these because they looked to be the exact same thing as the original Salon Shaper.</li>
      <li>I got an idea (I still had the dead favorite in a drawer), I pulled it out and looked at the name on it and entered it into the Amazon search engine, suddenly I could own a new one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just an amazing little thing</li>
      <li>If I went to fast with the file it would break my nails.  </li>
      <li>how much you do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It shapes and smoothes your nails very well.</li>
      <li>I have one of these myself and really like it</li>
      <li>To my surprise it works really well for my needs.  </li>
      <li>Another is that it really doesn&#x27;t have much power.</li>
      <li>The bits don&#x27;t even file nails very well.</li>
      <li>Some would hurt your nail but it worked very well.</li>
      <li>Very dissappointed</li>
      <li>i am very disapointed, it does not work at all.</li>
      <li>It works very well.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t buff well, shape well, or really anything well.</li>
      <li>Just junked it and bought a new one since the price was very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Obviously, this one isn&#x27;t the best around, but it&#x27;s better to start off slowly and learn how to use equipment in small steps.</li>
      <li>And the filling things waisted really quick by the second set I did.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on normal nails.</li>
      <li>so I was able to add a few to the set.  </li>
      <li>I would like a new one.  </li>
      <li>I had to be very careful and light with the files on my nails.</li>
      <li>it is a cheap imitation of the nail drills at the salons...</li>
      <li>I just threw it out because was to busy to do the return and wasn&#x27;t worth it to ship back.</li>
      <li>Also, the on button is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>I suggest this to anyone who wants to start off slow and cheap, or just looking for something that doesn&#x27;t take as much work and effort as manual files and buffers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I expect to use it for a good few months before buying a more expensive nail kit.</li>
      <li>Only issue I have is the buffer spins off this powder dust the first use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t use this product. It did not include the nail sharpening pieces. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Falls apart every time.</li>
    <li> it is useful, but it doesn&#x27;t have to much power.  At the end it works, I would like if you won&#x27;t have to push the button all the time but it is nice and cheap.  I&#x27;m happy with my product.</li>
    <li> It says \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; so there&#x27;s the first problem. Another is that it really doesn&#x27;t have much power. Lastly, the buffing \\&quot;bits\\&quot; don&#x27;t have enough roughness or softness so combined with the lack of power that it has, giving yourself a simple manicure can take 4 times longer than it should but by then I don&#x27;t expect this product to last more than a few sessions for the price anyways.</li>
    <li> Ever since i decided to go without the fake nails this product has become essential to my beauty routine... no its not the best quality item out there but it def gets the job done! It gives me the perfect manicure by making my nail surface nice and smooth without the labor of a manual nail buffer. :O)</li>
    <li> OK, I do not care if the machine is actually a piece of plastic imported from China. So what, its only 12 dollars. The only thing that Im not happy about is the POWER. It could use more power. It doesnt necessarily remove cuticles, it just helps you get to them easier.</li>
    <li> This review is coming from someone with thin and brittle nails due to diet restraints-  I bought this because I hated manually filing my nails.  The motor in this is pretty peppy for a 10$ item. I had to be very careful and light with the files on my nails. If I went to fast with the file it would break my nails.  I hated the buffer piece- the fuzzy one. It BURNED my nails. I could only do short little touches, which was pointless.  This worked well for my toes though.  It ended up breaking for some reason or another. Just junked it and bought a new one since the price was very reasonable.  All in all a good nail file system but there is a learning curve if you don&#x27;t have strong normal nails like everyone else.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to start doing my nails more professionally. And since I&#x27;ve never used a mechanical file system, I figured a cheap one would do me good. Obviously, this one isn&#x27;t the best around, but it&#x27;s better to start off slowly and learn how to use equipment in small steps. Doesn&#x27;t seem like it, but this thing CAN injure you, no matter how low power it may seem. I made the mistake of filing the cuticle underneath my nail too much, and now it hurts a little, plus it makes my thumbnail weaker. It does, however, file off excess cuticle and calluses quite easily, so just watch how much you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So DO be careful. It still has the ability to do damage no matter how cheap it is. Overall, I like this buy. Glad I found it. I expect to use it for a good few months before buying a more expensive nail kit. I did my nails earlier and they look great. Only issue I have is the buffer spins off this powder dust the first use. Don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s about, but it doesn&#x27;t spin off dust anymore. I suggest this to anyone who wants to start off slow and cheap, or just looking for something that doesn&#x27;t take as much work and effort as manual files and buffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional comment: I bought this a while ago, I&#x27;d say almost two years or so ago... When it was like 10 bucks. It&#x27;s NOT worth the 20 dollars they bumped it up to. If you&#x27;re going to spend 20 bucks on a nail dremel, get a better model and brand. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s lasted me this long, does a good job, and I still use it, but the quality in the tool itself is just not there. I don&#x27;t know why they bumped it up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this off Amazon thinking it was the item pictured. The ones (I ordered 2) I received were not what was pictured. One of the bits looks different than the photo and there&#x27;s no brand marking on the side. I had the brand name item and liked the way it worked. The cheap imitation this seller sent was horrible. There is no means to keep the bits in place. The slightest pressure pushes them off center and causes the motor to seize. Push the bit in too far and it won&#x27;t move at all. Don&#x27;t push it in far enough and it flies off. Pretty scary - I&#x27;d hate to catch one of those pointy-tipped ones in the face! I am sending both back. Don&#x27;t waste your money. You&#x27;ll be sorely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve just went to a store and bought one. Turning on the nail shaper is badly made. When you have to hold it down it doesn&#x27;t work! The trim around that area reminds me as if battery acid leaked out. With the way the product is made it&#x27;s caked around battery area stopping it from staying on and if you hold it a certain way it comes right off! Horrible product that I regret buying. Very cheaply made, but as they say, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed by its performance, it could have been sharper (or stronger); Maybe it is good enough for its price.</li>
    <li> I had this product before and it broke. I loved it so much that I wanted another one just like it.</li>
    <li> actual product does not work that well on Labradors, but it does the job. Seller was prompt. (It arrived to me in Hawaii in 5 days.) Product arrived in excellent shape.  I would not hesitate to use this company again  Mahalo  Re</li>
    <li> Barely works to shape acrylic nails.  spend the extra $20 and buy a cordless Dremel[[ASIN:B002BACCDA Dremel 7700-1/15 MultiPro 7.2-Volt Cordless Rotary Tool Kit]].</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t spin quite straight after very little use. That means you can&#x27;t really predict how much it will shave off with a little touch. It burns the skin outside the nail. Out of 5 things that you can use, only 1 actually works at desired speed. The other ones either destroy your nails or don&#x27;t seem to do anything at all. I&#x27;ve been using mine for five years now, so that&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s got very limited function.    Also, the on button is very sensitive. I&#x27;ve woken up on buses with people telling me there was something making a noise in my bag...</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s quality is very poor! The connection between the main unit and the battery does not close properly and the unit constantly shuts off due to poor connection. Would NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item thinking it would be powerful enough to file down thickened tonails.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed.  The tips didn&#x27;t fit into the wand correctly and even with 2 new batteries, it barely turned fast enough to rough up the nail.  I would never purchase this again, and would&#x27;nt reccomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is really a waste of money! It has no power and is pretty useless. I&#x27;ll be looking for a higher quality item elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Its made of very poor quality plastic. The cap is not designed well. It is very difficult to put batteries and put the cap back. In the process the plastic grooves which are so thin, wear out and the whole thing is unusable. Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this shaper kit. I am not a real fanatic on nails, but I do pay some attention to them and this little machine does what it says it will do.  I use mine more for my toenails than finger.  I wear sandals a lot or go barefooted and am a bit vain about how my toenails look.  this shapes and smoothes them well and keeps them looking like I like.  This is a very nice product that is very easy to use and the cost is right.</li>
    <li> I had an original Salon Shaper that I loved. It was small, but it did the work well. I was surprised and pleased with it&#x27;s power for being such a small thing. Unfortunately, the case cracked in travel and I needed to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of these because they looked to be the exact same thing as the original Salon Shaper. But I&#x27;m a little disappointed for 2 reasons: 1)It&#x27;s not as powerful as the original so it doesn&#x27;t work as quickly and 2)One of the diamond bits to take off dead skin is shorter and squatter than the original so it doesn&#x27;t fit as nicely into narrow spaces as the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok... I&#x27;m just disappointed it wasn&#x27;t a 1 to 1 replacement even though it&#x27;s the same item.</li>
    <li> doesnt work put batteries in and it starts barely and when touch nail stops and wont work it is a piece of junk that i will have to throw away.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000WU38QQ Nail Shaper Kit]] This is the second shaper kit I have purchased and I have found it to be as effective as the first. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for years since it first was an as seen on tv.  It works very well.  Got another brand name machine of same type in store it did not do the job. It was supposed to take a month 2 get here got here in 2 weeks direct from China. Well done</li>
    <li> Not happy at all was thinking i would be the tool kept falling out the end n didnt do my nails right</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and when I got it, it looked used, the packaging was horrible. NOT GOOD</li>
    <li> Item was very poorly made and the nail tips came in a little baggie that made the item look used and unsanitary, not new. I was going to give it to a person for Christmas, but was too embarrassed. I just threw it out because was to busy to do the return and wasn&#x27;t worth it to ship back.</li>
    <li> this product is a very amazing product!!!! It shapes and smoothes your nails very well. ever since i got rid of my fake nails i have always been upsesed with nails.this product is very inexpensive and works very well and does the job right. i highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in buying this product!!!!!   </li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect too much from this nail kit, but it works better than I had imagined.  I get regular manicures, but I wanted something to keep up my nails until the next appointment, and this does the trick.  I don&#x27;t it&#x27;s strong enough to give a manicure from scratch, but it&#x27;s fine for upkeep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought lots of $10 products - some actually do what they are intended to do - this one does not.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy something else.  Surprising Amazon hadn&#x27;t reviewed this themselves before allowing it to be sold on their web site.  Maybe one star is too many.  The pink bag it came in was nice.</li>
    <li> It works okay, but the quality is poor. The plastic feels chintzy and the tips aren&#x27;t very good quality. It&#x27;s cheap, though, so you get what you get in terms of that.</li>
    <li> This nail shaper is one of the best I&#x27;ve owned. It as just the right amount of power to avoid getting hurt while still doing the job.</li>
    <li> This product was useless.  Not worth the trouble to send it back.  The cheap plastic housing was a disaster!  No more.</li>
    <li> I have a nail Shaper from the past and was extremely upset when it suddenly stopped working. I looked for it again and never found another one that looked or worked the same. I got an idea (I still had the dead favorite in a drawer), I pulled it out and looked at the name on it and entered it into the Amazon search engine, suddenly I could own a new one.  Although the new one is slightly larger and the plastic nubs inside are missing to make sure it is tight and the contacts are in the correct place for the battery to get connection it seems to work as I remember.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong it is a cheap imitation of the nail drills at the salons...hello??...it takes 2 AA batteries!  For the price and the capability of 2 AA batteries it works as I expected and I am happy with my purchase. But, remember, \\&quot;It is what it is\\&quot; and you too will be happy with your purchase if you remember that.</li>
    <li> It broke by the next day! And the filling things waisted really quick by the second set I did. Can I replace it with something else?</li>
    <li> I am \\&quot;SOOOOOOO\\&quot; dissapointed :( with \\&quot;Nail shaper Kit\\&quot;!!! (maybe product is deffective?!??!) after installing batteries, shaper part &#x27;DOES NOT&#x27; stay connected to battery part....so i have to constantly stop shaping to re-try and re-connect...(super pain....) so I&#x27;m gonna try using some type of tape so this kit will do its job....***returning it &amp; trying o get another one is such a hassle*** :O .....SUPER DISSAPOINTED!!!!</li>
    <li> I have had your product, Nail Shaper Kit, for a little over a month and I have replaced batteries twice already.  At first it   just went on and off, but now it is not working at all.  I would like a new one.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I use it for hobbies, might try it for nails.  But it works great for taking off burrs on clay work.</li>
    <li> Weeeeak! i didnt like it at all no power and didnt do anything to the nails. please pass on this</li>
    <li> The product is not working when I get it and I need to return it. I don&#x27;t think they did any QC on this product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful kit for home nail care.</li>
    <li> i am very disapointed, it does not work at all. can somebody recomend me what to do? you can contact me on  iko_miko@mail.ru</li>
    <li> I have one of these myself and really like it so I bought some for my daughters.  It is very simple to use and the batteries last a long time.</li>
    <li> I only &amp;#34;tried&amp;#34; to use it maybe 3 times and it won&#x27;t even come on anymore. The top part won&#x27;t stay connected to the bottom after putting the batteries inside. The bits don&#x27;t even file nails very well. I hate that I wasted money on this</li>
    <li> It does not work  even after the battery  I Ankhaddat this product to to bad&lt;br /&gt;i hate it so much</li>
    <li> I love it for the price</li>
    <li> i wish i have not buy them</li>
    <li> Works great product as described</li>
    <li> Several years ago my young son gave this to me as a gift. Battery operated, I thought it&#x27;d be great for travel as I also had a much more expensive electric set. Well... the expensive electric set died within the first year of having it and this little guy just keeps going and going!! I also discovered that most bits fit this as well so I was able to add a few to the set.  I just purchased three of these for the girls in the family so they&#x27;d stop using mine! :) It&#x27;s just an amazing little thing and you can&#x27;t go wrong on the price.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do crap. I found it didn&#x27;t work. So if you need something to work for your nails, and you&#x27;re trying to do it yourself, don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. It doesn&#x27;t buff well, shape well, or really anything well. Maybe if you weren&#x27;t working with acrylic nails. I haven&#x27;t tried it on normal nails. It just didn&#x27;t work for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> For only being about 10 dollars it works really well. I&#x27;m pretty obsessive about my nails and I wanted more equipment to take care of them besides clippers and a file. The pointy metal piece that&#x27;s used for calluses doesn&#x27;t always get all of the skin off and you may have to use clippers to get the rest, but other than that I love it!</li>
    <li> I had one of these before and it broke after several years, so I had to go online to find another one. I use it and it works good. It is worth the money I spent on it. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This item was a Christmas present and my daughter just took it out of the box and it does not work</li>
    <li> love it......this is my third one...accidently broke others</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of nail stuff for my daughter&#x27;s 13th birthday. When she opened the Nail Shaper Kit with travel pouch,none of the five attachments were there. Very dissappointed</li>
    <li> the wife says it works about half the time.the motor overheats if you use it to much at one time.</li>
    <li> I like the shaper to prepare my mail before going to the nail salon it saves time &amp; money and it last</li>
    <li> To my surprise it works really well for my needs.  It&#x27;s not a heavy duty little machine, but it takes care of the little areas needed.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> It was a very nice product that came with other shaving tools. Some would hurt your nail but it worked very well.</li>
    <li> Its not as powerful as a nail shaper kit with AC power and sometimes stops working if you press too hard against nails.&lt;br /&gt;After learning how to use it properly it gets the job done. Build quality could be better but thats just me.</li>
    <li> this is a great kit... i love how it&#x27;s easy to handle and maneuver.. it helps me shape my nails well</li>
