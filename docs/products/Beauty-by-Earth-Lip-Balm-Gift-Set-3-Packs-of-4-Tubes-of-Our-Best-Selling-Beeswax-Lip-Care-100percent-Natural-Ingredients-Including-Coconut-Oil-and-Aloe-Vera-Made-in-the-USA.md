<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this gift set.  If you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re obsessed with lip balm but you don&#x27;t like a bunch of weird synthetic ingredients, you&#x27;ll really like this.  The flavors are great and the feel of the lip balm is smooth and silky.  This is something that would work great for a gift for someone who can&#x27;t leave the house without chapstick (like me, haha). The packaging is really nice and very compact.  I&#x27;m not giving mine as a gift set, but it would work perfectly even with just a rustic twine bow or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like the image shows, you&#x27;ll get four tubes of peppermint and then eight tubes of other assorted flavors.  My favorite is Asian pear.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It arrived in a cute little box and is all ready to gift to someone. And these chap sticks are great. I literally keep one in my purse, next to my bed, bathroom, car, my workplace, etc. They do not dry your lips out. I very much recommend Beauty by Earth chap sticks...especially the peppermint flavor.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Beauty by Earth&#x27;s products. They have great quality and organic products that actually do the job! I bought their chapstick a month ago and l love how smooth my lips feel and it doesn&#x27;t have nasty ingredients like other chapsticks do. This gift set is beautifully packaged and makes a great gift. I have already ordered one for my mom for mothers day as her lips get dry as mine do. My favorite flavor is the vanilla one but it is fun to mix it up and I love having all the choices. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm so what can be better than a package of 12?! lol I personally thing this would make a great gift for any female friend, co-worker, family, etc. Maybe even part of a gift basket of beauty product or something.</li>
    <li> Love all the flavors and the set is great! Would be a perfect stocking stuffer or small gift for someone. The packaging is very nice.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Beauty by Earth Lip Balms.  I was a strict Burts Bees fan, but I think that Beauty By Earth is better! BbE feels lighter while still moisturizing and the flavors have an amazing taste to them as well.  The only thing is that I wish there was a way to buy just one flavor as I am obsessed with the Asian Pair but can only get it in a set with 3 other flavors!</li>
    <li> This is such a great little gift set. I love that they are all natural and smell great. And they leave my lips well moisturized and soft!</li>
    <li> I am not a Lip Balm Person...but after Trying these in a Smaller Quantity...I HAD to have them!! They are AMAZING!! NOT Sticky and Thick like a lot of lip balms and they go on SO Smooth and Evenly. My Favorite is the Pear, just because I Love that scent. You don&#x27;t have to Keep Re-Applying these numerous times per day as they Really do the job of moisturizing your lips after just one application!  I received this Lip Balm Set  for with a Discount in Price for an honest Review and since I had purchased some before, I was THRILLED with the deal. I would NOT give a Thumbs up to a product if I didn&#x27;t REALLY Like it !! These are THAT Good!!</li>
    <li> Best chapstick i have used. My lips are never dry they alwys feel moist. Best item out for lips!!💋</li>
    <li> These are the best!  I love these lip balms.  The price is great, the scents are wonderful, and the quality is top notch.  These lip balms are as good a quality as other comparable balms such as Bert&#x27;s Bees.  You don&#x27;t have to constantly reapply them, they go on smoothly and easily, and they smell terrific.  I have gifted some of these tubes and everyone to which I have given one tells me how much he or likes them.  My favorite is the Pomegranate.  I love them all, but that one is my absolute favorite!  I simply adore all of these, tho, and the fact that they have a nice flavour just makes them irresistible to me.  I keep a tube in my car, my desk, my purse, my nightstand, and in each of my jackets. I will be buying more of these as gifts and for myself.</li>
    <li> The lip balms have become a part of my everyday beauty routine. I most love that I do not have constantly reapply and that the products contain ingredients that I recognize.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm set. I enjoy the variety and it is a great product. My absolute favorite is still the peppermint.</li>
    <li> i hate using the regular chap sticks because of all the chemicals they contain so I usually have chapped lips during the dry weather, however, these lip balms don&#x27;t have that and leave my lips soft and hydrated, and with this gift set, I can share the goods with my friends, definitely happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Here my review ☺my granddaughters love this lip palm I got the 12 pack for just shipping that&#x27;s a huge savings for me I love it ☺&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks amazon</li>
    <li> Love these lip balms.  There are so many in the package, I am thinking of ordering them for party favors for my next get-together.  I really like how smooth the lip balm feels when it goes on.  I also like, very much, the fact that they are soy free.  The many different flavors are interesting.  That is not the biggest selling point for me, though.  I am just happy with the ingredients and feel of the balm on my lips.  All the different flavors to try is fun and some of them even taste a bit sweet, not just a smell but there is taste to the flavors.  Fun.  I would definitely recommend these to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love these lip balms and my kids do too! They smell and feel great on your lips and don&#x27;t have any junk in the ingredients. All natural and safe for kids.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price for the variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product feels, and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great gift.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome! Previously, I ordered set of 4 and it was amazing. Much different from artificial lip guards. I ordered this one as a gift. Really recommend this product for anyone, who is looking for a good lip balm.</li>
    <li> Amazing Lip Balm! Super moisturizing, and its moisture that lasts. No waxy feel to it and I love the natural ingredients. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love all of the balms! A great set</li>
    <li> Just got these products and am really excited but disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get a green tea flavored one in my assortment. That was one I really wanted to try but I have four peppermint ones, one Asian pear, one grapefruit, two honey, two vanilla, and two acai.</li>
    <li> This lip balm gift set is fabulous. I am already sold on this lip balm. It helps keep my lips soft and moist. I&#x27;ve given some of the lip balms to my friends and their reviews have been positive! They wanted me to order them some but I told them about all the products sold and gave them the website! Awesome!</li>
    <li> This gift set is awesome! My friends loved this gift set and loved the lip balm.</li>
    <li> Love the natural lip balm! Great value</li>
    <li> Beauty by Earth&#x27;s lip balms leave my lips feeling wonderful! I am addicted ...</li>
    <li> First I want to say I&#x27;m a Lip Balm ADDICT!! I use it all day every day!! And when I find one I like, I stick with it and buy multiples of them! I recently ran out and when I saw this deal, I said why not give it a try! I love that these are made coconut oil, beeswax, and aloe! I&#x27;m a huge fan of natural products! Now on to my actual review! These were the BEST lip balms I&#x27;ve ever worn! I literally put it on at night and woke up the next morning with still moist lips! I love it!! The texture glides on so smooth! I hate some other lip balms you get them and they feel try and you have to put on so much and keep reapplying! I literally put Beauty by Earth Lip Balm on like twice a day and that&#x27;s it!! They are amazing! I will be a forever customer, if I ever run out my 12 ;) I&#x27;ve give a couple to my closest family so they could try them as well!! My favorite so far is the vanilla bean! So light and so refreshing!</li>
    <li> The prime reason for ordering this lip balm was as a gift for my daughter.  She usually uses another brand but found yours to be excellent.  I think yours is very good but I prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm. This is my second order from them and I did receive a discount. I love this stuff! Nice on the lips and doesn&#x27;t come off after eating. Like the flavors too.</li>
    <li> These lip balms are awesome! I suffer from dry lips all year round. Most lip balms offer moisturizing effects for a very limited period of time, if at all. These lip balms provide relief for hours. The variety of flavors is an exceptional addition to their spectacular moisturizing ability. In addition to all the great qualities of these lip balms, the natural ingredients contained in each stick make for a brilliant product!</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used.  It is the only one that actually heals my lips and prevents chapping in the first place.  My lips used to chap all the time.  Even with other lip balms, my lips would still peel.  Other chap sticks would just sit on top of my peeling skin.  I&#x27;d basically have soft peeling lips.  Every few days, I would have to rub a new layer of skin off in the shower.  But ever since switching to Beauty by Earth, I no longer have to do that.  My lips have nearly stopped peeling and I never get cracked or bleeding lips.  Seriously, this is the best lip balm ever.  Also I love the 100% natural ingredients and the smells/flavors are all really nice.  I got the gift set for myself to try them all out.</li>
    <li> Awesome lip balms! Goes on smooth, no unhealthy chemicals, they are not sticky like some others, the scents are perfect - not too strong, and they last well. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE. LOVE THIS GIFT SET! I already loved the lip balm and now being able to get it in the gift set I am off the wall happy! They  are just the right size for graduation gifts, small birthday gifts , or getting yourself a variety of al the favors !  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love anything by Beauty by Earth.  This package is one of the best I have ever come across.  The flavor variety is wide, the flavors are distinct without being overwhelming, and the feel of the balm on your lips is light but moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a few of the of the tubes to work with me and shared with my co-workers.  They all loved them and said they would be ordering some in the future.  We all agreed it&#x27;s a great price for a superior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, BBE, for giving us such a wonderful deal!</li>
    <li> Amazing gift pack of lip balms. I am really enjoying the Green Tea one, and my son loves the honey.  Goes on very smooth, lasts a pretty long time. lots of yummy scents in this pack.  Perfect for gifting and sharing.</li>
    <li> I got an amazing deal on these from a friend! I am SO glad I did, they are SO amazing! My lips are always chapped, and this has helped me so much, and the choice of flavors is awesome! I can carry a different one everywhere! My car, my purse, my job, my room...I have them everywhere now! I couldn&#x27;t imagine my lips without this lip balm now! Thank you SO much for an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Anyone reading this review! All these lip balms are amazing! I&#x27;ve ordered just about every flavor and loved every single one! This balm doesn&#x27;t have any crazy additives and is the only thing that helps my usually dry and cracked lips! So do yourself a favor and buy this. You will NOT be disappointed!</li>
    <li> love it. really feels nice on your lips. love the different flavors.</li>
    <li> So many flavors to choose from. Love the way it goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May even give some away for gifts.</li>
    <li> Best ChapStick ever. It smells so good and works so wel . Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Thanks so much! This was a wonderful deal!!  The lip balm is awesome!! Even my husband uses it and he hates that girly stuff :)  thanks!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure i&#x27;d like these to be honest. I am a loyal Burt&#x27;s Bee lip balm wearer. I tryed these out though because it was a good deal and the bow looked so cute that they came in. First impression the box was just as adorable as I had thought but the packaging for the chapstick itself was not as nice. The packaging on the tubes is cheap looking, like maybe they print and apply the labels at home. The chap stick dosen&#x27;t have the greatest smell but upon actually trying them I was impressed. The honey is subtle but smells good and is the best one. I like that they are much creamier than others. It does seem like they might melt if you carry them with you on a sunny day. When you apply they give your lips a glossy shine and soften them a lot. If they improved the smells and had nicer packaging they would be much better.</li>
    <li> This lip balm has become my newest addiction! I love the way it feels on my lips and love all the flavores. This gift box is perfect for bridal shower favors or even baby shower favors. Def recommend!</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this companies Lip Balm in the past. I like it a lot. It doesn&#x27;t have that plastic taste that i find other companies have. The flavors are nice and subtle and quite tasty!. When i saw they were offering a larger package with all the flavors i jumped on it. I am one of those people who lose my chapstick constantly. so now i have plenty. i put a few in my car, at my office, on my night stand etc.&lt;br /&gt;I am covered.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used, I gave it as a gift and they loved it enough they gave me a tube to try.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. I love this brand and I love these lip balms. They go on so smoothly and taste great!</li>
    <li> Love the many flavored balms in this gift set. Actually rather than gifting 1 person with this, I&#x27;m splitting it between my daughters and myself. There is so much to choose from: peppermint, vanilla bean, green tea, asian pear, acai &amp; goji berry and another new flavor I gave away already. What a great price for 12 tubes of the best lip balm made! It doesn&#x27;t feel waxy like some that are made &amp;#34;with bees in mind&amp;#34; nor does it leave you wanting  to apply more within a few minutes. It stays on, yet not overbearingly so, and the flavors are great! They even have unflavored if you want to go to dinner with it on. I just love Beauty by Earth&#x27;s products, I know I can trust them to be pure and wholesome for my entire family with ingredients we all can trust. ANd BTW it works! my lips are not chapped anymore but smooth and supple. Try it you;ll see!</li>
    <li> What a fantastic gift set!! I&#x27;ve tried all the flavors and love each and every one. I gave a few away since you get more than one of each scent. I&#x27;m already a fan of beauty by earth products so I knew these would be wonderful:) will definitely be buying again for stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> Got these in the mail today.  Tried only one variety so far today but I like it.  Wish there was a better variety but that doesnt change the fact that these are a good product.</li>
    <li> I usually hate lip balms. They never really felt comfortable for me, especially after reading some of the ingredients. Then I found EOS and while I liked it, I didn&#x27;t like some of their flavors. I thought it was my only option until I found Beauty By Earth&#x27;s lip balms. I have so many right now that I gave some to my sisters and mother. Considering giving one to my father but he might not want to use them, haha! Besides that, customer service is great, flavors are great, and my lips feel very hydrated after using them! Will buy more in the future when my 15 tubes or so finishes. I love the Vanilla Bean the most!</li>
    <li> These lip balms are great. They moisten and comfort your lips very well. You can tell from the feel of them that they are made with all natural ingredients. They&#x27;re great quality. I&#x27;ve given out a couple different lip balms to my friend and they&#x27;ve also enjoyed them.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of flavors for the gift set. Its a cute box that holds them and I loved it. Very easy to carry and pack if traveling.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm!!  It goes on smooth, not sticky or thick like some lip balms.  It will cure chapped lips overnight!!!  I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> Great lip balm! Leaves lips smooth and soft and it lasts for awhile. It came with 4 tubes of peppermint. I am not a huge peppermint fan so I wish it would&#x27;ve came with other flavors. However, the flavors that were included tasted great. Definitely recommend. A great gift for someone that uses a lot of lip balm or someone like me that loses them daily.</li>
    <li> Keeps my lips from chapping and then bleeding.  Bought 12 pack for my wife as she was taking absconding with my tubes.</li>
    <li> excellent product. I never thought that I would like this because it was all natural but I tried the pepermint and the flavor is so good, you want to lick it out of your lips. Its last long and it keeps your lips without cracks on winter.</li>
    <li> I absolutely am in love with these chap sticks. I have never found one until now that doesn&#x27;t leave my lips more chapped. It goes on smoothly and stays on for a long time. It just leaves my lips soft and moisturized as it wears off. I also love the scent and taste of all of them. None of that chemical taste at all. It&#x27;s a major bonus that it&#x27;s all natural and gluten free. That&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s easy to find. The packaging is gorgeous and I love that it&#x27;s compact but really cute. I will definitely be getting several of these for my sisters and friends as well as myself. I&#x27;ll never buy another type of chap stick again!</li>
    <li> This product was received exclusively for reviewing purposes. The evaluation of the product had been conducted independently with no external influences from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product set is presented in a thin cardboard box and contains 12 balms;  4 peppermint, 3 honey, 2 vanilla bean, 1 acai &amp; goji berry, 1 green tea and 1 grapefruit pomegranate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each balm tube is 0.15oz in size and this makes them average sized. They are made of 100% natural ingredients with no petroleum, parabens, mineral oil, soy or any other undesirable chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they are different in nature the application is the same as your standard lip balm; apply  as needed to dry or chapped lips or as a base for lip colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use I found that the roll out mechanisms worked well, were very pleasant and fresh on the lips and worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I had never thought about using natural lip balms before I&#x27;m certainly glad that I&#x27;ve been introduced to them as I will be putting less undesirable chemicals in my body whilst achieving the same benefits of normal lip balms.</li>
    <li> This assortment of lip balms is seriously amazing!! So many delicious and genius flavors and concoctions! There&#x27;s something for everyone in here!</li>
    <li> Love love love this lip balm.  I have already given a review of the Beauty by Earth Original lip balm.  I must say I threw out all my other lip balms after using this for awhile.  I have had so much trouble finding a lip balm that doesn&#x27;t either taste terrible or just plain not help.  So, finally have found one that works and tastes/feels good - I am hooked.  Now all these flavors - wow!  Of course I like some more than others and haven&#x27;t had a chance yet to even try them all....  But the confession is....while I got this as a gift pack I just couldn&#x27;t part with 12 whole tubes of this stuff!  So, I kept it.  Oh well, some things are too good to share!!</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used. I have been on a search for a new lip balm since they change the formulation of kiss my face lip balm that I used before.  I finally found a better replacement. This is the best combination of natural ingredients I have come across and feels so good on my lips. Smells good with no yucky taste, in fact it actually tastes good. I have recommended this to all my sisters and friends. My family loves it -  so thankfully I can order this larger assorted box since they are always taking my lip balm&#x27;s. ❤️</li>
    <li> I love the Lip Balm gift set!</li>
    <li> These lip balms work so much better than Chapstick or Burt&#x27;s Bees! I can really feel them moisturizing my chapped lips and the effect lasts for hours unlike other products that wear off quickly with food or drink. Love them! Thanks for giving me the chance to try your products at discount price with review!</li>
    <li> I love this chapstick! All of the flavors are great and they make my lips nice and soft.</li>
    <li> THIS SET WAS A BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES THEM...THANK YOU FOR WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  I&#x27;LL BE BACK TO ORDER ANOTHER SET FOR ME!!  LINDA ;)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip stuff of all time. I have stopped using anything else. This keeps my lips moisturized and feeling good.</li>
    <li> So far so good! The one I opened (grapefruit pomegranate) is amazing. Smells good enough to eat. The lip gloss is really soft and glides on the lips easily.&lt;br /&gt;I have to resist the urge to lick my lips because of how sweet it taste.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to try the other lip balms.</li>
    <li> I previously bought the 4 pack of lip balm and loved that they were selling a gift box for ALL the different flavors. I had to jump on board and I love the product!</li>
    <li> I love love love my beauty by earth lip balm! I think the gift set is to adorable! I love there&#x27;s 12 tubes and all of them are different! I just opened my first one and tried it out. I love how smooth it goes on my lips. I love that I have a variety of different ones!</li>
    <li> I love this gift set! I ordered it for my sister because I love this lip balm so much! It totally handled my pealing lips I had!</li>
    <li> Get set. Have them in every drawer of the house.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm, I mean LOVE it. I always have it on me wherever I go and all around the house. I&#x27;m basically in lip balm heaven right now and even tho it&#x27;s technically an adorable gift set, I&#x27;m keeping it all for me! I&#x27;ve now tried all the flavors from this company and this set is s perfect mix of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their packaging is always on point; the brown cardboard looks so earthy and natural. They look great in gift baskets. Highly recommend as a gift to anyone!</li>
    <li> I purchased one set for me and one for my sister (we&#x27;re lip balm junkies). Since using it, my lips don&#x27;t get as dry as they used to. I like the choice in flavors, and especially like the one I&#x27;m using now, grapefruit pomegranate!!</li>
    <li> I received a couple of these lipy balms in a previous order and loved them.  All natural ingredients are important to me when it comes to my skin and in this case my lips.  When I had the chance to order more at a great price I jumped on it.  I now have enough for all my coat pockets, my purse, my desk at work , car and some to share with my friends and family.  Love love love Beauty by Earth, would i buy it again?  You can count on it !!</li>
    <li> i was looking for a bundle like this thanks</li>
    <li> I would say 12 tubes is a way too many for a gift set. I prefer unsweeten lip balm, the flavors are too sweet for me, but the product by itself is good.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue that it does not contain SPF. I would like my lip balm with at least SPF15 during the summer months.</li>
    <li> This is actually my third purchase of these balms, because the first was so good I wanted to try the other varieties. I LOVE these lip balms and so do my daughter. They smell great and taste great too, which is a plus. The honey is mild and for men or people who prefer something closer to unflavored/unscented it&#x27;s perfect. I gave them to my sons and everyone is happy :-)  The mint is minty and has a bit of a tingle to it, the vanilla reminds me of oreo cookie filling, and the exotic fruits are exactly what you&#x27;d expect - sweet and fruity. They also last a long time so you aren&#x27;t having to reapply them every 5 minutes, so that makes the tubes hang around for a few months- all around a great buy!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this gift set!  It is the perfect gift for any lip balm lover!  All the flavors are amazing!  I have one in my car, my desk drawer and in every room in my house!</li>
    <li> Love these chapsticks, can&#x27;t go wrong with natural products! Smell good and really hydrates and heals chapped lips. Leaves lips very soft and after a couple of days your lips will be healed and looking great!</li>
    <li> This gift set is absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend it as a gift for anyone who loves lip balm. Luckily, I bought this for myself :) Beauty by Earth is my go to lip balm. All the flavors are so deliciously yummy. Green tea is my favorite. My lips stay moist all day. Buy this now.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lip balm! Love the set and the great flavors.</li>
    <li> OK, so you can believe what everyone else says here.  These lip balms are amazing!  I had never heard of Beauty by Earth, but the reviews were so complimentary, I just had to try them.  I am using them multiple times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I should add that Beauty by Earth reached out to me after the sale to see if I was satisfied.  That was very appreciated!</li>
    <li> This lip balm set is wonderful.  I received it as part of a promotion. The balm goes on smooth and every different scent smells wonderful and fresh. This would make a great gift for someone that loves lip balms.</li>
    <li> Love these. They keep my lips moisturized and are great tasting!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the assortment of flavors. Best lip balm you could EVER buy!!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best lip balms I have ever tried. It is super smooth and all the flavors smell and taste great! The green tea one is definitely my favorite, because it smells just like green tea and gives my lips a fresh feel. I love how it goes on, because with most lip balms made in this way, the top is hard and it usually has hard edges, but these tubes are just so smooth and don&#x27;t have the hard edges. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who was looking for a great lip balm.</li>
    <li> I really love all of their lip balm. I think my favorite is the acai berry :) They are all great and work very well though! No more chapstick for me! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love everything from this brand! I was super excited when they came out with this gift set, because I love all the flavors of their lip balm. This gift set was the perfect addition to a beauty basket I put together for a relative, and she loved it!!!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful! The best lip balm I have ever purchsed. I absolutely love Beauty by Earth!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this lip balm.  very light while still providing that moisturizing coverage!  I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm nut.. have one in my purse, desk drawer, on nighstand, desk... every coat pocket - you get the drift... Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these lip balm&#x27;s!!  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is trying to decide which is my favorite!!  Love the peppermint one and you receive three pediment in the set!!  Was happy to have gotten a chance to review this product!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome lip balms. They feel smooth and they LAST! I don&#x27;t feel like I need to reapply super often like I do with other balms. And I like how they have nice, subtle tastes/flavors/scents that aren&#x27;t overpowering. I can see them lasting a long time too. No complaints here :)</li>
