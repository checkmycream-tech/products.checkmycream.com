<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin has never been so dry as this year and I just couldn&#x27;t manage to hydrate my skin. I found the heaviest product out there because that&#x27;s what I thought was the problem, that it had to be a thick cream. I used the entire container with no results! I started to read about jojoba oil and picked up a small bottle, started using it, and found it beneficial. Then learned about almond oil and had to try it. I read so many positive reviews about almond oil; I was anxious for it to arrive. I received my almond oil in just a few days, sooner than expected. I love it! Surprised how light it feels and how my shin absorbed it with no tacky/sticky feeling remaining after using it. The skin on my legs no longer feels tight or hurts. I believe I am well on my way back to soft &amp; healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and struggle to find moisturizers that adequately moisturize my skin. This oil does a great job- it’s natural with no added scents. Can be used on the face as well.</li>
    <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy. Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
    <li> I treated myself to these oils based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. I absolutely love them! They are luxurious! I use them for my hair and entire body. I have noticed an improvement in my scalp because I have psoriasis and often get flaky hair. The bottoms of my feet get dry and cracked from so much beach time being barefoot.. I noticed immediately how much smoother the rough parts became. You actually feel like your skin is healthier. I would recommend these to anyone for overall skin care and hair care. I won&#x27;t use any other skin products from now on</li>
    <li> I love the product, I have been using it for a few days now and I can see the difference in my skin.  I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I started to receive many compliments on my skin almost as soon as I started using it.  Makes my skin very soft and glowing.  I will definitely order this again.  Please do a subscribe and save for this item.</li>
    <li> Bottled arrived with a broken lid and oil seeped out of the plastic wrap and onto the other items in my shipment.  Apparently, the bottle had been exposed to air for some time - because, additionally, the oil smelled rancid.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.  I will say that, if I could have gotten over the smell, it did make my skin soft - couldn&#x27;t avoid getting it on my while cleaning up other items.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly and completely.&lt;br /&gt;Non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Not tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, works best on body; extra-dry hands required a healing balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for sweet almond scent, this is unscented.&lt;br /&gt;If you like unscented, this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is very good stuff, after only two days I can feel the difference and dandruff is not as visible!</li>
    <li> I have two children: a baby girl and a six year old boy. Both of them have dry skin/ eczema problems. In the beginning, with the first one, I would use baby lotion on his skin but it didn&#x27;t help the eczema. Also, I found out that baby lotion actually has lots of questionable ingredients, even the &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ones. The pediatrician recommended good old petroleum jelly, which helped the eczema. However I was still not happy because the jelly still had a very industrial oil smell to it. I know it says it&#x27;s refined and &amp;#34;purified&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t like the idea of putting it on my sweet baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only solution that I have found is to use natural oils with essential oils. So far I have tried Jojoba oil and this sweet almond oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sweet almond oil is wonderful; both children use it and no reactions, nothing. It goes on so well and makes their skin so soft. Each of them has their own little bottle and my son loves it that mommy made it just for him. I put several drops of lemon grass for his (because that is the scent he loves best) and a few drops of lavender for my baby girl. With my baby, I give her a bath, give her a little all over massage with the sweet almond oil with lavender and she gets so relaxed. Makes bedtime a lot less stressful and she drops right off to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I really like this oil. My only complaint (and this seems common with many oils, not just this one) is when I received it, the outside of the bottle was very oily, as if some had seeped out during shipping.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did receive a free sample for review, however I did try my best to be honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> Love this not oily. I add this to my lotion because I have really dry skin and the combination works great !!!</li>
    <li> The almond oil was excellent in quality, application, and in results.  And also an excellent value when compared to competing products.  I recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> Received one bottle instead of 3 bottles as shown in ad I will not order from this any more if they want to misrepresent what the item is on the order page so I only received one of three as shown! Pretty mad about this. Hope this is made right and corrected.</li>
    <li> I am using it daily on my baby who is 5 months old now. This has made her skin very soft N keeps it well moisturized. I see a dramatic change in her skin within 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I just received it and put a little on my legs which are always dry and flaking and on my dry hands... right away they became smooth, oil soaks in almost immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy. I am sold.</li>
    <li> I like the shine it gives my skin, There are many good over the counter products for dry skin. This product does not smell and is not greasy. That&#x27;s a big plus for me. It also really soaks into the skin. And, you get a lot for the money!</li>
    <li> I purchased this basically for my wife to use. Due to her being a diabetic, her skin is very dry. The Sweet Almond oil is light and none greasy and she loves the way it makes her skin feel.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Great product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff a Dab on your hair didn&#x27;t leave it greasy and a little on face and body</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have been using it everywhere on my body and even my hair. It soaks into the skin and does not leave it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my hair and scalp after shampooing my hair and it leaves a nice sheen. I have other wonderful products but this is a total product in one.&lt;br /&gt;The seller e-mailed a lot of information about almond oil which was very informative. I heartedly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I dont know all the uses of this oil so far i use it as a skin moisturizer great not greasy at all..can this be eaten????I will order again...</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of almond oil. I have always used coconut oil on my skin. I have seen great benefits with almond oil concerning dry skin and I love how quickly it dry/is absorbed. The bottle has not leaked at all.</li>
    <li> Great product, great customer service and follow- up and reasonably priced. I am definitely ordering more from this company!! I love this almond oil. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Nice clean product no junk added</li>
    <li> I tried to order this product 2 times and both time it was damaged ... so I never even seen product make it to my door step.. I will not order for the&lt;br /&gt;3rd. time...I really wanted tis product very disapointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a week on my body and hair and I love it.  It&#x27;s easily absorbed and makes my skin soft and my hair shiny without that greasy look and feel.  I&#x27;ve tried Hemp oil too which is also nice but I hate that it&#x27;s perishable and I have to refrigerate it.  The fact is I like to pop a small container of it in my gym bag so I have it handy to use after my shower or when I&#x27;m in the dry sauna to use as a beauty treatment. Also this doesn&#x27;t have any discernible smell to it at all which I like better as well.</li>
    <li> A+ Transaction, very nice product!!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Almond oil smells so good! I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect. The oil is super, well, oily. Very liquidy. It came out of the bottle very quickly, so be careful. I plan to use it with essential oils as a carrier oil. I love that you get such a big bottle, so if you are clumsy like me, you wont be screwed if you use to much at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this at a discounted price in order to give my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Arrived leaking everywhere, The top seal was not sealed with paper or aluminum foil. Does not have the odor of almond oil--I doubt it is almond oil. Not worth the price. I was sent only one bottle and the add looks like three.</li>
    <li> I like the baby oil better.  Seems to not moisturize as well. Considering the cost I will stick to the baby oil. Rather disappointed. Oh and even though it was &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; it leaked all over the box.  Thank goodness nothing else was shipped with it.</li>
    <li> This oil is very good for skin, I never applied any oil on my face because it¡¯s very sensitive. But, when I used this oil, my skin is glowing also helpful to reduce acne. I&#x27;ll give 10/10 to this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting it to have a sweeter odor. It really has none at all, but I guess that is ok</li>
    <li> I have bottles and bottles of lotions all over my home from years and years of searching for a product that will soak in and actually soften my dry skin. I ordered this Sweet Almond Oil from Amazon for my thinning hair and kept rubbing the excess into my hands and arms. It soaked into my skin so quickly and left my skin soft and silky, not greasy. I continued using the oil all over my body and my legs are loving it, as well! I&#x27;m recovering from a septic infection, so it&#x27;s going to take a while before results are in on the hair growth, but I&#x27;ll let you know! Great product for your thirsty skin!!! :)</li>
    <li> This is high quality oil and I knew it would be because Eve Hansen wouldn&#x27;t sell it if it wasn&#x27;t. I used this oil for the first time in my homemade lip balm and I love it. My previous lip balm recipe didn&#x27;t call for almond oil and it was not as hydrating as the one I made with it. Eve Hansen has great products and great customer service.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. This oil is my new go-to for moisturizing my skin and hair. I purchased it after reading about the great benefits of almond oil. I was previously part of the coconut oil bandwagon, but found it too greasy, sometimes too smelly, and in a few instances, it actually caused my skin to break out (I have pretty good skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive--coconut oil was the first thing in a LONG time that consistently caused me to break out). From what I could find, sweet almond oil provides many of the same benefits as coconut oil minus the greasiness and smell (I have tried organic coconut oil that is scentless, but it&#x27;s still too greasy and the consistency in one jar can vary a lot between smooth and grainy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this brand because from reading the label, it was the most transparent---that is, it seemed to be the &amp;#34;cleanest&amp;#34; sweet almond oil and the label didn&#x27;t contain a lot of puffery. So far, I&#x27;ve been using it as an after-shower moisturizer and moisturizer for my hair. The oil doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin, and a little goes a long way, so I find that I have to be conservative in how much I use or I&#x27;ll be waiting all day for it to absorb fully into my skin. The same was true when I applied it to my hair. I noticed after blow-drying my hair that it had a beautiful sheen to it and didn&#x27;t feel the slightest bit greasy, clammy, or heavy. I attributed this to the sweet almond oil, as it was the only product change in my regimen. I&#x27;ll continue using this product and update my review if necessary, but so far, it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
    <li> I use this for my hair it work wonders far surpassing coconut oil. Plus it is very very light weight and makes my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful oil.  The very best I have tried.  I will order again.&lt;br /&gt;It had leaked thru to the outside of the box.  It was packaged very good.</li>
    <li> I had never used almond oil before but am absolutely in love with this product.  I love it on my hair [ makes it so shiny!] on my skin, even my face.  Does not clog my pores or feel greasy on skin or hair.  Will definitely be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> Great oil!  Wife loves it.  The smell is almost not there and the little we do smell is pleasant.  Superior product that we will but again when almost out!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I have tried many different carrier oils , olive oil, coconut oil,other brands of sweet almond and was not satisfied with them. I ordered this one and love it. I find this is very light. I have extremely dry skin and horrible cracked heels.  I tried this and it is amazing. I even use it on my face and my husband noticed how much smoother my face looks, I have only been using this recipe for a week.  I mix 1/2 cup Sweet Almond oil, 20 drops Vitamin E oil, 10 drops Frankincense oil, 10 drops tree oil and 5 drops Blue Cypress. Just take some on my finger and rub it between my hands and apply to my face and feet.</li>
    <li> I love almond oil for an all over body moisturizer! It does not leave a sticky residue and is absorbed quickly. Great price!</li>
    <li> An excellent product and vendor. Great experience all around.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
    <li> This is a very smooth oil , and it smells clean and fresh . I will buy it again for sure .</li>
    <li> I love it. Makes my skin very soft. Soaks in very well. Feels great!</li>
    <li> The Almond Oil makes my skin nice and smooth when I get out of the shower. Very nice and it does not have an Almond scent in case you wanted something that did not have a strong smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with this sweet almond oil.  I&#x27;ve been dedicated to coconut oil for some time, but I find it dries out my skin a bit, which is the opposite effect it&#x27;s supposed to have.  This almond oil spreads easily, smells nice (very subtle) and feels lighter than my coconut oil.  I use it every other day on my super dry skin (legs and arms mostly) and it lasts for over 24 hours before my poor dehydrated skin is cracked again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my hair a few times, but I have very fine straight hair, so I have to use oils very limited.  It washes out easily with shampoo after a night of conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite use for this is eye make-up remover.  It doesn&#x27;t sting or bother my eyes like some products, it&#x27;s all natural and just wipes away the make up with pulling on my skin.  It gives me major moisture around my eyes that I love and I leave the remnants of the oil on over night, waking to soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a large bottle that will last me quite some time.  It&#x27;s plastic and I keep it on my bathroom counter for easy access.  It does drip around the sides if you&#x27;re not careful, so keep a washcloth to wipe it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and appreciate the opportunity to review such a high quality product that I&#x27;m definitely adding to my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I love this product very much....and customer service is impeccable.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. After reading Amazon reviews I decided to try it. This great product does moisturize and I love that my face is not terribly shining. It is for a minute but it does not last. I have not been using it long but I plan to use it daily.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a carrier for essential oils, I have yet to try it as such but I have high hopes. I did however use it in my super dry overprocessed hair after a shower on a whim and it really made my hair soft and shiny. Would buy it again just for that. Love so far and cant wait to try it as a massage oil.</li>
    <li> Product received as described!</li>
    <li> Extremely high quality oil!  Not greasy, very effective moisturizing and smoothing for skin.  I was expecting it to smell more like almonds, and I didn&#x27;t care much for the smell, so I ordered some almond scent oil and added it to this oil and now it is fantastic!  I use it all the time and am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Great product - very light oil that has eliminated my dry skin.  Great customer service as well.  Very happy with my purchase!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it. Get a rub down after swimming. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. And best of all, a little goes a long way. I will certainly buy it again.</li>
    <li> What a fine discovery this Sweet Almond Oil is!  It really does sink in beautifully, and this is the kind of thing that is SO much better for us than moisturizers with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Leaked during shipping... I expected there to be a wonderful almond scent... This is unscented</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day.</li>
    <li> I will recommend it to everyone .BEST OIL !!!! great for your hair and body</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t vimprove my skin rather started getting black heads..but it works for my hair..</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I applied Eve Hansen&#x27;s Almond Oil on my skin and it left my skin feeling very smooth and lightly fragrant. The almond oil has a light, sweet nutty scent. I like it because the scent is not overpowering. It also has a light honey amber color. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and it absorbs into the skin​ very well.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT I love it.  My skin was never this soft</li>
    <li> This is great stuff...I use almond oil all over my body while still wet from the shower and it soaks in nicely (plus sheds the water faster) and leaves me soft as a kitten.</li>
    <li> Received this oil to review, and it&#x27;s great. Very nice quality, feels great on the skin, and smells great too. Mostly been using it as a massage oil, and very easy to add a drop or two of essential oils if you&#x27;d like to change the scent. Great product, great seller!</li>
    <li> I was interested in this oil because many of the natural body care recipes I am interested in trying suggested it as the best carrier oil for body products. I was surprised that it has no scent, and a little disappointed because I love the scent of almonds and had planned to make almond-scented items. Nevertheless, the unscented product is amenable to more uses by adding different essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well, is very rich and oily when first applied but quickly is absorbed into the skin. A very luxurious product, and as of this review, at a great price. Mine leaked a small amount in the box.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to review this almond oil at a reduced price in exchange. That said, this is a great product. This product can be used anywhere dryness is a problem. I personally have had wonderful results with this product. This almond oil is light, not heavy as with other oils. I am using this on my dry cracked heels. My heels are getting so much softer and moisturized. I will  continue using nightly. Great product!</li>
    <li> Oh Sweet, sweet Almond, I just love it! This almond oil is just perfect, you can use from head to toes. Eve Hansen delivers high quality products and this sweet almond oil isn&#x27;t the exception, it&#x27;s 100% pure and natural, cold pressed and undiluted. I&#x27;ve been using this oil in my hair and also on my skin, this works wonders. It leaves my skin soft and moisturized and my hair just loves it. I use it as a pre-poo and everyday as hair polisher. My hair is very shinny and moisturized. This almond oil is very good for dry hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these at a discount in exchange for unbiased review.</li>
    <li> THIS OIL MELTS IN YOUR SKIN AND IS NOT GREASY. I USED IT WITH SOME OF MY PERFUME AND SMELLED GREAT ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;THE OIL DOES NOT HAVE SMELL TO IT SO YOU CAN USE IT WITH ANY FRAGRANCE OR LOTION.</li>
    <li> Good quality, arrived fast. I use this in my oil cleansing method and my hair oil and body oil mixtures. Great oil.</li>
    <li> Have used the product for a few days and am enjoying the results.</li>
    <li> I love it, i have been using it on my face  my all body.  Tanks so much  Eve Hansen, your customer service is exellent</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect oil to massage my clients for the last 20 years!!  I was so happy to discover this sweet Almond oil.  It is a light oil, not too greasy with a smooth glide, perfect for massaging.  I love it. My clients love it and they feel the difference on their skin and the absorption of the oil.  It is on the pricey side though, and so I cannot use it all the time.  Its a shame they don&#x27;t make a more economical size for a better price. Because of this I will have to switch back and forth with a less perfect oil.&lt;br /&gt;It was also very misleading to have 3 bottles shown in the picture, as this is what I though I was getting for the price advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was poor too. In both shipments the oil leaked into the box. But amazon was very obliging and replaced the bottle for me.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now on my hair &amp; skin after the shower and it has made my skin so soft &amp; pretty. Will be ordering some more soon :)</li>
    <li> Came on time and as described. Works well on the skin and not too oily. Wife loves how it feels.</li>
    <li> Be mindful, that this is an order for only ONE singular bottle. NOT 3 as shown.</li>
    <li> exactly as described.  I would recommend to anyone wanting to give an intimate massage.</li>
    <li> Just starting to get into oils and I&#x27;ve already determined that Almond Oil is awesome for the skin. I purchased this Almond oil as the base oil for mixing with other oils (Lavender, Tea Tree, etc.). When the package arrived the Almond oil container had leaked a little so I had to clean it up and doing so resulted in getting it all over my hands so I just rubbed it into my hands. Wow, within minutes I could tell a difference with my hands and how smooth it had made them. The oil dried fast with no after effects but the results were amazing. Since then I&#x27;ve been using it every night and love it. I&#x27;ve given it to the kids for various skin issues including a Tattoo that got infected and acne. The kids stated that their skin was smooth and felt better afterwards. So, will continue to use this oil and when I run out I will definitely be purchasing another bottle or two. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I guess the product is okay the way it&#x27;s shipped was not so good... I had the pleasure of opening a box full of oil but I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you order things online</li>
    <li> Small amount leaked but overall satisfied</li>
    <li> great skin softener for dry skin. I alternate the almond oil with coconut oil for dry skin on arms and lets. It is also great for removing makeup, leaves skin soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Received product quickly, was safely and securely packaged with NO leaking! LOVE almond oil because it has so many uses and this size bottle is just perfect - will last me quite a while. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my almond oil for a week now and I absolutely love it! The delivery was quick within 2 days. I&#x27;ve been using it as a light facial moisturizer and I can already tell the difference in how soft my skin has gotten and my small acne dark spots are slowly disappearing!! I&#x27;ve put some drops of almond oil in my body wash and shampoo, also on my scalp and hair. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this product. There is no scent... This product is better than the Coconut one.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a natural massage oil and I really like it. The scent is pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel and a few dollops go a really long way. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Amazing! This is my second bottle, It makes my skin so soft, I love it especially it&#x27;s pure and natural oil. Fast delivery.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This sweet almond oil is amazing! I was so excited when I found it and the price is fantastic. It has truly made a difference and I will now use nothing else. This will be going on my Amazon wishlist!</li>
    <li> Great massage oil. Works very well and is not super greasy, absorbs into the skin beautifully and smells great. I have also been using this in my hair on the ends because of the severe dryness. It&#x27;s been working wonders without leaving it looking oily. I have used other Almond oils before but this one is top of the line. I would purchase this again and again.... you will LOVE the smell.</li>
    <li> Eve you are amazing. I love this oil and will be buying again. Thanks *kisses*</li>
    <li> First of all, this company is very responsive, sincere and their customer service is awesome.  One of the bottles I received was a little banged up and before I knew it there was a replacement on the way, NO QUESTIONS asked, wow!  The oil is nice and smooth which is what you want in an oil but it absolutely does not leave an oily residue and no odor or after-smell.  It is incredible.  I use it for massages (add a little lavender essence), it is the best product so far and I would definitely re-order from Eve Hansen.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service from the seller</li>
    <li> very good one on skin and hair as well love it and for sure will keep buying it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to use with essential oils.</li>
    <li> very nice massage oil , its silky and not sticky , it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell but it doesn&#x27;t stink makes your body feel silky smooth love it :)</li>
    <li> Best product ever!!!  Love!</li>
    <li> Item arrived in a timely manner and was what I expected.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and I am looking forward to using this with new Essential Oils.  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Shipped on time, good customer service. A little to heavy to use on hair alone. Would recommend using it before a wash.</li>
    <li> very good oil, and will purchase more.</li>
    <li> I recommend this for any DIY recipes.</li>
    <li> I am very selective when it comes to oils and I know when one is of great quality. This is a quality oil. It&#x27;s a large bottle, so it will last you for a very long time. I use it as a &amp;#34;carrier&amp;#34; oil with my essential oils and it works great. There are tons of recipes for organic use of this oil and the possibilities are endless. You will not be disappointed! I received this product at a discounted rate (not free) for my honest, unbiased review. I love this product and I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I could see the difference in my arms almost as soon as I put it on.  Even two hours later, my best friend looked at my hands and arms as we were at lunch and could not believe the change!  I use this on my face and then put on my makeup.  It seems to be &amp;#34;inhaled&amp;#34; by the skin immediately and there is nothing greasy about it.  This is wonderful oil!</li>
    <li> This product is really good. Nice smell and absorb fast without feeling greasy. My bottle got broken in the shipment, and they replaced with a new one immediately. Good customer service!</li>
    <li> For massages this oil is top notch. Glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t soak in the moment you out it in so my husbands hands glide without friction. I&#x27;ve noticed less breakouts on my back after switching from lotion.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the fast delivery after I placed my order, and the follow up email to make sure the order met expectations.  It is my first time to buy sweet almond oil.  I am using it as a moisturizer on my legs and arms and also mixed with lavender essential oil as a mosquito repellant.  I intend to use as massage oil also.</li>
    <li> nice oil. would prefer it be a little more aromatic/scented and wish it had vitamin e/multivitamins. kinda thick to use as a body oil so i use it in relaxing baths instead.</li>
    <li> My skin looks AMAZING!!!!!!  My husband confirmed it.  One day we were out and about, and my husband just said your skin is so radiant!!!!!  He noticed :).  I was so happy with this product.  I noticed the the transition before he did though.</li>
    <li> Works especially well with essential oils. Nice scent without being overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product so I can not say if it has changed anything health wise  or skin wise for me. Just too early to tell.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do like the way product was packaged, and that it is food grade.&lt;br /&gt;I will not have problem buying again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this oil! I use it primarily on my hair and as a carrier oil. It is light weight and really helps to restore my color damaged hair. The need to use heavy conditioning balms is minimized greatly thanks to this product! I also use it with pure lavendar oil on my skin and its just lovely! Not sticky or greasy. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff.  Dry not sticky.  Can be used for multiple things.  I use it for my hair and skin.  Has no scent.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was using this during the winter months to help with my hair, which gets brittle and lifeless thanks to the dry air released by my central heating system.  Before bed I would massage a few drops of this almond oil into my scalp and then let it sit in my hair while I sleep. The next day I would take a shower and afterwards notice that my hair looked thicker, livelier, and really shiny. I&#x27;ve been using almond oil on my face as well, since that also gets dry from allergies at times. I&#x27;ve been a fan of this product since seeing the results, and it&#x27;s a shame that it is currently out of stock because other brands are not nearly as concentrated (or affordable).  Hope the shortage is temporary, I&#x27;m eagerly anticipating it coming back.</li>
