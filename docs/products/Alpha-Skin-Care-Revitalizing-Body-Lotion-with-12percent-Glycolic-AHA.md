### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It does moisturize, but the best thing is that it appears to exfoliate it as well.  </li>
      <li>Great product (esp for the money).</li>
      <li>The product is great.</li>
      <li>I bought the lotion because I have the so called &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on my legs and arms, and this product is supposed to be really good for it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very potent for body acne.</li>
      <li>The bomb for softening aging skin that doesn&#x27;t want to exfoliate on its own.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled.</li>
      <li>I lotion once, mostly twice a day.</li>
      <li>Love this product, and price is worth it!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, wish it would absorb better, but overall, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Skin really felt like silk after first application, more than satisfied</li>
      <li>Amazing product, my skin has completely turned around.  </li>
      <li>it is really good if you use it in winter as long as your skin is dry, but it has not showed any great influence.</li>
      <li>Best lotion ever, keeps the dry bumpy skin on backs of my arm so soft.</li>
      <li>Absorbs fairly quickly, leaves no residual scent,  and is a godsend for keratosis pilaris.  </li>
      <li>Or maybe the bottle I have just doesn&#x27;t have the right texture?</li>
      <li>If You&#x27;re an avid lotion user, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>On a positive note: I favor this brand when it comes to exfoliating, moisturizing and toning of the skin.</li>
      <li>I still am using their Foaming Face Wash, Intensive Serum (weak), and Oil-Free Formula (My favorite). :-)  </li>
      <li>Improving texture of the skin and very moisturizing</li>
      <li>I tried this as my legs have gotten drier as I have gotten older.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Normal moisterizers don&#x27;t  seem to do this.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t light, and doesn&#x27;t absorb in the skin, AT ALL which as a result it comes right back off when your body rubs against other things eg your clothes,</li>
      <li>I live in a high desert climate plus I&#x27;m 57 years old.</li>
      <li>Removes dead skin gently and helps with adult acne,dullness and fine lines.</li>
      <li>Now I just started using it, my picky can still reach the lotion, I wonder when my picky can no long reach it, do I need to prepare a special tool, such as a stick to get it out???</li>
      <li>Plus I hoping it will help clear up my Tinea Vericolor!</li>
      <li>This product has made my skin SO soft and smooth, and is beginning to fade those dark marks.  </li>
      <li>I am AA, lighter skinned with old eczema scars that I have been trying to lighten.  </li>
      <li>really helps my acne on my back!</li>
      <li>So you should be ready to commit for the long haul.</li>
      <li>This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that keeps my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
      <li>This lotion seems to contain just the right amount of glycolic acid needed for all round daily exfoliating.</li>
      <li>At first, it seemed too heavy for my skin as my pores felt suffocated.</li>

    <li> it is really good if you use it in winter as long as your skin is dry, but it has not showed any great influence.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin so I wanted to try this product to see if it would help.  It does moisturize, but the best thing is that it appears to exfoliate it as well.  Normal moisterizers don&#x27;t  seem to do this.  I am going to place another order  soon.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> really helps my acne on my back!</li>
    <li> This lotion seems to contain just the right amount of glycolic acid needed for all round daily exfoliating. At first, it seemed too heavy for my skin as my pores felt suffocated. This changed with time though, and within four weeks, I began to feel the silky smoothness it was bringing to my body. One word of caution: the smoothness seems to decease when you take a break from product. So you should be ready to commit for the long haul.</li>
    <li> I did not regret my purchase, however I won&#x27;t but it again and here&#x27;s why: 1) It isn&#x27;t light, and doesn&#x27;t absorb in the skin, AT ALL which as a result it comes right back off when your body rubs against other things eg your clothes, couch etc. 2) If You&#x27;re an avid lotion user, this isn&#x27;t for you. Mine lasted for 2weeks - almost. I lotion once, mostly twice a day. I&#x27;m was a bit disappointed because: 3) The quantity doesn&#x27;t add up to the price, and the quality is average; In my opinion, It&#x27;s not worth $22.50. 4) I see a difference in my skin appearance especially my hands and feet, as well as around the joint areas. On a positive note: I favor this brand when it comes to exfoliating, moisturizing and toning of the skin. I still am using their Foaming Face Wash, Intensive Serum (weak), and Oil-Free Formula (My favorite). :-)  EDIT: I said I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but I lied. It growing on me now after my last bottle. Plus I hoping it will help clear up my Tinea Vericolor!</li>
    <li> I live in a high desert climate plus I&#x27;m 57 years old. This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that keeps my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
    <li> I tried this as my legs have gotten drier as I have gotten older.  I am amazed at how moisturizing this product is.  I don&#x27;t have to smother my skin a little will do.  I discovered that this product also improves skin texture on my arms and legs.  I used to sun tan alot in my 20&#x27;s and I can see the texture of my skin change.  This product has reversed the sun damage and improved skin texture.  Love this product, and price is worth it!!</li>
    <li> Skin really felt like silk after first application, more than satisfied</li>
    <li> Absorbs fairly quickly, leaves no residual scent,  and is a godsend for keratosis pilaris.  Use it daily or every other day and you will notice a big difference within a week.</li>
    <li> The product is great. But not this price 15 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Just google shopping check, it should be 12~15 dollars instead.</li>
    <li> I do like this body lotion, quite a bit. It is not oily or greasy, yet leaves me feeling moisturized  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, so thankfully found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, my skin has completely turned around.  I am AA, lighter skinned with old eczema scars that I have been trying to lighten.  This product has made my skin SO soft and smooth, and is beginning to fade those dark marks.  I am thrilled.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever, keeps the dry bumpy skin on backs of my arm so soft.</li>
