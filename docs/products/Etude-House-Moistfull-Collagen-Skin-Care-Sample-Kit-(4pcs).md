      <li>came in weeks early and it great.</li>
      <li>am most happy that there are sample kits of Korean cosmetics we can try; Korean cosmetics are high quality products and you can see results quickly (like feeling soft skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgot</li>
      <li>To small , anyway the products are the best!</li>
      <li>I will be buying the full size products.</li>
      <li>Great for my super dry skin!!</li>
      <li>It may work better if you have just oily or normal skin.</li>
      <li>All are similarly gel-like and goes on smoothly and absorbed by skin very easily and quickly and skin feels soft/refreshed.  </li>
      <li>Was a bit light colored for my skin but spread on very well.</li>
      <li>tried these samples on last night and by this morning my skin felt so nice and</li>
      <li>, I love it so far.</li>
      <li>I like the way im able to test it out before i actually commits to buying the full size</li>
      <li>I must comment on the super fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The package also arrived very fast.</li>
      <li>I give this a 5  out of 5 because I feel a difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
      <li>but it is good for people who are not sure about purchasing it and want to try it first.</li>
      <li>Lasted long enough to get a good feel for the products.</li>
      <li>and i really like it.</li>
      <li>If Etude House every stops making this product, I will be really upset.</li>
      <li>I just put the cream on and it makes my skin feel so soft and fresh</li>
      <li>but I think people with dry sensitive skin would benefit even more.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing, small</li>
      <li>My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
      <li>only wish I could get all these products in the full size, not just sample sized.</li>
      <li>I use this after I wash my face because my skin feels super dry.</li>
      <li>It is very soft with the skin and moisturizes well.</li>
      <li>My skin is super sensitive and oily and this product dos not irritates my skin and controls the oil and shine for long time.</li>
      <li>and it felt so soft</li>
      <li>came so early, in two days.</li>
      <li>This is the second sample kit i have tried but for a short while because originally it had a fruity smell (don&#x27;t particularly like strawberry, melons, banana -- love to eat but not appealing with cosmetics for me, EXCEPT lemon, lime, orange -- but reconsidered after a few weeks, and the \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; scent is less bothering and now sense it as a lemony scent.  </li>
      <li>not liquidy like water but clear, thickened watery gel;  emulsion -- also soft gel-like, opaque;  essence -- also gel-like half clear/opaque;  cream -- similar to essence except it is the \\&quot;thickest\\&quot; but</li>

    <li> This product  can leave  you feeling a little  sticky but that could just be my fault  because  there are no English directions.</li>
    <li> To small , anyway the products are the best!</li>
    <li> Smells really good. My sister loves it. I gave it to her as a gift and she uses it all the time, and the collagen works. Thank you ~!</li>
    <li> After being introduced to Korean cosmetics by my friend, i have tried a few sample kits.  This is the second sample kit i have tried but for a short while because originally it had a fruity smell (don&#x27;t particularly like strawberry, melons, banana -- love to eat but not appealing with cosmetics for me, EXCEPT lemon, lime, orange -- but reconsidered after a few weeks, and the \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; scent is less bothering and now sense it as a lemony scent.  Though i haven&#x27;t used it long enough  to rate it&#x27;s effect on my skin, at least i can describe each one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a simple English explanation on the box:  \\&quot;Skincare regimen kit supplies collagen and moisture to improve complexion health and look\\&quot;.  Active ingredients: baobab tree extract and collagen.&lt;br /&gt;(my descriptions:  facial freshener -- not liquidy like water but clear, thickened watery gel;  emulsion -- also soft gel-like, opaque;  essence -- also gel-like half clear/opaque;  cream -- similar to essence except it is the \\&quot;thickest\\&quot; but still soft gel-like, not heavy, thick, or sticky.  All are the same scent but strongest lemony scent is the freshener.  All are similarly gel-like and goes on smoothly and absorbed by skin very easily and quickly and skin feels soft/refreshed.  This makes a great travel companion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am most happy that there are sample kits of Korean cosmetics we can try; Korean cosmetics are high quality products and you can see results quickly (like feeling soft skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to mention there was a small packet of SPF30 BB cream.  Was a bit light colored for my skin but spread on very well.</li>
    <li> These are sample size bottle, and they&#x27;re pretty small.  Plus the writing is in Korean so you can&#x27;t tell where to put the product on your face.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the actual product. I&#x27;m glad that I was able to buy this kit before buying a full sized product from thus line because I did not like and of these products. It wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me. I have oily/dry skin. It may work better if you have just oily or normal skin.</li>
    <li> Great product.. It does what it says  moisturizes without leaving you sticky.  I will be buying the full size products.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, small but it is good for people who are not sure about purchasing it and want to try it first. It is very soft with the skin and moisturizes well. My skin is super sensitive and oily and this product dos not irritates my skin and controls the oil and shine for long time. I have try many products and none were as good as this one. I totally must have!</li>
    <li> It is too small and the worst thing about it is that on the bottom of the box it says it is gift samples not for sale</li>
    <li> I use this after I wash my face because my skin feels super dry. I love this set and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of each product to feel the results.</li>
    <li> Great trial set. Let me try all the creams without purchasing the larger sizes.  Lasted long enough to get a good feel for the products. Love etude house products. Great for my super dry skin!!</li>
    <li> product was expired. The date said 2009. Never buying this product again. It made my face break out.</li>
    <li> came in weeks early and it great. the size is just great if traveling.</li>
    <li> came so early, in two days. I just put the cream on and it makes my skin feel so soft and fresh, I love it so far. but I wish it was so so small.</li>
    <li> Very small but then again they are samples. Everything feels sooo good on my skin and the fragrance is nice too. The package also arrived very fast.</li>
    <li> I thought they&#x27;re big, but they were just a trial pack.</li>
    <li> I like the way im able to test it out before i actually commits to buying the full size and i really like it.</li>
    <li> This is my most favorite line from Etude House EVER! The scent is pleasant, the products go on smoothly, and I LOVE how my skin feels even after the first use. My skin even breaks out less after using this, and makeup just glides on. If Etude House every stops making this product, I will be really upset.</li>
    <li> Seller was great. Not sure if I&#x27;ll use this product. No English instructions though.</li>
    <li> I give this a 5  out of 5 because I feel a difference in my skin after the first use. My skin is pretty sensitive so I found this to be very good. My skin is also quite dry, but after using this I feel hydrated and gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a product that can be used by everyone but I think people with dry sensitive skin would benefit even more.</li>
    <li> I must comment on the super fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I tried these samples on last night and by this morning my skin felt so nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Usually my skin is rather dry but this made my face look moisturized and it felt so soft too.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I could get all these products in the full size, not just sample sized.</li>
