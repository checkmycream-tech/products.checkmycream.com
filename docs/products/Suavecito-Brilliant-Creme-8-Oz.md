      <li>the good part.</li>
      <li>I would love to give Suavecito a 5 star review because I know this product would be great, if I could keep it on my head.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>As to the Brillantcreme, if you remember Top Brass you will want to try their Brillantcreme!  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic products!!  </li>
      <li>I would say it keeps hair fairly orderly the equivalent of a very light holding gel.</li>
      <li>On top of that it has a great smell and is very light in the hair.</li>
      <li>With all the glowing reviews here, I though I was going to be thrilled with Brilliantcreme.</li>
      <li>It also gave my hair a nice glow.</li>
      <li>It will make your hair nice and shiny, healthy looking.</li>
      <li>This product leaves a very smooth texture that is easy to comb and run your fingers through all day!</li>
      <li>This stuff is perfect for fine, normal hair.  </li>
      <li>Very light hold.  </li>
      <li>This hair product has a VERY light hold.</li>
      <li>Perfect for if you want a clean styled look with out high hold.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>TSA limits how many oz.</li>
      <li>If you need a bit more I&#x27;d move toward the pomade.</li>
      <li>hold the ladies love the smell</li>
      <li>This Brilliantcreme goes on light, provides a nice balance of hold and shine, and isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; so your hair doesn&#x27;t look encased in plastic.</li>
      <li>I like that I am able to run my fingers through my hair and feel like I have nothing in it.</li>
      <li>I found it helped keep more rigid water-based pomades more combable and pliable throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a more manly smell and the hair creme ended up smelling like medicine.</li>
      <li>It smelled great and felt pretty light.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re prominently featured in barber shops close to me, and for a good reason - their pomades and cremes are stellar performers.</li>
      <li>It smells very clean and manly.</li>
      <li>This product is pretty good in combination with another pomade.</li>
      <li>it back based on these issues, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s ideal for folks who don&#x27;t have my skin issues and don&#x27;t mind their pillowcase getting grimy if they go to bed with it still in their hair.</li>
      <li>Other than that Suavecito is excellent.  </li>
      <li>Strong chemical smell.  </li>
      <li>No I don&#x27;t work for or know anyone who does work for this fine company</li>
      <li>I went to a shop nearby and was amazed at how precise the stlist was.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells fricken manly and kicks ass as a pre pomade application or if you just wanna keep some light</li>
      <li>Works great when brushed through your hair.</li>
      <li>But just the right amount of sheen to represent healthy hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, fresh smelling, smooth, washes out easily and of a light to medium</li>
      <li>Has good hold without being stiff, nice clean look, smells good and not messy at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more every time I&#x27;m out thanks guy!</li>
      <li>Smelled great, and worked perfectly well, but two complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) oil-based formula made my skin break out BAD along my hairline.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell to it, similar to baby powder or something.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than Top brass or any other Brillantcreme ever made and at the age of 60, this old schooler has used a lot of this stuff over the years, Suavecito&#x27;s brand is better quality, longer lasting, washes out easily, smells great, and one application is all you need!</li>
      <li>Kind of like an old aftershave.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair so this product has nice enough of a hold to keep my hair in place all day.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly toi</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a loyal user of Suavecito Firme pomade.</li>
      <li>It completely lacks the barbicie / barber shop fragrance and washes out very easy.</li>
      <li>but if you put too much, which is easy to do, it&#x27;ll be kinda greasy/</li>
      <li>I regularly use Suavecito pomade, and I absolutely love the stuff!</li>
      <li>The first four days I progressively put more and more in my hair trying to get it to last all day.</li>
      <li>I have straight fine hair</li>
      <li>My barber used this, and I liked it enough that I bought a bottle to keep at home.  </li>
      <li>Package looks right.</li>
      <li>Great for shine but very little hold.</li>
      <li>For me, it works just the same as something like Murray&#x27;s, but at quite a bit more expense.</li>
      <li>The hold is light but leaves hair feeling natural.  </li>
      <li>It gives your hair a certain shininess.</li>
      <li>absolutely does NOT wash out with water.</li>
      <li>Looks like the real thing but is NOT.</li>
      <li>Not so much.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t see any real reason to buy this.</li>
      <li>Not as much hold as I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>It creates a nice shine that complements my firm pomade.  </li>
      <li>I seldom have to re-comb and what I also love is my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stiff like hair spray like Top Brass did, it feels soft and natural...</li>
      <li>It is better for longer hair for those who want a little hold.</li>
      <li>If you add it to wet hare it will separate thinner hair into bigger chunks and leave a wet matte look, if you use it on dry hair I find it leaves a light hold with a thicker looking comb back that looks good in my fine hair.</li>
      <li>If you have short hair or only need a little hold this is great.</li>
      <li>I bought this along with some other of the fine products from Suavecito</li>
      <li>finally tried combine both the Brilliantcreme and the Firme pomade and got an okay result- more long lasting and less helmet</li>
      <li>It keeps the Pomade from getting crunchy and brittle when it sets and leaves your hair very soft.</li>
      <li>Interestingly enough, the closest comp from my end is Brylcream, but the hold here is better, and it feels less greasy going on.</li>
      <li>When it gets a little longer I will primarily be using this.</li>
      <li>The real beauty of this stuff is you can put it in your hair early and then take your fingers later to &#x27;refresh&#x27; your look.  </li>
      <li>makes hair manageable and soft</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing to say the least.</li>
      <li>It also brings out your hairs natural bends and waves.</li>
      <li>By itself it&#x27;s OK, but it doesn&#x27;t work for my thick cowlicked hair as well as I thought it would by itself.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something that would not hold my hair so firm, last all day, and wash out fairly easy.</li>
      <li>but just stays combed in the style you set it in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, my old school and rockabilly brothers</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smelled great, and worked perfectly well, but two complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) oil-based formula made my skin break out BAD along my hairline. I realize that&#x27;s a personal body-chemistry issue, and not indicative of a universal problem with the product, but nonetheless... reason enough not to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) absolutely does NOT wash out with water. It&#x27;s not even water-soluble! 2nd ingredient is mineral oil. Case in point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent it back based on these issues, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s ideal for folks who don&#x27;t have my skin issues and don&#x27;t mind their pillowcase getting grimy if they go to bed with it still in their hair.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest hold but great to use before the pomade or if wearing a beanie</li>
    <li> A great product to soften up Suavecito pomade.</li>
    <li> holds well and does not leave a gressy residue.</li>
    <li> Works great when brushed through your hair. Does not leave your hair sticky and solid like other gel products!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells fricken manly and kicks ass as a pre pomade application or if you just wanna keep some light hold the ladies love the smell and so do I. If you add it to wet hare it will separate thinner hair into bigger chunks and leave a wet matte look, if you use it on dry hair I find it leaves a light hold with a thicker looking comb back that looks good in my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because I&#x27;m giving this product the benefit of the doubt. The second I got the product, I smelled it. The odor was enough to turn me off from the product. I tried putting it in once but couldn&#x27;t bear the smell (way worse than any other product I&#x27;ve used). I would love to give Suavecito a 5 star review because I know this product would be great, if I could keep it on my head.</li>
    <li> Holds great, smells great, not too shiny</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!! I&#x27;ll be purchasing more every time I&#x27;m out thanks guy!</li>
    <li> Like the product, hate the smell</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s lightweight, fresh smelling, smooth, washes out easily and of a light to medium shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s mostly not greasy but if you put too much, which is easy to do, it&#x27;ll be kinda greasy/oily looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just gotta find what amount works for your hair amd style. Other than that, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave this product four stars if for the smell. This product leaves a very smooth texture that is easy to comb and run your fingers through all day! It also brings out your hairs natural bends and waves. However this is NOT similar to a pomade or gel. It is closer to a wax product. It does not have the hardening or holding characteristics that they have. However this will give your hair a natural look, similar to if you were just on the beach all day and your hair stayed wavey. The white cream Liquid works smoothly into wet or dry hair and has an odd scent to it. Kind of like an old aftershave. My closest comparison to his cream is Axe wax+cream for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Not as much hold as I was hoping for. Good shine and pleasing scent though.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with some other of the fine products from Suavecito and I&#x27;m now a dedicated fan and customer of this great company and it&#x27;s fantastic products!!  As to the Brillantcreme, if you remember Top Brass you will want to try their Brillantcreme!  It&#x27;s better than Top brass or any other Brillantcreme ever made and at the age of 60, this old schooler has used a lot of this stuff over the years, Suavecito&#x27;s brand is better quality, longer lasting, washes out easily, smells great, and one application is all you need! Just wet your comb and re-comb any time during the day as you need to and it WILL stay in place!  I seldom have to re-comb and what I also love is my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stiff like hair spray like Top Brass did, it feels soft and natural...but just stays combed in the style you set it in at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, my old school and rockabilly brothers, you can not go wrong with this and all the other Suavecito products!  No I don&#x27;t work for or know anyone who does work for this fine company, I&#x27;m just a faithful customer of their great products.</li>
    <li> The product is very nice. It smells very clean and manly. The hold works very well for me because it isn&#x27;t stiff yet keeps my hair where I want it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Arrived quickly toi</li>
    <li> Was less expensive than the actual official website for brand and the product was authentic and works well for what i was needing it for</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect for fine, normal hair.  The hold is light but leaves hair feeling natural.  Not for Pomps but great for the wavy look.  I work in with hands and leave it.  Smell is REAL NICE.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a more manly smell and the hair creme ended up smelling like medicine. Awful! Putting the smell aside for a bit the creme actually worked and that is why I&#x27;m giving it two stars. For now I&#x27;m going back to the Crew Hair Creme.</li>
    <li> I must have gotten a bunk bottle or something...I&#x27;m a loyal user of Suavecito Firme pomade. I was looking for something that would not hold my hair so firm, last all day, and wash out fairly easy. With all the glowing reviews here, I though I was going to be thrilled with Brilliantcreme. Not so much. I used it over the course of a week, and I just don&#x27;t get what all the buzz is about. The first four days I progressively put more and more in my hair trying to get it to last all day. No luck. I sit at a desk all day and ride my bike about 8 miles a day. Nothing crazy here folks, and by dinner time, my hair is a mess again.&lt;br /&gt;I reached out to Suavecito directly to see if I had received a bad bottle or something and never heard back.&lt;br /&gt;I finally tried combine both the Brilliantcreme and the Firme pomade and got an okay result- more long lasting and less helmet hair- but I just can&#x27;t seem to get it quite right.&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I can&#x27;t recommend buying this. For me, it works just the same as something like Murray&#x27;s, but at quite a bit more expense. I just can&#x27;t see any real reason to buy this.</li>
    <li> Really great stuff.  I decided to try it based on the other reviews.  It helps add texture and holds your hair but doesn&#x27;t get stiff like a gel.  The real beauty of this stuff is you can put it in your hair early and then take your fingers later to &#x27;refresh&#x27; your look.  I have thinning hair that i&#x27;m losing and it works great on it.  The consistency is like a creme or lotion.  I just work it through with my fingers.  If you want a more slick look, use it on wet hair with a comb.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good in combination with another pomade. I found it helped keep more rigid water-based pomades more combable and pliable throughout the day. By itself it&#x27;s OK, but it doesn&#x27;t work for my thick cowlicked hair as well as I thought it would by itself.</li>
    <li> My barber used this, and I liked it enough that I bought a bottle to keep at home.  Use it daily.  I just use a tiny dab about the size of a pea; keeps my hair in place without looking greasy, being stiff or attracting bees.</li>
    <li> First off let me say I was hesitant to buy the stuff for the past year or so. I regularly use Suavecito pomade, and I absolutely love the stuff! Fingertips worth of pomade will hold my hair all day long with tons of shine and if I want a softer finish I can usually brush through the hair with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the good part. This brilliant cream has allowed me too keep my hair out of my face while maintaining a hold that looks like I just got out of the ocean or something. It has a pleasant smell to it, similar to baby powder or something. It&#x27;s refreshing to say the least. It will make your hair nice and shiny, healthy looking. Not overly shiny with a sleek gloss such as a pomade or something. But just the right amount of sheen to represent healthy hair. The reason I was so hesitant for the past year or so was because I thought, it&#x27;s just going to be another hair product that doesn&#x27;t have any hold and usually fades within a couple of hours. Not the case with this stuff! It lasts all day / all night and if you put a little water on your fingertips and run through your hair, you&#x27;re back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging that is came in was absolutely horrible! Somebody didn&#x27;t tighten down the pump bottle and it appears as if it had pumped itself several times in the plastic bag it came in. The product was all over the outside of the bottle and I feel some of it was lost during shipment. What&#x27;s that all about Amazon?</li>
    <li> What can I say about the Suavecito line that others haven&#x27;t said. They&#x27;re prominently featured in barber shops close to me, and for a good reason - their pomades and cremes are stellar performers. This Brilliantcreme goes on light, provides a nice balance of hold and shine, and isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; so your hair doesn&#x27;t look encased in plastic. Interestingly enough, the closest comp from my end is Brylcream, but the hold here is better, and it feels less greasy going on.</li>
    <li> Works great. Not going to give you a &amp;#34;hard as a brick&amp;#34; feel ala hair gel. Definately not going to give you pomade hold. But, if you need a light hold on your pompadour, or a little extra sheen for your slick, Suavecito Brilliantcreme is what you need!</li>
    <li> makes hair manageable and soft</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I would say it keeps hair fairly orderly the equivalent of a very light holding gel. This however doesn&#x27;t really dry it slightly stiffened because of the beeswax, but remained damp slick look all day. If you have short hair or only need a little hold this is great. If you need a bit more I&#x27;d move toward the pomade.</li>
    <li> I was visiting LA and needed a hair trim before a meeting. I went to a shop nearby and was amazed at how precise the stlist was. I have straight fine hair and i don&#x27;t use anything on my hair usually, due to the fact that gels and sprays are too stiff. Before I could say anything she put this cream onto my hair. It smelled great and felt pretty light. It also gave my hair a nice glow. I asked her about it and she wrote down the name (I couldn&#x27;t buy any there because I was flying home...TSA limits how many oz. you can take on board and I don&#x27;t check bags!) It kept my hair in place all day and never felt stiiff!&lt;br /&gt;When I got back East I immediately ordered some and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> This hair product has a VERY light hold. It gives your hair a certain shininess. It is better for longer hair for those who want a little hold. It is perfect for my transitioning haircut style. I&#x27;m progressing through the &amp;#34;undercut&amp;#34; and my hair will be growing all summer. When it gets a little longer I will primarily be using this.</li>
    <li> Looks like the real thing but is NOT. Package looks right. It completely lacks the barbicie / barber shop fragrance and washes out very easy. Might be bargain hand lotion....</li>
    <li> The product arrived late.  I don&#x27;t like late.  Other than that Suavecito is excellent.  It creates a nice shine that complements my firm pomade.  Get some!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair so this product has nice enough of a hold to keep my hair in place all day. On top of that it has a great smell and is very light in the hair. I like that I am able to run my fingers through my hair and feel like I have nothing in it. It also has a great amount of shine as well.</li>
    <li> Love all the Sauveciti products, but this stuff is the BEST! Has good hold without being stiff, nice clean look, smells good and not messy at all.</li>
    <li> Works great. Not greasy or sticky. Perfect for if you want a clean styled look with out high hold.&lt;br /&gt;Have used several other products and this is definitely one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Great for shine but very little hold. If that&#x27;s what your looking for then thus product is the one to get. I put it in my hair then apply Suavecito Regular Hold Pomade. It keeps the Pomade from getting crunchy and brittle when it sets and leaves your hair very soft. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Strong chemical smell.  Very light hold.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Holds well yet remains soft and pliable enough to comb all day long.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works great! Smells great too!</li>
