      <li>This is good stuff.</li>
      <li>very pleased.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It is a fairly nice scent but for the cost you would think you were up in the range of women&#x27;s finest perfumes.</li>
      <li>I love this on my husband and was able to find it on here at a really good price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice smell and scent to it, manly, not too strong and not too&lt;br /&gt;weak</li>
      <li>Very good, masculine scent that works well with my body chemistry.</li>
      <li>The Amazon prices are much better.</li>
      <li>Smells kind of cheap, as it is priced.  </li>
      <li>This is a favorite for me and for those around me.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
      <li>I am glad that I was able to get it for him as a gift</li>
      <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>but just about right, it smells better then aftershave and like</li>
      <li>The price was right!  </li>
      <li>It is not overpowering and has a sweet hint to it.</li>
      <li>I expect to go through this one quickly.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this Cologne,  smells great and last all day!</li>
      <li>As stated before, if you are the avid collector, buy it.  </li>
      <li>I not only love Tim McGraw&#x27;s music</li>
      <li>Will be back when it is time for me to get some more of this for myself.</li>
      <li>The Southern Blend (also Tim McGraw) is almost twice the size and has a more pleasing fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be back to get more when I run out.</li>
      <li>men&#x27;s cologne but a little more original in the scent</li>
      <li>I really like this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Bought it at Kohls (and paid too much) for $35.</li>
      <li>fast shipment.</li>
      <li>Merchandise was shipped fast and efficient.  </li>
      <li>has it cheap as well compared to other stores and online retailers</li>
      <li>There are better deals out there for comparable (if not better)</li>
      <li>It breathes masculine outdoors from the beginning, finishing with musky, oaky, and vetiver notes.  </li>
      <li>say if you&#x27;ve never tried this before to give it a try, while some&lt;br /&gt;guys might not like it, most guys (like me anyway) will or simply say&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s another average men&#x27;s cologne depending on the individual, their&lt;br /&gt;exp.</li>
      <li>this will last a least a month or more, even is used everyday,&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a sensitive issue, because as another reviewer pointed out, this is a tiny bottle.</li>
      <li>I received McGraw Silver as a present and pleasantly surprised at the fragrance...</li>
      <li>The Wow Factor has potential - Sweetie (a.k.a.</li>
      <li>With shipping less than $17 and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>At just under $18 for the small bottle (with free shipping), the deal is average.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! Wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price! I always look to Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband on his Birthday.  He loves it and some of his co-workers made good comments about it also.</li>
    <li> Smells great! My fiancé loves this scent. Shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> I was blown away by silver.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  The day I bought it, I wore it for a night out on the town with my wife to celebrate a friend&#x27;s 40th bday.  A woman came up to me at the party and asked what I was wearing and then brought some friends over to do a &#x27;sniff&#x27; test...and got all thumbs up!  And for the record, my wife loves it too and she is not into colognes.  This is a great scent!</li>
    <li> My husband smells delicious. I really like this fragrance. It is not overpowering and has a sweet hint to it.</li>
    <li> I have never seen a smaller bottle of men&#x27;s EDT.  It is a fairly nice scent but for the cost you would think you were up in the range of women&#x27;s finest perfumes. The Southern Blend (also Tim McGraw) is almost twice the size and has a more pleasing fragrance.  I thought this was a tester size when I opened it. I suppose the days of men&#x27;s fragrances actually looking like something a man might pick for himself have passed.  Still when its empty you can give it to your grandchildren for the doll house.</li>
    <li> I love this on my husband and was able to find it on here at a really good price. I am glad that I was able to get it for him as a gift</li>
    <li> Smells kind of cheap, as it is priced.  Good to just throw in your car but I wouldn&#x27;t wear everyday.</li>
    <li> Very good, masculine scent that works well with my body chemistry. Similar to Polo, though a little less overpowering. Bought it at Kohls (and paid too much) for $35. The Amazon prices are much better. This is a sensitive issue, because as another reviewer pointed out, this is a tiny bottle. I had a 4oz. bottle of Polo that seems to have lasted for years. I expect to go through this one quickly.</li>
    <li> Received both McGraw silver and gold for Christmas from my wife. Wear them both but I prefer the Silver. Always would put on Aspen and still like it. But at $24 a bottle? Bought mine at make-up planet. With shipping less than $17 and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these as Christmas gifts.  You cannot beat this price.  Paid almost this amount for an half ounce &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; with no packaging elsewhere.  Merchandise was shipped fast and efficient.  Will be back when it is time for me to get some more of this for myself.</li>
    <li> Received product on time, and just as described.</li>
    <li> fast shipment. no problems at all . very pleased. I would highly recommend this Cologne,  smells great and last all day!</li>
    <li> I received McGraw Silver as a present and pleasantly surprised at the fragrance... It breathes masculine outdoors from the beginning, finishing with musky, oaky, and vetiver notes.  When you smell it, you definitely think you are in the country.  Good scent - I&#x27;m impressed.  The Wow Factor has potential - Sweetie (a.k.a. my girlfriend) complimented the fragrance following the initial application. Those are the good points...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the downside.  Silver is on the weaker side of longevity and the smaller bottle (one ounce) is awkwardly small in your hand - difficult to hold and spray.  At just under $18 for the small bottle (with free shipping), the deal is average.  If I were buying, I would probably want a lower price for the small bottle. There are better deals out there for comparable (if not better) fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the uniqueness of the fragrance and if you like (country) Southern style scents, add Silver to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I give Silver 4 stars out of 5.  As stated before, if you are the avid collector, buy it.  The eyes are the windows to the soul...</li>
    <li> After I realized the Tim McGraw &amp;#34;Silver&amp;#34; was cologne and not a CD, I looked online.  The price was right!  It was a great stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> It was as expected! My brother loved it!</li>
    <li> This is a favorite for me and for those around me. This is good stuff. I&#x27;ll be back to get more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I not only love Tim McGraw&#x27;s music (yeah I know I&#x27;m a guy lol) but also his brand&lt;br /&gt;of cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell and scent to it, manly, not too strong and not too&lt;br /&gt;weak but just about right, it smells better then aftershave and like&lt;br /&gt;regular men&#x27;s cologne but a little more original in the scent dept.&lt;br /&gt;and this will last a least a month or more, even is used everyday,&lt;br /&gt;as long as only 1-3 sprays/applications are done in a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like both the Silver brand of cologne here and the regular one as&lt;br /&gt;well, I pick them up in CVS or Wal Mart when they are usually on sale&lt;br /&gt;during the Holidays or sometimes at random for around $10 and Amazon&lt;br /&gt;here has it cheap as well compared to other stores and online retailers&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen when they have it in stock for above average retail prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say if you&#x27;ve never tried this before to give it a try, while some&lt;br /&gt;guys might not like it, most guys (like me anyway) will or simply say&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s another average men&#x27;s cologne depending on the individual, their&lt;br /&gt;exp. using men&#x27;s cologne and other factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for my boyfriend for years and it smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend.  He smells so good!</li>
