      <li>Let me start out by saying this is a great aftershave.</li>

      <li>Smells great right out of the bottle though.</li>
      <li>The original Bay Rum scent is a perfectly balanced Bay Rum that doesn&#x27;t have too much clove.</li>
      <li>Though it makes a great warm weather aftershave with its wonderful citrus scent, it is easily an aftershave you can enjoy year round.  </li>
      <li>If you like the spicy smell that is inherent in the bay rum aftershaves you will love this version with the infused lime scent.</li>
      <li>It is a bit on the pricey side for an aftershave, but if you love the lime scent, nothing I have found can compare to this.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Let me start off by writing that it is impossible to pour out too much of this after shave. So the container gets 5 stars. But the after shave itself gets 2 stars. I cannot remotely smell anything resembling LIME in this product. It is heavy with witch hazel and glycerin. I would prefer more alcohol. I have no idea what &amp;#34;essential oil and extracts&amp;#34; might be. All-in-all, a disappointment.  Where&#x27;s the LIME?</li>
    <li> I love Captain&#x27;s Choice.  Since I discovered these aftershaves a few months ago, I have acquired all three varieties ([[ASIN:B0066GR55K Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum Aftershave 4oz after shave]], [[ASIN:B00A0J4RS2 Cat o&#x60; Nine Tails Bay Rum Aftershave 4oz after shave by Captain&#x27;s Choice]], and Lime), and have pretty much stopped using any other aftershave.  Why? Let me count the ways I love the Lime...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE SMELL.  I look forward to splashing this on every morning.  The smell is sweet, tangy, uplifting...just fantastic.  A bit of aromatherapy in the morning.  On warm days, this is just about perfect.  In fact, my only complaint about the Lime is that the scent fades more quickly than Captain&#x27;s Choice&#x27;s other offerings. As I understand it this is just a function of the natural essential oils of the lime, which brings me to my next point...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE INGREDIENTS.  I prefer to use all-natural products when I can, and my wife is an absolute stickler for such things. Many aftershaves are alcohol + \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; or \\&quot;parfum\\&quot; (which can include any number of undisclosed chemicals, some of which may be toxic). Captain&#x27;s Choice Lime is made of Alcohol, Witch Hazel, Essential Oils and Extracts, and Glycerin.  That&#x27;s it.  Awesome.  And those non-alcohol ingredients?  They&#x27;re the reason . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE WAY IT FEELS.  This is where Lime (and all the Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershaves) really hits it out of the park.  I&#x27;ve yet to find any other aftershave that feels as good going on, or makes my skin feel as supple and refreshed as Captain&#x27;s Choice.  Many aftershaves will dry out your skin, or can leave it feeling a bit sticky.  Captain&#x27;s Choice always goes on smooth, and feels great all day. Even if it didn&#x27;t smell at all, I would use this after every shave.  The fact that it smells fantastic makes it a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are you still reading this?  BUY IT NOW!!!!  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a tremendous fan of Captain&#x27;s Choice bay rum since it hit the market. I find it head and shoulders above every other bay rum out there. So, when news of a new lime AS leaked out, I had very high hopes. The Captain did not disappoint! A fresh lime scent initially, it dries down to a very pleasant wood/spice/lime that stays just barely there for a fairly long time (compared to most lime AS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new lime feels as soothing to my face post-shave as the bay rum, thanks to a touch of glycerin in the mix. A fairly mild alcohol burn at first (less than the bay rum) that dissipates quickly and leaves my face feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain&#x27;s Choice Lime may well be the perfect summer aftershave. It&#x27;ll definitely be a staple in my medicine cabinet. (Doesn&#x27;t hurt that my wife looooves the scent, either.)</li>
    <li> Captain&#x27;s Choice has done it again.  Having one of the best bay rum scents on the market, this artisan company has done something many have tried and failed to do: they created a unique lime scent that lasts.  It&#x27;s a deep plunge into lime, hinting at it&#x27;s sweetness, but also hinting at \\&quot;something else\\&quot; in the blend.  Maybe a slight woody/spicy note in there.  Hard to tell, but its a wonderful take on lime.  This aftershave provides a gentle alcohol burn to help numb off any spots where you were too aggressive with your razor, witch hazel to help your skin heal, and glycerin to moisturize.  All in all its a simple yet complex product, with a great spring/summer scent.  I&#x27;ve got a lot of aftershaves in my shave den, but I&#x27;ve been reaching for this one almost every day since it arrived.</li>
    <li> This is a nice aftershave.  It does effectively condition the skin after shaving.  It has a pleasant smell, which quickly becomes very subtle, but lingers with you for a while.  It may just be my \\&quot;nose\\&quot;, but to me, the scent is too sweet for limes.  It reminds me of citronella candles, actually.  Not a bad smell, just not as sharp/crisp as the scent of lime, and not what I had hoped for (very subjective opinion), so I personally will not be purchasing this again.  On the positive side, I have not been bothered with mosquitos since I&#x27;ve been using this. (ha ha)</li>
    <li> Captains Choice Lime is a definite winner! Awesome spring and summer scent that makes you feel like you are on an Island somewhere. I decided to give CC Lime a chance after trying the other scents from the Captain which were all great so I figured it was a no brainer. Man was I right. My wife loves how it smells on me and unlike most other brands it does not fade after you initially put it on. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Captains Choice Lime!</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected - I can&#x27;t smell the lime in it hardly at all.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Definitely a more lime oil (from lime skin/rind) type scent.  Based on some other reviews I think some people were expecting a more fresh, lime-juice smell.  But I really like it, and it feels great on my face.  Moisturizing without being greasy.  The only real negatives to me are the price, and the scent only lasts a few minutes (unless your face gets wet/sweats, then you catch a whiff of it again)</li>
    <li> Not enough of a lime smell. More witch hazel smell to it</li>
    <li> Best lime aftershave on the market.  Period.  Buy Pinaud Lime Sec if you want to smell like a green lollipop.  Buy this if you want to revel in the smell of freshly squeezed lime.  Great face feel.  Scent fades within the hour.</li>
    <li> The Captain&#x27;s Choice Lime delivers an incredibly smooth feeling after a good shave. The lime scent is very refreshing and it is nice and crisp on application. I am very impressed with how well it conditions my skin.</li>
    <li> Thought the bottle was a bit expensive for the size, but it&#x27;s quite a bit larger. The scent isn&#x27;t overly sweet and wish it would last a bit longer but would buy again.</li>
    <li> Long lasting scent and soothing witch hazel to reduce irritation. I could not be more pleased and half the cost of competitors equivalent.</li>
    <li> Great lime scent but don&#x27;t forget to shake it vigorously before you use it. The lime separates for the bay rum.</li>
    <li> I finally found an after shave that felt good on my face and has a scent that is perfect! This is this Captain&#x27;s choice-</li>
    <li> Not worth the price. Don&#x27;t get the scent expected for the price paid. Can get better product for much less.</li>
    <li> My go to aftershave! Nice clean smell of limes and other spices, with that said...it&#x27;s a faint smell, not over powering like an old lady&#x27;s perfume in church.  This makes you smell good not an entire room.</li>
    <li> Yummy smelling and soothing on my freshly shaven face. No burn unless I made a mistake. Excellent, excellent, aftershave. My favorite by far. Fresh lime scent with a hint of bay leaf lasts about an hour or so. I love it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a good aftershave if you prefer the lime scent. Otherwise it is good but not overly pleasing. Again, if you enjoy lime then by all means go with this one - you&#x27;ll really love it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite aftershave.  I love the light, pleasant lime scent and the perfect tingly feeling after a shave.  My problem was with the way it was shipped.  Though it was shipped in a zip lock baggie, the lid wasn&#x27;t taped and it became unloosened during shipping resulting in a lot of the product unnecessarily wasted.  I will look for a different vendor when I&#x27;m ready for another bottle.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful, a sweet lime scent that is delightfully citrusy.  The dispenser is similar to other oils, with the only inconvenience being the screw on top.  I suppose I could just put the bottle down and apply the aftershave before trying to screw the cap back on, but I&#x27;m a creature of habit.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after seeing some positive reviews on Badger &amp; Blade. Have used it twice and I am not impressed with the smell. It is nice a scent, mild but I was expecting something amazing from all the people using it and raving about it. The scent does not last long enough for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand. This is called Lime aftershave and honestly even though I try my best and have a good sniffer, I can smell no lime in this product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this aftershave does not have a lime scent.  It smells like wet wood.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It doesn&#x27;t have much staying power though. I like to mix a little bit of the CC Lime with some Ogallala Bay Rum. Perfection!</li>
    <li> Feels good and smells even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This aftershave does a fantastic job of conditioning and bracing my skin.  So much so that I even splash it mosquito bites for the soothing coolness of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is as advertised, a potent but natural-smelling lime scent.  My only criticism is that the scent is brief and dries down to pretty much nothing.  That&#x27;s more the nature of lime, though; it doesn&#x27;t hang around long.  While it lasts, though, it&#x27;s intoxicating.</li>
    <li> This aftershave is great the only thing I do not like is the scent fades in about 15 minutes. It smells like a fresh lime with a bit of spice to it. It has a mild sting when applied. It smells really strong in the bottle but when you put it on it has a very weak scent. This is by no means a cologne just a true aftershave. Great product but I gave it 4 stars because of its higher price. I really like it but the price of this aftershave overshadows the quality for me.</li>
    <li> This is is an alcohol based aftershave so be prepared to feel a bit of a sting if you&#x27;ve nicked yourself, that said it wasn&#x27;t so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t use it again and was definitely milder than cheaper aftershaves that are loaded with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is spicy with notes of lime in the background so if you want an aftershave that smells like lime jello this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the aftershave itself is quite good and it left my face feeling fresh and clean after my shave (even hours later my face still feels fresh and clean without the smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell lingered for about 30 minutes which again is pretty strong for an aftershave (it&#x27;s not a cologne so it shouldn&#x27;t be super strong), especially one that contains citrus essential oils.  Citrus oils always need an anchor to hold them which I suspect is why there is so much spice in this aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thin liquid aftershave and you don&#x27;t need much of it to satisfy your face.  It should last a long while unless you glob it on your face or you&#x27;re drinking it because you&#x27;re cheap and you ran out of beer or mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good mid range aftershave this is a solid choice.</li>
    <li> Oddish smell, doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the good lime scent.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased all 3 Captain&#x27;s Choice scents. They are all unique and each offers something special. The original Bay Rum scent is a perfectly balanced Bay Rum that doesn&#x27;t have too much clove. The Cat O&#x27; Nine Tails kicks it up a notch by adding some warmth. And then there is the Lime... oh yeah the Lime. Some things just go better with lime, such as a 7&amp;7, and a Cuba Libre (Rum, Coke and Lime).  The combination of clove and lime provides a wonderful scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. In fact, tonight I was at my local pub and the gal sitting next to me complimented my \\&quot;cologne.\\&quot; It&#x27;s not cologne, but aftershave that has alcohol, and does not dry my skin.  The citrus, clove, and spices are the perfect blend for a unique aftershave.  It&#x27;s great for warm weather and won&#x27;t leave your skin dry.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My summertime favorite. Love it</li>
    <li> Not quite what I was looking for. Not a true lime scent and no staying power. Bottle came with cap loose and a third leaked out.</li>
    <li> Absolutely as described and more! Everyone who&#x27;s on the fence try this now! You will not be disappointed at all!</li>
    <li> I had a prior bottle of this and really liked it, quickly jumped to the top of my list. My latest purchase seems to be lacking in the scent department and feels heavier on the alcohol side of things. Hopefully it&#x27;s just this bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells OK, not like any lime I have ever smelled but not offensive.</li>
    <li> Outstanding bay rum and lime. Will order again.</li>
    <li> A nice aftershave but it doesn&#x27;t have the lime scent I was hoping for.  To me, the witch hazel overpowers the lime.</li>
    <li> love the after shave.  Only issue is that its pricey.</li>
    <li> For an aftershave, this and the same manufacture&#x27;s Bay Rum are my two favorites.  This contains all the right ingredients, including witch hazel.  If you get razor burn or bumps, this helps immensely.  It is a bit on the pricey side for an aftershave, but if you love the lime scent, nothing I have found can compare to this.  There is a bit of bite to it, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.  The website for the company does offer samples, so if you don&#x27;t want to take the plunge on the seventeen bucks, search for the company website and you can order a sample of all their aftershaves.  Amazon does have the best prices if you are a prime member.</li>
    <li> Lime scent somewhat over powering.</li>
    <li> Not for me... More bay leaf scent than lime.</li>
    <li> As far as Aftershave is concerned, you would be hard pressed to do better that that chosen by the Captain.  Simple ingredients, works like a charm, and smells wonderful.  The lime scent improves my outlook every morning that I splash it on.  A seriously good product.</li>
    <li> A nice lasting scent that&#x27;s not too sweet. Actually smells like lime and not perfume.</li>
    <li> Scent was not what I expected for a Lime Aftershave, scent was not a lime fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells great for about 5 minutes then dies.  I don&#x27;t want something that fills every room that I walk into,  quite the contrary, but there is not even a residual scent within minutes of applying it.  Smells great right out of the bottle though.</li>
    <li> Love the lime scent mixed with that bay smell just a great aftershave. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I really like this Lime aftershave, and I never had an issue smelling Lime in it like some of the other reviewers. I don&#x27;t find it synthetic smelling at all. It also makes my skin feel good. The scent to me is 5 stars, but it disappears so fast, therefore it falls somewhere between 3 and 4 stars for me. I&#x27;ve tried other lime scented aftershaves/colognes through the years(OldSpice Lime, Royall Lime, Clubman Lime, Proraso Green), and they all smell cheap and synthetic compared to the Captain. If your looking for a quick shot of Lime, this is a nice aftershave. Just don&#x27;t buy this and expect the scent to linger. It&#x27;s gone in minutes. If the scent lasted, I&#x27;d rate this 5 stars. I love it. It just might be my favorite Captain&#x27;s Choice variation of aftershave.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good splash aftershave for wet shaving.  The captain comes through.  Smells fantastic, little sting, and leaves your face feeling fresh.  I originally got samples of this and the other Captains offerings, but the Lime was something special!</li>
    <li> This is an after shave that would appeal to men of all ages. If your looking to buy an after shave for someone this is it. A classic and timeless scent that will never go out of style. Reminds me of my father&#x27;s lime after shave from the 1970&#x27;s only better.</li>
    <li> This product has a decent smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long; maybe five minutes if you&#x27;re lucky. Another feature of this aftershave is that there is absolutely NO burn. This could be both a pro and a con, for me it&#x27;s a con. If you&#x27;re interested in a mild, short lived aftershave, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I use several aftershaves in rotation, and I must say, the skin care and post-shave feel this product offers is unparalleled.  Though it makes a great warm weather aftershave with its wonderful citrus scent, it is easily an aftershave you can enjoy year round.  The lime scent is pure lime and very natural.  There is nothing sweet or cloying about the scent at all.  For me, the most important aspect of an aftershave is how the AS cares for my skin.  Though I am prone to have dry skin, this is one of the few alcohol containing aftershaves I have used that actually moisturizes my skin and does it very well.  Overall, it is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Love this new offering from the Captain.  It has a fresh, clean lime scent that fades into a spicy background.  It reminds me of being in a citrus grove, both sweet and tangy.  It leaves the face dry, not oily.  It goes on light, and leaves the skin taunt and dry.  A must have for any Bay Rum rotation.  All A&#x27;s Captain, keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> I liked the smell and it wasn&#x27;t super overpowering.</li>
    <li> It really is the Captain&#x27;s choice, and I should know.</li>
    <li> I tried this as a sample and loved it. It&#x27;s cool and doesn&#x27;t sting at all. Feels great. I will buy more!</li>
    <li> Captain&#x27;s Choice Lime Aftershave is great for summer. The scent is mainly limes but also has subtle woody and spice notes that help the scent last longer and give it complexity. The face-feel of this aftershave is about the same as the Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum, however the sting is a slightly more mild.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews for this product I was excited… but for me it has no lime fragrance, no fragrance at all. I have purchased 3 or 4 different Lime Aftershaves lately to match my lime have cream, no luck. I would not buy this Lime Aftershave from Captain&#x27;s Choice again.</li>
    <li> I like this product &amp; at the low Amazon price, I was willing to buy it untried. It&#x27;s got a nice,  clean fragrance, not too strong or overbearing, and is serving me well on my tropical winter holiday in the Caribbean.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> This is my personal pick from the Captain&#x27; Choice lineup. Having read a lot of good things about this company online, I did myself a favor and ordered the sampler pack from them, and all 5 of their products made my face feel great (even the Cat O Nine Tails after the burn subsided). Like most of the Captain&#x27;s Choice products, there is also very little burn. The thing that sets the Lime above the other versions for me is the smell. This is a mild Bay Rum with a strong lime note, and this really works for me. Regular Bay Rum isn&#x27;t quite my thing personally, I&#x27;ve found it to be a bit too foodlike and maybe a bit too musky. But paired with the clean scent of lime, its great. The lime sharpens, cleans up, and tones down the Bay Rum aspect of the scent, while the Bay Rum adds depth and complexity while also making the scent last longer. There is no question of the 5 different varieties of Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershave, this is definitely the one I&#x27;d order again. Which smell you&#x27;ll prefer will be something of personal decision. This is obviously less likely to appeal to a real Bay Rum fan (for example if you already like Pinaud&#x27;s Bay Rum, you&#x27;d probably much prefer the Cat O Nine Tails version to this). But this is my preference, and what I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who wants a Lime-Bay Rum combo. Also, if you&#x27;re looking for just lime, look elsewhere, though personally I&#x27;ve never encountered a lime-only scent that had much staying power.</li>
    <li> I have read in many places that after shaves with alcohol is bad.  I suppose that would be true if all that was in the bottle was alcohol, water, and smelly stuff.  The fact that the ingredients are few and readable is a plus.  My face feels great after application.  The burn is mild even after cutting myself with a straight razor.  I love the smell and I also love how my face feels all day.  This is a very good after shave and I wish this was also a cologne.</li>
    <li> High quality stuff. My favorite aftershave now. A TINY bit too expensive for me. I&#x27;d pay $15 for this. Not $18. But that said, I still plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> My new favorite aftershave!  It definitely stings when it goes on but seems to help stop any bleeding from razor nicks.  The smell is extremely pleasant but isn&#x27;t overpowering.  It lingers for a few hours and gets faint after about 3.5 hours.  I wish the smell would last longer but otherwise it&#x27;s a great aftershave.</li>
    <li> This is a good aftershave, would be 5 stars, but the scent only lasts for seconds.  Still leaves a great feeling though.  Does burn some.</li>
    <li> This lands a 3 on the rating scale.  Reason:  It&#x27;s good but not very.  The scent is pleasant and a post shave splash satisfies but the experience is forgotten and fades into history literally 8 seconds later.  No lingering scent, no tingle or burn...  It&#x27;s good to add some variety to your after shaves but I could get the same results by smashing a lime wedge on my face and it would be more cost effective.  Take it or leave it.</li>
    <li> Another winner in the Captains Choice range of fantastic aftershaves....This aftershave has a wonderful, crisp, dry Lime scent with a bit of spice in the background. It is loaded with skin friendly goodies that will make your face feel refreshed, healed and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I prefer this scent than the \\&quot;Lime Sec\\&quot; from Clubman. The scent is not candy-sweet, but smells nice and refreshing,&lt;br /&gt;like picking a fresh lime off a tree in Florida and slicing into it. The scent itself doesn&#x27;t linger too long;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however if you don&#x27;t wear a cologne and a bead of sweat hits, it refreshes the scent which is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The healing properties are right in line with the Bay rum&#x27;s and cat o&#x27; nine tails, which is above quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like it, I still lean towards the scent of Bay Rum/Cat O&#x27; Nine Tails; however just as I like the aroma&lt;br /&gt;better. Having it for a random summer day would be quite of a nice change.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic aftershave. If you like the spicy smell that is inherent in the bay rum aftershaves you will love this version with the infused lime scent. It is a nice summer take on the traditional scent. I gave it four stars as the only drawback is the scent does not last that long,</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying this is a great aftershave. It has just the right burn, leaves my skin refreshed even after a 3 pass shave, and smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is it not is any resemblance of a lime aftershave, which is exactly what I ordered and exactly what the label says it is supposed to be. I&#x27;m not sure what happened, it is strong in cloves so I think the bottle may have been mislabeled, but there is no hint of lime in the product I received and its severely disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is frustrating because as an avid wet shaver I really wanted to support this company. If you want a good aftershave this seems to be a quality brand. If you want a company that advertises its products correctly look elsewhere. Hopefully I will receive some type of customer support, we shall see.</li>
    <li> delivered early,happy</li>
    <li> nice fragrance but not as much lime as I would have expected.  refreshing aftershave that my son always comments on.</li>
    <li> As advertised and Herself likes the scent.</li>
    <li> Captain&#x27;s Choice Aftershaves are what a quality aftershave is all about. Manly scents, quality ingredients (including witch hazel) &amp; reasonable pricing. You say $18 isn&#x27;t reasonable? Go check out what they get for some of them Boy Band/Designer fragrances. Like this but prefer the Bay Rum. Like The Beatles, some things are classics forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not totally happy with this and won&#x27;t be buying it again. I don&#x27;t smell much lime... Like others have said it&#x27;s got a weird bay rum or clove thing going. It&#x27;s not very citrusy or refreshing. I&#x27;m kinda bummed out with this purchase.</li>
    <li> An excellent product. Just the right amount of alcohol. And it has other nice ingredients that actually make this a nice \\&quot;skin refresher\\&quot; splash to use anytime, whether you just shaved or not! The scent is really fresh and eye opening. A perfect \\&quot;lime zest\\&quot; scent with some nice underlying bright non-lime citrus and warming spice from the alcohol. Lime scents can be notorious for quickly fading, but this scent hangs on longer than most. A winner!</li>
    <li> When Captain&#x27;s Choice ventured outside of their signature brand Bay Rum, I wondered...but the results are wonderful.  This is not \\&quot;janitor in a drum-Lime\\&quot;, but refreshing and all-natural Lime, and the scent is intense like no other.  Once again, I am \\&quot;hooked\\&quot; by the Captain!</li>
    <li> A very good after shave with plenty of lime aroma.  The best I&#x27;ve found since Royall Lime ceased being manufactured in Bermuda.  However, it&#x27;s hard to forget the original Royall Lime, which was a one of a kind product.  Captain&#x27;s Choice Lime is a good replacement.</li>
    <li> This aftershave has really grown on me. I&#x27;ve been using it almost exclusively this summer. It makes for a great warm weather fragrance. It smells good enough I&#x27;m halfway tempted to drink it. The scent doesn&#x27;t hang around very long,  though.  It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin, with little to no drying, and not much burn, though it does contain alcohol and glycerine.</li>
    <li> Sure don&#x27;t smell like lime,but makes your face feel good.My wife don&#x27;t like the smell either.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant, light scent. Good value for the money. A quality product.</li>
    <li> so sonot worth the $$$$</li>
    <li> This is the latest scent in the Captain&#x27;s Choice line of aftershaves.  Each one is excellent in its ability to revive the skin after shaving.  If you have ever experienced razor burn, or any kind of discomfort from shaving, this is practically an instant and lasting cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus to this line of aftershaves is the lack of harmful chemicals. A five-year-old would have no problem pronouncing any of the ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to say about the scent?  It is a highly invigorating and refreshing explosion of fresh lime - great for a hot summer day or any other time for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product highly enough.  Get the lime scent and I&#x27;ll bet you will be investing in the original Bay Rum and painfully addictive Cat of Nail Tails in no time flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last consideration, do not let the price throw you off.  These aftershaves are very concentrated and a little goes a long way.  After purchasing my first bottle, I used it every day until it ran out - I had that bottle for a solid four months!</li>
