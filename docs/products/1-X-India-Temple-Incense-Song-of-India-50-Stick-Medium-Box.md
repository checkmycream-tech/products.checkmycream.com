<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The scent is simply divine! The aroma lingers for several hours after burning. Great product for my meditation time. Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> this is my favorite, and i get it whenever i can. i love how much comes in the box, and it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> Love this subtle incense!  I usually buy sandalwood, patchouli, jasmine or other musky, woody scents but this temple incense is possibly the nicest scent I&#x27;ve come across.  Don&#x27;t want to try to describe it because it is so different - not overly flowery, not strong but gentle and calming.  People coming into my home after I&#x27;ve used it have commented on how nice it smells and how light the fragrance.  I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this given a few bad reviews but fail to see any faults. It has a distinctly different fragrance and can be overpowering in smaller spaces. Overall I find it pleasant.    I have not noticed a \\&quot;burning plastic\\&quot; smell as mentioned in other reviews.</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling incense and it says right on the box \\&quot;when you enter a room - Its like heaven\\&quot;. Before you use it make sure you like the smell though because it lingers more so than any other incents I have tried.</li>
    <li> Smells just like I remember. Better than nag champa - nice and sweet, not overwhelming, but not underwhelming either.</li>
    <li> Very nice incensy smell. Hard to describe but leaves a very pleasant aroma around the house.</li>
    <li> I love this scent because it smells sweet and aweosome. I mix this scent with lavender from HEM. As a massage therapist I have a bit of this going and the room smells relaxing and awesome</li>
    <li> This is the most fragrant incense I have ever purchased - which to me is a good thing. I have the box stored on a shelf in the living, and can smell them from halfway across the room. No need to even light them! (I still do, especially if my cat has just done her business.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some people, the scent may be a bit overwhelming, but I find it to be perfect. It&#x27;s not too &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; for me.</li>
    <li> I love all Indian aromas.  The smell lingered in the house even after the incense went out.  I highly recommend this incense.</li>
    <li> Not in a bad sense- just very strong even in the shipping box you could smell it. It was a gift.</li>
    <li> They smell great, reminds me of my childhood at the temple.</li>
    <li> ISH. These sticks are EXTREMELY strong! I had to get them out of my immediately! I&#x27;m sorry to put them as only one star, but this is an honest review and I really couldn&#x27;t take the smell. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Great smell and lasted for a long time. This was a new incense for me but it worked out great. will be getting more in the future.</li>
    <li> The scent of these incense is fantastic! The aroma flows through the house with just one stick burning. I love these and the scent lingers after the stick has burned.</li>
    <li> Nice price for amount shipped. Smells great and it takes only one to do the job of relaxing your house.</li>
    <li> The smell is overbearing. It pretty much smells like soap, but soap you spilled all over your house and can&#x27;t get out.</li>
    <li> Subject says it all. These are great and I plan to buy more with my next purchase while I still know how to find them. It is a slightly milder and cleaner aroma than a lot of Indian incense but it fills a few adjoining rooms without being overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;Had a party and some people smoking cigarettes in my house (I am a non-smoker). I can&#x27;t air the place out as it will be below zero here tomorrow. Washing the furniture covers &amp; burning a couple of these made it all good. :-)</li>
    <li> Purchased as a housewarming gift for a co-worker and husband (they are from India) to go along with Incense Burner Decorative Hand Carved Wooden Coffin Stick Cone Holder with Storage Compartment and Floral Brass Inlay. It was well received.</li>
    <li> To me, it smells very much like ordinary patchouli, only a bit smokier and the sticks don&#x27;t burn as long.&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, I like patchouli just fine, I guess I was just expecting something more...</li>
    <li> I got this along with the Wooden Coffin Incense Burner- Is it possible there is a better scent in the world?  I don&#x27;t think so.  Peace.  Joy.  Happiness.  Serenity.  This scent helps create these.</li>
    <li> this will definitely be a part of my incense collection. i usually used the super hit but this is a lighter fragrance but equally as strong. it is a floral scent but it doesn&#x27;t overpower as i read in some other reviews. the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that the sticks burn a lot quicker than the nag champa ones i&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> Most everyone loved these, but I read a few that were hesitant, so I went with the smaller box.  Big mistake - SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE BIGGER BOX.  These smell amazing, and leave my rooms smelling amazing well after it&#x27;s done burning... if you are thinking about buying these DO IT (and get the bigger box!)</li>
    <li> Based on other reviews, I had high expectations for this product, but it has the overpowering smell of old lady perfume to me. It&#x27;s the strongest incense I&#x27;ve ever used, but I just can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent odor characterisitics, extremely strong.  Not your average department store incense.  Sticks burn approximately 35-40 minutes, but one is all you need to enjoy over even the most rank of odors (if need be).  Very soothing.  Very, very strong!</li>
    <li> This is very strong, very fragrant incense with powerful floral notes.  Burning 1/4 of a stick is enough to sweeten an entire room.  It&#x27;s THAT effective and smells like no other incense I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  The first time I experienced it, I was sold!  I buy it regularly now (for over 10 years) because I love the energy and the scent it brings to my space.  Additionally, you can leave the package OUT in the open (in a drawer or in a pencil cup) for all-day gentle sweetening.  It&#x27;s wonderful and works well in conjunction with smudging wands/sticks.</li>
    <li> HAVEN&#x27;T BURNED YET, USING IN MY AUTO AS IT SAYS IN DIRECTIONS FOR A MONTH.  I  NEEDED A TIRE REPLACED AND HAD AN AUTO MECHANIC RAVE ABOUT HOW WONDERFUL THE INSIDE OF MY AUTO SMELLED.</li>
    <li> I Love my Incense....and I&#x27;ve tried alot of different kinds.this i have found to be in the top 5 of the best incense out today.Trust me if you like incnse like i do.then this is great..Give it a try...it lasts along time...the odor is truely of an India Monestary or shrine..Fantastic.This is the fourth 50 pack i have bought and certainly will buy more.</li>
    <li> This is fragrant, pleasing to the senses.  I&#x27;ve had other incense sticks pop when lit and burn up quite fast, this has a nice even flow.  The essence is what makes this incense.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Great Item.. Love the scent</li>
    <li> This is a fresh scent both sweet and spicy , perfect blend , and I for one have missed burning this high quality incense , It does not choke me up , has no heavy smoke residue in the air, will for sure buy this again in bulk..I could burn this all day long..Everyday..It came with tape over the clip for extra protection in a yellow mailer, fast delivery..will buy again...~!~</li>
    <li> As another reviewer said, it smells very much like strong old lady perfume. Overall I simply couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. As someone who enjoys Jasmine incense and was looking to replace an incense someone gave me, I won&#x27;t be buying this again. I may however, try another from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Very slow burning, lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;+ Scent is strong, enough to fill your household&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Scent is unpleasant</li>
    <li> these have a nice sent....BUT they are very strong! Example I placed the closed box on top of my mantle next to the burner. My wife comes home and is in the next room (open floor plan) and makes the comment that the incense I&#x27;m burning is really strong. I then tell her I do not have them lit and that they are still in the box. And then my wife replied to me those are really strong if I can smell them and they are not even lit. So when it comes to these I store them in whats called a &amp;#34;SMELLY PROOF&amp;#34; bag I they are used for herbs you don&#x27;t want people to smell. I hope this helped.</li>
    <li> I love these, and find myself constantly buying them before having an oppurtunity to run out.  These along with the frankinsence sticks are great, not overpowering, and long lasting.</li>
    <li> OMG. I cannot get enough of this stuff. It is one of the very best incenses ever, and I have tried loads of them. It&#x27;s definitely in my top 3. I do not even have to light it to smell it. If I want a gift box or bag to smell awesome, I stick one in there for a day and then remove it. I put one on the shelf above my bed and it smells so calming and lovely. I put one in my lingerie drawer even. It is a stronger incense (when lit), but in my opinion, not overbearing. A mix of sweet and spicy, I&#x27;d say. Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap. Lights well and all the way through. Quality product. Even fits in my casket incense burner I bought on Amazon - and I mention that because the holes drilled in the casket burner are so small that many other incenses do not work in it.</li>
    <li> I burn a lot of incense, primarily the popular ones like nag champa, pacholi, opium, etc.. this is now my favorite. Whenever this is available I highly recommend it. Burns well, lights quickly, smells amazing and fills the room nicely. Strong notes of sandlewood and cream.</li>
    <li> I am really into burning incense...on a daily basis, multiple times a day to be exact. This incense IS heavenly. As odd as it may sound, smelling this incense makes my mouth water, lol. It&#x27;s THAT good. If it can effect OTHER senses besides smell...its a MUST HAVE. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This package is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  Does not smell too strong.  Living in 1 bedroom apartment I smoke these 2-3 times a day :) love it.  Not like others make you feel like you just walked into the liqueur store, with this incense stick you&#x27;ll feel like walking into India&#x27;s temple!</li>
    <li> this smells soooo good. I don&#x27;t even have to burn it to enjoy it! I keep it in the closet to lightly scent my belongings.&lt;br /&gt;sticks were all intact and didn&#x27;t look dried out.</li>
    <li> When I first burned one of these incense, I was drawn to the exotic fragrance; but after awhile, when burned on the regular, they started getting on my nerves.  The best way for me to appreciate India Temple Incense is to burn occasionally.  This way, I can savor the uniqueness of these.  Yes, I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Favorite incense, we burn it in our apartment daily!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this stuff!  It fills my room and the scent always lasts for so long!</li>
    <li> My wife gets this when we go to San Diego and sometimes we can&#x27;t get away to go grab some for her.  These are an excellent price and I think I&#x27;m going to get them from here for her for now on.</li>
    <li> Very good incense.  I might not suggest that it&#x27;s my favorite of all time but I sincerely enjoyed what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice!</li>
    <li> Hands down best incense makes me feel as if I am back in India trekking through the Himilayas and have stopped off in an ashram.</li>
    <li> This incense is a little too sweet smelling for my taste.  It is pleasant and I will buy again, but in small quantities.</li>
    <li> I thought I may have had some of this before, and it is so highly rated I was sure I would love it.  Unfortunately this is strongly &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; to me, like being in an elevator with an older lady who is a little heavy handed with the perfume and the rouge!  I guess I was expecting something more earthy or .... ?  I don&#x27;t know what I was hoping for, but this isn&#x27;t it.  Still it is good quality incense, and also a good reminder not to buy a big box of something you aren&#x27;t familiar with!</li>
    <li> I enjoy very much the stong, lingering fragrance of this incense.  It creates a suitable atmosphere for meditation and/or any spiritual ritual practice.  I personally find that it transports me to that Indian temple setting, especially with the right music.  Enjoy the experience!</li>
    <li> This incense has a wonderful scent - perhaps I&#x27;m biased, as I&#x27;d previously purchased a double-wick candle, roll-on perfume oil and soap in the same fragrance, so I knew I would like it.  This is also one of the few types of incense that I can burn without aggravating my husband&#x27;s breathing.  I am a practicing Buddhist, though somewhat new to the tradition, and I use this incense and the matching candle when I am meditating, chanting and praying.  It adds a lovely touch to what is already a happy time of my day.  I will buy it again and would recommend to others.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I AM SHOCKED!!! I never liked the strong musky smell of incense &amp; thought i  would try this and WOW! BEAUTIFUL! The notes in it are sweet and flowery and it does not burn the nose! Arrived VERY FAST! Great item, great seller, I WILL BUY MORE FROM SELLER when i am out of this one! Thank YOU!</li>
    <li> I like the scent of these incense sticks. They&#x27;ll make your house smell great even if you just leave them laying on a tray without lighting them.</li>
    <li> Smells luscious. If you love incense, you&#x27;ll love this. Long-lasting , full-bodied aroma.</li>
    <li> Oh My Goodness. This smells amazing. I didn&#x27;t even open the box and I could smell it. You don&#x27;t even have to burn it  to make a room smell good, just leave the box out in the room somewhere.  But when you do burn a stick, it is likely to go through out the entire house.</li>
    <li> I have used this incense for many years.  It&#x27;s scent is absolutely heavenly.....top notes of gardenia, without being overpowering. The incense can be used alone, without burning and the scent distributes itself much like a reed diffuser only better, but once lit absolutely transforms the space you are in.....like walking through a garden on a twilight summer evening. I HIGHLY recommend this product. You will not be sorry. I re-order well before I run out, I can NOT live without this!!</li>
    <li> I went to visit the Lake Shrine temple in Santa Monica and was drawn to a sweet fragrance in the gift store. I enquired with them and bought four packs and gifted them to my family and friends. I too used them and will definitely purchase more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;Sai Tatapudi</li>
    <li> I like this product. The sticks burn very well and seem to be of good quality.  The scent is a little more floral than I prefer; however, I have never been in an actual Indian temple, so I was taking a chance when I ordered it.  My husband really liked the scent, so I think it&#x27;s just a matter of personal preference.</li>
    <li> insants lyk this wun are ver good. hand made nartral sticks. smells so good. not quite like heaven though (as box suggests HAHAHAHAHAHA)</li>
    <li> I purchased this box for my husband, he absolutely loves it. They don&#x27;t sell this scent here in our hometown, so when we go to the coast we usually pick it up there. It&#x27;s definitely the original Song of India incense. :) Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I first bought a small package of this incense at a local shop near where I live.  I fell in love with the fragrance!  So, I did what I usually do.  I checked Amazon for the product and the best price.  I bought the large box here for less money than I spent for the small box that I purchased locally.  I also bought the perfume oil to match, and it is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; fragrance.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this incense....so, let it just suffice to say, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
