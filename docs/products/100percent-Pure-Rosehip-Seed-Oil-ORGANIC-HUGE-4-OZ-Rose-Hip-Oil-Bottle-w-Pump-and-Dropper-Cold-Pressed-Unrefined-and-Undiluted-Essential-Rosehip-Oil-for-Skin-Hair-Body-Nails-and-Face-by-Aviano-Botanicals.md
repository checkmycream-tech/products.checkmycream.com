<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I only use all natural products on my skin and this was my first time trying Rosehip Oil. I am in love! I live in the southwest so finding products to use during the summer is tricky, a lot of oils can feel heavy on my skin in the heat. This Rosehip oil is light, absorbs easily and is just what I was looking for! Can&#x27;t wait to use this product in some face creams I&#x27;m making for teacher gifts as well. This oil will be a staple in my skin care from now on!</li>
    <li> This is a high quality oil just like the peppermint! It also has tons of uses such as helping with wrinkles, dark spots, dry skin, scratchy skin and more.. This oil feels GREAT on skin and I noticed no adverse affects while using it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this oil!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product offered for testing*</li>
    <li> This oil feels lovely on. It has a smooth slip, isn&#x27;t greasy or waxy, soaks right into the skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue. It is also completely scentless, to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says this is an organic, unrefined, cold pressed oil. There&#x27;s also a warning to keep it out of the eyes, and not to take internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle 4 fluid ounces, comes with an airtight cap and plastic seal, plus a pump top option. I removed the caps it arrived in and just use the pump.You do not have a lot of control with the pump - it&#x27;s a bit squirty. Be prepared for that. More comes out with one pump than expected, but I just make sure to use any extra on the backs of my hands. Keep the airtight cap in case you want to take it traveling, since the pump cap doesn&#x27;t lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t heard of using Rosehip as a carrier oil - my husband, who used to be a masseuse, always used almond oil. This oil seems clearer and cleaner, a bit. Less slippery, but I prefer that in a massage. I&#x27;ve been hearing about using coconut oil as a carrier, which seems messy, since coconut oil is a solid at room temps. This rosehip oil is an elegant solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I USE IT FOR:&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve been rubbing it over a scar of mine, just to see if it does anything. It&#x27;s a really old scar, so I don&#x27;t expect much, but we can see.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m experimenting with it as a facial moisturizer. I&#x27;m very particular what I put on my sensitive skin. Almost anything with a scent makes me have a reaction. So I&#x27;m trying this two ways 1. As an all-over night-time facial moisturizer in place of my usual stuff, and 2. as a serum, placed only over the areas that lines are developing (I&#x27;m 47 with very light age lines). My normal-to-aging skin drinks it up and it feels great. I haven&#x27;t had any bad skin  reactions, after a couple weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;- Massage. I&#x27;ve added a drop of peppermint oil to it, which was a bit more revitalizing than I wanted. I want to add some other, more soothing essential oil next, like Chamomile. Since there&#x27;s only 4 ounces to the bottle, this won&#x27;t last long if you do a lot of body massaging. I mostly use this to massage my hands and forearms, and my feet. It&#x27;s really nice to work this into my toes and let it soak into the backs of my heels.&lt;br /&gt;- On my nails. My cuticles in particular, since I have troublesome ones.&lt;br /&gt;- On the ends of my hair, as a sort of serum. Since this is a straight oil, I only use a little and keep it on the ends, so I don&#x27;t get a greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION:&lt;br /&gt;This is an elegant textured oil with a nice array of possible uses. I like that it&#x27;s organic and contains only rosehip oil (and nothing else). With only four ounces, this will probably get used up quickly in my house. Highly recommended for personal hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as a review sample.es to the bottle, this won&#x27;t last long if you do a lot of body massaging.

    <li> This is a very high quality essential oil, I love it! I make my own hair care products me myself and my daughter and I am a big user of essential oils.  I was asked to review this and Rosehip oil is an excellent natural product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil has amazing skin rejuvenating and hair conditioning properties.  This is exceptional for healing, skin care and hair care. I use this in my hair and on my skin, it is an excellent moisturizer and when used on the scalp and help with hair growth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is good for:&lt;br /&gt;Dry hair&lt;br /&gt;Nourishing oil for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Dull hair&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Scar treatment&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff&lt;br /&gt;Sunburn&lt;br /&gt;Nourish brittle nails&lt;br /&gt;Premature aging&lt;br /&gt;Make your skin glow</li>
    <li> I love love love this oil!  I can&#x27;t say enough about it!  My husband&#x27;s hands were cracking and were very painful after he did some gardening a few days ago, well I slathered this on his hands, put some cotton gloves on him and sent him to bed (haha!)  Well, much to his delight and surprise, his hands were much better.  I&#x27;ve used it on my hands, my elbows, a dry patch on my 14 month old&#x27;s leg,  What I love most about it is that its a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil.  It soaks right into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your fingers greasy. I&#x27;m going to be using it as a carrier for some of my favorite scented oils, since for some reason my nose *wanted* it to smell like something.  Marvelous quality, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> First and foremost this product came packaged with no leaks, this is extremely important to me.&lt;br /&gt;I had a horrible allergic reaction to food (common for me) that generally leads to acne like bumps on my face. I used some of this oil and it helped so much not only with the acne like bumps but also with the itchiness of them.&lt;br /&gt;I am new to this whole essential oils game, but I am forever sold on this great Rosehip Seed Oil. I have been reading recently that this product also helps with the formation of grey hair, so that will be the next task at hand. Also in the winter months I find that my nails are not as strong as they are due to the weather and having to have my hands in a lot of water, so I intend to use this for nail strength.&lt;br /&gt;An overall great product that has a fresh smell without being overpowering. A+ all around to me!</li>
    <li> This product is organic as well as being cold pressed, unrefined and undiluted. That being said, I was happy to give it a try. I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy when applied to the skin.  It is great for skin, nail, hair and body. I will be trying it next in a DIY face cream. I received this as complimentary item in return for my unbiased opinion. The packaging is nice and it also comes with a pump should you choose to pump rather than pour. I would highly recommend this oil!</li>
    <li> This product has so many uses. I have used this product on my hair, a sunburn,  my nails, and on my feet.  I LOVE it. It is Organic and does not leave my skin greasy. I also like the fact that it is clear and odorless. It will be great for adding essential oils. The oil was packaged really well with a plastic plug and cap to keep it from spilling during shipping. They were both easy to remove to allow for the screw in the pump. Im happy to be able to review this product and give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is all natural and organic!  I used this on my hair and let it sit for an hour before washing it out and it made my hair so soft and shiny after it dried!  It also helped tone down the frizz.  I also used this on a couple dry patches on my arms and neck and it helped a lot.  It stopped the spots from itching and kept them from getting inflamed.  I will continue to use this product on my hair and skin!</li>
    <li> I have never been able to try Roseship Oil until now!! I am satisfied with this Oil. It isn&#x27;t super greasy like other oils are!&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of Roseship oil are endless! You can use it to keep your hair in place, ,and help the hair follicle strengthen.&lt;br /&gt;You can use on your cuticles, your face-which absorbs into the skin with the Vitamin C and A extracts..helping your face look fresh, clean, toned and tightened.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for two days now, and  face also feels smoother and looks rejuvenated and the dark spots are disappearing. I used it on my hair and wow, is it shiny today! I love the fact that I can use it as a carrier oil with my essential oils, to rub onto my wounds, and this Roseship oil is strong but gentle enough to do that! It doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor like some oils do, and I can&#x27;t stop using it! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;** I received this product to review in exchange for my honest opinion!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m using it on my skin, putting a little in my hair and fsome on my heels....  all which were in horrible condition.  I can honestly say.... in less than a week, the difference is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was breaking off, now I&#x27;m not covering the bathroom counter with hair when I brush it.  My skin was really super dry...  already a marked improvement.  Heels....  100% better.... just in time for flip flop season.  Can&#x27;t say it enough. ... this is THE rose hip oil to get!</li>
    <li> I really like this organic Rosehip oil. My nails where starting to peel so I put this oil on my nails. I only did it one time and my nails stopped peeling. That is great, just one treatment. I love that I can use this oil for many uses. I can use it on wrinkles , fine lines, anti aging (I don&#x27;t have the first 3 yet), scars, acne, dry hair, brittle nails, dandruff, or simply to make your skin glow. That is great that this oil has so many uses. I think it is great when a product has so many uses. I think this product and I recommend it to anyone that wants wonderful skin, hair, and nails. I think this is also a great gift for young and old. I&#x27;m only 35 years old and I love this product. I recommend it for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product at a great deal to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I had read about the benefits of Rosehip Oil and wanted to try it but hesitated as it was an investment for my family&#x27;s hair ans skin. I was given the opportunity to try this product at a reduced price and I tell you this is WORTH EVERY PENNY!  The box arrived very quickly, it was in a small box that contained the oil in a sturdy plastic bottle and you have 2 options, a regular screw top or a pump top. I chose to use the pump top and it gives you the perfect amount. you need. It leaves the most luxurious fragrance free sheen on your skin and after you rub it on your skin, rub the light oil onto your hair, it makes both your skin and hair so soft and luxurious feeling and looking. My daughter is mix raced and I am always looking for new products to keep her hair soft and conditioned. This is really nice to use on her hair in the morning when we are on the go, at night I put 2 pumps in my hands and run through her hair and it helps to keep her hair lush and hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Rose hip seed oil is high in the essential fatty acids: linoleic acid or omega-6, and linolenic acid or omega-3. It is commonly used in skin care products. It is commonly used for a variety of skin conditions, including dermatitis, acne and eczema, for mature and sun burnt skin as well as brittle nails and wrinkles. Rose hip oil is also frequently used to heal scarring and diminish photo-aging.[2]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It quickly absorbs into the skin replenishing moisture and creates a protective barrier on the skin to help prevent dehydration&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I absolutely love love love this one.</li>
    <li> My SO and I enjoyed this simple and versatile oil. It was well-made and easy to pump from the bottle. It’s wonderful for removing makeup without harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have also found it’s also great for an evening facial moisturizer. Also, we added it to our homemade facial wash with tea tree oil, Castille soap, and distilled water. It adds just the right amount of softness while helping to cleanse the face. We highly recommend this product! We rcvd a sample for review.</li>
    <li> This rosehip oil absorbs quickly into your skin. I do have oily skin and when I put this rosehip oil on my face it made my face a little oily and somewhat soft. My skin seems to be brighter after using this product on my face. You don&#x27;t need that much of this product when you are using it on your face a little bit goes a long way. I did put it on my hair as a mask for a few minutes and my hair looked healthier. Also it helped with my dandruff after just one use of this oil. I had dandruff flakes before using this rosehip oil but now I have a few dry patches. Also it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent its a very mild scent. I was able to get this rosehip oil for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 100% Pure Rosehip Organic Oil by Aviano Botanicals. You get a big bottle (4 oz) of  Cold Pressed, Unrefined and Undiluted oil and I am so glad I did after reading the list of  hair and skin problems it helps. Rosehip oil is an excellent way to put Vitamin C into your skin, hair, nails. It is instantly absorbed by the skin, hair and nails. A little goes a long way so this bottle should last you quite a while. It also comes with a pump separate so you can pour from the bottle or mist it on with the pump. I love the fact that the product is organic. There is hardly any scent to it at all. Don&#x27;t expect rosehip oil to smell like roses because it is made from the rosehips, not the flower. Rosehip oil helps to reduce scarring. I am using it on some surgical scars and my acne scars on my face. So far there has been a tiny bit of scar fading which I hope becomes more visible the longer I use the oil. This is my honest opinion after trying this product.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a dark oil in a dark bottle. This oil and the bottle are both clear!  The oil is fairly thick,  but absorbs readily. When I realized I had confused this with rosehips seed oil,  I was pleased surprised. A new oil for so many purposes.  I am starting with these cuticles!</li>
    <li> I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try a lot of skin care items on a continuous basis and have lately gone through a ton of rosehip oils. This is the first that was a light greenish color which indicates a cold-pressed version. This means the oil offers most of the great benefits but is light which means it absorbs faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently started using rosehip oil daily because it is supposed to be good for skin&#x27;s elasticity, etc. So far, this oil absorbs nicely and does not leave a greasy feeling. I prefer using this on my the ends of my hair because of that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the packaging because it&#x27;s a plastic bottle that comes in a shrinked-wrapped box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good version of rosehip oil, especially for those looking for organic/fast absorbing.</li>
    <li> The seller provided this item to me free or nearly free and asked me to provide my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY happy with this product. Rosehip Oil has no odor and it works well on either your hair or skin. It&#x27;s great for your face, I used it every day as a moisturizer and because it&#x27;s natural and organic it does not irritate my very sensitive skin. It leaves my skin feeling very, very soft. I used it everywhere. Face, hands, neck, feet, legs, lips, elbows. I add a little bit to my shampoo a couple times each week and it leaves my hair very soft and I have no split ends. I also use it to rub on my nails and cuticles daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this comes with a pump rather than a dropper. This is my new very favorite all-over moisturizer. I would be lost without it. Very high quality. And works as a massage lotion too. Excellent! Thank you for letting me try and review this product. I&#x27;ll buy this one and use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!! My husband has been using this on his feet which are the worst dry and cracked feet I have ever seen. His calluses and corns have softened and the podiatrist says they should be able to be taken care of with corn pads and keep using the rosehip oil. He&#x27;s scheduled to go back in 2 months for a check up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all love this product. I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful it is. Simply amazing.</li>
    <li> Av&amp;iacute;anō Botanicals extra virgin rosehip oil has been fabulous for my nails! I use a bit every morning and my nails are growing beautifully! It absorbs quickly and is non greasy. A great oil!</li>
    <li> It is truly awesome. very soothing for the skin.</li>
    <li> This is really great quality rosehip oil! I love that it came with the pump top and dropper top! It is so easy to get the product where I want it without a mess, because I can use either top for different purposes! *I received a discount in order to leave an honest and unbiased opinion. The views in this review are completely my own!*</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now.  Received as part of a promotion, but man is it perfect.  I use along my hairline and on troubled spots on my skin and all over my face.  It leaves my skin soft &amp; supple all day, it makes my make up application a lot smoother and softens  my hair and less scalp itching. It is scentless and not greasy. I apply more to problem areas on my skin and hoping for great results over time . I know i&#x27;ll be back to purchase, glad I decided to try  it out.</li>
    <li> I received this at a great discount to review. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now on my inner thighs and I can tell the skin is a little more taut. I think I&#x27;ll continue to use this. No weird odor and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very nice consistency, does not leave hand feeling too oily. The packaging is really nice too. Comes in a box and plastic sealed.</li>
    <li> I love to make my own lotions and blends. This oil is the best. I love it. I received this oil to review.</li>
    <li> I had the pleasure of receiving this full size (4 oz) bottle of Organic Rosehip Oil complimentary in exchange I would test it out and give my honest feedback in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product. It was shipped securely and properly and came with a really nice pump dispenser. I am always in favor of pump dispenser because it allows for better control when dispensing the oil and there is absolutely no waste and no contamination. This oil is 100% Pure Organic and I am really seeing a big difference in the texture of my hair, skin and nails. Those are the primary areas I use this amazing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on my skin like silk and has really made an improvement in the look and feel of my skin. It is well hydrated, radiant and baby soft. My hands are always in water and that has a tendency to dry them out severely. I like to massage Rosehip oil into my hands daily and from the very first application I saw immediate results. Plus it helped heal the areas of my skin that were cracked. The same can be said for my feet. It&#x27;s scandal season and I would not be caught dead without my daily dose of Rosehip oil massaged into to my heals and the dry spots on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like to use this 100% Pure Organic Rosehip Oil as part of my hair care routine. As a licensed Cosmetologist I understand the damage coloring and daily blowing drying has on my hair; especially since I have baby fine hair to begin with. You would think that applying oil to fine, thin hair would make it look flat and greasy but it doesn&#x27;t. In fact, just the opposite is true because it is lightweight and my hair follicles soak up all that wonderful hydrating goodness. I use a couple of pumps of oil per use (so, not very much at all, because a little goes a long way) and massage it into the dry ends of my hair in addition to conditioner. I usually like to let it soak in for a few minutes while I wash up, shave my legs, etc. When I&#x27;m done I simply rinse and towel dry my hair and presto - no more dry, damaged ends. I can blow dry and style as usual and my hair looks healthy, shiny, hydrated and full of body. In my daughter&#x27;s case (she has course, very thick hair) she is able to apply Rosehip Oil to her damp hair after a shower and she just lets her hair air dry. She has amazing locks that are so healthy and shiny, all thanks in part to 100% Pure Organic Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is really an amazing product with so many wonderful uses. I&#x27;ve only scratched the surface on what this oil can do. So if you are contemplating trying Rosehip Oil, I say &amp;#34;go for it&amp;#34; the results are nothing less than miraculous. Thank you for taking the time to read this review and I hope I have helped you become a more informed consumer by me sharing my experience with this miracle oil. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I For This At A Discount In Exchange For An Honest Review. I Love This, It Makes My Hair And Skin So Soft And Healthy. True To The Title It Has No Added Anything In It, I Would HavepPreferred A Little Fragrance To It, But Then It Wouldn&#x27;t Be 100% Pure Lol.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil helps in reducing Acne Scars,Sunburns,Dark spots,wrinkles.Its great for dry skin issues! I have some serious dry skin now that the weather has turned nice in western new york. I love using this because it is quickly absorbed without making you feel greasy! This was on a promotional price and I am so happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> I actually have dry skin very badly. Not just my scalp but my face as well. I was actually able to test out this oil for free. The oil did not burn (which is the main issue I have with products) it left my face shiny which is great for me since it is usually dry skin chipping. Most oils or lotions that I use lasts for 4 minutes at the most. I must admit this oil last longer!! Being that my skin (mostly around my nose and and cheeks) stay dry it leaves an embarrassing feeling...especially when you are speaking to someone and you KNOW they are focusing on the dry patches of skin on your face. I am glad I was able to test out this product and find something that doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily looking with dry skin patches still visible (yes that is possible and I am proof). Will definitely recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s looking for a light oil to go on your face, hair and nails!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product, to my very surprise I really liked it, I suggest that everyone give it a try. You won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
    <li> I did not really know what to expect when I received this. I have really dry skin and a dry scalp, and I was hoping that this would help with those! While I am still testing to see how this works over a longer time period, I have to say that the couple of days that I have been using it have really helped my skin and my scalp. I have used it on my scalp twice, just putting it directly on my scalp and leaving on for about twenty minutes before I rinse it out. Just doing that has made it not so dry and itchy! I have also used it on my elbows, hands, and feet before I go to bed. My hands and elbows are slightly less dry, and my feet really is showing a difference! There are so many other uses for this that I have not used yet, I am slightly scared to try this on my face, as my face is very sensitive and prone to breakouts, but I am really happy with how I have been using it!</li>
    <li> I used this oil to remove some scars,n so far so good.you can put the pump on or just closed it with the cap.I have seen some changes in my scars,there lighter.I received this oil for review in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Good shipment and Good quality. has little smell but good</li>
    <li> Vitamin oh yeah let me tell you my honest experience for this product you gonna read it or not but I will still keep writing so everyone knows what&#x27;s the effect of this product to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my hair my long nail skin and body ...&lt;br /&gt;-But.. I hate my nail when its always start broken in the middle when I&#x27;m trying to make them grow so i can put my favorite nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;-My hair is damage cause by too much ironing or using differents shampoo&lt;br /&gt;-My skin is so dry even I&#x27;m using expensive lotion to it..&lt;br /&gt;All of this problem I found this Pure Rosehip Oil Organic and solve all of my problem.&lt;br /&gt;Make my skin healthy.&lt;br /&gt; I used it for moisturize my face before putting makeup&lt;br /&gt; I used for make up remover&lt;br /&gt; I used it lotion for my body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All great effect for me!</li>
    <li> Excellent, pure and great quality. Would definitely reccomend to friend and family.</li>
    <li> I Have never used rosehip oil before and frankly have never heard of it, but I love different oils and love to use pure organic oils on my skin and hair, as soon as I recieved this two days after ordering I washed my face and pop open the box, washed my face! I sprayed a little in my hand and realize A LITTLE goes a LONG WAY!  the amount I put in my hands are what I usually use with my other  Oils but I was able to grease my hands, face and elbows, This bottle is going to last me a long time.  it has  left my face nice and smooth ! In the morning when I wokeup my face was still baby butt smooth, Thank you I think this will be my staple item for my skin, hair and nails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I love to eat pineapple an i would literally eat at lease 1-2 per day when they go on sale, well the downside to eating that many pineapple is both corner of my lips start to feel like someone was rubbing a grater across an di can harly open my mouth plus it burns, well i decided to put Rose hip oil on it an immediately  the burn subsided, when i woke up in the morning it felt like nothing was there int he first place an everything was back to normal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you rose hip oil</li>
    <li> Beautiful oil. I use this on my face in the evenings before bed. Also wonderful on the hands and feet, leaves my skin so soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I used this on my fingernails after I took of a gel manicure at home. It helped repair my nails in about 2 days using it twice a day. Haven&#x27;t tried it on my dry ends yet but will be trying it there next.</li>
    <li> I loved it I just wished the packaging was better</li>
    <li> This would make an excellent addition to anyone&#x27;s OCM (oil cleansing method) routine popularized by reddit. If you believe that rosehip oil is your moisturizer of choice, I highly recommend making a purchase from Aviano. They are a small, family-operated group with a great attitude and I have seen first-hand the pleasant and helpful attitude of their customer service representatives.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil on my hands, face, and hair. It absorbs very quickly, not leaving an oily film like lotions. It has a very nice fragrance, not too sharp like other oils I have tried in the past. My skin is normally so dry due to working in a school cafeteria that I have to constantly wash hands. Once I started using this oil it has greatly reduced my dry skin.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a smell and makes me glow. I haven&#x27;t used it for long but seen results already, it&#x27;s been only a few days. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I have used rose hip oil for several years and it is a huge help. This bottle is a lot bigger than what I expected and it was packaged nice when I received it in the mail. I have used several different brands but this is going to be one of my new favorites</li>
    <li> Rose hip oil is an all around great product to have in your home. It&#x27;s extremely beneficial for both your skin and your hair. I add a few drops to my homemade face scrub&lt;br /&gt; recipe I use:&lt;br /&gt; 1 Cup baking soda&lt;br /&gt;mild baby soap of choice added to desired thickness  (i use approximately 1/2 cup)&lt;br /&gt;and a dropper full of this Organic rosehip oil and about 4 drops of lavender essential oil (not only for smell but for cleansing properties)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rose hip oil makes your feel moisturized and gives you a subtle glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a promotional discount however my reviews remain honest</li>
    <li> Very nice! Sturdy bottle, great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Rosehip oil mainly as a moisturizer for my face and body, and I am loving it. I have noticed that with other bands of rosehip oil it is usually tinted a sort of orangish color which can sometimes stain and I find it very annoying. This Rosehip Oil by Aviano Botanicals is clear so that is not an issue. It also has no scent which i love because a lot of scents give me a migraine and I really hate mixzing scents. One of my favorite things about this particular bottle of Rosehip Oil is that it comes with a pump instead of a dropper like I usually see. This makes it so much easier to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> this product has no smell which is awesome!  it is oil so it does leave a little bit of a residue but it works into your skin quite nicely! I have been using it on a surgical scar I got back in March. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days now,I am happy to say that my scar is already going from angry pink to a lighter pink! it&#x27;s always nice to see a product working.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this! I&#x27;ve been using it in the mornings for a little over a week. It makes my face and neck so soft and it&#x27;s improving my complexion. I&#x27;ll be using this stuff forever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have tried so many beauty products that promise you&#x27;ll see your fine lines and wrinkles just about disappear. Firmer  skin. More even skin tone and lessening of age spots and freckles. And that you&#x27;ll see changes in 4 to six weeks . They also state that 85 to 90 percent of women can a test to seeing huge changes. Well, it seems that I&#x27;m always in that small percentage that not only doesn&#x27;t see and reduction in the fine lines  or in my wrinkles. Actually my skin just ends up looking a lot worse than it had before I stated to use their product. SO DEPRESSING !! I ALWAYS END UP FEELING LIKE A FOOL AND RIPED OFF!! I just about gave up..then I saw this product and figured I&#x27;d give it a try, being that it&#x27;s all natural and all the great reviews I had read about it. I have been using this along with Rosemary Essential oil mixed with pure Argon oil for about a week or so now.I can tell you it&#x27;s a NIGHT AND DAY DIFFERENCE! !! I wish I had taken pic of what my skin looked like before I started this regime.  I will tell you that it has smoothed out my skin. It&#x27;s so soft! It also has plumped it up, made it brighter and more even toned ,  Age spots and freckles and  my fine lines  are just about gone. The laugh lines and smokers lines around  the mouth are fading fast!  My skin is also tighter  and my lips are fulller, and plumper ! I&#x27;m a 55 year old cancer survivor 3 times around. And besides all the side effects that years of chemo  and the many meds I endured not only destroyed  and depleted my skin and hair, on top of that I had to to a radical hysterectomy and couldn&#x27;t take HRT replacement .so there also went the estrogen needed to keep your skin youthful and thick along with helping with collagen cell turn over, not to mention hair becoming like straw .falling out and breaking.  I had nothing. I&#x27;m saying this is the miracle I&#x27;ve waited years for!! Excellent product!! Fantastic for your hair to.My hair is not only softer,but so much more  healthier, it&#x27;s also growing in faster and theres also new hair where it was thinning out!! No more hair all over the bathroom floor or in my hair brush!!!  I&#x27;m so happy.!!!. For those of you who&#x27;ve been through what I have, please do give this a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed and your money will be well spent!!  I&#x27;ll never let myself be without it!!! Finally and product that truly gives you results!</li>
    <li> I received my rosehip oil and was eager to try it. The first thing I noticed was there was no odor to it. I love oils and use them a lot. I wanted to try it on my face first. Of course did the daily routine of cleaning my face and put on some of this oil on. The first thing I notice was, it went on easy and absorbed well into my face and no shinny look, which I liked. One of my friends told me I was glowing. I thought could the rose hip work that fast. I don&#x27;t think so but it was nice to hear that. In any case I also wanted to use it on my hair and my sons hair. It made my hair soft and shiny. My son has very dry hair and it made his hair look really nice and soft and shiny also. I got this product discounted, for an honest opinion. Like I said before I love oils. I must say I like this oil.  I like that it is organic, since I don&#x27;t like putting harsh chemicals anywhere on my body. It has many uses, so I will take advantage of that, and it makes a nice carrier for your essential oils. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Aviano is one of my favorite oil providers. I am a proud owner and consumer of their oils due to their outstanding costumer service and their high quality oils. Their oils are 100% pure, organic and natural. The rosehip oil was beautifully packaged and once my order arrived I immediately tried some on as a moisturizer. The bottle is larger than I expected and the pump is very unique because this is the very first rosehip oil I have purchased that comes with a pump! Most essential oils come with droppers which is fine, but I absolutely LOVE the pump. It makes it way easier to dispense the oil for quick and effective use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil as a moisturizer and my skin loves the smooth and non-greasy feeling. The oil is quickly absorbed onto my skin and I am now getting rid of all my lotions with added alcohol and chemicals. Rosehip oil is a natural moisturizer without any of the preservatives and unhealthy additives for the skin! I also have been using this oil regularly to treat my husbands feet eczema. I apply 4-5 pumps of oil on my hand and give him a foot rub at night and watch the oil do wonders! My husband loves the oil and has told me that the itchiness and overly dry skin have greatly ceased since I have been rubbing his feet with this oil. I am sure there are tons of other uses for rosehip oil, but I primarily use it to treat dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I purchased this product during a one time promotional period! The oil is high quality and leaves the skin very moisturized and refreshed. I feel great using a product that is natural and will only benefit my skin and my husband&#x27;s feet. I would highly recommend this product to anyone in search of a natural moisturizer and I am proud to say this review is all based on my own experiences. I also apply the rosehip oil on my face occasionally and have begun to see a new glow in my skin! I absolutely love Aviano&#x27;s organic rosehip oil!</li>
    <li> I am pleased to share my opinion on this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to try this Av&amp;iacute;anō Botanicals Rosehip Organic oil..This can be used for hair therapy too..My husband has dandruff issues so we tried this to his scalp and hair, we left it in over night. the next morning his scalp wasn&#x27;t dry the hair left shinny. It comes in a easy pump bottle, has a beautiful rose smile to it. I received this Rosehip oil for testing in exchange to my honest and unbiased opinion and this opinion is solely mine</li>
    <li> Love this and I am so glad I came across this product! Not only is it great for simple everyday uses but it smells wonderful. Anyone looking into essential oils this is a product to try out first!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received items for testing and review purposes!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using this Rosehip oil for about 6mo since I read about its wrinkle fighting properties. I live in Florida and am in the sun a lot so I was naturally worried about sun damage and pre-mature wrinkles. I love this stuff! It is lightweight and very absorbent. I use it at night as my nighttime moisturizer and my skin looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> I have eczema. So I&#x27;m always looking for relief. I&#x27;m giving this a try. I have an active patch right now. It seems to be helping. Very moisturizing but to too oily. I have not broken out yet. Minimal smell. Absorbs quick. I&#x27;ll keep using it an update my review after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> So this oil is a God send. I was thinking to myself, ok what can I use this for. Well.....i opened the box. The bottle had a dropper top and came with a pump top which was very convenient. I put this oil on my legs and under arms and arms as a preshave kind of thing. Went shave and wow, my legs were extremely smooth. 2 days later and they are still smooth and it seems the hair isn&#x27;t prickly like the normal grow back is. I&#x27;m in live with this oil. And of course all its other amazing things it&#x27;s used for. Must order more. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> It is great!  It goes into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue at all on the skin or if it gets on your clothes.  It feels refreshing and honestly makes your skin feel so much better and relaxed.  I am looking forward to having it help rehydrate my skin.</li>
    <li> I use rosehip oil for only one reason; which is to eliminate and improve the stretch marks in my thighs. I know that it will take more time to see dramatic results, but rosehip oil itself is proven to work. This product in particular is certified organic and it comes with a pump! I like that very much since it makes application easier, and it being organic gives me more confidence that i get the best out of it. I purchase this product using a promo code for review</li>
    <li> Personally I love any type of oil though argan and rosehip are my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I found this oil to be pretty basic, nothing too extraordinary, its your basic rosehip oil. The dropper is nice and the bottle is actually very nicely sized. It actually comes with a pump and a dropper which is fantastic! Another difference I found with this one is that it comes in such nice box. It isn&#x27;t just the oil but it did come with the box which was pretty awesome! Definitely would make for some nice presentation and as a gift.Overall I would say this oil is great but the features are definitely what make it stand out! *Product was given as a gift to review*</li>
    <li> This is a large bottle for the price considering it is organic.  Feel amazing on the skin and have used it to tame my hair if it gets frizzy.  This bottle will last a LONG time, you only need a few drops to be effective. I&#x27;ve been using it at night after washing my face and my skin glows. Great product.</li>
    <li> I like this oil. for it being my first time using an oil  I was very happy with this one doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy after applying it which I love . It absorbs into the skin quick and leaves it feeling soft. I also used it on my cuticles and it left my nails and hands so soft . It&#x27;s been a week since I allied it and my cuticles are still soft no cracking on my fingers or around my nails so that&#x27;s definitely  a plus. As for applying it anywhere else other then my skin I haven&#x27;t done that . Very happy I receive this product free for review.</li>
    <li> One of the best uses for Rosehip Oil is fading of dark spots from sun damage. So when I was offered this 100% Pure Organic Rosehip Oil with a pump and a dropper for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered some. I liked that it came with options as far as dispensing the rosehip oil, and I decided to stick with the pump for now. It comes out nicely and absorbs into my skin quickly. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my dark sun spots yet, but it&#x27;s only been a week. I know that there will be great results in the near future. I definitely recommend this Organic Rosehip Oil for anyone who wants a great product.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product on various spots (scars acne and skin) and have had a variety of results. I did not see any results on any of my old scars but a week is not really a lot of time to let something work. As for acne it may be helping but them heal faster but I need to try it out more before I go one way or another on it. Now for the skin that is another story. I have applied to my skin a few times and it does make it feel nice and smooth. I use lotion as well and sometimes my skin will feel too oily. Now I know this is oil and should make my skin feel that way but this does not do it. I am very pleased with what it does for my skin. I will update more on the other stuff once I have given more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product was received for free I attest this is my honest and true opinion.</li>
    <li> Great! Tightens the skin and helps improve skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne or black heads on your nose .. this will definitely help make the pores appear smaller giving your skin a more clean and healthy appearance. Also helps with wrinkles and general skin imperfections.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this even after one use my scalp stopped itching. I like that it came with a pump also.</li>
    <li> My son has been using this as a part of his skin care regimen and in just a short time I can already see the difference.  This oil comes in a very generous 4 oz side which is a pleasant departure from those super small bottles that I&#x27;m used to with the Doterra oils.  It is pure and organic which is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I&#x27;ve also used a little on my heels so that they can soften up a bit and it has been working like a charm.  I received a promotional price on this product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works I put it on my finger nails and by three days my nails were strong and hard to break before I used to chip them and now they didn&#x27;t  chip love this stuff will be using it on my hair next,</li>
    <li> I have whole collection of essential oils, I like my essential oils to be organic.It&#x27;s been a while that I have stopped using cosmetics product on my face.I can surely see the results, my face has never been so flawless and full of glow.I have oily skin and used to suffer from acne.If you have oily skin rosehip oil is your true friend, it is so lite and non greasy that your skin absorbs it quickly.It is colorless and has no smell, leaves you with glowing skin without making any greasy mess.I got this product at discounted rate in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> To be honest I wasn&#x27;t completely sure what to expect when I got this product! I had never heard of or seen Rosehip Oil, so I was taking a plunge hoping for good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luck sided with me and I&#x27;m very grateful for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has many uses, and I decided to use it as a moisturizer and dandruff prevention &#x27;assistant&#x27;. This means every day I applied the oil to my hands face and scalp. After a few days I am already seeing a major difference. I have significantly less dry skin, and I have had close to no flaked coming off of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil also has many other uses, it can be used to help sooth and heal burns as well as be used minimize scars. I haven&#x27;t been able to use it for those purposes but I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;d do them both very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the oil is doing an awesome job, and I think more people should use this type!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Moisturizes well.&lt;br /&gt;2) Fixes dandruff problems!&lt;br /&gt;3) Has many other uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The sprayer on the bottle doesn&#x27;t work that great.</li>
    <li> Amazing miracle oil!! Got this on a very good discounted price and its really a great product. I am really impressed with this oil. My skin scars are getting lighter day by day. Amazing product. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Have been using it on my face after washing it twice a day.  Its a bit oily as expected.  It has helped me with my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample for review</li>
    <li> So my girls suffer from eczema and I still have scars from when I had chickenpox years ago. So when I read that it would reduce the appearance of scars, I had to try it. This Rosehip oil did not disappoint. It eased the itchy scaly patches on my girls and started to even out the scars.</li>
    <li> I have really been using Vitamin C serum for lots of things.  In a way I see this organic Rosehips oil as an oil that I will use in the same way...a hand and heel softener, a light hair oil and a night time oil are just a few of the ways that I am using this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thank you to the manufacturer for providing me with this oil.</li>
    <li> I love this rosehip oil! It sinks into the skin without leaving it greasy. Rosehip oil is a great carrier oil for essential oils. I like to put  frankincense into this bottle of rosehip oil. It makes a wonderful night moisturizer for face, neck and hands. I can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin is in the morning!</li>
    <li> Discounted price.  My wife loves this stuff.  Great price!</li>
    <li> I love to try and mix different types of oils for my hair and skin. Rosehip oil is one of the oil that use on my skin, every two to three days. It leaves my skin nice, soft and moisturized. It gets absorbed into skin instantly. It is almost odorless.  I also add few drops of this oil castor oil and herbal oil and apply to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received.</li>
    <li> one of the reasons i got this is because i have some scars  that are very easy to see and i am hopping it will make them kinda disappear. and i have really dry skin i have been using this for about a week now and it is really nice to use i like it because it absorbs so well and it is not sticky or makes you look like you have oily face hands.  i recommend to put this on 2 times a day in the morning and night if you us it for your hands and face but for your hair i would just mix it in your shampoo or even just in your hair it wont leave your hair look oily.</li>
    <li> I am highly satisfied with this Rosehip Oil. It&#x27;s organic, which is very important to me. It is really good for my skin. I use it as a part to help me get my makeup off at night. I get acne from time to time and this oil helped me to get rid of it much faster than usual. I also use it for my elbows and hands. It doesn&#x27;t have any strong smell at all. My nails get brittle sometimes so I know I&#x27;ll be able to use this oil at that time too. It comes sealed in a box and a pump is separate, which is nice since you may not want to use it and just use it as a bottle. It&#x27;s a large bottle and it&#x27;ll last me for a long time. I really appreciate the opportunity to get a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> I love the organic rosehip seed essential oil.  It is a skin must have.  I use this essential oil to moisturize my dry skin on my hands and around my eyes as an anti-aging agent.  The oil spreads really well and is very light.  The scent is not over bearing at all.  My hands looks wonderful after using this product.  I have also used this product to treat my two year olds eczema with wonderful results.  After years of trying many different creams and lotions this oil has practically gotten rid of her eczema in a short week.  I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Aviano sent me both the peppermint oil and the rosehip oil for review.  I like very much the peppermint oil, as mentioned in my review, and can say the same for the rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that the  rosehip oil is clear and has no smell, at least that I can detect.  After showering in the evening, I twice squirted the oil into the palm of my hand, rubbed it around, and then messaged my face, hair, and neck with the oil.  I noticed no greasiness whatsover.  In fact, the oil was immediately absorbed into my skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the benefits?  Everywhere I went on the Internet I found good things about rosehip oil such as: 1. skin rejuvenation; 2. improved complexion; 3. moisture retention; 4. healthy nails; and that is just a start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aviano says: &amp;#34;we pride ourselves on making sure our Rosehip oil is better than the rest to insure that you receive all of the Therapeutic Qualities of this amazing oil.&amp;#34;  This appears to be correct.  I agree with the Amazon reviewers who are unanimous in their support of this product.</li>
    <li> Having never heard of Organic Rosehip oil before, I was reading about the benefits of this product and decided I needed to order this and see how it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was chosen to test and review this product.&lt;br /&gt;Love the pump feature, so much easier than trying to pour oils out of a bottle, much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;The Rosehip oil has been working really well on my extra dry and shriveled looking hands. Gardening season is so rough on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;So far my hands are feeling and looking so much better! I even massaged this into my legs after shaving, real nice, and moisturizing. Nice light scent, not overpowering. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> very good product, smells great</li>
    <li> Soothing and helps with dry skin.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with a dropper as pictured. Don&#x27;t even bother using the pump that it comes with. You will just be wasting product. I combine this oil with other oils for a face serum and do notice more hydration to my skin. I&#x27;ve been applying it directly on a few surgical cuts hoping it will help keep me from scaring too much. I can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s working or not.</li>
    <li> I thought the dropper was a plus, and found the pump in the box as well, came early, happy with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Rosehip Oil on my stretchmarks on my stomach and they are helping them to lighten them. I will continue to use! I want them gone lol. received at discount price for honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Comes in an ultra large bottle, I will be able to use this for a long time to come. I love that it has the squirty dispenser top, instead of the dropper or regular opening. The smell of it is better than most of the other brands I have tried previously. I love that it is organic, too.&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> This oil is a fake please do your homework.  Below is the picture of real rosehip seed oil.  If this is organic, cold press and unrefined it should not look like the clear picture of oil that someone posted in their hand.  Please educate yourself before buying any oil or essential oil.  I made the same mistake but had to educated myself really quick</li>
    <li> Very good oil and I love to use it.</li>
    <li> Received a discount fit my opinion. This is great for your face and skin. It makes your hair nice too.</li>
    <li> This rosehip oil is 100% organic and claims to be able to rejuvenate skin, hair, brittle nails, and other skin problems like scarring and flaking.  It is packaged in a cardboard box that instructions printed on it for using the oil.  They were a bit vague but I guess the application of oil to skin isn&#x27;t rocket science.  It would have been nice to have a little bit of advice for amounts, though.  The bottle is shipped with a screw-top lid protecting a stopper in the bottle neck to prevent leakage.  There is also a pump top in the box that the user can  quickly attach for easier use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is very light and soaks in quickly, so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy all day long.  It has no odor, which makes rosehip oil an excellent carrier oil for essential oils.  I tested it with a variety of essential oils, including the frankincense with which it was shipped, and found that in each case it protected my skin from sensitivity reaction to the other oils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I could not believe it.  After I applied the Rosehip oil to my upper lip with the fine little wrinkles, they were gone.  The oil leaves a gentle but steady surface of softness.  It has a very gentle aroma and very nice on the skin.  This is a blue ribbon product.</li>
    <li> This oil is so soft on my skin , hair &amp; nails. I use it instead of lotion , it gives my skin a glowy look. It has also helped my hair grow which was short &amp; falling out before I had thin edges n split ends it has improved my hair a lot!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works miracles on dry skin! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year. I tried the radha brand and went back to aviano. Aviano rosehip oil has better results to me. It def keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for the skin.  Loved it.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this Rosehip Oil! I have been using it on some dry spots on my skin and it has helped tremendously in just a few uses. it feels so great on my skin not to oily. My daughter has Eczema and had tried so many product to clear up her skin and just a few times using this Rosehip oil she has already seen a difference in her skin. I&#x27;m excited to continue using this. Thanks again Aviano for another great product.</li>
    <li> I see the difference in this product all ready.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it came packed very well. I have been using it on my skin and it works great. I also loved that is came with a pump.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a greatly reduced price because I was willing to give my honest opinion about it. I love rosehip oil and it makes your skin feel wonderful It is a great moisturizer that lasts all day..</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband.  I tried rosehip oil a few months ago and really liked how it helped my dry skin.  My husband then started using it daily on his ashy legs.  I will say he had tried just about everything but still had a few dry patches on his legs that wouldn&#x27;t go away.  His father has legs just like that (only older and much worse) so my husband started stressing out thinking his legs were going to be just like his fathers.  That got him pretty devoted to his rosehip oil.  He ran out and I had to get him more (or else I&#x27;d never hear the end of it).  This 100% pure organic rosehip oil is great.  It really makes a difference in his dry skin patches.  I know it can be used for so many other things as well but for now I&#x27;m leaving it right where he looks for it every day...I know better than to mess with his rosehip oil.  Product received for testing, evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> * Product sample provided for review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never used Rosehip oil before trying out this product. To tell you how little I knew about it...I thought it was an essential oil--like rosemary or lemon balm. It&#x27;s actually a scentless base or &amp;#34;carrier&amp;#34; oil. It leaves NO residue, which is a pet peeve of mine when dealing with oils and skin creams. The oil absorbs quickly, and the improvement to the skin area is immediate. I have seriously dry skin and this oil made my problem spots...elbows, feet...look and feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned about the pump top, but it worked fine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil as a sample for review and evaluation and I love it. I wanted something organic and with a pump so this has been perfect. I use this mostly on my face and it gives me a nice healthy glow. I have combination skin so I can get oily but this hasn&#x27;t made it worse or caused any irritation it’s been acting more like a moisturizer so I like that. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky or oily residue so I can apply my make up shortly after. As for the scent I don&#x27;t notice much of one (it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses) so that&#x27;s nice since I can sometimes be overwhelmed by powerful scents. Now that I know the oil works well I’m going to try and start using it on a scar to see if I get any results. I’ll update this review with the progress.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to a friend she loves it</li>
    <li> This is 100% pure. I use it on my skin and it keeps my skin clear especially from acne. I have severe acne and it has dimished because of this. Softens my skin like a babies bottom. Great on my hair and I have natural hair.</li>
    <li> Really am enjoying this oil.  Scent is nice and I am exploring other ways to use Rosehip Oil.</li>
    <li> Helps my VERY dry nails and skin.</li>
    <li> I usually make my own face serum with essential oils but was glad that I got this rosehip oil.  Now I only use it with my moisturizer and it leaves my skin feeling soft.  I definitely recommend this oil to any skin type (I have oily skin).</li>
    <li> Excellent quality oil. Hydrates our skin well. We&#x27;ve been using it in our conditioner as well and our hair has become really soft and shiny. The bottle is pretty big and the dropper helps with adding it to our conditioner.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Quick delivery. Would order again.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. This makes my skin feel and look great.</li>
    <li> have not used for very long but leaves my face feeling very soft</li>
    <li> 100% Pure Rosehip Oil - I bought this on a promo to try out and review.  I have been really getting into all natural skin care this year and wanting to try different essential oils.  I love this Rosehip oil on the face - I have been using it on my skin after cleansing with the all natural bentonite clay mask and my skin looks and feels fantastic.  I am now a fan! huge bottle for the price too!</li>
    <li> My wife uses oils a lot, she uses them in homemade hair/skin products and cloth wipe solution for our baby. she&#x27;s very satisfied with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it every. I expect its effect. Thanks, Seller.</li>
    <li> I use this on the ends of my hair. It works great providing an extra moisturizer. But becareful because a little goes a long way or else you&#x27;ll end up looking like a greasy monkey. I like that the scent of the oil is light and it does smell good.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil: This is one of the best treatments for adding moisture and a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my face that I have ever tried. I used it by spraying one spritz onto my hand and then massaging it into my face and neck (after a shower). It goes on very smoothly and is fully absorbed into the skin within an hour, so you won&#x27;t feel any residue on your face. It&#x27;s an ideal treatment for night-time skin care and will leave you skin soft and dewy without being too greasy. The most interesting part is that, though it is an oil, I didn&#x27;t find that it left my skin shiny or looking &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as some moisturizers do. I&#x27;m 50 and I really appreciated the way in which it changed the quality and appearance of my (already quite good) skin. I can&#x27;t say for sure that it minimizes wrinkles, but it definitely seems to help by regulating dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noted, it is surprisingly not scented. I count this as a very good thing as the last thing I want is something intensely perfumey on my face.</li>
    <li> Really good products&lt;br /&gt;We look can be well used for skin care</li>
    <li> I have been using Rosewater as the third part of my patchouli and distilled, fragrance-free hazel witch topical spray - it&#x27;s pretty all purpose: aftershave, skin refresher, and just a hippy good scent (lol). And now I have switched from the rosewater to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I had with the rosewater was that just a tad too much in my mixture had me smelling like a rose arbor (just right, and it helped accentuate the patchouli, but it has been hard to hit that point). This rosehip oil is neutral in smell, and furthermore it makes a good carrier oil for the patchouli component. Add in the even more concentrated, great topical benefits that rosewater itself gave me, and this &amp;#34;discovery&amp;#34; of rosehip oil (I have always used Jojoba) is a five win for me, and certainly one to try yourself. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I received this as a complimentary review oil with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best. I am a life long herbal supplement taker and lover of incense/essential oils of all national origins, styles, and scents with strong interests both in the medicinal traditions and modern pharmacological aspects of Earth&#x27;s Natural Bounties.</li>
    <li> I can hardly believe my eyes!  I’m so thankful to have had the opportunity to try this product at a discounted price for purposes of an unbiased evaluation and review, otherwise I probably wouldn’t have gotten it.  Turns out, I’m not only thrilled with the product but, if things continue to go well, I’ll be back to purchase at full price without hesitation when my current bottle needs replacement.  Let me explain…….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wasted a lot money on so many products over the years, including multiple products from dermatologists, trying to reduce the redness in my face caused by rosacea.  My skin is very sensitive so I cautiously applied this oil to just one half of my face and practically held breath, hoping I’d not have a bad reaction to it.  I went about my business for only 5 minutes or so, then thought I’d better go look in the mirror to see if I needed to wash it off.  To my surprise, the half of my face was less red than the other.  It was not dramatic, but without question, easily noticeable.  I thought surely I must be mistaken!  Perhaps it was just the lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, before applying the oil to the other half of my face, I got very close to the mirror, taking note of what seemed to me like a gazillion noticeable capillaries all over my cheek area.  Of course, I’m exaggerating, but that is the feeling when I look closely.  Very disheartening.  Truly, there were many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling confident that I’d paid much more careful attention in order to be sure I wasn’t just imagining things if there was a change again, I applied the oil and waited again.  There is absolutely no question whatsoever, within minutes, there was a reduction in the redness of the area and amount of noticeable capillaries.  I definitely regret not have taken close-up before and after photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, that said, I admit this is my very first experience with this oil and it’s been only one day now.  But I’m just so darn excited that I might have finally found something that is going to help I couldn’t wait to write this review.  I am hoping, praying even, that I continue to have these results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally just paused before submitting this review to go check my face one more time.  I’m almost in tears of joy and that is the absolute truth.  I take pride in the integrity of any review I write and I had to be double-sure that what I’ve written here is correct.  I still can hardly believe it.  I’m truly shocked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - OK, so it&#x27;s been almost two weeks and I&#x27;m using this product daily and still loving it.  It has not made my face break out at all, which is especially awesome.  Today, I&#x27;m adding a photo taken this morning. I tried my best to get similar positioning / lighting. It does *not* do justice to the difference the oil makes, but I&#x27;m hoping you can still see the difference between the capillaries on the left side (before I applied the oil) and the reduction of appearance on right side (about 5 minutes after.)  It looks more dramatic in person, especially because the very pink skin also changes to a more normal shade.  This improvements lasts for many hours.  Pretty much all day.ing to help I couldn’t wait to write this review.  I am hoping, praying even, that I continue to have these results.

    <li> I have to say that this is truly amazing oil. I found out that it works wonders on scars so I tried it on the scar on tummy, which has been slowly healing for a while.My scar is healing faster than the other ointment or moisturizer that my doctor prescribes me. If it can heal that, then I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll heal my dry skin too. Definitely a re-purchase when I use up this bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a superb carrier oil.  It is the first carrier oil that I have come across that truly has no fragrance at all.  It is a beautifully clear oil, too.  It soaks in quickly, and really feels great on my skin.  It has done wonders for my elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The distributors, Aviano Botanicals, suggests that it be stored in a cool, dark place to preserve the quality of the organic, cold-pressed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Aviano Botanicals.</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about Rosehip  Oil and wanted to try it on my dermatitus and dry areas. I have tried it on my hands and the dry patches  are not  white but smooth to the touch. My husband has real bad dry skin on his head so he shaved it all off and has started putting the oil on it and it is making it smooth and healthy looking and this is after just a few days of use. I received this at a promo price and the review is 100% mine. I would recommend this too anyone who has dry skin .</li>
    <li> Huge 4 oz bottle of organic rosehip oil.  Great for dry skin.  Not greasy at all and has no scent so I like to add a few drops of various essential oils.  Great for frizzy hair in humid climates.</li>
    <li> The best to rosehip oil I&#x27;ve tried yet. All of them have helped my acne prone skin, but this one just looks, smells, and feels better. Absorbs well with no greasy feel, colorless, and odorless. I will also say of this oil in general that NOTHING has worked on my acne before this. I now have ZERO pimples, not just fewer or less angry pimples, and I don&#x27;t worry about the facewash I use anymore.  It&#x27;s amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> I was having a dry skin issue on my arms near my elbows for awhile, but cleared it up with just a few applications of this rosehip oil. The oil itself is clear, with no discernable scent. It gets absorbed into the skin very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a lasting greasy residue. The top is a pump bottle style and fairly easy to push down to dispense the oil. The great thing is that it really does work. Not only did it clear up my dry skin, it also helped my heels, which were pretty dry &amp; scaly.  I like the fact that there are no other ingredients other than organic, cold pressed, pure rosehip oil. I never would of tried this if I hadn&#x27;t been given the opportunity to review it for free, but now that I have, I can see myself using it more in the future, because it really works.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that it is not in a glass bottle.</li>
    <li> good price good quality</li>
    <li> I love the idea of natural alternatives for beauty and wellness products. After reading all of the benefits of rosehip oil in an artlice, I knew I wanted to try some. I liked the Aviano rosehip oil&#x27;s packaging because it includes a pump, which makes it very easy to dispense and use. I worry a bit about putting oil directly on my face because I have combination skin and don&#x27;t want to breakout from excess oil. But unlike other oils like babyoil, the rosehip oil is light and my skin drinks it up quickly. I just use it on the driest part of my face but slather it onto my hair and nails. I like to rub a few pumps into my hands before bed to combat dryness but also aging. Our hands so out age so much and yet we neglect them. Rosehip oil is rich in the essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (or omega-6), as well as linolenic acid (or omega-3) which fight the signs of aging. It&#x27;s great for any dry skin like knees, elbows and cracked feet. I also like to target the stretchmarks and small &amp;#34;shaving wound&amp;#34; scars on my skin, which Rosehip is said to be fantastic at treating. From my nails to my skin to my hair, I love finding new uses for this huge bottle of Rosehip oil! *Discount given for unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  So far I tried it on my nails and hair.  I dont know how to explaim, my nails are now softer and stronger at the same time.  I thought this being an oil it would make my hair sticky and it doesnt.  I havent used it on my face yet so this review is only for nails and hair.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil. Comparable to others I have purchased. I have from time to time purchased one that is very pink and I do not think that one was genuine.  However, this one looks, smells and feels like genuine rosehip seed oil.  The oil is honey colored  as it should be and it is thick but not super thick and it has only a slight scent to it that is hardly detectable. It works great as a moisturizer for hair or skin.  It absorbs readily into the skin and leaves my skin feeling very soft and supple.  I have used it also for washing my face and it does a good job of that.  You just have to be careful you don&#x27;t get an oil buildup in your sink drains.  My main use is on my skin and as a carrier oil in my essential oils blends. It comes with a dropper AND a pump which is shown in the picture.  So you have your choice.  My preference is the pump.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has dry skin and eczema. Rose hip oil is great for her skin and leaves it soft. Also cuts down on the itching.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil is great for your skin! I use a little of this in my face after washing it and I&#x27;m good to go. Doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny or greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Nice lightweight high quality rosehip oil. I&#x27;ve been using rosehip oil for quite some time now and this one is just as good as the most expensive brand I&#x27;ve tried. Like the others, it absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy. I like that this brand came well packaged in a sealed box and even comes with a bonus dropper. There is a pump already connected to the bottle that makes application so much easier and quicker. If you&#x27;re in need of high quality rosehip oil this is the one to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Well, after hearing good things about rosehip seed oil I decided to order some. This isn&#x27;t SEED oil, and I didn&#x27;t really understand there is a difference until after I order it. However, with much observing, I think this still may be something good to try. I also wanted to include how SO many of these reviews come off too uniform in my opinion and now I believe many may not be genuine. I most definitely wouldn&#x27;t know for sure but at least overall, this actual product seems to be genuine which is what will ultimately matter. I do wish it were bottled in glass...  I will update my review, thank you  Not bad. It&#x27;s more of a dry oil in my opinion. I see that it allows my old cells to more quickly remove themselves (cell turnover) which would make me think skin can heal and restructure more quickly. I have applied this after my shower, before bed for a few nights. Everytime I&#x27;ve used this I wake up with a nice, healthy little glow. I&#x27;m not too crazy on how dry oil feels though but if there are true benefits than I can suck it up...literally! There is almost no smell at all, if anything it would be a clean smell. One morning in addition to the glow I did have a few clogged pores. They went away pretty fast though. I think this is pretty good stuff so far.  Will update. Would raise star if glass bottle. Plastic is a huge turn off especially with people looking for natural products who know better. Hint, hint to the seller. I bet you&#x27;d have even more sells if you were to change your bottling.</li>
    <li> I like that this oil came with both a dropper and a pump, so you have some options depending on how you will be using it.  The oil behaves like rosehip oil -- fast absorbing, not greasy, easy mixing -- but I think it may be refined.  It is in an dark bottle, so I couldn&#x27;t tell  exactly what color it was, but I put a dropper full in front of a white piece of paper and it looked clear instead of amber or golden.  And the smell is a little mediciny.  Complimentary sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> expected more from the description</li>
    <li> I just started using I like it.</li>
    <li> I am loving this Rosehip oil! Great texture, not greasy and make my skin looks radiant!  100% Pure Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, an extra-virgin, unrefined carrier oil cold pressed ... always go with Natural products, organic and no fillers! I bought a smaller rose hip oil for around $20 at my local store.. so this is a pretty amazing price</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Lol... I recently added it to my everyday regimen &amp; I put it on my whole face but really rub it on any noticeable scars I have &amp; I already see a difference it makes!!  Iv also used it on my hair which is so dry all the time &amp; it seems to be so shiny &amp; looking better!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;I was chosen to review this item for free for my 100% honest feedback &amp; I was not compensated in any way for my positive reviews!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Makes my skin feel soft. Will recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> After reading about the benefits of rosehip for the skin, I decided to get a bottle to give it a try. I love this stuff! It moisturizes well, but doesn&#x27;t make you feel like a french fry. It goes on like an oil but rubs in to almost a powdery finish. It leaves you with a little sheen, but if that bothers you you can always dust with some facial powder. I actually like the sheen it leaves; makes my skin look dewy. I also use it in my hair as well , love this stuff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve learned about Rosehip oil way back than when I went to Chile and Argentina 30 years ago! It was one of the best discoveries I made and now I can get them here with the benefit of being organic, not all oils are made the same and thus one being a cold press and odorless was a no brainer for me to order , I was offered at no charge to test and give my honest opinion. I usually use it around my fine lines on my face and lately I have been facing dry elbows and knees, so I put it to the test. My husband notice my elbows are no longer scaly and feel soft again. I already knew the oil in itself was good but this brand prove that their product is of great quality and these are me sole thoughts based on my experience with it. Does come with a pump so there is no waste or leaking. I do recommend it !</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with this product from the moment I opened it. The bottle itself is not cheap and I don&#x27;t see it cracking or leaking. The pump nozzle is removable and it comes with an actual plug and a lid so that you can seal it air tight and never have to worry about it leaking if you are traveling. The oil itself is amazing. It is so light and rubs in  quickly. I only needed one or two pumps per leg and the oil spread out evenly and smoothly. I noticed a difference right away. The bottle of Rosehip oil is going to last me forever, even with using it every day. You only need a little bit for maximum results. I will never use regular lotion again, this oil is so much better. It hydrates faster and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or sticky feeling . It rubs in smoothly and evenly and leaves my skin feeling 10 time better. I am officially addicted to this oil! received for reviewing purposes</li>
    <li> Um there&#x27;s a little problem with this rosehip oil, it isn&#x27;t anything like any other rosehip oil I&#x27;ve ever seen before. It is frankly just like some neutral massage oils I&#x27;ve used. If I were buying massage oil, I would be super happy - this is a good one. But I&#x27;m buying rosehip oil, cold pressed and unrefined. Not sure how they pressed rosehips and got a perfectly clear liquid without processing. I also don&#x27;t know how they ended up with odorless oil - rosehips do smell like roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is clear and in a clear plastic pump bottle. The oil goes on nicely and moisturizes my skin. It rubs in wonderfully. It is an excellent carrier for essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strangeness of the oil bothered me, so I wrote to the company asking if this was some kind of specially processed rosehip oil. I never heard back. It has been a couple of weeks, so I guess they don&#x27;t know why it is an oil and not rosehips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.</li>
    <li> I was given this product free for review  and was  surprised how well it actually works. It&#x27;s not greasy,  and has a pleasant&lt;br /&gt;smell. I have only used it for a few days and have already felt a tightening in my skin and a nice sheen to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to continue use no this to see how well things continue. I would definitely recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil is said to have many, many uses. A friend of mine is an essential oils expert and is constantly recommending various oils to me based off of whatever issues I may be having with my skin or body. Rosehip oil was recommended to me for my stretchmarks and dark spots on my face as I recently had a baby. I will say that the rosehip oil has faded my stretchmarks immensely! The dark spots on my face aren&#x27;t as dark as they were and I also add it to my conditioner for added benefits as well. The packaging was great and the product was as described. Shipping was fast as well!! I purchased the rosehip oil to review during a promotional period and any opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing, it smells amazing and comes in a large bottle with a perfect little serum dropper! Makes it so much easier to apply and  the oil has left my skin glowing. I wore it to bed and woke up to some seriously hydrated skin. Its like some great hydration for your skin I think because of how thick the oil is. It has also repaired some sun spots that were not going away!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously any women who want to get rid of sun spots and repair some damaged skin ( I have acne scarring on my chin and jaw area) - This is the oil for you to be using. Try it out and you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent brand and quality!</li>
    <li> I just started using this oil and I like it., doesn&#x27;t have smell at all. feels smooth and good when I put it on my face.</li>
    <li> I liked that this oil comes with both a dropper and pump. It is convenient to have options to dispense the oil. The oil itself is clear which was slightly confusing because i have ordered other brands of rose hip oil that has more of a golden color. The oil itself is odorless. i used this oil along with sea salt and peppermint essential oil to make a foot scrub. It worked pretty well and was fairly hydrating. I also used it plain as a ,moisturizer on my face before bed. I didn&#x27;t have any negative reactions to this oil and overall it worked fairly well for moisturizing my skin. I received this oil free for review purposes. All opinions are honest and my own</li>
    <li> 100% Pure Rosehip Oil ORGANIC - Ultra Premium Essential Rosehip Seed Oil - Huge 4oz Bottle - Cold Pressed Unrefined &amp; Undiluted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time trying Essential Rosehip Seed Oil.  I have always been a little leery of essential oils well anything with oil in the name because I do not like an oily feeling on my skin.  I have two very pronounced scars that after 10 years still give me a fit with drying out and cracking.  I have been applying this oil daily now and I can tell a difference.  My skin is not oily but soft and smooth. I can see a difference in the cracked skin around my scar it is going away and not itchy and painful like it has been.  I am excited to try this oil in other spots. I have also begun placing on my nails as they tend to crack and are very brittle.  I can see a change in them.  They are not as dry looking as they once were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil comes in a convenient bottle with a pump dispenser.  That makes it so much easier to handle.  It ensures you do not get too much at one time. A little goes a long way with this oil.  When I saw the bottle was only a 4 oz. I was a little skeptical it did not seem like much but after using it for several days I can barely tell I have put a dent in the bottle but I have used it all over my body. I even used it in my hair to soften up my hair.  You only need a needle size drop to do a large area.  It is really great amount of bang for your buck.  The oil has no odor at all. I liked I am not a fan or strong fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have scars you want to help diminish the look of, brittle nails, dry damaged hair or sky I highly recommend giving this oil a try. You will see a difference after a few applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: This product was provided by Aviano Botanicals for review and feedback.

    <li> I have used coconut oil on my hair skin and nails for quite some time now and have thought about maybe trying something new, then this was offered to me during a promotion and I thought what the heck, I will give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;It came very quickly and was sealed much better than any other oils I have received&lt;br /&gt;It has no scent at all which surprised me, I was expecting a rose scent?&lt;br /&gt;I applied this all over when I got out of the shower and it soaked in very quickly with no greasy feeling at all. It did not bother the sensitive skin on my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;I even spray alittle in my mouse before spreading it into my hair and I love the way my hair feels.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitly  be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> This product arrived sooner than expected and is in a rather large container for the price. This product is organic, and compared to other essential oils the quantity is outrageously large! I began using it last night and am excited to see the results soon. I love the way this oil feels on my skin. I purchased this oil for a promotion, but once I&#x27;m through my first bottle I&#x27;ll be ordering my next. I&#x27;m leaving to visit family this weekend, and I&#x27;ll be bringing and sharing my oil w/the ladies of my family which I&#x27;m sure will love it also!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this Rosehip oil. I needed something for my dry face that also has a tends to be oily too. (t-zone) This was a perfect match for me, my face absorb all of it in without that oily feeling. I have also found it to very useful with diluting my essential oils. I like the packaging with the pump, it measure it out instead of pouring it out.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect carrier oil to turn to for many of my homemade products. It&#x27;s such a versatile product that I can use in my soaps, body lotions, creams for my face... I can count on it to help protect my skin from aging, dryness, scars... whatever &#x27;problem&#x27; I need to address, it seems rosehip is the oil to add.&lt;br /&gt;Having the pump on top also makes this so much easier to use and access. I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting everything all over the bottle. If my hands are a mess from mixing up &#x27;concoctions&#x27;, I can simply use a one finger pump or the back of my hand and don&#x27;t have to stop midstream to clean my hands to add it.&lt;br /&gt;It makes so much sense, too. Rosehip is full of anti-oxidants and vitamins that are really beneficial to the skin. It also works great for your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually going to try making my own lotion for sun protection this year, using rosehip. It&#x27;s known to help with sun damage so I&#x27;m going to add it in, of course, it&#x27;s already in my moisturizer for daily use so it&#x27;ll be one more shot of my &#x27;secret&#x27; skin-saving ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;This company was a new one for me.I made sure that, when this was offered for review, I checked the company out and how they made and processed their oils before signing up to review it. High quality oils are very important in making products. You don&#x27;t want just any oil in the products you&#x27;re using on your body. My skin is very sensitive so I&#x27;m always conscious of what I use, how it&#x27;s used, processed, stored... and this is a very &#x27;pure&#x27; oil so no worries using it. The company is very impressive so I can add them to my short list of go-to companies for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to use this and to find more ways to use it.&lt;br /&gt;My family does what we call an &amp;#34;Ole Time Country Christmas&amp;#34;. There&#x27;s just too many of us to buy for so, this way, everyone can get a gift and we&#x27;re still saving a ton of money. The best part though is we get a special gift that has their time and love in it. The rules for our gifts are simple: all gifts must be homemade or handmade, or you can do fruits and nuts, just like the Christmas gifts from years before when families lived off the land and provided for thwir families the best they could. Even the little kids are wanting to get involved now. (We buy for 12 and under).&lt;br /&gt;Its safe to say that this rosehip oil is going to be a key ingredient in many of the products they&#x27;ll be getting this year and will be changing the way I&#x27;ve made many of my products.&lt;br /&gt;My goal is to try to return to all natural products for everything around the home that I can. I&#x27;m tired of chemicals and additives in everything we buy, whether it&#x27;s our food, cleaners, body products or whatever. It&#x27;s a slow death and introduction of way too many life altering additives into our systems.</li>
    <li> I jumped at this oil right away when I saw it, lotion does not help my dry patches on my skin. When I received it I started using it on my elbows , ankles and knees. It helped relieve the serious dry patches I have. For years I&#x27;ve had issues with my ankles it was really nice to finally be able to touch my ankle and not feel like I was touching a gator. Seller was awesome! I received this with a discount for my unbiased honest opinion. Bottom line would I reccomended this to a friend? Yup I would.</li>
    <li> Everyone in my house uses this Rosehip oil. I have stretch marks and wrinkles I rub down every night. It has a convenient pump that controls how much you use.  My daughters have dry scaly skin at times due to this weather and use this oil for a moisturizer. It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t lead to more acne. This was a large bottle more than I expected and will last awhile. Smelled very pleasant. It was a yellow greenish color. I keep this Rosehip oil at the front of my oils because it can be used for so many things. I was able to buy this product during a promotion and am happy to share my experience with it.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil is an incredibly versatile product that can be used as an acne treatment, facial toner, daily moisturizer, scar/blemish treatment, and makeup remover, to name a few. A huge benefit of using this particular product is that this seller offers a very generous size (4 ounces) for the price, so I can use it liberally and experiment with the countless ways to apply it.  I had never heard of rosehip oil until my sister introduced me to it when she purchased a bottle for herself after claiming that Miranda Kerr swears by it. Not one to ever turn down potentially looking like Miranda Kerr, I began looking into rosehip oil as well in hopes that it would improve my acne-prone skin. I was initially wary of it since I have combination, acne-prone skin that gets oily throughout the day, and knowing that oil is often the cause of my acne, I was hesitant to put even more oil on my already sensitive skin.  This rosehip oil was surprisingly not greasy as I expected it to be. It reminds me of tea tree oil, if you have ever used that. The product is far from greasy and is easily absorbent upon application. I have been consistently applying this product to an acne scar on the side of my face, and although it has only been a few days, the scar is noticeably beginning to fade away. As I mentioned, the generous size of this product allows me to use it liberally, such that I have even started using it as an all-over serum rather than just a spot treatment. Overall, very impressed with this product, its many uses, and its overall effectiveness.  Sample provided for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.</li>
    <li> Im younger and younger.. Bcuz this item</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this product is 100% organic. It said it helps with wrinkles. I looked up the benefits of rose hip oil and it said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For facial skin care, rose hip oil offers several benefits when applied externally due to its primary constituents: essential fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin C and B-carotene, a form of vitamin A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using it.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my nails and skin for a little over a week and I am very happy with it. My nails are much shinier and looks and feel healthier. I would recommend this to everyone I come in contact with.</li>
    <li> So far...So good after a week of use on face for dry-blotchy skin. Not greasy and absorbs well into skin. Mix with a little coconut oil for night application.</li>
    <li> I think the pure rosehip oil should have amber color. But this one is clear and smelled like medication a bit. I don&#x27;t think it is pure rosehip oil. It absorbed to the skin so fast but I havent seen differences after using it like another brand did.   Updated! --- I have asked the seller if this one is pure rosehip oil cuz of the color of it. She said the seed actually is bright beigh color. Anyway, it didnt work well on my skin but it might help other types of skin. The seller replied so fast and she was helpful.</li>
    <li> i got this  few days ago and i bought this for my hair. i tried it in my hair also in my skin oh boy it was amazing really its moisturized my skin and helps my dry hair to be healthy again. i applied this to my knees elbows and my face  i love it than my normal lotion because its not sticky at all and good thing about this product its organic and fragrance free.the bottle comes with sprayer and pump you can choose which is more comfortable to you i used the pump. i am loving this product its really great for my skin and my hair specially.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Any opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
    <li> This is one of the oil that I love. Not only good for your skin but also for your hair. It can be use also for other skin problem.</li>
    <li> love this product only received it 2 days ago and I see a difference already.been using it on a rash I have and it is getting smaller .would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This oil is great for hair,nails,skin and acne scars. I have combination skin and I have some old acne scars I only apply this oil on my face in the morning after I wash my face. I first noticed a difference after a week and a half of using this oil my acne scars were less noticeable. This oil is light it gets absorbed into the skin very fast and it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling or oily look I would definitely recommend it.</li>

    <li> The product is a good product to recommend.&lt;br /&gt;After even just want to buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about 2 weeks now on my face neck &amp; chest and hair (not the hair on my chest LOL) . although it has not been a miracle product it does moisturize well and has a very light scent that is not unpleasing and not too oily.&lt;br /&gt;one of the first days  I put this on my face after the shower in the morning before work and a little got in the hair around my face and it looked a little oily all day. I now use it at night. This is a good sized bottle and should last a while</li>
