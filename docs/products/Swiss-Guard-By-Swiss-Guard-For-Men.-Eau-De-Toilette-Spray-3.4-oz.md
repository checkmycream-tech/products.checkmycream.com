<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> IT SMELLS VERY BAD, I THINK THAT THIS PERFUM MUST DESAPEAR OF THE WORLD!!! IT IS HORRIBLE PERFUM I DON&#x27;T RECOMEND THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> Bottle is disintegrating and leaving black oooze on your hands. Never seen cologne do this before. Scent smells like a mixture of window cleaner and pine floor cleaner! Terrible item. It&#x27;s almost if what I received is fake but I think the other reviewers are fake to make this cheap cologne sell.</li>
    <li> excelente vendedor y producto llego en perfecto estado a venezuela</li>
    <li> My second bottle. Lasting scenting. Very masculine. You can&#x27;t go wrong trust me.</li>
    <li> This product was losing fluid when delivered, this fluid loss ruined the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;A shame, the scent is pleasant feeling.</li>
    <li> This perfume has a very decent smell. I use it whenever I am going to college in the morning. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Swiss Guard is afresh masculine scent, with relatively long staying power. While not nearly the most expensive fragrance out there, it smells like it should cost mre than it does. Clean, but not overpowering. Good for everyday use, as well as eveinings out with that special someone.</li>
    <li> Good seller and product</li>
    <li> This is not my kind of perfume</li>
    <li> Wonderfull i love this model</li>
    <li> I caught this product on sale and it is somewhat pleasant smelling.  Yet, the bottle is leaked and for the sale price of $9.99 I thought it would be worth it due to the ratings.  If the product cannot be contained, what is the point of it?  The bottle design dictates that the bottle must stand upright at all times or you will have a mess.  I do not recommend as there are millions of other cologne companies that want your money, why waste on faulty product designs?</li>
    <li> Presents product spillage during delivery and while being applied, the container loses its color and paint remains in the hands, this has happened on both occasions I have purchased the product</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! Good fragrance...</li>
    <li> good price for days working</li>
    <li> excelente producto,llego en perfectas condiciones, responsables, la entrega se realizo en el lapso estimado de fecha de entrega, lo recomiendo absolutamente.</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent, Nice fragrance. Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap. If you are looking for perfume under $20, this one is the best.Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I like the smell and even more importantly, so does my wife. Good price.</li>
    <li> Not particularly my kind of scent. Smalls soapy. Nice enough, but wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice fragrance. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Todo muy bien. Me gusto... Fue lo que pedi... llego a tiempo... Excelente, recomendando 100%...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saludos desde Valencia - Venezuela...</li>
    <li> Great cologne for an awesome price..highly recommended! This cologne is great for the special night out, or for day to day activities. For this price, you will not get a better quality cologne.</li>
    <li> fake one did not last one week and all rvaporated mean the smell and just liquid stayed inside like alcohole</li>
    <li> I highly recommend excellent product, I am satisfied with the same quality product.</li>
    <li> Soft scent.  Wish it had more of an aroma and longer lasting time.  Feels like it disappeared shortly after applying it.</li>
    <li> My openion, Smells no good and the bottle nice but does not spray. I think it is not an original swiss guard because the mechanism of the spray. Frankly it smells like a sewer to me, I will never buy perfumes online. I have to be in the store smelling the testers.</li>
    <li> First time I bought this one and that too 3 pieces. Its an awesome product. Nice fragrance. I recommend it</li>
    <li> I had to wait more than a week product to be delivered. When I opened the box  I could see that scent was spilled over the container. container losses paint and remains in hand . With respect to quality of fragrance it&#x27;s just same as water, waste of money .</li>
    <li> Swiss Guard has a clean smelling fragrance that&#x27;s not overpowering. O.K. day or evening.</li>
    <li> It has a very good smell, received in very good packaging the first time I ordered, but the product somehow leaked in the package the second time I ordered :(.</li>
    <li> The woman really Love this stuff so I&#x27;m in need of more!</li>
    <li> A fragance perfect for work day. I&#x27;d buy it again absolutely</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have received from amazon. The seal of the bottle was broken and leaked, the bottle did not appear new.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to guess, I would said the product was defective and later sold. Believe the poor reviews!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon customer service on the other hand, was great. They offered a replacement bottle of cologe or a refund. I chose the refund.</li>
    <li> poorly sealed and the colony came almost empty</li>
    <li> For the price I found out this cologne smells as it were of a higher or more expensive quality. My wife loves it too.</li>
    <li> Even better than expected</li>
    <li> Swiss Guard is sweet and spicy, with strong notes of lavender.  Do not let the lavender notes throw you off, though, it is still a masculine scent that is not overly sweet.  It is a fantastic summer scent!  The best part is that it lasts an extremely long time, it would be a good clubbing scent.  The only downside is that the scent does not develop: it smells virtually the same from the initial spray until it wears off.  I enjoy it a lot and it is a good value for the price Amazon has it for!</li>
    <li> I was seaching for a cologne for my kids, i just love this one but is more for adults than for kids, but it&#x27;s a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended...</li>
    <li> The smell does not vydelyaetsya. You can use every day, but I did not really nothing Founded in it. Standard, not sweet at first bluff. Standard men&#x27;s scent is not a youth.</li>
    <li> Great smalling item to refresh after morning shower or washup you put than you on something smalling truly nice and wonderful an great that last the entired day even went you sweat.</li>
    <li> Yummmmy fragrance! Love it when hubby wears it! Great Price!!!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend wore this one day randomly and I fell in love... Let&#x27;s just say...I had an Axe commercial girl moment... any who, he finally told me what it was and I loved it so much I had to buy him another one. The price is great for the smell. I didn&#x27;t think it would be so cheap but hey! No complains haha. So yes, I definitely recommend it to you men, and ladies if you&#x27;re looking to buy for your man. Great smell!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like air fresher!</li>
    <li> My wife commented on how good this smelled. She thought is was the one she got me..  5 stars for wife approval. :-)</li>
    <li> I liked the product was what I expected and very good quality to recommend them all very good product when I can come back to buy</li>
    <li> This was I was looking for</li>
    <li> the item is pretty good have good condition and is completly new, and is a too good fragance. eau de toilette</li>
    <li> EL PRODUCTO LLEGO A TIEMPO COMO TODO LO QUE HE COMPRADO A TRAVÉS DE ESTE SITIO, LA ESCENCIA ES MUY BUENA Y A MUY BUEN PRECIO.   LA RECOMIENDO PARA UN REGALO O PARA USO PERSONAL.</li>
    <li> The only &amp;#34;downside&amp;#34; is that it is mildly potent (which can be a good thing for many). I started using it for work without telling anyone. A woman noticed when she was very close to me while taking a picture. At another time, when I went past a coworker she noticed it and in both occasions they said it smelled really good. Potency varies with different people but what it doesn&#x27;t changes is that it is a great scent.</li>
    <li> Worth to buy and it&#x27;s cheaper as well</li>
    <li> Nice scent and good value for a quick throw on situation.</li>
    <li> I decided to wear the cologne after 4 months, after being in my drawer. I got so many compliments from the first day I used it. What else can I say...only that you will love it and won&#x27;t regret buying it!</li>
    <li> great product for the price, very happy overall.  smells good and ships quickly would def recommend to young males who want to smell nice</li>
    <li> The price is much lower than in fragrance stores. It is exactly the same original Swiss Guard that I normally purchase. I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT HAS A NICE SCENT AND IT SEEMS TO DISAPPEAR AFTER A FEW MINUTES I HAVE BOUGHT OTHER COLOGNES FROM AMAZON AND THE SCENT LASTED ALONG TIME.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT..THE PRICE IS THE BEST</li>
    <li> Swiss Guard By Swiss Guard For Men very good excellent</li>
    <li> Fantastic lavender fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap. My husband use it diary. It´s a very good perfume under $15. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Scent is ok, but it fades away quickly: put it on when I leave home for work, by 10am you wouldn&#x27;t know I had cologne on!</li>
    <li> Im not sure if this is discontuined or the bottle I got was just old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the bottle I noticed that the black tint on the outside was flaking off and the sticker logo was ready to come off.  This indicates that the bottle was exposed to moisture and/or extreme heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had this for a few years but the smell smelled like alochol.  Im not sure if it was just my bottle but it is not how I remember at all</li>
    <li> excellent product, fit this classification because it seems a good product and I definitely recommend it to other people .....</li>
    <li> A strong, masculine scent that is not overwhelming.  This spray provides a rugged scent which is great for all generations.</li>
    <li> good afternoon, I welcome the responsibility and product quality, really very satisfied, even though the purchase was being in another country was reliable miy</li>
    <li> Nothing to say just perfect!</li>
    <li> Very good, but not magic as described in some reviews.</li>
    <li> The fragrance it is exquisite and it is smells very masculine.&lt;br /&gt;Ideal for gift!&lt;br /&gt;The package of delivery it is ideal size.&lt;br /&gt;My rating is five stars is:&lt;br /&gt;1-Product Quality&lt;br /&gt;2-Shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;3-Time Delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> excelente producto recomendado</li>
    <li> I have to say...this is a nice cologne with a lovely smells...for daily use..you can&#x27;t ask for more...as well great price.  I do recommend it...just try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already bought this cologne twice and will get it again. What a deal!</li>
    <li> I give for somebody like a gift and she loved it.</li>
    <li> excellent product I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> I was SCAMMED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product initially showed, was not the same I paid for.</li>
    <li> Very Good perfume at this price. I bought is for gift purpose and everyone liked it. 10$ is very cheap price</li>
    <li> Love this smell, and it really smells great on me so says the people in my life.&lt;br /&gt;also its not so pricey easy to afford ,  since its not to bad, of a price you also get a big bottle for a great price&lt;br /&gt;love this cologne.</li>
    <li> This bottle when i opened was leaking and has destroyed all the labels and the box itself.&lt;br /&gt;So before you buy a perfume just note you cannot return it back and your money is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.

    <li> i can not used my cologne, the problem was the accesorie where i push the spray... :( i do not like this item! i would like to return this item, that is not good!!!</li>
    <li> excelent 100% + + + + +</li>
    <li> Excellent fresh fragrance for daily use I recommend it to look good in any casual situation. good buy</li>
    <li> I ordered the perfume and the bottle was delivered on time but the bottle was leaking. the bottle was leaking right under the cap and makes me not sure if the perfume is original and not just a diluted refilled knock off..&lt;br /&gt;buyer beware !!</li>
    <li> It stinks a bit, but after it is on for a while it levels off to a pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> Good afternoon. PRODUCT LIKE IT IS ORIGINAL, SMELL GOOD, THE USE FROM 03 YEARS AGO. I USED AND OTHER ALLERGIES CAUSING ME. THANKS I AM UNDER</li>
    <li> The bitches admire this fragrance thoroughly. I highly recommend this is you enjoy getting mad bitches everywhere you go.</li>
    <li> The perfume is all you can expect, it&#x27;s so intense that could be unconfortable in the beggining, it came perfectly sealed (the box) but the bottle has a little leakage that cause the paint of the bottle had a damage, reason why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I v just  got my order and I found all three leaking and look measurable , I really shocked  how can I send this as gift and I order a lots of thing  from Amazon why this happen to me I wish I can send picture to you to see how they look . how can you solve this problem pleas.............</li>
    <li> When I got the bottle I noticed that the black tint on the outside was flaking off.</li>
    <li> For the price I feel like I should give it 3 stars, but the smell wasn&#x27;t awesome compared to the other ones out there....I mean, it&#x27;s OK. I wear it for day to day and before gym. But my poor rating is mainly because of the freaking pump....it doesn&#x27;t always work, I have to keep pressing it. Maybe it&#x27;s the problem with the one I have. For me, it&#x27;s one of those you will buy because it&#x27;s cheap and move on to try different other ones out there.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing cologne. It shipped fairly fast and  the only problem I had was the fact that the bottle seemed to leak a little and the label peeled off. It has a soft yet masculine scent, perfect for younger boys. The scent lasts about 4 hours and the bottle lasts about 8 months. Overall I was satisfied.</li>
    <li> smells nice . good price</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, it&#x27;s really good for the price and smells great. Good for everyday use. I&#x27;m sure it will make a good gift. I will recommend this to anyone. It arrived as planned. No problem with this item.</li>
    <li> The price is ok, the content ok....but the bottle is the worst quality, the outside tag of this is destroying.</li>
    <li> Nice very acceptable I would buy this product again</li>
    <li> smell nice good ////////////////&lt;br /&gt;tastey smooth good smell just the right smell not too much for price is cool smill</li>
    <li> Exquisite fragrance for men, its aroma is citrusy and woodsy at the same time, fresh and very durable taps on the skin.</li>
    <li> One of the best perfume I have used so far. Not too overpowering but at the same time has a nice overall feel for the entire day.</li>
    <li> I like this because its price and durable parfum!</li>
    <li> It is good with mild smell, but it won&#x27;t last for long time.</li>
    <li> The bottle of cologne came damaged. Around half of the bottle was empty, but the cologne smells great.</li>
    <li> This product has a good scent to it also the scent last longer than I expected. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is fake.The bottle when you hold it leaves a black residue all over your hands which caused me to dirty my shirt.They should have mentioned that it was not authentic .</li>
    <li> Great scent and at a fantastic price so it is affordable . I like the spray mist dispensing and having several scents depending on the day and mood . This is a winner . I really like it . Been using some of the body sprays from Old Spice too . Amazon has some great deals right now must be a new year coming up and leftover stock after Christmas .</li>
    <li> buy this product because I wanted to surprise my family with Christmas gift turned out to be good fragrance and lasting</li>
    <li> It was I imagined.! It´s perfect!!</li>
    <li> Excelent fragancy and quality product.</li>
    <li> smells very good. it looks and feels very modern, i got it for my nephew and he likes it a lot.!</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived on time, this fragrance is a classic and I&#x27;ve used it before, and smells just as I remember it, I am satisfied with this purchase, I recommend it for the one who seeks a classic scent</li>
    <li> an excellent smell, very good price</li>
    <li> The product came broken.</li>
    <li> It smells awesomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.</li>
    <li> bottle is dangours my perfume bottle is leacked and outside the black color stick my hand that bottel garbage Waste of money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very pleasant smell but it is a little too reminiscent of &amp;#34;carpet fresh&amp;#34; for my liking.  I use it after a shower or before bed just to smell something nice but by no means is this a signature fragrance for me.</li>
    <li> Very good product, i loved it looking forward to order again as soon as i finish the present one which i am using.</li>
    <li> Does not last long even an hour. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Faster shipping, excellent product, I am very happy with the Swiss Guard, pleasant scent for daily use</li>
    <li> lo unico fue que este perfume llego con la tapa averiada y por ende se derramo liquido, ya es la seunda vez que nos pasa.</li>
    <li> very good I recommend it</li>
    <li> Got this product today. Smells good and authentic BUT it spill during delivery and being applied. Also the container loses its color. That&#x27;s why two stars.</li>
    <li> all very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> AWESOME bitter scent, love it, sticks with you, spray it on body and shirt....long lasting in my opinion</li>
    <li> spread it,open. Part is lost and the exterior paint is left.</li>
    <li> Nice aroma, good price, recommend</li>
    <li> Two words: spicy lavender. But a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; spicy lavender (whatever that means). Also, don&#x27;t be thrown off by the sticker price. Yes, it&#x27;s super cheap, but it&#x27;s some good cheap stuff (that doesn&#x27;t actually smell cheap). This is like a poor man&#x27;s Swiss Army Classic or Davidoff Cool Water. But slightly more soapy &amp; powdery-smelling. Wear this for when it&#x27;s hot outside. No base notes or middle notes or  anything like that though. What you smell after the first spray is what you&#x27;re going to get for the rest of the day. Whether that&#x27;s a good or bad thing is up to you. The scent lasts, maybe, on a good day, 4-6 hours. Take this to the gym. Or the yacht. Whatever.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this spray after a nice shower.</li>
    <li> i bought this for myself, i really like this perfume  but it is not like a swiss army i bought 2 years ago   this one it is like less strong but still the aroma comes out in a smooth way   it lasts even when you wash the clothing it keeps its essence</li>
    <li> Awesome scent for the price, I use it often</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Subtle but lasts for hours and hours. Sandalwood, citrus. just amazing smell. I Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its a good cologne, I like it. Was recived on time....all fine</li>
    <li> Buenas Noches quiero informar que este producto llego roto y casi vacio...</li>
    <li> The perfume box is useless. The perfume is shed on inside the box</li>
    <li> Excellent smell, even though it was leaking when I got it.</li>
    <li> smelled good  fast shipping</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read that it smells similar cool water, which I love. The only thing they have in common is the lavender. Take cool water, remove the tart opening and fresh/aquatic base, add powder and you&#x27;ve got Swiss Guard.&lt;br /&gt;This smells exactly like Febreze lavender air freshener.  Very cheap smelling and I already had low expectations given the price.</li>
    <li> I actually love this fragrance. its manly like smell comes on as well and it last all day long. I tried this cologne the first day I got it, and I was surprised how long the fragrance lasted . after a shower at the end of a 10 hour day I could still smell a light hint of it. this is good stuff it works well as an everyday fragrance if you feel you like something with a little more volume to it..get this it&#x27;s turned up a bit. ;))</li>
    <li> I would recommend this cologne to anyone, except if i see you often and have to smell you walking around with my unique fragrance,&lt;br /&gt;lol.</li>
    <li> Awful and cheap smelling with notes of windex/cleaner</li>
    <li> I love the scent, and haven&#x27;t had any issues with the bottle leaking, not working, etc, like some of the other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I do have to take two stars off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It simply doesn&#x27;t last!  The scent is gone in a maximum of a few hours, you can forget about it lasting a whole day.</li>
    <li> Perfume de especial aroma para uso diario. Recomendable para cualquier ocasión. Buen precio. Originalidad confiable. Entrega a tiempo según plan de envío seleccionado</li>
    <li> Great fragance and great price!</li>
    <li> Great smelling and fast shipping.  Very happy</li>
    <li> Really great smelling Cologne! I plan on buying again, and if you&#x27;re considering then think no more...This is a must buy if you want a fabulous smelling fragrance.</li>
    <li> The scent is fine and I really like it but the bottle leaked. The paint on the bottle than \\&quot;melted\\&quot;. People need to know that and take care where they put the bottle if need to move with it.</li>
    <li> Excelente relacion precio vs calidad. Recibi en muy buen estado. Estoy conforme con el mismo, y por tanto, he recomendado a mis amigos.</li>
    <li> perfume came with broken security, so I spilled.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed first time it happens to me.&lt;br /&gt;the package arrived in good condition, but inside everything was impaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*perfume llegó con seguridad roto, por lo que se derramó.&lt;br /&gt;Estoy decepcionado primera vez que me pasa a mí.&lt;br /&gt;el paquete llegó en buenas condiciones, pero por dentro todo estaba deteriorada.</li>
    <li> She loves it. Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Good product! is perfect, i like it</li>
    <li> The smell is good but the bottle is i think spolit or damage the logo on the glass is erased</li>
    <li> What can I say,  this cologne is bangin! It&#x27;s got a cent to it an I bet it will last.</li>
    <li> Smells good and nice not the best iv ever smelled but one of the top ones. Big bottle size for the price.</li>
    <li> buena fragancia y todo muy bien en el envio muy sastifecho con la compra... recomendado para otras ocaciones y compras</li>
    <li> Ladies have complemented this cologne</li>
    <li> Good buy long lasting , agin when your&lt;br /&gt;shirt is removed still has great smell&lt;br /&gt;  Matt</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, good product, was exactly what I ordered, arrived on schedule with no problems and works perfectly, thanks</li>
    <li> Great value; wonderful fragrance! He just loves it.  I would purchase this item over and over again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Masculine scent indeed, my son is enjoying it.  I am yet to discover the leakage other buyers mentioned in their feedback.</li>
    <li> The scent is ok but doesn&#x27;t last all that long, more of an after shave than anything else. The price is right, shipping fine, overall not a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> It is a very good perfume, a bit battered but the packaging is very good recommend and the girls love it</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing. It definitely lingers. Lavender tones, but manly. This one is the original Swiss Guard spray and for the price &amp; size you just can&#x27;t beat it. It&#x27;s worth your giving it a try. Especially if you&#x27;re looking for something for a really picky dude....</li>
    <li> excelente producto, muy buen aroma, excelente el envio, gracias por la atencion prestada ... ... . . . . .</li>
    <li> The product arrived in perfect condition,&lt;br /&gt;product quality corresponds to the specifications given on Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much</li>
    <li> It is a really awesome fragrance. I really like.it.</li>
    <li> Scent is great not too over bearing.  Cool.</li>
    <li> The scent is OK but the bottle leaked. The paint on the bottle than \\&quot;melted\\&quot;. What a mess! Do not put in suitcase or gym bag.</li>
    <li> Received the product, but the bottle leaked so the bottle was only partially full.  The liquid eroded the exterior of the bottle, so the black coating sloughed off all over the inside of the packaging.  Love the scent, but the packaging really ruined the full experience.  Will probably never purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Great!!! like it  a lot!</li>
    <li> Good product, arrived on the date indicated. Recommended 100%. excellent product. . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Colonies with lid damaged and half of the colony spilled.</li>
    <li> It does have this nice smells, I actually first though of soap, but once it is on the skin and blends out, it really smells great, I do like it and so people that I work with also like the smell, so that&#x27;s what it counts.. I will buy it again..</li>
    <li> Okay scent, but stopped spraying after only a few uses, couldnt get in touch with seller cause it was outside my purchase period.</li>
    <li> Bought this blind just based on the reviews, but when it arrived I instantly loved the scent.  This will become a staple in my rotation....really good stuff.  Cant really speak to the longevity of the scent, as of yet, but the \\&quot;one spritz\\&quot; on my arm seemed to stick around for a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might be too early to call, but I think this cologne would work as a summer, spring, or fall daily user...JMO</li>
    <li> Perfume original, buena fragancia que perdura todo el dia y gran presentación en el diseño del envase, ademas de economico.</li>
    <li> Para nada me gusto. Huele a perfume barato, claro......es barato. Dios mio quien me manda? Bieno que me pase. Piensenlo bien antes de comprar.</li>

    <li> Very good, it is better that I expected</li>
    <li> I have had much better</li>
    <li> Full my expectatativas with respect to the product.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my grandsons and they love it, as do i.</li>
    <li> Not a cheap smell, but a cheap price.  Good Smell.  I got this  to keep in my  vehicle  for work and stuff.  You can not beat this for 10 bux.</li>
    <li> good product, recommended !!</li>
    <li> nunca llego al distino</li>
    <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
    <li> excellent seller &amp; product</li>
    <li> Super product great smell</li>
    <li> Good cologne but getting to expensive</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for $13 at 3.4oz. Let me tell you, a great buy on my part. I get so many compliments from girls who I don&#x27;t even know. Makes me wish I would have bought this cologne sooner!</li>
    <li> I received the product today and surprised to see that outer cover is having different shades as if mixed in water. When opened the cover, i realized that only half bottle of the perfume is there in it. And all the black paint is coming out of the bottle. Even the Swiss emblem came into hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will there be a checking and review mechanism before mailing the product to customers. I never expected this sort of service from amazon. I had to wash off my hands more than couple of times for the scent as well as the color to go off. I was expecting an original product but now I am doubting whether this is an original one..</li>
    <li> This is a great scent for men. it is noticeable when wearing but not too overpowering for people around you. IT has a unique blend which delivers an intense yet airy woody scent with a hint of clover I would say.&lt;br /&gt; IT came on time and no issues with that. iT is a classic cologne that is timeless and for all ages, from young teenagers to older people.</li>
    <li> The product arrived broken.When I opened the box It was broken and wetted by the fluid. just lose my money</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift and the person receiving loved that is was Swiss Guard.. nifty gift idea.. will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume before and I bought second time again.  Even my friend liked the perfume. I definitely recommend somebus</li>
    <li> It has a really nice smell to it. It does not disappear after a while it stays the same. Shipping was right on time. I recommend people to buy it . great choice and price! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> On time I receive the item in Colombia, without damage, and good quality</li>
    <li> I had come online to order some Musk cologne and Amazon suggested Swiss Guard was popular too, so I thought that I&#x27;d try it. I am glad that it did. I love it! It&#x27;s the only cologne that I use now.</li>
    <li> I dont know why but this thing is very strong when you are close to it. Plus it&#x27;s one of those you hate it, or love it type of smells. I hated it. No one at my worked liked it either. Blah. I had given it away for free to someone that enjoyed the smell themselves. Not a good smell. :(</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Excelente 100% recomendable&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I received the one as shown in Amazon and like the fragrance... it&#x27;s refreshing!</li>
    <li> nice fragrance and very good for the price</li>
    <li> Did not like it at first but it grew on me. It is a bit musky and when it is just sprayed, it actually smells alcoholic. It is like beer, an acquired taste/scent</li>
    <li> MYUY BUEN PRODUCTO LA ENTREGA FUE RAPIDA.. GRACIAS</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent&lt;br /&gt;Nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Very masculine&lt;br /&gt;Received in very good packaging and arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;The package of delivery it is ideal size&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> great item.. i would buy again .my wife loves the smell and hates for me to wear it to work ..</li>
    <li> and I have the product in my hands. all in perfect condition .thanks</li>
    <li> is good ..exelent fraganse..and good price...l likr this for my husvand..thanks..is very very nice,,for do a present ....for the family..</li>
    <li> Bottle was broken and was literally a waste of money. Tried to return it but the system did not allow it. Will think twice buying again.</li>
    <li> So to start, the reviews about the leaks/bottle damage are true. however it is not something that should cause you to avoid this item. The sprayer top is made of plastic and i think that it leaks when it heats up and is turned upside down. The bottle damage was only cosmetic, there is black paint on the bottle which soaked up the liquid and then began to peel off. just take a wet paper towel and rub the paint off that is wet. it will only peel the damaged part. other than that it is a great product. To give you an idea of how much i lost due to the leak i would say a little less than a fifth of the bottle leaked... not that much at all you probably will get tired of the smell before you run out of spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell.... it is very masculine. HOWEVER it is almost identical to Ur by Usher. it like they just changed the bottle so don&#x27;t get both because it will be a waste of money. the only up side to Ur is the bottle is kinda cool... but back to the smell, i dont think you could go wrong with it. i can not speak to the longevity of the scent, it smells pretty strong from the bottle so i would wager that it will be on you for the better part of the day how ever it is something that you could get use to and YOU may no longer smell it but others will be able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all i think it would be a 5 star product but because of the leaking part i gave it four. i would give this as a gift to a friend... hope it helps.</li>
    <li> nice and different scent at a good price and especially like the fact that it is a spray, good all around purcase</li>
    <li> SMELLS GREAT AND LASTS LONG.</li>
    <li> Excelente Fragancia a un costo incomparable.  Duradera..  De vedad no me arrepiento de haber comprado este producto.  Lo recomiendo ampliamente.  EL envio fue impecable..  Saludos desde Venezuela</li>
    <li> Great Price, Fast Shipping, Nice Product as described.</li>
    <li> excellent purchase, the product arrived on time, which is such as described, I highly recommend</li>
    <li> it is a good Eau De ... much better than those costing four times ... it is for a manly fragrance.</li>
    <li> Swiss guard is really nice.  It&#x27;s beyond my expectation for the money I spent. Nicely packed and reached safely. /</li>
    <li> the product is very good&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend it to my friends and some family thanks hope to buy again with you bye</li>
    <li> The price it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragance and bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible I will recomend to my friends and paratentals.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance long lasting</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good perfum but the smell is too hard</li>
    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last , I will not buy it again, sorry but I try not to give bad reviews. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a mild and sweet fragrance that is wonderful and smell good. Men beware of hungry ladies while wearing this perfume.  Once again thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> this man&#x27;s perfume smell was amazing , but the iron case is a little bit bad ,the balck paint outside of the case shed easily</li>
    <li> Very good scent. and lasts long. this is my second purchase (brother took first one )  in last 6 months are quality has not degraded. ( seller:AMAZON. no third party purchase). Good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE; Everybody&#x27;s preference differs about perfume scent.</li>
    <li> This for my husband he was running out so I thought I&#x27;ll try this for him the scent is okay and he seem to like it</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance and comfortable in public</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve smelled one other Swiss Guard cologne and I did like it so when I saw the price for this product, I thought to myself why not. When it arrived I tried it out and I have to say it&#x27;s one of my new favorites! It smells very good and it lasts for quite a while! My wife likes it also! If you try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Especially for $11 and some change!</li>
    <li> The scent itself is okay; nothing special.  It is very heavy, so be warned.  The scent is very strong and makes quite the statement.  However, my biggest qualm is the bottle.  When the product arrived, the top of the bottle was peeling off (the black cover over the glass) and the cologne was everywhere.  It has since leaked in many situations.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It is exactly as I bought it</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband and he loved it.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second time with them and I will buy more</li>
    <li> Little strong, but not bad if you walk into it.</li>
    <li> I got an empty box, no perfume swiss wine Guard By Swiss Guard For Men. Why not get the product</li>
    <li> Reminds me of knockoff fragrances you get at WalMart. I am done buying these cheap fragrances and will return to the more expensive, but reliable brands.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell!! very nice pick</li>
    <li> Very nice fragance but it&#x27;s strong for me. I will give it to my dad.</li>
    <li> I smell Pimpa-licious! The chicks like me more now and I smell like beast!</li>
    <li> This cologne is very soft and not strong. Will work on any man that looks for light smell but a lasting one!</li>
    <li> excelente perfume.&lt;br /&gt;excelente producto de muy buen precio y de muy buen gusto para mi persona..se lo recomiendo a cualquier persona en el mundo..</li>
    <li> This is the best at the price.  This cologne has good expensive smell to it..&lt;br /&gt;This  cologne is  my favorite now.</li>
    <li> Ok fragrance.  Doesn&#x27;tlast lonag.</li>
    <li> good product. the packing came with some details, but every ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buen producto. el empaque llegó con algunos detalles, pero todos bien.</li>
    <li> Smells great for such a low price.</li>
    <li> Good choice. We recommend</li>
    <li> Really good value for the money you pay, lasts long, smells good. A nice everyday perfume. Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent, my son is happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent, no problems.</li>
    <li> excelente perfumen .... gracias</li>
    <li> As always love this smell by swiss guard, I have had it several times, nice smell and not a lot of $.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> Very nice humble and rich smell.</li>
    <li> Good for the price...</li>
    <li> The product was damage. The perfume arrived defective, liquid spills.</li>
    <li> Wife LOVES this cologne on me...</li>
    <li> The perfume is not coming out of the container. I&#x27;m just getting air out of it. It is just waste of money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent service. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Swiss Guard Spray has a great scent and the spray works well.  The scent has a wonderful sports kick to it and is agreeable with men and women.  But it&#x27;s only for men.  This spray lasts a long time and the price is great too.  I highly recommend this!  It&#x27;s my favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery , product in good conditions and UN &#x27;s nice and soft smell scam. We recommend</li>
    <li> excellent product, but the lid makes the product coming out.</li>
