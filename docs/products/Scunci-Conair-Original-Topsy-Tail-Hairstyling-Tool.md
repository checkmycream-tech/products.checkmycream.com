      <li>Baby fine, thick blonde hair-</li>
      <li>The directions were much easier to follow than on the other tool I ordered.  </li>

    <li> My mother and niece love this thing.  It was hard to find but not on Amazon.  Great price to.  I recommend this for other.</li>
    <li> this is exactly like the original I had growing up. the jr is a nice addition for my youngest daughter</li>
    <li> It is great to use.  Can try new hairstyles now that my hair is longer.&lt;br /&gt;Bought one for my daughter.  She loves hers also.</li>
    <li> This was purchased via the USA as I could get two for the price of one in the UK. Very happy and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had one of these during my teenager years and bought another one.  This one seems more flimsy.  I have very thick hair and its hard to work with.</li>
    <li> These Conair tipsy tails hair styling tools shipped quickly, but when I got them they appeared much smaller than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do seem to be made well enough to not fall apart when used like I have seen some reviews mention they had encountered with different brand tipsy tails.  Even though they are smaller than expected. They have worked perfectly and have been painless when I used them to styles 3 and a half year old granddaughter&#x27;s long hair.  They have also worked fine on my medium length, adult hair.  The only thing I dislike about this product is that the 3 no damage elastics, included with the 2 different sized tipsy tails,  are too dark and way too thick for me to use either in my light blond hair or my granddaughter&#x27;s light brown hair.</li>
    <li> It is just like the one I bought years ago.  Works just the same.  I have never seen a small version of it, like the one that came with this.  I love that one too.</li>
    <li> Had a hard time using this on our grand-daughter&#x27;s hair - she has thin hair.  Plus the instructions are hard to follow</li>
    <li> I have tried this on my own hair and my sisters and love it.  It does not tangle.  The directions were much easier to follow than on the other tool I ordered.  This would work well on kids and I think any grandmother that has not learned to french braid would love this tool to fix their granddaughters hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have long thick hair. It works perfectly. I love it. It brings a small and a large.</li>
    <li> strong enough for my hair hurray</li>
    <li> works great for all types of hair, creative ways to do your hair</li>

    <li> I love the Scunci Conair Topsy Tail Hairstyling Tool it makes styling mine and my daughters hair so fast. it&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s Fun for all ages.</li>
    <li> Can you say blast from the past?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one of these when I was little, in the 90&#x27;s. But now, as an adult, I have rediscovered this tool and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair, like me, it is best used on dry hair. Wet hair is much harder to pull through. But overall this tool is very tough. I use it all the time, on wet and dry hair, and it has held up for months so far!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An easy, fast way to style hair in a fresh new way. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Pretty good item. Haven&#x27;t used it very much.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid, I thought it would be a better quality. I did see others priced less than $1.00, but thought that the price would reflect a lessor quality.</li>
    <li> Baby fine, thick blonde hair- it does its job&lt;br /&gt;Course and curly dark hair- it does its job&lt;br /&gt;Black, silky and oily- did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought it, there&#x27;s no substitute to this product.  I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Best little hair tool ever!</li>
    <li> as described, fast shippping</li>
    <li> I love this styling tool!  For someone who is not talented in styling long hair this tool makes it easy.</li>
    <li> I use it just about everyday!</li>
    <li> It was just like I expected.Very satisfied.</li>
