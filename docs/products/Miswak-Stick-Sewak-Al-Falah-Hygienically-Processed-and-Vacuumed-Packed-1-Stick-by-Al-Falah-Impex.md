### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very impressive!</li>
      <li>The best investment I&#x27;ve made for my health lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can chew on this instead and do something good for your teeth!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had an epiphany about this product - people who run health blogs who reviewed this product saying it works well are paid to give it a good review!</li>
      <li>but again its great for cleaning teeth.</li>
      <li>Both flavors are good.</li>
      <li>The packaging is good, but I wish it were re-sealable like a zip-lock type of bag.  </li>
      <li>I feel as if my mouth has balance now with helping the good bacteria thrive.</li>
      <li>Nice product and best part is its available anywhere within the US.</li>
      <li>I love it though!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found an alternative to those chemically filled toothpastes that are poisonous if you swallow it.  </li>
      <li>Love good money you could spend for your health</li>
      <li>Nicely packaged.  </li>
      <li>If ur turned off by the taste (or you want to mix things up a bit) you could soak the bristles in some rose water which is really nice.</li>
      <li>Either way it&#x27;s good for your teeth :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still very healthy for you, but I ended up using Licorice Root instead.</li>
      <li>Christ then you are healthy wealthy and wise .</li>
      <li>Great product, leaves teeth feeling fresh</li>
      <li>I read a study that said using miswak in addtion to brushing worked better than just brushing or just miswak.</li>
      <li>did have to cut the end off at the end of the day as I found myself using it many times yesterday.</li>
      <li>The taste of the stick is interesting..</li>
      <li>and I will get more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also read another that said its more effctive than brushing.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect even with all the research I did</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to order more now.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love peelu brush.</li>
      <li>Also, the product came in a timely fashioned and when I opened it and used it, it was very fresh and taste nicely.</li>
      <li>It was nice and fresh.</li>
      <li>And probably have a special link or cookie that follows you so that every reader who goes and buys one gets the blogger a commission!</li>
      <li>This stick has made my mouth feel more clean than using a brush and tooth paste.</li>
      <li>Easy to carry, I keep mine in a plastic toothbrush container.</li>
      <li>I wanted something that was easy to take with me where ever I go.</li>
      <li>The piece came wrapped securely yesterday.</li>
      <li>Fantastic.  </li>
      <li>but this Miswak is naturual and free of those problems.</li>
      <li>and my teeth always feel really smooth</li>
      <li>My teeth felt smooth and clean after using it, and breath odor was neutralized.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not completely sure this is a perfect replacement for brushing with toothpaste, but it does help.  </li>
      <li>but when I use it my teeth feel as clean as they do when I leave the dentist.</li>
      <li>Nothing leaves my teeth feeling as clean as these things...</li>
      <li>teeth felt nicely clean and the taste was not horse radish which I was worried about.</li>
      <li>Leaves your teeth fresh and clean and so soft :) I think over all it does a better job than my $100 toothbrush</li>
      <li>My mouth, teeth feel so fresh and clean after using it.</li>
      <li>I gave the second stick to my mom and she loved it very much.</li>
      <li>It does in fact clean the teeth very well!</li>
      <li>I did try it, it clean teeth pretty well</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great natural product and inexpensive compared with many brands of plastic toothbrushes, so I recommend trying this miswak stick if you&#x27;re into going green with your health and beauty.</li>
      <li>If you like chewing on wooden stick and having mouth full of saw dust, then sure, go ahead.</li>
      <li>They clean your teeth really well</li>
      <li>Miswak tastes funny, but really leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
      <li>This works pretty well</li>
      <li>This is my first review.</li>
      <li>I really like these!</li>
      <li>After I brush with the miswak it leaves a much better aftertaste than a regular toothbrush.</li>
      <li>The first time I saw someone use the Peelu in North Africa,I thought it was because he could not afford a&lt;br /&gt;Western style toothbrush.</li>
      <li>They are just exactly what they are supposed to be.</li>
      <li>The first day I used it I could tell a healing process had began in my mouth.</li>
      <li>I find that it helps to rinse your mouth with warm (not hot) water before using the miswak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t be buying this particular product again because of the size, but I will be buying another miswak soon!  </li>
      <li>I will keep you posted, the best money I&#x27;ve spent on saving my teeth, gums and health lately.</li>
      <li>It really works.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>But just for something to chew on it really wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for</li>
      <li>I found one at the health food store that uses essential oils and is fluoride free.</li>
      <li>Does not even clean the teeth at all, just leaves tiny fibers in your mouth.</li>
      <li>It particularly helps with things stuck in the teeth, and it&#x27;s gentle.  </li>
      <li>Some of my teeth had became sensitive at the gum area and the first day it was gone and my teeth feel stronger.</li>
      <li>I might even introduce one to my little one when she gets some teeth of course :)</li>
      <li>From my other review of these fraudulent products: \\&quot;after reading a rave review for this product on a health blog and reading other good reviews on amazon i decided to buy one.</li>
      <li>My only problem with it is that it was much thinner than I expected it to be (expected about 3-4cm diameter, reality is more like 1.5cm), which means it takes longer to clean your teeth</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this natural brush.</li>
      <li>My tongue had a white coating for years and after the first day it was been gone.</li>
      <li>This is my first miswak and will not be the last.</li>
      <li>(perfume-y odor goes away after first or second use).</li>
      <li>It actually kept me from snacking quite as much as it gave me something in my mouth that had some flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My package arrived within 3 days or ordering and it had nicely and individually packed about at least a dozen of Miswaks.</li>
      <li>While it is a little more labor intensive than your regular plastic toothbrush, you do not have to do much work to get it to form the bristles, I chewed it for a few minutes and it was ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended and definitely I will buy it again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was still skeptical that something without an overpowering taste and aroma of mint would leave my mouth clean and fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised by this Sewak Al-Falah miswak stick.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it if you want to try a natural green product which is gentle to your teeth.</li>
      <li>The mistake was not dry at all.</li>
      <li>I was not sure what to expect, but it turned to be a very positive experience.</li>

<li> and if you use them a few times a day plaque won&#x27;t form at all on your teeth.</li>
<li> I use my stick a few times a day and at night before bed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my first review. But I bought this chew stick clam my oral fixation because I&#x27;m a smoker. I didn&#x27;t realize it was suppose to be a toothbrush. I did try it, it clean teeth pretty well but it alittle over price since last about a week. But just for something to chew on it really wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for but again its great for cleaning teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an epiphany about this product - people who run health blogs who reviewed this product saying it works well are paid to give it a good review! And probably have a special link or cookie that follows you so that every reader who goes and buys one gets the blogger a commission! From my other review of these fraudulent products: \\&quot;after reading a rave review for this product on a health blog and reading other good reviews on amazon i decided to buy one. Gotta say it&#x27;s a scam. No amount of chewing made this root form bristles. It just splintered into a chewed looking small root. While chewing, it breaks up and you constantly have to spit out small particles. There is no way for it to reach your back teeth. Save your money!! \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I would like to thank the generous seller who sent me two sticks instead of one. Very impressive! I gave the second stick to my mom and she loved it very much. Also, the product came in a timely fashioned and when I opened it and used it, it was very fresh and taste nicely. Highly recommended and definitely I will buy it again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten into green health &amp; beauty products. I was looking for something to replace my plastic toothbrush and happened upon miswak. Even after reading much on the internet about the health benefits of miswak, I was still quite skeptical and decided to buy one to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, you will notice that it has a distinctive odor and taste. You may or may not like it (I happen to like it). It smells and tastes sort of like a tasty mushroom. If you are used to cleaning your mouth exclusively with minty-flavored products the taste of miswak will be strange. While it is a little more labor intensive than your regular plastic toothbrush, you do not have to do much work to get it to form the bristles, I chewed it for a few minutes and it was ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was still skeptical that something without an overpowering taste and aroma of mint would leave my mouth clean and fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised by this Sewak Al-Falah miswak stick. It does in fact clean the teeth very well! The front teeth are easiest, the back teeth can be a little hard to reach but eventually I got the hang of using it. When using a regular plastic toothbrush my gums always bleed, but this miswak stick did not make my gums bleed at all. My teeth felt smooth and clean after using it, and breath odor was neutralized. I find that it helps to rinse your mouth with warm (not hot) water before using the miswak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Also, the package doesn&#x27;t specify this but you should rinse it off well after each use and trim the bristles a bit with scissors after a few uses as well.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great natural product and inexpensive compared with many brands of plastic toothbrushes, so I recommend trying this miswak stick if you&#x27;re into going green with your health and beauty. This may sound weird, but I also would recommend it for people who like to chew on pens and pencils. You can chew on this instead and do something good for your teeth!</li>
    <li> They are just exactly what they are supposed to be. My package arrived within 3 days or ordering and it had nicely and individually packed about at least a dozen of Miswaks. I kept few for myself and gave away the rest to my friends. Tooth brush bristles are hard on your tooth enamel and damages them overtime but this Miswak is naturual and free of those problems. Highly recommend it if you want to try a natural green product which is gentle to your teeth.</li>
    <li> Fantastic.  It really works.  It tastes bad at first.  You get used to it with time</li>
    <li> The packaging is good, but I wish it were re-sealable like a zip-lock type of bag.  I have no complaints.  Miswak tastes funny, but really leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> It was very dry and does not widdle or chew down well. Maybe I just got one that was packaged wrong...</li>
    <li> I have concerns with the use of fluoride in tooth paste and was researching alternatives when I came across Miswak sticks so I decided to give it a try. I was not sure what to expect, but it turned to be a very positive experience. It&#x27;s a little hard to get used to at first but when I use it my teeth feel as clean as they do when I leave the dentist. I don&#x27;t use toothpaste anymore but I do use mouthwash. I found one at the health food store that uses essential oils and is fluoride free. I have not really experienced whiter teeth like other people have but I drink a lot of coffee. I love it though!</li>
    <li> Ultimately, I couldn&#x27;t get past the taste and the little slivers breaking off in my mouth. It tasted like a perfumed twig.</li>
    <li> My Miswak arrived and it appeared to be moldy and hard. The part that wasn&#x27;t moldy looked like a stale gnawed on salty pretzel stick. Definitely not what a Miswak is supposed to look/feel like. I got a refund and ordered this brand instead. It had the added bonus of coming in a container pen for the same price as this one without the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CGC0HGC/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. This is my first miswak and will not be the last. I decided to switch to miswak from a plastic bristled regular toothbrush which accumulates bacteria over a short time. After I brush with the miswak it leaves a much better aftertaste than a regular toothbrush. Highly recommend this natural brush.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect even with all the research I did and YouTube I watched. I wanted something that was easy to take with me where ever I go. The taste of the stick is interesting.. and I&#x27;m getting used to the texture of the &#x27;bristles&#x27;. Over all I do like it and I will get more. I might even introduce one to my little one when she gets some teeth of course :)</li>
    <li> It has a weird smell and dries as soon as it comes out of the packaging. Not at all as how I remember it in my country. Does not even clean the teeth at all, just leaves tiny fibers in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not completely sure this is a perfect replacement for brushing with toothpaste, but it does help.  It particularly helps with things stuck in the teeth, and it&#x27;s gentle.  Chewing it down and into a brush is kind of annoying, but I suppose that helps the teeth, somehow.</li>
    <li> Love good money you could spend for your health do you know The Lord Jesus  Christ then you are healthy wealthy and wise .</li>
    <li> It was shipped and received within a couple of days. The mistake was not dry at all. It sealed packed. Nice product and best part is its available anywhere within the US. I travel a lot and if I forget, I can order it and usually there Ina couple of days.</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged.  Have not used -- but I found it cheaper on e b a y.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;Ten for $10 -- so shop around.  I felt like I got gypped with this one. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will put one in my backpack, one in my purse, one at my office desk, one in the car, and a couple around my apartment so I can have them whenever I need to brush.  I&#x27;m so happy I found an alternative to those chemically filled toothpastes that are poisonous if you swallow it.  And apparently flouride is not good for us!</li>
    <li> I got this wanting to replace my toothbrush, but yuck! The taste is terrible.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still very healthy for you, but I ended up using Licorice Root instead.</li>
    <li> Leaves your teeth fresh and clean and so soft :) I think over all it does a better job than my $100 toothbrush</li>
    <li> If you like chewing on wooden stick and having mouth full of saw dust, then sure, go ahead. Don&#x27;t toss your brush though, as it cleans NOTHING.</li>
    <li> The first time I saw someone use the Peelu in North Africa,I thought it was because he could not afford a&lt;br /&gt;Western style toothbrush. Since I started using Peelu brush, I see how ignorant  I was and  I love peelu brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a week now and I love it. My mouth, teeth feel so fresh and clean after using it. I&#x27;ve stopped using my regular tooth brush and paste because this is all it takes. This stick has made my mouth feel more clean than using a brush and tooth paste. The best investment I&#x27;ve made for my health lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE! I use my stick a few times a day and at night before bed. The first day I used it I could tell a healing process had began in my mouth. Some of my teeth had became sensitive at the gum area and the first day it was gone and my teeth feel stronger. My tongue had a white coating for years and after the first day it was been gone. I feel as if my mouth has balance now with helping the good bacteria thrive. I will keep you posted, the best money I&#x27;ve spent on saving my teeth, gums and health lately.</li>
    <li> Great product, leaves teeth feeling fresh (perfume-y odor goes away after first or second use). My only problem with it is that it was much thinner than I expected it to be (expected about 3-4cm diameter, reality is more like 1.5cm), which means it takes longer to clean your teeth and you go through it faster (the bristles break easier as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying this particular product again because of the size, but I will be buying another miswak soon!  Nothing leaves my teeth feeling as clean as these things...</li>
    <li> The piece came wrapped securely yesterday. It was nice and fresh. I peeled a bit on one end as the directions said, chomped down a bit to release the fibers and then scrubbed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth felt nicely clean and the taste was not horse radish which I was worried about. There is a very very faint taste that I don&#x27;t mind at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to cut the end off at the end of the day as I found myself using it many times yesterday. It actually kept me from snacking quite as much as it gave me something in my mouth that had some flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is I only bought one. I&#x27;ll have to order more now.</li>
    <li> I really like these! I&#x27;ve been using licorice root sticks for a few months and came across miswak sticks after some research and I wanted to try them out. They clean your teeth really well and if you use them a few times a day plaque won&#x27;t form at all on your teeth. It seems like there&#x27;s never any plaque on mine and my teeth always feel really smooth, also my gums done bleed at all when I floss now. I do still rinse, floss and brush once a day and use the miswak anywhere from 3 to 5 times a day. Overboard? Maybe...ever have a root canal? I rest my case. I read a study that said using miswak in addtion to brushing worked better than just brushing or just miswak. I&#x27;ve also read another that said its more effctive than brushing. Either way it&#x27;s good for your teeth :) Easy to carry, I keep mine in a plastic toothbrush container. As far as the taste goes, it&#x27;s kinda like ginseng to me but very faint. If ur turned off by the taste (or you want to mix things up a bit) you could soak the bristles in some rose water which is really nice. You could search around for flavored miswak too.I&#x27;m not sure if Al-Falah makes them flavored but Al Khair makes lime and mint. Both flavors are good. Some other miswak come in clove and cinnamon too.</li>
