      <li>Love the product!</li>
      <li>This product smells like very strong strawberry cough medicine</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but I did purchase it from a reputable salon.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Has a nice light fruity smell to it as well.  </li>
      <li>This product did what I wanted it to, made my fine hair volumized and added moisture to it.</li>
      <li>Got it quick though with no problem!</li>
      <li>It helps smooth the hair and does not make it greasy.</li>
      <li>Fantastic styling product for curly hair.</li>
      <li>Worth the added expense.  </li>
      <li>have very straight hair.</li>
      <li>The smell was so strong it was pointed out to me by several friends and co-workers!</li>
      <li>Very sticky don&#x27;t hold well</li>
      <li>This was significantly more expensive but is definitely a better product.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of their products from the Bed Head line and although I switch between two different shampoos (both not Bed Head products) and two different leave-in conditioners (one of them not a Bed Head product), I still absolutely love this leave-in conditioner and find it works as intended.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this.  </li>
      <li>I live in California, so it&#x27;s not that suspicious</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>MY hair and keeps it fresh all day long..</li>
      <li>Quick shipping; product as expected.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t actually use it was a leave-in conditioner when I have my hair down, but when I wear up-dos or fancy ponytails with volume on top.</li>
      <li>I definitely had more oomph and less of that stringy look by the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>I have very thin hair, this gives me just enough body and texture to make it look great</li>
      <li>Has a weird smell too, which is unusual for Bed Head products, they usually smell really good!</li>
      <li>The only thing I noticed was that it made a funny smell when I flat ironed my hair...</li>
      <li>BUT as soon as my hair had dried this product smelled exactly like pot smoke and the smell lingered all day!  </li>
      <li>I spray it on my hands then skrunch my hair, it goes from frizzy to soft curls instantly.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin, straight as a board hair with no natural volume.  </li>
      <li>This leave-in conditioner really helps in providing it with some basic volume, so my hair won&#x27;t just hang down flat, even when I don&#x27;t use hairspray or powder or anything else.&lt;br</li>

    <li> Decided to try this out since the John Freida product I use to use, I couldn&#x27;t find anymore.  This was significantly more expensive but is definitely a better product.  I have fine, thin, straight as a board hair with no natural volume.  Although not a miracle product (what is?) I definitely had more oomph and less of that stringy look by the end of the day.  Worth the added expense.  Has a nice light fruity smell to it as well.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This product smells like very strong strawberry cough medicine and I thought the smell would die down a little once it was in my hair and dried. Instead, my hair smelled like illicit drugs all day and I had to wash my hair again to get the smell to go away. It was horrible and since I&#x27;m in the military, there&#x27;s no way I could put this in my hair and go to work or be around co-workers without them being suspicious. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this.  It is the best leave in EVER MADE.  It smells great and works great.  I have been using this for years... I have no idea what I will do when or if they ever stop making it.</li>
    <li> This product did what I wanted it to, made my fine hair volumized and added moisture to it. BUT as soon as my hair had dried this product smelled exactly like pot smoke and the smell lingered all day!  The smell was so strong it was pointed out to me by several friends and co-workers! I may try to cover the scent with another product, I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle or what, but I did purchase it from a reputable salon.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Smells great and adds volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is ok....but not great. Has a weird smell too, which is unusual for Bed Head products, they usually smell really good! Got it quick though with no problem!</li>
    <li> Love the product! Have ordered this several times and will continue to use it. It makes your hair smell so good!</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I can still get this. It works SO well in. MY hair and keeps it fresh all day long..</li>
    <li> I am a TIGI Bed Head fanatic. I have a lot of their products from the Bed Head line and although I switch between two different shampoos (both not Bed Head products) and two different leave-in conditioners (one of them not a Bed Head product), I still absolutely love this leave-in conditioner and find it works as intended. I&#x27;ve been using this product for well over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight hair. I have my hair in layers and the longest layer goes down until above my rear. Because of my studies/jobs I often don&#x27;t have time to style my hair a lot, but I also don&#x27;t want my hair to look completely limp and without life. This leave-in conditioner really helps in providing it with some basic volume, so my hair won&#x27;t just hang down flat, even when I don&#x27;t use hairspray or powder or anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the formula sold in the USA is slightly different than the formula sold in Europe. I have realized that the smell of the product is different here in the USA (I prefer the European version; the American version smells as though you have smoked weed for some reason! I live in California, so it&#x27;s not that suspicious and I don&#x27;t care what people think, but I have had several people at my university ask me if I had smoked weed, since the American version of this product smells like that, once it&#x27;s dried), but I think it still works just as well.</li>
    <li> Very sticky don&#x27;t hold well</li>
    <li> This product is great in fact all of them are. :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this conditioner.  I spray it on my hands then skrunch my hair, it goes from frizzy to soft curls instantly. (I live in Florida where humidity is awful year around).  I keep a mini spray bottle in my purse and use it all day</li>
    <li> Quick shipping; product as expected.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I also use the bed head volumizing shampoo and conditioner. The only thing I noticed was that it made a funny smell when I flat ironed my hair...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t worry about this not being very big. You need very little of this product to increase the volume of your hair. A few squirts at the roots before blow-drying and you&#x27;ll notice a big difference.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t that great and it smells horrible.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I don&#x27;t actually use it was a leave-in conditioner when I have my hair down, but when I wear up-dos or fancy ponytails with volume on top. It helps smooth the hair and does not make it greasy. Unfortunately I believe this is in the process of being discontinued, because I can no longer find it in Ulta or other retailers and salons that use to sell it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic styling product for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair, this gives me just enough body and texture to make it look great</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Great value.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This is about my 4th bottle and I will purchase again when I get low.</li>
