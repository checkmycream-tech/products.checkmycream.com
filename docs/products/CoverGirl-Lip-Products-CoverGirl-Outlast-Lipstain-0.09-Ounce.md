      <li>Okay...</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t timed it, but it was gone in 3 for sure.</li>
      <li>#420 is one of my favorite colors of Outlast lipstain, it has a nice tint to it not dark at all and is great for the spring and summer.</li>
      <li>The felt tip glided on in a very familiar way.    </li>

      <li>Luckily, it is easy to reapply, cheap, and easy to tote around.</li>
      <li>so I was fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had too much free time.</li>
      <li>so I lightly touched it up.</li>
      <li>but I just wasn&#x27;t comfortable  </li>
      <li>oh well u get what u pay for , but the seller should include that the products original manufacturers seal isn&#x27;t on the product</li>
      <li>It looks great at the beginning, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.  </li>
      <li>I applied it to my clean lips and it seemed like it went on</li>
      <li>This color is like my own color but several shades darker - while still being light enough to look good.  </li>
      <li>And it does not go on smoothly or evenly as it streaks even though I primed the tip by first putting it downward on a tissue.  </li>
      <li>I have a very fair complextion with dark blonde hair and find most lipsticks are either too bright, too dark, or too everything-else to make me feel work ready.  </li>
      <li>If you didn&#x27;t have to reapply so much it would be cool.</li>
      <li>I bought it in 4 different colors and I love them all.</li>
      <li>I just bought this lip stain stick last week, so I have used it 4 or 5 times now mostly before heading to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If your lucky you can use it 4x at most before empty</li>
      <li>kind&#x27;ve hope for a little color to last most of the day.  </li>
      <li>It make my fairly plump, soft lips look dry and older</li>
      <li>This was not quite the right shade for my dark complexion as a stand alone, but it worked great in combination with other pink shades I own.</li>
      <li>The 425 tube did not have this problem, and it was easy to apply, but the color was embarrassingly too bright for everyday wear -- like you&#x27;d see on a 1940s movie star or a 1980s MTV video (Addicted to Love, for example).  </li>
      <li>I really like these pens.  </li>
      <li>However, the item pictured with on Amazon this doesn&#x27;t really look anything like the one I bought.</li>
      <li>I bought this in a darker shade hoping that a light swipe would put just enough color on my lips.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really describe it.</li>
      <li>stain is much better.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
      <li>I have this product in 3 colors and 420 is the only color I really like (the other colors seem too garishly bright).</li>
      <li>I was really interested in trying this since I have a few lipstains I love and</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it simply because I wanted something more sheer, but it lasted.</li>
      <li>This was pretty much exactly the same experience.</li>
      <li>Jemm Kidd had a better applicator but fell victim to the same fade problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very natural looking.  </li>
      <li>The benetint was too harsh when first applied and then quickly disappeared.</li>
      <li>A few minutes after application the stain dries, and I can easily apply a lip balm over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Certainly they fade after initial application, but I didn&#x27;t look like an opera singer when I stepped out of the bathroom at my mother-in-law&#x27;s house either.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>Looks natural and lasts for hours and hours.</li>
      <li>I have done professional makeup on others before</li>
      <li>It is a natural, just flushed lip look.</li>
      <li>Mine is less pink with more tan or brown.</li>
      <li>Have bought other expensive ones in the past and these by far are the best in terms of: 1.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t ever find it in the stores always out.love the lip stains and this color looks great on anyone. I strongly recommend</li>
    <li> lasting, not shiny lip color. Looks natural and lasts for hours and hours. Lipstick - out. Lipstain - in! Color over with lipstick or lip gloss if desired, and the base color will be there when the lipstick wears off.</li>
    <li> This was not quite the right shade for my dark complexion as a stand alone, but it worked great in combination with other pink shades I own. It does last a long time and is not sticky.</li>
    <li> I really like these pens.  My lips are very light and these add color without requiring lots of re-application.  I also hate getting lipstick on my teeth and that NEVER happens with any of the Outlast products I&#x27;ve used.  Note that you will need a gloss over the color to keep your lips feeling moist.</li>
    <li> awfulll not recommend it at all, it dries the lips&lt;br /&gt;and color not showing&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY NO BUY THIS ONE&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
    <li> I bought two of these stains: 420 (sassy mauve) and 425.  Like other reviewers, I am disappointed that the product doesn&#x27;t apply evenly, and it doesn&#x27;t last very long.      My 420 tube seemed quite dried out upon opening. The 425 tube did not have this problem, and it was easy to apply, but the color was embarrassingly too bright for everyday wear -- like you&#x27;d see on a 1940s movie star or a 1980s MTV video (Addicted to Love, for example).  420 (sassy mauve) is very natural looking color, and I am disappointed that my tube is a dud.</li>
    <li> I should have known better.     This looks like a kid&#x27;s marker because that&#x27;s basically what it is.     I was really interested in trying this since I have a few lipstains I love and this seemed like a good concept and a decent price.     Upon opening the container I noticed that it had an odd smell. I didn&#x27;t like that. I applied it to my clean lips and it seemed like it went on okay. But as it dried it looked uneven so I lightly touched it up. Ugh. Then it looked patchy. The felt tip glided on in a very familiar way.    Que fade-back music and dreamy lighting... It was when I was a little girl. I had some non-toxic markers. I had too much free time. I applied marker to my lips. The color went on ok. But as it dried it looked uneven. I touched it up. Then it locked patchy.     Yep. This was pretty much exactly the same experience. This is a fancy marker.     The mauve color wasn&#x27;t bad but it wasn&#x27;t good.     The texture of the product on my lips was both sticky and dry. It make my fairly plump, soft lips look dry and older like I was beyond middle aged.    I would not recommend this product to anyone. Okay... Maybe a mortal enemy.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a darker shade hoping that a light swipe would put just enough color on my lips.  When it arrived, I tore open the box and immediately grabbed a mirror to try it out.  It takes FOREVER to get enough color on. And it does not go on smoothly or evenly as it streaks even though I primed the tip by first putting it downward on a tissue.  Another problem is that it ENHANCES the lines around my lips.  How&#x27;s that happen?  I have done professional makeup on others before so I have a clue what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I like CoverGirl products, but I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> I just bought this lip stain stick last week, so I have used it 4 or 5 times now mostly before heading to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing to note: I bought the Sassy Mauve color, which gives the perfect color, I think. It is a natural, just flushed lip look. It is *the* color I wish I had for my wedding last year. However, the item pictured with on Amazon this doesn&#x27;t really look anything like the one I bought. Mine is less pink with more tan or brown. I can&#x27;t really describe it. These colors on Walgreens (if they let me post this link) are more accurate [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some other reviews of this product on other sites. They mostly complained that it was drying. I didn&#x27;t have that experience. I think my lips are too dry all the time. This did not make them worse. It did not make them better, but I didn&#x27;t buy it to make my lips moist so I was fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried two other lip stains before this one: Benetint and Jemm Kidd Make Up school. I tossed those. The benetint was too harsh when first applied and then quickly disappeared. The brush applicator made it go all over the place. Jemm Kidd had a better applicator but fell victim to the same fade problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stain is much better.&lt;br /&gt;1) You can put it on without a mirror. The marker tip applicator is probably the best way to apply a stain.&lt;br /&gt;2) The colors are nice. Certainly they fade after initial application, but I didn&#x27;t look like an opera singer when I stepped out of the bathroom at my mother-in-law&#x27;s house either.&lt;br /&gt;3) It is ultra portable, in comparison to the benetint.&lt;br /&gt;4) A few minutes after application the stain dries, and I can easily apply a lip balm over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I marked this down for: it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;outlast\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve used Cover Girl&#x27;s Outlast lip stick. I didn&#x27;t like it simply because I wanted something more sheer, but it lasted. I had to go up to CVS to get petroleum jelly to finally get it off one night. This stain wears off in 1-2 hours for me. I haven&#x27;t timed it, but it was gone in 3 for sure. Luckily, it is easy to reapply, cheap, and easy to tote around. The only thing it out lasted, was my other lip stains.for me. I haven&#x27;t timed it, but it was gone in 3 for sure.

    <li> It looks great at the beginning, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.  I kind&#x27;ve hope for a little color to last most of the day.  Great color!!</li>
    <li> I bought it in 4 different colors and I love them all. Beautiful lip stains! Have bought other expensive ones in the past and these by far are the best in terms of: 1. Price | 2. Color variety | 3. Pens stay moist unlike most. | 4. Long lasting and can be layered over a lipstick (my friend does it)that way it lasts way longer as it sets &amp; seals the lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;Could you ask for more from a lip stain... Oh yes you can use it as a cheek-stain as well!  Buy it!</li>
    <li> this is okay. it reminds me of a marker and i don&#x27;t have any shine to my lips when i use it.</li>
    <li> I have this product in 3 colors and 420 is the only color I really like (the other colors seem too garishly bright). This color (420) is perfect and goes great under lighter glosses. I have had this single stick for well over a year and it has finally given out. I would recommend this to anyone but it is important to get a good color. It is hard to tell from looking at the tube color how it is going to come out when you are wearing it.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a brand new tube of lip stain , I&#x27;m addicted to this product so I&#x27;m always looking for a good deal , when it arived it was not sealed in plastic as they are when sold  in stores , the tip didn&#x27;t look used but I just wasn&#x27;t comfortable  useing it , oh well u get what u pay for , but the seller should include that the products original manufacturers seal isn&#x27;t on the product</li>
    <li> Waste of money..they should call it doesn&#x27;t last instead of outlast. If your lucky you can use it 4x at most before empty</li>
    <li> Just received and tried....Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old and dried out ...but very little moisture in this...waste of money..used to like Cover Girl and have other products BUT this one is TERRIBLE!!!!</li>
    <li> If you didn&#x27;t have to reapply so much it would be cool.</li>
    <li> I have a very fair complextion with dark blonde hair and find most lipsticks are either too bright, too dark, or too everything-else to make me feel work ready.  This color is like my own color but several shades darker - while still being light enough to look good.  This is NOT stand-out, go to the club color, but great for daywear.  I can get through several hours without having to reapply - even at parties with food and drink.  I will buy this often.</li>
    <li> I have always loved these outlast lip stains.  This is a really nice color on my fair skin.  The 420 gives me a little darker color than the 415 but I love them both.  Very natural looking.  I put this on a couple times a day as I don&#x27;t think they last all day, but they do color and stay on for at least 4 hours.</li>
    <li> Love the color.  Looks great on.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT TO USE ANY TIME WHEN YOU ARE READY TO GET TO FEEL GOOD WITH YOUR SELF AND WITH ANYONE YOU WANT TO BE WITH.</li>
    <li> #420 is one of my favorite colors of Outlast lipstain, it has a nice tint to it not dark at all and is great for the spring and summer.</li>
