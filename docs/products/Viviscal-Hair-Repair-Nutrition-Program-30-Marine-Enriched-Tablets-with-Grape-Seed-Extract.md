      <li>This product is great for chemically processed hair.</li>
      <li>It has been great for mine and has helped it grow quite a bit.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very glad Amazon.com is carrying these products.</li>
      <li>Best part it&#x27;s all natural so no ingesting chemicals.</li>
      <li>I am very,very pleased with the results that  my hair has received since I started using &amp;#34;viviscal hair repair&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>My hair looks so much better since using the hair repair.</li>
      <li>I am so glad to have purchased this product, Viviscal tablets, to help retain my hair from falling off.  </li>
      <li>I was even more thrill to have discover that I grew more hair after 3 months.  </li>
      <li>my hair seems more healthy</li>
      <li>By then, I&#x27;m sure I will know either way</li>
      <li>The price point on this product is better for me also.  </li>
      <li>So I get it shipped automatically and at a better price.</li>
      <li>You can also see my review on the viviscal tablets and how those too are a rip off and save lots of money and get better results with going prenatal.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed the results of using this product.</li>
      <li>My hair is thicker and even the texture is better.</li>
      <li>I believe I&#x27;ll see more improvement after the 2nd month, but all in all I&#x27;m totally happy with Viviscal.</li>
      <li>Positive that In 3 months I am sure to have more growth.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>Its now June and so far so good</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t given up completely but need to get very creative with the way I take these--</li>
      <li>I think after about 6 months I started to notice the length improving, and after 1 year there was definitely a significant difference - my hair was the longest it had been in 7 years.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m a satisfied customer!</li>
      <li>My goal was thicker and longer hair - for years, I hadn&#x27;t been able to get it to grow longer than a certain point.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes even grew fuller and longer, and my hair grew faster, looked full and shiny.</li>
      <li>i am taking along with the regular viviscal hair vitamins and they are working nicely</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to several friends and they love it also.</li>
      <li>I use this daily and love what it has done for the health of my hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, and I believe it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>I did find it on another website with different packaging and with the name \\&quot;healthy hair\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very thankful for the products</li>
      <li>They really help ur hair heal, which in turn helps ur hair grow.</li>
      <li>In the second year, my hair hasn&#x27;t grown much longer than the length I achieved after 1 year, but I think it is significantly thicker and still improving.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I combined this product with vitamin B/folic acid and biotin supplements, tried to start treating my hair better (deep conditioner treatments, better hair products, less washing and use of styling tools), and cut back (pun) on highlighting and trimming it to just once every 4-6 months.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things and read a lot of reviews on products, and the reviews on Viviscal beat the others by far - and so have the results to this point!</li>
      <li>but my hair is so soft and stays that way for about 4 to 5 days.</li>
      <li>I plan on purchasing two more boxes, as it is recommended to use the hair repair for at least 90 days.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going natural.</li>
      <li>I also like that the ingredients are all natural.</li>
      <li>I am fifteen days into using this product, so it is too early to me to determine if this type of Viviscal will work for me.  </li>
      <li>To fix this, I would make sure to avoid putting cream on the problem area and only take the product every other day or so, instead of every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was recommended in MC magazine and I thought I would try it.  Two years later I&#x27;m still using it and plan on using it for the rest of my life.  My hair is longer than it&#x27;s ever been.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to several friends and they love it also.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vivical Hair Repair Tablets since March. I started using the Visicalhair Shampoo and conditioner since April. My hair was chemical damanged and fell out in Feb. of this year. I had to go to the doctor and stuff but after doing some research and seeing this producted in Ebony Managzine I decided to try it. Its now June and so far so good my hair has stopped breaking and it has started to grow back. Espically in the spots that were chemical damaged and some of the bald spots hair has started growing back. The Vivicalhair shampoo has a little smell to it but my hair is so soft and stays that way for about 4 to 5 days. I wash it as directed and I take the Viviscalhair tablets as directed as well. I am Black so our hair tends to be a little difficult depending on the texture of your hair. Mine is very Thick and Nappy at times so this producted has helped so much in repair and damage. I will never have my hair chemically processed again. I&#x27;m going natural. Using the Vivical hair products has help that a lot! I&#x27;m very thankful for the products and I&#x27;m very glad Amazon.com is carrying these products. Thank you Viviscal and Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. My eyelashes even grew fuller and longer, and my hair grew faster, looked full and shiny. I liked it so much I got the subscription through amazon. So I get it shipped automatically and at a better price.</li>
    <li> This product is great for chemically processed hair. It has been great for mine and has helped it grow quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen hair growth in just a month. Best part it&#x27;s all natural so no ingesting chemicals. Highly recommend to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This product saved my bleach blonde hair!!! My hair is thicker and even the texture is better. I would recommend this for anyone with damaged hair</li>
    <li> I am fifteen days into using this product, so it is too early to me to determine if this type of Viviscal will work for me.  I chose Viviscal Hair Repair instead of Viviscal Extra Strength because I wanted to take one pill a day, instead of two a day.  The price point on this product is better for me also.  I plan on purchasing two more boxes, as it is recommended to use the hair repair for at least 90 days.  By then, I&#x27;m sure I will know either way if I plan on continuing any further with Viviscal.</li>
    <li> They really help ur hair heal, which in turn helps ur hair grow. So don&#x27;t give up give them a chance, u won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am very,very pleased with the results that  my hair has received since I started using &amp;#34;viviscal hair repair&amp;#34;. I have a relaxer in my hair and it can cause damage 2 the hair if it does not receive the proper treatment . My hair looks so much better since using the hair repair. The hair repair treatment works from the inside out and that makes a lot of difference. I am  very &amp;#34;pleased with the results&amp;#34;!!!!!!!!!!!!!! U NEED 2 TRY IT NOW</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the results of using this product. My goal was thicker and longer hair - for years, I hadn&#x27;t been able to get it to grow longer than a certain point. I combined this product with vitamin B/folic acid and biotin supplements, tried to start treating my hair better (deep conditioner treatments, better hair products, less washing and use of styling tools), and cut back (pun) on highlighting and trimming it to just once every 4-6 months. I think after about 6 months I started to notice the length improving, and after 1 year there was definitely a significant difference - my hair was the longest it had been in 7 years. It has been 2 years now. In the second year, my hair hasn&#x27;t grown much longer than the length I achieved after 1 year, but I think it is significantly thicker and still improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: I noticed that whenever I took the product consistently/multiple days in a row, I would start to break out on my chin - and I don&#x27;t even have oily skin to begin with. To fix this, I would make sure to avoid putting cream on the problem area and only take the product every other day or so, instead of every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I would have is that it takes a long time to see the effects of product use, but I think that when it comes to hair growth, that&#x27;s just how things are.</li>
    <li> This product is no longer listed on the viviscal home page. I did find it on another website with different packaging and with the name \\&quot;healthy hair\\&quot;. On that package the ingredients are the same as this product but the dosage was two a day where this is one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since i think the ingredients are rather weak in amino acids to really make a difference for me, I&#x27;ve increased my dose to two of these a day. We shall see if any any betterment in my hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update jan 2013- I stoppped taking these. 6  months was enough time to see any results and I saw none..even taking two a day for two of the six months.&lt;br /&gt;**</li>
    <li> I decided to try these since I like Viviscal Hair Nutrient Tablets for thinning hair, but these are soooo stinky. I gag every time I try to take one. I haven&#x27;t given up completely but need to get very creative with the way I take these-- bury it in a scoop of ice cream perhaps....</li>
    <li> Trust me this is a waste of money. Just take prenatal vitamins and any women who has had a baby can tell you, it will do wonders not just for you hair, but also your eye lashes, skin, and nails. You can also see my review on the viviscal tablets and how those too are a rip off and save lots of money and get better results with going prenatal.</li>
    <li> I have been having issues with my hair breaking due to heat tools.  I use this daily and love what it has done for the health of my hair.</li>
    <li> my hair seems more healthy i am taking along with the regular viviscal hair vitamins and they are working nicely i can see fullness</li>
    <li> It did not do what I expected. I tried the tab lets and they did not help. I will not order these again .</li>
    <li> I really like this product, and I believe it&#x27;s worth the price. I&#x27;m taking 2 a day (ordering 2 boxes at a time). I have some hair loss, which I think is partly hereditary and partly because of the medication I&#x27;m on for my diabetes (metformin). My hair is *definitely* growing faster! I *think* it&#x27;s thicker, too, but that could just be my wishful thinking!. I believe I&#x27;ll see more improvement after the 2nd month, but all in all I&#x27;m totally happy with Viviscal. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things and read a lot of reviews on products, and the reviews on Viviscal beat the others by far - and so have the results to this point! I also like that the ingredients are all natural. So far I&#x27;m a satisfied customer! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Did ot work at all waste of money</li>
    <li> I am so glad to have purchased this product, Viviscal tablets, to help retain my hair from falling off.  I was even more thrill to have discover that I grew more hair after 3 months.  I will continue using this product and I recommend it too.</li>
    <li> I like this product and have noticed less breakage. Positive that In 3 months I am sure to have more growth.</li>
