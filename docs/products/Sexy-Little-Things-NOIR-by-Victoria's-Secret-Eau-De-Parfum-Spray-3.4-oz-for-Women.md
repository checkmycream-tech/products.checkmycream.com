      <li>I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
      <li>It couldn&#x27;t have been any better</li>
      <li>Love the perfume and the bottle</li>
      <li>It was just ok.  </li>
      <li>I love the packaging and how it is put together.</li>
      <li>It is sexy and irresistible.</li>
      <li>I tested this out at the mall and was pleased with the scent.</li>
      <li>I just love it and how it makes me feel.</li>
      <li>I love this scent, however, I will no longer be purchasing by eaudejoie</li>
      <li>It is undoubtedly one of the best possible perfumes I have, and I constantly am told how wonderful it smells...</li>
      <li>I was pleased how easy and quick you were able to find what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I bought as a present for my 17 year-old daughter and she loved it!</li>
      <li>Sexy Little Things Noir is a wonderful scent but the packaging needs to be reworked.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to the Sexy Little Things Noir Body Mist and it works perfect.</li>
      <li>I smelled this on a lady New year&#x27;s eve asked her what she was wearing I have loved it ever since.</li>
      <li>Fast easy love the product</li>
      <li>thanks for your product... :)</li>
      <li>I love this scent so much, but...</li>
      <li>Smells great, exactly what I expected and wanted.</li>
      <li>While the pump is vintage and fun, I found that mine stopped working after awhile.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like a teenage girl&#x27;s idea of a nice perfume</li>
      <li>Smells great but does not last long.</li>
      <li>/o pretty close to you</li>
      <li>Now I only wear it if I know I will be able to reapply as needed or</li>
      <li>This scent is a little less sweet smelling than the shimmer body spray, but still smells great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light, but is a warm, long lasting fragrance that is not offensive.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel pampered or luxurious or like I&#x27;m ready to recline on a divan and have a hot man feed me chocolate and brush my hair.</li>
      <li>So I have a large bottle of perfume that I have to dab on by hand.</li>
      <li>Not a strong scent just a sweet, sexy whiff of fragrance.</li>
      <li>i just cant keep my nose away from her haha</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have anything else to say about it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gentle tease of a fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried fixing it but ultimately, I think I&#x27;m going to have to transfer the remainder of the perfume into a cheap dollar store spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Arrived fast.</li>
      <li>I paid too much for this bottle for that to happen.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>What I mean it smells nice is that I love the scent but the downside was  the scent won&#x27;t last for even an hour or two.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more floral and less spicy.</li>
      <li>I put it on in evening and till next afternoon, the scent stayed pretty much.</li>
      <li>Normally perfume lasts forever on me.</li>
      <li>I was buying it as a present for my friend and she loves it so much!</li>
      <li>I wanted for a message to be enclosed with this order which I marked as a &amp;#34;GIFT.&amp;#34; The recipient of this gift received an bill with the price which I denoted for it not to show.</li>
      <li>This perfume will last 4-6 hours at the most, when usually any perfume will last at least 12 hours, 24 or more if its a high quality fragrance.</li>
      <li>I have other scents that are not even eau de parfum but rather eau de toilette (which is not as strong or long lasting as eau de parfum) and they last 10</li>
      <li>Apparently this fragrance is discontinued.</li>
      <li>I notice this with most victoria&#x27;s secret sccents.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear much, but I would have to apply dozens of pumps to get a single spray expected from a normal bottle.  </li>
      <li>Sexy Little Things is the type of perfume you can wear all day long; it is really gentle (I hate strong perfumes in the morning)and</li>
      <li>the pump spray added a little extra touch she appreciated</li>

<li> Even after EDTs last a long time on me.</li>
<li> The smell does not last long might have to invest on the lotion</li>
<li> I read the reviews stating that its not so long lasting.</li>
<li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long as soon as you spary it the smell goes away.</li>
<li> only thing I would change about it is how long it lasts.</li>
<li> This product is a true identity of Victoria secret.</li>

<li> Live this perfume but the mister part broke right away :(</li>
<li> Not very exciting.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s actually a bit sweet smelling for my taste, and the bulb atomizer is darn annoying &amp; dispenses very little perfume.  </li>
<li> The label on bottle says &amp;#34;Sexy Little Thing Noir&amp;#34; on the picture.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not pleased at all</li>
<li> I thought it was nostalgic &amp; charming when I purchase it; hate it now!  </li>
<li> Negative eleventy for design.</li>
<li> I was sent a bottle that says &amp;#34;Victoria Secret Noir&amp;#34; on the bottle.</li>
<li> The one I got and the one that is pictured by Victoria Secret.</li>
<li> I think this is a fake.</li>
<li> No, I feel awkward and p*ssed that the perfume mist is going *everywhere</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.</li>
<li> Annoying!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Purchased this because it was on sale cheaper then it was in the store. This is the real deal and was a good purchase, arrived as described!</li>
    <li> I got the shimmer spray of this scent @ the store and loved it. This scent is a little less sweet smelling than the shimmer body spray, but still smells great! It&#x27;s a great sophisticated, but not overly stuffy perfume.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me for christmas. i love it! and it feels so fancy with the applicator. :)</li>
    <li> I tried a friend&#x27;s body spray in this fragrance, so I ordered the perfume for myself.  It&#x27;s actually a bit sweet smelling for my taste, and the bulb atomizer is darn annoying &amp; dispenses very little perfume.  I thought it was nostalgic &amp; charming when I purchase it; hate it now!  I don&#x27;t wear much, but I would have to apply dozens of pumps to get a single spray expected from a normal bottle.  Annoying!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume, it&#x27;s sweet, and beautiful, and feminine. It is undoubtedly one of the best possible perfumes I have, and I constantly am told how wonderful it smells...one tiny problem, it has zero staying power. You could shower in it, and a half an hour later, can&#x27;t tell you ever put it on. I have recently begun to layer it with the lotion, and that helps a bit, so if you buy the perfume, consider buying the lotion as well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. It&#x27;s so light, but is a warm, long lasting fragrance that is not offensive. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments on how it smells while wearing it.</li>
    <li> I really really really love this perfume, it&#x27;s authentic and it smells very good It&#x27;s diffrent from others and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> What I mean it smells nice is that I love the scent but the downside was  the scent won&#x27;t last for even an hour or two. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed with this  product and it would be lovely if the scent can last within the day.</li>
    <li> Love the perfume and the bottle just wonderful... I am so happy with the product and the services rate this a 5 star.. smells devine too.. thanks for your product... :)</li>
    <li> Great price for the perfum, it smells amazing. The smell does not last long might have to invest on the lotion</li>
    <li> Perfection in a bottle my wife loved it!!!! It couldn&#x27;t have been any better the pump spray added a little extra touch she appreciated</li>
    <li> It was just ok.  It doesn&#x27;t last through the day. I won&#x27;t order it again. The sprayer does work nicely.</li>
    <li> Great coconut smell.I like this perfume. Moderate lasting perfume.</li>
    <li> I tested this out at the mall and was pleased with the scent. However, the atomizer didn&#x27;t work. I had to pour the parfum in a travel spray bottle. I paid too much for this bottle for that to happen. I won&#x27;t recommend this spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I never could get the perfume atomizer to work.  So I have a large bottle of perfume that I have to dab on by hand. Not very exciting.</li>
    <li> The wife has had this one for over six month now.  The smell of this one tops all of the perfume that she has.  She loves it too.</li>
    <li> I love this scent so much, but... I despise the atomizer. I don&#x27;t feel pampered or luxurious or like I&#x27;m ready to recline on a divan and have a hot man feed me chocolate and brush my hair. No, I feel awkward and p*ssed that the perfume mist is going *everywhere* else than where I want it. So, five stars for scent and price. Negative eleventy for design.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my girlfriend as a present,it smells amazing i just cant keep my nose away from her haha,i would recommend this for all girls as it should keep you s/o pretty close to you it smells so so so so so good</li>
    <li> This scent is nice but you can tell it is made very cheaply.  I have other scents that are not even eau de parfum but rather eau de toilette (which is not as strong or long lasting as eau de parfum) and they last 10 x&#x27;s longer!  If you apply this in the morning like I do before I go to work, by the time you make it to your job it is as if you are not even wearing any scent at all.  I do not at all recommend this for that reason.  I notice this with most victoria&#x27;s secret sccents.  I don&#x27;t know what it is.  But I will be sticking with my french perfumes from now on.</li>
    <li> I smelled this on a lady New year&#x27;s eve asked her what she was wearing I have loved it ever since. I get compliments on it regularly. Not a strong scent just a sweet, sexy whiff of fragrance.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance. I thought I loved Very Sexy, but this is so much better. It&#x27;s more floral and less spicy. It&#x27;s a gentle tease of a fragrance. Suitable for year long wear, day or night, dressy or casual. Not too fanciful for the office but ageless. It doesn&#x27;t smell like a teenage girl&#x27;s idea of a nice perfume but it doesn&#x27;t smell like a grandmother either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change about it is how long it lasts. Normally perfume lasts forever on me. Even after EDTs last a long time on me. This perfume will last 4-6 hours at the most, when usually any perfume will last at least 12 hours, 24 or more if its a high quality fragrance. Now I only wear it if I know I will be able to reapply as needed or if I&#x27;m only going out for a short while.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing. I love the packaging and how it is put together. Plus I got a great deal than in the store!</li>
    <li> The label on bottle says &amp;#34;Sexy Little Thing Noir&amp;#34; on the picture. I was sent a bottle that says &amp;#34;Victoria Secret Noir&amp;#34; on the bottle. I brought the bottle to Victoria Secrets and showed this to the sales women. She said she has never seen that label on the bottle and verified it by looking at her stock. I think this is a fake. I put both photos on. The one I got and the one that is pictured by Victoria Secret.</li>
    <li> This product is a true identity of Victoria secret. It is sexy and irresistible. I wanted it since a long time and I finally have it now. I read the reviews stating that its not so long lasting. But, I had a different experience. I put it on in evening and till next afternoon, the scent stayed pretty much. My suggestions would be to just go with it.</li>
    <li> Smells great but does not last long.</li>
    <li> Fast easy love the product</li>
    <li> Arrived fast. Smells great, exactly what I expected and wanted. I don&#x27;t really have anything else to say about it. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, however, I will no longer be purchasing by eaudejoie becuase the item I received has an atomizer that does not spray and they will not replace it.</li>
    <li> Sexy Little Things is the type of perfume you can wear all day long; it is really gentle (I hate strong perfumes in the morning)and it is discreet but at the same time seductive. The presentation is absolutely beautiful, which makes it a great present for a woman of all ages. I bought as a present for my 17 year-old daughter and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with a sprayer.......??? How is my wife supposed to use it?</li>
    <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long as soon as you spary it the smell goes away. I&#x27;m not pleased at all</li>
    <li> Sexy Little Things Noir is a wonderful scent but the packaging needs to be reworked. While the pump is vintage and fun, I found that mine stopped working after awhile. I&#x27;m wasn&#x27;t even halfway through the bottle. I&#x27;ve tried fixing it but ultimately, I think I&#x27;m going to have to transfer the remainder of the perfume into a cheap dollar store spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to the Sexy Little Things Noir Body Mist and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> I wanted for a message to be enclosed with this order which I marked as a &amp;#34;GIFT.&amp;#34; The recipient of this gift received an bill with the price which I denoted for it not to show. And they never received the message either. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Live this perfume but the mister part broke right away :(</li>
    <li> I was pleased how easy and quick you were able to find what I was looking for. Apparently this fragrance is discontinued.</li>
    <li> This is my sexy spray- spray it on and feel your woman powers gaining force! I just love it and how it makes me feel. Like when your undergarments are matching- ladies you know what I am talking about!</li>
    <li> I was buying it as a present for my friend and she loves it so much!</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this item.!!!!!! No complaints</li>
