      <li>Great application and seem like very good quality.</li>
      <li>But if you don&#x27;t feel like collecting each brush separately, this is a great option for someone who is trying to get into applying make up.  </li>
      <li>Plus a great color and feel.</li>
      <li>This collection has very nice sections.</li>
      <li>Also, the quality of the brushes is simply amazing!</li>
      <li>The over-all quality of the brushes is AMAZING!</li>

      <li>It is a great basic/starter set of brushes to own.</li>

      <li>nice case/holder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just love them and want to order another set!:)</li>
      <li>The angled face brush (natural) is awesome for blush/bronzer.</li>
      <li>So soft and they&#x27;re made in the perfect shapes and sizes.</li>
      <li>$ 99 is, in my opinion, a very reasonable price for a 12 piece kit and from what I have seen in the videos, you would also receive great value for your money.   </li>
      <li>, I know she may like that because she in to this kind of stuff, she told me that the brushes are the best she ever had, and she is been using them every single day</li>
      <li>The color is really nice, they are very pretty!</li>
      <li>The aqua color is so refreshing to look at.</li>
      <li>price increased $60 more than it was</li>
      <li>So many variety to choose from.</li>
      <li>Love the brushes.</li>
      <li>way more useful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I LOVE this brush kit.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-The case is an excellent selling part of this set because it is sturdy, well made, and you can put more than the 12 brushes in there if you have extra brushes that you would like to travel with.</li>
      <li>Lots of eye brushes and everything need for most make up application.</li>
      <li>I recently receive my brushes and all I have to say is that they are great quality brushes!!!</li>
      <li>, you can feel the quality on the product, I was able to feel  </li>
      <li>I just love this kit, although I would exchange some brushes for others that are</li>
      <li>and it picks up makeup product a lot better than some designer brushes.</li>
      <li>Sigma please lower the prices to $120 at the most.</li>
      <li>I love this collection.</li>
      <li>They are an authentic retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found it really nice when applying mineral face powder because it gave a smooth even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They have a list of authentic retailers off of Amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all when I received this kit, I notice the package looked like as if many people have opened it before.</li>
      <li>These are great brushes according to my daughter, she says they are vert soft.</li>
      <li>and Easy.</li>
      <li>So far i am loving them!</li>
      <li>Brush kit special and wonderful and prices of less than Sigma&#x27;s official website, with a portfolio of elegant brush of the skin</li>
      <li>Very nice quality brushes... great for people who are not professional... such as me.. :)</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and quality is amazing of the brushes.</li>
      <li>The only one I&#x27;m not a fan of is the angled eyeliner brush (too thick/loose), but the rest are great.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m super happy with them and think they are worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Once you&#x27;ve wash the brush, it tends to stay out of its original shape.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Things to note:&lt;br /&gt;- originally was an alternative to MAC brushes but after price increase, it&#x27;s comparable to MAC brushes</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I got this set just with the excellent quality of brushes, definitely comparable to MAC brushes and when you buy this set they beat them just because of the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sigma sent them on time and it came with suggestions for how to use the brushes and clean them.</li>
      <li>I originally wrote a ranting review but wanted to do a more in depth review for those like me, who might be really considering buying this set but can&#x27;t seem to justify paying $155 for this.</li>
      <li>I primarily got this set because I&#x27;ll be moving to Korea in a month and my normal brush carrying case was not suitcase safe</li>
      <li>of course my daughter loved them second set I bought!</li>
      <li>This product has such good advertisement</li>
      <li>I purchased many of these and will be back for more.</li>
      <li>The product came packaged just as other purchasers described and I could tell that the quality right off the bat was great.</li>
      <li>First of all these brushes are visually stunning, the colour is so vibrant!</li>
      <li>Easy to use just unclip the cylinder and your ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
      <li>Thanks sigma!!</li>
      <li>Since I have seen the Brush kit for the first time in a youtube video, I wanted it, too!</li>
      <li>Great quality brushes in a pack that will cover most/all everyday make up needs.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price</li>
      <li>The other brushes are great quality too, but I find myself using these specific brushes the most.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous colour, slightly darker than the images.</li>
      <li>All in all I am VERY pleased with the transaction, and it will most certainly not be the last Sigma product I purchase!</li>
      <li>The shipping was very fast, they came with a pamphlet that showed what all the brushes can be used for.</li>
      <li>The overseas  shipping is unbelievably fast!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-The dual fiber brush F50, I actually use for bronzer opposed to what it is actually intended for, applying liquid foundation because I do not wear it, and find that it gives a nice light even color when I am contouring my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>is because most people got this set before the price increase, earlier in September of this year (2013).</li>
      <li>The onlyreason most people have such POSITIVE reviews on blogs about these brushes</li>
      <li>I am by no means a professional makeup artist, but these brushes help me look like I am :) I love the crease brush for using dark accent shadow on the crease/corner of my eye...</li>
      <li>I use this product for daily full faced or light make-up application, really depends on the occasion for me.</li>
      <li>I really hope this will help someone else, because I pretty much wish I read something like this</li>
      <li>soon as I open the plastic wrap around the brushes a STRONG chemical order came to my face.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy the slanted brush for bigger areas of shading.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Coastal Scents, Eco tools, and Real Techniques are better price alternatives for nearly the same quality</li>
      <li>large  angled contour brush F40, this is really good for blush and other powder products, like bronzer, and depending on where you hold to brush handle you can get a heavy or light application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very attached to my new babies.</li>
      <li>Also I tried using the stippling brush for stippling and while it did a decent job</li>
      <li>Case and brushes smelled like some kind of cheap lacquer, like fake leather smell</li>
      <li>but I prefer them over my high end brushes.</li>
      <li>These are high quality brushes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These sigma brushes are perfect for professionals or for starters. They are quality brushes and feel great on your face and apply your make up perfectly. Sigma sent them on time and it came with suggestions for how to use the brushes and clean them. Thanks sigma!! i will definately order from you again. The aqua color is so refreshing to look at.</li>
    <li> I primarily got this set because I&#x27;ll be moving to Korea in a month and my normal brush carrying case was not suitcase safe (I tried and it took awhile to get the brushes back into the correct shape). I was pleasantly surprised when I got this set just with the excellent quality of brushes, definitely comparable to MAC brushes and when you buy this set they beat them just because of the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The case is an excellent selling part of this set because it is sturdy, well made, and you can put more than the 12 brushes in there if you have extra brushes that you would like to travel with. If you don&#x27;t find that you travel as much you can use both sides of the container as brush holders for all your previous brush purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The large powder brush F30, as stated by previous reviewers, does tend to shed I would think it is a plus that this brush is black because at least then you can remove the lose fibers from your face. I found it really nice when applying mineral face powder because it gave a smooth even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The dual fiber brush F50, I actually use for bronzer opposed to what it is actually intended for, applying liquid foundation because I do not wear it, and find that it gives a nice light even color when I am contouring my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The large  angled contour brush F40, this is really good for blush and other powder products, like bronzer, and depending on where you hold to brush handle you can get a heavy or light application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The eye brushes are really comparable to MAC especially the E40 brush when you are applying color to the corners of your eye or the crease just for smoking out the color. I would definitely recommend the small angle brush for eyebrows because you can do very precise lines with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT/Update: So I have now owned this brush set for almost a year and I will say one thing, it is extremely frustrating that the large powder brush, F30, STILL SHEDS I want to know where it getsall these fibers to shed on my face and remain full and fluffy. It would be one thing if I didn&#x27;t wash my brushes once a week, but I do, and I still get at least 5 hairs on my face during every use. I&#x27;ve recently stopped using it and switched back to my ECO tools large powder brush, because I cannot be bothered to take the fibers off my face EVERY morning. Also I tried using the stippling brush for stippling and while it did a decent job it wasn&#x27;t the best and absorb a lot of more of the make-up than my cheapo again Eco tools brush did.</li>
    <li> Since I have seen the Brush kit for the first time in a youtube video, I wanted it, too! I was thinking about it for a couple of months and finally decided to buy it! As I couldn&#x27;t find a UK based seller, I decided to buy if from amazon.com.   $ 99 is, in my opinion, a very reasonable price for a 12 piece kit and from what I have seen in the videos, you would also receive great value for your money.   I have ordered the Brush Set in the colour aqua on the 2nd of May, and as I live in England I expected the shipping to take up to three weeks - but I was so wrong! The brush kit arrived today, May 10. The overseas  shipping is unbelievably fast!  Also, the quality of the brushes is simply amazing! I immediately tried them out, the natural as well as the synthetic bristles are very soft and very comfortable on the skin, even on delicate areas such as the grease.   The colour of the brushes is simply adorable! Everything is on a very high quality standard.   All in all I am VERY pleased with the transaction, and it will most certainly not be the last Sigma product I purchase!</li>
    <li> I am by no means a professional makeup artist, but these brushes help me look like I am :) I love the crease brush for using dark accent shadow on the crease/corner of my eye...I can finally pull off the smokey/dramatic eye without looking like someone punched me. I also enjoy the slanted brush for bigger areas of shading. The angled face brush (natural) is awesome for blush/bronzer. I also like the small concealer brush for blemishes and under my eye. The other brushes are great quality too, but I find myself using these specific brushes the most. When I got the set, it smelled kind of bad, but it goes away quickly after you open the package and individual brushes from their packaging. Oh, and the color is my favorite!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these brushes!!! The quality is amazing. The brushes do not shed and the color is awesome.   You get what you pay for in more!!!! Amazon quote me about a month for these brushes, but I recieve the brushes within a few days. You will not be dissapointed!!! I will continue to purchase make-up from Sigma.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes according to my daughter, she says they are vert soft. The only problem she had was washing them, she takes great care because they are expensive.</li>
    <li> Ive been wanting Sigma brushes for forever, but I did not know they send internationally. Finally, I got the nerve to order and I bought them. I thought they would take forever to get to where I am at, but they did not. Shipping was fast and quality is amazing of the brushes. They are so soft and I hate to say it but I prefer them over my high end brushes. I must also say that the packaging is so incredible. The brush holder is perfect!!!!!I did a test run and it picks up makeup product a lot better than some designer brushes. I definitely will be placing an order for other brushes as well as eye shadow palletes. &lt;3 &lt;3 SIGMA!!!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on this product before I made purchase because I needed a make up brush set and I feel like spending a ridiculous amount on brushes is wrong. This product has such good advertisement so I thought I would give it a try, wrong.&lt;br /&gt;First of all when I received this kit, I notice the package looked like as if many people have opened it before. There was no description sheet in the package.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I open the plastic wrap around the brushes a STRONG chemical order came to my face. It is a harsh chemical smell, like the hair has been dipped into car oil. I packed it back and returned it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure other people have received this package and returned it for the same reason.&lt;br /&gt;I end up picking up a Eco tool brush set from a local Rite Aid, which has no order at all.</li>
    <li> Just received these brushes in the mail today. It is a great basic/starter set of brushes to own. Lots of eye brushes and everything need for most make up application. Plus a great color and feel. I will only need a few more brushes to complete my set.</li>
    <li> I purchased many of these and will be back for more. Easy to use just unclip the cylinder and your ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Fast and Easy.</li>
    <li> In my opinion there are 2 essential brushes not in the &amp;#34;essential kit&amp;#34; but it is sigma so 4 star</li>
    <li> I was looking for the perfect gift for my girlfriend and I found this one, I know she may like that because she in to this kind of stuff, she told me that the brushes are the best she ever had, and she is been using them every single day, you can feel the quality on the product, I was able to feel  just the brush quality on my face just by itself. If I ever think on making another gift for my girlfriend I&#x27;m gonna choose Sigma Makeup</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes in a pack that will cover most/all everyday make up needs.  I find them quite comparable in quality to MAC brushes, which I have collected and have withstood the test of time over the past 15 years!  But if you don&#x27;t feel like collecting each brush separately, this is a great option for someone who is trying to get into applying make up.  I was sold on the color as well!</li>
    <li> Matches up with MAC brushes.  The only one I&#x27;m not a fan of is the angled eyeliner brush (too thick/loose), but the rest are great.</li>
    <li> What can I say but excellent of course my daughter loved them second set I bought! We use them everyday.i recommend these brushes. They are a five star.</li>
    <li> I originally wrote a ranting review but wanted to do a more in depth review for those like me, who might be really considering buying this set but can&#x27;t seem to justify paying $155 for this. I really hope this will help someone else, because I pretty much wish I read something like this BEFORE I got this set. But then again, it&#x27;s Amazon, and if you&#x27;re not happy, you can simply return the product. With that said, here&#x27;s my two cents on this brush set. (This is a non bias review btw)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Soft&lt;br /&gt;- quality is good&lt;br /&gt;- picks up product well&lt;br /&gt;- comes in nice case/holder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- price increased $60 more than it was originally&lt;br /&gt;- Case and brushes smelled like some kind of cheap lacquer, like fake leather smell&lt;br /&gt;- Did not come with a brush pamphlet (you would get one through Sigma&#x27;s website)&lt;br /&gt;- sheds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note:&lt;br /&gt;- originally was an alternative to MAC brushes but after price increase, it&#x27;s comparable to MAC brushes&lt;br /&gt;- Coastal Scents, Eco tools, and Real Techniques are better price alternatives for nearly the same quality&lt;br /&gt;- the brushes are soft but aren&#x27;t that much softer than the above mentioned brand brushes for cheaper&lt;br /&gt;- they changed the ferrules to &#x27;silver&#x27; as opposed to the matte metallic turquoise&lt;br /&gt;- these brushes are MADE IN CHINA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make sure you&#x27;re not getting a FAKE set, check Sigma&#x27;s official website. They have a list of authentic retailers off of Amazon. The one I ordered from was PNN Logistics. They are an authentic retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I have used my friends 2011 brush set of this same set, but with different ferrule color. They are EXACTLY the same. The only reason the price has increased from $98 to $155 is simply due to SUPPLY AND DEMAND. Sigma has gained quite the reputation over the last couple of years and now people just consider them a \\&quot;high end\\&quot; makeup brush brand. Too bad they don&#x27;t really live up to the hype. The onlyreason most people have such POSITIVE reviews on blogs about these brushes is because most people got this set before the price increase, earlier in September of this year (2013). Sigma please lower the prices to $120 at the most. It just isn&#x27;t worth it otherwise for $155 and is a total rip off.</li>
    <li> I just love this kit, although I would exchange some brushes for others that are way more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend for begginers.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush kit. The container is faux leather, sturdy and snaps on the sides for travel. I keep mine in the bathroom, in halves, and keep my brush and comb in the second half! It perfectly matches my turquoise bathroom!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colour, slightly darker than the images. Comes with instruction paper and the holder turns into to cup to stand your brushes in. I suggest you buy for any woman/girl that&#x27;s getting started with makeup or loves makeup and doesn&#x27;t have professional brushes to apply it with.</li>
    <li> First of all these brushes are visually stunning, the colour is so vibrant! I tyred these out as soon as I got them and they are simply wonderful. Great application and seem like very good quality. Overall I&#x27;m super happy with them and think they are worth every penny!</li>
    <li> good quality brushes! will last you a lifetime!</li>
    <li> The shipping was very fast, they came with a pamphlet that showed what all the brushes can be used for. The color is really nice, they are very pretty! The over-all quality of the brushes is AMAZING! So soft and they&#x27;re made in the perfect shapes and sizes. So far i am loving them!</li>
    <li> These brushes apply makeup to perfection. I let two other friends use them and they were also amazed. These are high quality brushes.</li>
    <li> I recently receive my brushes and all I have to say is that they are great quality brushes!!! I just love them and want to order another set!:)</li>
    <li> Was given as a gift so I never used the product personally but the person I bought the brushes for was very happy with the gift.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get these because I heard wonderful things about them on YouTube and Amazon. After a month (ironically, when the return policy ends but all I want to do is exchange them), I notice the following brushes cracked at the handle:&lt;br /&gt;Eye Shading - E55&lt;br /&gt;Large Angled Contour - F40&lt;br /&gt;Foundation - F60&lt;br /&gt;Eyeliner - E05&lt;br /&gt;I can understand if it was one brush or even two but four? And before anyone tells me it&#x27;s the way I let them dry, I KNOW how to take care of brushes. I own less expensive brushes as well as more expensive and none of them have cracked at the handle. Very disappointed I can&#x27;t exchange them.</li>
    <li> I love this collection. I think it&#x27;s perfect for me. This collection has very nice sections. I chose this color because it&#x27;s my favorite ! The brushes are soft. It has all the right brushes for your everyday makeup routine. It&#x27;s perfect for taking everywhere you to to travel. The case is good for holding your brushes. Would probably concise red getting another color. (:</li>
    <li> Very nice quality brushes... great for people who are not professional... such as me.. :) Definitely worth the price</li>
    <li> Brush kit special and wonderful and prices of less than Sigma&#x27;s official website, with a portfolio of elegant brush of the skin and I would recommend my colleagues to buy them and thank</li>
    <li> Love the brushes. So many variety to choose from. The only thing I&#x27;ve notice. Once you&#x27;ve wash the brush, it tends to stay out of its original shape.</li>
    <li> I use this product for daily full faced or light make-up application, really depends on the occasion for me. The product came packaged just as other purchasers described and I could tell that the quality right off the bat was great. All the correct brushes were sent and they are all very soft and very professional looking as is the travel case that they came inside of. They do shed a bit, but I assume thats normal. Over all I am very pleased with my purchase and I&#x27;m very attached to my new babies.</li>
