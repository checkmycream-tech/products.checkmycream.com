      <li>This is, in fact, a good product.</li>

      <li>However day 3 an 4 are much better.</li>
      <li>I could not be more appreciate it.</li>

      <li>Okay, so I began to use the oil.</li>
      <li>Derm-essentials has done more for my condition in 12 hours than well over a decade of anything else.</li>
      <li>Thank-you, SCOTT for making such a wonderful product!!!</li>
      <li>For the sake of fairness, I can&#x27;t give it just one star, but to be truthful, I am still suffering.  </li>
      <li>Coconut oil, in conjunction with Head and Shoulders shampoo in the shower, worked way better to reduce and correct my inflammation.</li>
      <li>I could not be more appreciate it.</li>
      <li>Derm-essentials has done more for my condition in 12 hours than well over a decade of anything else.</li>
      <li>My scalp looked noticeably better between washes.</li>
      <li>In fact, I got better results from using Organic Coconut Oil.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I never considered putting them on top of my head</li>
      <li>My sis and nephew had it already and they also have the on and off situation mostly in their scalp and nose.</li>
      <li>and I apply it to my scalp a couple of times per week to maintain my healthy scalp.  </li>
      <li>The aroma is very soothing and pleasant - I love the aroma and smell of tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, patchouli, and sandalwood.</li>
      <li>The aroma is very soothing and pleasant - I love the aroma and smell of tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, patchouli, and sandalwood.</li>
      <li>Easy to wash out and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
      <li>It is too strong.</li>
      <li>couldnt use it as the smell was too strong</li>
      <li>Smell is so strong, it makes everyone  walk away from me.</li>
      <li>The physician tells me that many others have brought in the same product, also informing them of their successful use of it.  </li>
      <li>Within a few days of using this product, the itchy/scaly skin patches softened and the redness/burning/discomfort was greatly diminished!  </li>
      <li>Again, this has never been medically confirmed.</li>
      <li>folks, the redness and dryness around my nose went away, my skin was smooth as a baby and the redness was gone,</li>
      <li>As I write this today, it has been 3 weeks that my scalp has been flare up free, and I plan to use it as a preventative treatment once</li>
      <li>So far so good...</li>
      <li>And afterwards I applied the Derm-essentials to my scalp - 5 drops each first on the top of my head, then on each side and massaged it into my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also a bit of a neat freak, so it could have been the thought of having to clean up oil all over the house.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also a bit of a neat freak, so it could have been the thought of having to clean up oil all over the house.</li>
      <li>am now almost out of the oil and debating whether the purchase was useful in the first place or not, and whether to buy any more of the stuff.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Folks, this is tremendous.</li>
      <li>Somehow the formula is preventing the over-production of skin cells, and instead the affected areas are scabbing over--a more normal response.  </li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals.</li>
      <li>Knowing a bit about the healing properties of the oils that make up the product, I figured it was worth</li>
      <li>The condition waxed and waned but improved steadily and after about six weeks, one fine morning, I could no longer see any redness or flakiness anywhere on my face or ears.  </li>
      <li>oil smells great, made my scalp feel wonderful, and washed out perfectly, no oily, weighed down hair.  </li>
      <li>I have tried the most powerful medications available for seborrheic dermatitis and eczema, with minimal success and a lot of side effects.  </li>
      <li>cannot truly express how happy I am to have found something so small that has worked so well.</li>
      <li>cannot truly express how happy I am to have found something so small that has worked so well.</li>
      <li>You can go to the manufacturer&#x27;s website to see exactly what oils this product contains and the benefits of each ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what sorta magic they put in this blue bottle</li>
      <li>first hesitated because the athlete&#x27;s foot cream was helping me manage the situation</li>
      <li>The diagnosis is consistent with what I read online, though.  </li>
      <li>First, I&#x27;ve had this in my hair for 6 years with no relief from any medication.  </li>

      <li>You can go to the manufacturer&#x27;s website to see exactly what oils this product contains and the benefits of each ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These work, but the oral medication must be taken for 30 days to get a good result, and even then it may only last a month or so before another flare up.  </li>
      <li>- honestly I&#x27;ve been dealing with this for my entire adult life - going on about 15 years.</li>
      <li>I am now beginning to suspect that this had to do with two (unfortunately very necessary) rounds of antibiotics last year, which must have wiped out the good stuff on my skin and allowed a fungal overgrowth to occur.  </li>
      <li>After being diagnosed, I decided, however, to also give up the occasional sprinkling of Parmesan on soup, and my beloved nightly glass of red wine with dinner.  </li>
      <li>when applied to reddened and flaky skin affected by seborrheic dermatitis, it indeed calms it down effectively.</li>
      <li>I will certainly continue to research the issue.  </li>
      <li>and I am learning that certain products that I use on my scalp cause the flare ups, but I was not concerned because I knew that the Derm Essentials would take care of it, and it did.  </li>
      <li>recently visited with them in Mississippi for Christmas and somehow after being fine for six months</li>
      <li>I am pretty sure it is going to work again because it did the other time and it just CHANGED my life.</li>
      <li>I am pretty sure it is going to work again because it did the other time and it just CHANGED my life.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work as much as hoped.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>and I wish I&#x27;d had this product my whole life.</li>
      <li>Or was I really &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; but then ate something I shouldn&#x27;t have?  </li>
      <li>After all, I really had nothing to lose.  </li>
      <li>This worked really well for me after trying tons of shampoos.</li>
      <li>I expected more.</li>
      <li>the owners read this, I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you so much.</li>

      <li>not at all satisfied with this product and for the money I spent</li>
      <li>, I had light psoriasis on the back of my neck/scalp line from time to time.</li>
      <li>I received my DE oil and facial stick in the mail, I stopped the prescription Xolegel immediately; mostly because it was causing an adverse reaction of swelling up my orbital area, and also, I prefer natural remedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just WOW!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had pretty severe SD (sebaceous dermatitis) on both my lower legs and ankles for nearly 2 years.  </li>

    <li> This worked really well for me after trying tons of shampoos. Can finally run my hands through my hair without embarrassing patches.worked in less than a week and maintaining once a week now. Love that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals. Easy to wash out and leaves my hair shiny. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Hi folks, I have had seborrhea dermatitis for 6 years now and it has been an on and off situation. Sometimes when it strikes it gets really bad and some other times it is just light. I have tried everything, I mean it, everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister and nephew also have the condition and since no one knows where it comes from I have chosen to believe that it is genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently visited with them in Mississippi for Christmas and somehow after being fine for six months the condition (redness, itchiness, flakes) showed up again. Every time it does it hits me in my head, nose, eyebrows, and behind the ears. My sis and nephew had it already and they also have the on and off situation mostly in their scalp and nose. I came to the conclusion that in my case it was the weather change because I was living my life pretty much the same as I do in Costa Rica (same body soap, face wash, shampoo, etc.) Whatever this thing is, it is just awful and annoying; and psychologically affecting my family and me. My nephew even got bullied at school because of her head being red all the time and full of those disgusting red dots. We felt bad because we have done everything ( doctor, natural medicine, prayers), and to make it worse my nephew&#x27;s parents always want him to wear his hair short (poor kid is going to end up all traumatized).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you guys know, this thing is a fungus and in Costa Rica the only thing that relieved my scalp and helped me a little was athlete&#x27;s foot creams ( I discovered it after I treated a fungus I had somewhere else and then one day tried it on my scalp and everywhere I had the freaking thing) so I decided to help my nephew and sis with hair masks, the medicine that the Dr prescribed to my nephew, and the athlete&#x27;s foot cream. They felt relief but the thing just would not go away. (Only temporarily)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I decided to do more research (after 6 years there has to be new things found to treat this crap) and found this product&#x27;s website and read it all and found it quite interesting but then I thought, &amp;#34;Well, this thing might or might not work just like the other crap I have tried but at least sounds convincing enough&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first hesitated because the athlete&#x27;s foot cream was helping me manage the situation and it was not that bad (some in my head, and some in my nose sides) but then one day it grew worse and it expanded a little bit further in my nose areas heading toward my cheeks and mustache, and the behind the ears again, and the brows (those somehow started not only to itch but also to sting). I looked at the mirror and started to cry and told my sister that this could not be happening to me again. I was about to run out of the cream so I grew desperate and impulsively bought 3 packages of Derman and Clotrimazol (athlete&#x27;s foot creams) each because they come with 6 boxes each or so and they are only like 7 to 12 bucks. They were coming form third parties and were gonna arrive until January 2nd or 5th and that was making my anxiety worse. I desperately went back to Amazon and bought this product that I am reviewing having all the hope in the world that it was going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything finally arrived and I poured a lot of this on my scalp and applied some on my nose sides and around it and went to sleep. The smell isn&#x27;t uncomfortable to me, I do actually like it, and funny thing is one of my friends love it. IT WORKS, IT IS A MIRACLE!!!!!!!!!!! The next morning my face looked perfect! PERFECT! I don&#x27;t know what sorta magic they put in this blue bottle but it just works. I am not kidding here folks, the redness and dryness around my nose went away, my skin was smooth as a baby and the redness was gone, COMPLETELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks, this is tremendous. My head took only 2 days for it to completely recover but my ears, brows, nose (those are the only parts I have ever had the condition on) got cured over night. No flakes, no dryness, no itchiness, no nothing.I just could not believe it. I said, why the heck did I found this until now. All the suffering, and crying, and desperation I have been through. I don&#x27;t know for how long this thing is going to be in the market but I hope it does not go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please believe me. The reason I hesitated was because I saw the short reviews and verified purchases and said, not many people have bought this, what if the manufacturers even bought those bottles themselves to give the product popularity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well problem solved. I am happy again, and since January 1st I just got it again. I applied it tonight and will check tomorrow. I am pretty sure it is going to work again because it did the other time and it just CHANGED my life. I was worried the thing was going to spread around my face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the owners read this, I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you so much. I could not be more appreciate it. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S: My dumb sis hasn&#x27;t bought her bottle yet.I just could not believe it. I said, why the heck did I found this until now.

    <li> I tried it over night and washed the next day. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair again until 3 days later. My scalp looked noticeably better between washes. I&#x27;ve already begun recommending it to others.</li>
    <li> I have been to dermatologist for over ten years for serious skin conditions.  I have tried the most powerful medications available for seborrheic dermatitis and eczema, with minimal success and a lot of side effects.  I tried this product, Derm-Essentials for Seborrheic Dermatitis, a few years ago, and have used it ever since.  It works beautifully, without the side effects of medications.  I continue to see a dermatologist, and I take the bottle with me to show them what I&#x27;ve been using.  The physician tells me that many others have brought in the same product, also informing them of their successful use of it.  An added benefit of this  product is that it also moisturizes my skin without causing breakouts.  I am incredibly satisfied, and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME!  I was officially diagnosed with SD a few weeks ago and started using this product (and the lotion stick for facial SD) about a week ago.  (I suspect that I have had a problem with yeast/fungus for years before the outbreak on my face/neck occurred.)  Within a few days of using this product, the itchy/scaly skin patches softened and the redness/burning/discomfort was greatly diminished!  I highly recommend it to anyone who suffers from SD!  This product along with an anti-candida diet and supplements have made a huge difference in my life!  While it took years for this to develop, it has only taken a matter of days/weeks to get it under control.  I&#x27;m hoping that I will be able to cut back on using it, but for now it is the ONLY thing that I&#x27;ve found that actually WORKS!  Thank-you, SCOTT for making such a wonderful product!!!</li>
    <li> I just finished a week of continuous usage, I see I still have flakiness from dry scalp&lt;br /&gt;but not the scabs from adult cradle cap. I have only been off it for one day, so I really don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;know if it took care of it for good or not.  It seems to have taken care of the major hot spots,&lt;br /&gt;but it has only been one day, so who knows...I just want to get rid of it forever.  So I guess I&lt;br /&gt;shall just wait and see how it goes.  So far so good...</li>
    <li> Had horrible dandruff and tried a large variety of products with no solution. Then I bought this and it worked perfectly. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT FOR ITCHY SCALP,BUT YOU NEED TO RINSE IT OFF DUE TO HAIR LOOKING GREASY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not cured. But it sure helps keep things under control.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;ve had this in my hair for 6 years with no relief from any medication.  This is a very oily, very greasy product and can only be used at night when you won&#x27;t be going out.  You can feel it&#x27;s got mint of some sort in it.  Doesn&#x27;t burn, but you can feel it tingle a little.  I slept with it on and when I woke up I just wanted to scrub my scalp and not feel so greasy.  When I did that, using an organic shampoo as recommended I have to say the dry scaly patches were less scaly and that was good.  I seem to have far less itchiness as well so these two are great strides of improvement.  Now here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m cheating.  I also bought the companion product for Facial use.  It comes in a stick like a chap stick would be.  I&#x27;m using that product on my scalp by parting my hair and running the edge along the affected areas.  That I can get away with during the day because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair a greasy, stringy mess.  I will still use this product at night when I can let it soak in and do it&#x27;s job overnight and washing my hair in the morning.  Hopefully, this combination will do the trick.  Will advise on that after giving it a few weeks trial.</li>
    <li> couldnt use it as the smell was too strong</li>
    <li> Seems to work against Seborrheic Dematities, as I have a couple of these bumps.  I was hoping it would help with the redness of my face, which may be Rosacea, and it did not.  Of course this medicine makes no claims to work against Rosacea.</li>
    <li> It smelled nice and felt soothing on my inflamed scalp, but it was no miracle in a jar. In fact, I got better results from using Organic Coconut Oil.  Coconut oil, in conjunction with Head and Shoulders shampoo in the shower, worked way better to reduce and correct my inflammation.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with seborrheic dermatitis for a long time now, which presents itself in the way of severe flaking on my scalp.  It&#x27;s annoying and sometimes embarrassing.  I have been to my doctor several times and been prescribed oral medication as well as prescription shampoos to use.  These work, but the oral medication must be taken for 30 days to get a good result, and even then it may only last a month or so before another flare up.  It&#x27;s not really an optimal route to take, but for me it had been the only option at times.  When I first discovered Derm Essentials, I decided to give it a try.  After all, I really had nothing to lose.  I was extremely impressed with the results!  I used the oil on my scalp daily for 7 days in a row.  During that time I had no flaking whatsoever and I maintained a healthy scalp for some time after that.  I have had one other flare up and I am learning that certain products that I use on my scalp cause the flare ups, but I was not concerned because I knew that the Derm Essentials would take care of it, and it did.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 4 months now and I apply it to my scalp a couple of times per week to maintain my healthy scalp.  Also, I also get compliments on the way my hair smells when I use this product due to the essential oils that are in it.  I am so thankful that I have found this product and that it is a natural remedy to my problem.  I highly recommend this product to others who are experiencing similar problems.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make it worse, but it certainly did not help.</li>
    <li> Does not work as described.</li>
    <li> did not work at all...very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I had an awful case of seborrheic dermatitis and/or seborrheic psoriasis this past August.  Used Xolegel prescribed by doctor, and the flare ups would go away after 2 days, then reappear worse than ever after a week.  After this happening 3 times as well as the Xolegel making my orbital area swollen for two mornings, I found Derm-Essentials. I have reviewed the facial stick separately, and this review is for the oil, which I also purchased because long before I had the breakout on my face, I had light psoriasis on the back of my neck/scalp line from time to time. I have used medicated shampoo in the past, but have been looking for a natural choice, to get away from chemicals.  This is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this oil in conjunction with the facial stick, and here is why:&lt;br /&gt;1) I am already susceptible to psoriasis at the base of my scalp that meets the top of my neck.  This stuff can spread to other areas, which is probably why 3 years after my very first psoriasis breakout on my scalp, I had breakouts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is advised to treat your scalp with medicated shampoo when you’re also treating your face.&lt;br /&gt;3) I wanted a healthier scalp and to foster an environment on my scalp where my hair will grow thicker, longer and stronger, with no chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my DE oil and facial stick in the mail, I stopped the prescription Xolegel immediately; mostly because it was causing an adverse reaction of swelling up my orbital area, and also, I prefer natural remedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil smells great, made my scalp feel wonderful, and washed out perfectly, no oily, weighed down hair.  I left it in overnight and washed my hair in the morning.  I also dabbed a bit on underneath my hair, around my neck, since no one can see that area during the day with my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil works great!  At the height of the rash severity on my face, sure enough a flare up on my scalp began, as well as a small spot on one ear lobe.  This oil stoppedthe flare up and within 2 applications, there was no trace left! As I write this today, it has been 3 weeks that my scalp has been flare up free, and I plan to use it as a preventative treatment once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That ensures me that in the future, if I every experience a flare up on my scalp or face, application of this product can nip it in the bud and stop it before it becomes anything worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend Derm-Essentials.  If you’re going to use it for your scalp, use the oil, but for the face, I’ve used both, and they are pretty much the same.  It’s your preference, but I do prefer the facial stick for my facial SD/SP.</li>
    <li> Smell is so strong, it makes everyone  walk away from me. Very expensive</li>
    <li> I have had a terribly thick patch of dermatitis/psoriasis on my scalp for years that nothing seemed to help get rid of. This has almost completely gotten rid of it in just a week! Great Stuff!</li>
    <li> Wow. Just WOW!!! So I have never been to see a doctor for whatever condition I have had - honestly I&#x27;ve been dealing with this for my entire adult life - going on about 15 years. It was a nuisance, a hindrance, and to some degree it was seasonal, but never in my opinion severe enough to seek medical attention. Besides I always figured they would just prescribe a 2% ketoconazole shampoo, and I was already using the non-prescription strength.  I have had inflammation of the skin and scalp above and behind my ears and from what I have read on the internet, I always assumed it was some type of seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis. Again, this has never been medically confirmed. I have been cutting my own hair with clippers without using a guard again since I was about 18-19 because it always seemed that it worsened with longer hair. I have tried every type of medicated shampoo/remedy out there - pyrithione zinc, Neutragena T-Gel, salicylic acid, tea tree oil and tea tree oil shampoos, capsaicin (by adding ground red pepper to my shampoo - that was a disaster), and for the last 10 years or so I&#x27;ve been using ketoconazole with very limited results. In the summer when I sweat a lot, the spots on my head diminish, but I have more issues with the flaking of skin behind my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, enough about my &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; and onto this product - I had seen this product on the internet and contemplated buying it for a few months before I looked it up on Amazon and decided to pull the trigger. As it is not a prime item, it took an extra day or two to reach my doorstep. Since the temperature here in Oklahoma has been in the teens and twenties the last several weeks, the product arrived somewhat solidified - I let it sit for at least a day to warm up. When I showered this morning, I intentionally used a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo and skipped the medicated crap. And afterwards I applied the Derm-essentials to my scalp - 5 drops each first on the top of my head, then on each side and massaged it into my skin. I grabbed an old towel to place on the back of my recliner and proceeded to conduct business as per usual for the day. So what can I say about it? Derm-essentials has done more for my condition in 12 hours than well over a decade of anything else. The itching ceased immediately. The readiness and inflammation was gone in less than an hour. You can go to the manufacturer&#x27;s website to see exactly what oils this product contains and the benefits of each ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.trustnature.com/derm-essentials/seborrheic-dermatitis.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot truly express how happy I am to have found something so small that has worked so well. The aroma is very soothing and pleasant - I love the aroma and smell of tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, patchouli, and sandalwood. I don&#x27;t know why I never considered putting them on top of my head - maybe it was some preconceived idea that adding oil to my scalp would accelerate male pattern baldness. I&#x27;m also a bit of a neat freak, so it could have been the thought of having to clean up oil all over the house. It was a dumb mental block and I wish I&#x27;d had this product my whole life.side and massaged it into my skin.

    <li> This is a tale of partial success, then deep disappointment and woe, and continued frustration and searching.  I started using this product after being diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis on my face (no scalp problems) last fall but also reading that the doctor-prescribed stuff only suppresses the symptoms. I was not interested in that but as always want to find out what causes a particular condition and to go at the roots of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I found Derm Essentials online.  Knowing a bit about the healing properties of the oils that make up the product, I figured it was worth it giving this a try.  At the very least, it could not do any harm, and I still believe that.  I also read Scott&#x27;s information about low grade, ongoing inflammation, something I have been very aware of for a long time and take very seriously.  I eat a truly superb diet.  I have not eaten any sugar or any starch, including wheat, potatoes, rice, etc., literally, no exceptions, for years.  My diet consists predominantly of lots of organic vegetables, some berries, organic eggs, grass fed beef, lots of wild caught salmon, and some nuts.  After being diagnosed, I decided, however, to also give up the occasional sprinkling of Parmesan on soup, and my beloved nightly glass of red wine with dinner.  Those were the only two remaining culprits on Scott&#x27;s list that could arguably have contributed to the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatitis at the time was located mostly near the ears, on the side of the nose, on the ears, and on the chin.  Okay, so I began to use the oil. The condition waxed and waned but improved steadily and after about six weeks, one fine morning, I could no longer see any redness or flakiness anywhere on my face or ears.  I was overjoyed.  This lasted for two days, and then the condition came roaring back with a vengeance.  It took over  my entire face, not just the previously affected areas.  It&#x27;s everywhere, cheeks, ears, forehead, chin, with severe peeling, redness, and itching.  My left ear lobe is currently bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to think.  What happened here?  Why did the symptoms come back so quickly and forcefully, after being on the wane for weeks?  Did the oil help or not?  Was the fact that I applied the oil merely incidental to a &amp;#34;recovery&amp;#34; that would have occurred anyway?  Or was I really &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; but then ate something I shouldn&#x27;t have?  But what?  Still off cheese and red wine...  Was this a misdiagnosis and what I have is something else entirely?  The diagnosis is consistent with what I read online, though.  How in the world would I even have any inflammation, given my superb diet and lifestyle?  I am now beginning to suspect that this had to do with two (unfortunately very necessary) rounds of antibiotics last year, which must have wiped out the good stuff on my skin and allowed a fungal overgrowth to occur.  But if so, now what?  Probiotics?  I already take them every day.  And eat sauerkraut and Kimchi and all that good stuff...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now almost out of the oil and debating whether the purchase was useful in the first place or not, and whether to buy any more of the stuff.  I give the product three stars because it could have been what helped in the first round, or the oil could have had nothing to do with it.  I just don&#x27;t know.  For the sake of fairness, I can&#x27;t give it just one star, but to be truthful, I am still suffering.  I will certainly continue to research the issue.  In the meantime, I applied an antifungal cream to my face for a week and the symptoms are virtually gone.  I know it&#x27;s not a long-term solution but I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  I was itching like hell and people were staring at my face, the peeling and flaking was so bad.  I&#x27;m seeing my naturopathic MD in a few days and will see if he has any ideas.  If he does, and they work, I will let you know.  My heart goes out to all of you, myself included.  This disease is not life or death, so I can&#x27;t complain toomuch.  But it&#x27;s rough.</li>
    <li> not at all satisfied with this product and for the money I spent I expected more. It was an oily mess and didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Best thing for my seborrheic dermatitisI have ever found.  Along with my shampoo, it helps loosen the crusts on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and the problem is almost cleared up! Great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually seems to work. I&#x27;ve had pretty severe SD (sebaceous dermatitis) on both my lower legs and ankles for nearly 2 years.  I did try coconut oil, which seemed to work for a little while, and then seemed to allow it to spread. I tried vinegar (ouch), and salt water (ouch, ouch)--all knocked it back a little, but it would return in a couple of days.  So far, I&#x27;ve used this formula for 2 weeks and the redness has gone way down, as well as the itching.  Somehow the formula is preventing the over-production of skin cells, and instead the affected areas are scabbing over--a more normal response.  The patches have reduced by half with normal skin returning.  At this rate, my case of SD could be completely healed in a month.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for me that plain coconut oil wouldn&#x27;t do. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Only on day for when writing review...I was skeptical on day 2 because the patch I was using the oil on became very sore and oozed all day. However day 3 an 4 are much better. Patch seems to shrinking and does not itch anymore. I have a good feeling this oil is going to help.</li>
    <li> I like this oil and how the skin improves when using it. I do not like the scent. It is too strong.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as much as hoped.</li>
    <li> This is, in fact, a good product. when applied to reddened and flaky skin affected by seborrheic dermatitis, it indeed calms it down effectively. Within a couple of hours the redness disappears and the itching sensation goes away even sooner. As a bonus, the mixture of oils gives it a nice scent. I wish this company made a similarly effective shampoo as well.</li>
