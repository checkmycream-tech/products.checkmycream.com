      <li>I live in Denver, CO which is a dry, arid climate at high altitude</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if there really is a difference in my skin, however I feel pampered when I use the mask.</li>

    <li> I keep it in the fridge so it&#x27;s nice and cold on my face.  I don&#x27;t know if that really helps but it&#x27;s very soothing.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if there really is a difference in my skin, however I feel pampered when I use the mask.</li>
    <li> Wish there were more covers the case spills water all over needs better packaging</li>
    <li> This is a great product an was happy with my order an good service from you thank you.</li>
    <li> Great product worked well received on time</li>
    <li> My face was noticeably more moist after just one use of this mask.  Continued to improve with each subsequent use.  I recommend this product to anyone looking for a moister smoother skin.</li>
    <li> Not good at all want stay on your face</li>
    <li> This makes my face feel really smooth and firm. It is very easy to use and the price is right</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually carry on this way about a product but this one deserves sharing my experience.  I used this mask for the first time today and what a treat. It felt absolutely wonderful and totally relaxing.  I listened to some of my soft, mellow music on my iPhone and there I was---  in a spa being pampered!  No kidding, not only did it feel great but the results were amazing. My skin looked and felt so much smoother &amp; softer afterwards.  I really love it and look forward to treating myself again. If you buy this product, and I highly recommend it, be sure to use it in a quiet relaxing place, chill out and enjoy every minute of this luxury treatment and the amazing results.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for me. No result after use. The mask doesn&#x27;t mold to my face easily .</li>
    <li> These are fun to use and feel like a drink for your face.  I live in Denver, CO which is a dry, arid climate at high altitude and these help to keep my pores small and my cheeks pink.  Gives a youthful glow when you&#x27;re done, would recommend these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a wet plastic mask. Drips and does not stay in place at all.</li>
    <li> Skin look tighten and freshed</li>
    <li> Still using it , but so far so good . I could not monitor ganges from the first package ,because of my friends they consume them all. But, I&#x27;ll order another pack for sure.</li>
    <li> One time use .. Good results so far. It moisturizers it is a good product. Will be considering it in the future.</li>
    <li> I got these and I don&#x27;t know what I expected, but these are not easy to use, and their in some kind of liquid. When I put it on my face the liquid dripped in my eye and really burned. Maybe I&#x27;m just not smart enough to use them, but in my book it&#x27;s a no go. They also made both of my eyes puffy even though I only got the liquid in one of them. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use them again. Like I said maybe it&#x27;s just me, but that&#x27;s my opinion.</li>
    <li> i love the mask. it made my skin firmer and brighter. i have always been told i have nice skin this just enhanced it</li>
    <li> Gave mother her first ever facial, and she is no spring chicken anymore, way past her prime. She felt a difference in texture of her skin right away. She asked for another one before I left, but I have not done so again yet, but will.</li>
    <li> Cool product - feels really nice when on (though a bit slimy)...mask is a bit slippery, but it&#x27;s not too bad.  My skin felt more supple after use, but it didn&#x27;t last terribly long.  Nice way to treat yourself though.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this a Zero.&lt;br /&gt;I used only one face mask. It is a slimy mess. Does not stay on your face. It is super watery. Felt no difference with this product. Not worth even $1.00</li>
    <li> junk it just fell off and would not stay on my face</li>
    <li> I loves these.  After I use one my face always feels so much softer.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time and the results were amazing.  Ordered again immediately!!!</li>
    <li> I love to find new ways to pamper myself at home!  Face masks are a great mini-pampering for someone without a lot of time!  I decided to try this mask and loved it!  After I used it, I found my skin looked more vitalized and younger!  I would definitely recommend this product to others...and it would make a great Christmas gift for anyone who likes a little pampering!  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU AT LEAST GIVE IT A TRY...and notice the difference for yourself!</li>
    <li> Love the  mask but two things I would love to see changed:&lt;br /&gt;1~  More moisture so it penetrates better&lt;br /&gt;2~ It&#x27;s a bit thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the idea and it&#x27;s almost a 5:)</li>
    <li> Face has a nice glow after first use. Face looks smoother.</li>
    <li> I have not use but I know I will love this product</li>
    <li> I only just got to using them, so to soon to tell if they work. Price was good and arrived on time. Thank you</li>
    <li> These work really well.  Moisturizers and your skin glows afterwards.</li>
