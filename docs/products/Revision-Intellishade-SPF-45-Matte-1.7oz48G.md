<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got a sample from dermatologist office and really liked it so I purchased the matte formula from Amazon. I love this product. I have very sensitive combination skin.  I have a lot of problems in the winter w rashes on my face.  This winter I found a combination of products that not only cleared my skin but left it looking healthy. I&#x27;ve been using Acure Organics Cleanser for sensitive skin and the Revision Intellishade as an all in one tinted moisturizer and sunscreen.  At night I use the Acure Organics Moisturizer for sensitive skin. My skin has never looked better. This tinted moisturizer has just enough coverage to make your skin look evenly toned and beautiful without looking like makeup. Awesome product. The Acure Organics is available through Amazon also. They are all wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Wonderful coverage and great protection.</li>
    <li> An outstanding product that is worth its price tag. A small amount goes a long way. I like it so much I even use it after the sun goes down.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t beat the SPF!  the coverage is light and since it is Matte, no shine.  Great value compared to purchasing it the doctors office!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has done it again!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. I love this makeup. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It is lightweight, blends in, perfect for summer for a foundation.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me years ago and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since.  I use it every day!</li>
    <li> This product provides the protection from the sun that I need and the moisture with color blending that I want. I keep coming back to this product. Price is high, but the quality cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> i love this product. Wear it ALL the time.&lt;br /&gt;It is sheer and a SPF.</li>
    <li> Very nice tinted moisturizer, good color and the matte finish is beautiful. Doesn&#x27;t leave your face looking oily or shinny like other products.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product!!</li>
    <li> Used on my whole face this product stays very greasy and shiny, covers nothing  and breaks me out horribly. I decided to try it as an under eye concealer since I ran out of my regular one and I love it. My milia have greatly diminished and my under eyes seems much younger looking and moisturized! not to mention it&#x27;s spf 45 :) I upped my lippies from 1 to 3 since I still would not use it on my whole face ever again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too thick it was thicker than lotion or foundation. It&#x27;s almost paste-like.</li>
    <li> I love it, I am on my third tube and can really tell the great protection it has, I will continue to use</li>
    <li> According to the Revision skincare website, the product ID numbers indicate that this is a fake version of their product. Be aware that they will not guarantee the quality or take responsibility for any reactions customers may have to this product. It is much thicker than the Intellishade that I purchased through my dermatologist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, visit this page: http://www.revisionskincare.com/authenticity</li>
    <li> I have troubled, combination skin that is very sensitive to breakouts and reactions when trying anything new. I also have hyper pigmentation which I am constantly trying to cover up and need a good sunscreen year round to prevent it from deepening. Revision Matte is fantastic! It is non greasy and non shiny even after hours of wear. It seems to diffuse the light and create an even skin tone. Unlike a make up base, this light formula spreads and looks invisible and yet it evens out the imperfections in my complexion  while being a sunscreen and an oil free moisturizer. I love this product and have had no adverse skin reactions. I have been using samples for 1 week that my dermatologist gave me and now I am purchasing the large tube!</li>
    <li> 3rd time I&#x27;ve reordered.  Great light coverage and the SPF 45 is terrific</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a year, love it.  Easy to use.  The color just blends with your skin color.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite moisturizer!!!! I&#x27;m 26 years old with mixed skin. I get the usual &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; shaped oiliness where my forehead and nose will typically get a little shiny but overall i wouldn&#x27;t consider my skin too dry or too oily. The lotion goes on without being too heavy and remains matte all day, even in the middle of a hot and humid Georgia day (Which is pretty much unheard of.) It does provide some coverage but definitely not enough to replace make up. i really like it because it gives me a soft blend without making it look like i&#x27;m wearing make up. it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and the tint also doesn&#x27;t seem to rub off on fabric once its dry, which is really nice considering I often wash my face and put on moisturizer before going to bed. Overall, a great product. I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
    <li> True matte &amp; looks great. Doesn&#x27;t emphasize facial wrinkles. I bought the non-matte too. Am conflicted as to which I prefer - the colors are slightly different. Both take a lot of effort to remove.</li>
    <li> I love the coverage and matte finish! However, I am unable to wear it any longer due to the fact that it made my skin itch and raised a red itchy hive under my eye. Beware if you have sensitive skin as i do. I started out wearing the non-matte intellishade, but my skin is too oily for it. I love both products and wish that I were able to use them.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Gives a natural look and still covers and evens out skin tone.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  Recommend it to all my clients.</li>
    <li> I use this product during the day rather than use makeup.  It is tinted &amp; blends nicely with my skin color; and BONUS, it protects my skin from the sun.  I prefer the matte finish as it looks more natural,  I use this in combination with the facial wash and nectifirm as suggested by my aesthetician.  I use an Obagi product for overnight.  All together, I am very pleased with this daily regimen--it keeps my skin looking healthy and bright.</li>
    <li> it is everything i expected</li>
    <li> One of the best foundations I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Quick delivery! Have used this product for 3 years recommended by my esthetician.</li>
    <li> like the product very much.</li>
    <li> I have had compliments from people that never compliment anyone. Not only does it look good, but it feels good. Just apply it to your face as you would a moisturizer and go. For a night out, brush on a little blush and set it with translucent finishing powder. It lasts as long as you do.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with combination/oily skin for most of my life and as I&#x27;ve gotten older, have realized that I need to wear facial sunscreen daily.  I have tried just about all of the big name brands out there but never found anything that 1) worked and 2) kept my shine at bay.  Even after only wearing it once, I can honestly say that I LOVE this sunscreen.  It left my skin feeling great without any shine and even now 8+ hours later, my skin still feels great an non-greasy.   1 point off because I really wish this came in a pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Original Intellishade SPF 45 and I did like it.  But when I saw they offered a version in a matte finish I wanted to try it.  I am using it today...and I really like it a lot!!  Everything seems to be the same as the original except...no shine.  I am very pleased and work recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I highly recommend it for anyone. It&#x27;s light weight and fragrance free. I use this daily!!</li>
    <li> love this - fast shipping, too</li>
    <li> I really love this lightweight, tinted moisturizing sun block. It covers all the bases for me and is the only foundation-type makeup I need to wear. In the sticky humidity of Mississippi, it does not get greasy and run like a streak down my face. It says it blends with all skin tones, and I guess that&#x27;s right, because once it&#x27;s on MY face (a medium Caucasian skin tone) it&#x27;s invisible yet evens out the skin tone. A bit expensive, but the tube lasts a long time. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> What an amazing product! I really love the thick yet smooth texture of the makeup. It&#x27;s very matte and not oily at all. I feel like it&#x27;s helping with evening out my skin tone when I&#x27;m not wearing make up. It&#x27;s kind of pricey but a little goes a long way - My first 1.7oz bottle lasted about 4 months but I think I was using too much in the beginning. It doesn&#x27;t show makeup lines under my mineral powder nor smear on clothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely continue to buy/recommend over and over!</li>
    <li> Yes it did meet my expectations!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This product is lightweight and still provides coverage without looking unnatural. I will be reordering, as soon as this runs out.</li>
    <li> I was very intrigued by this product as it supposedly adapts to your skin tones.  The coverage is sheer, it has a very good SPF, and does dry matte, but it looks a little orangey on my skin.  I&#x27;m a redhead, my skin tone is pretty pale with neutral-to-pink undertones and I just wasn&#x27;t pleased with the color match.  If you don&#x27;t mind looking slightly tanned, it might work but I prefer my Jane Iredale products or Smashbox&#x27;s BB cream. YMMV.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE PRODUCT IT IS KIND TO MY SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
    <li> Intellishade SPF 45 Matte is an exceptional product.  How nice is it that the sunblock is in the foundation.  The color matches most skin tones and is translucent  but with some coverage.  It seems pricey, but lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist has me using this. I like it very much. It works well, yet it is not heavy.</li>
    <li> I think its a good product just wish it was a tab bit darker</li>
    <li> Great product, and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> A must have for every day</li>
    <li> Love the silky feel and the SPF rating</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube after being introduced to it by my dermatologist.  I prefer matte after trying the samples she gave me.  I can finally just put some of this on and feel comfortable leaving the house to do small errands without having to do semi full makeup.  It gives my skin a Dewey matte glow, covers pores and covers the majority of skin imperfections and the spf 45 works great being outside in the sun.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that I can put my moisturizer on in the morning that immediately gives my skin a better complexion while protecting my skin with 45 SPF.  It&#x27;s pricey but definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> The best and I think healthiest protective product for sun-sensitive skin. I use it as makeup and like that it is not shiny nor too matte. I used in on my hand after injury because it catches a lot of sun when driving -- and no scar!</li>
    <li> I use this as my sunscreen/foundation every day.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on quickly, and does match my skin tone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of wrinkles and uneven skin tone, and while this does not cover everything,&lt;br /&gt;it evens out my skin tone and doesn&#x27;t settle in the wrinkles .  I love the fact that it is a heavy duty sunscreen and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I apply a powdered foundation over it if I need more coverage.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely.  Product used in past and works well</li>
    <li> This produce is nice alternative to regular make up with good sun screen protection.  I use several of their products.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mean to order the matte. I think the regular formula looks better on me. That is a personal preference. Otherwise the product works as advertised. This is the second tube I&#x27;ve used and I think I can see a difference. It&#x27;s also nice to be able to just put it on without makeup over it, and it covers the flaws. I love the high spf. That will come in handy here in the South this summer. The Amazon price was much lower than what I paid for it at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s sheer, lightweight while still evening out my imperfections.  I love that it also offers up SPF 45.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s blends easily and provides a good foundation for cheek and eye color.</li>
    <li> My very favorite SPF makeup- goes on smoothly and looks natural. I have tried several brands, some too thick, not high enough SPF or they didn&#x27;t match my skin tone, but this is perfect!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light and does a terrific job of making my face feel like I&#x27;m wearing nothing at all on my face.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I received this in my new beauty test tube. I have been looking for a tinted moisturizer w/sunscreen for the summer but matching my skin tone esp. where I live is almost impossible.(I am half black/half white) I have yet to find a drugstore foundation that matches and use Benefit&#x27;s Hello Flawless Oxygen WOW in Toasted Beige. I was skeptical but decided to try it and wow! I LOVE THIS! I use it like foundation, so after my moisturizer and primer, I put it on with my beauty blender. It is a PERFECT match, evens skin tone, and covers imperfections. As my skin tends to change color in the summer, depending on how much time I spend in the sun, this is going to be my summer &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; and I am purchasing the big tube. I set it afterwards with my Benefit Dr. Feel Good Complxion Balm, or my Mally Ever Color Poreless Face Defender (anyone over a &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; age should use one of these products instead of powder - ANY powder settles into fine lines and wrinkles and these two are not powder and make your face look FLAWLESS!!!!!!! Anyway - I LOVE ~ LOVE ~ LOVE this product and will continue to purchase!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I was on a boat trip with 2 other girls and they tried the product. Once they got home they both ordered it. It truly does work for all skin tones and gave us great sun protection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years and threw out my foundations.  Intellishade really does look good on every skin color I&#x27;ve seen it on, moisturizes well, provides sun screen and a healthy color.  There is a little bit of coverage, not much, so I look a little more &amp;#34;finished.&amp;#34;  People are forever telling me how great I look without makeup, because it looks that natural.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used! Perfect match to my skin tone and my daughter&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use another. Highly recommended by my dermatologist also.</li>
    <li> I like this OK.  My skin is very oily and this does not clog and does help control the oil.  I have not tried the original formula because of my oily skin.  However, the coverage is very, very thin.  If you want thicker coverage, try Garnier, which has a similar sun screen with a matte finish.  It is thicker but is only 20 SPF where this one is 45 SPF.</li>
    <li> Great tinted moisturizer for those women who want a lighter coverage and have trouble with pore-clogging foundation. I normally use Lancome or MAC, but made the switch on the advice of my esthetician. Very happy with this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year and my breakouts are virtually non-existent! At night time when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face, I don&#x27;t have to worry that I&#x27;ll have breakout like I do with the others. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative or just want to provide lighter coverage when going to the gym, etc.</li>
    <li> Hubby&amp;#34;s usual stuff. Too bad I found at Marshall&#x27;s for way less $ after the fact.</li>
    <li> It was not quite as moisturizing as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I am about to purchase my 4th tube of it, if that says anything at all. And it should, I&#x27;ve jumped from pore clogging, false promising face products and foundations for YEARS. I&#x27;m so glad a friend of mine found this and recommended it because it has changed my life. Forget CC and BB foundations,this stuff far surpasses the benefits of those. Conforms to the color of your skin, so no testing or changing your shade for summer. It comes in matte for those of us with oily pores, has SPF 45, anti aging, and moisturizes. Seriously, don&#x27;t ever use foundation again.</li>
    <li> I have oily T-zone skin so I thought this would be perfect given the matte coverage stated in the description. Not so, I stopped using it. I dont want to spend my day blotting the shine that is already increased by this product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Light and great sun protection..no weird sunscreen smell</li>
    <li> I will order again but this time will go a shade darker than I normally ordered.  I have fair skin but for some reason this is too light on my skin.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It is not just a sunblock w zinc, but a light moisturizer and a foundation that evens out your skin color. It&#x27;s light. It does take a bit blend and comes off a little on my phone screen but that&#x27;s probably due to the zinc. This is my second tube. It lasts a long time and is worth the cost and the minor little things like it messes up my phone screen a little. It&#x27;s a three in one item and it does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> great sun block with some tint.  This helps to cover any small imperfections on your skin.  I would recommend this</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It really does match to your skin tone. Like most people, I&#x27;m pale in the winter and tan in the summer, and it blends with my skin perfectly, no matter how dark or light. I love the fact that it has SPF 45 in it as Most foundations only have SPF 15. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> It works ok and I don&#x27;t get the tearing that I usually get from  sun-screen applied on my face. Only one suggestion is more colors needed. Also, does not mix well with some makeups. Cant have everything I know so I use this and am happy to always have it in my makeup purse.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first and didn&#x27;t want to write a review too quickly.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for the last 3 weeks and I like it.  It goes on smoothly and covers nicely.  There is no shine or oily feel whatsoever.  I use a sponge to apply instead of my finger tips so as not to waste it (its not cheap thats for sure).  I also find this gives me a even application. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with it.  I had first saw it at the derms office and decided to research a little bit online before getting stuck with another product.  I would buy again.  I&#x27;m curious to see how long it will last.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I generally don&#x27;t wear any kind of foundation.  This gives a light uniform coverage plus sunscreen.  I had gotten a trial size from my dermatologist and shopped on line to find a better price.</li>
    <li> I have been using Intellishade for several months now.  It matches my skin perfectly. I use it when I am not using any makeup but need a little coverage.  I also like the SPF so that I don&#x27;t need to have worry about using any other sunscreen. Takes very little time to apply in the mornings.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Does not cause break outs.  Provides SPF coverage while also acting like a foundation since it has a tint.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the coverage. It feels light and blends well without looking like a mask. Product was recommended and sold by my dermatologist. I prefer to purchase it online, though it is about the same price. I would love to see it discounted online!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s is not as heavy as a foundation, but still gives a nice smooth coverage. I have never like liquid products under my powder, but this one is perfect. Not to mention it is an SPF and has anti-aging benefits. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> My skin is very oily and I love this moisturizer because it conceals lightly and has a matte finish all day.</li>
    <li> Excellent for your skin. Everything rolled into one. The vendor shopped it on time and I received the package in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t break me out and can also use it when I don&#x27;t want to use foundation because it has excellent coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great and the product was delivered quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great sun screen for everyday wear, either as a base or a standalone sheer makeup.  It also goes along way.  Should last for weeks or months of daily use.</li>
    <li> Delighted with product.</li>
    <li> great coverage. love the way it goes on and the protection if offers as well as the perfect color match.</li>
    <li> I have probelmatic, acne prone, sun damaged skin. (I am a 58 year old man) I get IPL treatments from my Aesthetologists, who is an MD. She recommended it becuse it has a 45 sunblock in it and she picked out the color for me. The perk is that is blends into my skin almost invisibly and covers sun damage and blemishes. At the end of the day when I wash it off (and you MUST) my skin feels smooth and tight. A little pricier than regular sunblocks for the face but worth every penny! (I purchased my first tube from my doctor based upon her recommendation but save about $20 a tube on Amaznon.)</li>
    <li> My favorite sun blocking make up.  Glad I can get it on line.</li>
    <li> covers well and blends into my skin tones. Pricey.</li>
    <li> Love this product! The perfect amount of coverage that&#x27;s light weight and smooth. I use all of their products now.</li>
    <li> This everyday lotion provides great correction for dark spots from aging and excessive sun exposure. Equally as important, it provides excellent individualized tone match coverage and prevents new sunspots from developing. I need no foundation with this tinted lotion on. Best part: not at all greasy like other SPFs.</li>
    <li> Good product but you still need to wear a hat to protect face. It covers brown spots and look natural.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product, I love it!!!!  I have been using this product for years, would not leave home without it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Revision Intellishade for years now. It was recommended by my dermatologist. I&#x27;ve notice improvements on my skin.. when my skin is irritated I use this product before leaving the house and its fantastic, it does the trick and treats your skin - I have Rosacea, this product fits perfectly for those who suffer from Rosacea or acne. It not greasy and can be used under makeup. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I had used it before.This is a better deal than buying from the doctor.</li>
    <li> I love the smoothness and the subtle tint of this product plus I know I am getting great sunscreen protection without having to use more than one product.</li>
    <li> Love the coverage and</li>
    <li> I really like the revisions intellishade. I use it on our boat also since regular sunscreens for my face cause me to break out. It works very well under my foundation</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen.  It DOES seem to match my skin color and I am medium/pinkish.  Makes a nice, light base for wear on it&#x27;s own.  Pricey, but worth the price to avoid those wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I love this tinted Moisturizer.  It has a calming effect on my skin when harsh products tend to burn and peel it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. It&#x27;s a great foundation, nice creamy moisturizer, and bonus a great sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I always have a hard time finding the perfect foundation especially in the winter. This stuff is amazing.. I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like it as it is labeled as a tinted moisturizerand I didn&#x27;t think it would have enough coverage.  It has a beautiful matte coverage and helps camophlage my fine lines and pores.  So happy I recieved a sample from my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life?  I&#x27;ve tried numerous high end tinted moisturizers and many medium priced tinted moisturizers, but this product surpasses all of them.  It has the perfect protection, perfect coverage, perfect finish, and I don&#x27;t feel as if I want to immediately wash it off. It also performs better than all those foundations sitting on the shelf. Likewise, the product was shipped immediately, timely service.  I love it when I feel I got my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> Product is just what I needed and will reorder. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this product for years and continue to love it.</li>
    <li> One of the best sunscreens on the market!  Unlike many sunscreens this one looks good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this product given by a detmatologist. I loved the way it made my skin feel and particularly the tint which blended nicely into my skin tone.  I have olive undertones. It was not oily in the least and I was not allergic, as I usually am. The only difference is that I ordered the matte finish instead of the original, and I wish I hadn&#x27;t. The original seemed a bit thicker in consistency. The matte feels more watery going on, yet drier on my face. (which shows more lines). Next time...original! Love the product!</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  my dermatologist first recommended it because I have a bit of sun damage on my face.  It covers like I want with a moisturizer and a sun block all in one.  It does last a while and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Have been using Revision Intellishade Matte for a couple of years and love it. I can&#x27;t say for certain if it is improving the appearance of lines and wrinkles, but I love the shade and how it lays on my skin.  I do mix it with a little moisturizer to spread it out a little as it can go on thick otherwise.  If you are looking for full coverage, this is not the product for you.  But it does help smooth out tone and redness and give a slight glow.  The tube lasts a long time (especially if mixed with a little moisturizer).  I&#x27;m 45 years old with a few wrinkles and hate wearing regular foundation.  This product does not settle in your wrinkles and blends seamlessly into your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this creme. Makes your skin glow and I love how its one shade fits all. Good for when you have or dont have a tan. No adjusting because you havnt seen the son.</li>
    <li> I am a repeated Customer for this product. I have tried many BB and CC creams and find that Revision Intellishade is the best for my skin.  I find the Matte finish to be best.</li>
    <li> This is so perfect for me. I am usually very good at not tanning my face, but this product made it so much easier. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do-it provides a natural looking coverage that adjusts to your skin tone that is not heavy but does even out my skin tone. I ditched my other foundation for the summer because this is so nice and moisturizes as well. The best part is that the SPF 45 is right on. I spent an entire day sailing and never got burned - maybe a little bit of color from the sun, but no damage. I like the Matte but have tried the Natural color too and like that as well; it&#x27;s a little bit more dewy looking. Great product and I&#x27;ve been asked several times why my skin looks so good!</li>
    <li> I like it and use it every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Laura Mercier&#x27;s oil free tinted moisturizer for a couple of years now and thought it was as good as it gets.  My dermatologist gave me a few samples of Revision Intellishade Matte and my whole perspective on tinted moisturizers changed.  I love how this stays matte all day.  The color is perfect and is just enough to even out any redness but without a full coverage feel.  It&#x27;s also nice to have the higher SPF of 45.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> First it looks very dark but actually blends into your skin shade right away. It stays matte for the whole day so that is pretty good! The only downside for me is that it doesn&#x27;t always go smoothly and you can see some smudges. Overall this is a nice product that can be your sunblock and foundation 2 in 1.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It goes on so easy.  The makeup is very light and was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This product was awesome.  Made skin look radiant and the right amount of moisture.  Will definately order again.  Thanks! The end.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product so instead of buying at her office, I shopped around first.  I cant say this is the cheapest price but definitely a competitive price and a little cheaper than the price at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  This lotion is great for sensitive skin.  Its also nice because its slightly tinted so I wear it often with no makeup and it covers any slight imperfections.  I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but the tinting matches to the shade of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, during the winter or when my skin is exceptionally dry, this lotion is not heavy enough.  But it&#x27;s great during the summer because its very light and I barely know it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen, it goes on very well, gives you great protection from the sun and has a slight tint.</li>
    <li> This is a great product &amp; especially good for acne prone skin</li>
    <li> I love love love this product.  My sister introduced this product to me awhile back and I have used it every day since then.  It evens out my skin tone and blends flawlessly.  I love that it has SPF 45 in it, I am usually allergic to sunscreens and makeup but I have had no problem at all with this product. It has also been a very sweaty summer so far and this makeup stays put!</li>
    <li> Best overall coverage without feeling overdone</li>
    <li> Love this product, I where it everyday with or without other make up. Very light weight, and great sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd tube of this. I got a sample at a medi-spa and liked it enough to track it down here. I can&#x27;t speak to the sunscreen aspect, as I&#x27;m not out in the sun all that much and I&#x27;m not sure that the amount you would use would give adequate protection. It is, however, a great light foundation/TM. I&#x27;m pushing 60 and have been searching for that one great foundation that would give some coverage, not settle in wrinkles or pores, not oxidize, match my skin tone...basically, I was looking for the magical foundation that doesn&#x27;t really exist. This is the next best thing, though. It is light on coverage, as you would expect from a TM, but a touch of concealer blended well takes care of that. It feels pretty emollient to apply.It stays matte for a while but I usually set with powder and touch up with pressed powder after a few hours. Even in sunlight, it doesn&#x27;t oxidize to a different shade, and blends fine into my fair, NC-20 skin. It doesn&#x27;t hide the lines around my eyes but it doesn&#x27;t settle and draw attention to them, either. I like that it&#x27;s in a plastic tube--much more portable and sanitary than the more elegant frosted glass bottles and jars. All in all, it&#x27;s a repeat buy for me.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product during a facial at a spa.  I loved it so much I bought it and have several others hooked on it.  It gives a shimmer with great sun protection.  Very light and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  No need for additional make-up or sunscreen</li>
    <li> I found out about this product in 2007 at a spa in Nashville, TN. The esthetician swore by it and sent me home with samples telling me I&#x27;d love it. I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. This looks great on everyone and I love the fact that it has such a high spf.  Doesn&#x27;t matter what complexion you are (I&#x27;m African American), this blends in perfectly. I love that they have a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; version for us oily girls.</li>
    <li> Exactly what she wanted, sorry picture is not for this item.  Can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to remove the picture.</li>
    <li> I hate using Sunscreen everyday on my face because it usually ends up to thick and greasy on my face. This product is lightweight and gives you a tinted coverage which also helps smooth out your complexion. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 71 yrs.old and finding makeup that doesn&#x27;t flake off, evens out skin tones and is easy to apply is very difficult with dry, wrinkled skin.  But my dermatologist carried this makeup and the office ladies wore it even though they had different skin colors.  It was a better price at Amazon than at the Dr&#x27;s. office.  I am very pleased with it and I don&#x27;t have to worry about finding the right color for my skin, it does it all by itself.</li>
    <li> I used the product for a week or so and my skin seemed to break out so I stopped using it.  Then after a while I tried using it again but I still did not like it.  The color in the tube is beige like but it seems to lose any color when put on your face.  I would have returned it but the window for me to return to Amazon had expired.</li>
    <li> It is the same product that my Dermatologist sells, but at a much batter price.  I will order this product again.  I use it under my makeup every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 44 and alas, my skin has decided it&#x27;s middle aged.  Seemingly out of nowhere, crows feet and slightly enlarged pores have rendered my traditional light liquid foundation a poor choice (seriously, pun not intended).  This product, however, is the antidote to my dilemma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got pale-pink, slight combination skin.  This tinted sunscreen offers even, liquid coverage that stays the same color all day and doesn&#x27;t collect in my pores or irritate my skin.  You need very little product to get full coverage.  I gently pat/press  the tiniest bit onto my entire face in about 3 seconds and I&#x27;m good to go.  I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy this again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smooth coverage...an elegant product. I prefer matte over the other, it seems to be a more natural appearance and covers beautifully!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product when I received a facial at a local medi-spa and the aestetician was wearing it. I was able to purchase the product from Amazon for a little less money money. I purchased the product to wear on the weekends when I am running errands, etc but I don&#x27;t want a heavy foundation on my face due to the hotter weather, etc. I&#x27;ve been wearing this product for several weeks now and am very pleased with it. If you are looking for a full coverage product, you will not be happy with this. I would say this offers more of a sheer coverage, toning down some redness and uneveness in my skin tone which is exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I chose to get the MATTE version of this product because I normally have oily skin in the afternoon, especially in my T-Zone. This product has not made my skin more oily and it my light coverage seems to remain throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I will say I am amazed that this product offers a \\&quot;one shade fits all\\&quot;. My skin is very fair and the product blends perfectly. The best part of this product is the high SPF included. I hate having to use a seperate SPF for just running around and love that it is included with this lotion. I will say if your skin tends to be on the dry side, you may want to use a light moisturizer at times under this because it may be drying or you may want to try the non-matte version. Overall I love this product. I&#x27;ve started wearing it daily instead of my heavier foundation and think its perfect, especially on the hottest days of summer. Will definitely continue to use in the future.</li>
    <li> Used this product for years. I think it&#x27;s the best in this category.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is light, blends with my skin tone and I wear it all the time for added protection against age/dark spots when out in the sun.</li>
    <li> The product was brand new, and exactly as I had ordered it. I love the tinted moisturizer, and have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Great product. Timely delivery</li>
    <li> I have a hard time distributing this product on my face. ..</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product from my dermatologist and I loved it so I purchased it from Amazon.  When I got the product it was way darker than the sample I got from the doctor&#x27;s office.  I don&#x27;t know why but the color is not a one color suits all product.  I have contacted the company directly asking them why the sample would be so much darker and I have not heard back from them yet.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin with olive undertones and this matches it perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing for about a week and it stays on very nicely.  It has a matte like finish and makes my skin look flawless even after at the end of day with the added plus of sunscreen.  Will order more for the summer.</li>
    <li> This product is a little \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; if used alone but if you mix it with the regular product it applies great and looks fabulous. I will never use anything but this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on my skin since I&#x27;ve made the switch to Revision Intellishade. I pair this with concealer and I haven&#x27;t thought twice about my old, heavy foundation again!</li>
    <li> Watch your expiration dates!</li>
    <li> Good coverage! The product is really good. I will buy again and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for several years now and love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a year. This is about my 3rd tube. non greasy, light cover. Great price</li>
    <li> Was introduced to this product by skin professionals who charge far more than Amazon does for it.  It is a great base/sunscreen layer.  Will keep buying.</li>
    <li> I had a great facial once and they used this at the end.... Love the way it feels so I bought it here! It&#x27;s lightweight....feels silky and a tiny but goes a long way... I wasn&#x27;t sure about the color working for my skin tone as I&#x27;m olive complexioned and South Asian but its perfect and no oiliness! It&#x27;s mattifying and has spf45!! I wear it under make up and use blotting powder maybe once a day now 4-5 hours later instead of every few hours the way I used to!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Fragrance free also. Goes on easily and gives good lightweight coverage; lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey, but it is a three in one product</li>
    <li> Great price - fabulous product. I&#x27;ve spent thousands $$ over the years at high end retail stores and never gotten the quality and results this product delivers. My dermalogist suggested it since I wanted a natural looking light foundation to cover redness, small broken veins and fine lines. I was sceptical snce there is only one color. But found it blended perfectly. I got compliments immediately. The price is reasonable since it last for about 6-9 months. I would only suggest the \\&quot;matte\\&quot; but if you like a moister look the other type would be good - but for me I don&#x27;t like shiny.  you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is not for my dry skin.  Leaves my skin feeling tight and blotchy.  Maybe if this was moisturizing instead of matte it would work.</li>
    <li> Love this product line and this product in particular...I now wear sunscreen regularly because I really like this product</li>
    <li> I really like the matte finish. I have purchased the regular  version before from my dermatologist but didn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; on my face. When I saw the matte version  available I just had to have it. Great coverage and staying power.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Highly recommend this product on all skin types, on my third tube.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite make up ( Original )  I am so happy with it, that I have used it , exclusively for 3 years&lt;br /&gt;People, even strangers, have commented  on my &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; skin  I am stopped in stores and complimented&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable for a lady who had severe acne and a not very nice skin  I am 72 and not wrinkled, so I am taken for a younger person&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Intellishade in the Original Finish is perfect for me;  the Matte is perfect for my daughter</li>
    <li> There is ust enough coverage without a made-up look. Quite sheer and having the sunscreen and moisturizer built in is terrific.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product. I like it so much I bought one for my mom.  We both have fair skin and freckles. This has replaced my foundation which I was barely using anyhow. It does dry out my skin a bit if I don&#x27;t put lotion on my face first.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Has great coverage and does not feel heavy. I put it on in the morning before my powder. Price is really good. Same bottle at my Dermatoligist was 55.00</li>
    <li> I have used the shiny Intellishade before &amp; ordered the matte this time.  I prefer it &amp; was very pleased with the application &amp; how it looked on my skin!</li>
    <li> This matte sunscreen is just perfect. I wear it everyday with just a little powder. Protects my skin AND evens out the tone.</li>
    <li> Facialist recommended this make up to me and gave me a sample, I was hooked, I won&#x27;t use anything else, it goes on beautifully and looks perfect</li>
    <li> I like the product. I don&#x27;t feel it gives coverage like a foundation, but it does the job. I like to have a little less in summer anyway; I spend a lot of time outside. I did try to put a powder over the product and that did NOT work. It caked up. I think it works the best on it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> It is a great product.  I have sensative skin and i do not break out using this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up, so maybe it&#x27;s unfair of me to give a makeup product 3 stars. I bought this on my sister&#x27;s advice to wear for my wedding. She said it would just be subtle, not like makeup-y foundation. I gave it a trial run, and it looks like makeup, feels like makeup, and my husband hated it. Didn&#x27;t wear it for the wedding and gave the bottle to my sister, who loves it. Just don&#x27;t get it if you think it&#x27;s going to feel and look more like a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I can not live with out</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!! Much cheaper than purchasing at the dermatologist office!</li>
    <li> Bought this recently on advice from a friend who gets it from her dermatologist.  I love it!  After only about a week I notice significant improvement on the amount of blemishes as compared to my previous physician&#x27;s formula CC cream.  This cream is smooth and light and really feels better on my face than other products.  It offers a good amount of blemish/imperfection coverage and I love that it is actually doing my face good while I wear it!</li>
    <li> Saved me so much money Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this tinted moisturizer. I was happy to find it for about $15 cheaper than I pay at my spa/salon.I will be purchasing on Amazon  from now on.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I heard about it from my dermatologist.  I love that it&#x27;s tinted and goes on with a matte finish - no shiny, sunblock look.  And, best of all, it works!  When in and out of the sun all day, no more worries about getting too much exposure. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is good for your skin and protects you from the sun without actually using makeup.</li>
    <li> After 20 years of searching, I have finally found a protect that works with my combination skin. My skin is sensitive to sunscreen products and prone to breakouts. I highly recommend Revision Matte if you have oily skin. If my skin is dry in other areas, I just use a little moisturizer before applying Revision. After one month of using, I am still in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I never write product reviews.. but I had to share this one.</li>
    <li> Bought this after receiving a sample from the local skin renewal clinic. Cover is alright but not super thick and could still see imperfections on skin that i was trying to cover up. Would buy again because it gave skin a nice glow and evened out skin tone.</li>
    <li> This product provides adequate coverage with a slight hint of color; alleviates the need for foundation as it functions as a moisturizer and foundation in one.My daughters and I are all new fans.</li>
    <li> Revision products are really good for sensitive skin.  I use Revision tinted moisturizer on my face year round.  I like the Matte finish.</li>
    <li> Bought this product after a couple girlfriends raved about it.  I&#x27;m not too picky on my makeup so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. To my disappointment, I really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this and any other coverup I&#x27;ve used.  Bummed I spent the money on it but oh well. Ya don&#x27;t know til ya try it.</li>
    <li> I echo most of the other reviews...I love this stuff too! The only problem - and it is a big problem, is the way that the foundation dries up after each 1-2 uses, creating a seal at the tube opening that must be scraped off and thrown away, wasting this expensive product! The product also gets and flaky as you get towards the bottom of the tube.I wish they could fix the product without dramatically changing the formula! I will still by the product, but you do end up wasting a lot. Has anyone else experienced this drying of the product?</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tinted lotion.  I&#x27;ve tried several and it blends the best with every skin tone.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this stuff!  Better than any BB Cream I&#x27;ve tried. I wear it as a base before I apply my mineral powder. This was my 1st time trying the Matte finish. I like it maybe just a tad better than original because if I don&#x27;t feel like doing all my make up that day, I can just put a light layer of this on for sun protection &amp; not have to worry about my face looking oily/greasy. You know that look that sunscreen can give you, the original Itellishade can tend to do that. Which I would just apply a light layer of mineral powder to compensate &amp; most the time I do it anyways with either one, so it isn&#x27;t that big a deal for me. It&#x27;s just a little added bonus to the Matte finish Itellishade.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from my esthetician and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it. This product is three in one. It&#x27;s a moisturizer, spf 45 and has a nice coverage that works well under make up or alone. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  IT APPLIES SUPER SUPER GOOD DRIES SUPER FAST AND IT SMELLS GREAT!</li>
    <li> I am happy I have a matte SPF 45, however the coverage is minimal.  If you are looking for moderate to heavy coverage, I would stick with regular foundation and  sunscreen underneath.  It is nice to use while in daylight as it provides only sheer, minimal natural looking coverage.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I really like it. It&#x27;s not greasy and goes on smoothly and evenly - buying it through Amazon saved me money.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday use. I love that it has SPF 45.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist, and she was absolutely right. Great protection and buildiable coverage. Great for sensitive skin. No longer need foundation, nor layers of other products, just this and a little blush and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.  The item arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I have been using their moisture Intellishade SPF45 and wanted to try this Matte finish.  I will be ordering this again for sure</li>
    <li> This product is the best for all types and tones of skin. I use it daily. It covers any imperfections on the skin and you can use as sun protection as well (SPF 45) so your face is radiant and protected even if you are at the beach.</li>
