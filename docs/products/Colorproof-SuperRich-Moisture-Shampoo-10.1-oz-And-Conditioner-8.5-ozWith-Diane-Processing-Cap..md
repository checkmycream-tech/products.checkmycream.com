      <li>It lasts about 6 months if you use it right</li>
      <li>exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>Color proof is not only what Purology used to be,  it&#x27;s better.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I love this product, you only need a pea size amount to shampoo your hair, it seems to last forever.  </li>
      <li>Definitely extends my color and is helping me get my hair back to healthy after a 6 month attempt to lighten with my stylist.</li>
      <li>But other then its a fabulous product.</li>
      <li>Anti frizz formula (pink bottle) works better for mature coarse frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>I literally only have to use a nickel or dime size of shampoo and the price is so reasonable.  </li>

<li> I used to use purology before it was bought out, but after it was bought out by Loreal, the shampoo was horrible.  </li>
