      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>I had no hair in the top</li>

      <li>Easy to remember</li>

      <li>I can tell a huge difference in his tone after an emu oil massage.</li>
      <li>Feel free to email me at irvinerunner@yahoo.com.  </li>
      <li>It does not leave an oily feel on your skin, yet softens and makes your skin feel smooth again.</li>
      <li>Upon doing a little more research I found out that oils aren’t great for everyone’s hair/scalp.</li>
      <li>It is so effective that I was able to cut back on my pain meds for the fibro.  </li>
      <li>This one for my purposes has been the right fit.</li>
      <li>There is a huge market out there of oils derived from plants, herbs fruits etc without torturing and sacrificing a life that will yield the same or greater results!  </li>
      <li>The first time I put it on my hands, my skin was plump and smooth looking and my cuticles disappeared.  </li>
      <li>The second response is kind of what I was thinking, which is why I used it longer</li>
      <li>I also use it on my hair and it has made my natural curls look better.  </li>
      <li>natural IS better.</li>
      <li>this right here though, this right here...</li>
      <li>I noticed fall-out from the first time I used it, but I figured it had to be something else, because why would Emu Oil cause hair fall out?</li>
      <li>I bought this oil last month to help me regrowth the hair I lost after reading  many possitive feedbacks from others about hair regrowth with this oil.</li>
      <li>First of all, I’m not bashing the product…Emu Oil is a miracle oil with dozens of uses, so I&#x27;ll keep it at 5 stars.</li>
      <li>The emu oil that this company sells is high quality and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to/ irritated by so many products and wanted something pure and simple.  </li>
      <li>Noticed after a week how soft my hands were, and my fingernails (which I have never never been able to grow- too soft, peeling etc...)  were growing.  </li>
      <li>I just want to say that Emu oil is amazing for the hair and skin,old scars, dark marks, balding etc.</li>
      <li>Being a black woman with chemically processed hair, this oil is amazing.</li>
      <li>This product says \\&quot;Pure Premium AEA \\&quot; but when I recieved my order it says AGA on the label.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how this product absorbs so quickly - is not greasy - no smell - can do so much for skin.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>I put this oil on him and in 3 or 4 days it was healing so fast.</li>
      <li>The color of this oil is very telling of it&#x27;s quality.</li>
      <li>Thanks Koru Naturals</li>
      <li>My hair is really moisturized now.</li>
      <li>I do have to wax more frequently as it does make my facial hair grow faster.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Best brand out of a few Emu oils I have tried over the past year.</li>
      <li>After the emus are full grown, the oil is located in sack like form underneath the fat of the emu&#x27;s back.  </li>
      <li>Also, it’s nice to know this for those of us whose hair loss may be bacteria related, because there are probably options for us to completely neutralize further hair loss.</li>
      <li>First, I was pleasantly surprised on how quickly I received this product, especially since I needed it for pain.  </li>
      <li>Also the size of the bottle is bigger than I thought so there is still a lot of oil left  after 1 month of use:)</li>
      <li>So much that I have 3 days worth of meds left.  </li>
      <li>this indicates it&#x27;s purity and high grade.</li>
      <li>I cut all my hair off and decided to go natural and my hair thanks me for it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle oil as I expected, but it definitely make my skin and hair nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>and I already see new growth</li>
      <li>Emu Oil is essential if you want your glowing smooth skin and youthful appearance back.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it really does moisturize skin and hair like no other product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s working so far!</li>
      <li>Given the fact that I&#x27;ve had fibro for over 2 years, I don&#x27;t expect the pain to completely go away after one week.  </li>
      <li>I have a 5 year old with spastic Cerebral Palsy.</li>
      <li>My skin has completely evened out.</li>
      <li>Made it instantly soft.</li>
      <li>I also was looking for something to thicken my edges and so far it&#x27;s working.</li>
      <li>At the top of my head the hair was ripped out by a hairstylist, I had so much trouble trying to grow it back until now.</li>
      <li>Some of the responses were, it must just seem that way because…., or it’s probably just shedding out the old hair so new hair will grow back stronger.</li>
      <li>I am African American Brown sugar complexion and it makes my face look alive and vibrant.  </li>
      <li>I think I am the first to write a review about joint and muscle pains due to fibromyalgia.  </li>
      <li>When it comes to hair use, I learned that, with certain people (those who are prone to dandruff and/or dry scalp) such as me, the oil may cause hair fall out.  </li>
      <li>I stumbled upon this oil while searching for something for my thinning 4b natural african American hair.</li>
      <li>I purchased this Emu Oil after learning about the positive effects Emu Oil has on hair growth/regrowth…particularly in the frontal region, which few if any products are known to do.</li>
      <li>Third, I \\&quot;had\\&quot; heel spurs from running marathons for over 14 years and after applying the oil to my heels a few times a day, I actually can walk without pain for the first time in years.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the scars have to be fairly new or not, but mine are a few years old</li>

<li> It wasn&#x27;t permanent because it did grow back, no more no less.   </li>
<li> My sister is a beautician and she even noticed how my hair was starting to fill out in that area and my scalp wasnt as red and irritated as in the past prior to using this product.  </li>
<li> Wish I would&#x27;ve found this stuff a long time ago!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I will never be without this Koru Naturals Emu Oil again! Easy to remember and I keep it by my arm chair while looking at T.V. in the evenings. A few drops on my feet, ankles, toes, and rough spots are gone. Also a great healing oil for scratches or itches. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used emu oil before and I&#x27;m a big fan! Yes, it really does moisturize skin and hair like no other product. I massage it into my scalp and leave it on overnight a few nights a week...after shampooing it out in the morning,my scalp feels stimulated all day. The hair is moisturized and shiny. On skin , you can&#x27;t beat this product for smoothing out scars and imperfections. GREAT  STUFF . The emu oil that this company sells is high quality and absorbs quickly into the skin. The color of this oil is very telling of it&#x27;s quality. This one has a pale creamy translucent consistancy and is oderless ....this indicates it&#x27;s purity and high grade. The darker the oil the lower the grade.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product there was no smell to it which made it even better to work with.  I had a stress spot in the crown of my head were my hair is thining and it is now starting to grow back.  My sister is a beautician and she even noticed how my hair was starting to fill out in that area and my scalp wasnt as red and irritated as in the past prior to using this product.  I will definitely be using this product again.  I&#x27;m in the process of buying another bottle as we speak.  Thank you so much for the great product, the speedy deliver and the awesome price.  I absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle oil as I expected, but it definitely make my skin and hair nice and soft.  The first time I put it on my hands, my skin was plump and smooth looking and my cuticles disappeared.  Unfortunately, that result does not last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have amazing pain relief qualities.  I have dealt with a frozen shoulder for the past 3 years and I noticed that I have about 70% more usability and rotation of my shoulder when I use the oil.  Again, it is not a permanent solution, but it is a wonderful temporary daily solution.</li>
    <li> This product says \\&quot;Pure Premium AEA \\&quot; but when I recieved my order it says AGA on the label. AEA stands for the American Emu Association so I thought I was getting emu oil certified by the AEA. I don&#x27;t know what AGA stands for, I guess something in Australia? Don&#x27;t know if this oil is certified by any agency?</li>
    <li> Not only is this brand of emu oil useless the customer service(Paul) is even worse. If you have the sudden urge to be swindled and insulted at the same time, this is the brand for you.</li>
    <li> a person at a holistic health store recommended this product to me.  I told her I&#x27;m allergic to/ irritated by so many products and wanted something pure and simple.  Noticed after a week how soft my hands were, and my fingernails (which I have never never been able to grow- too soft, peeling etc...)  were growing.  It&#x27;s amazing how this product absorbs so quickly - is not greasy - no smell - can do so much for skin.  It&#x27;s  been about a month and I use just a couple drops &amp; massage into nails and hands - maybe a couple of times a day.   I&#x27;ve also started using a drop on my face.  sounds strange saying a \\&quot;drop\\&quot;  but it takes very little.  I&#x27;m finding more uses as I go.   I really love this product.  the price is fair, shipped quickly, packaged well.  Love it!  simple- natural IS better.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I use it on my face every morning and my skin is glowing now.  I am African American Brown sugar complexion and it makes my face look alive and vibrant.  I also use it on my hair and it has made my natural curls look better.  I just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about two weeks - I use it on my temples both day and night massaging it in and I swear - It&#x27;s the TRUTH - My temples were bald and anyplace where there remains hair follicles, I can see fuzz - Will this grow back hair if there is absolutely no follicle left - NO - but if your hair is broken or thinning - YES - it will help - Again, I have only used it for two weeks so we&#x27;ll see - Ordering my second batch</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this oil while searching for something for my thinning 4b natural african American hair. After reading the reviews and doing some of my own research I decided to give it a try. I am sorry that I didn&#x27;t know about this oil sooner. I started using it on my hair. Made it instantly soft. I also noticed hair growth in a thinning spot in my hair. After a couple of days I started using it on my face. OMG! My skin has completely evened out. I had a few dark spots and they&#x27;re gone. My crows feet are gone.My husband constantly tells me how beautiful my skin is. Even people in the grocery store want to know what I use because it has a glow about it now. I&#x27;m 47and my skin looks 27 or dare I say even younger. I must say that my skin looks and feels like brown porcelain. If you buy it you will love it. Btw my husband is a mechanic and burned his arm badly. I put this oil on him and in 3 or 4 days it was healing so fast. The color is even back. Pss. I use it on my eyelashes and they are growing.</li>
    <li> I had small bumps forming on my feet and ankles and the dermatologist just suggested lotion and then scrapping them off (which didn&#x27;t work). I ran across this on a web site and decided to give it a try. The little bumps dissapeared in 3 days!!!! It does not leave an oily feel on your skin, yet softens and makes your skin feel smooth again. Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE this oil!! Being a black woman with chemically processed hair, this oil is amazing. I use it on an area in my scalp that was thinning and I already see new growth and it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks. I use it twice a day and massage the area on my scalp. I also use this oil for my son&#x27;s eczema and on my blemishes that I have occasionally. Wish I would&#x27;ve found this stuff a long time ago!</li>
    <li> Emu birds are killed for oil extraction.  After the emus are full grown, the oil is located in sack like form underneath the fat of the emu&#x27;s back.  There is a huge market out there of oils derived from plants, herbs fruits etc without torturing and sacrificing a life that will yield the same or greater results!  There is coconut, avocado, alma, almond,  jojoba, marula, rosemary, castor, olive, grapeseed,  pomegranate, kola and  shea nut oil just to name a few... You don&#x27;t need emu oil to moisturize skin, hair or burned hair from relaxer etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two bottles of this now, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying again.  It hasn&#x27;t helped my hair growth or dry scalp, it doesn&#x27;t feel moisturizing on my skin (in fact it feels like a layer of slime that&#x27;s very hard to wash off), and it didn&#x27;t remove scars (even subtle ones).  Just one more overhyped and overrated &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; oil.</li>
    <li> I just want to say that Emu oil is amazing for the hair and skin,old scars, dark marks, balding etc. I had no hope for my hair until I did some research and found this oil. At the top of my head the hair was ripped out by a hairstylist, I had so much trouble trying to grow it back until now. I use the oil by itself or you can mix it with Jamacian black castor oil or whatever oils you want. I had no hair in the top not at all now its been 2weeks and I can put a braid on my edges.You can feel some kind of difference once the oil settles in the scalp amazing!!</li>
    <li> I bought my dad this emu oil because I heard it stimulates the hair follicles and helps grow hair. Within two weeks, my dad saw results and his scalp looks fuller. All of his friends and our family has noticed this big improvement. Some people thought my dad got hair restoration surgery!</li>
    <li> I have researched Emu Oil on the internet literally for hours and was amazed on how beneficial it is. Because I have kidney failure and also taking blood thinners, everything has to be approved by my specialists. [Both said it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.]  Additionally, I have fibromyalgia.  The majority of the reviews talk about the effectiveness of skin problems, but I think I am the first to write a review about joint and muscle pains due to fibromyalgia.  First, I was pleasantly surprised on how quickly I received this product, especially since I needed it for pain.  Second, I have been using it for a week now and I am AMAZED how the joint and muscle pains have subsided.  Given the fact that I&#x27;ve had fibro for over 2 years, I don&#x27;t expect the pain to completely go away after one week.  It is so effective that I was able to cut back on my pain meds for the fibro.  So much that I have 3 days worth of meds left.  Third, I \\&quot;had\\&quot; heel spurs from running marathons for over 14 years and after applying the oil to my heels a few times a day, I actually can walk without pain for the first time in years.  And, finally, YES, it works wonders for your skin.  I am 47 and started showing a few wrinkles and, again, after just one week I noticed a difference.  I also am applying the oil to my numerous surgery scars.  I don&#x27;t know if the scars have to be fairly new or not, but mine are a few years old so if all else fails, at least I will have soft skin.  I will update my review in a couple of months, but wanted to let everyone know the results I had in just one week.  Feel free to email me at irvinerunner@yahoo.com.  I hope this product works just as amazing for you as it does for me.  Take Care !!</li>
    <li> I have a 5 year old with spastic Cerebral Palsy. I can tell a huge difference in his tone after an emu oil massage. I have not added any essentials yet, I definitely plan to. I also use for muscle aches and have felt relief.&lt;br /&gt;I use on my face and absolutely love on my skin. I do have to wax more frequently as it does make my facial hair grow faster.&lt;br /&gt;I also use on my hair. I am a white girl who uses a flat iron. If I put this on the ends of my hair (sparingly) after flat ironing it takes the burnt frizzy texture out.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has degenerative disc disease and I have used this on his spine where he hurts. He has stated it relieves the pain.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> 5 stars. Best brand out of a few Emu oils I have tried over the past year. This one for my purposes has been the right fit. Scalp condition is much better since using this and hair appears to be healthier than its ever been. Much more confident.Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this for my extremely dry hands. I put this on several times a day. I don&#x27;t see much improvement in my skin. It will moisturize for a few hours and then they are dry again just like using any regular lotion. I am going to continue to use it to see if maybe it will take a little longer but its been a week now. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and a sudden loss due to hormonal imbalance.  I bought this oil last month to help me regrowth the hair I lost after reading  many possitive feedbacks from others about hair regrowth with this oil. It has been 1 month since I started using it and although I haven&#x27;t seen yet any hair regrowth, I can admit that this oil made my hair look very healthy, soft and shiny!!! I use it every second day on my scalp. I do a massage then brush the oil down my length . My hair is really moisturized now. I do not use any chemical conditioners. I leave the oil on my scalp between 2-3 hours (sometimes more)  then rinse out. Also the size of the bottle is bigger than I thought so there is still a lot of oil left  after 1 month of use:)</li>
    <li> this right here though, this right here... lol no joke this stuff has hair growing on a bald spot that didnt have hair for ten plus years. im a believer. will purchase again</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2RWQ7V0YYHS7]]Here are the results to the emu oil. I use it at night on my temple and place a satin cap on. It&#x27;s working so far! I also gave a bottle to a friend who is sick to heal her open bed sores. They were like holes and after the emu oil was placed on it everyday the holes and scaring went away. My hair was burned out by a woman who gave me a perm as a kid. I told her it was burning and she did not want to take it out. Over the years I tried every and i mean EVERYTHING! I found out about emu oil a long time ago and I was very skeptical. I finally gave in and now I will never look back. I cut all my hair off and decided to go natural and my hair thanks me for it. Well, see the video for yourself. Also the product arrived sooner than I expected. Thanks Koru Naturals</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African-American, I have relaxed hair and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks. It&#x27;s a really good moisterizer for my hair, it makes it really soft, however I recommend to use it after you&#x27;re done styling it with heat as a nice finish. I also was looking for something to thicken my edges and so far it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> First of all, I’m not bashing the product…Emu Oil is a miracle oil with dozens of uses, so I&#x27;ll keep it at 5 stars. When it comes to hair use, I learned that, with certain people (those who are prone to dandruff and/or dry scalp) such as me, the oil may cause hair fall out.  I purchased this Emu Oil after learning about the positive effects Emu Oil has on hair growth/regrowth…particularly in the frontal region, which few if any products are known to do. I regrettably used it for 2-3 weeks. I mostly used it at night before bed, but I also used it before showering or while showering on nights I didn’t use it.  It’s difficult to believe at first, but it made my hair noticeably fall out. I noticed fall-out from the first time I used it, but I figured it had to be something else, because why would Emu Oil cause hair fall out? So I looked it up and on several forums there were several people having the same experience. There were also several skeptical responses (which I almost don’t blame them), nothing with any basis. Some of the responses were, it must just seem that way because…., or it’s probably just shedding out the old hair so new hair will grow back stronger. The second response is kind of what I was thinking, which is why I used it longer then I should have (I now lean towards the whole shedding thing being a complete fallacy when it comes to any product, when something makes your hair fall out, it’s likely not good for your hair). BTW, after using Emu oil I experimented with Jamaican Black Castor Oil a few times, which made my hair fall out as well, but less than the Emu oil.  Upon doing a little more research I found out that oils aren’t great for everyone’s hair/scalp. There were several sources, one of which; according to a health article 20 Things not to do to your hair, #9 is “If you have scalp psoriasis and also dandruff then do not oil your hair. As oil is like a meal for malasezia yeast that is the causative organism for dandruff([...]r). Also “Malassezia species inhabit the skin of about 90% of adults without causing harm. Unfortunately in some people the yeast suppresses the body&#x27;s expected immune response to it allowing it to proliferate and cause a skin disorder, often without any inflammatory response” [...] I theorize if you are one of these people, putting various oils on your scalp could cause hair to fall out... for me it did.  It wasn&#x27;t permanent because it did grow back, no more no less.   Anyways, it’s good to get this info out there, because it did take some digging. Also, it’s nice to know this for those of us whose hair loss may be bacteria related, because there are probably options for us to completely neutralize further hair loss.</li>
    <li> Emu Oil is essential if you want your glowing smooth skin and youthful appearance back.  Also cleared out a few acne scars on my back. It does much more than this, read it up for yourself, fabulous stuff</li>
    <li> I am astonished.  I read the reviews and decided to order it.  I have a few psoriasis marks--red, flaky and impossible to get rid of--but this Emu oil began to work by the very next day and all the pale marks are gone and the dark red ones have lost the deep color and flakiness.  I am so happy!</li>
