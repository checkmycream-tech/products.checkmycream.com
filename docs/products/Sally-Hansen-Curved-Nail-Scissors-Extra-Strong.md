      <li>I love the Lacrosse extra strong nail sissors.</li>

      <li>Strong, simple and works as advertised.</li>
      <li>I am neutral on recommending LaCross Nail Scissors Extra Strong because :&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
      <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Right out of the box, the scissors are strangely aligned and don&#x27;t cut cleanly.</li>
      <li>They are reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>

      <li>I really miss my old scissors...  </li>
      <li>My nails are not thick at all</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t comment for the longevity of these, but so far I really like them.</li>
      <li>set is one of the better replacements I&#x27;ve gotten for the ones that go missing.</li>
      <li>These are normal weight nail scissors.</li>
      <li>They are new</li>
      <li>Very sharp and easy to use.</li>
      <li>These are identical to my very old nail scissors in looks - but they work nothing like them.  </li>
      <li>These are strong and will hopefully last for a long time.</li>
      <li>My old, now rusty, scissors were sharp and would smoothly cut my nails.  </li>
      <li>These are solid scissors and they cut really well.</li>
      <li>Was surprised when they arrived as nail scissors.</li>
      <li>They are not tight scissors.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a strong, toe nail scissor but these were not adequate enough for me.</li>
      <li>However, I was expecting something heavy duty since they are labeled as extra strong.  </li>
      <li>They are NOT sharp on the ends, nor as tapered as our existing ones.</li>
      <li>) Good for cutting finger nails, but NOT toe nails which are thicker.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are also not very sharp.</li>
      <li>These scissors are not sharp enough and difficult to nicely cut your nails</li>
      <li>no good not sharp enough to cut my toe nails bought 3 sets and all the same lucky if it can cut papper</li>

<li> /&gt;These are very solid, with no play at all whether open or closed.</li>
<li> I doubt these are going to hold up long!  </li>
<li> Also, to trim other unwanted hair on various parts of the body.</li>
<li> This product was what I expected.</li>
<li> the scissors felt a little tight and slow to move, but work very well for the price.</li>
<li> Useful for nail and cuticle cutting, as well as hair triming.</li>
<li> well cutting right across.  </li>
<li> I use the crap out of it and the tip gets fuzzy, so I use these small scissors to carefully trim the fuzz and extend the life of my favorite stylus.  </li>
<li> The package was half opened, and it looked that they have been used.</li>
<li> My husband tightened up the screw &amp; that helped a little.  </li>
<li> For now, I&#x27;ve switched to a pair of Tweezerman toenail clippers; I prefer scissors, as it&#x27;s easier to get a rounded finish to the cut, but the scissors have to be capable of actually CUTTING, which these are not.</li>
<li> I would have returned it but it was too much trouble</li>
<li> They are not comfortable to use.</li>
<li> I bought them to replace a pair of toenail scissors that were misplaced after a camping trip.  </li>
<li> Cut is ragged and uneven.</li>
<li> Not easy to cut with.</li>
<li> The scissors were an unbelievable price, but not the shipping.</li>
<li> is hard to detect.</li>
<li> Bought these to replace another pair of LaCross that were getting dull.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re so dull they slide off the nail, and it&#x27;s an effort to cut with them.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s such a pain cutting my toe nails with blunt scissors.&lt;br</li>
<li> I would recommend these for anyone with thick nails.</li>
<li> I have thick toenails and it makes it easier for me to cut them.</li>
<li> What a disappointment that manufacturers are making such clumsy, ineffective tools for this purpose!</li>
<li> LaCross Nail Scissors are dull; blades will not cut nails!</li>
<li> These work well on my children&#x27;s thin nails.  </li>
<li> I had high hopes for these nail scissors and am very disappointed.  </li>
<li> but the cut is crude; it&#x27;s hard to guide the scissors into the corners of the nails as well.  </li>
<li> These are pretty worthless, the worst nail scissors I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These scissors are okay. I thought they would be stronger but they are just okay.</li>
    <li> This scissors were exactly as described.  They are a quality product.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Disappointing.  These scissors are not sharp enough and difficult to nicely cut your nails</li>
    <li> These were  advertized as cuticle scissors. Was surprised when they arrived as nail scissors. Too heavy/thick for that. My mistake??</li>
    <li> These work well on my children&#x27;s thin nails.  The heavier set had a tendency to tear their nails and these work well cutting right across.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> LaCross Nail Scissors are dull; blades will not cut nails!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
    <li> These clippers are the perfect size. They are strong and do not slip. They work great for both my fingers and toes.</li>
    <li> I had hoped these would be smaller but they work just as they&#x27;re supposed to.  (Maybe I wanted cuticle scissors...hmmm)  I don&#x27;t actually use these on my nails, but on my capacitive stylus with mesh tip.  I use the crap out of it and the tip gets fuzzy, so I use these small scissors to carefully trim the fuzz and extend the life of my favorite stylus.  Works great.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as part of a first aid kit for my husband&#x27;s workshop.</li>
    <li> Better than anything else on the market today!!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because even though it &#x27;looked&#x27; similar in the pictures ( a downfall for buying on the net), it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.  So I used it once, didn&#x27;t work like I hoped it would and then put it in a drawer.  Very solid and sturdy scissors, just not the ones for me</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace another pair of LaCross that were getting dull. They are NOT sharp on the ends, nor as tapered as our existing ones. This is the third pair of cuticle scissors that both my husband and I use regularly. What a disappointment that manufacturers are making such clumsy, ineffective tools for this purpose!</li>
    <li> My eyebrows and nose hair have never felt better</li>
    <li> Good product with good cost. These are strong and will hopefully last for a long time. The scissors at target are the same but they cost a dollar more than these.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on &amp;#34;Extra Strong&amp;#34; hoping that would refer to the way the scissors were put together, rather than just strength of the blades. So often the two blades are not connected strongly, which allows a nail to bend between the blades rather than being cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very solid, with no play at all whether open or closed. What wiggle there is between the blades is hard to detect. If you want a pair of nail scissors that cuts where you put them, this is the set you want.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The only reason these scissors get one star from me is because I can&#x27;t give them ZERO stars, as they deserve!  These things don&#x27;t cut, they just roll off the nail when I try to use them.  I bought them to replace a pair of toenail scissors that were misplaced after a camping trip.  These simply won&#x27;t do the job.  For now, I&#x27;ve switched to a pair of Tweezerman toenail clippers; I prefer scissors, as it&#x27;s easier to get a rounded finish to the cut, but the scissors have to be capable of actually CUTTING, which these are not.</li>
    <li> They are not comfortable to use. The package was half opened, and it looked that they have been used. I would have returned it but it was too much trouble</li>
    <li> These are nice scissors I used to replace some that were lost due to TSA.  However, I was expecting something heavy duty since they are labeled as extra strong.  These are normal weight nail scissors.</li>
    <li> These are identical to my very old nail scissors in looks - but they work nothing like them.  My old, now rusty, scissors were sharp and would smoothly cut my nails.  These do not.  They feel cheaply made.  And they certainly don&#x27;t trim smoothly.  I&#x27;ll keep them for now, but I&#x27;m going to have to spend more money I guess to buy something better in the future.  I doubt these are going to hold up long!  I really miss my old scissors...  Not to be cliche, but they don&#x27;t make these like they used to!</li>
    <li> Very good scissors, strong and well designed, with curved tip. Useful for nail and cuticle cutting, as well as hair triming. They are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> These are pretty worthless, the worst nail scissors I&#x27;ve ever owned.  They&#x27;re so dull they slide off the nail, and it&#x27;s an effort to cut with them.  They&#x27;re headed for Good Will immediately.</li>
    <li> These do not cut well.  Cut is ragged and uneven.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box, the scissors are strangely aligned and don&#x27;t cut cleanly. They are also not very sharp.</li>
    <li> This product was what I expected. I would recommend it at this price to anyone. it is exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have a cat who likes to steal my nail scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is one of the better replacements I&#x27;ve gotten for the ones that go missing.</li>
    <li> They are not tight scissors.  My husband tightened up the screw &amp; that helped a little.  Would not get these again.</li>
    <li> Great product, new in package.</li>
    <li> I have used Lacross nail scissors for years and cannot find them anywhere except Amazon now. I bought 2 pairs so I will have them.  They are great for fingernails but I do not use them on toenails.</li>
    <li> I am neutral on recommending LaCross Nail Scissors Extra Strong because :&lt;br /&gt;(1) The price is much lower than the $7 to $15 charged at Walgreens, etc. for similar items.&lt;br /&gt;(2) Item is made of good quality, shiny stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;(3) Good for cutting finger nails, but NOT toe nails which are thicker.&lt;br /&gt;(4) I use it to cut the hairs inside my nose, trim my eyebrows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I like  edrugstore&#x27;s prices, I recommend buying the lever-type nail clippers sold by the same seller instead. Search \\&quot;B004KRXEVQ\\&quot; or \\&quot;B004KRXC36\\&quot; on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Please click \\&quot;YES\\&quot; below this line if this review was helpful to you.</li>
    <li> Metal feels cheap.  Bought it to cut my nails.  Not easy to cut with.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for trimming eyebrows because of curved blades.</li>
    <li> These are solid scissors and they cut really well. They are new so I can&#x27;t comment for the longevity of these, but so far I really like them.</li>
    <li> Very highly recommended. After almost a year of use, they are still in great condition, and for a bargain price. Delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality nail scissors.  They are fitted properly and made durably.  They also have an intelligent curve design that makes it easier to cut your own nails. This is an excellent value.  Highly recommended as they were a nice surprise for the money.</li>
    <li> Strong, simple and works as advertised. Good value and reliable functionality. I would recommend for purchase to anyone looking for such a product.</li>
    <li> I love the Lacrosse extra strong nail sissors. I have thick toenails and it makes it easier for me to cut them. I will only buy Lacrosse nail clippers and sissors and I have never had a problem with them.. I would recommend these for anyone with thick nails.</li>
    <li> I felt good when I ordered these at $1.13 plus 2.85 shipping. The scissors were an unbelievable price, but not the shipping. I thought if I ordered two pairs, I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay shipping on the second pair. I was wrong, but I&#x27;m glad I bought them. It&#x27;s such a pain cutting my toe nails with blunt scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would have found them cheaper locally. They cut my nails OK, it&#x27;s time to throw the old ones out. I&#x27;m glad I now have nail scissors that work, wish I bought them a long time ago.</li>
    <li> no good not sharp enough to cut my toe nails bought 3 sets and all the same lucky if it can cut papper</li>
    <li> Sorry to say they were just okay.  I was looking for a strong, toe nail scissor but these were not adequate enough for me.</li>
    <li> Horrible does not cut nails.</li>
    <li> One of the best, moderately priced manicure sissies on the market</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these nail scissors and am very disappointed.  My nails are not thick at all but the cut is crude; it&#x27;s hard to guide the scissors into the corners of the nails as well.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> easy to use. Also, there is no rust even though i put them in my bathroom which a high humidity.</li>
    <li> high quality product - cheap price - very happy - buy several for all locations - not much more to say</li>
    <li> It is not a nail sissor.t is totally blunt</li>
    <li> I bought these scissors mostly to trim my mustache. Also, to trim other unwanted hair on various parts of the body. These scissors PULL a lot of hair and don&#x27;t cut a lot of FINE hair. They are junk-toy -kids scissors in my opinion. I would not recommend them to a grown up. If I had known that they were made in  S.S. Pakistan I never would have bought them!!!</li>
    <li> Item met vendor advertisement. Item arrived timely. Item was purchased as a gift. Can&#x27;t comment on durability or longevity.</li>
    <li> the scissors felt a little tight and slow to move, but work very well for the price. i was able to clip my nails quickly! so thanks!</li>
