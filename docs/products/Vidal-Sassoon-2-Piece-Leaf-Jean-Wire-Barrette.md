<ol>
      <li>Very beautiful.  </li>
      <li>These are absolutely perfect!  </li>
      <li>These barrettes are perfect!  </li>
      <li>This was a very good value.</li>
      <li>Not just functional, but beautiful.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s appeared to be a good quality barrette</li>
      <li>That being said, I was very pleased with the item.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>Very cute in your hair.</li>
      <li>Nice shape and color though.</li>
      <li>This is a good barrette if you are looking for something more decorative than functional.  </li>
      <li>these hair clips are very cute and they are very comfortable to wear......</li>
      <li>Cute, but they feel flimsy</li>
      <li>but I love these barrettes.</li>
      <li>The clasp is simple and it hold my hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>This cute but broke taking out of the packaging.  </li>
      <li>They are well made, pretty, go with just about anything, and do a good job.  </li>
      <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>It was easy to fix with a pair of pliers</li>
      <li>These are perfect for adding  a little flair to  up-do&#x27;s &amp; ponytails,  I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
      <li>I thought perhaps I could secure them in place by picking up hair from beneath the scarf and closing the barrette over the scarf.  </li>
      <li>These are very cute, but they slip right out of my fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>most IMPORTANT - can&#x27;t hold hair very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, the only reason I bought this was that I needed something inexpensive in order to spend $25 and get free shipping.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t slide right out of my fine, straight hair!</li>
      <li>Very pretty, nice open filigree design.</li>
      <li>I am only given this a 2 star because item looks like what I ordered and nice but never got to use since barrettes will not close either in or out of hair.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t work - they slide right out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>But the finer the quality of the scarf, the more likely it is to slip away.  </li>
      <li>And I love that they are open filigree, so that the scarf [or your hair] shows inside the clip, adding a touch of elegance with the silver wire design.</li>
      <li>but this barrette broke on the first use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more just in case I can&#x27;t reorder later.</li>
      <li>Style is pretty and made well, just not holding the hair as needed.</li>
      <li>These are so pretty, however they are more for hair decoration rather than holding the hair back.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast, too!</li>
      <li>Work great on thick hair.</li>
      <li>They are light to wear and look very classy but not too much.  </li>
      <li>Shipped fast</li>
      <li>or if I just have too much hair for it.</li>
      <li>they look stylish and can be dressed up or down</li>
      <li>It is adequate, and I finally learned that this type of barette is called a tign  boule (the snap close bar style barette).  </li>
      <li>Should have listen to reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller than expect - but still have a good size .&lt;br /&gt;Poorly constructed - 1 of them was broken in 2 places - and there are sign of erosion</li>
      <li>There is one for the right and one for the left.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised when it arrived</li>

<li> I have recently begun wearing silk scarves, gathered and tied as wide headbands.  </li>
<li> Sadly, like most the other reviewers have said, these do not close or stay closed.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re pretty enough (for not being sterling silver, but painted with something silver looking), but VERY poorly made.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t stay closed.  </li>
<li> They won&#x27;t stay closed in or out of hair.</li>
<li> On one of them the sliver coating is rough and some rust spots are showing through.</li>

<li> The barretts slide out of clean or dirty haIr.</li>
<li> The other one survived and am still using.  </li>
<li> The other also fell apart soon after and had to be repaired.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re just not worth any hassle.</li>
<li> Did not hold my hair firmly in place as expected.  </li>
<li> It fits the contour of my head and lays on my hair without pulling my hair down.</li>
<li> Sturdy and the barrette is tight.</li>
<li> Too bad, because it is a pretty style!</li>
<li> It will not clip on a thick section of hair.  </li>
<li> I do have thick hair</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is poor quality</li>
<li> Works for thick hair!</li>
<li> This is disappointing for me.  </li>
<li> These are horrible.</li>

    <li> Cute, but they feel flimsy</li>
    <li> These barrettes are perfect!  I did not realize there were 2 until the shipment arrives.  There is one for the right and one for the left.  They are light to wear and look very classy but not too much.  Shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> These are very cute, but they slip right out of my fine, straight hair. I will try using a lot of hairspray over them and see if that keeps them in</li>
    <li> These are horrible. They won&#x27;t stay closed in or out of hair. On one of them the sliver coating is rough and some rust spots are showing through. I hope my husband can bend the clasp just a bit so it can close and I can wear it.</li>
    <li> This was a very good value. I was surprised when it arrived I thought I have to end up throwing it out but I love these barrettes. The clasp is simple and it hold my hair perfectly. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and the barrette is tight. It fits the contour of my head and lays on my hair without pulling my hair down. I&#x27;m ordering more just in case I can&#x27;t reorder later.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work - they slide right out of my hair.  I wear hair clips all the time but these just don&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Very pretty, nice open filigree design. I have rated it a 2due to the fact that one barrette  clasp part arrived  disconnected. It was easy to fix with a pair of pliers but I should not have had to deal with the problem. The other also fell apart soon after and had to be repaired.</li>

    <li> This is a good barrette if you are looking for something more decorative than functional.  I do have thick hair but this barrette broke on the first use.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is poor quality or if I just have too much hair for it.</li>
    <li> Wire barrette is flimsy.  Doesn&#x27;t stay closed.  Not well made, and the barrette doesn&#x27;t grip your hair.  Too bad, because it is a pretty style!</li>
    <li> The barretts slide out of clean or dirty haIr. It will not clip on a thick section of hair.  Style is pretty and made well, just not holding the hair as needed.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this hair pin, because some of the reviewers say it&#x27;s poorly made and doesn&#x27;t hold very well. But it&#x27;s appeared to be a good quality barrette, I got lots of compliments on it! Works for thick hair! Worth the price! The shipping was fast, too!</li>
    <li> Work great on thick hair.</li>
    <li> I am only given this a 2 star because item looks like what I ordered and nice but never got to use since barrettes will not close either in or out of hair.</li>
    <li> These are so pretty, however they are more for hair decoration rather than holding the hair back. They tend to slip out of my hair when used just as barrettes. These are perfect for adding  a little flair to  up-do&#x27;s &amp; ponytails,  I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>

    <li> It is adequate, and I finally learned that this type of barette is called a tign  boule (the snap close bar style barette).  I thought I was going to get two; I did get two packages with two each in them for a total of four.  One was all I needed, but description did say two.</li>
