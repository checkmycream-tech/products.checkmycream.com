    <li> One of my best choices. Better that the new one.</li>
    <li> excellent product, good quality.</li>
    <li> Excellent scent and price (better than major NYC department stores).</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Same thing you get in the department stores.</li>
    <li> Over all smells really nice! Stays on my skin for almost 6 hours maybe. It&#x27;s a nice scent I&#x27;ve had there other fragrance before that has the gold metal hexagon cap. There both great scents! :)</li>
    <li> awesome cologne...read a lot of review on this one. decided to give it a try...wow it&#x27;s become one of my favorites so far...sweet but masculine at the same time...good projection and gotten many compliments...a must buy.</li>
    <li> I shopped around for a new scent forever.  I stumbled on this one at one of those perfume stores in the mall.  I rubbed it on to see how it smelled on the skin.  My fiance couldn&#x27;t take her nose off my neck.  We got a winner!  It was $60+ in-store so I decided to order it on Amazon.  It showed up in perfect shape (original packaging, no tears, etc).  The scent lasts a very long time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like your chick&#x27;s nose permanently attached to your neck then this isn&#x27;t the cologne for you.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best men&#x27;s cologne I have ever tried! I have received many compliments from the lady&#x27;s . The price is very reasonable for this quality cologne.</li>
    <li> MY SISTER AND HUSBAND GOT THIS FOR ME 2 YRS AGO FOR X-MAS. I AM CONFUSED NOW BETWEEN THE EAU DE TOILETTE AND COGLNE THE BOTTLE FOR COLGNE IS 3.3 OZ THE EAU DE TOILETTE IS 2.0 BUT FROM REVIEWS AM BEING TOLD COLGNE IS BETTER? ANY COMMENTS TO WHICH IS BETTER?</li>
    <li> I based my purchase on a magazine ad and reviews of other people that have bought this item. I am very pleased with the product and I must say that it does in fact smell amazing on my man of course:) It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but it is a nice hint of a nice smell. I would recommend definately.</li>
    <li> Great subtle smelling scent that, when used in moderation, will give you a barely perceptible aroma that people will really like even if they don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
    <li> I usually like men&#x27;s fragrances better than flowery light women scents...and a really like this a lot. Spicy, slightly musky but clean.</li>
    <li> Every where I go I get stop. Get crazy compliments women love this song scent. I gotten a 10 or a 9 that&#x27;s it buy it.</li>
    <li> Totally pedestrian scent. Nothing wrong with it but smells like any other in this genre, nothing special. Maybe its just not for me. Its a darker wintery scent. As others have said, just like Armani Black Code. Im giving mine away.</li>
    <li> Wow, what can I say, Yves Saint Laurent creates superb colognes.  This is for the mature man (not boys) for his date night--married or single.  Guaranteed his woman will love the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. A lot of people every where I go ask  what cologne I am wearing. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having difficulty replacing the YSF M7 product that I&#x27;ve used for years. This fills the bill nicely and at a good price!</li>
    <li> Great Service and item</li>
    <li> Smells great. Amazing product. Husband loves it. Awesome gift!</li>
    <li> Hmm nice... Smells really great and like others said surely is a lady killer. You, for sure, will receive complements on this fragrance. The only issue is the longitivity that I am not very impressed with and have different opinion with others.. It&#x27;s not bad but not great 3-4 hours at the Max and you need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;No matter what you will love the fragrance for sure!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price. I&#x27;ve wanted to try it for years, but it&#x27;s too expensive at the malls!!!</li>
