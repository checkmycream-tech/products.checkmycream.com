      <li>Easy to mount.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its easy to pick polish at a glance instead of storing polish in a drawer or container.</li>

      <li>This nail polish rack has been holding up very well.</li>
      <li>I only have just over 20 bottles of nail polish right now, which takes up about 1.5 shelves.</li>
      <li>Waiting on new ones now</li>
      <li>This is just what it looks to be and described as:  a clear acrylic set of shelves for nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was very easy to hang to the wall and holds at least 100 bottles!  </li>
      <li>first two the company sent me were broken in two different ways, but we finally got to a third one that was totally fine.</li>

    <li> Very nice and doesn&#x27;t take much space !</li>
    <li> Absolutely want another one or two. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack has been holding up very well.I have no complaints but the amount of bottles that you can fit on here will be determined by their size and shape.I do need another one because I miscalculated the number of polishes I have by a long shot.Will be ordering another!</li>
    <li> Helps to organize and visually see nuances in colors and find what you need.  Arrived beautifully packaged and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> This has worked out awesome for me!...it is very big just like the ones in the salon has room for all my polishes!...</li>
    <li> I would give this a five star but it did come with a corner piece broken off. I do love the polish rack and I want to buy another one, I have way to much polish but I need something to put them in and a plastic bin is just to tacky!</li>
    <li> The nail organizer is great, its just to small gor my collection i thought i disnt have a lot of polishes but i do so if u have a lot i would recomend you to get a bigger size than this but it is awesome and i love how it looks on my wall.</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack is smaller in person than what I judged it would be based on the picture.  It&#x27;s sturdy and very easy to mount on the wall (I used 4 wood screws).  I only have just over 20 bottles of nail polish right now, which takes up about 1.5 shelves. I&#x27;m looking forward to filling it the rest up with different polish!</li>
    <li> This shelf was exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s clear, strong, well-constructed and I was so impressed with the first one I ordered that I ordered a second one immediately. Both are in. 102-bottle capacity depends on the size of the bottles but I expected that. This was a great way to organize polish bottles and seeing them reminds me I probably don&#x27;t need another bottle of pink polish (yet!) lol</li>
    <li> I like my organizer a lot. It helps put in order without taking space and see all the colors you have. This is my second rack as is not enough. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love this rack.  Easy to put up and looks great.  Its easy to pick polish at a glance instead of storing polish in a drawer or container.</li>
    <li> I should have ordered two! This rack holds all sizes of polish bottles.</li>
    <li> I have three girls and between all four of us we had boxes of polish. I absolutely love this organizer!  It was very easy to hang to the wall and holds at least 100 bottles!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the nail room!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten rave reviews! I put it up in my bathroom and people love it and so do I!!</li>
    <li> Loved it and need to get more.</li>
    <li> Search for a long time for one that could hold a lot but was simple. I like it, but need another.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this. It looks really nice and is very sturdy.  As someone else mentioned, it would have been nice if it came with screws and plastic wall anchors.  Once I found some that fit, it was up in minutes and being filled with polish bottles!</li>
    <li> Great product, will order again.</li>
    <li> Works great held up all our nail polish. Now we need more to fill it up. Would have like it to come with wall mounting hardware.</li>
    <li> One shelf showed up scratched the other was broken. Waiting on new ones now</li>
    <li> Love it; just wish it came with hardware. Otherwise makes for a perfect organizer and fun display of my polish collection.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, exactly what I was looking for! Nothing was damaged, it&#x27;s perfect for my collection of nail polishes and I can&#x27;t wait to hang it up.</li>
    <li> Great organizer! My daughter loves it and has filled it to the max. Gets all those bottles of nail polish off her dresser and into a nice looking case and all organized.</li>
    <li> This is just what it looks to be and described as:  a clear acrylic set of shelves for nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two the company sent me were broken in two different ways, but we finally got to a third one that was totally fine. They were great about it, each time I just sent a note and a pic for verification and they shipped another. Very easy, good customer service. Frustrating that it happened twice, but how well they treated the situation was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So back to the product itself. Again, it&#x27;s as described. Nice looking, good clear and solid plastic construction. Holds all the brands I own so far regardless of shape. If it&#x27;s a standard size bottle, it should fit fine. Mounted I don&#x27;t have any worries about it holding things up, seems the shelves are going to be long reliable. But supply your own screws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good acrylic polish wrack. What you see is what it is.</li>
    <li> Beautiful design! Packaged perfect! It fits all my nail polish!!! I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> The best!!!! Love it and the customer service at the supply store is the best!!!</li>
    <li> The rack arrived broken in the bottom right corner.  I tried to contact the seller twice by email and I did not get a response.  I wanted to return it for another one.  After some time I decided to try to glue it and it was a disaster.  Now I have a product that looks awful.  We ended up hanging it on the wall anyway and we put a plant in the corner to camouflage the damaged end.  Also- we cannot put nailpolish on the bottom rack beause it wont hold the weight.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> ordered 2 they worked great, only complaint is 1 of them, the bottom shelf had a crack in it. So I epoxy glued it to save the trouble of returning it and waiting or another.  I still need 2 more to fit rest of my bottles. I would recommend this product for its quality and price. Also holds only 90 OPI bottles.</li>
    <li> Easy to mount.&lt;br /&gt;Holds 15 OPI/Gelish bottles per row and 17 Essie bottles per row.</li>
    <li> Just what i needed.  Holds all my polish, lip gloss,  hair oils, etc.</li>
    <li> i bought a gift for my friends! she loves it</li>
    <li> Great product, only downfall was my nailpolish rack came with a crack in it but i didn&#x27;t want to return it and wait for another one so I&#x27;m hoping no one realizes.. Fast shipping though</li>
    <li> unfortunately there was no screws or hardware included, but I was pleased with the quality of this item.</li>
