      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m planning to give this away as gifts. :)</li>
      <li>I am completely surprised but it does a really good job!</li>
      <li>These sponges work great for removing the white deodorant/antiperspirant marks you often get when putting on a sweater or any kind of top.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use and can be reused.  </li>
      <li>and I saw how easy it work.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my set of two Miss Ooops sponges about two years, and they are good as new.  </li>

      <li>the price is right!</li>
      <li>Oops products are so cutely packaged that they make great little gifts for just about anyone!  </li>
      <li>I had lot my other Miss Oops and was happy to find them on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>created this really neat fabric friendly sponge that erases those embarrassing deodorant stains.</li>
      <li>Sure, you can rub your fabric against itself to try to remove those marks, but these sponges work so much better and are fast and easy to use, especially when you&#x27;re running out the door in the morning -- and don&#x27;t want to have embarrassing white streaks all over your outfit!</li>
      <li>it was good, but this one is just so good with all colors even with Dark black!</li>
      <li>This also makes a good gift when you want just some little something.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t that there is necessarily anything magic about the sponge itself, but it is helpful to keep around since getting dressed and putting on cosmetics and underarm deodorant</li>
      <li>Works exactly as stated.  </li>
      <li>They work wonderful and are small enough to stick in your purse.  </li>
      <li>This product worked decently on surface deodorant marks however not as well on those that were &amp;#34;sweated in.&amp;#34; I recommend mostly for females who wear too much deodorant that is white before putting on their tops.</li>
      <li>They also remove most makeup and other stains that you find on your clothing at the time you think you are ready to head out the door!  </li>
      <li>These work really well.</li>
      <li>This really works.</li>
      <li>It is a short cut to removing the most obvious spills and accidents but is not an answer to all problems.</li>
      <li>When I have a stain, I go back to using a lint brush or the Lilly brush, which I bought at the same time and works a lot better:</li>
      <li>Great little tool for removing deodorant and other stains that haven&#x27;t set.</li>
      <li>Awesome for deodorant marks on black or navy blue dark clothing !</li>
      <li>highly recommend and</li>
      <li>I order a pack of these every few months, and my husband and I both love them.  </li>
      <li>Easily removes deodorant/powder/ etc... off dark clothing.  </li>
      <li>This is my new must have item and in my purse at all times.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this item.  </li>
      <li>If you have ever been ready to leave the house and found a deodorant stain or something else on your clothes, you will find this worth 10 times what you spent.</li>
      <li>Just rub the sponge on the stain and you&#x27;re ready to go without a washing machine or a dry cleaners and without having to start dressing again when you thought you were ready to go!  </li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>little sponge is easy to use and fits in almost all purses.</li>
      <li>I love these sponges for deodorant marks - they are a little pricey but do last a while.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Well, I guess I must&#x27;ve thrown out one sponge but kept the other -- and lucky I did.</li>
      <li>I use them on my most delicate, silk shirts and they never leave a mark or any damage.</li>
      <li>Simply find the deodorant stain and rub gently.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t intensively used it, but it&#x27;s working as advertised so far.</li>
      <li>I tried it on both natural fabrics (silk and cotton), and synthetic (polyester blend), and I couldn&#x27;t get it to work well on either.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue trying it out on different stains, maybe it works really well on some and not others.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend owning several of these!</li>
      <li>They usually remove most if not all of the deodorant I perpetually get on my clothes.</li>
      <li>For the men that are trying to avoid stains on expensive dress shirts to avoid going to the dry cleaners you are probably better off switching to a clear high performance anti-perspirant.</li>
      <li>I got some pretty big white sunblock smears on a black silk shirt, and after some digging, found the sponge and decided to try it again.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s very embarrassing to have a big white stain on a dark colored shirt.</li>

<li> Perfect..really does remove those annoying white deodorant stains from dark clothing,like the price too</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and works just like it states. I love it!</li>
    <li> I read about Miss Oops in a magazine and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  It works just like it says - I have one in my gym bag, one in my travel bag, one in my purse and one in my bathroom - and I use it a LOT!</li>
    <li> Love these! I bought these as part of my bridesmaid gifts for my wedding and the girls raved about them.</li>
    <li> I have one for home and one for travel. Perfect for toothpaste or  deodorant removal. Wish they would make a travel case of it!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as stated.  Gets deodorant off of all my clothes when an accident happens.  The double pack is great - gave one to my husband.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Product works as promised and I use this item frequently to remove deodorant spots as well as other random spots (make up.)  No problems with seller, and arrived before the promised date.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges for deodorant marks - they are a little pricey but do last a while. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t that there is necessarily anything magic about the sponge itself, but it is helpful to keep around since getting dressed and putting on cosmetics and underarm deodorant can some times lead to fabric brushing up against something that leaves one feeling a bit less than looking ideal. It is a short cut to removing the most obvious spills and accidents but is not an answer to all problems.</li>
    <li> i use mine all of the time and IT WORKS. love these things and they last forever! highly recommend and the price is right!</li>

I&#x27;ll continue trying it out on different stains, maybe it works really well on some and not others.</li>
    <li> A friend brought this out to freshen a top and I saw how easy it work.  Now it goes with me when I travel!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but I am always getting deodorant stains on my clothes. And it&#x27;s very embarrassing to have a big white stain on a dark colored shirt. Well Miss Oops! created this really neat fabric friendly sponge that erases those embarrassing deodorant stains. This little sponge works like a charm. I have never seen anything like it! This is my new must have item and in my purse at all times.&lt;br /&gt;This little sponge is easy to use and fits in almost all purses. Simply find the deodorant stain and rub gently.

    <li> So glad I decided to try this.Perfect..really does remove those annoying white deodorant stains from dark clothing,like the price too</li>
    <li> I keep one of these at home and one in my office. Great little tool for removing deodorant and other stains that haven&#x27;t set.</li>
    <li> I had lot my other Miss Oops and was happy to find them on Amazon.  Can&#x27;t live without this item.  It saves considerably on dry cleaning bills.  This also makes a good gift when you want just some little something.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad these were invented! They usually remove most if not all of the deodorant I perpetually get on my clothes.</li>
    <li> Wow! This really works. I am completely surprised but it does a really good job!</li>
    <li> If you have ever been ready to leave the house and found a deodorant stain or something else on your clothes, you will find this worth 10 times what you spent. I have never seen anything like it. It will take care of most \\&quot;oops\\&quot; on your clothes saving the time of changing and the frustration of the impossible task of trying to get something like deodorant off your clothes. I bought this one as a gift. I keep one with me at all times and one at home. One of the best inventions of the modern world!    A little early to think about it but I think everyone should have one in their Christmas stocking!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for probably about three years now and still works great. I love this. Greatest invention ever! Even my husband uses it. Everyone must have this. I&#x27;m planning to give this away as gifts. :)</li>
    <li> Does the job. I haven&#x27;t intensively used it, but it&#x27;s working as advertised so far.</li>
    <li> I order a pack of these every few months, and my husband and I both love them.  They work great!!  Easily removes deodorant/powder/ etc... off dark clothing.  Also, they last a really long time.  We use them until they are falling apart.  I use them on my most delicate, silk shirts and they never leave a mark or any damage.</li>
    <li> i had one before from a different brand it it was good, but this one is just so good with all colors even with Dark black!</li>
    <li> These work really well. Always have them close by because I wear a lot of black.</li>
    <li> Awesome for deodorant marks on black or navy blue dark clothing !</li>
    <li> These sponges work great for removing the white deodorant/antiperspirant marks you often get when putting on a sweater or any kind of top. They also remove most makeup and other stains that you find on your clothing at the time you think you are ready to head out the door!  I have also used them to remove collar stains and food stains.  Keep one in your purse and you won&#x27;t have to be embarrassed by a stain on your clothing or baby food on Daddy&#x27;s tie! They can be purchased cheaper if you watch for sales but I was in a hurry and needed something practical, but cutely packages for a stocking stuffer.  They are easy to use and can be reused.  Just rub the sponge on the stain and you&#x27;re ready to go without a washing machine or a dry cleaners and without having to start dressing again when you thought you were ready to go!  It is also great for removing fresh stains on children&#x27;s clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Oops products are so cutely packaged that they make great little gifts for just about anyone!  Highly recommend owning several of these!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts but it works 100%</li>
    <li> Someone gave me these years ago - I needed replacements and found them on Amazon.  They work wonderful and are small enough to stick in your purse.  I could not do without them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my set of two Miss Ooops sponges about two years, and they are good as new.  They work perfectly for getting deodorant marks of your clothes, and work quickly and well.  Sure, you can rub your fabric against itself to try to remove those marks, but these sponges work so much better and are fast and easy to use, especially when you&#x27;re running out the door in the morning -- and don&#x27;t want to have embarrassing white streaks all over your outfit!</li>
    <li> Removes deodarant stains, makeup and more. Miracle sponge!!</li>
    <li> This product worked decently on surface deodorant marks however not as well on those that were &amp;#34;sweated in.&amp;#34; I recommend mostly for females who wear too much deodorant that is white before putting on their tops. For the men that are trying to avoid stains on expensive dress shirts to avoid going to the dry cleaners you are probably better off switching to a clear high performance anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> These little sponges work like a charm - I was skeptical at first but it truly does work without leaving any residual marks.  Excellent product.</li>
