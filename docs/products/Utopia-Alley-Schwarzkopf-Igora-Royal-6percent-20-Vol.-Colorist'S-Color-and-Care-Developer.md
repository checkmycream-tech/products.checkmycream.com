<li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s, but I have extremely stubborn gray&#x27;s.</li>

<li> With this developer, it has consistency of Elmer&#x27;s Glue or slightly thicker.</li>
<li> Thick and creamy.</li>
<li> Liquid developer runs and it was difficult to control.</li>
<li> I have attempted to order this product 2x; however, the wrong product came both times...</li>

    <li> Very good....Helps hidrate your hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my own hair for years. And years. And this is my new favorite I&#x27;ve tried all of those &#x27;sensitive&#x27; types but my scalp always itched and burned. Not with this stuff! Amazing. The smell is pretty normal for developer. Transfers color nicely. When I bleach I only do 30 minutes but always 45 minutes when I do toner/color. I&#x27;ll keep buying this!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and mix. I have a very sensitive scalp that usually burns from other developers, but not from this one. Will buy again.</li>
