<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Make sure you wash hand very well after! this works great though and fast!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy the playboy glitz sunless products, and you want something that lasts, buy the spray. This lotion literally washes right off. I think it&#x27;s more of a gradual tanner (although it doesn&#x27;t say that in the description. It definitely needs a better description!). I thought this was going to be stuff I put on and it would last for a few days, wrong. It does have good color &amp; does not smell bad though.</li>
    <li> for the most part I liked this. Smells great!  There is no gross smell like other sunless tanners. It did get me tan , but it only lasted for one day. I wish It would stay on for more then a day.  Also I have read other reviews that it moisturizes, not at all.  If it does anything it dries your skin. Other then that I liked it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good self tanner.</li>
    <li> After just one application you can tell the difference immediatly. I have fair skin and after just one time I had a base tan. Do not take hot showers it will take it all of make sure to bathe in luke warm water.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion. I don&#x27;t have a problem with streaking, but does have to be rubbed in very well. Make sure to completely wash hands after!</li>
    <li> This product has a good smell for a self-tan. This sunless tanner works really good, great color, and because it has instant bronzing in it it is easy to tell if you have missed any spots or are leaving streaks. The only downfall I noticed is if you miss a spot and add a little more and try to rub it on it flakes and starts looking dirty. When this happens I put a little regular lotion on and then take a towel and rub lightly to remove the excess sunless tanner. Overall great product! Another sunless tanner people love is FakeBake, haven&#x27;t tried it yet though.</li>
    <li> This lotion left my skin soft and streak free. My hands looked good too. Great for everyday use. Make sure that you follow the instructions.  :-D</li>
    <li> I like this product and I&#x27;ve purchased it at least twice. I like the color that it produces and especially like it because the bottle contains 10 ounces. It has gone up in price lately so I&#x27;ve purchased other similar products with regret. I will definitely purchase this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this particular product. I do and get spray tan regularly and am always testing self tanners to try and help extend the length of my tan.. This product could very well be a stand alone. I put one application on, on my legs just to test it alone and so far I LOVE it. The smell itsnt to harsh.. it&#x27;s not great but its not horrible. The color is brown and not orange. I so far have not noticed any streaking and I applied it several hours ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MUST BUY FOR SELF TANNERS</li>
    <li> I live by the playboy tanning products.This arrived on time,in perfect condition and was exactly as I expected it to be...thank you and I&#x27;ll absolutely buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> Works fast no streaks but comes off easy. Don&#x27;t wear white clothes with it on either will rub off and it&#x27;s hard to get out</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! I am a beautiful shade of brown. People keep asking if I have been tanning and I have only applied it once! I am not orange at all. The only downside I would have to say is the dry time but hey the results are incredible so it is worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Usually self tanning lotions break me out.  This hasn&#x27;t and it looks good on.</li>
    <li> Bottle looks nice in bathroom, good work of art.  Smell of this tanning lotion is good. Say yes to this product and Playboy.</li>
    <li> I have naturally pasty skin and I have tried numerous self tanners....I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. I reccomend that you apply this latex gloves doing your hands last...also do not have any contact with water after you do it for about an hour or it will come off. You&#x27;ll see a little bit come off as you shower but as you can tell you still have a naturally glowing sun kissed tan, which is noticeable. Don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate your skin when you are showering and apply moisturizer to your elbows, knees and back of your ankles..because these are the places that are most likely for the tanner to stick because of dead skin causing to it look darker in some areas. I also have sensitive skin but this product did not irritate it...it&#x27;s even good for your face too just make sure you blend it well. I hope this was helpful!</li>
    <li> I have tried many self tanners and I LOVE this one!!  It does rub off on your clothes and sheets but that is only for the first day.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Glitz sunless tanner after reading great reviews. I can say that this sunless tanner is okay but not great. I don&#x27;t think that I would use this during the summer because it&#x27;s not very dark. I use sunless tanners all year round and this would be fine during the colder months when I don&#x27;t need as much color. I wish it was darker because the smell is great. No sunless tanner smell at all. The price is also great for the amount of product that you get. The color is nice, not orange. This could work for someone who just wants a lighter tan.</li>
    <li> It give instant color so I can see where it is going which helps to avoid streaking, but it&#x27;s like putting chocolate syrup on your skin.  Also, the smell lingers even after I shower it off.</li>
    <li> my daughter recommended this product to me. its a nice product, be sure and use it as directed for an even tan look.</li>
    <li> Maybe my skin is too white for this but I wasn&#x27;t happy with the way it makes my skin look.</li>
    <li> This item claims it smells fresh, but it is much like other self tanners and somewhat stinky.  However, it is not too bad in scent.  The initial bronze color is okay, not orange.  The self tanner is not too dark, once the bronzer is washed off.  For a lower price, Loreal self tanners work and smell a bit better I think.  It is okay overall, probably won&#x27;t buy it again as I think it is a bit overpriced.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve found.  It takes immediately, so if you need to go somewhere on the spur of the moment, you can be tanned!</li>
    <li> Really nice color. Probably one of the darkest I&#x27;ve found. It also last quite a while, probably 3 to 5 days before any noticeable fading. The fading though.... Not very pleasant looking. Very blotchy. The first place it comes off is the shins, forearms, and inner legs. Also I&#x27;ve noticed peeling behind the knees and inner elbows. Buuuut if you apply once every 3 to 4 days that problem is solved. I would recommend using on the face if you have sensitive skin. I had some minor break outs that I normally would have.  The smell is nice and the self tanner smell doesn&#x27;t linger after a shower. A lot of color guard washes off in the morning but the actual color left is still very nice. I would definitely recommend, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Smells good. You see it go on, so no streaks.  Looks natural. Some washes off in shower but its a great product. I won&#x27;t buy another brand after using this one.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It has a very dark guide, almost black, so you have to be careful. It&#x27;s like a thick gel almost which I&#x27;m not too crazy about, but bc of the color it produces I deal with it. It&#x27;s best to apply with a Mit bc it will stain your hands if you do not wash it off quick enough. It does feel a little sticky until it dries, I stand in front of a fan to speed it up before dressing. Avoid water as best as possible until totally dry bc it will run off.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Works well instantly and looks good.  Mostly, the smell is great not like other sunless tan creams.  The only thing it doesn&#x27;t last long.  It rinses off and all is gone.  It&#x27;s more like a body cream one puts on before you go out. It doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 3 because after some work, I finally got it to look right. If you got time to work with it then I would recommend because the coloring is very nice. I went from light colored skin to a dark fresh looking tan.. I wish you lots of luck, if you order this product.</li>
    <li> So obsessed with this stuff. It smells good and gives a really nice color. After a while it does come off tho in a weird pattern, but that could just be me. The price is good and there is a ton of this stuff. its awesome. I love this and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many sunless tanner before, including jergens, and the loreal sublime tanning products, ranging from spray, to lotion, to wipes. I stumbled upon this product when i was just trying to spend a gift card, and it seemed pretty legitimate. once i got it, i exfoliated my entire body, and i did not put moisturizer on before the tanner. I really liked that coming out of the bottle it is a deep, rich brown and i started with my legs, moving up and rubbed it in until it was gone. instantly i could see a change in my skin color because of the bronzer in the lotion. you will see a little run off after your first shower, but the color doesn&#x27;t go away. I have used it twice so far and i&#x27;m already multiple shades darker. i really like this product and i will definitely be buying it again!!</li>
    <li> I use this mixed with a body lotion, so I get NO streaks and last a bit longer. I also add to tanning bed lotion to bake in my skin.. Great TAN year-around!! Best Product EVER</li>
    <li> Luckily this product was so cheap or I would of wanted my money back. This product smells soo bad it&#x27;s almost unusable. It takes up to an hour to dry and still then gets all over your clothes and makes you smell terrible! It comes of patchey and makes you look like you have some kind of skin disease. The only thing I didn&#x27;t hate about this product was the cute packaging which was the reason I ended up buying it regrettably. Read your reviews people!</li>
    <li> Becareful not to get it on your clothes, other then that I really like this</li>
    <li> horrible  very unhappy</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be more of a Self Tanner, then a gradual tan. The guide is really dark but you would have to put this on every day for a week to achieve one application of a real sunless tanner</li>
    <li> Love this product!  By far the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used.  I put it on twice a week for consistent color and one more time if I need a little extra color.  I recommend wearing plastic gloves to put it on so your hands don&#x27;t turn orange (I don&#x27;t use gloves to put it on my face so I make sure it goes on even).</li>
    <li> As a former tanning salon employee I am well trained in maintaining healthy skin. My favorite job was spray tanning because it eliminates the effects of harmful UV rays. Now I have something in my cabinet that gives me the great feeling of being tan and looking good, WITHOUT the high prices of a salon package. Glitz doesn&#x27;t streak, it applies smoothly and goes a long way. Smells nice. I also recommend Playboy Tan Extending Moisturizer that I apply once Glitz is dry, sleep in it overnight (don&#x27;t worry about the sheets) and everyday after shower.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 bottles of this on first order. I was a little dissappointed on how easy it is to mess uo while applying, but for the price it is a decent tan. You definitely get the color, it just takes time to make your skin look even. Its 15-30 minutes I just dont have every day. Use for special occassion only</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion with a better price than some of the other brands,so Some times I mix the more expensive ones with this to make them last longer</li>
    <li> I only needed one or two coats to get the tan that other brands do in 4 coats! The tan is brown, not orange. Best one so far.</li>
    <li> I will apply this to my skin and it does look great but it only last a until you take a shower/wash.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on my face also &amp; it looks alright.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again even tho it does not stay on the skin after wash.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t argue that it works, but be careful that it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.  I would recommend wearing this for the day and then showering really well before putting on nice clothes.</li>
    <li> I received it very fast. The lotion went on pretty easy with little to no streeking. It is very dark and isn&#x27;t for starting out with. This lotion will stain your hands and comes off very easily when you sweat and will stain your clothes. would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. I went out on a impulse buy, for this. I should have saved my money, This stuff will leave you orange and streaky.. i literally was called a oompaloompa at work. Not the &amp;#34;Golden Glow&amp;#34; I was going for. The only upside.. it smells good. But so does cake!</li>
    <li> IT GAVE A NICE INITIAL COLOR BUT DIDNT SEEM TO GIVE ME MUCH OF A TAN</li>
    <li> Nice color and smell- washes off quickly</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!  Work to much? Not to found of those UV RAYS? Maybe you just want a touch up. This product suits every ones needs.&lt;br /&gt; It stays on all day and comes off in water. Its a nice bronze color, not ORANGE!&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy with this product I bought another. My coworkers boasted about my skin tone and 3 of my friends also bought it and love it.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to wash your hands after ;)</li>
    <li> I have not had the time to put it on my whole body, however I have put it on my legs and it looks natural and because of the color you can see where you are leaving off. There is no orange at all.</li>
    <li> By far the best sunless tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used . It gives a deep bronze look which looks very natural . It gives results instantly and if used correctly over time it looks like a perfect tan ! I absolutely love this product and will continue using it ! It lasts too !</li>
    <li> Outstanding product provides natural but deep Tan.....</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;y like the smell of this lotion which deters me from using it more than the one time I already have.</li>
