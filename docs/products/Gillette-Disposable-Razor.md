      <li>great price.. best blade..</li>
      <li>Good razors great price!</li>
      <li>The razor gave me as close a shave as I have ever experienced.</li>

      <li>Great razors for a close shave.</li>
      <li>GREAT RAZORS</li>
      <li>Everything was great and without problem.</li>
      <li>They work great while they are still good.</li>
      <li>Not as good as Mach 3 Turbo disposable and very nice handle.</li>
      <li>This Sensor3 razor is very good quality, very smooth disposable shaving razor for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s good for about 4-6 shaves.</li>
      <li>I thought that these were the disposable Mach 3 razors and I was getting a good deal</li>
      <li>I was delighted to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Good price.  </li>
      <li>I bought two 8 packs because the price looked good.  </li>
      <li>Good value.  </li>
      <li>good stuff.</li>
      <li>Good razors.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me a good</li>
      <li>Not as good as Mach3 ..</li>
      <li>This seemed a good alternative.</li>
      <li>good product for the money</li>
      <li>good for the face...</li>
      <li>Good razors at a good price</li>
      <li>Good performance too.</li>
      <li>The good news is that these razors seem to be sharper than any razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>Quality handle for a disposable and good pivoting head.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a really good disposable razor, and I was hoping that the Gillette Sensor3 would be it, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
      <li>For a clean shave, these work great!</li>
      <li>very smooth great shave.</li>
      <li>but I know I do not get very many shaves out of each razor at all.</li>
      <li>Honestly, now I don&#x27;t know what I will do.</li>
      <li>The one think I liked about Sensor</li>
      <li>I know it may be overkill on $1.75 razor but liked the experiment.  </li>
      <li>Like being able to get them on Amazon.com at a good price.</li>
      <li>So here is the deal; I stopped using these kind of razors about two years ago, decided to go the route of a safety razor.  </li>
      <li>Nice product</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are a fraction of the cost of the Mach 3 Turbo&#x27;s and are equally as effective.</li>
      <li>I like it, very good products, and I highly recommend.got it within two days, and the quality is good.</li>
      <li>good value and each razor provides many comfortable shaves</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many shavers and this is clearly the best one for me!  </li>
      <li>I have noticed thus has happened more and more with Amazon sellers.</li>
      <li>I found that the price of the Disposable Razors was better than the refills.  </li>
      <li>This razor has a nicely angled grip, it is lightweight and the triple blades provide a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I will be well pleased.</li>
      <li>buy more as needed.</li>
      <li>love them.</li>
      <li>These disposable razors usually last about 2 weeks and are probably the best that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>but they work okay</li>
      <li>WAY BETTER THAN DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB</li>
      <li>So I am still looking for a better solution.</li>
      <li>For my money, the Schick&#x27;s were better.</li>
      <li>I put these on subscribe &amp; save for more cost savings.</li>
      <li>Might be better without the pivot head, so it can have more sturdiness to cut better.</li>
      <li>wife has been using these razors more and more and she loves them more than all the lady razors she has tried.</li>
      <li>The two blade Sensor Excels are better.</li>
      <li>one time use razors that were better.</li>
      <li>All beards are different but for my face the Gillette Sensor 3 does a great job at a good cost.</li>
      <li>Have been pleased with the shave that I have been getting.  </li>
      <li>I know Fusion has blade on top, but this never worked for me.  </li>
      <li>Love these razors.</li>
      <li>These razors are ok but they do not compare to the Mach 3 product that I thought I was ordering.</li>
      <li>AND THIS DOES BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM</li>
      <li>They also have a rubberized handle for a sure grip in soapy water.</li>
      <li>these are definitely not the best razors.</li>
      <li>I love this brand of razor.  </li>
      <li>My husband and son love them.</li>
      <li>Not that satisfied thought this product would shave identical to the Sensor 3 replacement heads</li>
      <li>The moisture strip goes out quickly, otherwise I love these razors!</li>
      <li>so I could enjoy more of the vacation stuff instead of the shaving stuff.  </li>
      <li>Cannot control a light razor safely.  </li>
      <li>I liked these for trying them for the first time and the price is a bit better than the retail stores.</li>
      <li>I take the blades off the disposables and put them on the original S3 handle (it is a weighted handle with a better grip).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These last twice as long as the cheaper Gillete Custom Plus blades and give a smoother shave with less irritation.</li>
    <li> I use a straight razor about 1-2 times a week to clean up between my electric shaves. The Gillette Sensor 3 is a low cost and effective razor. I have minimal nicks/cuts (usually occur after I haven&#x27;t shaved for a long time/i have thick stubble) which probably has more to do with my face and not the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor for anyone who wants to have a nice clean cut at a low cost. I put these on subscribe &amp; save for more cost savings.</li>
    <li> Better than the cheapo knock off disposables and the 8-pack is cheaper than my local grocery store per razor (they only sell 4-packs).</li>
    <li> Razors, right? What can one say.</li>
    <li> great quality. love them. good for the face...</li>
    <li> Great razors for a close shave. I&#x27;ll buy these again.</li>
    <li> This Sensor3 razor is very good quality, very smooth disposable shaving razor for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has three blades, a lubricating strip and the handle is well designed and has a solid feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very impressed that each razor will last for 7 days of shaving before it loses the sharpness. This product is well worth the price and better than similar priced disposible razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jon Green</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed in this product.  Dull blades compared to original sensor blades.  Perhaps Brazilian&lt;br /&gt;manufacturer is not up to standard.</li>
    <li> For a clean shave, these work great!</li>
    <li> I just wish the regular cartridges were this cheap, I remove these from the handles and use them on the metal handle. Such a waste, but at 50% less than cartridges...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought Gillette razors in the past but for some reason these give me razor burn if I don&#x27;t use some type of preventive lotion on. I don&#x27;t have a problem with others. Maybe the shave affects my skin different.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Mach 3 Turbo disposable and very nice handle. However, the razor head, when compared with the Schick Xtreme 3 (which I consider to be the best overall disposable) is small, which increases the time spent shaving and for some reason the possibility of nicks.</li>
    <li> Expensive and don&#x27;t last very long. They work great while they are still good.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Good value.  WAY BETTER THAN DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB</li>
    <li> Smooth and comfortable. No knicks.</li>
    <li> I do not think I am getting a super close shave with this.</li>
    <li> Ahhhhh! Their razors, They work! What more is there to say, decent value. comfortable easy to use, I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> very smooth great shave. would recommend to all my friends. shipping was also great.</li>
    <li> I use this as my travel razor set.  They give a decent enough shave, but have shown a propensity to rust unless very dry when putting back in my dauber kit.  It&#x27;s kind of a bummer to pull out the razor a couple weeks later and find it rusty.  It is probably fine for every day use and will normally go dull faster than it will rust in normal use patterns - but this was a bit of a let down.</li>
    <li> disposable? these stay sharp for a long time...</li>
    <li> Really smooth and helps shave comfortably.</li>
    <li> The price is find, the grip is fine, I think the shave is decent. I just do not know about this razor. It is just not quite five stars. I use these razors on my face and on my head. It has a good grip and the razors are sharp, but there is something about the razor that is off...I just can&#x27;t put my finger on it.</li>
    <li> Close shave....fast delivery</li>
    <li> Best disposable razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Cheap. So, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Razor burn guaranteed.</li>
    <li> These razors were just what I was looking for. I needed razors for shaving my legs (the lady shavers just don&#x27;t seem to hold up as well as the mens). The three blades are spaced far enough apart that they rinse clean easily, and each one has a protective cover for the blade.  They also have a rubberized handle for a sure grip in soapy water. The price was right for 8 razors, too!</li>
    <li> ....that i have found to get these.  apparently they are an older model.  but i like them, my face likes them, and the price they - my wallet likes them.  good stuff.</li>
    <li> For the cost of about $1.50 per razor, it&#x27;s a good deal compared to other shaving options that are out there.  Good performance too.</li>
    <li> Works pretty much like the regular Sensor3 blades. I use these blades for about 10-15 shaves before replacing.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more as needed.</li>
    <li> good value and each razor provides many comfortable shaves</li>
    <li> My husbands been looking for these razors in the supermarkets and other stores that sales razors we found them and at a great price.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these razors... I get a great shave every time. Great for men or women, any body area.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect buy. I can order it when I need it and it&#x27;s not available in all stores. Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> I shave usually every other day and weekends.  These disposable razors usually last about 2 weeks and are probably the best that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I shave both my face and head every other day. These seem to handle the additional use and don&#x27;t cause as much razor burn as some others.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like these at all.  I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Xtreme 3 for a few years.  I really like those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sensor3 blades seem to barely cut.  I have to scrape again and again to remove everything.  The handle is a little too small and feels like it&#x27;s going to fall out of my hand.  The little &amp;#34;sensitive strip&amp;#34; in front of the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to accomplish much, and takes up a lot of space in front of the blades, to the point that it&#x27;s very difficult to get my lip shaved up close to my nose.</li>
    <li> I have used these little bad boys forever and they have always cleaned me up well with little to no irritation.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. He  now refuses to use any other kind, gives him the shave he wants, every time.</li>
    <li> The good news is that these razors seem to be sharper than any razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  The bad news is that they are too small.  At first I thought that I had accidentally ordered women&#x27;s razors, but apparently not.  If you have large hands, you will not like them; otherwise, the sharpness makes that highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These were closer to the cheap dollar store disposables.  Not very good shave.  I preferred the Schick Exterem3&#x27;s which were slightly more expensive. For my money, the Schick&#x27;s were better.</li>
    <li> Blade is fine, but the amazon price of  $1.62 is not a good value and the item can be found locally for less if you shop for them.  This is an unusual thing for amazon and I don&#x27;t understand that.  I had them on subscribe and save, but dropped them when I did some comparison shopping.</li>
    <li> I liked these for trying them for the first time and the price is a bit better than the retail stores.</li>
    <li> OK, but the handle Is smaller than other disposables.  Still can&#x27;t figure out why a pack of disposable razors is cheaper than the replacement blades for the other Gillette products...</li>
    <li> All beards are different but for my face the Gillette Sensor 3 does a great job at a good cost.</li>
    <li> Great low tier Gillette razor, dose much better than its price</li>
    <li> So here is the deal; I stopped using these kind of razors about two years ago, decided to go the route of a safety razor.  This was not a dumb hipster move this was a money savings move.  I just went on vacation and wanted a razor that would be easy to pack and cut down my shave time so I could enjoy more of the vacation stuff instead of the shaving stuff.  So this razor set worked great on shaving my winter titties and belly button lint catcher area and it fared well for my face but my main issue is the blades are not close to the top of the shaving plastic area so if you have hairs that get close to the opening of your nasal area it is almost impossible to get them.  This could be because the product development team didn&#x27;t have a single male on it or they just chose not to have males test the product before releasing it for hair genocide.</li>
    <li> Great razors for a great price!</li>
    <li> I hate these!  I went from a 5 blade heavy permanent style razor that was a dream to use to these, just to save money.  These are super lightweight, hard to hold, and felt terrible when I shaved my legs.  Yes I saved money buying these instead of cartridges, but ended up tossing them.  Not cool!</li>
    <li> Flimsy. Doesn&#x27;t seem to pull through the hair. Blades do not seem to be sharp enough to glide thru and cut. Might be better without the pivot head, so it can have more sturdiness to cut better.</li>
    <li> We bought &amp;#34;Gillette Sensor3 Smooth Shave Disposable Razor 8 Count&amp;#34; and was an excellent deal on Amazon compared to other local stores. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Have been trying these in alternative to the Fusion.  The price was excessive and the five blades sometimes caused my face to look a little too rosy for my like.  This seemed a good alternative. It&#x27;s 3 blades with a comfort strip. Quality handle for a disposable and good pivoting head.  I liked the smaller head as compared to Fusion.  I had trouble getting into small areas with Fusion:  under nose and chin.  I know Fusion has blade on top, but this never worked for me.  The strip is much cheaper than the sensor excel or fusion. I was going to try the sensitive skin model with a different strip.  Wish they would upgrade the strip.  Have been pleased with the shave that I have been getting.  I get 6-9 shaves per razor.  I have been trying the trick of spraying the blades with rubbing alcohol.  This does seem to extend blade life.  I know it may be overkill on $1.75 razor but liked the experiment.  These are Loa try.&lt;br /&gt;**********&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that they changed the strip.  The current sensitive model in green not nearly as good as the aloe strips in the blue. Loved the blue model.</li>
    <li> These were purchased based upon the ones that were bought at the store but are not near as sharp .</li>
    <li> Functions as expected- lasts the usual amount of time- cuts the usual number of shaves- deciding factor for me is cost</li>
    <li> I have a subscription order for these where they ship every other month... My skin is very sensitive and requires a razor with a sharp blade that doesn&#x27;t scrape your skin.  I decided to try these Gillette Sensor 3 and am hooked on them.  I get a very close shave, no breakouts, no dull blades, and I don&#x27;t even have to shop for them because they come automatically every other month.  It&#x27;s heaven.</li>
    <li> Product works very well.</li>
    <li> I have been a wet shaver for almost 30 years, and have tried many many different styles and brands of razors over the years. I&#x27;ve found Gillette is generally the best brand for me, having experienced various results from shaving with different styles. These Sensor 3&#x27;s have resulted in the easiest, closest, most comfortable and economical shave for the money that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my face nearly every day... easily 300+ times a year. An eight pack lasts me over a year, if my wife doesn&#x27;t swipe any. I can grow a very full and thick beard in six weeks if I don&#x27;t shave. Even after shaving, my face feels like 200 grit sandpaper twelve hours later. All that being said, for disposable razors they hold up wonderfully. I got in the habit a while back of drying my razors off completely after shaving. This simple act prolonged the life of a single razor from a couple weeks to between two and three months now, and the Sensor 3&#x27;s have been the best at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using these razors more and more and she loves them more than all the lady razors she has tried. She likes the close shave it gives to her legs and underarms. More importantly she typically gets over a month out of a single razor and that is shaving two or three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a fraction of the cost of the Mach 3 Turbo&#x27;s and are equally as effective. At the time of my purchase, these were a great value at $12.99 with a $3.00 coupon at checkout. Thanks for reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPO</li>
    <li> i was looking for the disposable blades for a mach 3 but i obviously made a mistake. these are definitely not the best razors.</li>
    <li> My husband has finally found a razor he likes (this one) after 37 years of marriage.  We both were about to give up on getting him one that worked for him.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought two 8 packs because the price looked good.  I&#x27;ve been using Mach III replacement blades but I thought I&#x27;d try these.  No comparison between the two products.  The blades felt dull.  Even nicked my face with it.  First time I&#x27;ve nicked my face shaving in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll donate them to a homeless shelter and order some Mach III blades.</li>
    <li> Good razors. They&#x27;re very lightweight and not as nice of a feel as the heavy handles the take the replacement heads but it&#x27;s much less expensive to replace the whole razor here than the head on those. I shave every day and get at least a month out of one of these.</li>
    <li> Product came as described, had no visible flaws, I am happy with and I would recommend this product for purchase.</li>
    <li> Good blade life and a pretty good shave overall. These don&#x27;t burn you easily and I have yet to get any knicks or anything from them.</li>
    <li> Ok, but dull after 3-4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any nicks to my face.</li>
    <li> I usually just use cheap disposables from BJs.  Often, I go through two cheap disposables for a single shave and then discard them.  Even then, I am not happy.  So I thought I would try a quality brand and thus I got these Gillettes.  Unfortunately, I found that the shave was not as close and that there were many areas I could simply not shave down at all!  I had to do clean up with one of my cheap disposables after using the Sensor!  The one think I liked about Sensor was that they did not get hair stuck in them during usage.  But besides that, they flat out did not work on my face.  I&#x27;m sure millions of other men love them, but not me.  So I am still looking for a better solution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shavers and this is clearly the best one for me!  It shaves smoothly without cutting my skin and the handle is smaller so it fits comfortably in my hand.  As a senior citizen it is very difficult to find many items these days that work well when your hands aren&#x27;t as large and flexible as they used to be.  It is a pleasure to use this product.  Thank you for continuing to make them.  I just wish they were easier to find.  I was delighted to find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I thought that these were the disposable Mach 3 razors and I was getting a good deal but these are just Gillette&#x27;s sensor 3 razors. These still work but just not as well as the Mach 3. There is a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I use Gillette sensor 3 razors and my son uses them. They work great for us. I would recommend to anybody.</li>
    <li> good product for the money</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s quite portable if you&#x27;re travelling. And it&#x27;s good for about 4-6 shaves. It also doesn&#x27;t cause me any razor burn. Decent product, not the best shave possible however.</li>
    <li> This was a first time purchase and I am glad I did.  My husband and son love them. I would definitely re-order this Sensor3 Smooth Shave .</li>
    <li> The heads sometimes fly off if you tap it on the edge of the sink.</li>
    <li> Bad. They leave nasty razor burn even when I use extra shaving cream. They leave stubble and don&#x27;t shave all the hairs.</li>
    <li> As a woman, it shaves better than other disposable razors that you would normally find in pink, feminized packaging on the market at a cheaper price. It&#x27;s not the world&#x27;s best razor, but for the price and quantity, it&#x27;s an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> I have essential tremor.  They are too light.  Cannot control a light razor safely.  My hand cannot shake a heavy razor so easily.  Anyone else would probably like them.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for these razors, but they have failed me repeatedly.  They pull at hair fresh out of the package - a time when any razor should shine brightest.  I&#x27;ve used single blade one time use razors that were better.</li>
    <li> Not very good. The two blade Sensor Excels are better.</li>
    <li> LIKE THEM - SMOOTH SHAVE</li>
    <li> Good razors great price!</li>
    <li> I shave with disposable Sensor3&#x27;s using a non-disposable handle. I buy the disposables because the non-disposables are almost impossible to find in stores anymore. I take the blades off the disposables and put them on the original S3 handle (it is a weighted handle with a better grip).  The disposables are only 40% of the price of the non-diposable blades and they last just as long: 20 - 40 close shaves if you get your beard hot-lathered.  Buy the 8 or 14 pack, clip the blades off and voila!  You just saved a bunch of money.</li>
    <li> I will upgrade the next time for a smoother shave, I am on blood thinners and this razor is rough on my neck and causes slight bleeding.  I have not bled to death nor do I expect too, so just saying.  Beards differ from person to person so this critique is worth what you paid for it.  Do your own due diligence.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive razors</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a really good disposable razor, and I was hoping that the Gillette Sensor3 would be it, but it&#x27;s not.  It does okay, but there have been several occasions with different razors where the blade has actually scraped my skin, not cut, but scraped.  The blades also don&#x27;t last as long as other razors have.  I&#x27;ll use these up and probably go back to what I was using before.</li>
    <li> It was easy to work with this shipper. I have no complaints about them. Everything was great and without problem.</li>
    <li> I like it, very good products, and I highly recommend.got it within two days, and the quality is good. so it is not a bad choice.</li>
    <li> this is the best way to buy razors. they are cheap enough to throw away whey they get dull.  also, it you lose one, it is not a big deal!</li>
    <li> These razors must be old.  All the strips on them are worn away.  I have noticed thus has happened more and more with Amazon sellers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to add this to a shaving kit that I&#x27;m getting together for my grandson that just turned 14. Great razor!</li>
    <li> I didnt count but I know I do not get very many shaves out of each razor at all. Maybe a couple shaves and then I have to throw it out</li>
    <li> GREAT RAZORS ONE OF BEST I HAVE OWNED FOR DISPOSABLE OR NON. HAVE ALSO OWNED A COUPLE OF ELECTRIC AND THIS DOES BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM</li>
    <li> Nice little shavers, I recommend them!</li>
    <li> Works for me.  But i only use them twice and toss &#x27;em.  Having a full beard i only shave my neck occasionally.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say that I have had better for less $$$$$$</li>
    <li> These razors are ok but they do not compare to the Mach 3 product that I thought I was ordering. That&#x27;s what I get for shopping on my phone. If you have sensitive skin as I do then this is not the razor for you. I had several places of irritation after one shave with these. The product was shipped in a timely manner so there are no complaints with Amazon on delivery.</li>
    <li> The moisture strip goes out quickly, otherwise I love these razors!</li>
    <li> On the first shave, these razors are pretty good. However, I have never in my life had a set of razors lose their effectiveness so quickly. For me, these blades last approximately through the work week, but by Friday the comfort strip has turned from orange to white and the blade is noticeably dull. I actually prefer the double-bladed bics from the convenience store to these because they last much longer.</li>
    <li> Very good disposable razor.</li>
    <li> These are the worst razors I have ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they were not cheap.  I would not recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> Meh, you get what you pay for. Not good, not bad. Have to throw away after a couple of shaves anyway so who cares, right ?</li>
    <li> After much research, I&#x27;ve discovered that more technology and research goes into mens&#x27; razors than womens&#x27;, so I decided to give these a try.  They are great for shaving your legs and I would recommend them over the pricey female razors.  The moisture strip works well and the shave is close with few nicks.</li>
    <li> husband very happy with the close shave he gets from this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s feels lighter than the replacement cartridge for the metal Sensor handle but gives an excellent shave. Also the green lube strip gets worn off faster than the orange one on the replacement cartridge. The cartridge from these disposables can be detached and used on the metal Sensor handle.</li>
    <li> Having had very disappointing experiences with disposable razors in the past, I thought I&#x27;d try these just to have on hand since the price was certainy right.  Boy was I surprised when they shaved as well as my regular razor and even felt good in my hand.  And they&#x27;re about the same price of just the blades. A little but important plus is that the blade cover stays on even in my travel case. Needless to say, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> The Shavers where exactly as ordered. I find that the disposable Shavers last longer than the individual blades that one would purchase. and with that being said saves me money.  and they tend to shave me smoother as well.</li>
    <li> excellent in every way.</li>
    <li> Gillette, it is brand name. Not generic razors like bic. You hold a higher level of fines to the blade. Why then, Gillette, do you put your name on this crap? A little bit about myself, I am not by any means hairy. I don&#x27;t, or I should say can&#x27;t, grow a beard or mustache. The only place I do grow hair and occasionally shave are the armpits and the cockpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got razor burn the first time I cleaned up my face, of the 2 dozen whiskers I have, with a brand new razor. I threw it away thinking it might be my technique. No! My pits as well got razor burn. These are really horrid razors that no one should have to use. I ended up throwing them away. What a waste of money. Don&#x27;t be cheap with your razors. Honestly, now I don&#x27;t know what I will do. If I can&#x27;t trust in the name Gillette, who can I trust?</li>
    <li> GILLETTE MAKES A VERY GOOD RAZOR WHICH I USE ALL THE TIME.</li>
    <li> I did not receive same one in the picture but they work okay</li>
    <li> On time. Quality as expected</li>
    <li> i use this blade for everyday use... got it for about $11 including shipping on amazon (w/ 2 off coupon).  great price.. great price.. best blade..</li>
    <li> Exactly what was needed. I am almost totally bald and need to shave my head about once a week. Does the trick.</li>
    <li> Updated March 25, 2014. This razor has a nicely angled grip, it is lightweight and the triple blades provide a smooth shave. The only downside I found, and which I wrote about in my initial review, is that because of the way this razor flexes, some tight spots near the nose were a bit hard to get to, at least for me. Therefore, and this is the reason for the update, I subsequently tried the Gillette Mach 3. It has a bigger handle, which I feel provides a better grip without being overly bulky.  It also seems to give a faster shave than the Gillette Sensor3 and the slightly heavier flex of the Mach 3 removed the problem with the tight spot around the nose. Consequently, I gave the remaining Sensor3&#x27;s to my wife, who finds them great for her legs, and I now use the Mach 3. Problem solved!</li>
    <li> Sensor 2 works better with less strokes.  I think 3 blades offers too much surface area against the skin, not allowing the whiskers to sink into the blades as deep as the two blade model.  Thus, you need to press harder and repeat strokes more often to get the same results as the older 2 blade model.  And your face suffers for it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t grow much hair as most people mostly stubble over 2 days so these shavers work very well.  I get about 3 weeks on each razor.  I also just shave with water.  The lube strip starts to wear off after about 9 uses.</li>
    <li> These razors are of poor quality.  They have a small handle that is hard to grasp.  I have cut myself several times.  I used two razors and threw the rest out.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Mach3 .. you get what you pay for..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve figured you out Gillette!  These disposable razors are cheaper than the disposable heads themselves.  I know you want me to get hooked on a non-disposable razor handle and then pay loads for replacement heads.  I will now be extracting the heads from off of these disposables and using them.</li>
    <li> the price is good, plus subscribe and save works to save an extra buck or so and amazon coupons show up regularly too. if you want sensor3 blades, this is the best deal anywhere.</li>
    <li> Good razors at a good price</li>
    <li> Not that satisfied thought this product would shave identical to the Sensor 3 replacement heads but it wasnt that good of a shave not sharp enough.</li>
    <li> It shaves. It&#x27;s Gillette. It works.</li>
    <li> This is the worst set of blades that I ever purchased from Gillette, they are very harsh on your skin and cause irritation.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give me a good feeling~ Really bad and fake :( It&#x27;s not cheap and it seems good but it&#x27;s not</li>
    <li> Just as described. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This product works really well and is reasonably priced.  For those who like to shave in this manner, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> good cheap little razors,.</li>
    <li> These drag, not a smooth shave at all!  They feel like they are already worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I suspected they were not the genuine article.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought a few of these at my local retailer. Guess what?  Those were just as bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I will be avoiding ALL of these in the future.</li>
    <li> Great service!!!!!!!  Nice product</li>
    <li> I tried these as an alternative to buying replacement cartridges for my Gillette razor that&#x27;s just about the same style. But these do not deliver the same smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;They do not &amp;#34;flow&amp;#34; on your skin the same and the blades are not up to the standard of the replacement cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use these, then go back to buying replacements for my Gillette.</li>
    <li> blades were of poor quality&#x3D;&#x3D;basically unusable.</li>
    <li> I seem to cut myself a LOT more with these than normal razors.  Still a steal for the price though (I can handle a knick or two every now and then).  Just be careful with them, especially around the neck/adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
    <li> Much better than other brands, but nothing like their premium razors. Foot print is too small, so it is bound to cut you on every shave. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Received these a day or so ago, but I have no shaving cream, so can&#x27;t give them a true workout, but, being a bit impatient, I did a dry shave on one cheek. Since I haven&#x27;t shaved in over a week, the stubble was dense. I was amazed. The razor gave me as close a shave as I have ever experienced. Of course, being dry, it was a bit &amp;#34;pully&amp;#34; but not too uncomfortable. I can barely wait to get some cream to undergo a real shave. I&#x27;m sure I will be well pleased.</li>
    <li> These shavers work great. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> Smooth.  Love these razors.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving legs, been using them for years and occasionally try another brand but always come back to these.  Like being able to get them on Amazon.com at a good price.</li>
    <li> Will order again... Thank you!</li>
    <li> They work good only problem is the handle could use a little more grip.</li>
    <li> Although the packaging is still blue color, the shave is not blue, it is grey color, it looks like Match3</li>
    <li> After more than three months of using the Fusion Proglide I made the mistake of trying a different razor. The Sensor3 is the worst razor I&#x27;ve used in my life. It goes beyond the typical low quality razor of simply not having a close shave by also giving a horrible scraping feeling as I shaved my legs. By the end of my shower I had three nicks on my leg. I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> I buy these because I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between this model (Sensor 3) and the more expensive disposables made by Gillette. They&#x27;re not great but they get the job done for fine hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for facial hair -- get a real razor with disposable blades for that.</li>
    <li> I was looking for blades to fit my shaving handle.  I found that the price of the Disposable Razors was better than the refills.  They seem to last just as long as the refill blades, and the handle is comfortable for me.  (maybe I was lucky and found a sale)</li>
    <li> I love this brand of razor.  Having very course hair on my cheeks and neck, the cheap one blade razor doesn&#x27;t work for me.  The electric razors will also not cut through and leave a smooth shave for me.  Therefore, I rely on the Gillette Sensor 3.  This razor was reasonably priced on Amazon and is a good buy if the price is right.</li>
