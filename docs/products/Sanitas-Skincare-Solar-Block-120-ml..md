<li> I have extremely sensitive skin &amp; it doesn&#x27;t bother it in the least.</li>
<li> However, it would be difficult to wear face makeup over it due to the thickness and high mineral content, so I reserve it not for daily wear, but for when I&#x27;m out walking and need a lot of protection.</li>
<li> but it is very thick and heavy, like sunscreen you would use at the beach or pool.</li>
<li> On the thick side though so I don&#x27;t prefer it in the summer.</li>

    <li> Name is misleading! Sanitas solar block is NOT sunblock but sunscreen which is full of chemicals. 😞</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitive skin. Non greasy. Works Perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years now and love it. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and it provides my face with the sun protection it needs. I have started buying it from Amazon because it is cheaper than anywhere else I have found it. Great product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Protects and does not cause any breakouts on my skin. Order came timely as well.</li>
    <li> Sun block is something i can never go a day without! This is the best sunblock i have ever worn and I&#x27;ve tried Lot. This one is my favorite.</li>

    <li> Great coverage.  Great protection.  Very satisfied with Sanitas Skincare Solar Block!</li>
    <li> Works great!! Ben Fuchs is the compounding pharmacist who formulated this and I have found it to be one of the best and safest!</li>
    <li> This sun block is wonderful!  I am in Mexico on the beach and every day I put this on my face and chest and have not burned at all.  It feels wonderful and the protection is total.  It also does not melt and run into my eyes.</li>
    <li> not greasy, doesn&#x27;t bother my eye &amp; it doesn&#x27;t make my skin red after being in the sun.</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago in a doctor&#x27;s office. At the time I owned jet skis and put it on every morning and worked like a dream all day. Now I use all the time and I think the ingredients have even improved.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I have ever found that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It also is very natural and gentle on skin.</li>

    <li> Sanitas Solar Block is the BEST. I started using this several years ago when I developed a skin sun allergy on my face. My face burns very easily and actually gets swollen. An esthitician that I went to only used Sanitas and I bought the product directly from her. About $50.00. She has since moved, and I found another supplier ... however, still $50.00. I need a new tube (one tube lasts me about 1 year) and decided I would check out Amazon. The price on Amazon is amazing! So, ordering from here this time. Sanitas is perfect for sensitive skin and skin that burns easily. I wear it under my makeup an it is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a believer in Sanitas products and love the solar block! It leaves my skin soft and not greasy and I love that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this sun block for several years and just love it.  It keeps my face well protected from the sun.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moisturizer that has sunscreen to use daily under makeup. This product moisturizes pretty well but it is very thick and heavy, like sunscreen you would use at the beach or pool.</li>
    <li> I love this solar block.  I have been using it for over a year and will never stop!  It hydrates, it&#x27;s not greasy AT ALL, it can be worn under makeup and it leaves no white streaks.  MUCH Better than a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good - does not have a sunscreen smell that some others do and does not really make your skin look paler. It seemed too firm to apply at first, but then somehow that problem was gone - it applied very nicely. You will still have some of a sticky feeling after applying it, but I don&#x27;t know if there is a way around it with sunscreens.</li>
