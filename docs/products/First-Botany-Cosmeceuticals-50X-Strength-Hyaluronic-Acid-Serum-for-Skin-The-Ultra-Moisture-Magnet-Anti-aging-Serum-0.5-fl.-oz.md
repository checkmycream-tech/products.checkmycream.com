<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this serum a couple of days ago. The only issue I had was the packaging that was damaged during shipping. The box was pretty smashed up but the bottle was fine. the consistency of the serum was great. Not to runny. The smell wasn&#x27;t to my liking but over all very good serum. I like to use it after I shave. I know a little different use but I like the way it soothes my skin and moisturizes. I need to use it a little longer to see the effects it has but so far so good I was given this product at a reduced price in turn for a review. I hope this was helpful</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  I have very dry and sensitive skin so I need something that is moisturizing and free of chemicals - I found the perfect product.</li>
    <li> Very noticeable difference in the first application. My face was considerable more smooth and held my moisturizer in a lot better. Will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Product for review: What a GREAT product if you have dry skin. This is a great moisturizer that does not leave your hands or face feeling gross. Not only is this a great moisturizing product for your face, but legs and arms as well.....or any other area of your body that needs moisturizing. I would highly recommend this product and company for those with dry skin!</li>
    <li> I have two toned skin. Part of my face is oily and the other part of it is dry. I have trouble finding lotions that fit my skin type. I also have age spots on my face. Luckily I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet!!! This is one of the reasons why I chose this product. It is for all skin types. I love the smell and the way that it feels on my skin. I hope by continuing to use this product I will remain wrinkle free. Since I have been using this product my age spots are lightening up some. I was asked to try this product to give my honest unbiased opinion and so far I am very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> This was purchased at a reduced price to review.  I already have oily skin so it was a little oily for me. But if someone has dry skin it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I’ve never encountered such a product before. Most serums are creamy and this is more like an oil, reminiscent of an omega-3 oil. It does have a rice/grain like odor, probably due to the rice extract that’s in it. It disappears after a while. I think this product is for a certain skin type or for a very specific use. I have normal skin and live in a humid environment, so for me the serum sat on my skin and didn’t fully absorb right away, making it difficult for me to put on my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;However, for my mother who has very dry skin and a minimal routine, she LOVED it. It absorbed quickly for her and left no residue. She gets sensitive with how much Vitamin C stings and liked that this Hyaluronic acid had no stinging.&lt;br /&gt;So I’d use this product, just not as a serum. Use it if: you have dry skin (really moisturizes and gets your skin with youthful plump), in the winter, or as a final moisturizer. My mother doesn’t like a lot of steps to her routine, so this is perfect for her. She just puts this on and she’s done. I’m only giving it 4 stars as I think it’s better advertised as an oil, not a gel. Otherwise, the product works great!&lt;br /&gt;*Honest review for discounted product*</li>
    <li> I received 50X Strength Hyaluronic  Acid Serum for Skin at a greatly reduced price thru First Botany Cosmeceutials, and Eagle Eye Review Group, and Amazon, for my unbiased opinions. This opinion is my opinion, and only my opinion. I ordered this serum because I&#x27;m now middle aged an I wanted something that I could use to camoflague my smile lines. Although they are barely noticable. I&#x27;m very subconscience about them on my face.. As I age I&#x27;m blessed not to have to deal with wrinkles, crows feet, or any other signs of aging. I applied the serum to a clean face. And used it very sparingly. A few drops is all I needed. And after using it for 2 days I barely noticed the smile lines myself. I even had to stare in the mirror to notice them. It seems that the serum locked into the smile lines and gave me a smooth soft look. Which I&#x27;m truly grateful for. I&#x27;m not vein, but I love to look my best at all times.Being confident is something we as women enjoy at all times.</li>
    <li> I love to change up and make up my facial and skin regament... the 50 strength hyaluronic acid moisturizing sirum is a great smell very hydrating and a great addition to l my other skin regiments.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
    <li> the discount they gave me for doing this review and I am really enjoying the product and once this is out I definitely will buy more</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to review this product at discount as long as I gave a honest opinion. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days and can tell a difference my face was so dry and since starting this is nice and soft will continue</li>
    <li> All those little lines and wrinkles are gone! This product leaves my skin so smooth and soft! My husband asked me what new lotion I am using! if he notices, then it really works!&lt;br /&gt; Great product! Thanks</li>
    <li> I got this free in place of my opinion i have used it twice so far and I can tell a difference all ready. my skin feels well hydrated and more radiant, Id say give this a try if you have dry skin or splotchy skin really I would use it with any type of skin. its that good. it is a decent size  too will last some time.</li>
    <li> I feel like I got ripped off.  I like the product but I don&#x27;t think there is even a 30 day supply in this bottle if I used it only once per day.</li>
    <li> A very famous TV doctor (who shall remain nameless) had a dermatologist on his show who recommended hyaluronic acid for your skin. She had said that it was one of the best hydrating lotions that you could use. That&#x27;s why I jumped at the chance to test this product at a reduced price and to give my unbiased opinion. I must say that after using for a few days I have noticed a difference in the size of my pores, (they are getting smaller) and the overall texture of my skin. It does leave a protective film on your skin but that helps with make-up application. Use just a tiny little drop, it goes a long way!</li>
    <li> A little tacky but tightens up &amp; smooths skin.</li>
    <li> I just love this mosturizer, it feels amazing going on your skin.  My face feels fresh and clean, not sticky or greasy.  You only need a small amount to cover your face and neck. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with fine lines and wrinkles or uneven skin tone.  This review is done for amztrader.</li>
    <li> Loveeeee this product!!! Makes my skin feel great!!! It makes it soft and makes it feel like fresh! Does not bother my sensitive skin either!!!</li>
    <li> So far since using this, it has been a little awkward. It has the smell and appearance of liquid chicken stock. It&#x27;s a bit greasy, which when applying to the face after its clean is a turn off. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a visible difference in my skin either. It may be something you have to use for a long period of time though, but so far I am not impressed. It says you can add it to any of your favorite lotions though so maybe that would help with the weird smell? I did receive this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> It is  great and the best serum I ever try so true about the 50x strength hyaluronic it so feel so smooth to my skin that right away I notice how moisture and specially this hot humid weather make me not so dry. my skin is dry and even more dry during summer using this make me so healthy skin it make give me more extra take care of this hyaluronic acid skin more moisture giving a Youthful and Radiant Appearance to Skin. I received a discount for this product for quality testing .</li>
    <li> OMG believe this product when it says its intensive, it literally means intensive. It hydrates instantly. Its insane. Iove this serum. When it says its 5xs stronger than hyaluronic acid ots true. This will be so amazing during the winter when my skin is in the worst condition. I use this at night after cleansing and this serum brings my skin back life!!! I am so impressed. Will continue to purchase bc its worth it. Thank you for allowing me to review this product, these are my honest opinions. Give it a try, i can promise you wont regret it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now every day and my face does seem well moisturized. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in appearance, but I&#x27;m still young enough that I don&#x27;t really need anti-aging help yet! It isn&#x27;t heavy, which I appreciate especially in the hot summer months. It is also clear, so you don&#x27;t need to worry if you miss a spot and don&#x27;t rub it in all the way. The bottle is tiny, but you only need to use a little squirt to cover your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a really faint smell, I can&#x27;t quite place what it is but it is almost like curry. It&#x27;s a mild smell though, my husband didn&#x27;t notice when I asked him to smell my face! It also fades pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discounted bottle to review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I received it for free just to try it and it is wonderful!  I usually have extremely dry elbows and knees and this really has softened them- just a tiny drop in the morning and they feel hydrated all day!</li>
    <li> This Hyaluronic Acid is a great product. You can use it by itself or you can add it to your moisturizer which I really like. This product even makes your face feel smooth. I also use this on my upper chest area (which is exposed to sun) because I am started to get wrinkles from the brutal FL sun. It also has a nice light hint of fragrance!Try it you will like it! This product was discounted for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this the past couple days, and holy crap, my skin has felt wonderful! Now, I am young, only 24, but maintenance helps skin look younger, longer! This product is best to put on at night, because it is almost like a very thin film to get all the hydration into your skin and that happens over time. My face and neck just feels so much softer, and I have laugh lines and they are slowly going away! I just love it. Love love. I was given a discount fot my hinest opinion and wow. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve learned about Hyaluronic Acid abut a month ago and I am very impressed with results. Skin feels really soft and hydrated. I&#x27;m a total Fan&lt;br /&gt;This product has a 50x strength and it really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this to test and give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect with this product, but was pleasantly surprised by how light it felt on my skin. My face didn&#x27;t feel like I had any moisturizer on at all and felt great all day.</li>
    <li> Great product, very moisturizing.  Thick, making it easy to put on.  I love the way my skin feels after using this!</li>
    <li> *Disclaimer - I received these at a promotional price.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of moisturizers and facial serums and I absolutely love this!  It makes it feel like my skin is actually absorbing more of the product and or moisture than a lot of other products I have tried.  I live in CO and it is very very dry here.  No matter how much water you drink and things you apply it seems your skin is always dry.  So far with this serum my face is staying moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> Received my 50x hyaluronic acid 2 days ago and have been applying it daily. My review for for his product is that this is a great moisturizer even after 24 hours. No greasy, and a water based serum.this a good product.</li>
    <li> First Botany Cosmeceuticals 50X Strength Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin has QUICKLY made a change in my skin.  I have these white head like bumps deep beneath the upper layers of my facial skin.  Now in my early 40s and almost ten years post menopausal, I&#x27;m starting to see a change in my face.  Those bumps really stand up more and more by the day.  After using the First Botany Cosmeceuticals 50X Strength Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin with my moisturizer just twice, I can already tell a difference in the appearance of my facial skin.  I also use it with my moisturizer on my neck and chest.  The only negative is that the First Botany Cosmeceuticals 50X Strength Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin alone smells a little like beef broth, mixed with the moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
    <li> I have tried other Hyaluronic Acid serums. They were described as increasing hydration by 1000 times. This serum by First Botany retains 4000 to 5000 times moisture. WOW!  That is quite a jump! I detected no smell in the serum or on my hands-others may be different. It is so smoooooth! I was in heaven! Only 2 drops for my faces &amp; neck &amp; backs of my hands. This serum appears to be in a small bottle but I believe this will last &amp; last.  My face appears brighter &amp; a few lines are plumped up. I did receive this serum at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. So far I love it! Thank You!</li>
    <li> I was excited to have to chance to review this product. I normally don&#x27;t splurge on skin care products, they can be so expensive and so many don&#x27;t do what they say they will. I have to admit that I really like this product. I have really sensitive skin so I&#x27;m normally really picky with what products I choose. I was happily surprised that for a product that reads &amp;#34;50x&amp;#34; it was very nice and gentle. My skin feels so soft and actually has a dewy look to it! This is hard to do with harsh water and the desert heat sucking your skin dry. The one small thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it had a very faint smell to it. But once it is absorbed into your skin you can&#x27;t smell it. Loving that my skin feels smooth and silky. I&#x27;m excited to see how well this does over some time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the product is in a much smaller size. This will be a gift to someone. I&#x27;m sure she will love! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Received my package and am so excited!  Hyaluronic Acid is great for the skin.  I only used it last night and can already see a difference.  Skin care is so important, and I&#x27;m happy to report that this is exactly what anyone needs for better looking skin!  After one use!  Highly recommend.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Ultra Moisture Magnet Serum 50X Hyaluronic Acid has a unique non-equilibrium gel structure with gel domains that bounds the water tightly. The formula creates a film on the layer of the skin and transports this water over time. The 50X Strength of the Hyaluronic Acid makes it more potent and provides maximum water binding capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One single application of this HA makes the skin look a lot younger, radiant and even-toned. Using this moisturizer/serum the skin would be dramatically plumped and lifted with incredible moisture.&lt;br /&gt;This Serum is GENTLE, EFFECTIVE &amp; SAFE for all skin types; including those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vegan, Paraben-free, oil-free, no dyes, no fragrances or fillers, Oily Skin remedy&lt;br /&gt;- Rejuvenates the look of dull skin for a smoother, more even skin tone&lt;br /&gt;- Helps in fighting with the dryness /redness on face with professional hydration&lt;br /&gt;- Diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;- Fights with the dark circles under the eyes and the eye puffiness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;50x Strength Hyaluronic Acid can hold 4,000 to 5,000 times its own weight in water. As it binds water to it, the individual molecules expand. This inflation of the Serum on a molecular level helps to plump the skin. It hydrates the skin and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and gives you a healthy, plump, smooth and glowing appearance. The amazing plumping abilities of 50 x Strength Hyaluronic Acid can be demonstrated with a dried apricot. After a few hours&#x27; immersions in a beaker of the ingredient, a dried apricot will hydrate and plump back to its original shape and my wife totally swears by this product,&lt;br /&gt;wrinkle removing and prevention that is too Frankenstein like for me but what ever it takes for the bride to keep from looking like broom Hilda I good with it.</li>
    <li> For only having used this product for a day days, I can seem to already tell a difference. It has seemed to have helped dry up the oil around my nose and have left my face feeling very soft! At age 27, you feel you shouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;have&amp;#34; to used facial products. Well, let me tell you, when you are older, you will thank yourself! This serum really seems to help firm your face. It goes on nice and easy, it&#x27;s almost a gel like consistency. I will continue to use this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DISCLOSE*&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE OR AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST, UNBIASED OPINION.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin that is sensitive to certain skin products, so I was nervous to use First Botany&#x27;s 50X Strength Hyaluronic Acid Serum. However, I have nothing but positive things to say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use, the skin immediately feels plumper and better hydrated. Although the product smells similar to soy sauce (which can be a bit difficult to get used to), it fades away fast as it is quickly absorbed. The liquid is oily, but by no means does it leave your skin feeling greasy. The bottle is quite small, but just a droplet is sufficient to cover most of the face, so it will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of use, I notice my skin looking radiant, brighter, and thin wrinkles around my eyes are quickly disappearing. Could not recommend enough! I was fortunate to receive this at a small discount, but I will be purchasing this as long as my product runs out.</li>
    <li> I received the 50x Strength Hyaluronic Acid from AMZ Review Trader at a very low discounted price and I love it. Feels great on your face.</li>
