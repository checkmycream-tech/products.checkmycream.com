### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>All and all it goes on well and cleans up great!</li>
      <li>lol!</li>
      <li>This product works great.  </li>
      <li>Plastic microbeads have been found to pollute the Great Lakes which has become a substantial environmental concern.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great scrub for acne-prone skin.  </li>
      <li>You have to find what works for YOU &amp; this product works great with me.</li>
      <li>The scent it pleasant, it doesn&#x27;t over-dry my combination skin</li>
      <li>Though it cleans pores and leaves skin feel good, but doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads at all.</li>
      <li>But no one is asking the question … How in the world did you ever think these microbeads would be a good thing?</li>
      <li>If you use a face scrub, this is a good one, and you cannot beat the good deal.</li>

      <li>Needs 10% Benzoyl peroxide as well in it to make it a more rounded product.  </li>
      <li>What does eating healthy have to do with your face?</li>
      <li>Many companies, including L’Oreal, The Body Shop, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble have agreed to phase out them out.</li>
      <li>love this product.</li>
      <li>The bottle also lasts a really long time, the quantity is awesome.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months, now, and it works great to clear my face and fade my blackheads!</li>

      <li>It works great and my face is now clear of blackheads~</li>

      <li>and you will do fine.</li>
      <li>I can tell a huge difference when I forget to use it.</li>
      <li>I used this, the astringent, and then ended with the oil free moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The teenager&#x27;s in my home go thru this quickly, so nice to find a decent deal on-line...</li>
      <li>That price is amazing and on top of that I noticed a difference in our skin and especially my sons.</li>
      <li>Its just like working out, if you don&#x27;t eat healthy you wont see much changes.</li>
      <li>You know you did it right because after you wash your face and pat it with a clean towel, your face will feel fresh and tingly.</li>
      <li>If you want your moneys worth even a pack of one is worth it.</li>
      <li>You should be aware that Salicylic Acid does make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so you need to wear sunblock after using it!</li>
      <li>Fish who swallow them are not getting the nutrition they need to live a healthy life, thus impacting the whole food chain.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product, not perfect but nothing is.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this product, I saw no change.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to wash my face 2x a day, now only once.</li>
      <li>i also love the fact that it can be used on a daily basis</li>
      <li>I vowed never to use Clean and Clear again until</li>
      <li>So much so, that as he&#x27;s running on low he is sure to let me know.</li>
      <li>I subscribed and received 2 large tubes for $8.</li>
      <li>I have large poors that often gets glogged causing me to develope blackheads.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do too much for my skin, but finding skin care products that work for you is always going to be trial and error.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a whole bottle of this and didn&#x27;t notice any change in my blackheads.</li>
      <li>For many years I have attempted other products do to the fact that I could not locate Clean and Clear blackhead treament cream on the shelves at my local drug store.</li>
      <li>For further information, simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
      <li>I have fairly decent skin until you look close</li>
      <li>Research found high concentrations of plastics in U.S. lakes, particularly Lake Erie.</li>
      <li>because of this sometimes i forget to use it at all since I normally just do it in the shower.</li>
      <li>It is good enough to be used daily and really does help the pores around my nose have less blackheads!</li>
      <li>Many other products I have tried have either dried out my skin or doesn&#x27;t clean the face sufficiently, causing for my face to be sticky and oily, leading to a pimple here or there.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure to apply it everyday to prevent those blackheads from reappearing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not usually allergic to beauty products, nor is my skin the sensitive type, but I get an allergic reaction from all the C&amp;C cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>My skin was always clear and matte.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my 15 year old son and myself.</li>
      <li>The real reason for the low review is the Mircobeads.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product per the instructions for over a month now and it has done absolutely nothing for my blackheads, so I definitely cannot recommend it.</li>
      <li>Since they are my only issue I switched to a different brand and noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
      <li>Glad to hear that their use is being phased out, but I feel pretty guilty about buying this product after I learned the damage the beads can cause.</li>
      <li>I only give 4 Stars because I am not completely sure this will be effective in the long run.    </li>
      <li>For this product, drinking the 8 glasses of water and staying away from chocolate and especially peanut butter helps clear your face.</li>
      <li>Has really reduced the blackheads and the little beads inside that help get deep.</li>

<li> /&gt;Microbeads from exfoliating personal care products and toothpastes are washed down the drain after use, pass unfiltered through the sewage treatment plants and make their way into rivers and canals, resulting in plastic particle water pollution.[3]</li>
<li> Other scrubs promised the same effects, and delivered, but only for a few weeks.     </li>
<li> This might be too harsh for daily use, so I recommend using it only 2-3 times a week or less.</li>
<li> and it definitely helps just don&#x27;t expect miracles without a little effort.</li>
<li> I have only used this product for a few days.</li>
<li> My husband and I both use it daily and purchase it every few weeks.  </li>
<li> This product takes care of my black heads and minor zits that I get every now and again.</li>
<li> It has the same little beads as other scrubs, there are just less of them.    </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never gotten allergic on any other brand</li>
<li> I guess they scrub and erase for some people, but other people it just makes them break out.</li>
<li> I like it because its less abrasive than other products.     </li>
<li> These micro-particle polyethylene beads, which are less than 1mm in diameter and designed to be washed down the drain, are polluting lakes and the oceans.</li>
<li> My son is in the puberty stage, so he has pimples and black heads.</li>
<li> My face is noticeably smoother and my pores have become slightly less noticeable.    </li>
<li> If you have pores that are a little dark and notice you have some blackheads this stuff will do the trick along with blackhead strips.</li>
<li> and this is not true.</li>
<li> Its too harsh for my skin.</li>
<li> I use it everyday.</li>
<li> and I see very little results.</li>
<li> I have&#x27;d used this product in the past.</li>
<li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and doesn&#x27;t give me weird reactions.</li>
<li> It is not a good scrub for blackhead removing I think.</li>
<li> I think he&#x27;s addicted to this product</li>
<li> So I have this product in my room collecting dust and the sad thing is, I would never give it to anyone.</li>
<li> There was a dramatic change!</li>
<li> The worst part about this product for me were the little beads in the lotion.</li>
<li> Unless it&#x27;s a cold, cold winter, I never have problems with skin drying out.  </li>
<li> and i needed it badly.</li>
<li> I have some really bad acne.</li>
<li> I felt so bad for him</li>
<li> Contains Polyethylene (PE) microbeads which are very dangerous to the environment.  </li>
<li> After just a day or two my face looks terrible again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this since it has the same active ingredients as my old face wash, but its a little harsher on my skin. I used to be able to wash my face 2x a day, now only once. because of this sometimes i forget to use it at all since I normally just do it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve never purchased this product from Amazon, I&#x27;ve been using it on a regular basis for quite a while.  It&#x27;s a great scrub for acne-prone skin.  The scent it pleasant, it doesn&#x27;t over-dry my combination skin (I use it once a day) and it is affordable (only a little is necessary at a time).  You should be aware that Salicylic Acid does make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so you need to wear sunblock after using it!</li>
    <li> Shame on you for allowing microbeads in your product(s). And don’t insult my intelligence by stating that you didn’t know they would be a danger to the environment. Where did you think these microbeads would end up? These micro-particle polyethylene beads, which are less than 1mm in diameter and designed to be washed down the drain, are polluting lakes and the oceans. Fish who swallow them are not getting the nutrition they need to live a healthy life, thus impacting the whole food chain. Many companies, including L’Oreal, The Body Shop, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble have agreed to phase out them out. But no one is asking the question … How in the world did you ever think these microbeads would be a good thing? It’s shameful. Avoid products with polyethylene as one of its ingredients. Microbeads have been put in facial scrub products, bath gels and toothpastes. For further information, simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all. The consistency is way too creamy. The first time I used this product, I saw no change. The second time I used it, I again saw not one change. Before my third try, I noticed that I had pimples all over my face. The blackheads were still there and I wish I could say I saw fewer, but yeah, I would be lying. So I have this product in my room collecting dust and the sad thing is, I would never give it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It was said to be a pack of two and it was only  pack of one but oh well. it works well and i needed it badly. If you want your moneys worth even a pack of one is worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually allergic to beauty products, nor is my skin the sensitive type, but I get an allergic reaction from all the C&amp;C cleansers I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve never gotten allergic on any other brand so I have to question its composition.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, not perfect but nothing is.  I use it daily and it definitely helps just don&#x27;t expect miracles without a little effort.</li>
    <li> The teenager&#x27;s in my home go thru this quickly, so nice to find a decent deal on-line... nothing else to write about...</li>
    <li> This does work, but it does not get rid of my blackheads at all. Just makes them a little smaller and they reappear soon enough</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do too much for my skin, but finding skin care products that work for you is always going to be trial and error. The real reason for the low review is the Mircobeads. Glad to hear that their use is being phased out, but I feel pretty guilty about buying this product after I learned the damage the beads can cause.</li>
    <li> If you have pores that are a little dark and notice you have some blackheads this stuff will do the trick along with blackhead strips. This stuff doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and doesn&#x27;t give me weird reactions. The bottle also lasts a really long time, the quantity is awesome.</li>
    <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work on my face. It is not a good scrub for blackhead removing I think. Neither I saw any minimizing effect at all.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a few days. I like it because its less abrasive than other products.     It has the same little beads as other scrubs, there are just less of them.    My face is noticeably smoother and my pores have become slightly less noticeable.    I only give 4 Stars because I am not completely sure this will be effective in the long run.    Other scrubs promised the same effects, and delivered, but only for a few weeks.     I will update the review when I finish using both tubes.</li>
    <li> I think this product definitely works differently for different people. The worst part about this product for me were the little beads in the lotion. I guess they scrub and erase for some people, but other people it just makes them break out. I had pimples scattered all over my face expect for under my eyes - so basically everywhere I applied it. The pimples weren&#x27;t deep, though, just some whiteheads and medium-sized red ones. The only reason I wanted to use this was to erase my blackheads, but it gave me whiteheads and did nothing for the blackheads on my nose. I vowed never to use Clean and Clear again until - I found the sister product of this, I guess, the Continuous Control Acne Cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months, now, and it works great to clear my face and fade my blackheads! I recommend that one over this one 100%.</li>
    <li> This product is sold as a pack of 2. However, when I received it there was only ONE face wash. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> It works great and my face is now clear of blackheads~ Just make sure to apply it everyday to prevent those blackheads from reappearing!</li>
    <li> This product works great.  My husband and I both use it daily and purchase it every few weeks.  I can tell a huge difference when I forget to use it. After just a day or two my face looks terrible again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 15 year old son and myself. My son is in the puberty stage, so he has pimples and black heads. I felt so bad for him and I went hunting for a product that would help his skin. I logged on here, read the reviews, and based on them thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I subscribed and received 2 large tubes for $8. That price is amazing and on top of that I noticed a difference in our skin and especially my sons. There was a dramatic change! So much so, that as he&#x27;s running on low he is sure to let me know. I think he&#x27;s addicted to this product lol!</li>
    <li> This is a product that I use anyway, and like it.  The real plus was the excellent price, no sales tax and free shipping.  If you use a face scrub, this is a good one, and you cannot beat the good deal.</li>
    <li> Micro-scrubbers make your skin feel exfoliated and whatever the acid is in the mixture helps to remove surface clogs and open the pores to prevent the occurrence of blackheads.</li>
    <li> The effects of this were almost instant.(overnight instant). I have some really bad acne. It has gotten to the point where it is almost unbearable to even look at. But, this scrub helped me remove a lot of acne off of my face. Follow the direction as stated on the bottle and you will do fine. You know you did it right because after you wash your face and pat it with a clean towel, your face will feel fresh and tingly. Keep in mind that this worked for my skin, but the results may vary with your skin.</li>
    <li> It says \\&quot;see fewer blackheads in just two days\\&quot;   and this is not true. I can&#x27;t even see fewer blackheads in a month!!!    It doesn&#x27;t work at all and i recommend u to not buy it</li>
    <li> love this product. This product takes care of my black heads and minor zits that I get every now and again. i also love the fact that it can be used on a daily basis</li>
    <li> This product is an amazing product for my skin. When it comes to face cleansers. You have to find what works for YOU &amp; this product works great with me. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Did not help me remove blackheads. Though it cleans pores and leaves skin feel good, but doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads at all.</li>
    <li> I dont use this every day, but several times a week. Has really reduced the blackheads and the little beads inside that help get deep. I really like this and the price was great.</li>
    <li> What does eating healthy have to do with your face? Alot actually. Its just like working out, if you don&#x27;t eat healthy you wont see much changes. For this product, drinking the 8 glasses of water and staying away from chocolate and especially peanut butter helps clear your face. I also combine this product with Curel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a scam! Target lists this as a \\&quot;pack of 2\\&quot; then delivers only one!!!!! When you call Target&#x27;s 1-800 number, they don&#x27;t pick up.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. He uses it all of the time and it helps him</li>
    <li> Contains Polyethylene (PE) microbeads which are very dangerous to the environment.  From wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microbeads from exfoliating personal care products and toothpastes are washed down the drain after use, pass unfiltered through the sewage treatment plants and make their way into rivers and canals, resulting in plastic particle water pollution.[3] Plastic microbeads have been found to pollute the Great Lakes which has become a substantial environmental concern. Research found high concentrations of plastics in U.S. lakes, particularly Lake Erie. Microbeads accounted for 90 percent of these plastics.[4]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2012, the North Sea Foundation and the Plastic Soup Foundation launched an app that allows Dutch consumers to check whether personal care products contain microbeads.[5] In the summer of 2013, the United Nations Environment Programme and UK based NGO Fauna and Flora International joined the partnership to further develop the app for international audiences. The app has enjoyed great success, convincing a number of large multinationals to stop using microbeads,[6] and is available in seven languages.</li>
    <li> Needs 10% Benzoyl peroxide as well in it to make it a more rounded product.  All and all it goes on well and cleans up great!</li>
    <li> Its too harsh for my skin. It doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference at all. Trust me.</li>
    <li> I have large poors that often gets glogged causing me to develope blackheads. I have&#x27;d used this product in the past. For many years I have attempted other products do to the fact that I could not locate Clean and Clear blackhead treament cream on the shelves at my local drug store. But know that I now I can buy it online, there is no going back to fanything else.</li>
    <li> I have fairly decent skin until you look close and I have a ton of blackheads on my nose. I&#x27;ve used a whole bottle of this and didn&#x27;t notice any change in my blackheads. Since they are my only issue I switched to a different brand and noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
    <li> When using this and the blackhead clearing astringent (also from c&amp;c) I never had blackheads and my pores were invisible. I used this, the astringent, and then ended with the oil free moisturizer. My skin was always clear and matte. I was always getting compliments on my skin. This might be too harsh for daily use, so I recommend using it only 2-3 times a week or less.</li>
    <li> I use it in the shower to put it on my face and shoulders to remove the oil off my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product per the instructions for over a month now and it has done absolutely nothing for my blackheads, so I definitely cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this face wash for many years and nothing beats this product.  My pores clog easily (although I don&#x27;t have problems with lots of breakouts, thank goodness) so there&#x27;s a good ratio of beads and soap to exfoliate my skin.  Unless it&#x27;s a cold, cold winter, I never have problems with skin drying out.  Many other products I have tried have either dried out my skin or doesn&#x27;t clean the face sufficiently, causing for my face to be sticky and oily, leading to a pimple here or there.  It is good enough to be used daily and really does help the pores around my nose have less blackheads!</li>
    <li> Worked a tiny bit. Used it for a couple months now twice a day and I see very little results. I recommend trying a different product.</li>
