      <li>In actuality the color is more like a greeen...</li>
      <li>However, it may look better as an overcoat to a darker color, I will definately be trying that before I send this one to the nail polish graveyard.</li>
      <li>&amp; they really didn&#x27;t have a great selection of colors</li>
      <li>But its a light greenish color, and worked well on my friend when i painted her nails!</li>

      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>Very beautiful color, just as I expected...</li>
      <li>I have used it over Ocean Blue - which is gorgeous!</li>
      <li>beautiful when you put on white and then 4 coats of it.</li>
      <li>This is not the best color for darker skin, but I did read where one reviewer said she used it over Black Shadow.</li>
      <li>But this is not an accurate depiction of this color.</li>
      <li>Works well with my OPI led light as well as the Gelish UV light.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mermaid-ish, and not too glittery, just nice and shimmery.</li>
      <li>This color is absolutely perfect, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice bright sparkly green.  </li>
      <li>It is overall a good product.</li>
      <li>Still longer than normal, so it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I love Gelish products and I am very wild when it comes to nail color, but this one I did not like at all.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe it arrived so fast even with free shipping.</li>
      <li>All in all really fun color</li>
      <li>Is&lt;br /&gt;cheaper than CND Polish, so you may feel it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth another.</li>
      <li>I ordered this loving the blue torquiose the picture shows.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice shimmery green.  </li>
      <li>While this is a very nice green color, I gave it 4 stars because the color is not as it appears on the site.  </li>
      <li>It has just  the right amount of sparkle to make an impression.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product and received it right away.</li>
      <li>Other wise it stays on for a good week and a half.</li>
      <li>Sometimes with a pink a transparent color works well, not so much with a sparkley electric bright Aqua.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty polish, it looked more blue online even though its called mint icing.</li>
      <li>This nail gel was the exact color I was looking for and it works as well.  </li>
      <li>It is pretty</li>
      <li>This polish is really pretty, sparkely.</li>
      <li>It looks exactly how it was presented online, the seller had it to me in three days, much cheaper then what you would pay at a beauty supply store!</li>

      <li>The color is exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>color was exactly as shown.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more sheer than I would have hoped--I&#x27;m wearing four coats and there&#x27;s still a small amount of visible nail line, but the color is so gorgeous that I don&#x27;t even care.</li>
      <li>Put this color on my daughter&#x27;s nails and it is pretty, but needs a few coats to really look good.</li>
      <li>However, it is super sparkly and works well with many other colors as an overlay.</li>
      <li>The reason I&#x27;m deducting one star is that it is very transparent.  </li>
      <li>Needs 2 coats to really cover the nail well.  </li>
      <li>It is so much nicer and eye popping</li>
      <li>Kind of messy.  </li>
      <li>Its a nice color but not the green color I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>The color looks exactly like it does in the picture &amp; the bottle was in brand new conditioned like promised.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try mixing it with other colors &amp; I may like it better.</li>
      <li>I have a large Gelish collection and this was a new one for me.  </li>
      <li>Add glitter or other nail art to really make it special!</li>

      <li>It is more green than bluish but still in the turquoise hues.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> color is different on the picture</li>
    <li> Beware of this color.  It is a GREEN color very unlike the bluish color the pic represents.  You can get this color however by doing 2 coats of OCEAN wave, then a coat of this color.  The color is a sparkly hunter green.  Gelish is a very nice product and i prefer over the cnd shellac.</li>
    <li> The color of this polish is a bit more green than the picture shows, but then again the name is MINT icing.  I love the color.  It&#x27;s very mermaid-ish, and not too glittery, just nice and shimmery.</li>
    <li> This line of gelish colors are designed to be used on top of black gelish.  It&#x27;s a nice bright sparkly green.  Without a black base is a blueish green tinted base with green glitter.  It is so much nicer and eye popping layered over Black Shadow Gelish.</li>
    <li> This color is absolutely perfect, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected. It&#x27;s a nice, shimmery green-teal color. It&#x27;s a bit more sheer than I would have hoped--I&#x27;m wearing four coats and there&#x27;s still a small amount of visible nail line, but the color is so gorgeous that I don&#x27;t even care.</li>

    <li> I ordered this loving the blue torquiose the picture shows. i received it and put it on and its more of a mint green. It&#x27;s still a good color but I would have preferred the blue-er color. Also for a good coverage it takes three coats of the color. Other wise it stays on for a good week and a half. It is overall a good product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color! Very warm and summer! It looks exactly how it was presented online, the seller had it to me in three days, much cheaper then what you would pay at a beauty supply store! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> I love Gelish products and I am very wild when it comes to nail color, but this one I did not like at all. You have to put multiple coats to get the color to stand out but when it did, it looked like i had moldy fingernails. However, it may look better as an overcoat to a darker color, I will definately be trying that before I send this one to the nail polish graveyard.</li>
    <li> I love this color and so does everyone else who sees it at my house!  It&#x27;s very nice shimmery green.  I have used it over Ocean Blue - which is gorgeous! and also over Midnight Caller and some others.  My 12 year old niece loves it!  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d wear it on my hands (I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s) but it&#x27;s a great toe color for summer!  Definitely requires 3 coats.</li>
    <li> Color wasn&#x27;t as dark as pictured.</li>
    <li> Needs 2 coats to really cover the nail well.  Really pretty color..would definitely recommend it if you  like green at all.</li>
    <li> Its a nice color but not the green color I was hoping for. I should have read some of the other reviews first.</li>
    <li> Color is perfect. My daughter loves it. The color is exactly like the picture. Product is great- couldn&#x27;t find this at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It is a great color. It has just  the right amount of sparkle to make an impression. Got lots of remarks about the color.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and received it right away. I have yet to use it but its cheaper than what its sold for in the stores. I am very satisfiedLove the color too!</li>
    <li> Thank you for getting my order processed so efficiently.  I am thrilled with my purchase.  Just as it was described.</li>
    <li> color was exactly as shown.  Good polish.</li>
    <li> This polish is definitely more of a green turqoise than a blue, my 15 yr old wanted it, but when we got it home and tried it she hated it, she said it looked like seaweed.</li>
    <li> I expected a teal/turquoise per the picture, but the polish is actually green (like the name...duh!)  If you put it over ocean wave it gives you more the effect of the picture tho.  Goes on well (not real thin), long lasting, beautiful if used with other colors.</li>
    <li> This nail gel was the exact color I was looking for and it works as well.  Color as shown on the advertisement and goes on nice and stays on well.  Yeah, truth in advertising, l&#x27;m for it.</li>
    <li> The color of this polish is great! The picture however, dipicts a sky blueish color. In actuality the color is more like a greeen... Forest green be exact. The green color very fun, just not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> This polish is really pretty, sparkely. Like others have said, its more of a green than teal which was disappointing, over all, its nice.</li>
    <li> I like this color but was hoping for a few more sparkles. I was looking for the mermaid tail looking color and thought this was it, but I think it was big bang or something that I should have gotten. It is pretty but I wanted a little more green with sparkles.</li>
    <li> I was at the nail shop about to get a gel manicure &amp; they really didn&#x27;t have a great selection of colors so I decided to order a few off of amazon. I ordered the polish 2 days ago &amp; it&#x27;s already here! I can&#x27;t believe it arrived so fast even with free shipping. The color looks exactly like it does in the picture &amp; the bottle was in brand new conditioned like promised. I will be ordering more stuff from this buyer :)</li>
    <li> This color is amazing,  It has become one of my favorites.  The Gelish Harmony system is great and this color makes it fun to use.  Only comment would be to cure it a minute instead of 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> After following the directions to a T,I ended up coating it three times,smh not worth the money or time. Just a waste of time</li>
    <li> This is a great color from the Gelish line. It is vibrant and it pops on any skin color. Add glitter or other nail art to really make it special!</li>
    <li> did not burst my bubble this time  I .  had  no idea how long this polish would take to dry I had never done the gel at home,But after they dried, I kept waiting for them to chip, crack,lol, they just became loose around the edges, and this was into the third week.I will keep trying this product.  it&#x27;s worth another.</li>
    <li> Wonderful jewell tone.  It is a nice deep colour and is second only to Ocean Wave as my favourite Gelish colour.</li>
    <li> This color is a little more green in person than on my laptop, but I love it. Looks good and Gelish brand seems to be pretty good quality. I own three of their colors now.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful color, just as I expected... I had no problems with my order,and it was shipped within the estimated time!</li>
    <li> this is a great color, goes with lots of different colors and shines beautifully. a a a a a a</li>
    <li> This stuff is so great and lasts forever !!!! Last about 4 weeks on hands and almost 8 weeks on your feet !!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!! I love the color it looks great in the sun, it sparkles beautifully. I would buy this again :)</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors Gelish carries.  Don&#x27;t like the consistency of the polish....&lt;br /&gt;too runny.  Kind of messy.  CND polish is  thicker, and for me, easier to apply.  Is&lt;br /&gt;cheaper than CND Polish, so you may feel it is worth it.  Also, put on 3 coats of polish,&lt;br /&gt;instead of 2, because it is runny and not as thick.  Lasted the 2 weeks, so that was good.</li>
    <li> Color looks great and glides on easy. Works well with my OPI led light as well as the Gelish UV light.</li>
    <li> Just received my polish and it&#x27;s every bit the color I expected.  I plan on ordering the whole line of colors!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty polish, it looked more blue online even though its called mint icing. But its a light greenish color, and worked well on my friend when i painted her nails!</li>
    <li> I love this color. The polish doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other brands of gel polish. Still longer than normal, so it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> This gelish color received a four star review because it is definitely green. Like a hunter green color. So, if you were looking for turquoise or blue-green this is not for you. However, it is super sparkly and works well with many other colors as an overlay. Also it&#x27;s gelish so really other than the color issue it&#x27;s a great product that works well.</li>
    <li> Love the color but I got nail fungus.  I guess I kept it too long n kept renewing the coat n got nail fungus and it is not easy to get rid of the fungus, it&#x27;s been going on for months.</li>
    <li> I like Gelish polishes and I like this color but it is not a favorite.  No compliments on this one when I wear it but I can&#x27;t complain because it is just like the picture shows it here though mint icing is not a great name for it.  It is more green than bluish but still in the turquoise hues.</li>
    <li> the color is very pretty, greenish blue. looks metallic from far and looks sparkly from close up. only thing is that the color shrinks towards the middle of the nail even before it&#x27;s cured.</li>
    <li> While this is a very nice green color, I gave it 4 stars because the color is not as it appears on the site.  It is definitely more of an emerald green in my opinion</li>
    <li> Not one of my favorite colors and it requires 3 coats to get good coverage.  However, my 9 year old daughter likes it.  I would say it is more of a x-mas green vs. the teal the picture shows.</li>
    <li> I have a large Gelish collection and this was a new one for me.  it&#x27;s Aqua like the sea, not so mint.  The reason I&#x27;m deducting one star is that it is very transparent.  I first put down a white base layer as there was no way to achieve this color without one and then 4  coats on top to get this color to my nails! good grief!  Sometimes with a pink a transparent color works well, not so much with a sparkley electric bright Aqua.  Good quality fresh paint.  beautiful when you put on white and then 4 coats of it.</li>
    <li> This is a great polish, I love all of the gelish polishes. But this is not an accurate depiction of this color. It is much more green than the blue-turquoise in the picture. Still pretty, but not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> I love the color. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but i can&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> Put this color on my daughter&#x27;s nails and it is pretty, but needs a few coats to really look good. It is not quite as deep as the picture portrays. Good quality polish, though.</li>
    <li> but it&#x27;s more green than sample pic, 2 coats is still translucent--a third coat makes it opaque.  All in all really fun color</li>
</ol>
