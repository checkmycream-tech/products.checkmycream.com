      <li>You kind of have to rub it in a lot to not make your hair look greasy, but so worth it.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer and pairs extremely will with Camille Rose Naturals Curl Maker.</li>
      <li>First time using it but definitely better than most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>feels smooth and moisturized its not sticky or gunky goes on easy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still in search of the best moisturizing shampoo and conditioner or cleansing conditioner that does not cause my hair to snap and become brittle after it has dried.</li>
      <li>They messed up such a great product.</li>
      <li>Good for natural hair.</li>
      <li>But anyway most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried doesn&#x27;t work for me right after my hair is shampooed.</li>
      <li>but the right amount will be just magical for thirsty/damage-prone hair.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft, shiny, healthy and overall beautiful.</li>
      <li>is more of a cream than a milk, but it dries lightly and leaves your hair soft and easy to move.  </li>
      <li>It smells amazing, and makes my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>The smell I good enough to eat, yum.</li>
      <li>It makes it so nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I received this product, but the bottle wan&#x27;t completely full.</li>
      <li>The natural ingredients are a plus and the smell of cupcake frosting is nice too.</li>
      <li>So happy I finally found a product that can appropriate my hair in its current condition.</li>
      <li>Although it did perform well on my hair, I am considering other products to see which product is best for my 4a natural hair.  </li>
      <li>, it has a sweet smell, it honestly smells like vanilla icing or white icing you put on cake.</li>
      <li>Love the all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>the right consistency Lady&#x27;s Grab This Product</li>
      <li>Becoming natural has been a learning journey for me.</li>
      <li>after rinsing out my deep conditioner (shea moisture mankua honey) i apply miss jessies leave in condish this product a little bit of coconut oil and then the camille rose curl maker and my curls are poppin!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Its a great moisturizer but really needs to be sealed with a heavy oil like castor oil and shea butter.</li>
      <li>For the first time I am having great second and third day hair!</li>
      <li>First time using the product</li>
      <li>I love that it brought shine back to my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to keep buying this as I grow my hair longer! :)</li>
      <li>It can be a bit  &amp;#34;too sweet&amp;#34; smelling, if you use too much!  </li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been natural on and off for 10 years and this is it to keep my curls replenished!!!!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m positive it will work wonders in hair that has more loose curls.</li>
      <li>I wanted something that was easy to put in my hair, brushed in well and moisturized.</li>
      <li>This product really keeps moisture in my hair and makes it easy to detangle without having to reapply it the next day.</li>
      <li>and I dont think it agrees with my hair that much.</li>
      <li>I like this product, as it is really moisturizing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this product, but the bottle wan&#x27;t completely full. It&#x27;s like they missed filling up the bottle all the way to the top.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. Very thick so a little goes a long way. You will definitely get your money worth as far as quantity goes. I like this product but in my opinion I feel that this product is not moisturizing enough to use alone. I have 3b/3c long coarse hair and I live in a dry desert environment so I must have products that are moisturizing. The product has a sweet smell and does not linger at all, which I personally do not perfer. I typically use this product with the Curl Maker. The products work well together but I have to have to redo my hair every 3-4 days whereas I could typically go 5-7 days. If you live in a dry area I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff is soooo amazing!!!!! after rinsing out my deep conditioner (shea moisture mankua honey) i apply miss jessies leave in condish this product a little bit of coconut oil and then the camille rose curl maker and my curls are poppin!!!!!! there is a lot of shrinkage with my hair though...(mixed white and black) a combo of 3b and 3c mid back...but no worries....just put it up in a pinapple at night and it will strech it out. i got beautiful results...shiny not frizzy at all, and i like the big afro curly poof lol...this did not weigh it down or make it heavy at all. This mixed with the curl maker made my wash and go last 4 days!!! (which is great for my hair it usualy lasts like two)!!! plus this literally smells like buttercream frosting!! Give it try!</li>
    <li> I think this product decently moisturizes but, for me, not right after my hair is washed. But anyway most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried doesn&#x27;t work for me right after my hair is shampooed. My hair is about a 4c and is thick. I use it more sparingly now to prevent buildup because it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well after it begins to build up on your hair. I wash my hair on average about once a week.  One tip: This product may not work as well if you haven&#x27;t found a great shampoo and conditioner or cleansing conditioner as the foundation for your hair care regimen. I&#x27;m still in search of the best moisturizing shampoo and conditioner or cleansing conditioner that does not cause my hair to snap and become brittle after it has dried. Most leave-in condtioners don&#x27;t work for me either, even knot today.&lt;br /&gt; Having proper nutrition may help us all too. I&#x27;m still working on that too, Lol. Peace and blessings!  PS: If you have any ideas for me, please leave it in the comments section</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the magic in a bottle I hoped for. I have Type 3c hair so I&#x27;m positive it will work wonders in hair that has more loose curls.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a month and I dont think it agrees with my hair that much. Its too thick, as it always leaves a white film on my hair that takes a while to get rid of. I will say that it kept my hair soft, but so did the other products I was using so I wouldnt purchase this again. It might work for someone else but not me. I am a natural african american woman with 3C, 4A hair</li>
    <li> Well I will say it is very thick and I was not expecting that, it is very hard to get out of the bottle it should have came in a jar but that is all minor. I use it as a moisturizer and it works well, it has a sweet smell, it honestly smells like vanilla icing or white icing you put on cake. I would recommend it because it does leave your hair soft. I will try more products from this brand.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a whim and I already love this. I was looking for a moisturizer for my transitioning hair which tends to dry out quickly.It&#x27;s thick and spreads easily however, a little goes a long way so I use a quarter size for my thick 4b hair after I&#x27;ve dried it. It makes it so nice and soft. Bonus: it&#x27;s smells like cake batter so my hair smells delicious all day. Thinking this might be added to my staples.</li>
    <li> I love to put this even on my hair even after straightening it. It smells amazing, and makes my hair so soft. LOVE THIS!!! You kind of have to rub it in a lot to not make your hair look greasy, but so worth it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling product. Not sure its worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and pairs extremely will with Camille Rose Naturals Curl Maker.</li>
    <li> Works just like everyone has raved about. My hair loves it</li>
    <li> My hair loves  this stuff</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about three months and I am absolutely in love. Will definitely repurchase. Smells amazing (like cupcake frosting). Makes my hair soft, shiny, healthy and overall beautiful.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product for my daughter&#x27;s hair she has really curly hair I&#x27;ve tried everything until a couple of months ago I was in my local dirt cheap and they had this product for 2.00 a bottle so I grab them all and thank God that I did because this product helped my daughters hair out in so many ways it smells good and it&#x27;s not that greasy the right consistency Lady&#x27;s Grab This Product It Is Bomb!</li>
    <li> love this leave in conditioner. great product.  use it often</li>
    <li> I give the product 4 stars.  Although it did perform well on my hair, I am considering other products to see which product is best for my 4a natural hair.  Product arrived on time as promised.</li>
    <li> This did not work well on my 4a/4b low porosity hair. It caused build up so my hair felt dry soon after. The &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; scent was sickly and cheap.</li>
    <li> This product has really impressed me. I was skeptical about it for a while, but decided to give it a try. I use it as a leave-in conditioner for various styles and I pair it with the Curl Maker. My hair is consistently soft and shiny, and my style will hold for a couple of days. This product really keeps moisture in my hair and makes it easy to detangle without having to reapply it the next day. So yay for not wasting product. I&#x27;ve also noticed my hair hardly sheds when I use Camille Rose products versus any others. It definitely strengthens my hair. I will repurchase this.</li>
    <li> Great shipping speed. First time using the product and I love it.</li>
    <li> I am under my husbands sign on. hahah. However let me say this is product is everything I needed. I didn&#x27;t like pommades, gels or grease. I wanted something that was easy to put in my hair, brushed in well and moisturized. This did that to a T. I love the smell. I love that it brought shine back to my hair. I saturated my hair a little bit more than I will in the future but still my hair isn&#x27;t overly greasy. Great product.</li>
    <li> My hair is colored and natural! And it drinks this stuff up!!! How I apply this is once every night I do a twist out and use this, then wrap my hair with a scarf. After 4 days it gets greasy and built up...but other than that it is fabulous. I&#x27;ve been natural on and off for 10 years and this is it to keep my curls replenished!!!! YAY. Highly recommended. I love the smell too!</li>
    <li> I really like this product it made my hair so so soft.I have low porosity hair and those of you that are natural know what I am talking about.After I applied this to my hair I got under the hair steamer did not rinse the Moisture Milk out ,&amp;#34;oh happy day&amp;#34; love this it is a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> I am going to wait until my hair gets longer to see what happens</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot!  It can be a bit  &amp;#34;too sweet&amp;#34; smelling, if you use too much!  But overall, it is a good product!!  I will be ordering other products from this line soon to try.</li>
    <li> Firstly, let me say that this product is more of a very thick CREAM, not a milk. Milks usually come out like a high quality lotion (not the cheap, watery kinds *lol*), but due to the very thick consistency, it is hard to get the milk out of the bottle. You have to give the bottle a hard shake downward and then really squeeze the bottle which leaves a slight indentation in your bottle and the labeling is too cute for that. *lol* I&#x27;m not sure who in marketing thought it was a great idea to package this thick consistency of a milk in a bottle. If it just had to be in a bottle, a pump would be better but a jar, and marketing this product as a cream, would be ideal. I&#x27;d recommend transfering this milk to a small container or jar or getting a pump that will fit the bottle.  I have used this product on wet, damp, and dry hair. No matter which way I used it, the result was not good. When I used it on dry hair, hours later, I noticed a bit of flaking. Now, that could have been because I initially used too much. Also, on dry hair, my hair did not feel moisturized and the product was not penetrating the hair shaft which resulted in flaking. I am transitioning and have 3c hair with medium/normal porosity. I used a small amount on wet and damp hair. I noticed quite a bit of hair coming out each time I&#x27;d finger detangle or use a comb to detangle. Too much hair was coming out while using this product. I even tried diluting with water and using less but obtained the same results. I will try this product out on a small section of my daughter&#x27;s hair who is fully natural and dilute it with water and apply it on damp hair before I finally decide to give it away. However, I personally would not repurchase.  Oh, I must mention that this product DOES indeed give excellent elongation. So if you are in need of elongation, this will definitely do that. Other than that, I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> My hair LOVE this product.Good for natural hair.</li>
    <li> Becoming natural has been a learning journey for me. Trying to find products that work well also take some time. I don&#x27;t particularly care for gels so I always look for conditioners and leave-on conditioners for moisture and styling. This moisture milk is becoming one of my holy grail products! It has great slip and and a soft scent. I rake the product through my hair in sections and I don&#x27;t wash it out. For the first time I am having great second and third day hair! I have alot of shine and a soft hold. I only do wash and go&#x27;s so I do not know how this product would do for twist-outs and braid-outs. Needless to say, I will be re-ordering! For reference, I have 3c-4a hair.</li>
    <li> This hair lotion is amazing! I am a caucasian girl with shoulder length dry-end oily scalp hair. My hair tends to be thick, wavy, and it frizzes easily. My &amp;#34;first day&amp;#34; after I wash is usually a nightmare of poofy hair and my second day is optimal but my scalp gets greasy by then and it&#x27;s just a vicious cycle (lol). I bought this product last week and have been applying to damp hair before air or blow drying and I definitely notice a difference in softness and manageability! You have to be careful not to use too much or your hair will get weighed down and greasy looking but the right amount will be just magical for thirsty/damage-prone hair. I love this stuff! The natural ingredients are a plus and the smell of cupcake frosting is nice too. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep buying this as I grow my hair longer! :)</li>
    <li> is more of a cream than a milk, but it dries lightly and leaves your hair soft and easy to move.  There is no residue or flakes after it dries.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews but I am extremely impressed with this product. I&#x27;m transitioning so dealing with relaxed hair and my natural curls has been tough. Most products only moisturize my natural hair while still leaving my relaxed hair dry, but this is the first product I have tried that left both textures soft and easier to manage. It smells GREAT also. I&#x27;m going to purchase a few more bottles. So happy I finally found a product that can appropriate my hair in its current condition.</li>
    <li> While the smell was nice, the product left BAD white flakes on my hair after it dried. I would not purchase again...</li>
    <li> Loved this original formula. I wish they would go back to it. It was really great the changed the formula to sell it in target. They messed up such a great product.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I have 3c/4a hair that tends to be drier than I&#x27;d like. But Honey, as soon as I applied this to my dry hair I felt an immediate improvement. My hair feels soft and smooth. The product also smells great!!! Definitely a must if you&#x27;re natural.</li>
    <li> Since I have been natural, I buy very few products twice.  Yet, after Camille Rose nothing else will do!  This product makes my hair moisturized and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is a great light moisturizer. Refreshes curls. Makes my hair soft &amp; shiny. Smells great too. Love the all natural ingredients. This will not sit on top of your hair &amp; weigh it down. It&#x27;s great.</li>
