### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Ilove the wonderbar, best discovery ever.</li>
      <li>For best results (and faster adjustment) leave the wonderbar on your face overnight.</li>
      <li>great product!</li>
      <li>However, the product is excellent and I found myself reordering...  </li>
      <li>This has been the best cleanser I have ever used.</li>
      <li>but after that passes it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
      <li>I have loved Wonder Bar for some time.</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin flawless and smooth</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>but the Wonderbar is amazing.  </li>
      <li>This bar is amazing.</li>
      <li>and then my skin will be amazing like all the reviews said.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fortunate that I have good skin, but I believe it even better.  </li>
      <li>But given I read the reviews and only saw excellent stories, I figured it is my responsibility to share my experience.</li>
      <li>There is a healthy not greasy shine after I finish washing my face</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this bar and in 2 days my skin is so much better.</li>
      <li>I accidentally found this product on another web site and fell in love with the  my skin again.</li>
      <li>I thought okay</li>
      <li>Works better than prescription meds.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this soap.</li>
      <li>Again, I continued, thinking it&#x27;s going to get better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty good, but the dryness and break-outs have always been a problem.  </li>
      <li>I said, I have never taken the time to review anything, but after trying so many other products I have to say that the Wonderbar is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased for my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s completely fine to use according to one of the representatives of wonder bar.&lt;br</li>
      <li>my skin is smooth and supple.  </li>
      <li>and my skin is clear and bright.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my teenage son, although he is happy with the moisture it gives his face his break outs are still going on, he continues to use it after 2 weeks but doubt I will reorder</li>
      <li>and it goes on super smooth and easy.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price!</li>
      <li>Though i don&#x27;t suffer from acne, I wanted a pure and natural soap to give a good clean wash to my face in the evenings without drying it out.</li>
      <li>The first week was fine.</li>
      <li>Long lasting bar is excellent value when used as directed.  </li>
      <li>It was about the size of a complimentary soap you get in a hotel, 2 1/2&amp;#34; by 1 1/2&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>anything that works is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I did not find it was worth the money.  </li>
      <li>While $28 is a lot to splurge on a 25g bar, it is absolutely worth it.</li>
      <li>but nothing has been able to clear up my skin until this.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even need to apply a full coverage foundation because a bb cream or just wearing my skin natural was fine.</li>
      <li>*warning...if you stop using it and start up again the adjustment phase starts over again so make sure you don&#x27;t run out of this product in the middle of using it.</li>
      <li>I use the Bar only at evening with my usual serum and moisturizer, this is excellent product.</li>
      <li>We have tried light box therapy at the dermatologist ($$$$), prescriptions, food avoidance and allergy testing along with years of treatment from our Naturopath with every natural thing imaginable.</li>
      <li>Now I just have to wait for the scars to fade from having so many zits in a short time.</li>
      <li>At first, I thought my skin was having an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients in the bar; however, that was not the case.</li>
      <li>Wonder Bar is very powerful product to clarify skin, I have really nice, but sensitive skin, Wonder Bar instantly firms, clarifies, and renews appearance of mature skin.  </li>
      <li>After a month of use and no relief, I contacted the lady on the wonderbar website, she directed me to use pure jojoba oil if needed for moisture.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll never try another cleanser as long as Wonderbar is available.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the type of person to complain about things, or go on a rant, I would normally just stop using it and say, &amp;#34;Okay,</li>
      <li>The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I am always paranoid of it being sold out so fast!</li>
      <li>bonus with this soap is that not only does it clean, it exfoliates, helps keep pores small, and when you rinse it off your skin actually feels softer &amp; more moisturized than before.</li>
      <li>On the positive side, the Proactiv is starting to clear things up.</li>
      <li>I probably will have to go to the dermatologist, since I also have some dermatitis around my nose that won&#x27;t clear up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 37 years old, with periodic acne and rosacea.  </li>
      <li>I am over 40, with sensitive skin tending toward dryness.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Having sensitive skin</li>
      <li>me just say, the Wonderbar has completely changed my skin.  </li>
      <li>deep cleans my oily skin, exfoliates, and really does have a tightening effect.</li>
      <li>leaves skin feeling clean soft and a little tightness</li>
      <li>Okay, no more Cetaphil, just a tiny bit of jojoba as needed.</li>
      <li>I would pay well more for this small bar, which lasts a surprisingly long time for us, but as I said she is a teen and doesn&#x27;t use it every day, probably more like once a day or every other day and when she forgets for several days, back is the eczema.</li>
      <li>I have never used anything like this soap where it cleans my face completely and does not dry it out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 42 years old with a sudden case of cystic acne.</li>
      <li>could not believe the size of the soap for the price, have been using it and see not real difference, thought is was for the whole body until I saw the size of the bar.</li>

<li> could not believe the size of the soap for the price, have been using it and see not real difference, thought is was for the whole body until I saw the size of the bar.</li>
<li> but if you have serious problems with eczema and it does work for you it will be worth it as you must know like me</li>
<li> All of my pimples immediately dried up and my skin started to flake (That is completely normal during the adjustment period).</li>
<li> After the second week my skin was so dry and itchy, I started using Cetaphil just at night.</li>
<li> After 2 1/2 months and the worse skin condition I have ever had, I stopped using this product and went back to Proactiv (which I have not had to use since my early twenties) in an attempt to clear up the acne I now have.</li>
<li> it goes a long way.</li>
<li> Like the other reviewer I was shocked at the teeny tiny size, it is exactly the size of complimentary hotel bar soap.  </li>
<li> I love this, but the bar is so little and SO expensive.</li>
<li> Plus, I survived PMS without a single break-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The adjustment period last a few weeks and caused my skin to be very dry and cracked especially around my mouth</li>
<li> Every morning I woke up with at least one new cystic pimple.</li>
<li> However, I&#x27;d already spent the money</li>
<li> I ordered the Wonderbar because I continue to try absolutely anything that might be of help, a teenage girls with serious skin issues is heartbreaking and difficult to live with due to all the crying, complaining and low self esteem that is generated by it.  </li>
<li> While all the blemishes are not completely gone, they are dried up and the redness has gone away.</li>
<li> have notice less break outs and that it really helps with the healing, don&#x27;t have they ugly red scars marks that stay long after, my pores seem smaller and skin less oily ..</li>
<li> Nothing worked, at least not very well or for very long.  </li>
<li> The texture of my skin is dramatically smoother and softer and my pores seem much less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> tiny little bar is very expensive and really won&#x27;t last you very long...</li>
<li> They paint this little bar as a miracle worker.</li>
<li> The bar is small but the lather is thick and creamy so a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I had no idea it would be this small.  </li>
<li> If you&#x27;re not sure, TRY IT.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It is expensive, but despite its size it seems to go a long way.  </li>
<li> so I did need to apply a very plain moisturizer.</li>
<li> ZITS, ZITS, ZITS, I mean in places I never had them, all along the hairline, chin area, even around my jaws, it seems like everything this product touched on my skin broke out!</li>
<li> I always break out when the seasons change but this year has been much worse.</li>
<li> Still not happy about the cost and the size.  </li>
<li> But the bar is so expensive and so small!  </li>
<li> My 13 year old daughter has had terrible eczema on her face, neck and arms since age 3, getting much worse at age 12.</li>
<li> It is expensive for the size, but I will probably purchase it again.</li>
<li> I was shocked when I received the Wonder Bar.  </li>
<li> I did not pay attention to the dimensions and was shocked to see the size.  </li>
<li> Crazy!</li>
<li> If I would have read this review, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have spent the money and time to suffer this product!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> could not believe the size of the soap for the price, have been using it and see not real difference, thought is was for the whole body until I saw the size of the bar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 42 years old with a sudden case of cystic acne. I always break out when the seasons change but this year has been much worse. I ordered this bar and in 2 days my skin is so much better. While all the blemishes are not completely gone, they are dried up and the redness has gone away. The bar is small but the lather is thick and creamy so a little goes a long way. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> This has been the best cleanser I have ever used. I have never used anything like this soap where it cleans my face completely and does not dry it out. I look at it as a treatment not just a cleanser.</li>
    <li> I accidentally found this product on another web site and fell in love with the  my skin again. Then discovered I, could purchase it on Amazon. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I am always paranoid of it being sold out so fast!</li>
    <li> While $28 is a lot to splurge on a 25g bar, it is absolutely worth it. The bar lasted me about 3 months with one to two uses a day. It also saved me the need of purchasing a toner and daily exfoliate because all of that was included in the wonder bar. During the adjustment period, I felt a lot of tingling on my face. At first, I thought my skin was having an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients in the bar; however, that was not the case. It was merely wonder bar doing its magic on my skin. All of my pimples immediately dried up and my skin started to flake (That is completely normal during the adjustment period). It started to itch too around my eczema so I did need to apply a very plain moisturizer. That&#x27;s completely fine to use according to one of the representatives of wonder bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustment period lasted about 3 weeks for me. It will change depending on your skin type. A friend of mine went about 5 weeks into the adjustment period before her face cleared up. After three weeks for me, I saw my skin glow and there wasn&#x27;t one pimple visible. Crazy! I didn&#x27;t even need to apply a full coverage foundation because a bb cream or just wearing my skin natural was fine. My skin has never been healthier.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin flawless and smooth</li>
    <li> Clears up blemishes. Dispite  it&#x27;s size it goes a long way. I use as a mask. Lather on and leave for 1/2 hour then rinse. Works better than prescription meds.</li>
    <li> Wonder Bar is very powerful product to clarify skin, I have really nice, but sensitive skin, Wonder Bar instantly firms, clarifies, and renews appearance of mature skin.  Long lasting bar is excellent value when used as directed.  Having sensitive skin I use the Bar only at evening with my usual serum and moisturizer, this is excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have loved Wonder Bar for some time. Though i don&#x27;t suffer from acne, I wanted a pure and natural soap to give a good clean wash to my face in the evenings without drying it out. I am over 40, with sensitive skin tending toward dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus with this soap is that not only does it clean, it exfoliates, helps keep pores small, and when you rinse it off your skin actually feels softer &amp; more moisturized than before. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this, but the bar is so little and SO expensive.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap. I just wish it was cheaper and it lasted longer.  I have shared it with family.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son, although he is happy with the moisture it gives his face his break outs are still going on, he continues to use it after 2 weeks but doubt I will reorder</li>
    <li> I was shocked when I received the Wonder Bar.  I had no idea it would be this small.  It was about the size of a complimentary soap you get in a hotel, 2 1/2&amp;#34; by 1 1/2&amp;#34;.  However, I&#x27;ve been using it and I really like it.  I&#x27;m fortunate that I have good skin, but I believe it even better.  It is expensive for the size, but I will probably purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It firms... tightens...  my skin is smooth and supple.  But the bar is so expensive and so small!  It is the size of a sample given at a hotel.  I did not pay attention to the dimensions and was shocked to see the size.  However, the product is excellent and I found myself reordering...  Still not happy about the cost and the size.  But it would not be just to lower the rating for the cost of the product.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a couple weeks .. have notice less break outs and that it really helps with the healing, don&#x27;t have they ugly red scars marks that stay long after, my pores seem smaller and skin less oily .. leaves skin feeling clean soft and a little tightness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tiny little bar is very expensive and really won&#x27;t last you very long...</li>
    <li> just lathering with this soap deep cleans my oily skin, exfoliates, and really does have a tightening effect. great product!</li>
    <li> This bar is amazing. The adjustment period last a few weeks and caused my skin to be very dry and cracked especially around my mouth but after that passes it&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;ve used ever acne product on the market and even accutane but nothing has been able to clear up my skin until this. For best results (and faster adjustment) leave the wonderbar on your face overnight. *warning...if you stop using it and start up again the adjustment phase starts over again so make sure you don&#x27;t run out of this product in the middle of using it. The tiny bar lasts me about 2 months</li>
    <li> I did not find it was worth the money.  I did not see any difference in my skin.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> but the Wonderbar is amazing.  Like the other reviewer I was shocked at the teeny tiny size, it is exactly the size of complimentary hotel bar soap.  However, I&#x27;d already spent the money so I just decided I&#x27;d give it a try but never again buy a product that didn&#x27;t list a size/weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, the Wonderbar has completely changed my skin.  I&#x27;m 37 years old, with periodic acne and rosacea.  I&#x27;ve moisturized religiously since I was about 13 so wrinkle-wise I&#x27;m pretty good, but the dryness and break-outs have always been a problem.  They&#x27;re not anymore.  I&#x27;ve been using the Wonderbar for three weeks and my skin is clear and bright.  There is a healthy not greasy shine after I finish washing my face that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Plus, I survived PMS without a single break-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using a BB cream now instead of a full-on foundation and it goes on super smooth and easy.  The texture of my skin is dramatically smoother and softer and my pores seem much less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I have never taken the time to review anything, but after trying so many other products I have to say that the Wonderbar is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, but despite its size it seems to go a long way.  After three weeks my bar doesn&#x27;t seem noticbly smaller at all.  If you&#x27;re not sure, TRY IT.  I&#x27;ll never try another cleanser as long as Wonderbar is available.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews on this product before I purchased it. They paint this little bar as a miracle worker. My experience was unlike any I read. The first week was fine. I did notice tightening and a sheen appearance on my skin. I followed the directions, wash and leave on 3-5 minutes, twice a day, don&#x27;t use any moisturizers, allow the healing process to begin. After the second week my skin was so dry and itchy, I started using Cetaphil just at night. The breakouts began! Every morning I woke up with at least one new cystic pimple. I thought okay this is just the healing crisis at work, so I continued. After a month of use and no relief, I contacted the lady on the wonderbar website, she directed me to use pure jojoba oil if needed for moisture. Okay, no more Cetaphil, just a tiny bit of jojoba as needed. ZITS, ZITS, ZITS, I mean in places I never had them, all along the hairline, chin area, even around my jaws, it seems like everything this product touched on my skin broke out! Again, I continued, thinking it&#x27;s going to get better and then my skin will be amazing like all the reviews said. After 2 1/2 months and the worse skin condition I have ever had, I stopped using this product and went back to Proactiv (which I have not had to use since my early twenties) in an attempt to clear up the acne I now have. I probably will have to go to the dermatologist, since I also have some dermatitis around my nose that won&#x27;t clear up. On the positive side, the Proactiv is starting to clear things up. Now I just have to wait for the scars to fade from having so many zits in a short time. I&#x27;m not the type of person to complain about things, or go on a rant, I would normally just stop using it and say, &amp;#34;Okay, well it didn&#x27;t work for me&amp;#34;! But given I read the reviews and only saw excellent stories, I figured it is my responsibility to share my experience. If I would have read this review, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have spent the money and time to suffer this product!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter has had terrible eczema on her face, neck and arms since age 3, getting much worse at age 12. We have tried light box therapy at the dermatologist ($$$$), prescriptions, food avoidance and allergy testing along with years of treatment from our Naturopath with every natural thing imaginable. Nothing worked, at least not very well or for very long.  I ordered the Wonderbar because I continue to try absolutely anything that might be of help, a teenage girls with serious skin issues is heartbreaking and difficult to live with due to all the crying, complaining and low self esteem that is generated by it.  All I can say is that the Wonderbar is a WONDER!  The only thing that has ever worked. EVER. I would pay well more for this small bar, which lasts a surprisingly long time for us, but as I said she is a teen and doesn&#x27;t use it every day, probably more like once a day or every other day and when she forgets for several days, back is the eczema. If you are considering trying it, do.  I know it&#x27;s pricey but if you have serious problems with eczema and it does work for you it will be worth it as you must know like me anything that works is worth the money.  I am sure it won&#x27;t work for everyone but do try it if all else has failed.</li>
    <li> Ilove the wonderbar, best discovery ever.I recommend this to all of my family, which are using it as well. loves it</li>
