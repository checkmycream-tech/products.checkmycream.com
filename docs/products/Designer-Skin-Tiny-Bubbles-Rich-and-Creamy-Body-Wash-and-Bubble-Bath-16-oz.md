    <li> I had purchased this at my tanning salon on &amp;#34;Clearance&amp;#34; for $20. When I ran out, they no longer had it in stock, so I ordered it on Amazon for just about half the price. I love the way this smells, and it really does extend your tan.</li>
    <li> I really doubt that this will make your tan last longer, but it smells great and is very gentle. I like it a lot, but I&#x27;ll try something else next time.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Smells amazing like a piña colada, makes your skin super soft and moisturized, and keeps your tan glowing. If you tan, I highly recommend  this product. Even if you don&#x27;t it&#x27;s an amazing body wash. Wish it would lather a little bit more but otherwise 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t even expecting it for several days and was very pleasantly surprised when it arrived to quickly!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this! Definitely something I will continue to order!</li>
    <li> I love thia product it smells amazing.......  there is a very rich lather this is another amazing Designer skin product.</li>
    <li> love this stuff makes your skin feel so soft after the shower</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love love love love love love this body wash, the smell, feel, price, ect just wish it came in larger size :)</li>
    <li> This smells and feels nice. Even if I don&#x27;t tan one day I still shower with this tiny bubbles wash!</li>
    <li> Smells delightful and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome body wash. I used it for the first time last night and because of the other reviews I read, pumped about 6 pumps of product onto a bath pouf.  Waay too much product, in fact this body wash DOES lather up quite a bit. I&#x27;m thinking those that posted this doesn&#x27;t lather might have hard water and didnt realize that should have been factored in. Anyway this stuff is amazing and paired with the designer skin Angel lotion I feel like I didn&#x27;t wash off most of my tan today. It smells amazing too! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Smells great and lathers nice, but I don&#x27;t necessarily feel like this prolongs my tan. I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great smell, and keeps your skin glowing. I don&#x27;t feel like my color faded as fast once i started using this body wash. Plus designer skin is a great brand and they never disappoint me</li>
    <li> Who cares about a tan?  This stuff makes my skin feel soft and silky.</li>
    <li> This is a lightly lathering, clean-smelling body wash that leaves a delicate layer of silky moisture on your skin. I feel no tightness after showering, just fresh and clean. The only complaint I have is that it does not come in gallon jugs!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t bad, but not the smell I was looking for. Over priced. I&#x27;ll stick with the Hempz products from now on though.</li>
    <li> I love how this product smells. It leaves your skin so soft and moisturized. I highly recommend this. I will reorder this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet if this will help to extend my tan, but I do love the was it smells and feels and the fact that I can also use it as a bubble bath. I also really like the pump.</li>
    <li> OMG I WANT TO EAT IT :D HAHA WORKS SOO GOOD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEFINATLEY WHAT YOU NEED FOR A GREAT DEEP AND LONGER LASTING TAN</li>
    <li> I love this body wash! It smells so good and make my skin so soft ! This is my second bottle</li>
    <li> If you buy this from a tanning salon you will pay too much. It smells good in the bottle but the fragrance leaves in the shower. It does lather good but I don&#x27;t see a big difference from any other wash. I have no complaints about the amazon team. Very fast shipping and was just what I ordered. It&#x27;s the product that did not impress me.</li>
    <li> I love this product and just a little goes a long way. Helps me maintain my tan and softens my skin</li>
    <li> Loved the smell of this body wash.  It also does preserve your tan...the only thing is i wish it lathered more.  No big complaint!</li>
    <li> very very good!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff! Smells great, leaves my skin soft, and does help a little with keeping my very hard to achieve tan! Fast shipping and the product lasts longer than what I ever would have thought.</li>
    <li> One star tells it all.</li>
    <li> Love it and it smells like bubblegum</li>
    <li> Love the product! I love the way it smells and there is a ton in the bottle...however it doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this from the tanning salon I went to last year....but Amazon, of course, sells it cheaper so I got more.  I use it more for shaving my legs and it is excellent.  Smells like bubble come to me...yummy! :)</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great! I love it!It is so moisterizing too! It&#x27;s a little on the expensive side, but it is hard for me to find pineapple scents I love so I am glad I bought this product</li>
    <li> Disappointed  poorly packaged half was gone and the top of the bottle which is the pump part was broken.&lt;br /&gt;Going to buy this at the salon next time</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this body wash and it does seem to moisturize my skin better than what I had been using.</li>
    <li> a great body wash, just a little too fruity of a scent for me. I.prefer more of a sweet smell  This body wash is really fruity</li>
    <li> smells amazing and makes my skin so soft. i would recommend this to anyone who tans. i think its really helped my tan</li>
    <li> Really like Tiny Bubbles. Skin feels good.</li>
    <li> Has sodium lauryl sulfate which is a known drying agent. Wish I knew that before buying...</li>
    <li> Bought this from Sun Tan City (it was on sale for $14.99 only reason I bought there) anyhow, I just used it for the first time and my skin is so silky smooth it&#x27;s amazing. Scent is tropical and delicious, light lather(hence the tiny bubbles title) so I suspect that is one of its properties that will be tan preserving. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because I&#x27;ve only used it once... But I trust the product as it is a designer skin product. I would recommend this to any tanner, especially good for summer to keep moisturized and preserve your glow!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my tanning salon. it is AMAZING. The smell is wonderful and it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized. I definitely recommend this product. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Smells yummy (like pineapple) and was $15 cheaper than at the tanning salon. Seems to make my tan last longer.</li>
    <li> i def love this smell, its so sweet n juicy pineapple smell??&lt;br /&gt;but i am wondering that the exp date under the bottom?&lt;br /&gt;i dont understand.. it says 072013 then it means almost exp???&lt;br /&gt;is this authentic designer skin product right??????</li>
    <li> Not sure how well it helps extend my tan, but the lather is great, the smell is fruity and sweet, and it&#x27;s moisturizing. I will continue to purchase this!</li>
    <li> Tiny bubbles is good for shaving and body wash just not for bubble baths</li>
    <li> It smells great!  The price was so much better than any other carrier and it lasted forever!!! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> i bought this product at my awesome tanning salon it is an amazing product!its moist on the skin and thats a plus.i love designer skin and the tannman has the greatest prices!and the fastest shipping hands down.l0ve it!</li>
    <li> Cheap smelling and like herbal essences in a bottle</li>
    <li> I love the way this body wash smells. It doesn&#x27;t seem to strip my tan like other body washes. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh this is the most amazing thing ive ever purchased. Im super fair skinned and heavily tattooed, which are two no-no&#x27;s usually for indoor tanning. I shave my arms and legs to show off the tattoos so with that and indoor tanning my skins usually dry and keeping my tan is really hard. This stuff is amaaazzzinnnggg. Smells like pina colada, super rich lather and leaves your skin feeling awesome. Ill definately keep buying this, even if i stop tanning.</li>
    <li> To be honest, this does  nothing for your tan. It smells great and feels fantastic but as always I get out of the shower with my tan looking paler than it did before my shower, so my 3 stars is only because of scent and texture , product does not do what it says it will.</li>
    <li> Love it as a body wash.  Not so much as a bubble bath, i have to use alot of product to make bubbles.  Otherwise i wpuld have given 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This smells like a coconut &amp; pineapple drink. If you like that, you will like this. Its an awkward bottle to put in the shower though. It is a nice smell for a bubble bath too. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually extends your tan as a body wash, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt it.</li>
    <li> The package was busted!</li>
</ol>
