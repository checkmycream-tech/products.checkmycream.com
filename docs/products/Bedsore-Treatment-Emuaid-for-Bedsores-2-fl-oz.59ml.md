      <li>MY BED SORES HAVE GREATLY REDUCED IN SIZE AND SORENESS</li>
      <li>In the three weeks since, she has made an amazing turnaround!  </li>
      <li>all the pads meet together providing the most cushion yet still providing good cushion the the sides of the butt.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally,if your family member has bed sores on their feet too, then I found making a blanket trench is perfect to remedy this also.</li>

      <li>Note, I did not use exactly as emuaid directed, but I still got excellent results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, very important to know while using this boppy pillow is to elevate the thighs which are extended out off the boppy pillow.</li>
      <li>should.&lt;br /&gt;Oxygen, is a very important element in the healing process, please do not over look this.</li>
      <li>That is very important to ensure no infection starts.</li>
      <li>If you a immersing the wound with oxygen then you could use more gauze pads to cushion the patient when they are on the boppy pillow afterwards.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>You will see much better results</li>
      <li>You can also wash this pillow in the wash machine, but I would recommend keeping this pillow on the top part of your wash so it does not get cut up by the wash blades.</li>
      <li>I need more of a barrier cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll need to order more.</li>
      <li>So, once again be patient and most importantly persistent in the treatment!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is making my mums bedsore bum much better.  </li>
      <li>but we are glad we could keep it at bay.</li>
      <li>So, it goes to show you that most of the time when she is in bed we have her on the boppy pillow to enable the wound area to heal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you a immersing the wound with oxygen then you could use more gauze pads to cushion the patient when they are on the boppy pillow afterwards.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>So, once again be patient and most importantly persistent in the treatment!  </li>
      <li>I tried first to use good lotion like Lubriderm</li>
      <li>At a time like that you should be able to fairly easily tip the patient on their side to periodically use a blow drier.</li>
      <li>It is like a dream come true to use this!</li>
      <li>Do not expect this to be easy to heal your family&#x27;s wound.</li>
      <li>Works very quickly.</li>
      <li>Do not expect this to be easy to heal your family&#x27;s wound.</li>
      <li>Soak for about 15 minutes with hot water and salt using the wash rag, I always soak until the water becomes luke warm.</li>
      <li>She has been using it for just 3 days and there is a significant improvement.</li>
      <li>It will take time, and using the method I told with this wonderful healing cream I really believe it will work for you in most cases.&lt;br /&gt;Remember when taking off the medical paper tape use the hotwater and rub it on the tape so that the medical tape does not rip up the butt wound area in which it could turn into more bed sores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>I believe it is just sound logic to know that as long as aggravation persists on the wound area it will inhibit the person&#x27;s body from being able to heal the wound effectively.</li>
      <li>then I would highly recommend the synthetic sheep skin because of the added cushion for which the patient to lay on, and it is excellent protection from loose pee that may get through your pee pads protecting the patient.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s been several weeks now and still good results.  </li>
      <li>Do not expect a quick miracle, but there is hope with this cream.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, do not expect quick miracles, but one over time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, do not expect quick miracles, but one over time.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t really want I needed, but it works fine.  </li>
      <li>I would not normally recommend  using gauze pads without tape do to sliding off the wound area, but in this instance it is a good idea to promote the oxygen,&lt;br /&gt;Three or four good opportunities even a half hour apart from each other will be very effective.</li>

      <li>That way you protect the patient from laying on pee in a rare occasion.</li>
      <li>Worth every cent.</li>
      <li>That way you protect the patientfrom laying on pee in a rare occasion.</li>
      <li>I would use a nice real big quilt to elevate the thighs and knees sloped upward running away from the boppy pillow.</li>
      <li>IS WORTH THE MONEY.THANKS</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, I invite you to try the method I used if you believe it is worth a try to you.</li>
      <li>well worth</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, I invite you to try the method I used if you believe it is worth a try to you.</li>
      <li>right is that if you can easily place the urine pad underneath the patient&#x27;s discharge area, then that is one tell-tell sign that the patient&#x27;s wound area is near the epicenter of the boppy pillow adequately elevating the patient&#x27;s wound area.  </li>
      <li>Keep in mind you have to find the right balance of gauze pads to use.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind you have to find the right balance of gauze pads to use.</li>
      <li>Try to use water as hot as possible that the person is willing to stand.&lt;br /&gt;You can ring the soaking rag more in the beginning if too hot, then let more water stay soaked in the rag as you go on to ensure the soaking stays hot.</li>
      <li>I felt this product worked at its best when used after soaking a bed sore wound with two palm hand fulls of table salt and two handfuls of Epsom Salt in a approximate 1ft by 1ft square bucket of hot water.</li>
      <li>It is wonderful and cleared up a small bedsore that my mother had developed.</li>
      <li>That way you can easily have access to the patient&#x27;s wound sight to promote much oxygen to the wound coupled by keeping the patient more on their side as necessary.</li>
      <li>That way you can easily have access to the patient&#x27;s wound sight to promote much oxygen to the wound coupled by keeping the patient more on their side as necessary.</li>
      <li>Really Good product&lt;br /&gt;Based on previous reviews I bought this for my dad,  </li>
      <li>Also, frequent use of urine pads will keep the area dry.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, remember skin tears from taking off tape can easily turn into a bed sore too.</li>
      <li>Also, frequent use of urine pads will keep the area dry.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, remember skin tears from taking off tape can easily turn into a bed sore too.</li>
      <li>Now back on track to my regular original column: Another very good idea for convenience is to fold a urine pad inside out and stuff it under the patient&#x27;s discharge area rather than having to pull the pad up the patient&#x27;s legs which can be grueling having to do several times a day.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend all for healing and prevention if your loved one is not very mobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used approximately 3&#x27;&#x27; to 4&#x27;&#x27; of hot water with the salts.</li>
      <li>A regular old hair blow drier can effectively blow an immense amount of oxygen on the wound fast and effectively.</li>
      <li>This was our first experience with bed sores.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was all the Emuaid, but two days after the first time we used it the home health nurse was amazed at the improvement in her wounds.  </li>
      <li>My brother loved the air alternating pressure pump so much, he ordered one for himself because his job requires a lot of heavy lifting and he is always sore.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;In addition which is a huge plus, She sleeps very soundly and wakes up with no more aches and pains.  </li>
      <li>Keep in mind that you may have to use many towels to keep this wound area dry.</li>
      <li>Not sure how well it would do on more advanced sores</li>
      <li>the way, It is vitally important to keep as much pressure off the &amp;#34;pressure sore&amp;#34; or bed sore as possible.</li>
      <li>then you probably could imagine if you take advantage of blowing air on the wound to immerse it with oxygen, It will help promote skin growth much faster along with drying the wound out to take away the rawness.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My wife was having a real problem and this ointment came to the rescue to speed healing.  </li>
      <li>Does what it says very well.</li>
      <li>The cream and the air alternating pressure pump and roho seat cushion has really made a difference.</li>
      <li>I REALLY DIDNT SEE MUCH RESULTS ON MY 90YR.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Remember too, it is important to ensure that the family member is getting plenty enough protein whether from fish, eggs, yogurt, and etc.</li>
      <li>This device however was able to protect my grandmother completely along with using gauze pads, synthetic sheep skin pad, and of course cleaning and treating the patient slightly as necessary.</li>
      <li>IT WAS HEALED.THE CREAM DOES NOT HURT,IT COOLED THE AREA,STOPPED THE PAIN.I WOULD CLEAN IT DAILY AND PUT ON A LARGE NON STICK BAND-AID.I</li>
      <li>When we went in for the checkup I mentioned when I first reviewed, the doctor was very surprised at her progress.  </li>
      <li>This synthetic sheep skin really helps keep the patient dry and can easily be washed.</li>
      <li>This synthetic sheep skin really helps keep the patient dry and can easily be washed.</li>
      <li>It makes the wound area more terrible, and it takes a lot longer to heal.&lt;br /&gt;Lather with dial soap way better than you would even ever consider washing your own hands!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Fantastic product! We take care of our 93-year-old mother. She recently started with the symptoms of a bedsore and we ordered this product right away, after reading the reviews. It arrived in about two days. We applied and the bedsore was gone within three days!! It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I was happy that it only required a small dab at a time. Very pleased! Not sure how well it would do on more advanced sores but we are glad we could keep it at bay.</li>
    <li> Really Good product&lt;br /&gt;Based on previous reviews I bought this for my dad,  it works great. After 6 days  the results was healed.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help a bad sore at all and I had to go to the doctor.</li>
    <li> This was very expensive.... it did help but so does Aquafour at half the price</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST! MY MOM HAD A LARGE RAW BED OR PRESSURE SORE ON HER RIGHT HIP,IN 5 DAYS IT WAS HEALED.THE CREAM DOES NOT HURT,IT COOLED THE AREA,STOPPED THE PAIN.I WOULD CLEAN IT DAILY AND PUT ON A LARGE NON STICK BAND-AID.I WOULD PUT THE CREAM ON ANY RED SPOTS THAT I FOUND AND THEY WOULD BE GONE THE NEXT DAY.THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY.THANKS</li>
    <li> My mom has had 2 very painful bedsores for several weeks. Her doctor had no good ideas so I want to Amazon and found this product. It is exceptional. She has been using it for just 3 days and there is a significant improvement. This is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> She had bed sores all over her back and I bought this very expensive cream. The price is enough to change your mind but it really works if you clean the wounds and apply a thin layer maybe twice a day. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Works very quickly. Very happy with this product. Worth every cent.</li>
    <li> wonderful,works great, want more</li>
    <li> Emuaid works well on stages 1 and 2 of a pressure sore.  However, if someone&#x27;s pressure sore has advanced to stage 3, where the meat has actually been exposed, it is necessary to see a doctor for a prescription cream so that the pressure sore can heal properly and not advance to stage 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the pressure sore is just in the beginning stages, I would just buy Calmoseptine cream because it works well too and it is not as expensive.  It&#x27;s what a doctor instructed me to do.</li>
    <li> Yeah. Expensive, unproven, hyped, the kind of thing you buy when you don&#x27;t have the patience for a bedsore to heal naturally.&lt;br /&gt;Hasn&#x27;t really done anything I can see other than stink up the sheets.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I began using Vaseline and it shows to be having improvement over this very expensive cream. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I felt this product worked at its best when used after soaking a bed sore wound with two palm hand fulls of table salt and two handfuls of Epsom Salt in a approximate 1ft by 1ft square bucket of hot water. The bucket is bigger than the amount of hot water I used. I used approximately 3&#x27;&#x27; to 4&#x27;&#x27; of hot water with the salts. Try to use water as hot as possible that the person is willing to stand.&lt;br /&gt;You can ring the soaking rag more in the beginning if too hot, then let more water stay soaked in the rag as you go on to ensure the soaking stays hot. Soak for about 15 minutes with hot water and salt using the wash rag, I always soak until the water becomes luke warm. After soaking, lather will Dial antibacterial soap! That is very important to ensure no infection starts. There was an infection with my grandmother. It makes the wound area more terrible, and it takes a lot longer to heal.&lt;br /&gt;Lather with dial soap way better than you would even ever consider washing your own hands! Then, wash off the soap with the same bucket of salt water that you used and the same wash rag.&lt;br /&gt;What you want to do next is keep it sanitary by using a sterile pad. First use a sterile pad on the area to dry it above a towel. Keep in mind that you may have to use many towels to keep this wound area dry. Next, once the area is dry go ahead apply emuaid to wounded sore areas and bruised areas. Remember, you are in for a battle! This is not going to heal over night. Do not expect a quick miracle, but there is hope with this cream. This cream helped my grandmother heal up from a terrible bed sore/sores along with using all the methods I just explained I used.&lt;br /&gt;Remember this too, after applying the cream go ahead and apply two sterile gauze pads over the sore area as I did. Tape the pads on with medical paper tape.&lt;br /&gt;Then, use a &amp;#34;Boppy breast feeding pillow&amp;#34; that you can also find on amazon for sitting purposes. Ensure person is slid down just a little when using it. Also, very important to know while using this boppy pillow is to elevate the thighs which are extended out off the boppy pillow. Get the 100 % polyester. If you do not adequately elevate the patient&#x27;s thighs, then the person may very well slide down from the boppy pillow. What results from the slide down is that the butt wound area will touch the bed in which pressure will continue to inflict the wound area and the wound could get worse and obviously not heal. I would use a nice real big quilt to elevate the thighs and knees sloped upward running away from the boppy pillow. In doing this you can also build a foot trench to protect from bone spur bed sores in which you keep a pillow under the patient&#x27;s feet in parallel with the rest of the patient&#x27;s legs. Using a quilt or folded bed spread cover  or maybe one or two of each to elevate the thighs and legs will also ensure the patient is anchored on the boppy pillow correctly so that no slippage occurs and that the patients remains positioned in the middle void area concerning the tail bone area.&lt;br /&gt;***Recently added in: For laying purposes use the  Drive Medical Med Aire Alternating Pressure Pump and Pad System with Various Pump Options and Pad Styles, 78&amp;#34; x 34&amp;#34; as recommended by a fellow reviewer. This device is a life saver! It is like a dream come true to use this! It is especially for patients who do not have the option of sitting anymore. I highly recommend getting this device for having to lay the patient in bed.My grandmother got a lot weaker and could not even sit in a &amp;#34;boppy pillow&amp;#34; anymore. Even synthetic sheep skin pads on their own could not prevent terrible bruising and sores. This device however was able to protect my grandmother completely along with using gauze pads, synthetic sheep skin pad, and of course cleaning and treating the patient slightly as necessary. Keep the device on the soft setting, but not past this setting as the device will not function properly. Also, I would highly recommend folding this air pad mattress to double it up. I did this and it works perfect. I also keep a synthetic sheep skin pad on top of this as I lay my grandmother down. I use at least four gauze pads now and medical paper tape cleaning my grandmother once a day everyday on average. It is also a good idea to use gauze pads anywhere such as on the back of the patient coupled with a synthetic sheep skin when necessary to protect the patient. Finally, it is unnecessary to take patient off for cleaning purposes. Just half roll the patient each way to clean the mattress. For sliding purposes withe the air pad mattress just turn the device off and unplug the air tubes from the air pad and let some air drain out. I found that sliding the patient around is easier when the device is half full.&lt;br /&gt;*** Now back on track to my regular original column: Another very good idea for convenience is to fold a urine pad inside out and stuff it under the patient&#x27;s discharge area rather than having to pull the pad up the patient&#x27;s legs which can be grueling having to do several times a day. One rule of thumb to know if the patient is on the boppy pillow right is that if you can easily place the urine pad underneath the patient&#x27;s discharge area, then that is one tell-tell sign that the patient&#x27;s wound area is near the epicenter of the boppy pillow adequately elevating the patient&#x27;s wound area.  You can also wash this pillow in the wash machine, but I would recommend keeping this pillow on the top part of your wash so it does not get cut up by the wash blades. You may need to do slight sewing to patch the pillow every rarity if using in the wash because of the blades, but well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;By the way, It is vitally important to keep as much pressure off the &amp;#34;pressure sore&amp;#34; or bed sore as possible. So, if many out there who say this cream does not work, then likely this could be a major factor due to you are not alleviating the pressure off the wound area. I believe it is just sound logic to know that as long as aggravation persists on the wound area it will inhibit the person&#x27;s body from being able to heal the wound effectively. So, that is why it is so vitally important to keep the family member as much as possible on the boppy pillow when sitting or laying down. For example, my grandmother who is bed ridden at 87 years of age is on her boppy pillow approx. 7PM in the evening until 10:30AM. Then, we lay her down on her synthetic sheep skin  around 11:30AM or 12PM until about 5:30PM. So, it goes to show you that most of the time when she is in bed we have her on the boppy pillow to enable the wound area to heal.&lt;br /&gt;Remember too, it is important to ensure that the family member is getting plenty enough protein whether from fish, eggs, yogurt, and etc. It is vital to have the protein to ensure the body can have the ability to rebuild new skin tissue. If you do not keep the pressure off the area or give enough protein along with keeping the wound dry, soaked, soaped. creamed, patched, and providing oxygen at times, then you may be left scratching your head wondering why things aren&#x27;t working as they should.&lt;br /&gt;Oxygen, is a very important element in the healing process, please do not over look this. Take advantage of the times that you can promote a great amount of oxygen to the wound. A regular old hair blow drier can effectively blow an immense amount of oxygen on the wound fast and effectively. This will help promote skin growth coupled with the cream. For example when the patient is lying down. At a time like that you should be able to fairly easily tip the patient on their side to periodically use a blow drier. Set the blow drier at the cooll/High air setting. You will see much better results then you probably could imagine if you take advantage of blowing air on the wound to immerse it with oxygen, It will help promote skin growth much faster along with drying the wound out to take away the rawness.&lt;br /&gt;It is also good to keep the patient on alternating sides when they are lying down to take as much pressure off the direct wound area as possible. Just do not do it too extreme for too long. Sores could potentially develop even on the patient&#x27;s side hip area. At times a gradual slope is acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;Now, go ahead and patch the wound up with gauze pads for when the patient is on the boppy pillow. Though, when the patient is off of it that is when you should take advantage. When the patient is off the boppy pillow you could even just place the gauze pads underneath the patient without using tape. That way you can easily have access to the patient&#x27;s wound sight to promote much oxygen to the wound coupled by keeping the patient more on their side as necessary. I would not normally recommend  using gauze pads without tape do to sliding off the wound area, but in this instance it is a good idea to promote the oxygen,&lt;br /&gt;Three or four good opportunities even a half hour apart from each other will be very effective. Keep in mind you have to find the right balance of gauze pads to use. If you a immersing the wound with oxygen then you could use more gauze pads to cushion the patient when they are on the boppy pillow afterwards. Normally the more the pads you use will obviously smother the open wound from receiving oxygen hence the reason I am telling you to use a blow drier when you have the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;Also keep in mind that if you are laying a patient on air pressure mattress then it may take some time to learn to get the right combination of gauze pads to use which could be anywhere from two to five 4x4 gauze pads to have extra protection for the patient with cushion and to soak up loose pee. If the patient is on the air mattress then I would highly recommend the synthetic sheep skin because of the added cushion for which the patient to lay on, and it is excellent protection from loose pee that may get through your pee pads protecting the patient. That way you protect the patient from laying on pee in a rare occasion. This synthetic sheep skin really helps keep the patient dry and can easily be washed. I usually fold the gauze pads once each and make an X directly above the patient&#x27;s anal area that way in the worst area at the center of the X all the pads meet together providing the most cushion yet still providing good cushion the the sides of the butt.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally,if your family member has bed sores on their feet too, then I found making a blanket trench is perfect to remedy this also. Just keep the thighs, knees, and calf at one level with a quilt or thick blanket you fold under the person&#x27;s legs. Leave the last bit of the blanket unfolded compared to the rest that has propped up the thighs, knees, and calves. There should now be a little trench under the feet to allow room for a regularly fluffy pillow to be placed under the person&#x27;s feet to ensure the bed sore goes away and never comes back! I know this method works because my grandmother developed sores on her feet and this is what I did to remedy the problem. You could also just use a synthetic sheep skin pad for this too.&lt;br /&gt;Now, getting back on track to the regular buttocks bedsores; It is important to note that I soaked my grandmother, lathered her butt wound area with soap, and applied the emuaid cream two times a day once at about 10:30 AM and the other at 5:30 PM. Note, I did not use exactly as emuaid directed, but I still got excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;Again, do not expect quick miracles, but one over time. Doing this method my grandmother saw a complete healing of her wound after about 2 months. Other sores did develop around the original sore, which we also had to battle using this home remedy method I just explained. Do not expect this to be easy to heal your family&#x27;s wound. It will take time, and using the method I told with this wonderful healing cream I really believe it will work for you in most cases.&lt;br /&gt;Remember when taking off the medical paper tape use the hotwater and rub it on the tape so that the medical tape does not rip up the butt wound area in which it could turn into more bed sores.&lt;br /&gt;I felt there was no hope until I got this cream and used it along side the method which I stated. Remember to change the bandaging and use this method if you feel that this is the answer for you.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I want to say, always keep the wound area as completely dry as possible with urine pads of the like. Change them at least three times a day along side bed pans.&lt;br /&gt;I want to also mention that I have used DuoDerm patches before on my grandmother to help heal her bedsore at early stages; however, I want to warn you that I would certainly not use one of those Duoderm patches if the wound area is bruised, infected, or if there is any crust / skin scar tissue forming over the sore area. That is how my grandmother&#x27;s wound turned into a terrible nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;So, I invite you to try the method I used if you believe it is worth a try to you. Always remember that it is a battle and long drawn out war against these bedsores. Taking one half day off against these bedsores can mean giving back two weeks of ground that was hard earned with much effort to heal these things. So, once again be patient and most importantly persistent in the treatment!  All the best and I hope your family&#x27;s wounds are healed.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, if a wound area has been fully healed with new young skin that formed, then I would stop applying the cream to that area unless another open wound started. I want to state that I also continued to wash my grandmother&#x27;s old wound site once a day with dial soap  and kept three 4x4 inch gauze pads taped on her old wound area with medical tape to protect this area from redeveloping into a wound, I have to say that doing this along with elevating her thighs and legs above the edge of the boppy pillow has ensured a bed sore free butt. I used a little emuaid cream or neosporin as a quick touch up if necessary. Though,  now I haven&#x27;t really had any considerable problems at all since I elevated the thighs to keep the butt anchored. Just remember, from my knowledge bed sores come from pressure on the wound area. This often is initiated by a blood bruise as I call it in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sores also can come from pee making the skin soggy and more vulnerable to being ripped up by the pee and things rubbing against the wound area; dial soap will clean the pee and help keep the pee from infecting a possible bed sore with daily maintenance and guaze pads to keep the danger area more protected and to soak up any loose pee.. Also, frequent use of urine pads will keep the area dry.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, remember skin tears from taking off tape can easily turn into a bed sore too. It opens up the skin making the area vulnerable to turn into a sore quicker and also places the area at risk for an infection if the area is not washed enough with dial soap for example. Those skin tears can be dangerous so use hot water and even a soap rag and wring it over the tape you have used on the patient to then easily pull the tape off without ripping the patient&#x27;s skin into a &amp;#34;skin tear.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Another thing to consider buying would be synthetic sheep wool pads also sold here on amazon that I bought which help distribute the weight when the person is lying down, but I would not consider the sheep skin as a permanent fix to keep a person safe all day and night. For a permanent fix lying down use the For laying purpose use the  Drive Medical Med Aire Alternating Pressure Pump and Pad System with Various Pump Options and Pad Styles, 78&amp;#34; x 34&amp;#34; found on amazon as recommended by a fellow reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;One last note too, when you use the sterile gauze pads remember that sometimes it may be necessary to use two to air out the wound, but other times it makes more sense to use multiple gauze pads so that a bruise does not start and to ensure the area stays better protected.eep the patient on alternating sides when they are lying down to take as much pressure off the direct wound area as possible.

    <li> GOOD CREAM FOR BEDSORES.</li>
    <li> This ointment is miraculous for healing pressure related sores.  My wife was having a real problem and this ointment came to the rescue to speed healing.  This along with a Roho cushion is the answer to healing and preventing tissue breakdown.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my mother</li>
    <li> My 91yo mom broke her ankle and had to have screws and a plate installed.  After three weeks in a rehab, her ankle surgery sites, both heels, and the top of her foot had necrotic tissue due to the rehab bandaging it too tight.  The doctor said amputation would be the likely outcome.  The necrotic tissue was debrided and I brought her home, put her on a much better nutritional regimen (with AGPro and Super Collagen + as supplements) massaged her legs briefly twice per day to improve circulation, and applied emuaid to the wound sites when the home health nurse changed the bandages every other day.  (They cannot apply it unless it is in the doctor&#x27;s orders, but they let me do it.)  In the three weeks since, she has made an amazing turnaround!  We go back to the doc tomorrow, and I am confident amputation will no longer be on the table due to the granulation, epitheliazation, and continued lack of infection in the wounds.  Even the worst wound on top of her foot, where about 1 1/2&amp;#34; of tendon was exposed, is healing over!  I don&#x27;t know if it was all the Emuaid, but two days after the first time we used it the home health nurse was amazed at the improvement in her wounds.  I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It&#x27;s now a year later, and I wanted to add that my mother went on to recover completely from her wounds, and I think Emuaid made the difference.  When we went in for the checkup I mentioned when I first reviewed, the doctor was very surprised at her progress.  His words were &amp;#34;Your mom really surprised me&amp;#34; and he said as long as she kept making progress, we didn&#x27;t need to talk about amputation.  Thank you Emuaid.</li>
    <li> The sores are ongoing but the cream helped. I&#x27;ll need to order more.</li>
    <li> Works great for the skin</li>
    <li> Does what it says very well.</li>
    <li> I used this for my 85 year old mother.  I did not realize that she had a pressure sore until it was already very painful and actually an open sore in spots.  This was our first experience with bed sores.  I tried first to use good lotion like Lubriderm but it wasn&#x27;t working although faithfully applied.  Two or three weeks went by with no relief. Then I tried emuaid and what a difference!  Mom felt pain relief almost immediately.  I saw visible results in two days and the open sores had closed in four to five days.  It&#x27;s been several weeks now and still good results.  Redness is almost completely gone.  I apply now every day just as a preventative.  It is expensive, but worth every penny.  Now that I am on a maintenance regimen,  I use a thinner application each day for her</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!</li>
    <li> MY BED SORES HAVE GREATLY REDUCED IN SIZE AND SORENESS</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t really want I needed, but it works fine.  I need more of a barrier cream.</li>
    <li> For my father in law and his bottom sore due to prolonged sitting after a hip replacement and the stuff works as advertised.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My mom used it for about 2 weeks, healed her bedsore, good product!</li>
    <li> I have been applying this to my husbands reddened spine area that was just about ready to break down. The area is much lighter in color and no break down. I did also purchase the Duro- Med Foam Chair Pad which helped to relieve the pressure on his spine.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but felt I had to for this product.  It is wonderful and cleared up a small bedsore that my mother had developed.</li>
    <li> this product healed my pressure wound within 2 applications. It has improved my quality of life.</li>
    <li> This stuff is making my mums bedsore bum much better.  It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now and the redness is gone, still healing but this stuff is the bomb!  We used half of it and already ordered another jar.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2-15-15: In addition to the cream, I purchased an air alternating pressure pump.  [[ASIN:B002VWK1B8 Drive Medical Med Aire Alternating Pressure Pump and Pad System with Various Pump Options and Pad Styles, 78\\&quot; x 34\\&quot;]]&lt;br /&gt;For her recliner chair, I bought [[ASIN:B0002Q0660 Mosaic Roho Cushion 18 X 16]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sores kept coming back because she sits a lot and does not move much when she sleeps. The cream and the air alternating pressure pump and roho seat cushion has really made a difference. I highly recommend all for healing and prevention if your loved one is not very mobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition which is a huge plus, She sleeps very soundly and wakes up with no more aches and pains.  My brother loved the air alternating pressure pump so much, he ordered one for himself because his job requires a lot of heavy lifting and he is always sore.  This has helped his aches and pains as well.</li>
    <li> I REALLY DIDNT SEE MUCH RESULTS ON MY 90YR. OLD DAD. DONT KNOW IF THE PCA&#x27;S WASNT USING IT CORRECTLY BUT AS FOR MYSELF WHEN I USED IT ON HIM CONSISTATLY CORRECTLY SEEMED TO WORK. THATS WHY I GAVE IT A 4 STAR</li>
