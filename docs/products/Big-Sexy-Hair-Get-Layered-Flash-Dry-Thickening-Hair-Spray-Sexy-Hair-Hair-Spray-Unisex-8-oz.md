      <li>The spray is very very fine - which I like.  </li>
      <li>I still have it but use Sexy Hair&#x27;s &#x27;Spray n&#x27;  Play&#x27;</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Great, fast drying hair spray.</li>
      <li>great value fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I like that this spray dries so fast and has a really great hold.  </li>
      <li>If only the manufacturer could address this and find a fix, it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered more than once and will continue to order this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>Easy to pick out with tweezers for the most part, though.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Brushes out easily and holds well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great spray for short, fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have super fine hair and this product dries in a flash with out making my hair feel sticky.  </li>
      <li>and I can go all day without having to do a full restyle.  </li>
      <li>It holds, isn&#x27;t sticky and truly dries quickly</li>
      <li>I look for a decent hold without helmet head and an overwhelming scent.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipment!</li>
      <li>Great for layered hair...lift it up, give it a spritz and comb it down w/ your fingers.  </li>
      <li>Then the amazing thing is that I can get up the next day and touch up my hair</li>
      <li>but I finally know how to use this product effectively.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it is supposed to do - provide volume and a layered look to fine/limp hair.</li>
      <li>Also, I got this at a better price than from my local stores.</li>
      <li>I agree with the other reviews about it being a great product, but the nozzle definitely clogs a lot.</li>
      <li>I like in a VERY humid state</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Is a much softer hold than spray and play - which I like</li>
      <li>more due to the nozzle.</li>
      <li>I will stick with the other Sexy hair spray.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pain to unclog, but it&#x27;s worth the hassle since no other product works this well.</li>
      <li>I would rinse it with warm water to clear it, but then the water gets trapped in the lid.  </li>
      <li>This product is awesome - holds and controls frizz without being stiff or dull.  </li>
      <li>I have long fine straight hair, and every time I use this product, I get compliments that my hair looks like it has extra volume.</li>
      <li>I can even get another day out of my hair by either touching it up or doing a french twist which would usually be impossible with my super fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>I got a sample size of this and it amazed me so much I had to buy a larger size!!!!!</li>
      <li>even for my unruly, naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>A nice aerosol mist that holds, but not too firmly, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s so dry it could be used as a man&#x27;s hairspray.</li>
<li> I spray it on dry hair then scrunch it</li>
<li> I really like this hair spray, light enought that my hair doesn&#x27;t get weighted down but firm enough for bad weather ...</li>
<li> It helps to bring a young, edgy, look to a haircut.</li>
<li> so it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look wet like some hairsprays do.</li>
<li> really does thicken your hair----holds your style in place without that thick stiff cardboard look .</li>
<li> I&#x27;m extremely picky when it comes to hairsprays.</li>
<li> The down side - the nozzle gets clogged all the time.</li>
<li> Not sticky like your typical hairspray yet holds all day.  </li>
<li> Not The Spray for me, Heavy and gets sticky if yourscalp sweats.</li>
<li> Always have to have a few bottles of this in the house!</li>
<li> I have thick medium length curly layered hair.  </li>
<li> I have very thin hair</li>
<li> It does have a scent, but it isn&#x27;t bad and doesn&#x27;t linger around all day.</li>

    <li> I like that this spray dries so fast and has a really great hold.  I like the concept of the lid (it rotates open and shut over the sprayer versus a separate cap), however, it gets clogged somewhat often as a result.  I would rinse it with warm water to clear it, but then the water gets trapped in the lid.  Easy to pick out with tweezers for the most part, though.</li>

    <li> I LOVE, LOVE this product!!!  I have super fine hair and this product dries in a flash with out making my hair feel sticky.  It actually thickens my hair without making  my hair feel rough or sticky.  It is an amazing product.  Where has it been all my life??  I can style my hair and it holds beautifully without drooping even in the hot humid air of the south!

I can even get another day out of my hair by either touching it up or doing a french twist which would usually be impossible with my super fine straight hair. But this product makes it all possible.  If you have fine fly away hair, this is a must!</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and this gives a lot of volume.</li>
    <li> I had to play around a couple of times but I finally know how to use this product effectively. Love it</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is supposed to do - provide volume and a layered look to fine/limp hair. I have long fine straight hair, and every time I use this product, I get compliments that my hair looks like it has extra volume. The down side - the nozzle gets clogged all the time.

    <li> Would do business with this seller again. Very fast shipment! I really like this product. It is not sticky and holds your hair style well!</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray for my fine hair. It holds, isn&#x27;t sticky and truly dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look wet like some hairsprays do. However, the nozzle gets clogged all the time and nearly impossible to clear it out with the top on the spray. I still have it but use Sexy Hair&#x27;s &#x27;Spray n&#x27;  Play&#x27; more due to the nozzle. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the nozzle.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s so dry it could be used as a man&#x27;s hairspray. It helps to bring a young, edgy, look to a haircut.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair spray, light enought that my hair doesn&#x27;t get weighted down but firm enough for bad weather ... Also doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes  or coat my hair</li>
    <li> I only use this for &amp;#34;going out&amp;#34;.... but it definitely works to set a style and holds well all evening.... even for my unruly, naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job of thickening the hair .I have fine hair and it works great.I spray it on dry hair then scrunch it</li>
    <li> I have thick medium length curly layered hair.  This product is awesome - holds and controls frizz without being stiff or dull.  The spray is very very fine - which I like.  Is a much softer hold than spray and play - which I like but sometimes is too &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this.</li>
    <li> This spray is amazing-----it really does thicken your hair----holds your style in place without that thick stiff cardboard look . However, The nozzle tends to get hopelessly clogged and it takes some effort to fix this. If only the manufacturer could address this and find a fix, it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I got a sample size of this and it amazed me so much I had to buy a larger size!!!!! I love this stuff and it does make my hair look sexy!</li>
    <li> Great, fast drying hair spray.</li>
