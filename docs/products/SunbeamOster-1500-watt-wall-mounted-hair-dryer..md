      <li>Also, thanks to Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;it is the worlds best shopping source.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This unit is much larger than the compact types you see in hotels. It&#x27;s a top quality unit but you must have plenty of space and not troubled by the fact that its very ominous looking on your wall as opposed to the smaller models that are not an eye sore.</li>
    <li> it replaces  an older model we have had for years that finally died.  They are long lasting and very convenient being wall mounted. We have had one of these for  probably 15 yrs or more</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by the lack of heat generated by the drier. It takes longer to dry my hair even though it is short. It could also have a switch on the handle for turn it on.</li>
    <li> This was to be a replacement for a Sunbeam dryer we had in our home which is now working. Surprise!  We arenow  thinking of putting it in our vacation condo.  These dryers are absolutely excellent and we will buy another as a backup in case you all stop manufacturing them.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> we had a Sunbeam wall mounted hair dryer that lasted about 16 yr. hope this one is as good</li>
    <li> The dryer is identical to the one I had used for many years and really like it.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer.  Mount it on the wall in the bathroom and it works great!</li>
    <li> Sunbeam is not worth a s***.</li>
    <li> Have used this brand and similar style while vacationing at Ft. myers Beach for the last eight years and have finally got one for home. Easy to use and easy to maintain, I love it! This is one product that I will recomend to family and friends. Amazon.com always seem to have what ever I am searching to purchase.                                   Betty B.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer , have been using them for years.  Nice wall hung means out of the way not laying on the counter or having to unplug and put away each time it is used.  My last one lasted about 5 years.  Bought two more .</li>
    <li> Bought this because I loved the one in the motel room.  It seemed the same but there were only two speeds on this one, with no low setting. I would prefer high and low rather than medium and high. My medium long hair also gets caught in the vents. It would be nice if it had the ion feature on it as well as it can be harsh on your hair. Seller was fine.</li>
    <li> Heat settings only otherwise great. Shipping in time, cost is reasonable. We saw the dryer in a hotel and wanted one for home.</li>
    <li> My wife has been wanting one of these after our first Motel several years. Now we have one of the best hair dryers we have ever had works great arrived earlier than told.</li>
    <li> Had to replace our long used wall mount sunbeam hair dryer... and although this one isn;t exactly te same, it fits the space just fine and we are quite satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> THIS DRYER IS CONVENIENT AND OUT OF YOUR WAY IN THE BATHROOM....IT IS NOT AN EYESORE EITHER...IT LOOKS LIKE IT BELONGS IN THE BATHROOM...LIKE IT&#x27;S ALWAYS BEEN THERE....PERFECT GIFT!!!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to really use it yet but I already have one in my other bathroom and absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> good product, this the second one we have owned. Highly recommend this hair dryer, it is like the one&#x27;s used in hotels. The first we owned lasted 12 years of everyday use.</li>
    <li> A little larger than I thought it would be. Very easy to place on the wall. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This is a good addition to a bath room. Especially for short to medium length hair.Haven&#x27;t tried it on very long hair.Not too noisy, easy to handle. Plenty of drying power.E-Z mounting to wall.  Bargain at this price.</li>
    <li> I already have one just like it and decided to buy another one to have as a spare just in case.</li>
    <li> Not the first I purchased this product. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a quality dryer for a fair price</li>
    <li> These wall mounted hair dryers are a GREAT idea, however............. most of these don&#x27;t last very long with daily heavy use.  So long as these can be bought on the cheap and you can install yourself...it&#x27;s worth it.  Otherwise forget it  Buy more than one so when it craps out...you&#x27;ll have a spare.  Just my personal experince with these types/style of dryers</li>
    <li> We had the previous model for over 5 years.  Worked every day till the heating element broke.  So we had to replace it.  New unit is only improved.  Uses the previous mounting hardware on the wall.  We expect great things for this replacement.</li>
    <li> It was easy to mount and it works well. It needs a &amp;#34;cool only&amp;#34; setting to make it five stars</li>
    <li> Love this item.  Easy to install.  Very easy to use.  Its always handy and easy to get too. Heat and air is perfect as far I am concerned.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I noticed, while staying in hotels, that their blowdryers are much faster, cooler, and quieter than the types I have been using for years.  So, I wrote down the name of it and found it online.  I LOVE IT!!  It takes about half the time to dry my hair, and is much cooler, and slightly quieter.  I think it just blows a lot more air than my old model, which was a higher wattage.  The higher watts were probably because of the intense heat of the old one.  Anyway, my hair comes out looking better and holding the style better, too.  The only drawback is the wallmount.</li>
    <li> We had one previously that last for years!  Glad that we found the same to replace it.  Hope this lasts as long as the last one.  Works fgreat!</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  The cord doesn&#x27;t tangle, and when you&#x27;re done using it, it shuts off when you put it back in the cradle.  If I was going to change anything, I would have made it a smidge hotter, just because I use a metal brush to curl my bangs.  It works great, though, and is warm enough.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace one exactly like that I purchased about 7 years ago, which just died.  The dryer mounts easily to the wall, so it does not take up valuable counter or cabinet space.  It is well made and attractive, fits nicely in the hand, and is not overly noisy, like some dryers.  My only wish is that it had 3 speeds instead of 2.</li>
    <li> THE HAIR  DRYER WHICH I purchased from Amazon was just what I needed.  we were able to install it in the same place as the previous dryer ; both were from sunbeam or oster.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me a wall mounted hair dryer years ago when he worked at a hotel.  I do not ever want to go back to a regular blow dryer.  This one is even better than the last one I had as it does not get over heated when I am drying my hair.</li>
    <li> as noisy as other hair dryers.. wish it was quieter !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.  It installed well and is easy to use.  I knew when I bought it that it only had high heat and low heat settings, but I&#x27;ve been surprised by how much I&#x27;ve missed having a cool/air only option.  If they had a version with that feature, I would give it five stars.</li>
    <li> This is a good wall mount hairdryer, replacing an older Oster brand that finally expired after 12 years. It is a little bulkier than the other model and needs more wall space, but has a long enough cord to reach the outlet with no problem and a gray and white,modern clean look. I would have given it 5 stars, but the only feature missing is the lack of on/off switch on the unit itself, having the off/on switch on the wall mounting instead. I chose this unit because it has NO night light to shine into the bedroom and disturb sleep, like other wall mount dryers. Lots of phantom lights on every appliance these days, so this decided my choice. There is plenty of drying power and the handle is easy to grasp off the mount, also, the dryer is not too heavy to hold while drying my hair. The separate lint cover is a good feature, too. The coiled cord has not stretched out yet, so that is a plus. I installed it in about 15 minutes, the mount plate covered the holes from the older Oster unit.</li>
    <li> Received on time and in good order for my wife&#x27;s Birthday. Works good for the wife. I appreciated being able to add my left over gift card amount to the purchase and the free shipping !</li>
    <li> New in the package, just as ordered and expected.  The service was quick and the product was right.  It was easy to install in about 10 minutes and works great. This little gem really made my spouse happy and hey, it was a good day.</li>
    <li> Mounts easily to the wall or cabinet.  Keeps the bathroom clear and better organized.  I would recommend it.  Two more words.  OK, done.</li>
    <li> Had one before. Put this one in another bath. Would be better to ask me about the unit in 10 or 12 months. Just seems that some things this day and time aren&#x27;t as good as they were 20 yesrs ago.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Does what it is supposed to do and is compact and easy to use with good features too</li>
    <li> I loved this type of hair dryer after using one while on vacation.  I HAD to have one.  Easy to mount on the wall and powerful enough for my hair, I love it.  And you don&#x27;t have to wind the cord back up, then find a place to put it away.  I have a small bathroom and for me this was the perfect solution!!!</li>
    <li> Replaces my Oster. It works great.</li>
    <li> Completely functional&lt;br /&gt;Love it&lt;br /&gt;small criticism&lt;br /&gt;The plug-in cord should  be able to be shortened easily&lt;br /&gt;Maybe toggle bolts to mount it would be better</li>
    <li> Have had several before, wife like the convince of being hung on wall.  This is our third unit, wish it was more durable.</li>
    <li> I purchased one for each person of my family and my sister has four bathrooms in her house.  She was so impressed with it, she wanted to order three more, so I surprised her and got them for her.  They are the best on the market :-)  I would purchase again.  We did put one in our 5th wheel bathroom also.</li>
    <li> These are great.Our other got used so much , it finally quit. Reason 3 girls.enough said. so go buy one.</li>
    <li> I love it. I really do.  What more can I say? I mounted it on the wall and have used it since I got it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer.  I love having it on the wall.  It is like a luxury placed in a bathroom for your convenience.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Mount these in your bathrooms, frees up space, I love them Ithough it would feel like t&#x3D;you are in a hotel , instead they are cool one of them has a night light.</li>
    <li> This wall-mounted unit could be improved by having an on/off switch on handle. Also, the updated model(I have an older model also) sticks out much more from wall and a bit longer. The handle doesn&#x27;t give a solid lock-in click sound when placed in the cradle.It fell out a couple times so be sure you pound it in after use.The older models you had to squeeze the middle of the wall mount handset to release the lock. No more just pull it out to use..The power cord from cradle to handset isn&#x27;t tightly wound when not in use so it hangs on vanity top so to be safe I wrap it around the wall unit itself...</li>
    <li> Perfect size for home use!  We have one in our RV and bought one for our home. This is a Quality product!</li>
    <li> I love this.  Very quick and easy to mount on the wall.  Very convenient and no mess on the counter!  Always available when you want it.</li>
    <li> I came across this wall mounted dryer while staying at a Hampton Inn.  I thought it was a pretty nice looking unit and it felt solidly built so I ordered one.  Here are the Pros and Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Nice looking and solid built.  Dryer fits securely in the holder (this is a problem with a lot of wall mount dryers).  Quite running, long cord, good blower power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The mounting screws are crap (probably made in China)  Go buy some different ones.  The power cord is on the short side so decide were you are going to mount it before you buy.  You will need to be fairly close to an outlet and you will want to mount into a stud.  There is on cool (no heat) switch if that is something that you need.  In my opinion this seems more like 1000-1200 watt as it does not get as hot as my small hand held 1500 watt unit but it does well as far as drying my hair.</li>
    <li> I have owned an older version of this Sunbeam hair dryer that worked well for many years -- I&#x27;m thinking at least 10.  Unfortunately, this model was purchased just several months ago and already the \\&quot;On\\&quot; switch will not always catch.  I have to keep pushing it or the \\&quot;Off\\&quot; button to get it to work. Often I find, also, that the red \\&quot;Reset\\&quot; switch was triggered.  I haven&#x27;t yet contacted the company, but hope very much that they or Sunbeam will make a complimentary replacement.  If so, I will write a new review.  If not, never again will I buy a Sunbeam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New review:  The company from which I bought this hair dryer stands behind their product.  I have been sent a replacement as well as prepaid postage to return the original.  I am very pleased with this company&#x27;s customer service.  I do hope that this Sunbeam product is free from defects.  A wall-mounted hair dryer can certainly be convenient.</li>
    <li> Just like being in a hotel,  best method to keep the thing out of the way, and works well as a hair dryer</li>
    <li> Right after I first encountered one of these units over 15 years ago in a California motel, I have bought and installed them in all three of our bathrooms.  I have used competitive designs in other motels, but find that this one is still the best, and is reasonably durable.  Based on my experience, I would guess that a unit is good for about 3,000 uses, at a cost therefore of about 1 cent per use (not counting the cost of electricity).  In addition to high  and low fan settings, It also has two power (heat) settings; 1200 Watts and 1500 Watts; I prefer the higher one. The unit is shipped with the 1200 Watt setting.  In order to set it to 1500 Watts, you must pry off the air intake cover to get to the hidden switch.  You can also hide almost any length of excess power cord in the raceway on the back of the unit.  You may need to experiment some and use some sharp \\&quot;U-turns\\&quot; to get the length just right for your situation. You should also pry off the air intake cover and vacuum out the air intake grill at least once each month to maintain good air flow, and to avoid tripping the overheat thermal protector. I use the little lever on a fingernail clipper as a pry rod.  It fits just right into the pry notch. I too liked the smaller and utilitarian design of the older model, but understand that most buyers prefer the ergonomic look of the new unit.  When you stored the older unit into a mechanical clip, it gave you an audible click to let you know that it was firmly in; the newer model uses a magnetic mount. You don&#x27;t have to jam it in, but you do need to make sure the magnet has taken hold before you pull away your hand.</li>
    <li> The original sunbeam wall mounted hair dryer was much better.  It was smaller and easier to use.  This is ok since I can&#x27;t find the original</li>
    <li> I recommend this hair dryer because it works well and is easy to install in your bathroom.  The price is right too.</li>
    <li> My husband liked the convenience of these dryers in hotels. He liked that they were off the counter and tucked out of the way. This one arrived and worked perfectly. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday and works very well.  Would like to have shut off on the handle instead of just the wall mount, but otherwise excellent product.  Recommended to any one wanting wall mount unit.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t blow enough air, I need to buy a better one. Great size and I did not have to wait too long to get it.</li>
    <li> easy to mount and dries hair very efficiently without counter clutter.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 24 year old Sunbeam 1200 that finally died. Unpacked the new one and slid it onto the old mounting rack (same configuration as new one) and it was good to go! I expect this one to now outlast me!</li>
    <li> This is a newer model of the same product I have owned in the past. My purchase was made because of the quality of the older model. This model is about 25% larger than the previous model. If you are looking for sleek, this is not the model for you.  If you are looking for effectiveness and a product that is convenient than this is the model for you.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND IT  DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO.  I LIKE THIS HAIR DRYER BETTER THAN THE ONE THAT BROKE.</li>
    <li> I have used this hairdryer many times in many hotel and have always been pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable, looks sharp, and has different settings.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 1 for each bathroom in my new home - near the beach.  Family and friends will have the&lt;br /&gt;convenience of not having to travel with a hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Loved this hair dryer--did not make the bathroom hot.  Lasted 2 years, then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on and had to replace</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer. Has an option to switch dryer to 1200 Watts for economy. It&#x27;s easy to install; not too noisy; and dries quite well.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I use this Sunbeam hair dryer every time I stay at an Embassy Suites hotel.  They mount to the wall, so there&#x27;s always one available when needed and they stay out of the way.  The cord is coiled, which means no tangles but it&#x27;s long enough for my needs.  There&#x27;s a high and low setting but I always use high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only improvements I&#x27;d suggest are locating the on/off button on the hair dryer and not on the wall mount, and it would be nice if the hair dryer had a little more power.  I&#x27;d buy one of my own, if they could do that.  Otherwise, it does the job.</li>
    <li> I saw this in a hotel I was staying in and came home and ordered! Takes a mess off the counter and works like a pro. Turns my bathroom into that hotel feel every morning!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Sunbeam/Oster 1500 wall mounted hair dryer through Amazon, and am extremely happy with it. It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, and was very easy to install. I have two of them, one in each bathroom, and wouldn&#x27;t be without them. They are safe to use (GFCI built in), attractive, quiet, and they&#x27;re right where I want them, when I want them. My old dryer is now used only for thawing pipes and drying boots in the winter time!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this hair dryer.  He doesn&#x27;t have to coil it up and put it away like a regular blow dryer.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a big large.  But hey, he&#x27;s happy and it&#x27;s in his bathroom, so I&#x27;m fine with it!</li>
    <li> I have seen this product in major hotels while vacationing and visiting with family out of state. I really liked the way this product preformed. I decided to see if I could purchase it for my own personal use at home through the internet. And to my amazement I found it on Amazon! I was so  surprised and Very HAPPY to get it in the mail and so quickly! I would not trade it for anything. I would recommend this hair dryer to anyone looking for new one. It&#x27;s lightweight and powerful. I use it everyday. It seems to gets the job done quicker than my other heavier hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Great Item for a great price</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ve seen them in hotels for years and you wish you had one at home.  Now I do!!</li>
    <li> Excellent with TWO exceptions: 1) Does not have a medium setting like the one this unit replaces.  2) Does not have a screw mounting hole in hairdryer cavity to secure unit to wall</li>
    <li> I have always loved using these in hotel rooms so after a recent holiday I thought I should see about getting one at home. I Love it! No rummaging around in a drawer, tangled cords, etc. Very convenient and looks great on the wall</li>
    <li> This dryer is powerful enough it just produces luke warm air.  It was very convenient to install as clippped right on to the existing sunbeam plate bracket.</li>
    <li> i have owned a few of these before, same style and model. they are very dependable. i love having them mounted on the wall in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hairdryer back in 2000 and had used them since. After a few years&#x27; use I noticed the plastic part got a small hole burnt. I found a way to still use it by letting it sit until it cooled down before placing it back into the mounting fixture. So based on the durability of the product I bought this model again expecting Bunbeam to have improved in the design about the heat discipation. My previous 3 dryer are still working but I changed them all anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with the new design - it becomes more stylish and after drying my hair when I hold the blow hole by hand it&#x27;s just mildly warm - not hot at all. It is not a very quiet hairdryer but I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. I expect to last 20 years.</li>
    <li> I love this in my kids bathroom because its something they actually put up! It&#x27;s working great! Our last one only lasted about a year, so hopefully this one will last longer</li>
    <li> Bought one of these about six years ago and loved it but it finally died and I never thought I&#x27;d find another and just for kicks put in the name on Amazon and WOW there it was..........so I bought a new one...love it, wife uses it more than I do as my hair is only about one inch long.  It is great, got real good service out of the last one, got my moneys worth so I bought another.  Good product, good service, fair price, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to install and works perfect. Big time saver.We had one in our RV and Liked it so much we bought one for the house.</li>
    <li> Had it about a month and love it.  Better than the earlier models I&#x27;ve had in some ways.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Light weight, easy to handle,good power and settings!</li>
    <li> Very nice sleek design.</li>
    <li> We use this multiple times a day and it is very convenient having it on the wall. Liked the idea after seeing it in hotel rooms.</li>
    <li> No problem with order or installation since it is a replacement for a dryer we used for a number of years.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have Oster wall mounted hairdryers in my home and y RV, as well.  This new one is even more powerful than the others, so I love it!</li>
    <li> This little dryer fits the bill perfectly.  It is one great addition to our bath room.  Don,t know why we didn&#x27;t get one sooner</li>
    <li> Well actually my wife loves it.  I don&#x27;t have enough hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer. It is the second I&#x27;ve put in our home. This one has just the right power and heat!!</li>
    <li> Replacing an old one. Works well just not quite as lightweight or as hot as my old one. Would recommend, though.</li>
    <li> Ordered this item, forgot to check up the delivery status, before i realised it was delivered ,&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the delivery, very happy with the product&lt;br /&gt;100% satisfied</li>
    <li> shipped quickly and is exactly as expected.  We had seen this in hotels and my wife wanted one.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the blow dryer. It installed very easy, and works great. What is to say it is a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> My old wall mount oster finally died after 10 years of use. Before guests used it they would see it&#x27;s small size and get disappointed that they didn&#x27;t bring their own, but I never heard complaints AFTER they used it. I love this thing! It does the job well and it&#x27;s never forgotten on the counter due to the wall mount design. I wouldn&#x27;t own anything else...</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of these for both of my houses.  I use it in our own bathroom and all guest bathrooms.  It is very convenient.  The quality of Oster is also top notch.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is one of the best I have bought in a long time.  I had it installed in my bathroom in the fall. It has served me well.  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Compact, easily mounted on bathroom wall and power settings appropriate for home use. Working fine thus far. Would recommend. Priced correctly.</li>
    <li> This was my second one to own. It lasted for years. I hope this one will be the same. I recommend this hair dryer. Thanks Amazon. 😀</li>
    <li> This thing works like a top. it&#x27;s handy and the mount keeps it up out of the way. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> working well, adequate heat. Very convenient to use having it mounted on the wall. comfortable to hold. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is really simple to hang, works well, and keeps the countertops clutter-free. We have been so happy with it, we&#x27;ve purchased the Sunbeam one each time... years in-between - it lasts well.</li>
    <li> This is the second Sunbeam/Oster &amp;#34;wall&amp;#34; mount hair dryer we have had over&lt;br /&gt;perhaps the past twenty years, and we have never been more satisfied.  It&lt;br /&gt;looks good on our bathroom wall, and it is not intrusive in any way.  It is also&lt;br /&gt;quiet and easy to keep clean.  I recommend it highly.  Also, thanks to Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;it is the worlds best shopping source.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of the Sunbeam/Oster wall mounted hair dryer.  After years of enjoying the wall mount in hotels, I decided to buy one for my bathroom at home.  Best thing I could have done.  When my first one gave out...had to have another.  Plus:  Convenient, easy to use, out of the way of other things, and clean.  Minus:  Lower wattage means slower drying.  Would not like it for long, thick hair.  Cord could stand to be longer to stetch just a bit further.  Really like this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this Sunbeam hair dryer to replace one I have had for years.  Apparently some corners have been cut in&lt;br /&gt;the quality of the parts.  The fan blades came apart and were forced into the electric heating elements and caused&lt;br /&gt;quite a bit of noise.  Not a good thing while one is standing in the bathroom trying to dry one&#x27;s hair and holding&lt;br /&gt;it six inches from your head.  Purchased through Amazon from Goodman&#x27;s Sales, LLC.</li>
    <li> Works well....just the ticket!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works well and was easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;It was a little larger than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This works just great by hanging it on the wall it is always ready for use but up out of the way</li>
    <li> Great product. This hairdryer is the best. Enough wattage and lightweight. Wall mount easy to install and saves counter space.</li>
    <li> The red carton photo is correct.  The unboxed hair dryer is a misrepresentation.  The boxed dryer is considerably bigger and bulkier than the older model shown here.  When I asked to return it, the seller said I would have to pay shipping both ways ($25), making returning this $30 product absurd.</li>
    <li> so far so good.  My husband ordered it, but we both use it.  Have had a similar  one before and used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping this one last as long.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is a replacement for the one we&#x27;ve been using for almost 12 years.. We finally wore it out. We love the new one. It&#x27;s more stylish and still does the job! It&#x27;s so handy to have it on the wall instead of on the vanity top!</li>
    <li> We have bought a number of these in the last few years and can&#x27;t understand why any other model would be wanted.  We have one in each bathroom, total of 5 units, and they last a very long time with no trouble.  Got here just in time for the guest bathroom and our house-guests loved it too.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised/ Not the most powerful, but works well</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to get one for myself.Very nice and professional looking.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Always liked these off the counter dryers in hotel rooms.</li>
    <li> I got tired of taking the dryer out of the cabinet and putting it back and the kids &amp;#34;stealing&amp;#34; mine and not putting it back.  Problems solved!  It&#x27;s attached to the wall :-)  I only wished it was  a little stronger/hotter.</li>
    <li> my mother in law loves this thing.,,,,personally it doesnt work on my thick extremely curly hair. but if you habe straight or short hair, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I love this purchase. I bought 3 of these, Two for Master bedroom as it has a larger dressing area and each sink now has a Dryer mounted near it. One for the guest bath. Mounts easy, and doesn&#x27;t wobble. Not exactly flush with the wall due to the mounting plate but, that is not an issue at all for me. Dryers work better than the big bulky one I had before that was laying on the counter and constantly falling off onto the ground. Simply hanging it back up turns the dryer off. FANTASTIC.</li>
