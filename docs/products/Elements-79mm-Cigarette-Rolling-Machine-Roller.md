      <li>perfect roller for perfect price .</li>
      <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>awesome roller for begginers</li>
      <li>BUT it still rolls great, just from time to time it snags and the paper wont roll streight.</li>
      <li>looks very nice and its probably going to smoke well.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend he loved it.</li>
      <li>As for the product I would have to say its a good roller.</li>
      <li>instructions, fair price.</li>
      <li>Good sturdy roller -</li>
      <li>Good roller, a bit longer then the papers,</li>
      <li>good product .</li>
      <li>When I rolled the first joint, it came out perfect.</li>
      <li>The Element roller rolled with ease and the joint came out looking nice and</li>
      <li>This one is the best of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth action.</li>
      <li>very cheap but for the price i would recommend it to any smoker</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no lifetime piece but its not bad or cheaply made its a great bang for your buck.</li>
      <li>Also you have make sure that the elements logo is at the top of the rolling apparatus when your done rolling it or</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Will buy another when when this one stops working :)</li>
      <li>got this item fast and in great packaging and wrapping, great pricing that beats any real smoke shop or gas station price.</li>
      <li>and it worked perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>I use it almost everyday, it fits all of my rolling papers, and rolls a perfect joint every time!</li>
      <li>I had to work it for a while before it rotated a full circle.</li>
      <li>I love my new Elements Roller.</li>
      <li>Ultimately it rolls nice J&#x27;s but the belt is sensitive and you may want to find one that is more manageable in that department.</li>
      <li>This rolling machine is worth the price.</li>
      <li>It was just right.</li>
      <li>else the flower will pop right out and all over your lap, desk, or the floor.</li>
      <li>So I guess read the directions first! ;)Also I almost lost more flower when the belt suddenly jumped out of the pin sockets because I put too much pressure on it.</li>
      <li>first thing to wear</li>
      <li>this item is exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>This roller works awesome, the only thing I can complain about is that if you don&#x27;t put enough \\&quot;rolling material\\&quot; in the roller, the paper won&#x27;t roll and it will just come back through.</li>
      <li>I had a king size Job roller break on me yesterday and it was my first roller.</li>
      <li>im sure this will last much longer.</li>
      <li>However, be careful they are very easy to lose...</li>
      <li>The shipping was pretty fast.</li>
      <li>well circulated, ready to smoke.</li>
      <li>Slightly larger size @ 79mm, works, better for medical rolls.&lt;br /&gt;Extra roller belt included, also works,</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Needs to say &amp;#34;this item does not fit with most of the elent&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I had to wrap the rollers with several layers of scotch tape to get nice tight cigarettes out of it.</li>
      <li>I had trouble with rolling my J&#x27;s too tight with the Job king size roller, although it was more secure.</li>
      <li>The rolling belt is very sensitive and the rolling pins pop out of their sockets when you go to roll up.</li>
      <li>The thing I like about the Elements rolling machines is that they come with a spare vinyl roller hammock which makes it last much longer!</li>
      <li>the sleeves last longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried, and it comes with an extra sleeve, which is a really nice feature.</li>
      <li>i have had no issues with the product thus far.</li>
      <li>First off, be careful when you roll your joint.</li>
      <li>overall, this product is worth the money spent.</li>
      <li>So in short, its just kind of poorly built.</li>

    <li> this item is exactly as advertised. works well. i have had no issues with the product thus far. overall, this product is worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> Good roller, a bit longer then the papers, but since I use it to roll Mugwort cigs it allows for end tucking. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend he loved it. shipping was kinda slow but It is durable, bigger, and had 2 sleeves. were happy!</li>
    <li> Very poor description when ordering.  All the papers&lt;br /&gt;I can find or buy do not fit this item...  who ever sold this item&lt;br /&gt;Needs to say &amp;#34;this item does not fit with most of the elent&lt;br /&gt; Papers.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Slightly larger size @ 79mm, works, better for medical rolls.&lt;br /&gt;Extra roller belt included, also works, first thing to wear out.&lt;br /&gt;Good instructions, fair price.</li>
    <li> I use it almost everyday, it fits all of my rolling papers, and rolls a perfect joint every time! Definitely recommend this to any smokers looking for a roller, the price is killer.</li>
    <li> My roller arrived broken BUT it still rolls great, just from time to time it snags and the paper wont roll streight. Will buy another when when this one stops working :)</li>
    <li> awesome roller for begginers</li>
    <li> This was my fist ever joint roller and it worked perfectly fine. However, be careful they are very easy to lose...</li>
    <li> This product comes with an extra rolling leatherish part but idk how i wpuld put it on other than that its of quality and is durable.my zig zag one is un threading after 6 months im sure this will last much longer.</li>
    <li> The thing I like about the Elements rolling machines is that they come with a spare vinyl roller hammock which makes it last much longer!</li>
    <li> Elements 79mm Cigarette Rolling Machine, Roller  --  I&#x27;ve recently bought several different brands.  This one is the best of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth action.</li>
    <li> I ordered this rolling machine and got it 3 days later. The shipping was pretty fast. As for the product I would have to say its a good roller. When I rolled the first joint, it came out perfect. It wasn&#x27;t a skinny joint nor a fat joint. It was just right. This rolling machine is worth the price. It works well. I love it. I rolled the joint in less than a minute.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a roller expert by any means. I had a king size Job roller break on me yesterday and it was my first roller. I picked one of these up at a piece of mind store for about $5. First off, be careful when you roll your joint. The rolling belt is very sensitive and the rolling pins pop out of their sockets when you go to roll up. Also you have make sure that the elements logo is at the top of the rolling apparatus when your done rolling it or else the flower will pop right out and all over your lap, desk, or the floor. So in short, its just kind of poorly built. I will say however that the joint I rolled with it looks very nice and its probably going to smoke well. I had trouble with rolling my J&#x27;s too tight with the Job king size roller, although it was more secure. One complaint that I had with my Job roller was that it stuck when I put the paper into it. I had to work it for a while before it rotated a full circle. The Element roller rolled with ease and the joint came out looking nice and well circulated, ready to smoke. So I guess I would say order one of these if you like, but be careful with the loose rolling pins, I lost about .3 gram of flower when the belt flipped up on me because the Element logo wasn&#x27;t in the start position. So I guess read the directions first! ;)Also I almost lost more flower when the belt suddenly jumped out of the pin sockets because I put too much pressure on it. Ultimately it rolls nice J&#x27;s but the belt is sensitive and you may want to find one that is more manageable in that department. I&#x27;m looking into picking up a RAW king size roller myself.</li>
    <li> Good sturdy roller - the sleeves last longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried, and it comes with an extra sleeve, which is a really nice feature. However, I had to wrap the rollers with several layers of scotch tape to get nice tight cigarettes out of it.</li>
    <li> Product broke within 1 day of using it..... very cheap but for the price i would recommend it to any smoker</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no lifetime piece but its not bad or cheaply made its a great bang for your buck. Not to short yet not to long like the 110mm.</li>
    <li> I love my new Elements Roller. I always try to buy Elements rollers because I put a lot of miles on them. They seem to last well and they come with an extra sleeve.</li>
    <li> This roller works awesome, the only thing I can complain about is that if you don&#x27;t put enough \\&quot;rolling material\\&quot; in the roller, the paper won&#x27;t roll and it will just come back through.</li>
    <li> Wobbly,  stretched roller.</li>
    <li> got this item fast and in great packaging and wrapping, great pricing that beats any real smoke shop or gas station price.</li>
