<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price. You save nearly ten bucks by getting the 4 pack verse going to a store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; facial washes and they have too much fragrance added to them.  They can&#x27;t be very pure or good for your face.  This stuff has no fragrance and cleans very well.</li>
    <li> A good cleanser - always</li>
    <li> will give your skin a deep scrub, leaves skin feeling tight</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I found this bulk on amazon. It saved me a few dollars.</li>
    <li> There us absolutely nothing I trust more than this for a thorough, yet gentle cleansing...It gives and awesome feel..you actually feel so clean!</li>
    <li> I have used this since I was a teenager, and while I have tried many expensive face washes over the years, this is still my fail safe. In my experience, nothing leaves your face feeling more clean. My oldest child is now a teenager, and I buy it in bulk for us to share. One word of advice, though, do not get this in your eyes! It burns like mad...</li>
    <li> I am so damn aggravated that this item is now seemingly only limited to fragrance free (which its not) cuz it smells like fish oil - I miss the old formula which is in bars only - of which I personally hate bar soap - soap is so intimate and personal and needs to be enjoyable wether organic or synthetic - why on earth an iconic brand diverts from its flagship formula is beyond me - Comet did this also by putting bleach in all its products and not offering the original formula anymore - I say its insanity</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this and it was the second time I ordered it.  I also use it for shaving sometimes and that works out well too.  It seems cleaner than soap and less drying.  Smells fine, and the smell does not linger after being washed off. Pump is convenient too.  Online price is right too.  Takes months to use up.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, cleans but doesn&#x27;t overdry your face.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy 2-packs from Costco when they carried this item.  Costco stopped selling it and I was pretty bummed.&lt;br /&gt;I tried other facial cleansers, but they just don&#x27;t compare (especially Cetaphil, which I hate because it doesn&#x27;t really foam up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now willing to pony up the extra scheckels to buy this product because it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> It cleans my face better then a cream or other cleansing liquid. Have used it for many years. Have tried other products like this at times just to see the difference. I always come right back. Takes off waterproof products better than any other brand or type of product to take off waterproof makeup, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the description said in perfect order</li>
    <li> This is perfect for people with sensitive skin</li>
    <li> My understanding is that Neutrogena has discontinued this product.  I use it every morning and night and it works great.  They have new more expensive stuff that I find does not work as well.  This purchase was fragrance free, although I prefer the fragrance.  I would get it while you can</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena products for many years.  The product is great.  I used to get the same product from Costco.  However, Costco no longer carries this.  This is first time I bought it from online.  When I opened the box, I noticed the buffering bag doesn&#x27;t seem to be fully around the product and the package is squeezed.  I opened the box and saw One of the bottle broken.  I poured it to old bottle since returning would give me more hassle.  Hopefully seller can see my message and pay more attention in the future for other customers.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face soap, and this is a great deal. Fragrance free and easy to pump. So much cheaper than the drug store!</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and this is the only facial soap I use.  It is gentle enough for sensitive skin, but strong enough to take off most makeup so that I do not have to use oily makeup removers.  I have been using this product for many years.  It can range in price from $8 - $10 in stores, but you can get it for about $5 a bottle if you purchase a 4 pack on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My fiance has very super sensitive skin and will break out in rashes and/or eczema with most products. Some products claim to be fragrance free but include natural fragrances. Some of those can be overwhelming for sensitive skin. After many different products, this is the ONLY one that works for her skin. Your results may differ, but it worked for her and when she looks good, she feels good and when she feels good life is just a little bit brighter and easier:-)</li>
    <li> I have ordered this many times which should be should be self explanatory.  It is an item that I use regularly and ordering it through Amazon make the necessity of finding it elsewhere unnecessary.</li>
    <li> i was introduced to this product about 12-15 years ago. can&#x27;t imagine a clean, oil free/acne free face without it. the only time this product doesn&#x27;t work by itself is when the mother-in-law causes the stress based acne flare ups. enough about the wench, this is a great product that has kept my face free of acne for over a decade.  too bad it&#x27;s not available through most supermarkets/pharmacy chains anymore.  btw - guys, don&#x27;t be fooled by the neutrogena equivalents for guys - they use half the salicylic acid in the \\&quot;mens\\&quot; stuff as they do the \\&quot;womens\\&quot; stuff.  man up and buy the girlie goods - they finally have the equivalent to that deodorant for facial cleanser -&gt; strong enough for a man but made for a woman. &#x27;nuff said.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for many years.  It is effective and easy to use.  Much neater than using bar soap/</li>
    <li> I have normal skin (not oily or overly dry). My skin tends to change a little bit depending on weather, and I LOVE this cleanser. Since receiving it, I&#x27;ve used it morning and night nd everyone keeps telling me how radiant my skin is looking. I finally feel like having a bit of a skin care regimen is manageable. Great Product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years! I have acne-prone, sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers but I always go back to this. It cleans your skin completely--which WILL leave it dry. That is not a good thing, so be sure to use with a moisturizer after (which you should do anyway if you have skin like mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is mild but not exactly good. It doesn&#x27;t bother me as I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, and you won&#x27;t smell it after rinsing. I tried the fragrant version but hated it, didn&#x27;t like the smell. Without fragrance you can at least ignore the scent while you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t need a pack of 4 at once since 1 bottle will last me like a year... But at least I won&#x27;t have to buy any for a loooong time. Pro tip: use half a pump, not a full pump, unless you have a grotesquely huge head... That&#x27;s plenty to wash your face with.</li>
    <li> We use this for hand soap.  It cleans well without drying out the skin.  A bit harsh for my face, but I&#x27;m sensitive.  We go through a lot, and it&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena since 1986.</li>
    <li> i use it, i don&#x27;t know if it works, no allergic reaction so thats good, face feels not dry but tighter like its gotten rid of age lol but its good</li>
    <li> I used this product for years found it the best to keep from getting facial pimples and it is gentle to my skin.</li>
    <li> Good product. Been using for many years. Love that I can buy in bulk on AmaZon. Giving to my kids now.</li>
    <li> Same classic formula.  A little bit of heaven in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is the product I been used for more than 10 years I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap around and it came in a 4 pack. I could not be happier. I love the way it keeps your skin clear and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 15+ years and it&#x27;s great.  I feel like my face is nice and clean after using it.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
    <li> great price for this  product, have a hard time finding it in stores and this is a better deal! Wow</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  It&#x27;s great stuff...shipped well...good price...Will order again...Makes my face feel clean without drying it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love how my face feels after using it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy ordering from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Arrived on time~</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find Neutrogena&#x27;s scented liquid version anymore. But I still like the gentle cleaning power of this soap above all others.</li>
    <li> I have always used Neutrogena without a problem and it has always left my face smooth and makeup/dirt free. I also like Neutrogena since they have an option of fragrance, or fragrance free. I always go for the fragrance free formula since I have allergies. One drop of this will remove all makeup and dirt, and it suds&#x27; up VERY well. These bottles last a very long time, and I will never use anything else. I would recommend Neutrogena to everyone since it works so well, removes all dirt and oils without over-dying the skin. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is very good product. it works like the other Neutrogena product like the grapefruit one. But it leaves a dry feeling once it is removed. Also it is FRAGRANCE FREE. Like no smell at all. it smells like dry clay. But if smell doesn&#x27;t bother you then it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and now it appears it may be off the market. Hope it isn&#x27;t so, but I ordered 12 bottles just in case.</li>
    <li> I like the products with pretty bottle, and i never try this cleanser before, but it has a special smells.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and I really like how it made my face look and feel. It is nice to be using the product again and no that I am getting the same results. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is that it&#x27;s more drying than the liquid soaps I used to use.  Although I have tested allergic to fragrance, my hands were actually a little itchy after using this soap--which they had not been with my old Aloe Vera soap.  I guess that&#x27;s the price one has to pay for fragrance-free.  Problem easily solved with a little fragrance-free hand cream.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have used this consistently for several  years. A very pure product. This is a very good product.</li>
    <li> This was the best online value I&#x27;ve gotten on this product, as there are 4 bottles instead of 3 in this pack. Take note, some of the other offerings are only 3 bottles. Thanks so much!!!</li>
    <li> Lightning fast shipment A+++++++++++++</li>
    <li> The gold standard of face washes. The 4 pack is a good price vs getting it from the store.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser mainly for the fact that its unscented and my skin is very sensitive to scents. And it came with a lot more than I expected!!! I seriously bought this product over a year ago and I have only gone through 3 bottles, but theres still one more! Going to buy more soon for sure. :)</li>
    <li> We buy this pack monthly!!!  Good price for quantity</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, but this cleanser has always cleaned my face well and even wash off any makeup I have on. I don&#x27;t even need makeup remover with this facial wash! I love that it is fragrance free as many products with fragrance have chemicals that irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years. Removes make up, dirt and oil. I love it. Use it every morning and every night</li>
    <li> Always good to be able to buy something we love in bulk at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Purchasing the 4 pack here saves you $13 compared to local store. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years, no scent, no oils, just clean.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena fragrance free liquid facial cleansing formula works great for cleaning our faces even though my hubby &amp; and I have completely different skin types.  His is oily and mine is dry but it does wonders for both!!!!  ; )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Neutrogena product for years and home I never have to change.  It does a great job cleaning my sensitive skin.  When I&#x27;ve tried other facial cleansing products I always experience a bad reaction.</li>
    <li> I appreciate the price on this item... to get 4 for that price is really nice... I use this product daily for years</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I have used this off and on over the years and stopped on occasion to try other products. I got hooked on Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub but then I discovered it had additives that were not so healthy, unlike this product which is pretty much safe from most undesirable chemicals which must be avoided in this household where strong allergies exist that react violently to some of the ingredients they put in cleansers and creams, such as soaps, shampoos, conditioners, facial creams, etc. This one is probably the safest of all as the ingredients listed here are not on any of the lists of ingredients to avoid. Highly recommended as a safe, healthy and effective facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is the most gentle cleanser I have found.  I tend to have dry skin and this completely eliminated winter itches.</li>
    <li> I have used this same face wash since I started a skin care routine in my pre-teen years. 2 decades later, it&#x27;s still the product I use daily on my face. I just recently started buying these bottles in bulk on Amazon due to the GREAT price! It&#x27;s much less expensive than Target, Walmart, or our local grocer, HEB. Both Neutrogena&#x27;s product and Amazon&#x27;s price cannot be beat!</li>
    <li> Great soap with no fragrance. Especially good if you have any skin problems.</li>
    <li> just love this stuff for keeping the face oil-free. Nice size to have in the shower.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for years.  The pump dispenser works well and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena is good stuff, and this 4-pack was a good price.</li>
    <li> Works well my daughter is entering her teenage years and this product is clearing her face and keeping it clean.</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast, and such a great deal. I love this facial cleanser, skin feels so smooth and clean after using it.  I have severe allergies, and it is hard to find fragrance-free products which this happens to be.  I have been using it for about a year, but bought it locally at a higher price.  I had been using a higher priced brand but like this one much better.  Have fewer problems with pimples, blackheads, etc. My face has never felt this clean before.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 10 years.  It is gentle and never leaves my face feeling tight.  I like the liquid form - no losing product sitting on the shelf when the shower runs!</li>
    <li> Why can&#x27;t you buy the delicious smelling Liquid Neutrogena anymore?  Fragrance Free has kind of a tree bark kind of scent which is intolerable.  I&#x27;ve started using it for everything from cleaning my feet to washing my makeup brushes just to work through my 4-pack as quickly as possible.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Fragrance Free Liquid Facial Cleansing Formula is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need pump tons of it. little bit of this stuff will do.&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels better and there is do residue.</li>
    <li> My order arrived early and I was very pleased with the product and price very reasonable and I would definitely purchase through this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have been using it for many years.</li>
    <li> Consistent product quality shows which companies we can rely on</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. The soap leaves a refreshing and clean feel.The pump bottle dispenses exactly what you need to your hand.I hate the soapy scum left on dishes by bar soap. This is a first rate product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and this shipment was just what I expected at a great price.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 25 years or more. These are a little pricey but they have become almost impossible to find at local retailers. Product is as advertized.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last 20+ years.  I first bought this at Walgreen&#x27;s then Costco until they quit carrying the product.  I have for the last three years bought the product from Amazon.  I hope that Neutrogena does not stop producing this product.  All too often a company will try to \\&quot;IMPROVE\\&quot; only to ruin the product and so lose customers because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face even now is still very sensitive and oily.  This really cleans my face without drying out my skin. Neutrogena keep making this product.  Don&#x27;t ruin it by trying to improve it.</li>
    <li> We use this all the time.</li>
    <li> I just couldn&#x27;t pass up the price. Great deal if you use this soap!</li>
    <li> my favorite hand soap.</li>
    <li> I am glad you had it available!!</li>
    <li> Neturogena is always a great product, kind of costly, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and won&#x27;t use anything else to cleanse my skin.  I am glad that it hasn&#x27;t disappeared from the market.</li>
    <li> I tend not to like fragrances, so this particular face soap works well in that it does not have a fragrance, it lathers nicely, and it leaves the skin on my face clean without feeling dry afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling dry.  &amp;#34;Fragrance free&amp;#34; means no fragrances have been added.  It does have a soapy smell to it.</li>
    <li> Been using it for at least 15 years and it is the only thing that would wash my face. Cuts oil and gunk but yet doesn&#x27;t hack me all to pieces. It has a smell (like &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; or something) but I am allergic to literally everything and this does not cause me problems.</li>
    <li> Clean, original face wash</li>
    <li> I have used and ordered this product before and love it.  Local stores have discontinued it or run out extremely fast.  I also save money by ordering in quantity and this means I always have a back up.  This is an excellent product for my sensitive skin.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for years too!! I have sensitive and combination skin. I had been trying tons of different cleansers out there for years, high end, drug store brands, scented, unscented, cream, milk, gel, scrub all different textures, chemical, natural, you name them. Nothing I would repurchase, until I met this product!!!! I used up at least 12 bottles in the past 3 years. I use it to wash my face twice a day, morning and night. I feel utter clean and fresh after each wash with NO irritation. But you can&#x27;t skip moisturizer. Overall, I will definitely keep buying and using it for a long term, and maybe pass on to my next generation. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: it works perfectly as a makeup brush cleanser as well!</li>
    <li> These items arrived broken and leaking soap everywhere.</li>
    <li> I buy this soap 4-6 bottles at a time via Amazon.  Was glad to see them arrive quickly and in good shape.  Super stoked on this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have combination/oily skin.  I have tried many cleansers over the years.  Many would clear my skin, but dry out the drier areas of my face leaving me with patchy skin.  This cleanser makes my skin feel wonderful and clean.  It doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling tight and dry.  Also there are no more patches.</li>
    <li> works well, great value, don&#x27;t need to go to CVS to buy it...so much easier</li>
    <li> Great product - have used it for years.  Great price on Prime.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price!!  Much cheaper than stores or even Wallmart.  Best price around that I have found.  Well worth buying in bulk.</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena soap on my face and body for years.  It is one of the only facial soaps that is fragrance free and totally non-irritating.  I plan to keep using it and really like it a lot!</li>
    <li> My wife and I both love Neutrogena facial cleanser! It leaves no noticeable residue, does not have any fragrance (I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances) and does a great job of cleaning the skin. For more than 10 years now this the only facial cleanser I use.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Love it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. My wife has used it as long as I&#x27;ve known her. We&#x27;ve been married 48 years so far. She used to buy it at Wal Mart, but got tired of their constant shuffling products around so you felt you were on an Easter egg hunt. Far too frequently they were out of stock anyway. Now she order&#x27;s  6 bottles at a time from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for the last 12 years and very happy with it. Very good for people with allergies or persons who get acne.</li>
    <li> Ordered many time. This is a great product!!</li>
    <li> my choice for oily skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years!</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin type so I have to be very careful with any product I use. Neutrogena Face Cleansing does not irritate my skin, always leaving a feeling of total cleanliness and refreshment.</li>
    <li> Liquid Neutrogena is by far the best facial soap that I have used in over 50 of being aware of facial beauty. I purchased this product at Walgreens, but from now on from AMAZON, as they seem to have a great pricing deal. After only a few applications I can see my face rejuvenated and I love that as I still date and I want to look the best as I can for my one &amp; only boyfriend.  He has already complimented me on my more youthful look. 5 Stars</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and the recipient loved  told me that he was very, very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Frangence Free Liquid Facial Cleansing Soap. It is gentle on my skin, yet removes any excess oil.&lt;br /&gt; Neutrogena Liquid Soap is nice to use because I know it is good for my skin, and does a good job of cleansing it. I have very oily skin on my forehead, around my nose, and chin, and very dry skin on the rest of my face. Upon a friend&#x27;s good recommendation, I started using Neutrogena Frangence Free Liquid Facial Cleansing Soap. I have been very happy with it and plan to continue to use this soap the rest of my life. I use Frangence Free  because I do not want to put any additional chemicals on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very old fashioned about certain things and use this one product instead of soap and as a shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a decade and love it.</li>
    <li> Good price and good quality</li>
    <li> Convenient and economical.</li>
    <li> I wear a CPAP mask and it is important to wash my face each night and get all oily residue removed before I put my mask on.  Liquid Neutrogena is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for that purpose.  It also does a great job when I manually have to clean the CPAP mask each week.  Everyone in my situation should use it!</li>
