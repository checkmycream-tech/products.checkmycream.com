      <li>I never thought I&#x27;d get so excited about soap, but I love this!</li>
      <li>This is our favorite wintertime bar soap.  </li>
      <li>and I must say I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>This soap was very, very rich, creamy and lathered much better than my  Palmer&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>The soap bar is huge and very easy to use.</li>
      <li>so I was hoping to get the great results in others&#x27; comments about how it made their skin feel so soft and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product because it&#x27;s effective &amp; lasts long.</li>
      <li>I started using this soap bar about two weeks ago and it has already made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>I am dewy smooth as I write this.  </li>
      <li>They smell really good and do work to clear up skin.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this soap for my face.  </li>
      <li>It goes on creamy &amp; rinses off clean leaving my skin feeling moisturized.</li>
      <li>This is by far the most amazing and natural soap I have ever used and trust me I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;It smells delicious and leaves my skin clean and soft, not dry at all.</li>
      <li>Not over powering, latered great and left me feeling pretty silky.  </li>
      <li>I do appreciate that the bar smells nice &amp; mild - not heavily scented.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, the shell bits are a good exfoliant, and it is lasting a long time.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll see if I can convince my self to keep spending 5 dollars for a bar of soap, although, with this one I think it&#x27;s actually worth it.</li>
      <li>but so worth it.</li>
      <li>Immediately, I noticed soft, moisturized skin that felt clean and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a difference in my skin right away.</li>
      <li>but very, very pricey.</li>
      <li>You will feel so soft, fresh and clean after using is bar.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get me as clean as the old shea butter</li>
      <li>It also lathers &amp; cleans really good leaving no residue behind, plus it&#x27;s chemical &amp; cruelty free</li>
      <li>and since they lather so well, are great for shave soap also (however, the Shea Moisture brand of shave soaps/creams is not good).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed so much improvement in my skin&#x27;s moisture balance &amp; tone.</li>
      <li>is too much.</li>
      <li>This is not what I really wanted but it will do.</li>
      <li>Then, I stopped using it abruptly and needed to apply more lotion.</li>
      <li>I tried goat milk soap and other natural alternatives being this my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>So, I sent whatshisname into a Wag&#x27;s (not in our neighborhood) to pick up a few things and asked him to grab a couple bars of my longtime favorite, Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter.  </li>
      <li>I normally buy at Walgreens or CVS.</li>
      <li>It is gentle yet cleanses your skin like no other soap I have seen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in LOVE with the African Black soap (cured my plaque psoriasis)</li>
      <li>Originally I had been using the African Black Soap which I really like also, but I wanted to try something new.</li>
      <li>, it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your skin, it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty large bar &amp; after using it for a month it&#x27;s not quite half way gone.</li>
      <li>Of this brand, I&#x27;ve only tried the African Black Soap otherwise, but I think this Coconut and Hibiscus is much better.</li>
      <li>I bought this at Target this past Saturday for $3.63, used it the following morning and fell in love with is.</li>
      <li>When the air is dry, this soap is moisturizing and gentle.</li>
      <li>At first, to me the smell (dry) smelled similar to playdoh, but after it was wet</li>
      <li>This soap is very moisturizing because it never leaves my face feeling tight.</li>

    <li> Originally I had been using the African Black Soap which I really like also, but I wanted to try something new. So I&#x27;ve been testing this Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Shea Butter soap for a month. I use it twice daily on my face. I&#x27;ve noticed so much improvement in my skin&#x27;s moisture balance &amp; tone. This soap is very moisturizing because it never leaves my face feeling tight. It also lathers &amp; cleans really good leaving no residue behind, plus it&#x27;s chemical &amp; cruelty free which is awesome. I do appreciate that the bar smells nice &amp; mild - not heavily scented. This is a pretty large bar &amp; after using it for a month it&#x27;s not quite half way gone. This is a great product because it&#x27;s effective &amp; lasts long. You know something works when people from all over just starts giving you compliments on your skin !</li>
    <li> SM shea butter soaps are the best soaps I&#x27;ve ever tried.  They actually moisturize w/o clogging pores or chemicals.  I originally got these for washing face, but they are good all over... and since they lather so well, are great for shave soap also (however, the Shea Moisture brand of shave soaps/creams is not good).</li>
    <li> looking for the perfect bath soap I have found Shea Moisture.  Soapy yet smooth with a pleasant odor and great for my wife&#x27;s sensitive skin.  As I said, the perfect soap!!</li>
    <li> I love this soap, amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. The end.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful.  Smells great. Bar lasts a long, long time. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, the shell bits are a good exfoliant, and it is lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t think of soap as being moisturizing but this one actually is. I noticed a difference in my skin right away. I used it for a few days and my skin felt instantly hydrated. Then, I stopped using it abruptly and needed to apply more lotion. It was like my skin couldn&#x27;t stop soaking in the lotion after I stopped using this soap. I might continue to use it even though the price is one of the reason I had never tried it before. It looks like it lasts long and taking it out of the shower area to keep it dry every time will probably help. We&#x27;ll see if I can convince my self to keep spending 5 dollars for a bar of soap, although, with this one I think it&#x27;s actually worth it.</li>
    <li> I started using this soap bar about two weeks ago and it has already made a huge difference in my skin. It is gentle yet cleanses your skin like no other soap I have seen. It leaves my skin toned and bright and refreshed. The soap bar is huge and very easy to use. I will recommend to anyone who wants flawless skin!</li>
    <li> So, I sent whatshisname into a Wag&#x27;s (not in our neighborhood) to pick up a few things and asked him to grab a couple bars of my longtime favorite, Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter.  Needless to say, they didn&#x27;t have the Palmers.  He saw the Shea Moisture label and knowing I used the hair products he bought the soap.  Pricey, but substantial I showered with  it the same night.  The scent was not as fragrant as the hair creme but very pleasant.  This soap was very, very rich, creamy and lathered much better than my  Palmer&#x27;s.  Immediately, I noticed soft, moisturized skin that felt clean and smooth.  I never use lotion or oil before bed but ALWAYS the next morning -  not the case.  No lotion or oil necessary.  I am dewy smooth as I write this.  I&#x27;d heard the hype about shea butter and just wrote it off as talk...in the form of soap, its a God send.  I recommend this soap OVER my favorite Palmer&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is our favorite wintertime bar soap.  When the air is dry, this soap is moisturizing and gentle.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap that I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve seen it at my Target store and decided to try it out. The scent is amazing, and it&#x27;s very rich and moisturizing. Of this brand, I&#x27;ve only tried the African Black Soap otherwise, but I think this Coconut and Hibiscus is much better.</li>
    <li> i LOVE THIS SOAP AND THE MATCHING BODY WASH.  Psoriasis is clearing up.  I use this and eat unsweetened apple sauce and a few carrots&lt;br /&gt;everyday and it&#x27;s disappearing. I bought another bar at Walgreens and lady checking me out said it was clearing her son&#x27;s eczema.  Plus he was eating organic apples.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with the African Black soap (cured my plaque psoriasis) so when I saw this one tonight I had to try it. ( btw walgreens 4.99) At first, to me the smell (dry) smelled similar to playdoh, but after it was wet the smell was great. Not over powering, latered great and left me feeling pretty silky.  Used the coconut hibiscus body lotion afterwards...amazing!  I&#x27;m a recent newcomer to the Shea moisture line and I must say I&#x27;m in love. Thank you, Customer for life.</li>
    <li> Will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> OMG this is some of the best soap I&#x27;ve ever tried! I bought this at Target this past Saturday for $3.63, used it the following morning and fell in love with is. You will feel so soft, fresh and clean after using is bar.  It&#x27;s up there with the Raw African black soap (I usually use for my face and sometimes body). A bit pricey for one bar but so worth it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this soap for my face.  I have dry skin so I was hoping to get the great results in others&#x27; comments about how it made their skin feel so soft and hydrated.  For me, this dried out my skin so terribly bad.  I used it in the morning and by 9:00 a.m. my skin was so dry it actually hurt.  And it also caused a redness to my face.  I had to put Aquaphor on my skin twice that day after washing my face again with some Cetaphil.  Very unfortunate it didn&#x27;t work for because I had high hopes.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d get so excited about soap, but I love this! It smells great but is not overpowering, it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your skin, it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals. I have a hard time finding soap that doesn&#x27;t contain animal by-products at my grocery store so I thought I&#x27;d buy some online. Now that I&#x27;ve used this soap I&#x27;ve seen it at a couple drug stores for cheaper. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used to buy their shea butter soap without the extras but they don&#x27;t make it anymore so I gave this a try. It doesn&#x27;t get me as clean as the old shea butter but it smells good and leaves my skin just as moisturized.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use any type of bar for cleaning anything. Especially my body. I don&#x27;t like how soap usually makes my skin feel (all dry &amp; caked). This bar doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry &amp; I don&#x27;t feel like I have residue all over. It goes on creamy &amp; rinses off clean leaving my skin feeling moisturized. I also like the little hard pieces through out it that, I think, helps release extra dead skin cells from your body.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most amazing and natural soap I have ever used and trust me I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;It smells delicious and leaves my skin clean and soft, not dry at all. I tried goat milk soap and other natural alternatives being this my absolute favorite. I buy it at my local store thou the price here is too much. TOTALLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> This soap is good for your face and body. This is not what I really wanted but it will do. The size of the soap last a long time.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! It&#x27;s great for moisture but that&#x27;s not why I use it.  My skin is so clear compared to when I use other soaps.  I usually get 2-3 pimples every month due to hormonal acne.  Not so with this bar. It also lightened my dark spots gradually so it didn&#x27;t look like I got a crazy peel done over night. Great product...but very, very pricey.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome prodcut. They smell really good and do work to clear up skin. I normally buy at Walgreens or CVS. I went to Amazon to see if I could order some to stock up. I&#x27;m shocked by the price for one bar. These are $4.99 per bar at Walgreens.com. Amazon needs to lower the pricing. $15 for one bar of soap, as much as I like it, is ridiculous!</li>
