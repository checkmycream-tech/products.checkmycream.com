      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this acne treatment kit...</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with the results we have experienced so far!</li>
      <li>First, it smells good.</li>
      <li>After just TWO days, we&#x27;ve already seen a significant improvement!</li>
      <li>Very good overall product.</li>
      <li>Feels light like a moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t sting like most acne treatments.</li>
      <li>It was refreshing, soothing and light.  </li>
      <li>First thing I really liked and noticed about these products is the lack of smell.</li>
      <li>To be fair, we&#x27;ve only used it two days, so I&#x27;m unsure yet about any irritation or problems he may experience with use, but we see quick results and are very pleased.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and we WILL be purchasing it again in the future!</li>
      <li>IT DOES NOT LATHER BECAUSE ITS SOAP FREE..</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
      <li>My acne flare ups have significantly reduced and the ones I have are going away.</li>
      <li>I was so excited</li>
      <li>I leaves my face feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I actually found this to be more effective than the time I used proactive.  </li>
      <li>This has just a clean smell.</li>
      <li>but it is more effective than the simple salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide solutions out</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m unsure if this is true or not.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this set.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my teenage son because it had really good reviews on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I feel comfortable enough in my own skin to leave the house without make up on (which I haven done in about a year).</li>
      <li>However it is super silky feeling</li>
      <li>I can use it am and pm because it dries quick and is translucent</li>
      <li>It made my skin so smooth after the first use.</li>
      <li>My face isn&#x27;t completely cleared but it looks 85% better than it did before I received the product.</li>
      <li>I am optimistic that after more use, it will clear up.</li>
      <li>so I can put my makeup right over it.  </li>
      <li>But most importantly the products did not clear my skin any.</li>
      <li>Sometimes acne washes can smell very strong or almost medical grade.</li>
      <li>so maybe it would work better for someone who doesn&#x27;t have oily skin and only mild acne.</li>
      <li>That itself is a huge improvement with so many other products she had tried.</li>
      <li>The first step is the wash.</li>
      <li>I was definitely someone who would be considered to have &amp;quot;severe acne&amp;quot;, and it took awhile longer to work than most people.  </li>
      <li>Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve been recommending it to pretty much everyone with acne.  </li>
      <li>The finishing treatment adds vitamins etc and keeps the skin super soft etc.</li>
      <li>I only wash with this product once a day because of how strong it it</li>
      <li>Works fast too.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my face since I started using this twice a day.  </li>
      <li>This item has really helped me control my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, doesn&#x27;t feel like the cleanser is really cleaning my face........</li>
      <li>I found this product worked very well.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and the products don&#x27;t seem to keep the oil at bay.</li>
      <li>The cleanser is also not irritating and leaves the face refreshed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun (proactive, murad, Clinique..etc) and nothing&#x27;s really worked for the cysts.</li>
      <li>the complexion of the skin on my forehead and cheeks is much improved.</li>
      <li>It has given me better results than any other system i have used.</li>
      <li>Her face feels super soft and not dried out after using the product.</li>
      <li>My skin cleared up after the first week of using it and was completely clear after 2-weeks.</li>
      <li>I still have remnants from my teen years and although it is no nearly as bad</li>
      <li>After using this product for several weeks my skin is smooth and clear with no redness or irritation.</li>
      <li>I was anxious to try this as it has had great feedback, with the non-irritating formula especially drawing my interest, as I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for problem skin</li>
      <li>Highly recommend trying this.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Recently I came across a review on Clean and Clear Pera-gel10 and thought it would work for me</li>
      <li>It really helped with my bouts of adult acne break outs particularly this time of year when summer emphasizes the inflammation of my skin.  </li>
      <li>He has adult acne and nothing has ever really worked for him.</li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s nothing on line because product is so new)  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used almost everything for my acne including Proactiv and nothing has worked, until I started using Neutralyze. By far the best product for my skin. I highly recommend it for problem skin</li>
    <li> This item has really helped me control my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> I found this product worked very well.  There is not a strong fragrance to it and a little bit goes a long way.  It really helped with my bouts of adult acne break outs particularly this time of year when summer emphasizes the inflammation of my skin.  I started using just the spot treatment alone but quickly found the best results were to use as directed.  It was refreshing, soothing and light.  Very good overall product.</li>
    <li> This seems to dry out my acne quicker, but it isn&#x27;t keeping it from popping up. I&#x27;m still getting acne... from tiny little ones to Mt St Helens.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to review. I have tried other similar systems like proactive and they work for a little while and then my face breaks out again. This set has cleared up my acne. My face does not feel overly dry even though the product is helping with the breakouts. It does not have any weird smells like some other products have. I leaves my face feeling clean and moisturized. Hopefully it continues to fight my breakouts.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic!  Nothing out there comes close!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Cleared up my face!</li>
    <li> My skin is finally clear after trying multiple products for years. This system truly works. My skin cleared up after the first week of using it and was completely clear after 2-weeks. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews but typically don&#x27;t leave a review, however this deserves attention. My 14 year old son has moderate acne on his face, neck, and back, we&#x27;ve tried nearly everything, even prescriptions.  Doctors have told us it&#x27;s typical teenage acne which we can try to control but that&#x27;s all. I agree somewhat, teenage boys get acne. But NOTHING has helped. School is starting soon, and he&#x27;s understandably beginning to be bothered by it and even embarrassed.  After reading reviews for this product, I figured what could it hurt. After just TWO days, we&#x27;ve already seen a significant improvement! I have one very happy teenage son! To be fair, we&#x27;ve only used it two days, so I&#x27;m unsure yet about any irritation or problems he may experience with use, but we see quick results and are very pleased.</li>
    <li> When I have a pimple this is my go-to product! I like that I can use it am and pm because it dries quick and is translucent so I can put my makeup right over it.  Feels light like a moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t sting like most acne treatments. I definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this set. My daughter is at the start of minor acne, at age 11. We&#x27;ve been on several different products and medicines since the age of 9 and had not had the results we hoped. She noticed an immediate difference with the cleanser. First, it smells good. That itself is a huge improvement with so many other products she had tried. The cleanser is also not irritating and leaves the face refreshed. I notice the acne redness has subsided after just a few uses. The Spot Corrector is great and I love the pump dispenser. The breakouts have not stopped yet, however there is a noticeable improvement. I am optimistic that after more use, it will clear up. I am so pleased with the results we have experienced so far!</li>
    <li> I have PCOS which causes horrendous flare ups of cystic acne all along my jawline. It is not only ugly and hard to cover, it&#x27;s also incredibly painful and takes forever to heal. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Proactiv to cheaper drug store acne treatments. Recently I came across a review on Clean and Clear Pera-gel10 and thought it would work for me but instead it burnt my skin and left me with red patches AND unsightly dry skin... and did nothing for the acne. I had the opportunity to try Neutralyze at a discounted price so I thought what do I have to lose? Within 2 days my skin showed improvement! My cystic acne had started to heal and the terrible red and dry patches were already going away. My only complaint? Price and size. I wish the bottles were bigger and  a 30 day supply wasn&#x27;t nearly $40. On the upside, on Facebook they usually offer codes to get it for about $20. I absolutely love this acne treatment kit... it&#x27;s the only thing that truly works for my complicated skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> So far, we&#x27;ve used it twice per day for the last three says.  And I will say I&#x27;ve seen a great improvement.  We&#x27;ve had a run of products, but this system has been the best!</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff!!! It made my skin so smooth after the first use. I only wash with this product once a day because of how strong it it and I don&#x27;t want to dry out my face.</li>
    <li> Since I started using Neutralyze a few months ago, my skin is literally completely different now.  I was definitely someone who would be considered to have &amp;quot;severe acne&amp;quot;, and it took awhile longer to work than most people.  I would say that I saw it starting to get a little better after 2 weeks, and then after 4, 6, 8 weeks it just kept slowly fading away.  Even the acne scars look a lot smoother and the other blotches I had are pretty much disappeared.  Even a few of my friends are using this stuff after they saw how well it worked for me, I&#x27;ve been recommending it to pretty much everyone with acne.  Neutralyze is awesome and I&#x27;m so thankful to have found this product.</li>
    <li> Neutralyze is a phenomenal product. With all the treatments that are out there it&#x27;s the only one where I see quick and lasting results.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have never felt better in my own skin!! Highly recommend trying this.</li>
    <li> So far I like this acne treatment kit.  One of my bottles arrived with no lid so that bothered me a bit.  The wash seems to do a good job and even removed some of my make up.  Next time I would remove my make up before using though.  Next I used the spot treatment and it burned in the areas that I had acne.  The synergyzer feels mostly like aloe vera gel.  The box says that the synergyzer pulls everything together and gives your skin a visibly improved condition.  I&#x27;m unsure if this is true or not.  I don&#x27;t have bad acne but I do suffer from adult acne so I&#x27;m hoping this will help clear it up.  The bottles are small so I will probably only use this when I have acne, not daily.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this product I have seen a slight improvement ...but I only like the spot treatment , doesn&#x27;t feel like the cleanser is really cleaning my face........won&#x27;t be reordering</li>
    <li> This is a good set for someone with acne.  I still have remnants from my teen years and although it is no nearly as bad it is still present.  This does a great job of getting rid of it.  I actually found this to be more effective than the time I used proactive.  This is also cheaper.  Not quite sure what mandelic acid is but it is more effective than the simple salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide solutions out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a promotional price of this product in order to conduct a review.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my teenage son and he instantly opened it and read all the literature.  Then googled (but there&#x27;s nothing on line because product is so new)  He decided to try it anyways and has been very pleased with the results. He started to see results within a few days and continues to use it.</li>
    <li> Neutralyze is so great. Very gentle yet very effective. Works fast too. I&#x27;ve had Great results with this.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my two teenagers. They have both used it and said they can definitely tell a difference after using it. My daughter has extremely sensitive skin and just about everything she has used has irritated it. That isn&#x27;t the case with this product. Her face feels super soft and not dried out after using the product. My son is always complaining that his skin feels dry in places and oily in other areas when he has used other products. As with my daughter, he said he didn&#x27;t feel dried out, nor did he feel oily. His skin is also soft. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a month but nothing change for my acne。&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And step 2 have very strong smell，like Alcohol？</li>
    <li> I had severe acne as a teen and have continued to have adult acne, mainly on my chin. I have used multiple products (proactiv, acnefree, prescription) with mixed results. I was anxious to try this as it has had great feedback, with the non-irritating formula especially drawing my interest, as I have sensitive skin. The good is, I have noticed the acne on my forehead is diminished and the complexion of the skin on my forehead and cheeks is much improved. The bad.....I have had a severe breakout, or purge, on my chin. I have not experienced acne this severe since I was a teenager. I know from using other products that this can be normal as it brings impurities to the surface, but needless to say it has been tough to &amp;#34;ride out the storm&amp;#34;. I have used it twice a day as directed and will continue to use as directed in hopes it will improve. Wondering if others had similar experiences?</li>
    <li> After using this product for several weeks my skin is smooth and clear with no redness or irritation. I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> My daughter and son (both teenagers) started using this product about a week ago. 2 days later we saw a difference and now a week later we see a huge difference - These are softer on the skin and easier to put on then the other treatments. We are hooked and will be ordering them again</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my face since I started using this twice a day.  My face hasn&#x27;t broken out much since this product arrived, so I can&#x27;t give a very accurate review at this point.  I will come back and update the review after using this product for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> First thing I really liked and noticed about these products is the lack of smell. Sometimes acne washes can smell very strong or almost medical grade. This has just a clean smell. I really liked that step two was a gel toner and not liquid also it didn&#x27;t bleach my shirt!! Almost all face toners tend to bleach our night shirts and I hate that. This was a real win for me. Only down fall was when I skipped using it for a few days I did beak out but that could have been hormonal. I have already started to recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the celebrity endorsed products.  This one actually works.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not really impressed with this product. The active ingredient, salicylic acid, is only found in the spot treatment and is only concentrated at 1%. I can say the products do feel refreshing on my face. Thr face wash is soothing and so are the other two products, which are a gel like substance. I have very oily skin and the products don&#x27;t seem to keep the oil at bay. But most importantly the products did not clear my skin any. My acne is severe so maybe it would work better for someone who doesn&#x27;t have oily skin and only mild acne.</li>
    <li> my face is always red and i have been using this product for 3 days now. It is amazing. It is a three step system. The first step is the wash. IT DOES NOT LATHER BECAUSE ITS SOAP FREE.. However it is super silky feeling amd gets the oils/dirt off your face without drying it out. The second step is the spot treatment. I put a thin layer over my entire face as i have acne all over my face. It does smell like alcohol because its the spot treatment. It does wonders. The third step is the finishing serum which is exactly like the spot treatment. I only use three sqirts of the spot treatment and finishing treatment and put a thin layer on my entire face. The finishing treatment adds vitamins etc and keeps the skin super soft etc. I will be purchasing this treatment again and will definitely be recommending this to people. I think it may be better than proactive. It has gotten rid of the redness and dryness in my face in just 3 days. It has given me better results than any other system i have used. I give it an amazing 10 stars!</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommended for anyone with moderate to severe acne.</li>
    <li> Neutralize Is by far the best product for acne/blemishes.  I have been using this for almost a year and my skin has never been clearer.  Not only does it work on blemishes, but it leaves my skin feeling refreshed. It does not irritate or dry out my face.  I highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Best acne product out there by far.  My face has never looked so good.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband. He has adult acne and nothing has ever really worked for him. I&#x27;m AMAZED at how well this acne system is working!!!!! It took a few weeks for it to start really helping and it got worse before it got better... but IT WORKS!!!!!!!!! This is a great product and we WILL be purchasing it again in the future!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage son because it had really good reviews on Amazon. So far there seems to be a dramatic difference in his complexion. Would recommend this product to anybody that had an  acne problem</li>
    <li> The day before I recieved this product, I had two cystic acne spots (as well a some pimples here and there on my face) that started to appear and I was like, oh this will be perfect to see how well neutralyze dose on cysts. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun (proactive, murad, Clinique..etc) and nothing&#x27;s really worked for the cysts. I was so excited when my box arrived, I put it to use immediately that night before I went to bed. I was amazed at the results just a day later. Those two pesky cystic acne spots I had literally stopped growing in their tracks and as I continued to use the product 2x a day, they went away and I haven&#x27;t seen them since! My acne flare ups have significantly reduced and the ones I have are going away. Since I started using neutralyze, my confidence has gone up and I feel comfortable enough in my own skin to leave the house without make up on (which I haven done in about a year). My face isn&#x27;t completely cleared but it looks 85% better than it did before I received the product. This is my story about neutralyze and I can&#x27;t say enough about the product!</li>
