### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best toothpaste to use for electric toothbrushes in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>The product is excellent, we&#x27;ve used Colgate for years, but the innovation is in the container.  </li>
      <li>Very happy with delivery of product.</li>
      <li>Of course, to get a great price, you have to get a pack of five - which is perfect.</li>
      <li>These are extremely great and neat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got it at a great price.  </li>
      <li>Tastes Great.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I am so happy to be able to buy in bulk.</li>
      <li>I love the minty fresh breath this toothpaste leaves and it taste great.  </li>
      <li>A much more enjoyable experience than toothpaste.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Cool Mint\\&quot; flavor is wonderfully great and cool.  </li>
      <li>If you love that \\&quot;cold\\&quot; feeling after brushing your teeth, then this toothpaste flavor is for you.  </li>
      <li>The added mini breath strips are a plus that should be utilized more often.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste and can&#x27;t always find this in the store.</li>
      <li>Tastes good and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.  </li>
      <li>Refreshing and foamy when brushing</li>
      <li>It foams up nicely and dispenses cleanly out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>Additionally, the max fresh cool mint is great tasting.</li>
      <li>This is great stuff - no messy toothpaste tube with an end to roll up.  </li>
      <li>and the product is instantly available to squeeze onto the toothbrush with good control - you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
      <li>As a product, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>you love that strong fresh mint feeling and are going to be close to others</li>
      <li>It is occasionally available at the dollar tree for one dollar.  </li>
      <li>Our teeth are clean and have been cavity free to this point.</li>
      <li>Have t constantly clean it manually with paper towel...</li>
      <li>Grocery stores and super stores have a hundred brands of toothpaste, particularly tube toothpaste.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a replacement for your recall exams with your favorite dentist in no way, but rather up-keep until your next check up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes brushing your teeth a positive experience to look forward to every day and night.</li>
      <li>I guess everyone at the office will get a new laugh on me, &amp;#34;Now</li>
      <li>and you get every last drop with easy.</li>
      <li>Really works.</li>
      <li>Much cleaner than a tube.  </li>
      <li>We also find it very useful to keep the bottle upside down so that the paste flows quickly onto the brush.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to get enthusiastic about toothpaste, but one does use it multiple times daily and this is much better than the tube.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>For those who have never used this style, it is meant to be stored upside down so that the paste comes out easily.</li>
      <li>My hubby at times can have \\&quot;stinky\\&quot; breath and when he uses the mini breath strips line, his breath is minty fresh for so much longer than with conventional toothpastes.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of toothpaste on the actual brush while using the \\&quot;Colgate Max\\&quot; line, which is another added incentive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is difficult to find a store with good variety of this type.</li>
      <li>It lasts a very long time, and with a flat top you store it upside down</li>
      <li>In regard to the product, it can be quite a challenge to get the toothpaste out of a tube especially as you get near the end of the tube.</li>
      <li>Love the color but wish it was a little less runny.</li>

    <li> I love this toothpaste and can&#x27;t always find this in the store. I am so happy to be able to buy in bulk.</li>

    <li> I have reviewed another toothpaste and mentioned how lazy we are in using screw caps to flip tops on the conventional tubes.  These are extremely great and neat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Cool Mint\\&quot; flavor is wonderfully great and cool.  If you love that \\&quot;cold\\&quot; feeling after brushing your teeth, then this toothpaste flavor is for you.  The added mini breath strips are a plus that should be utilized more often.  My hubby at times can have \\&quot;stinky\\&quot; breath and when he uses the mini breath strips line, his breath is minty fresh for so much longer than with conventional toothpastes. Our teeth are clean and have been cavity free to this point. There is no plaque build up or discoloration. This isn&#x27;t a replacement for your recall exams with your favorite dentist in no way, but rather up-keep until your next check up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bottle will last us about a month and a half.  At the current price point on Amazon, they are a STEAL!  Local drugstores rip me off to the tune of 3.99 a bottle.  We also find it very useful to keep the bottle upside down so that the paste flows quickly onto the brush.  You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of toothpaste on the actual brush while using the \\&quot;Colgate Max\\&quot; line, which is another added incentive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love that strong fresh mint feeling and are going to be close to others then this is the stuff to buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> As a product, it&#x27;s fine.  I purchased this in quantity as I like the stand-up container and they&#x27;re hard to find.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would highly recommend this product.  It is occasionally available at the dollar tree for one dollar.  Buying this way is cheaper than other stores though.</li>
    <li> Really works. Cant use traditional toothpaste anymore. My roommate asked if she could start splitting the cost as she prefers it over her tube brand.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste to use for electric toothbrushes in my opinion.  It foams up nicely and dispenses cleanly out of the bottle. Much cleaner than a tube.  It tastes quite minty as well.</li>
    <li> Tastes Great.  I prefer his type of container.  It can be difficult to find at times, so I decided to check availability on Amazon.  HAH!  Not only do they have it on Prime, at six containers for $16.29, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I guess everyone at the office will get a new laugh on me, &amp;#34;Now, he&#x27;s getting his toothpaste from Amazon.&amp;#34;  Heck, yeah, just another thing I can avoid Wal-Mart for.</li>
    <li> Very happy with delivery of product.Will use again.</li>
    <li> A much more enjoyable experience than toothpaste. Makes brushing your teeth a positive experience to look forward to every day and night.</li>
    <li> Refreshing and foamy when brushing</li>
    <li> Tastes good and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.  I got it at a great price.  I personally like this style of dispenser.  Although, like all of the brands that use this, it can become difficult to close the lid, especially if the toothpaste builds up at the closure.  For those who have never used this style, it is meant to be stored upside down so that the paste comes out easily.</li>

You have to turn to Amazon for this. Of course, to get a great price, you have to get a pack of five - which is perfect. In regard to the product, it can be quite a challenge to get the toothpaste out of a tube especially as you get near the end of the tube. With this version of the product, you just keep it sitting on the cap and you get every last drop with easy. Additionally, the max fresh cool mint is great tasting.</li>
    <li> I love the minty fresh breath this toothpaste leaves and it taste great.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and prefer it over the tube toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is the toothpaste I&#x27;ve been using for the last 10 years and I never had problems with my teeth. I will never change.</li>
    <li> Love the color but wish it was a little less runny.</li>
