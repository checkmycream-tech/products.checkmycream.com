### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>Soaking my brushes in this product was the best idea I ever had.</li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to deal with a return but a replacment would have been nice.</li>
      <li>I havent used it yet, but I will update this review when I use it, but so far I am happy with it!!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure this company can do better with that.</li>
      <li>It just smells and seems like a strong nail polish remover to me.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s totally my fault for not knowing my math lol.</li>
      <li>this product is pretty inexpensive, and arrived at my house 6 days after I ordered it!!</li>
      <li>It does the job, my brushes are clean.</li>
      <li>I thought I wouldn&#x27;t ever be able to use those particular brushes again</li>
      <li>Got like a quarter of the bottle and pure acetone works just fine</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s purpose is to clean the brush bristles and it does exactly that.</li>
      <li>Brushes are left in excellent condition afterwards and are ready for use the next time.</li>
      <li>Got one good use out of it before it was empty.</li>
      <li>but after soaking them for about five minutes all the acrylic goop soaked right off</li>
      <li>Someone had mentioned the fact that this takes the paint right off brushes and they were right,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good so little through.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
      <li>however I don&#x27;t really mind b/c</li>
      <li>Payed way to much for it.</li>
      <li>To mush money for really smal size</li>
      <li>but I am very upset because a lot of it leaked in the packaging</li>
      <li>I have to go back and use acetone to get them clean.</li>
      <li>Received this bottle only 1/4 full.</li>
      <li>Cleans the brushes off very fast with no mess.</li>
      <li>, so I think it should be packaged a little better.</li>
      <li>After years and years of buying new brushes to do my nails, I came across this</li>
      <li>Didnt realize the bottle was so tiny ran out to quick I just use acetone now works the same and fastet</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t waste so much and now It lasts much longer</li>
      <li>Finally got this in the mail and apparently there was a hole somewhere in the bottle</li>
      <li>tiny ammount, and all it is, is acetone alcohol and a scent add-in to calm down the harsh smell - d.i.y youll get 10x as much for the same price, the same day at sallys or walmart (acetone $2 for 16 oz and alcohol $1 for 16 oz WALMART)</li>

<li> The smell is a little strong but it&#x27;s not overwhelming and it gets the job done.</li>
<li> I find this product cleans paint out of brush but not completely.</li>
<li> When I received it a little bit had poured out already(being that it&#x27;s so tiny that sucked</li>
<li> Bottle was empty upon receipt.</li>
<li> but they sent me the bottle open so a lot was wasted.</li>
<li> I have received other liquid that did not spill out before the package reached me</li>
<li> Just got my order and the bottle was empty!</li>
<li> and it was already half empty!</li>
<li> When I got my package half the cleaner leaked out</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if the cleaner sucks or the brushes suck or if I am just letting the acrylic dry</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think it spilled or leaked as I couldn&#x27;t smell it until the cap was off, but it was not worth ordering as it is a small bottle already.</li>
<li> Not sure how to use, but does not work for me</li>
<li> I started to save the product and a small glass jar</li>
<li> (they&#x27;d been put to the side for at least a year)</li>
<li> Not happy at all.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not happy at all.</li>
<li> Very disappointed bottle came half empty</li>
<li> The sad part is that it had a foil seal.</li>
<li> Very disappointed half the bottle was spilled inside the ziploc  baggie</li>
<li> Obama  disappointed.</li>

<ol>
    <li> This does not take all of the acrylic off of my brushes, but it does recondition them after I&#x27;ve soaked them in acetone to remove the acrylic. I don&#x27;t know if the cleaner sucks or the brushes suck or if I am just letting the acrylic dry and that&#x27;s the problem? I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> Just got my order and the bottle was empty! What a rip off!</li>
    <li> tiny ammount, and all it is, is acetone alcohol and a scent add-in to calm down the harsh smell - d.i.y youll get 10x as much for the same price, the same day at sallys or walmart (acetone $2 for 16 oz and alcohol $1 for 16 oz WALMART)</li>
    <li> Very disappointed half the bottle was spilled inside the ziploc  baggie it came in. The sad part is that it had a foil seal. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>

    <li> To mush money for really smal size 😒</li>
    <li> this is actually the second bottle I purchased I started to save the product and a small glass jar so I didn&#x27;t waste so much and now It lasts much longer</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t at all what I wanted. I searched for acrylic liquid and this is what I got. I&#x27;m not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Bottle was empty upon receipt.</li>
    <li> The cap came off and the contents evaporated during shipping.</li>
    <li> Didnt realize the bottle was so tiny ran out to quick I just use acetone now works the same and fastet</li>
    <li> This product was a disaster! The liquid was all over the place omg it sucked!</li>
    <li> It just smells and seems like a strong nail polish remover to me. I got this in and it was almost gone before I ever opened it. I don&#x27;t want to deal with a return but a replacment would have been nice. Oh well.</li>
    <li> i received a different product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good so little through. Sallys has bigger ones</li>
    <li> I rate the cleaner a 4 because I wish it was bigger but it&#x27;s totally my fault for not knowing my math lol. However it does what it is suppose to. When I received it a little bit had poured out already(being that it&#x27;s so tiny that sucked some was gone), so I think it should be packaged a little better. I have received other liquid that did not spill out before the package reached me so I&#x27;m sure this company can do better with that.</li>
    <li> Someone had mentioned the fact that this takes the paint right off brushes and they were right, however I don&#x27;t really mind b/c it&#x27;s purpose is to clean the brush bristles and it does exactly that. The smell is a little strong but it&#x27;s not overwhelming and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Not happy at all. Received this bottle only 1/4 full. I don&#x27;t think it spilled or leaked as I couldn&#x27;t smell it until the cap was off, but it was not worth ordering as it is a small bottle already. Ended up getting about a teaspoon of the product.</li>
    <li> After years and years of buying new brushes to do my nails, I came across this and I love it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed bottle came half empty</li>
    <li> It does the job, my brushes are clean. I don&#x27;t know about stripping the paint off the handle or stick because mine are all plastic.</li>
    <li> Not sure how to use, but does not work for me</li>
    <li> Cleans brushes sufficiently, however, the bottle is significantly smaller than I realized.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Cleans the brushes off very fast with no mess. Brushes are left in excellent condition afterwards and are ready for use the next time. Also arrived on time. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this product is pretty inexpensive, and arrived at my house 6 days after I ordered it!! i was expecting it to take longer... I havent used it yet, but I will update this review when I use it, but so far I am happy with it!!</li>
    <li> I needed some brush cleaner and i have yet to use it but I am very upset because a lot of it leaked in the packaging</li>
    <li> Finally got this in the mail and apparently there was a hole somewhere in the bottle and it was already half empty! Got one good use out of it before it was empty. Payed way to much for it.</li>
    <li> For what I paid could of been a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Works great but they sent me the bottle open so a lot was wasted.</li>
    <li> Leaked out during shipping.... Got like a quarter of the bottle and pure acetone works just fine</li>
