      <li>Nice colors</li>
      <li>The girls really liked these at my daughter&#x27;s 10th birthday party.</li>
      <li>it is a good idea to bring two pairs just in case :)</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d rather wait for the people who make these slippers more sturdy so it doesn&#x27;t break that easily!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>Many of them did fall apart on the girls feet</li>
      <li>Most of the the client didn&#x27;t make it out the door before they broke.</li>
      <li>but I enjoyed them.  </li>
      <li>Cute, disposable.</li>
      <li>but they ripped easily.</li>
      <li>When we used this slippers it broke easily and we had to throw it away in the garbage.</li>
      <li>Good enough for the price, but some of them rip apart very easily.</li>
      <li>but for the most part the held up pretty well considering the cheap price!</li>
      <li>I offer free manicures and pedicures to my friends and family, so these seemed like an easy way to improve their &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; experience.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine,</li>
      <li>They will do the job, but they were cheap.  </li>
      <li>Glad to say she took the gift as a compliment and it has really helped her business!</li>
      <li>Super cheap items.  </li>
      <li>Worked perfect for the pedicures for my daughters 7 year old &amp;#34;spa party&amp;#34; they were big but served the purpose!</li>
      <li>So, the picture they show on the site does not give you a good enough look at them</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for any prolonged walking as the prongs break off pretty easily.</li>
      <li>They were shipped quickly and I would recommend the to anyone looking for this product.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and just as described/pictured.</li>
      <li>Durable and quick shipping.</li>
      <li>These shoes are much more cost-effective than flip-flops and we added a few stick-on jewels to each to make them more cute.  </li>
      <li>These are exactly as listed!  </li>
      <li>Very cost friendly.  </li>
      <li>Just right.</li>
      <li>Spend a little bit more and something with better quality.</li>
      <li>and this is exactly what I needed to get things off on the right foot.</li>
      <li>I received the item super fast</li>
      <li>Very unsatisfied!</li>
      <li>We buy these for our holistic healing center and they always hold up nicely.</li>
      <li>and I was hoping they would last more than 5 minutes, but</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>They would be very slippery!  </li>
      <li>Also shipped and delivered fast!</li>
      <li>Worth it for the cost though very flimsy.  </li>
      <li>I realize that these are very cheap, however, they do not hold up for too long.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;d be a good pick for kids.</li>
      <li>they are worth it at the price sold but not worthy of much more</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.  </li>
      <li>They give her the feeling of being at a real spa.</li>
      <li>Not made for walking too far but definitely worth it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>I ended up throwing more than half away.</li>
      <li>It shipped at a decent speed also.</li>
      <li>I pretty much don&#x27;t have any big complaints.</li>
      <li>Okay, so they are great pedicure slippers, made well, very thin, the usual.</li>
      <li>They are pretty durable, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>So overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a quick pair of disposables to last you a few hours, these should serve you fine.</li>
      <li>so I save the other one to use again as long as I have an even number of them I can get more than one use out of them even if I have to mix the colors.</li>
      <li>I used them for my 6 year old spa party, so they worked for the party.</li>
      <li>and it was exactly as described even sturdy enough to cut for smaller feet.</li>
      <li>Not sure if they will be useful, we are trying them out in the spa, they look pretty big.</li>
      <li>These should not be used near any moisture or slippery surfaces like marble floors or similar.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the package, the slippers were all together, however many of them were broken already.</li>
      <li>They are very thin, not even good enough for just waiting till you toenails are dry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect for my daughter&#x27;s beauty event!</li>
    <li> I realize that these are very cheap, however, they do not hold up for too long.  I think my toes are mostly dry before they rip.  Usually only one rips so I save the other one to use again as long as I have an even number of them I can get more than one use out of them even if I have to mix the colors.</li>
    <li> I offer free manicures and pedicures to my friends and family, so these seemed like an easy way to improve their &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; experience. They work great for that hour or two you might wait while waiting for the last of the lotion and polish to dry. I haven&#x27;t had any break, but I&#x27;ve also only used them with adults, who aren&#x27;t particularly rough on them. I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;d be a good pick for kids. However, they work great for me!</li>
    <li> So, the picture they show on the site does not give you a good enough look at them but I took the chance and ordered anyway because it was a good price. They just got here and though they are flat to the ground, they seem to be comfy and hold well on my feet. I will have to remember to come back with a followup review to let you guys know how long each individual pair lasts.  ...Hours later. Well folks it seems I spoke too soon but as promised, I&#x27;ve come back with a duration update. The pair that I took out to use, one has already a few hours later, come apart. Given the price and the fact that it&#x27;s a 12 pack for only $2.00 I pretty much don&#x27;t have any big complaints. I would have loved for it to have lasted longer, but it didn&#x27;t. So overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a quick pair of disposables to last you a few hours, these should serve you fine.</li>
    <li> perfect for a girls night party</li>
    <li> These flip flops very poorly made. Most of the the client didn&#x27;t make it out the door before they broke. Very unsatisfied!</li>
    <li> I just had my daughters 13th birthday. We had a spa party. The girls loved the slippers but they could not walk in them without them ripping on the sides.....a little disappointing.</li>
    <li> Good enough for the price, but some of them rip apart very easily. I had bought them thinking about offering for guests to wear for a few hours, but now I am re-tihinking it and will probably get another type.</li>
    <li> Cute, disposable. Not for XL feet though. Perfect for the pedi party I had.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased these for a friend of mine who had recently started a small spa business out of her house. She did great manis and pedis but never had flip flops for people to wear home. I gave her a set of these to get her started and help build her business. Glad to say she took the gift as a compliment and it has really helped her business!</li>
    <li> Very cute, colors are nice and bright - works temporarily.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for any prolonged walking as the prongs break off pretty easily.</li>
    <li> Not sure if they will be useful, we are trying them out in the spa, they look pretty big.</li>
    <li> Comfy product! Just like the ones in the salon.</li>
    <li> Okay, so they are great pedicure slippers, made well, very thin, the usual. But... I bought these to use at the gym as shower shoes because they were thin and light weight (wanted to save room in the bag).  These should not be used near any moisture or slippery surfaces like marble floors or similar.  They would be very slippery!  For pedicure use, they are great.</li>
    <li> The footcandy wasn&#x27;t that bad, but when it was my birthday, my friends and I were having a spa day at my house. When we used this slippers it broke easily and we had to throw it away in the garbage. This means that we are throwing our money in the garbage. These slippers are good, but I don&#x27;t recommend it, and if you want to buy it it&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;d rather wait for the people who make these slippers more sturdy so it doesn&#x27;t break that easily!</li>
    <li> These are exactly as listed!  We used them for my daughters spa party. Very cost friendly.  Shipped fast.  Just right.</li>
    <li> Great product! This was a hit at my daughter&#x27;s spa party. The girls loved these! Will definitely recommend to others. Also shipped and delivered fast!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. I am having a spa party for my daughters sleepover and this is exactly what I needed to get things off on the right foot.</li>
    <li> Super cheap items.  Not made for walking too far but definitely worth it.  Cant beat the price. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my home visitors (we do not wear shoes inside our home). It is really a bad quality and i am throwing it away. I can not even consider asking a visitor to try to wear this. This is poor quality all over. Do not recommend anyone to buy it. Spend a little bit more and something with better quality.</li>
    <li> great product, really happy I got it. It shipped at a decent speed also. I would recommend this to friends!</li>
    <li> These were great for the price. Used for a little girls spa party. A few pair broke but for the most part the held up pretty well considering the cheap price!</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughters spa birthday party, the price was great for 12 pairs.  I didn&#x27;t expect them to last forever, and knew they were just the foam slip ons but they ripped easily. I know these aren&#x27;t shoes and I was hoping they would last more than 5 minutes, but the girls didn&#x27;t care so it was alright.</li>
    <li> They are good pedicure shoes</li>
    <li> These are cute for a birthday spa party for my daughter!  I used paint to decorate the tops of the flip flop.  They loved it!  12 pairs, great price for a one time use!</li>
    <li> Worth it for the cost though very flimsy.  they are worth it at the price sold but not worthy of much more</li>
    <li> Terrible quality, take 2 steps and they break!!! Nice colors but it&#x27;s trash! They are very thin, not even good enough for just waiting till you toenails are dry</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted a spa party for her 10th birthday.  I went to Pinterest and found a ton of great ideas.  These shoes are much more cost-effective than flip-flops and we added a few stick-on jewels to each to make them more cute.  They arrived quickly and just as described/pictured.</li>
    <li> Bought my daughter a foot tub for Christmas.  I wanted her to have everything she needed for a great soak so I bought these slippers.  She loves them.  They give her the feeling of being at a real spa.</li>
    <li> Great for my daughter&#x27;s Spa Birthday.</li>
    <li> My daughter had a spa party at home. The moment the girl wore those they torn apart. They walked bare foot all night long. I threw all of them to the bin.</li>
    <li> The girls really liked these at my daughter&#x27;s 10th birthday party. They are a one use item but I didn&#x27;t mind. It gave the girls the feel of the spa. Many of them did fall apart on the girls feet but they were walking around in them. They are made it sit and wait for nails to dry. Would use them again.</li>
    <li> We buy these for our holistic healing center and they always hold up nicely.</li>
    <li> these slippers are great for the gym but the very first time I wore a pair they broke within three steps!  it is a good idea to bring two pairs just in case :)</li>
    <li> Color variety displayed on website was not the color selection I received. Was disappointing cause I purchased the items just because of the colors specifically.</li>
    <li> Worked perfect for the pedicures for my daughters 7 year old &amp;#34;spa party&amp;#34; they were big but served the purpose!</li>
    <li> I ordered these on the 29 of December. I received them within a week and they are as advertised. People are saying that they are poorly constructed....THEY ARE DISPOSABLE PEOPLE!!! They agree not meant to be worn like a shoe. They are pretty durable, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for a little girls Spa Party and received 6 pairs of yellow, 4 pairs of red and 2 pairs of purple. Not worth sending them back and not enough variety for the &amp;#34;Rainbow Spa&amp;#34; we are are creating for the party. I knew I may receive different colors, but at least thought they would be evenly distributed (I.e. 3 pairs of each color).</li>
    <li> These slippers are absolutely perfect for my spa, for clients who want to rest their feet.  I have a beach theme spa so they go well!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> There are a lot of great colors. A bit big for my clientele. Hopefully a smaller version will come out.</li>
    <li> I order these for my sister Lori&#x27;s Spa she is very happy with them she say&#x27;s they work great. They were shipped quickly and I would recommend the to anyone looking for this product.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package, the slippers were all together, however many of them were broken already. I ended up throwing more than half away.</li>
    <li> 2 pairs were discolored but they&#x27;re going on the feet and tossed so it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> good slippers for girly pedicures.</li>
    <li> i purchased these as favors for spa party gift baskets. they were perfect for the baskets, and the assortment was filled with colors that all of the women loved. for personal use, one pair could be used several times.</li>
    <li> These are very nice pedicure slippers. I bought them for a spa party we had for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and they went well with our theme and event!</li>
    <li> Used for my daughters spa party and it worked even though they were about three sizes to big. I have even used a pair myself. Durable and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Different colors allow some gender options, but still too small for some men&#x27;s feet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have these slippers to keep you feet off the floor after a pedicure and the colors are great.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughters birthday pampering party and these were great and inexpensive. perfect colors to put in their party bags.</li>
    <li> wish they were all one color but I enjoyed them.  all products went together perfectly</li>
    <li> They will do the job, but they were cheap.  A few pair came apart.  I used them for my 6 year old spa party, so they worked for the party.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and expected.</li>
    <li> I needed this item in a hurry for a little girl spa birthday. I received the item super fast and it was exactly as described even sturdy enough to cut for smaller feet.</li>
