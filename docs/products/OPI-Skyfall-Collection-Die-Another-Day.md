    <li> I fell in love with the deep red of this nail polish as shown in the picture. However, when i received this nail polish i found it to be somewhat streaky and rather close to an orange hue. Prlly wouldnt buy again :/</li>
    <li> Nice polish. It&#x27;s very bright. You almost can never find a kind like this one. I will recommend this item for anybody.</li>
    <li> its a favorite color and the packaging was perfect. no damages and absolutely love the color and texture is not lumpy.</li>
    <li> I love this color! Once I saw it I could not take my eyes&lt;br /&gt;of of it and had to have it.  It is a high quality polish with&lt;br /&gt;great staying power.</li>
    <li> It shipped quick and I love the color. Price was also a great deal. Will use it all the time!</li>

    <li> Nails were done in the salon with this color during the 2012 holidays.  The polish did not clip for over 3 weeks.  I was so pleased with the color that I search locally but could not find it.  So, I went to the internet to purchase.  I have worn OPI polish for over 15 years.  This is a brillant/glossy combination of orange and red  -  Great Color....</li>
