<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great, cheap, but didn&#x27;t come in a box, but that&#x27;s fine, can&#x27;t really ask for a good scent, that&#x27;s also cheap to come with everything you thought you were going to get.</li>
    <li> Some girls around me say they like the smell. I like it too. Low price and best product you can get. I would keep using it.</li>
    <li> I recieved many compliments when I wore this cologne, so I decided to buy another bottle and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Deep Enegry is a just a great smelling cologne that women appreciate. It literary stops women in their tracks just for them to say how good it smells.</li>
    <li> If you are a frequent perfume user...Buy it.&lt;br /&gt;you can spray as much as you like at this price&lt;br /&gt;I can say, this product is really worth the Bill</li>
    <li> We bought this one year as a birthday gift for my daughter&#x27;s friend.  After the girls sniffing him for a year they all requested that we buy it for him again.  We haven&#x27;t tried any other Adidas scents yet, but this one&#x27;s a winner.  I know you&#x27;re tired of me saying it, but with Amazon Prime this is a great deal.  We couldn&#x27;t find this locally and Prime got it here on time during the Christmas rush.  A round of thumbs up from us!</li>
    <li> Well I sorta like this spray but not really, i got USHER UR and it is alot better than this, adidas is cheap for a reason cheap cologne for a cheap smell, its smells clean, sorta soapy like you just took a shower. not bad, but ive had better :P</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the positive reviews.  When I first spray it on my skin it gives off a semi-sweet, intriguing scent.  As it dries, the sweet notes turn spicy and matures into a more masculine, nighttime scent.  Then the spiciness settles after about 30 minutes.  This is more masculine than I was looking for, but for the super low price, the quality definitely outweighs the price.  If you are a reluctant buyer, for probably the same reasons as me, then don&#x27;t hesitate in pulling the trigger.  There is no &amp;#34;cheapness&amp;#34; in this scent, and smells better than colognes I&#x27;ve bought in the $20-$40 range.  Very good cologne!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne for my significant other after he read the reviews about it. This cologne smells AMAZING &amp; sultry! I love when my fiance wears it. He has several Ralph Lauren Polo colognes, and I prefer this one. The only reason I give it four stars is because the scent does not last long...unfortunatey.</li>
    <li> hmmm recieved with broken case,.. i was goin to give for christmas gift but now im goona use it,.. hmm</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present and it arrived before Christmas, in good condition.  I was very pleased with the service and the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance as one of the gifts for my husband&#x27;s birthday. He loves it. It has an intoxicating scent. I found myself sniffing my husband. The fragrance last long, which was important because my husband is extremely active. I recommend that you purchase this colonge, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is an okay scent but if you are looking for longevity from it, then this is not the one for you! I bought this for my son who is 10yrs and he likes it!</li>
    <li> being a first time buyer from this company, i was skeptical about this product/seller because the price was so great and low but then the product was delivered the next day in excellent shape. i highly recommend this company for everyone.</li>
    <li> I am one of those guys who hates it when cologene&#x27;s have a sweet scent to them. Honestly they give me a headache. So when I was in highschool a friend bought me some addidas moves cologene. I loved it! I started using addidas then and have never looked back! A few years ago when they did the deep energy scent I tried that and found adidas had done themselves one better. It is, in my opinion, the best cologene out there as well as very affordable. I have even tried some of the more expensive cologenes and don&#x27;t like them as much. If you like non-sweet, non-fruity, and just all around good smelling cologene, get this.[[ASIN:B001FWXI6U Adidas Deep Energy by Adidas For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4-Ounces]]</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the cologne.  It smelled crisp and fresh.  The package arrived on time and actually ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> excellent and very good</li>
    <li> A little stronger than I like, but my son made me smell it 2 seconds after he put it on. I think it will be better once it has been on a little longer. I bought this one and the Team Force, which we like better. I will give it a chance, but prefer the Team Force on first assessment..</li>
    <li> Smells great! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne. Yes, technically \\&quot;eau de toilette\\&quot;, but we both really like it. He&#x27;s been wearing it for the better part of three years.</li>
    <li> Smells good and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments while using this. Gave this to my little brother as a gift and he loved it. Totes recommend.</li>
    <li> I have many colognes from Aqua di Gio, Hugo Boss, Lacoste, Mustang, Perry Ellis, Ralph Lauren, Versace etc... for around $11 you can get this nice scent from adidas... Out of all of the colognes i have i absolutely love this one.. I dont rank it as THE best in my collection but its pretty far up on the list. if you want it to last your gonna have to spray it on your clothes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe the scent as smooth, subtle, sweet, sporty, and last but not least... Manly</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son, he loves the smell...</li>
    <li> Bought based on price and the reviews. Im not much of a cologne wearing guy but thought id try one out so i went with something not economically risky. Reminds me of a mix between Adidas Moves and some kind of Axe smell. I definitely would not expect to impress any women with this. Smells cheap and for Jr. High kids. I guess Ill go with a top brand and more expensive one next time. For the price, I guess Ill wear it to work...</li>
    <li> I will keep this fast and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, it stays on for all day, and gets you lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. My female friends love it. The only complaint i have about it is that after 7 hours or so you may need to reapply some, but that is to be expected. The scent is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> nice smell...it&#x27;s not very hard and not even so light either...i liked it for the reason it smells gud and stays long...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 14 and bought this thinking it was just some cheap cologne a step up from axe and bod. Well not exactly. The smell goes away so fast (Thank goodness) and it smells equal to or worse then axe. To be honest, it really just smells like expired cologne if you&#x27;ve ever smelt that. It does come in a pretty good size bottle. But man, it does not work well with the ladies.</li>
    <li> very good. excellent.</li>
    <li> It reminds me of CK One but a little muskier. All-purpose, classy, very high quality scent. My favorite so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this cologne was a high school stereotype, it would be athletic prep, all the way. This would be slam dunk gift for anyone in school or college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the strength. I bought mine two weeks ago and I&#x27;m already a quarter of the way through the bottle. And I&#x27;m not the type to shower in cologne. (ok, maybe a little :)</li>
    <li> It smells good, but dose not last long,or not very strong, like other perfumes I have been using. and i&#x27;m writing this sentence because they didn&#x27;t let me post only the first sentence,cause they said it&#x27;s short. I hope this is long enough for them now.</li>
    <li> I have owned Polo, Aqua Di Gio (which is now so popular there is really no reason at all to wear it unless you want to smell like every man) Diesel, and Abercrombie colognes, but I still prefer this cologne. My ex-girlfriend bought me this last Christmas. Women rave about it much more than they have with any of the aforementioned colognes. I am constantly getting compliments from women. I even like to smell it on my self as I go throughout the day. Sounds dumb but woman seem more affectionate when I wear it too. Cannot recommend enough. It might wear out after 8 hours or so. I just carry it in my car and I give an extra spray. Occasionally I try to go back to more expensive colognes, but I always come back to this its just solid.</li>
    <li> I mainly buy Adidas for work.  I smell better with it than without.  My wife seems to like this one as well.  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the scents that Adidas provides.  Will continue to buy unless a better deal comes along.</li>
    <li> I was in the market to look for a very cheap cologne that I would use as basically a body spray when I&#x27;m out of the showers. It doesn&#x27;t have to be anything fancy but it did have to be cheap and fairly good smelling. After some digging around, I choose Adidas Deep Energy. For such a cheap price, you are getting a fairly big bottle. As for the smell, I have to say that this is just your average cologne. It&#x27;s really hard to describe the smell. It&#x27;s just really, really basic. Totally nothing remarkable about it. As for its lasting appeal, it&#x27;s not that good as well. A few moments after you spray it on, you&#x27;ll hardly know it&#x27;s there other than random times when you get a small whiff of it.&lt;br /&gt;Again, for such a cheap price, I can afford to spray 4-5 sprays every time and not have to worry about it running out. I also bought this without high expectations since the price was so low. Although I don&#x27;t have a problem with the generic \\&quot;your run of the mill\\&quot; cheap cologne smell, I am very disappointed in its longevity.</li>
    <li> For this cheap of a bottle, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Nice sporty scent, kinda citrusy I guess, I&#x27;m not really good at classifying smells of cologne, but it smells good. It&#x27;s Adidas so.&lt;br /&gt;It is not that strong, you&#x27;re probably wanna do 3 sprays minimum. But it does last all day, though it gets weak throughout the day. But I like it.</li>
    <li> the cologne lasts a good while and smells very clean a and crisp.  people notice the cologne and complement on how good i smell.  i have already bought a second bottle for when i run out.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift and was very happy with company&#x27;s response/delivery time.  Good price.  My faith in ordering online is intact.</li>
    <li> It is strong while applying and smells too hard, but after few minutes it came to normal. Overall it doesn&#x27;t fit as par brand expectation. It is a low cost can say good value for money, it would be good for someone just want to put before gym.</li>
    <li> Like it says in my title, it is a fragrance booster. Honestly, not sure if its a fancy way of saying cologne or something but yeah. It has a good scent. To me it has a hint of a mandarin scent mixed with like a itsy bitsy hint of wood musk. To the person that applies it, after a while the scent may go away, but this is because your nose has gotten used to the scent so the nose doesn&#x27;t really focus on it.To reset your nose, take a whiff of some coffee beans that aren&#x27;t grounded. Your nose has now been \\&quot;reset\\&quot; :)  All in all it last about a good 8 hours for a heavy sweater like me.</li>
    <li> I got this for my brother.&lt;br /&gt;He loves most of the Adidas Fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is too good, and very good deal with respect to price.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need to say much because it Adidas. Am pleased  with the results any time i have this perfume on me.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne if you&#x27;re into woody scents.  It&#x27;s a bit generic to some extent, but at the same time, I haven&#x27;t smelled many colognes like this.  Best places to spray are your pulse points.  For me, one spray is enough for me.  Two tends to get too strong for those around me (I&#x27;m generally around Asian people so maybe their sense of smell is a bit sensitive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silage is pretty good.  If you pass by someone, they&#x27;re likely to get a scent of you.  It&#x27;s even more so if they get intimate with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity could use some work.  I find that I&#x27;ll have to reapply about 4 hours in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle&#x27;s atomizer isn&#x27;t the best.  Most starting sprays begin in sprits.  I find that I have to spray a few times into the air to get the atomizer working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make a scent last a bit longer, try spraying on your chest a bit above the sternum.  It won&#x27;t project very far, but the scent will more likely last longer.  Or try moisturizing your app points 10 minutes before applying the cologne.  It&#x27;ll weaken the scent strength but lengthen the longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been nearly 2 years and I still had half a bottle left.  Lost it a few months ago so will need to pick up another one.</li>
    <li> adidas best scent, not saying much since most are garbage but can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Every girl that ive met loves this smell. it has a very pleasant aroma, it is a solid investment for any single guy.</li>
    <li> This spray smells good. It&#x27;s not too strong or weak. Which is just what i wanted. I didn&#x27;t want people to be able to smell me from across the room, this one seems to do it right. The glass bottle is a nice shape and looks just like the picture (aside from the liquid being clear and not orange, but who cares really). All in all it&#x27;s well worth the money. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see if it really does have the effect on women that some people on here claim but i&#x27;ll comeback and add something if it isn&#x27;t true.

    <li> The Adidas Deep Energy line smells amazing!  This is a great value for the size.  Much more expensive at other facilities for the same product.</li>
    <li> I constantly get compliments on this extremely inexpensive cologne. Could not recommend it more. Good athletic manly smell, very tasteful.</li>
    <li> Wanted a cheap clone to use here and there when I needed it, these were great when they were like $5, now at this price they don&#x27;t make no sense.</li>
    <li> Not very strong, does&#x27; nt last long. Not very impressed by it.</li>
    <li> well, back to giving cologne..somehow I just don&#x27;t know what styles youngsters like (he&#x27;s 44). thank heavens I got him cologne.</li>
    <li> I bought these to give away to some relatives in my foreign country. these are very cheap and has fairly good smell.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple of these after reading the reviews but once the products arrived I realized that I have thrown away my money on such a cheap product. The scent doesn&#x27;t last even for a couple of minutes and there is no way the person standing next to you can smell it. It&#x27;s just water with a bit of scent as other reviewer said. I wish I could rate a negative star for this piece of crap! Don&#x27;t ever buy this from Amazon. You can get better ones for a cheaper price elsewhere.</li>
    <li> my husvand like this..smail realy goog</li>
    <li> Very fresh scent. Good for summer days. Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of all the Adidas colognes!  It smells great and it&#x27;s not overpowering.  You can use quite a bit without it being obnoxious!</li>
    <li> Not bad for this price I&#x27;d say.</li>
    <li> Good choice if you want something not so expensive for daily use.. The smell is strong and last 6hours easily..</li>
    <li> Love this scent! Clean and citrusy and lasts fairly long.  It&#x27;s a strong scent that requires very little to have an effect.  Radiates within a pretty large area, I always have people asking me what it is when they walk by my cubicle.  At only $8 a bottle it&#x27;s the bargain of the century!</li>
    <li> Excelente calidad precio - producto. El olor no es ni muy fuerte ni muy suave, pero si muy varonil</li>
    <li> No fragrance&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY&lt;br /&gt;There is literally NO fragrance</li>
    <li> Excellent as always, fine products great prices, prompt an courteus service all the way</li>
    <li> This adidas product is a very good purchase. The smell is nice and my girl really like it when I wear it on my clothes.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like about an inexpensive bottle of EDT spray with a surprisingly good scent. Should be a repeat buy. Shipping was excellent too.</li>
    <li> Well i went to WalMart and this was the only cologne I could afford at the moment and i needed some bad. It smells great and keeps the ladies on you all day! I get some that grab a hold of me telling me I smell so good. &#x3D;D But anyway, buy it on Amazon. it&#x27;s MUCH CHEAPER than at stores. (like most products)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid about $16 for it at WalMart, but will definitely buy it online when I run out. as it is only around $10-$12</li>
    <li> Apparently a teen is not dressed until cologne is applied  so we go through a lot. He is picky about  colognes and this one smells good and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> normal for simple occasions perfume is not much but for the price really worth it, of course the aroma goes fast but for the price I do like&lt;br /&gt;Perfume is as is as described and delivery was stipulated</li>
    <li> Actually a decent one for Adidas,  unlike the other ones</li>
    <li> well i just bought it yesterday and i went on a date with it on todayy....lets just say she loved itt :)</li>
    <li> Item was as described and deliver on time as expected.</li>
    <li> Awesome smell for casual use.</li>
    <li> The price is great, smell good but it only lasts for one hour and you feel like you may forgot to spray it on.</li>
    <li> This spray is okay. I personally think it was made to mixed in with sweat to smell good. I you wear it to a party you won&#x27;t get too many compliments...But if you work out you&#x27;re golden</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume because of the price and being adidas. I got it and I didn&#x27;t know if it would smell good. For my surprise, it smells really good. Very mainly. I like it. This is a secret santa gift, I hope the receipient likes it too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t count Adidas cologne&#x27;s out.  This by far is my favorite cologne from their line.  I use Deep Energy year round.  Its sweet and strong!  To me it has the smell of, &amp;#34;I am in charge, yet a really nice guy&amp;#34;, if that makes sense!  It lasts all day and particularly shines when I warm up.  When I start to get warmer than normal I can really smell it.  I&#x27;ve never had to refresh mid-day.  This ranks in my top 3 despite costing 10x less!</li>
    <li> A good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Blind bought after reading all the stella reviews.OK for $7.99 @ T-JMAX. Kinda sweet and stays very close to the skin even after 8 spays. Not bad for a cheapy. I will not be getting this again.</li>
    <li> great deal and very nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I used this mainly for after the gym and I didn&#x27;t find it overpowering.  Its definitely more of a daytime fragrance.</li>
    <li> The perfume box was not wrapped in plastic . And the box looked like it was opened . So i asked replacement . Even the replacement has also arrived as the first one . I think the perfume is not the original . It does not even smell like the  original adidas .</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this scent and was disappointed. Not only is the scent rather weak, it is also rather \\&quot;generic,\\&quot; for want of a a more precise term. It smells as though it belongs in the catalog of one of those knock-off \\&quot;match\\&quot; brands. I am not saying it smells bad, but it just seems to have no real redeeming virtue other than not smelling bad. That&#x27;s not exactly a reason to buy it, though. I can&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great daily spray for me, I have gotten a lot of compliments on it. One thing that surprised me was it doesn&#x27;t smell good after working out. It actually makes me smell worse. I know everyone is different when it comes to cologne but it&#x27;s good thing to know before buying.</li>
    <li> I like this smell but it does not last long... but that should be expected based upon the price. Better deal on here than in a store though, paid less than the price of a 1.7 fl oz to get the 3.4 fl oz.</li>
    <li> It smells horrible. After reading all the reviews, I thought I would give it a try. Once I sprayed it, it gave me a headache and the smell was horrible. I will not buy any Adidas cologne in the future. I ended up giving this to my little 8 year old brother because he liked it a little.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy. I like adidas anyhow. But this stuff smells pretty good. But the value is in the size. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Really nice perfume with great smell. You feel refresh with an ethereal like fragrance. Girls will really love it. Nice to wear this also when you workout in the gym.</li>
    <li> Doesnt smell nice. Spend some money and get a real thing... It just doesnt smell right at all.. Cheap stuff</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Adidas has produced. Smells great.</li>
    <li> It smells great, and it lasts for a decent amount of time. I have recieved good compliments while wearing it, and i suggest that the scent be used at night. This is my favorite out of all the adidas fragrances that i have tried. The only problem that ive come across is that when spraying it on the cap likes to drip a little bit. Overall i am very happy with the purchase and you can&#x27;t argue with the price!</li>
    <li> this product have a good smelling and good fragrance, the price is like buy at candy. Recommended this product is because look like an original perfume selling at department store like Macy Bloomingdale, target...</li>
    <li> As the one i bought in my local store.  For some reason this one smells more like rubbing alcahol than anyting else.  The one i bought at the store had more of the fresh scenet, so i&#x27;m pretty dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Very Good Product, Smell is better than I thought. The product is packaged perfectly and it is more appealing when its in your hand.</li>
    <li> Love it! Very nice product for the price! I use it everyday. I live in Venezuela the place where Eau De Toilette are so expensive, so 8 dollars for this it is kinda ridiculous!</li>
    <li> its as described online and I recommend to all online to purchase! I love it and bought to my cousin!</li>
    <li> Think original Adidas cologne but a little more pungent and manly. I recently went on a cologne online shopping spree and purchased quite a bunch of different brands. THIS is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s downright impossible to rate a cologne online as everybody has different tastes, if you like the original: you will LOVE this scent. Also, recommend claiborn sport and tommy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just that.  The smell will last a while, but have to be really close to be able to tell (just the way I like my cologne to be).  The smell it self is very bland and nothing special.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. Good quality. And for people who need it, I recommend it 100%. In addition, this a good price.</li>
    <li> very good. nice scent. long lasting. fast delivery. thank you.</li>
    <li> Original scent but weaker than expected.</li>
    <li> Its got that boy smell to it. If you&#x27;re out of highschool I would not really recommened it. Seems to not last that long either.</li>
    <li> Normal scented. Not too strong.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and you want to snuggle up to your man while he&#x27;s wearing it. Other products cost a fortune! Save money and be happy at the same time. He loves it, I love it, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I currently wear this stuff. I really love the smell. It&#x27;s got that young guy kinda smell to it. Anyways, I give it 4 stars because while the smell is great and not overpowering at all, it does seem to wear off pretty quickly. Usually within an hour or so. Either that or my nose just gets used to it. But even when I&#x27;m not doing anything particularly active, the scent seems to die off quickly. Wish it stuck around longer...</li>
    <li> I felt a little dizzy when I opened and sprayed it on my clothes the first time and no return allowed.....</li>
    <li> This is the kind of eau de toilette that people make faces or start waving their hands at when they smell it on you. Simply smells like strong musk from beginning to end. Very similar scent to some Old Spice products.</li>
    <li> fast delivery and great cologne for someone who&#x27;s not committed and still finding the perfect scent.</li>
    <li> I was all excited after reading the reviews. I wish I knew what the rave is about this cologne. Its a very weak sent. I am wondering if I got a bad batch. Im not too impressed.</li>
    <li> Smells are subjective things.  That said, good lord this stuff is horrible.  A bit too musky and apparently \\&quot;Top notes of bergamot and mandarin\\&quot; translates to \\&quot;will give you a headache that lasts all day\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Pawned it off to the girlfriend&#x27;s little brother.  He likes it, so I&#x27;ll add a star for that.</li>
    <li> Great product and price, shipping and service was perfect! I think it has a good scent and there are a lot of reviews to support that. For the price you have nothing to lose here!</li>
    <li> the smell is so nice and last longer. its a cool and nice  spray for cool guys..love my adidas perf</li>
    <li> i like the smell. But i think it would only last about couple hours before it disapears. I would buy this again1</li>
    <li> Not too overpowering, manly but not &amp;#34;old manish&amp;#34;.  Very sexy.  He always gets extra attention when he wears it ;-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. He likes to wear his fathers so I bought some of his own. He liked it a lot. It smells very manly and clean.</li>
    <li> One of if not the best edt&#x27;s for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top ten edt&#x27;s in my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting and amazing scent.</li>
    <li> I bought the Adidas spray to use when I am wearing my sports attire. It has a great swell that is not to dominating or that would be associated with what I might use if I were wearing a suit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why. But to me it smells like a cheap orange soda. I will not be buying this again. I think when it comes to adidas colognes. I&#x27;ll stick with a adidas moves.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE LOVE IT SO MUCH IT LAST LONG AND WAS A GREAT PRICE! I LOVE THIS SELLER  AND IT ARRIVED ON TIME!!</li>
    <li> It was good, it sprayed, and the box was in good shape. I would definitely recommend this product for the amount it costs.</li>
    <li> Purchased in 2011. Very poor cologne spray. Scent lasted for only a few minutes. I would not give this cologne to anyone, even my enemies. Won&#x27;t purchase again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent scent, but doesn&#x27;t last a very long time. Nine more words required... and almost nearly done. There</li>
    <li> How did this cologne get such good reviews, it&#x27;s a complete mystery to me. The worst cologne I ever purchased. I t barely has a scent that disappears almost immediately after you put it on. How could Addidas brand such an inferior product? Do not waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Adidas Deep Energy by Adidas For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4-Ounces is a great buy and smells great as well!!!</li>
    <li> This is my teenage son&#x27;s favorite cologne. I have a hard time finding it in the stores here. Great price and excellent delivery! Will make a great Christmas present.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and it smells amazing!! its such a good price and smell, im hoping he never asks for another !!</li>
    <li> This cologne smells like sugar mixed with alcohol. It made me dizzy after 30 mins. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Bought this because i wanted to stay on a budget. If you want something that will last for 30 mins and then disappear until you sweat to reactivate the smell, then get this haha.</li>
    <li> This is a simple Addidas cologne but is a money maker of smells. It looks small but really its a lot</li>
    <li> this has arrived FAST and smells really good, packaging is OK. however the bottle doesn&#x27;t look the same, it looks taller with curved sides.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lasts long enough. I don&#x27;t usually like wearing cologne but this is a good fragrance. I usually only use a spritz or 2 and that&#x27;s good for the next few hours.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to buy this after reading so many comments about how the scent didn&#x27;t last long but I bought it anyway and it was a great choice. This cologne smells amazing for how inexpensive it is and it actually does last. The scent does wear off after a few hours but after you sweat a little bit, the scent comes right back. I would definitely recommend this to any teen who is active in a sport and stinks alot.</li>
    <li> good staff, reasonable price, smells nice&lt;br /&gt;action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it.</li>
    <li> I really like Adidas perfumes. You get what you pay for, you will not get any better for this price. The only down side of this perfume is lack of scent after 2-3 hours</li>
    <li> the smell of the product is spectacular, it looks better in person, the package design is in accordance with the lotion, I am very happy with this fragrance. This lotion recomiento 100% and look forward to buying him the vendor. in shipping was on time</li>
    <li> This has a totally fresh, clean smell.  All the girls I know like it when I wear it.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
    <li> the smell is great but the time until it wears off is only about a hour or two. Adidas is slacking off some on this as it should last much longer at least some of the scent.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, fine daily cologne. COTY/ ADIDAS makes about ten of this item, in different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34; I use most of them.&lt;br /&gt;All are LESS THAN $10/ bottle.</li>
    <li> Another favorite of mine. My hubby smells so amazing when he wears this stuff. I like to sniff him as he walks by lol</li>
    <li> Wow I was surprised when I smelled for the first time. It&#x27;d amazing!  I&#x27;m strongly recommended. A cheap and cool one</li>
    <li> Not a good perfumes to buy. Smells only for few seconds then losts. I get better perfume in dollar shop</li>
    <li> smells fantastic and last long.</li>
    <li> Nice sporty fresh smell. I tend to wear this when I am being more active. Not as strong as I thought it would be but not nessisarily in a bad way.</li>
    <li> me encanta esta fragancia es tan especial, a todas mis hermanas y cu&amp;ntilde;adas les gusto es especial para el hombre elegante, especial para mi esposo.</li>
    <li> Very very good I suggest to buy if you want the ladies</li>
    <li> Great scent for a guy, not too overbearing. I was surprised by all the good reviews and totally shocked when I received it and  tried it for myself. If only all good scents were so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, I&#x27;m always using it at work. It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so good, I keep using this brand and scent</li>
    <li> WAS ONLY PLACE I FOUND IT AT A DECENT PRICE ALSO WAS SHIPPED WHEN PROMISED AND RECEIVED EARLY SO MADE IT FOR CHRISTMAS DAY</li>
    <li> it came on time and intact, it smells good but it doesnt last more than an hour, i ended up using it for car freshener...save your money</li>
    <li> Smells nice and lasts a good while. Would and will buy this item again once i run out. I would also like to try the body wash. Think i will make that my next order.</li>
    <li> I have a husband that likes to play basketball during his break at work as well as after work , so he sprays this sport spray on everyday and I don&#x27;t smell a stinky sweaty man when he comes home.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong either .  good stuff !!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to have for everyday, lounging around doing nothing use! Cool and crisp scent, I&#x27;ve recieved a few compliments on it so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> good for the price. nice scent</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son for a Christams gift. Fortunately its for my son as he will not care that the packaging was destroyed when I opened the shipping box. The bottle was ok, not broken or  chipped, not leaking.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend of the family and I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;s going to love it. If not, he can give it back to me and I&#x27;ll let my husband wear it because it smells YUMMY!</li>
    <li> Seemed &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;.  Do not purchase.  Not a quality item.  Somebody is working a scam here!  Do not purchase this item!!</li>
    <li> As an adult, it&#x27;s OK.  Jr High/High School aged son loves it.  I would give it 3 stars if it weren&#x27;t for my son.  I don&#x27;t really care for it so I gave it to him and it&#x27;s a big success.  Maybe good gift for younger crowd.</li>
    <li> In past I used 2 different Body Sprays from Adidas and I really liked it and so with this I ordered 5 diff body sprays and 4 different &amp;#34; Eau De Toilette &amp;#34; Spray&#x27;s as well.I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Worth the price. Smells like the armani brand. Go for it. Doesnt have a prastic wrap though like most of the perfumes.</li>
    <li> This is the first fragrance I buy for myself, and I like it. It is with good price and smells good. Not too strong, but strong enough for me. Recommended for men who just start to try fragrance.</li>
    <li> buenos d&amp;iacute;as gracias por el producto estoy muy satisfecho,la entrega fue rapida como estaba indicada en la compra bay hasta luego</li>
    <li> This smells sooo good on my husband! I was hesitant to buy such a cheap price cologne.... But glad I did! Amazing, sexy scent and lasts a good while!!</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance..  Only issue with this is that it&#x27;s not long lasting..</li>
    <li> nephew wanted this for his first ever toiletter glad he asked for it and you had it for hime thanks</li>
    <li> It works for me my girl loves it its not for every man</li>
    <li> Too strong initially when sprayed, but then rapidly fades out in about 3 hours</li>
    <li> this perfume is very good, not only price is not expensive, but also smell is scented.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> It was everything and more</li>
    <li> This smells great and last for a long time (longer than Adidas Moves or Moves 0:01). It has a pretty thick spray compared to other smaller 1.7 colognes.</li>
    <li> Adidas Deep Energy by Adidas For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4-Ounces&lt;br /&gt;Adidas Deep Energy by Adidas For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4-Ounces&lt;br /&gt;Adidas Deep Energy by Adidas For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4-Ounces</li>
