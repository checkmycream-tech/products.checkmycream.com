      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>Wish it had more oils.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff when you&#x27;re at the Marriott and they have it in your room.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m picky about lotions, and I love this one.</li>
      <li>We used this product while staying at a hotel and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>Try it, you will love it.</li>
      <li>I first tried this at a Courtyard Hotel, and loved it then and ordered it on line immediately afterward.</li>
      <li>The light lemony fragrance it so lovely and with a very very light scent of sage</li>
      <li>This lotion was perfect- a light airy feel, but my face felt deeply moisturized.</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth as silk and the scent is very, very light.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much</li>
      <li>Lovely, light scent and absorbent but rich cream.  </li>
      <li>It is luxurious like silk on my skin and absorbs quickly not to mention smells relaxingly great!.</li>
      <li>It absorbes into the skin quickly and is not oily or greasy at all!  </li>
      <li>I rarely love a body product at first try!</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin smooth and not greasy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and stays with you during the day.</li>
      <li>Quality and lightly scented.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs well and leaves your skin feeling smooth.  </li>
      <li>It glides on smoothly, has a bright citrus aroma, and keeps my hands moist for a long time (until I use soap to wash it).</li>
      <li>I love the Paul Mitchell Lemon Sage Body lotion, but this product was either a knock off, or old.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s worth it to spoil yourself from time to time.  </li>
      <li>, my husband loves this product and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>It has a clean, fresh (not heavy) scent.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hard to find and smells great.</li>
      <li>Pretty expensive, but a great lotion!</li>
      <li>I am very scent sensitive - I get migraines easily with certain smells - and this product actually makes my head feel better.</li>
      <li>While this absorbs quickly, and moisturizes well, I&#x27;m guessing that it&#x27;s pretty old.</li>
      <li>I love this for the dry, winter months, when it seems like your hands will never be wrinkle-free again.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it absorbs not leaving my skin feeling oily, but soon my skin turns dry again.</li>
      <li>for some reason it didn&#x27;t smell or feel the same as the lotion in the little bottles, but delivery was quick and in good condition.</li>
      <li>so consider this a very momentary spa experience.</li>
      <li>Works fast, soaks into your skin with no residue.  </li>
      <li>I really like this lotion.  </li>
      <li>I really like the&lt;br /&gt;smell of this cream and the way it makes my skin</li>
      <li>You can use this all over and not worry too much about smelling like a lemon cookie.</li>
      <li>Although this is hard to find, I love the clean and calming smell of this lotion.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a fresh smell.</li>
      <li>This is either a knock off, or a very old product.</li>
      <li>While I didn&#x27;t notice any energizing effects I did notice how soft my skin was minutes after I used</li>
      <li>This is thick enough to work nicely as a hand cream.</li>
      <li>I also live in a warm climate, so I don&#x27;t like really thick lotions that feel heavy on my skin when it&#x27;s hot.</li>
      <li>My whole family uses it for dry hands and elbows.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and am usually annoyed by most smells.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Item was listed as new so not sure why there was no safety seal and was instead taped shut with masking tape.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff when you&#x27;re at the Marriott and they have it in your room. So I bought a larger bottle for home.  LOVE  the smell, but the value isn&#x27;t great for the price and size of bottle.</li>
    <li> this lotion is great it releive inching very fast my wife uses it also George</li>
    <li> This is the best, longest lasting lotion I have found.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer.  Wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell, nice light glide, my husband loves this product and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing lotion I have ever used.I found it as a sample at a hotel we stayed at, searched until I found it on Amazon and now I hide the tube so it lasts me longer.Amazing lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, lemony and natural.  I&#x27;m picky about lotions, and I love this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey.  But it&#x27;s worth it to spoil yourself from time to time.  Love the lemon smell, it&#x27;s non-greasy and soaks in wonderfully</li>
    <li> Quality and lightly scented.  I first tried this at a Courtyard Hotel, and loved it then and ordered it on line immediately afterward.</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Lemon Sage Body Lotion does not have the scent of sage in it at all. It does however have a very pleasant lemon zest scent that makes you feel happy when you inhale it. The lotion is not strong enough to produce this response unless you rub it on your hands and then place your hands near your nose and inhale. Then it can work its magic. You can use this all over and not worry too much about smelling like a lemon cookie. The scent only lasts a few minutes so consider this a very momentary spa experience. This is thick enough to work nicely as a hand cream. While I didn&#x27;t notice any energizing effects I did notice how soft my skin was minutes after I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> this is the stuff they give out at marriott couryards...my daughter is in love with it.  it&#x27;s hard to find and smells great.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion from a friend whose daughter is going to school at Paul Mitchell.  The 6.8 oz. tube of this fabulous lotion was $13.98!  When I told her I saw it on Amazon at twice the price, she was thankful I didn&#x27;t buy it.  I am too!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after trying a sample at a hotel I was staying in. The lotion is considerably more &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;. It glides on smoothly, has a bright citrus aroma, and keeps my hands moist for a long time (until I use soap to wash it). I love this for the dry, winter months, when it seems like your hands will never be wrinkle-free again. Like some other reviewers have stated, I don&#x27;t smell the sage in it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing.  It is quite expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Pretty expensive, but a great lotion!</li>
    <li> Have the hotel sample in my hands. the product feels great and smells great. nothing to complain about here. Try it, you will love it.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  the smell last a very long time, which is relaxing and soothing of the skin.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product.  It has a wonderful light lemon scent.  I keep it here at my desk &amp; use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and am usually annoyed by most smells. I was impressed when I used a sample size of this lotion at a hotel and wanted more. I love this and use it on my body daily-the scent is light, refreshing, and the formula doesn&#x27;t bother my skin! I wish this was easier to find and cheaper because I&#x27;m weighing my options in my tight budget to decide if I should buy it again. This works well as a pick me up during the day when applied to the hands and it moisturizes my dry legs post shaving. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger long though, which can be a good or bad thing depending on your preferences.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion.  I use it every day, and my skin has improved!  It is very expensive, so I use it sparingly.  In spite of the expense I do use it, but not as much as I would if it were not so expensive!  Price has come up, so maybe it will go back down...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, I thank you.</li>
    <li> While this absorbs quickly, and moisturizes well, I&#x27;m guessing that it&#x27;s pretty old. It feels the same on my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same. It smells....old? The product doesn&#x27;t look the same as what I&#x27;ve tried in salons either. This is either a knock off, or a very old product.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!!  It is so clean smelling and pleasant!  Great for the skin too!!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this. It&#x27;s light and stays with you during the day.</li>
    <li> I got several sample bottles of this wonderful body lotion while staying at a very nice hotel in Columbus, Ohio! I loved it the minute I tried it! The light lemony fragrance it so lovely and with a very very light scent of sage make the combination just perfect!  If it were to be stronger of sage, I think I would smell like the stuffing in the Thanksgiving Turkey!!! Thankfully it has the perfect balance of the both! It absorbes into the skin quickly and is not oily or greasy at all!  I rarely love a body product at first try! I am extremely picky about all body lotions and creams plus I am scent sensitive because I get migrain headaches so it&#x27;s another plus that I can tolerate the scent so well!!!  As soon as my sample is gone I will be purchasing more of this beautiful lotion!  It&#x27;s that fantastic!!! Try it and you just may love it too!</li>
    <li> for some reason it didn&#x27;t smell or feel the same as the lotion in the little bottles, but delivery was quick and in good condition. no leakage, etc.</li>
    <li> Love it!  My whole family uses it for dry hands and elbows.  Works fast, soaks into your skin with no residue.  My daughter and my husband both use it.</li>
    <li> This is the beat body lotion  I have ever used. My skin is smooth as silk and the scent is very, very light. Downside is that it&#x27;s very hard to find and often retailers hack up the price of it.</li>
    <li> Although this is hard to find, I love the clean and calming smell of this lotion.  It leaves my skin smooth and not greasy.  A+ product</li>
    <li> Wish knew about this sooner. Had to stay at Marriot to use this.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you will like this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.  I use it all over and it makes my skin feel so good.  Try it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I am very scent sensitive - I get migraines easily with certain smells - and this product actually makes my head feel better. This smells sooooo good. It has a clean, fresh (not heavy) scent. And the creamy texture is luxurious. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I love this product . It is luxurious like silk on my skin and absorbs quickly not to mention smells relaxingly great!.</li>
    <li> My wife has lived this lotion ever since discovering it on one of our family trips.</li>
    <li> We tried this lotion in June 2012 when it was provided as one of the bath toiletries at a hotel in Charleston, SC.  My husband loved it on his face after shaving and I thought it was nice, too.  It has a wonderfully, subtle lemony-sage scent that is fine alone, but doesn&#x27;t compete when wearing cologne.  It absorbs well and leaves your skin feeling smooth.  I was unable to locate it in any store nearby, but found it listed on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a great lotion, but the cost makes it a bit pricey; around $16 for the 6.8 oz tube.</li>
    <li> This was given as a sample at a hotel I stayed in while on vacation.  I loved it so much I ordered some as soon as I got home. I even ordered the body wash to go with it.  It&#x27;s such a fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this product as a sample from a hotel and fell in love with it.  It is very creamy and moisturizing and the lemon scent is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I also had the opportunity to try this lotion after staying at a hotel that provided it as a toiletry. I fell in love with it the minute I used it. I have normal to dry skin and I usually need a lotion to go underneath my foundation. I also live in a warm climate, so I don&#x27;t like really thick lotions that feel heavy on my skin when it&#x27;s hot. This lotion was perfect- a light airy feel, but my face felt deeply moisturized. So happy I found it on amazon. Perfect for me!</li>
    <li> Was shipped in a timely manner.  I really like the&lt;br /&gt;smell of this cream and the way it makes my skin feel.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend product.</li>
    <li> BEST moisturizing cream I have ever found!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No greasy feel.... just great smell and smooth skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.\ this cream.</li>
    <li> While on vacation in the Mesa, Az. area, the hotel we stayed at had the little samples of this lotion. My husband doesn&#x27;t like the scents of many lotions but he liked this one. I liked the way it made my hands and feet feel. Living in a dry area, you&#x27;re always looking for something new and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried just searching it and kept coming up with hair products. Grant it Paul Mitchell is well known for his hair products but there&#x27;s other things he makes also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again Amazon came to the rescue. Found it and had a variety of sizes to choose from. I thought about the sample size, that was what I had received from the hotel for the simplicty of taking it where I go. I don&#x27;t remember the count to the back but for one person type deal it would have lasted quiet awhile. But I got the bigger tube so I know I have it and did&#x27;t leave it anywhere  or my favorite I let a friend use it and I never get it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is fantastic and has a very nice scent to it and doesn&#x27;t over whelm you or any one around you.</li>
    <li> I love the Paul Mitchell Lemon Sage Body lotion, but this product was either a knock off, or old.  It did not have the same smell.</li>
    <li> Lovely, light scent and absorbent but rich cream.  I use this product every day and love it.  Protects my skin and makes me feel pampered.</li>
    <li> Trying this at the hotel now. I love the smell and it absorbs not leaving my skin feeling oily, but soon my skin turns dry again. Wish it had more oils. Is there another formula for those of us with dry skin?</li>
    <li> We used this product while staying at a hotel and fell in love with it. But we could not find it in stores. While it was a little pricey, it was worth it.</li>
