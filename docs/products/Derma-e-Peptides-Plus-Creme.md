<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this but haven&#x27;t seen really noticeable results for my deep wrinkles but my skin loves it.</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizer out there in my opinion.  I have been using this for years and nothing compares in this price range.</li>
    <li> I have been using Derma e for about  two years now. The products are perfect for my sensitive skin.  The price is reasonable for the high quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Skin feels softer less noticeable fine lines</li>
    <li> I use it after doing the micro-needle roller, when you open up the skin, the peptides seep into the pores, creating a youthful appearance!</li>
    <li> I liked the cream very well and it makes a good moisturizer.  It performed about as well as Neutrogen which I have used for a long time.  I am now using Roc serum for wrinkles which I think performs very well.  It stings a little at first but then it stops.  I do see a difference in my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This cream is really wonderful and I could see a visible difference after using it.  It will be most excellent for the harsh Winter months, I recommend totally.</li>
    <li> This cream smells wonderful and does a great job at making my skin look great.  I used to have bad skin and this does not flare it up whatsoever. I have tried other creams, more expensive and Im sticking with this one.  I even signed up for the every 2 month shipping program-great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I try this cream 3 days ego its fill nice in face let me use for longer time its good cream for this price</li>
    <li> TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY CHANGES AT ALL IN USING THIS PRODUCT AND IF POSSIBLE&lt;br /&gt;IF I CAN STILL RETURN THIS PRODUCT AND GET MY REFUND.</li>
    <li> this is a very very good moisturizer.  I especially love it after micro-needling.  (&amp; almost every morning &amp; evening).  after using many other products-- I think this one is a true keeper.</li>
    <li> This product is a really good moisturizer. It left my skin soft and I like the scent but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my wrinkles after 3 months of use. I didn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> Good price,smells nice moisturiser ok.If you have nice skin without sun damage this is a good product for you.&lt;br /&gt;If your over 40 and your skin is not perfect I would not waste my money.</li>
    <li> After 3 days my skin looks so much healthier w/ great skin tone and plumped out lines!</li>
    <li> This cream seems to calm your skin. It is very soothing. Wrinkles are smoothed also after a few weeks. It smells good, it is soft and gives you a great skin tone. I rarely alternate my day cream now, because this one works so well for me. You should definitely give it a try...</li>
    <li> I am shocked by the reviews that say this smells good. It smells HORRIBLE. Smell is reminiscent of a nursing home, almost has a urine smell to it. I had to add lavender essential oil to it to tolerate the smell on my face. And it is not just the one I received- I saw it the other day at my natural grocers and smelled the sample and it also smelled awful. As far as the moisturizing goes, it does moisturize, but it causes my skin to be overly oily throughout the day. I have also noticed an increase in pimples (which I have never had a problem with...I&#x27;m 36, don&#x27;t really want to start acne now). I would not recommend this product AT ALL.</li>
    <li> My wife used this product as directed and neither she nor I could see any changes other than her skin was somewhat less dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 56 and have been a sun lover and outdoor person my whole life but as you can imagine it took its tole on my skin.  Since using this product I have decreased the deepest lines and wrinkles and have obliterated the lesser wrinkles.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because I don&#x27;t think any cream can take it all away.</li>
    <li> Dermatologists have long confirmed the effectiveness of peptides in moisturizing skin.  As a result, many products contain it but not in effective amounts.  This product is the real thing.  Friends and I were so pleased when we discovered Derma-E.  We use both the serum and the cream.  Serum in the early morning on freshly cleaned skin and the cream under makeup and a bedtime.  It is easily absorbed.  We all have \\&quot;mixed\\&quot; skin types and have been judged to have wonderful skin texture presently[[ASIN:B000GF1E54 derma e Peptides Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Cr&amp;egrave;me, 2 oz (56 g)]].  Best of all, the price is so right.  We are so happy with the savings over the very expensive products and thrilled with the outcome.</li>
    <li> Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this product.  There&#x27;s better cheaper products in the local drug store.  I was greatly disappointed as it was mostly water!</li>
    <li> I quit using this product to try a few new moisturizers, and am now returning to it.  I can&#x27;t find anything else with this combo of ingredients, and I am very happy with the way it makes my skin look, and with the price!  My only wish is that it were easier to find in stores, but as long as I can find it online, I suppose I am ok.</li>
    <li> Terrific product at good price</li>
    <li> This smelled awful, I had to return it.</li>
    <li> I am 29 years of age and I truly was hoping that this product will work at leat ok based on other reviews. I was not expecting a miracle, but at least some mild results, but I was truly disappointed.  I purchased this derma e peptides and the night version too; but it did not work.  It has some kind of consistency that \\&quot;temporarily\\&quot; gives the impresion that is working, but soon I found out that it was an illusion.  It seems to cover some mild wrinkles but the effect is gone in probably two hours (I can obtain this result with good makeup).  Oh well, good luck to all of you, I am sure that there must be something out there I just have to keep trying!</li>
    <li> Just what the nurse requested.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any results after 6 weeks use.</li>
    <li> I have tried an own the most expensive antiaging products from Lift Fusion $150.00 derma doctor, Lancome you name it and the Derma E line is amazing! not only inexpensive but it actually works!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it because some of the products have Hydrolonic acid but I am sold on all of them, I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me so well but fast shipping</li>
    <li> Excellent product that in time will slowly improve your skin&#x27;s texture and decrease fine lines. One of the best products out there. I am impressed with the cutting edge ingredients utilized in this product. I have used Lancome and Estee Lauder for over 20 years and the Derma e far surpasses them in numberous ways. My skin has never been so healthy.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER written a review for a product before, but I love this product so much I have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 25, and have always taken care of my skin. I read about this product and decided to give it a shot. I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin, and this creme did a few thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Left my skin SO smooth&lt;br /&gt;2. Non greasy feeling&lt;br /&gt;3. Didn&#x27;t make me break out&lt;br /&gt;4. Clearing up my few break outs (not a lot, but so many products make me break out, and this one isn&#x27;t at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, if you have sensitive skin and worried about future wrinkles, definitely use this. It&#x27;s also discounted here on Amazon. I have found it in store for around $50, so you&#x27;re getting a deal here. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I use this every evening. I am always on the lookout for a good night cream. I heard that peptides were beneficial so tried this. I am on my 3rd jar now and love this moisturizer. It does not irritate, sting, and soaks right in. It&#x27;s also fairly inexpensive. I think I will be sticking with this one.</li>
    <li> Very soothing compared to other moisturizers, and great for smoothing fine lines! I periodically get facials and every facial before this last one they have been concerned about my dehydrated skin. But on my most recent visit (after using this product) the facialist said my skin was looking much better!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I could tell the difference the first time I used it.  I have mature skin and this helps so much with fine lines.</li>
    <li> I love Derma E products because they sell high quality skincare products at affordable prices.  Also, the company tends to use natural ingredients which I applaud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lightly scented creme feels fantastic on my face.  It sooths my face and helps to decrease the small lines on my combo skin.  In fact, it sinks right in with no oily residue afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day as a moisturizer before applying make-up, and in the evening I often mix it with other products from Derma E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product at my local health food store paying way too much for it. Determined to continue using this product, I did a Google search and found the best price on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma E Peptides Plus has a pure, clean smell. This product will literally melt into your skin leaving it feel perfectly moisturized and soft. When I began using the product, I noticed a beautiful change in the tone, texture and over all condition of my skin. As several weeks past, the results were stunning. On a recent cruise, my husband and I met several new acquaintances and asked them to guess my age. To my blessing, they guessed me to be ten years to younger than I really am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product twice a day. Once in the morning after my shower and again right before bed. Derma E Peptides Plus has become my all time favorite facial product. This is the one product that I simply will not do without. I truly believe you will be totally satisfied and pleased.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help with what I was hoping for, which is reduction in deep wrinkle noticeability.</li>
    <li> I use this several times a day n never have any greesiness. Am not getting rid of wrinkles but this product softens the look of them</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife I do not know if it works or doesn&#x27;t but I know she looks great.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for seven months now. Have previously purchased thru local nutrition store but Amazon had it for less.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, nor feel sticky or tacky after use, disperses nicely on face. I apply in morning before makeup and in evening after makeup removal. I&#x27;ve found that after a few weeks my pores look smaller, fine lines less noticeable around mouth, eyes and on forehead. After a few months my skin feels less fragile and thin, firmer, more plump and radiant with less rough texture. Not a huge change, but definitely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;For my lips alone I am impressed. It hydrates and plumps them out a bit, an added unexpected bonus, esp given my very thin lips. The thing that it didn&#x27;t help with was with discoloration, blotchiness, redness and small veins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changes happen the most during first few months, and changes seemed to be limited to that with little change after. It still fills out and plumps nicely and I notice if I&#x27;ve skipped it a few days. I noticed what it did for me esp in hindsight when I stopped using to try another product. I went back to the DermaE Peptide after that failed experiment. What I notice also is that it works as a wonderful make-up primer and after using it makeup goes on better and more evenly than with other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried. I notice all I&#x27;ve mentioned the most after adding my foundation, because like I said it doesn&#x27;t help blotchiness or redness, but once that factor is removed I really see it at work on texture. Each container seems to last about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 47 yrs old for reference, average sun damage, melasma, non-smoker and try many different skin products. I don&#x27;t believe that any skin product can do miracles, I&#x27;m realistic but was perfectly happy with what this did for me over other products. I only write reviews on things that really impress me, either for good or bad.</li>
    <li> I will be 60 years old in a couple of months. I&#x27;ve used products (serums) that cost over $150.00 for only 0.5 ounce for 3 months, and didn&#x27;t get the results that I received from DermaE after 1 week. I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month now and I sometimes forget the night time application (morning and evening applications are recommended), but still achieved great results. Other products failed to reduce the tiny lines above my cheek bones, but this product completely eliminated them. I was amazed. Let&#x27;s face it ladies and gents, NOTHING is going to remove the skin damage that some people have due to over exposing their skin to the sun, diet, smoking, and other damaging habits people subjected their skin to over long periods of time.  An alternative to using creams is plastic surgery and/or Botox. Plastic surgery is an option but results are not always what you want, and Botox can and has been disastrous to many that have used it. Not to ignore the fact that you have to continue to invest in Botox treatments forever. That being said, I will continue to use this very nicely priced product with enthusiasm.</li>
    <li> I only was asble to use this once so far.  It just came yesterday so please don&#x27;t ask me to give a review on this product</li>
    <li> Nothing special about the cream.</li>
    <li> This product is a no nonsense skin cream, I got noticeable results in a couple of weeks.  I have used it before and found it reasonably priced with this seller. I love the way it makes my skin feel very supple. I have normal to dry skin especially in the winter months when the weather is extreme, and my skin takes a beating, this cream is great for restoring moisture.  I found this cream does help with my skins elasticity.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Yes this cream does have a peculiar odor (not that bad though) when you first put it on but it quickly dissipates.  I think it works as well as Hydroxytone for a fraction of the price.  My skin feels firmer and smoother.  I will definitely be reordering this product.</li>
    <li> I use this as my night cream and wake up with such soft skin.  I follow up with Derma e day crime and notice a difference in my pores, skin softness and even complexion.  Highly recco as a night crime---too heavy for day.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this feels going on. It is very rich and a little goes a very long way. This is part of the reason I gave it only 4 stars - if you use too much, it doesn&#x27;t blend in well, which can be annoying. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give a full review but it seems to be diminishing my forehead lines. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I say \\&quot;almost\\&quot; because I&#x27;m not sure anything can \\&quot;reverse\\&quot; wrinkles, especially for someone like me in my sixth decade.  But I do believe it retards the wrinkling process and at the same time gives your skin a great feel and texture.  It almost pinks it up a little, but not in an irritating way.  I even like it better than most Olay Regenerist skin products, with the exception of [[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces]] which is, for me, the best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried for improving skin texture.  This derma e product, however, improves texture and moisturizes at the same time.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Most successful form of couples therapy is the basis of this book. Highly recommend for any marriage or relationship issues</li>
    <li> little sample foil packets were available at Whole Foods which I took with me on on a trip flying to the midwest - I had several compliments on my complexion - I&#x27;m sure it was a little voodoo from this product.  I actually bought a jar after the sample ran out (and I&#x27;m a bit of a penny-pincher).  I like products that you can actually see results from (not necessarily permanent results) but results that last through an event or evening.</li>
    <li> This product is very thick, yet not greasy.  You do have to apply it generously, it is hard to smooth evenly unless you use a decent amount of product.  Definetly more of a treatment than a moisturizer.  Doesn&#x27;t moisturize all that great and it doesn&#x27;t give you that nice clean moisturized feeling after application.  It does have great ingredients however I am not very impressed and expected more.[[ASIN:B000GF1E54 derma e Peptides Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Cr&amp;egrave;me, 2 oz (56 g)]]</li>
    <li> Am using this as an aging preventive.  Hope it will do what I expect, ask me in ten years!  it is easy to spread, odorless, and arrived on time.  so I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I used the alpha hydroxy derma e which I like better because i think it hydrates better. This also has a slight scent, which causes my eyes to burn a little. I am extremely sensitive to fragrances...so, I only share this if you are looking for something natural without any irritation at all.</li>
    <li> It works. It softens skin for hours. The price is just too high for me.&lt;br /&gt;Coconuts oil also works almost as well.</li>
    <li> The company makes high quality products very reasonably priced. I am so happy I found this company! All the products I have purchased I recommend and use on a regular basis and will continue to purchase. You can&#x27;t go wrong with any of their products. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin, but actually has an effect!  In only a few days, I don&#x27;t have those little crepey lines around my mouth!  I sent back some very expensive products to one of those network shopping places after getting this product!  I can compare this to some other skin creams I have paid over $100 for!  Seriously, this is scary!  I am trying several other Derma e products as they are great bargains and very high quality.  This stuff works!  (We all need to review when we buy, because I only bought when I read others&#x27; reviews!  Come on \\&quot;gals\\&quot;, review the beauty items when you buy!!)</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this however my skin hates it. I had massive breakouts and now just use it on my hands.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past three weeks, really like the way it makes my skin feel, not sure if it is reversing my wrinkles yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and reordering it.  Will continue to use it.  I really don&#x27;t think it reverses deep wrinkles but it does soften them......I have really deep wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I use this cream, for my night cream.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, and blends in well.&lt;br /&gt;I wake up, to softer skin, on my face.</li>
    <li> At age 63, my mother was spending $200 of her hard earned money annually on department store brands.  It didn&#x27;t seem right that half of the purchase price went straight to brand marketing. She is not fluent in English, so I conducted a search on her behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After screening dozens of face creams for safe and effective ingredients via the Skin Deep database, this particular cream stood out for its avoidance of parabens and skin firming acids.  It works well with her sensitive skin and helps it stand up to the Southern California desert climate.  It&#x27;s even firmed up her wrinkles.  Her skin is clearer, as in significantly less spots.  She and her friends are now converts.  Thanks Derma E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- It&#x27;s been 9 years since my mother started using this cream.  She still looks 12 years younger than her age, but there are definitely visible fine lines.  For 72, fine lines are a good problem to have.  She is a religious sun avoider, carrying sun hats and parasols everywhere she goes.  I attribute her behavior to why this cream was so efficacious.</li>
    <li> This review probably won&#x27;t get posted, because it&#x27;s not a good one. This product, like everything else we&#x27;re suckered into, does not work. I&#x27;ve given it a month, and there is no change whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I have never known a creme to be so rich and it holds the moisture throughout the whole day and into the night.  I use the derma e Microdermabrasion Scrub twice a week and this creme morning and night and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results. No more dryness or dullness....these are excellent products and I have now made them my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer almost every morning. It goes on smoothly and penetrates the skin very quickly. I want to say that my skin is more elastic since using this product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have very dry skin &amp; sun damage.  This cream moisturizes &amp; plumps up over lines.  Absorbs very nicely too.</li>
    <li> The disappointing short answer is that this product doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been through the whole jar, usually applying once a day, sometimes twice and no change to my crows feet whatsoever!!! Truth is it&#x27;s not even a great moisturizer, having a waxy feel on application. Smells good, reasonable value for money and cruelty free, but who cares when it doesn&#x27;t do the job? I&#x27;m 40, vegetarian (so reasonable diet &#x3D; reasonably good skin), but I think the only way to reduce my crows feet is by not smiling LOL!!!! Oh and no I didn&#x27;t expect to gain the skin of a 20 year old, my expectations were to see softening!</li>
    <li> I have been faithfully using it for a month on wrinkles around my mouth and have seen no improvements.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
    <li> I used this cream when I was pregnant with my first in my early 20&#x27;s. My mom saw on Dr. Oz how peptides are the only thing that can actually prevent stretch marks by getting down deep in the skin. I have to say I was skeptical but thought it was worth a shot, especially since I&#x27;ve always heard &#x27;you&#x27;ll know how many you&#x27;ll get by how many your mom got&#x27;(stretch marks). Well lets just say she has way more than I ever want, and I was willing to at least try something to prevent myself from getting them. Well I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark anywhere I used this cream!! I didn&#x27;t use it on my sides at first because I wanted to make it last, well thats the only place I got them! And once I saw that I started using it on them too and didn&#x27;t get one more there! I only used one container and still had some after I had baby so I used it on my breasts while breastfeeding, again I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark. And just to prove to you I am very susceptible to them, (because even I thought that wrinkle cream can&#x27;t be used for a stretch mark cream, so maybe I just wasn&#x27;t going to get any to begin with!) I stopped using it on my breasts after just a couple weeks because we were going on vacation and it was almost gone. Within a week my breasts were like a tiger had clawed at them! Purple and itchy and so unattractive! So now I&#x27;m pregnant with #2 and have been looking at every store for a wrinkle cream with peptides. No luck until now! So excited to order this and start using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product twice a day for several weeks.  I have noticed a significant difference in my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  Will continue to buy.  Notice a huge difference after one jar.</li>
    <li> Ever since switching to natural/organic products that do not contain any questionable ingredients like parabens I discovered derma-e brand and was very happy with most of their products. This one is one of their best daily moisturizer creams that works wonders on my skin. I notice visible difference when I do not use this product (it&#x27;s that kind of difference I do not want to see).</li>
    <li> Ok, I wanted to wait a few weeks to use this product before reviewing it.  I am the type of consumer that will only purchase anti-wrinkle cream if I have a little tester of it first to try.  I have tried about 5 different kinds in the past 5 months, and refuse to buy if they don&#x27;t work!  Anti-wrinkle creams are $$!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am turning 35 in a month and have started to get self-conscious about my eye wrinkles...i think I smile too much:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I purchased this product on a whim JUST from all the positive reviews. I have been using it twice a day for the past 3 weeks and I can honestly see a difference!  My wrinkles don&#x27;t seem as deep and are definitely less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair and sensitive skin, I wear under-eye concealer daily... and this anti-wrinkle cream  has not caused any strange skin reactions.  I am excited to try other products by this brand!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my spouse who was looking for a &#x27;better&#x27; wrinkle cream as she is spending an arm and a leg on brand cremes that do nothing but make her face glisten.&lt;br /&gt;So we read up on the reviews and found this brand to be generally well received. 5 stars for a cream? Youse gots to be kidding. This stuff will remove dents from my car! Anyways, all kidding aside: having used for 2 months her comments are that it is a great moisturizer and feels great on the skin but it has not visibly improved the semi-deep wrinkles between her eyebrows and besides her eyes. We want it to work but alas, with steady use as prescribed, we have seen nothing visible. She will keep on using it because it is a good creme at a very reasonable price but perhaps we expected too much result? Or her wrinkles are unlike any kind this company has dealt with? (Just kidding, sweetheart).&lt;br /&gt;Hope that this blance towards the lower rating does not upset the believers but we cannot see the results we expected. 5 stars for a great cream moisturizer, and -2 stars for leaving the crows feet and wrinkles untouched. Since no other cream has ever helped with wrinkles we still consider this a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;If you disagree, please blame it on our high expectations!</li>
    <li> In general, I&#x27;ve found derma e products to be helpful for my skin. I use the derma e line daily; have never had any problems with allergic reactions, etc. I like the fact that they&#x27;re natural.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if Derma E Wrinkle Peptide Moisturizer reduces wrinkles yet but the moisturizer smells nice and has a good consistency.  I have only gone through one jar.  I had purchased two and am just starting on the second one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and was hoping for a miracle I guess. This did nothing as claimed. I used it for a month and couldn&#x27;t tell that it was used at all.</li>
    <li> I gave the product 5 stars as it did great things for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent and easy application. I would definitely purchase&lt;br /&gt;it again. As usual speedy delivery by Amazon and great packaging&lt;br /&gt;by Derma e!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love Derma e products. Great results, reasonably priced</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really see much change</li>
    <li> light weight.doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.no detectable fragrance or synthetic ingredients.could be a little more moisturizing.after using it for a month,it may have actually helped my wrinkles a bit.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference using this cream, unfortunately. I typically like this line of product, however this item seems to not do anything beyond moisturize at a staggering price.</li>
    <li> It felt good on my skin but I didn&#x27;t notice any change. It clogged my pores. It might work for you.</li>
    <li> This is a very light cream moisturizer.  It is very easy to smooth on your skin and it absorbs very easily.  Leaves your skin&lt;br /&gt;feeling really soft.  A little goes a long way.  You don&#x27;t have to use very much to cover your entire face.  Really nice</li>
    <li> I discovered this cream by listening to the Dr. talk shows so thought I&#x27;d get on Amazon and give it a try.  I&#x27;m on my second jar and will probably be replacing all my other creams with this product for my neck and face.</li>
    <li> No miracle wrinkle remover but it is a very nice moisturizer for aging dry skin. Nice savings online compared to store prices !</li>
    <li> This cream goes on smooth, causes no skin irritation and definitely softens wrinkles.  No, it is not a miracle.  Only the plastic surgeon and chemical peels are, but if that&#x27;s not your buzz, this is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a less expensive option for a peptide moisturizer.  This was gentle on my sensitive skin, and a good moisturizer, but I did not see a noticeable improvement in facial tightening, or any dramatic change in  existing fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The Derma E Peptide Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Cream has been keeping my face feeling soft, reducing the wrinkles around my eyes, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  I started with this day cream but I just purchased the Night Hydraulonic acid creme to see if I get better results.  So far so good.  It would be nice to have an SPF of 30 in these products so I&#x27;m using a sunscreen on top of the moisturizer.  My skin is very fair and sensitive and this product is doing it&#x27;s job!  I really want to take care of my skin even though I&#x27;m 32 with a few wrinkles.  I look forward to the Vanilla Bean Cleanser I purchased as well.  Will review everything I use.</li>
    <li> I bought the product after all the rave reviews. Honestly I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working or not. I read somewhere (after buying this product) that castor oil is great (along with other natural products) and I tried that, getting better results. (It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily either). So I think I will stick with that since it&#x27;s cheaper and the results are faster. Nothing against this product though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged male who is starting to get wrinkles on my forehead and i want to look youthful as long as i can. And as a male we can&#x27;t use makeup to hide wrinkles, so i wanted to find a creme to help reduce wrinkles. Watching Dr. Oz, he suggested using moisturizers to hydrate skin. I specifically like this Derma e formula because peptides help reduce wrinkles and skin sagging. Along with peptides(which promotes skin collagen) this creme also includes pycnogenol which helps plump up the skin in the crevice of the wrinkle. After reading reviews here and getting recommended in a few magazines, i purchased Derma e w/peptides. I use it after i get out of the shower in the morning and before i go to bed at night. It has a smell to it, like a medical smell but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad by any means. Once you put the creme on, and your skin absorbs it, the smell goes away. Along with Derma e i use Jack Black Deep Dive Glycolic Facial Cleaner once a week as a facial mask. (Yes this sounds weird coming from a guy but hey we want to look good too!) I can honestly say that i notice a big improvement using Derma e! Now lets be clear, this does NOT make wrinkles disappear but it plumps up the skin in the crevice of the wrinkle. I can definitely see an improvement. The 2 oz. jar lasts a long time too. I bought it 2 months ago and i use it everyday and the jar is a little more than half gone. (Oh! Dr Oz recommends you use your ring finger to put on moisturizer because that finger will apply less pressure than your index finger) For the results you get, you can&#x27;t beat the price for Derma e Deep Wrinkle w/Peptides. I highly recommend it! ---- Jeremy from Providence, RI</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried sever Derma E products over the last year all promising to diminish wrinkles. None of them did a thing for me. I really expected better..... (sad face)</li>
    <li> so far I like this product no reaction from my sensitive skin, nice and smooth!like this derma line , will try othe products, LOVE the rehydrating serum!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for gently smoothing out the wrinkles by relaxing fine lines and some deeper ones as well. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a delightful creme for the face.  I don&#x27;t know if it does what it sets out to do but I like the light feel of it and odor is mild.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for almost 7 months now on daily basis. While I also use Swiss Ultimate for trouble spots, this is a great all over moisturizer and provides some argireline as well.</li>
    <li> I love natural products, and this one is fantastic. My skin feels so good after using it. The entire derma e line is great.</li>
    <li> Very rich and creamy, non greasy, I use it day and night</li>
    <li> this is a good product, especially for the price. i recently stopped using an expensive &#x27;natural&#x27; brand to use this instead. i believe this is working just as well. it&#x27;s very moisturizing. it&#x27;s too soon to say for sure how it&#x27;s working on the wrinkles, though my skin looks pretty great (just as good as with a brand that cost about three times as much).</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizing cream and use it day and night. The shuttle ylang ylang essences is calming as well</li>
    <li> I am now a Derma-e fan! This is my second time ordering this face creme. I always order creams and then there is something about them I don&#x27;t like and I never finish them. This is the first one I&#x27;ve actually finished and ordered again. It&#x27;s not too light or too thick and I like the smell. I heard that peptides are the way to go to help rejuvenate collagen so I went with this product. It also doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the extra ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce, which is important for me to stay away from and one of the main reasons I bought it in the first place. I HIGHLY recommend this product and I will continue to buy Derma-e from now on. And, even though this is a 2 oz, a little goes a long way so it lasts me a while.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good eye and face moisturizer that had the ingredients that I was looking for and this fits the bill. My skin is brighter the darkening circles I seem to get in the winter have faded and I just love how it makes my skin feel. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles so can&#x27;t offer up any insignt in that area, but this creme is great and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I heard peptides talked about on the Dr. Oz show.  I wanted to try It.I have beenuseing this cream about 3 weeksand a lot of my wrinkeshave disapeard and others are not as deep. My skin is softer. I am 80 years old</li>
    <li> This works better than more expensive products for diminishing circles under your eyes.  I have a little bit of a &amp;#34;ledge&amp;#34; between the depression from the circles under my eyes and the skin at the top of my cheek, so I don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s a product available to take that away completely, but this one is impressive in how much it diminishes that depression and the under-eye circles.  It&#x27;s definitely an excellent product, especially for the money.  You get a ton of product and only need a tiny bit each use.  I can&#x27;t even imagine when I will get to the bottom of this jar!  :o)</li>
    <li> i like this stuff  its good</li>
    <li> This is a most wonderful product. It goes on smoothly, is not greasy, and best of all, works. Other family members have noticed a difference in my face as well (without my asking them). I discovered quite by accident that the wrinkles on my arms are also disappearing after I started smoothing the excess over these areas. Only a very thin application is needed. This one&#x27;s definitely a winner.</li>
    <li> I use this in combo with a few other Derma e products for the past couple months, it&#x27;s moisturizing and I like how it feels but I don&#x27;t notice anything special with my face.</li>
    <li> love every derma e product i&#x27;ve ever tried. the only product line i use now.</li>
    <li> When you order the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; be sure to tell them that is all you want.  They have tried to bill my account 185.00 for a 39.99 special order by stating &amp;#34;with your order today you will get ___ free&amp;#34;  just pay shipping and handling.  I&#x27;m not happy about this and will not buy anything else from Beach Body.&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie Radford</li>
    <li> I use only at night as it&#x27;s very rich and seems to curdle a bit if I put to much on in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found after using this product for about 4 months straight, nothing is really slowing the process down.  I&#x27;m still getting the crows feet, I have not noticed any lines diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to give it a 2 star, but I have no choice as I am editing a post I added a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just an expensive moisturiser, it won&#x27;t help you get rid of the lines, I was hoping it would, as I&#x27;m 55, but it&#x27;s a scam.... sorry but it&#x27;s the truth, I tried it for over 4 months to make sure I was right...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will keep on looking for the &#x27;miracle&#x27; furmula... this is not it...</li>
    <li> What a disappointment!  The cream sits on top of the skin, doesn&#x27;t blend in and therefor hardly moisturizes.  Didn&#x27;t do a thing for the fine lines and actually, I think they may be looking worse!  Only thing I can say for it is that it doesn&#x27;t smell and I can use it around my eyes without irritating them.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural unscented cream with recognizable ingredients that would take care of  forehead wrinkles and deep nasolabial folds-this cream actually worked and I could see a difference after one use!! It has a very mild fragrance and I love it!</li>
    <li> Not as thrilled with this as I thought I would be from the reviews. It&#x27;s got an unpleasant texture and smell. The smell is like licorice -- and not in a good way.</li>
    <li> I love this derma e product.  Its really creamy, has lots of wonderful vitamins in it , and it keeps my skin feeling soft all day</li>
    <li> I have NOT seen any results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a couple of years and it works really well for moisture and plumping up fine lines.  I also use it with my Light Stim which is a hand held light that produces collagen to get rid of your laugh lines, in between eye lines, and fine lip lines.  This cream is a must have for that purpose.  The price is awesome as well and a little goes a long way.  It has all the necessary ingredients as higher priced creams.  Derma e is a very reputable company with paraben free products.</li>
    <li> This was a nice cream; it did a good job on wrinkles as promised but, within about a week it had upset my very sensitive skin and rosacea bigtime. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve seen the rosacea at all, let alone to this extreme extent.  Though it is sold as an all natural formulation, I&#x27;ve got a bad reaction to something in there.  If you have rosacea, you grok that this could be THE deal breaker!  If not, you may want to try this cream.  I think it made me look younger, before \\&quot;kapow!\\&quot;, I reacted to it. Non-rosacea-inducing moisturizers that seem to work well for me: just plain old coconut oil from the health food store, and squalane, which, I am told, is a fraction of olive oil that closely resembles natural human oils.  This stuff is more expensive but a little goes a very long way; found some online at Soapcraft.ca.  I have also found that Kiss My Face sunblock holds moisture &amp; does not bother the rosacea.</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay Regenerist for five years and my wrinkles have just gotten deeper and deeper around my mouth and eyes.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this, less than a month, I can see visible results.  My lines are smoother and some are actually fading away.  The crows feet and dark circles under my eyes are 100% improved.  I will continue using this product because, if it does this much in 3 weeks, imagine what it could do in 3 years!  Also, my skin is much softer overall and more supple.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I went along with all the raving and ranting about this product.  I ordered the dry skin formula, but it rolls up into tiny balls.  This lack of absorption is unacceptable. I find myself having to add water to my face to dissolve the product back into a cream.  I didn&#x27;t need to spend a pretty penny to achieve this result. I am also not crazy about the scent either, as I found it to be a little off. Lastly, I&#x27;ve been using it for at least one month.  So far, no improvement. So much for a helping hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad as just a moisturizer, but, after several months, it hasn&#x27;t seemed to do too much for the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> makes your skin really smoothI am 64 and started using all of the products</li>
    <li> This moisturizer really makes my skin soft and helps smooth fine lines and wrinkles. Love the peptides, been reading about how good they are for your skin. This has all the great things ifor my skin to be glowing and soft. It&#x27;s so creamy and goes on my skin so nicely, perfectly smooth and wrinkle free.</li>
    <li> makes skin supple and plump, positive results.</li>
    <li> Cream goes on smoothly.  It made my skin tags smaller on my neck and upper chest.  Ran out, skin tags seem to be coming back, but slowly (4-6 months)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> nice product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and have also gotten a relative of mine to use it.  It really soften my creases and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is a reasonably priced product but not a high performer on my face. My quest for the perfect face cream continues...</li>
    <li> feels good on your face</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, and was so happy to find it on Amazon at half the price I was paying. My best friend, who is in the natural food and other products industry, told me this had the &#x27;cleanest&#x27; ingredients of any product she had ever seen. I constantly get complimented on my skin. At 51, that&#x27;s quite a treat!</li>
    <li> This product does not remove wrinkles but it did soften them a little and left my skin looking fresh and healthy.This is the first time in 40 plus yrs that I&#x27;ve used anything new on my face, I&#x27;ve recently ordered my 2nd jar so I must be pleased somewhat with the results.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Arrived in tact.</li>
    <li> I like this product line</li>
    <li> I like the creme, although it does little for deep wrinkles. Still, it feels good and healthy on skin, and seem to fight small aging lines.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and was very happy with the results. Over time, I felt that it definitely improved my skin. However, I returned the last two jars because there are obvious quality control problems. The first jar was thicker than usual and full of small white lumps. Amazon sent another at no charge. The consistency of this one was almost like a lotion (liquid), a much darker pink color, and greasy. I&#x27;ve emailed the company to inquire.</li>
    <li> firms skin. But once you stop using it, it goes back to normal</li>
    <li> It moisturizes nicely but it has a formaldehyde type smell that puts me off.</li>
    <li> I used it for awhile, broke out in the most horrible cystic acne so I stopped. Cleared up some so I tried it again....horrible cystic acne again. I must be very sensitive to natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am just finishing my first jar of Derma e Peptides Plus. I have noticed some of my fine lines diminished and my skin is smoother overall. I have really sensitive skin and this product has worked better for me than any other I have tried. I like to mix a little of it with my makeup base as well when applying my makeup. My skin looks hydrated and not as dry in areas as it was prior to this. I also get eczema on my neck and arms and when I apply this cream on it, the itching and burning subsides and calmed. I am about to order my next jar!</li>
    <li> I tried this derma e&#x27;s product as a less expensive version of Victoria Principles facial line. I&#x27;m happy to say, that they seem to be working and really do relax my facial muscles. I&#x27;ve noticed the lines in my upper lip slackening up and aren&#x27;t as easy to purse up. (which I didn&#x27;t realize I was doing, along with the frown expressions too)&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff</li>
    <li> This is the third Derma E product I have purchased and I am pleased with all of them.  This particular moisturizer feels a little greasy on application, but is quickly absorbed.  I do not wear makeup, but at 71 I do need a moisturizer and am quite pleased with how nice it makes my skin look.  It doesn&#x27;t have a sun screen, so this summer I will have to put this on at night and something else in the morning.</li>
    <li> Awesome face cream...definitely has gotten me hooked on Derma e products and will be trying more of them ASAP!  It smells fresh and light, kind of an addicting scent to me. It&#x27;s a thick, creamy consistency, but soaks into skin quickly.  Definitely reduces fine lines and I&#x27;ve only been using it for not even a month yet!  Best part?  This company is VEGAN and CRUELTY FREE!</li>
    <li> Really great lotion that doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
    <li> Absorbs into skin quickly and leaves very soft.  Have not seen changes yet in lines or firmness.  Overall happy with product as a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> FEELS GREAT AND DOES SMOOTH OUT FINE LINES AND MOISTURIZE WITHOUT FEELING GREASY.  USE IT DAY AND NIGHT. ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS FOR THE MONEY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not positive, but I wonder if the formula changed. Anyone know? It&#x27;s pink and as a general rule, I LOVE AND RECOMMEND THESE PRODUCTS. LOVE that I can get them on Amazon. Would love to know they are not a knock off.</li>
    <li> The odor isn&#x27;t pleasant and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement on my lines, they are fine, nothing too severe. But it didn&#x27;t lessen them.</li>
    <li> At first it seems really nice and smells great. But it&#x27;s actually quite a sticky product and I&#x27;m forcing myself to finish it because I bought it. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive adult skin that is prone to breakouts.  After about a few weeks my skin was feeling great, then I started breaking out.  What a bummer.</li>
    <li> love, love, love this lotion</li>
    <li> Yes, I do like this product.  Will get another.</li>
    <li> Nice thick calming moisture. Not sure yet about how it will work on wrinkles but we will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Every time I seem to use this on my face, I get red and blotchy, so I have just going to leave it as an eye only, hopefully that works ok. I read that this product is suppose to be great for sensitive skin, not so sure.</li>
    <li> Though I don&#x27;t notice any wrinkles disappearing, the cream has kept my face soft through our harsh winter weather.  I am not fond of the fragrance but at least it is not offensive.</li>
    <li> I use it in combination with Skinceuticals CE/CE Ferulic NIB and it works great.  My wrinkles have almost disappeared!!  I especially noticed around my lips and forehead.  I&#x27;m placing my second order now.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this cream but it did not do anything for my skin. If anything the cream felt heavy and my skin felt saggier. It has 0 tightening/ lifting effect. I used for 30 days and did not experience any wrinkle reduction. I have had better experiences with drug store brands. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> Facial skin has improved in color and moisture retention.  Very good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations</li>
    <li> I use this cream most days. It&#x27;s great under make up, and never irritates. I have tried a few higher-priced creams, and found them less effective; i.e. after several years of using Derma E peptide formulas, I see very few new wrinkles. No cream will reverse the aging process, but Derma E products seem genuinely to protect and preserve the health of skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this cream at all. It causes puffiness under my eyes (and who wants that?). I&#x27;m using it on my feet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day for four weeks and really like it. it is thick and rich but not oily. I like that it is cruelty free and inexpensive to purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about wrinkles, but it is a good moisturizer for the money. I&#x27;m 64 years young and very lucky, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles at all. The few I do have are still there after using this product for approximately a year. Did they prevent any new wrinkles, I really can&#x27;t say. Others have said it erased their wrinkles, I don&#x27;t know that any product out there does that. But that being said, it is a good moisturizer and worth the try. Good luck with your wrinkles!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t really seen any difference by using this product</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. When you first put it on, you will definitely see fading, but as the day goes on, all of them are back. However, I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of new wrinkles forming. This could be because of genetics or this stuff. I love it and would recommend it. I put it around my eyes and upper lip, and what&#x27;s left on my fingers and put around my whole face.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, there really is no noticeable effect after considerable length of time. At least 6 mos. I am over 60 and have deep forehead wrinkles. Had my hopes up but movin&#x27; on. Smells nice though.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff, I wear it day and night, under makeup or without. It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly and never feels heavy. I have noticed that my fine lines are finer and softer wrinkles.its not a miracle cream, but does a decent job!</li>
    <li> This product keeps my skin from drying out from lack of moisture in the air.  Provides moisture and helps with softness.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way</li>
