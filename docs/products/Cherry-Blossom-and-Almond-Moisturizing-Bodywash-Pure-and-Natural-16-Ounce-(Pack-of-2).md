      <li>I love Pure &amp; Natural Moisturizing Body Wash</li>
      <li>but the body was itself was also different, it was more of a gel and not the moisturizing body wash that I&#x27;ve always bought.</li>
      <li>Love this item only bath wash</li>
      <li>You should only need a quarter-sized dollop at the most.</li>

      <li>This is the only body wash I have been able to use for the last 4-5 years.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this soap to everyone</li>

      <li>Definitely not up to my standards of being safe to use anymore...Am no longer buying unless they change back to their old formula!</li>
      <li>it also works really well for people with sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>All natural and smells heavenly!  </li>
      <li>I like the smell, but it&#x27;s a little strong.</li>
      <li>We only use Pure &amp; Natural body wash.</li>

      <li>It feels smooth and hydrated, not tight or dried out.</li>
      <li>The bottles we placed in plastic bags that were not sealed and the caps on the bottles were not tight - therefore they leaked all over the box.  </li>
      <li>Used to be able to find it in all the retail stores, now can only find it on Amazon - not sure why.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelmingly strong either, but it&#x27;s definitely on the strong end of the spectrum.</li>
      <li>If you do not have sensitive skin, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
      <li>It does not dry out your skin and the softness lasts.</li>
      <li>I would call it an average product that does not seem to have any real downside.  </li>

    <li> The fact that this product is \\&quot;natural\\&quot; is irrelevant to me.  I purchase things based on smell and this smells amazing.  It&#x27;s got a good flower smell AND a good almond smell (much like the almond extract you cook with). I can&#x27;t find this product in store any longer, but that&#x27;s fine with me because Amazon has it cheaper anyway.  This fragrance is not a light, subtle fragrance like a lot of other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products can be.  It&#x27;s not overwhelmingly strong either, but it&#x27;s definitely on the strong end of the spectrum.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Feels great and smells best. Used to be able to find it in all the retail stores, now can only find it on Amazon - not sure why. A bit expensive and worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell.  I actually us it for hand soap at my kitchen sink.  Helps get rid of onion and other food smells left on your hands.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it would smell like Jerkins Cherry and Almond lotion. I am very disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t. I will probably give  the other unopened bottle away as a gift and hope they like it, I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The Pure &amp; Natural bodywash is a great product. It moisturizes and leaves your skin wonderfully scented it also works really well for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this moisturizing body wash is just intoxicating. It is not overly sweet, yet it is wonderfully feminine and relaxing.It does not dry out your skin and the softness lasts.</li>
    <li> Ny wife has allergies to certain body wash products and finds this brand perfect and non irritating. She has a hard time finding it in the local markets, so getting it in bulk from Amazon is the way to go. If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend this product.</li>

    <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister this holiday season. She loves the smell and kept lamenting the fact that I had a full bottle in my shower and wouldn&#x27;t give her it. For some reason our local Walmart stopped selling it, and she couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else for purchase. You needed to know this because it smells so great we went to war over it! This is a great price for two bottles. It was more money at the department store when they sold it. It leaves you feeling clean and smelling great all day.</li>
    <li> This product gives your skin a nice fresh aroma. If you do not have sensitive skin, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I have eczema and it has really improved my dry patches on my arms, it smells amazing, bottles are HUGE so it will last me a good while and the scent stays on you for a bit too. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this body wash it does the job but it isnt 100% natural...but overall cant complain it smells great but still would rather go with 100% natural but this is still a great bodywash ...</li>
    <li> Love this item only bath wash I use,recommend this item to all my friends and family ,this time is so good for the skin</li>
    <li> My wife just loves this soap the smell is great and she loves the smell it makes her skin fill soft</li>
    <li> I love this soap, I&#x27;m highly allergic to most soaps, this one is gentle on the skin and really moisturizes</li>
    <li> We only use Pure &amp; Natural body wash. I love how healthy it is for your skin and the smell is amazing. It just wakes you up in the morning. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a severe latex allergy and multi-chemical sensitivity. This is the only body wash I have been able to use for the last 4-5 years.  When I first discovered it I was able to buy it locally but due to it&#x27;s low volume sales the local store dropped it from their stock.  I was very excited to find it at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with allergies be sure to read the label.</li>
    <li> It did the job it was supposed to do but it&#x27;s not as nice smelling as I hoped. I just used it because it was there, but I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but it&#x27;s a little strong. I love the way my skin feels. It feels smooth and hydrated, not tight or dried out. I would be sure not to use to much. You should only need a quarter-sized dollop at the most. Love that it&#x27;s paraben free and made in the USA!</li>
    <li> Terrific in the shower!  All natural and smells heavenly!  Leaves a lasting scent in the bathroom and you feel clean all day!</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. She likes the smell and it doesn&#x27;t make her itch at all. The price is unbeatable as well.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this bodywash at the Walmart in my area, but they stopped selling it.  I believe it was the only bodywash that didn&#x27;t make my sensitive-skinned daughter and youngest son itch like crazy after a bath or shower.  I love the scent because it smells just right and it&#x27;s not overpowering and I love the fact that the ingredients are derived from mostly (I think) natural ingredients.  I&#x27;m glad to find it again.</li>
    <li> I have eczema, and cystic acne, and this is the Only soap that doesn&#x27;t freak out any of my problem areas. Leaves me feeling moisturized, and smells wonderful. Very sad to see it now contains propylene glycol, which is the supposed &amp;#34;safe antifreeze&amp;#34; that is now subject in the Beneful dog food case, as the ingredient which is responsible for killing thousands of pets. :( This seller however, is great. Super fast shipping, and the items were very safely packed, would definitely go through them again!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to all soaps with the exception of this product.  I used to be able to buy it in town but they quit carrying it.  Then I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I had bought at least $100 worth of other products that I ended up throwing away because I couldn&#x27;t use them.  Then I found it here.  I am thrilled!!  Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and it&#x27;s kind to the skin, but leaves a terrible soap scum in the shower/bathtub.  It may be due to the hard water. I don&#x27;t know, but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent.  I have used it before.  The packaging was very poor.  The bottles we placed in plastic bags that were not sealed and the caps on the bottles were not tight - therefore they leaked all over the box.  Was not happy with they were sent.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma and the smoothing effect it give you after a shower. I,d buy it many times. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Freaking love this soap. Smells great and leaves me feeling clean and refreashed.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this soap to everyone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and was disappointed to find out it was no longer sold in stores.  This soap lathers up great, smells great and doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin like some soaps do.  Having sensitive skin, I find that this product does not cause any irritation either.</li>
    <li> Loved this product until I recently ordered it and opened the box to find out that they had changed not only the look of the product, but the whole product almost completely! A lot of the ingredients have been changed...I don&#x27;t see how they can say this is hypo-allergenic still when it contains soybean extract in the new ingredients which is one of the top allergens! Also, it now contains propylene glycol (which is a type of supposed \\&quot;non-toxic\\&quot; anti-freeze),and Yellow 6 which has been shown to cause allergic reactions in some people. Definitely not up to my standards of being safe to use anymore...Am no longer buying unless they change back to their old formula! VERY disappointed!</li>
    <li> This smell is overwhelming. I would not buy again and i do not feel clean after using.</li>
    <li> I am fond of the cherry-almond scent, this wash is great &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. It smells almost like a new Barbie doll, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I love Pure &amp; Natural Moisturizing Body Wash but when I ordered it it sent me something \\&quot;NEW\\&quot;.  The bottle was different which is fine but the body was itself was also different, it was more of a gel and not the moisturizing body wash that I&#x27;ve always bought.</li>
