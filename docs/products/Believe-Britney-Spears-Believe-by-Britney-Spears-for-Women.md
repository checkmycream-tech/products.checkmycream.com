      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
      <li>I have been loyal to the Britney Spears fragrance line (I absolutely love and recommend Curious, Fantasy, and Circus Fantasy) and received this item for Christmas.</li>

      <li>This scent if very woody/musty.</li>
      <li>While that doesn&#x27;t seem like much, I was blown away.</li>

      <li>Not as sweet as the other scents.</li>
      <li>I was very excited and expected something great but was disappointed by the scent of Believe.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fade away quick like some other perfumes out there.  </li>
      <li>It smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
      <li>I am very hesitant to buy things online, especially from a website I&#x27;ve never heard of, that&#x27;s an outside purchase of Amazon.</li>
      <li>It reminded me of going to the mall and passing through various perfume sections; it just smells like a stock old lady perfume.</li>
      <li>I actually had a young lady follow me through a store to ask what fragrance I was wearing.  </li>

    <li> This is one of my go to perfumes and it always gets compliments. People would be shocked to know it&#x27;s a celebrity perfume at a reasonable price that smell really good.</li>
    <li> My mom wears Believe by Britney Spears, and after her small sample ran out, I knew what to get her for Christmas. I am very hesitant to buy things online, especially from a website I&#x27;ve never heard of, that&#x27;s an outside purchase of Amazon. I received this yesterday, and before I wrapped it up, I wanted to check to see if it was actually it after I read a review that they didn&#x27;t send the correct item. It was correct. They also added a sample of face cream and another perfume, along with some discounts of future purchases. While that doesn&#x27;t seem like much, I was blown away. I would buy from this company again and again.</li>
    <li> Not only does it smell peppery and spicy, exactly how I remembered, it arrived at my house within 3 days!! Talk about a happy customer.</li>

    <li> Wife loves it and so do i...</li>
    <li> Smells so good, the bottle is huge!  Good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Product was as described. *****</li>
    <li> If you like the other scents like Circus, Fantasy and Radiance, this is a far cry from those. This scent if very woody/musty. Not as sweet as the other scents.</li>
    <li> I might not love Britney, but I do love her perfumes! Every single one smells amazing and I always get compliments wearing them. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Britney Spears.  I loved her since the day she came out and thats why I bought this perfume.  The fragrance notes don&#x27;t seem to match with the smell of the perfume but it still smells good. It&#x27;s my first time smelling it. I would definantly wear this perfume.</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume.  Wore Angel for years and got a little tired of it and then one day found this stuff (this perfume is soooo much cheaper too, win-win!)!  This perfume smells so good.  I have gotten so many compliments from people.  I like that it lasts too.  It doesn&#x27;t fade away quick like some other perfumes out there.  I highly recommend it to anyone woman who wants to smell good!  I also have the Body Souffle, it&#x27;s the lotion which I love too!  I&#x27;ll be wearing this perfume for years to come!  Thanks Britney!  : )</li>
    <li> This parfum is exceptional! I love it.  Just a few sprays and you are nice and clean smelling all day.  I actually had a young lady follow me through a store to ask what fragrance I was wearing.

    <li> Good quality . Perfect condition</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents. The bottle was bigger then I expected, I love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t find it locally</li>
    <li> Gift - my daughter was beyond pleased</li>
    <li> Believe is the  best smelling perfume by Britney Spears.  This is the three bottle I&#x27;ve gotten my wife.  She loves it too.  You can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> I only ordered two 3.4 oz bottles but instead I got them with the body souffle for each bottle! &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;Wow, thank you Amazon. Definitely apply the body souffle if you have dry skin and then spray the perfume, it&#x27;ll make it last longer! I love it and highly recommend it. Notes include Guava, sweet Praline, Amber and fresh Patchouli :) Definitely a Patchouli for beginners, it&#x27;s lovely, long lasting and projects really well.</li>
