      <li>I honestly love make up forever or anastasia banana powder</li>
      <li>this is ok.</li>
      <li>In love.</li>
      <li>I chose this here product because is one of my favorite, there&#x27;s nothing that I don&#x27;t like about this here product..</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my daughter because she needed a setting powder with yellow tones, and this fits is perfect.</li>
      <li>Love it, leaves under my eyes creaseless</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE THIS powder.</li>
      <li>It is better than any setting powder out there on the market.</li>
      <li>and I am glad I listen</li>
      <li>I love this powder.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin so smooth, amazing for highlight.</li>
      <li>Was Very excited about this product.</li>
      <li>Took my high light to another level... its light weight and gives me a great finish</li>
      <li>Shipping was also very quick.</li>
      <li>It really smells good and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>but those with more pink (fair skin) I suggest the Rose Pedal color.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a setting powder that didn&#x27;t accentuate fine lines.</li>
      <li>Really fine.</li>
      <li>Plus all you need is a little bit for the perfect highlight and contour.</li>
      <li>Even as a very dark skinned woman it goes on a d blends perfectly to my skin tone.</li>
      <li>Overall great product, I would purchase it again.</li>
      <li>I sometimes put a really light amount all over my face.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to try this out.</li>
      <li>There is so much that I love this product that already bought the colorless one to set my foundation.</li>
      <li>But other than that its a really great product which is why I gave 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Heard great things about it the actual (Real) product.  </li>
      <li>Pretty sure this is NOT THE REAL THING.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still pretty much full</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so satisfied with this powder already bought two so far in the picture</li>
      <li>Keeps my makeup put on those super hot humid days.</li>
      <li>It is good for under eye highlighting but it breaks me out when used in other areas.</li>
      <li>I have tan/olive skin, acne prone, sensitive skin, so a lot of the acne medications and washes makes my skin really red, the yellow undertone really cancels out the redness, looks great in sunlight and photo light.</li>
      <li>Would love for Anastasia to make her banana powder as a stand alone product rather than in the big palatte (6 pans?)</li>
      <li>I put it on top of yellow corrective creme...</li>
      <li>She showed us a few pictures of using this to her millions of followers, now those millions of followers went out and bought this and ranted and raved how good this stuff is.</li>
      <li>a little yellow for someone fair to light with no olive tones.</li>
      <li>Ready to take pictures and ready for TV!  </li>
      <li>I really like this product and the finish</li>
      <li>This product is really a brightener not a whitener.  </li>
      <li>Camerareadycosmetics.com has the real stuff.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t blend into my skin very well.</li>
      <li>this wants the read deal</li>
      <li>is all I really need.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product 2 any1 who wants their concealer 2 stay in place</li>
      <li>Works better than I expected!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the actual Ben nye, whoever made this did do the label right.</li>
      <li>i expected it to look pretty light but its definitely yellow like a banana.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without now</li>
      <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PURCHASE....</li>
      <li>I can live without this Banana powder.</li>
      <li>It comes out really yellow at first but after spray fix plus by MAC and blending and when it sets it look so natural not cake.</li>
      <li>I wish the manufacturer would put it in pressed powder form in a large, flat pan</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works better than I expected! Will definitely buy again. Color blends well with my skin! I do feel I have to apply more than some powders.</li>
    <li> I saw this powder used on YouTube with several women. It really smells good and goes on smoothly. I will be using it more often for setting concealer.</li>
    <li> This product is really a brightener not a whitener.  I love it!  Now I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PURCHASE....</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve been duped by the Kardashian marketing machine. I bought this powder because Kim Kardashian has the same skin tone as me: olive skin tone with dark under eyes. So I thought, let me do what she&#x27;s supposedly doing. I followed all the techniques: bought the powder, bought the sponge, bought the fan brush. I was excited to try this out. When I applied the powder I allowed for it to set in for 5 minutes. I even put alot on, just like some tutorials show you to do. I put it on top of yellow corrective creme...yellow corrective creme + yellow corrective setting powder &#x3D; how could I go wrong? It doesn&#x27;t fully camouflage my dark under eyes. They can still be seen. On top of this, this powder is horribly wasteful. I have to tap out a pile of it on top of a tissue so then I can use my sponge on it to apply to my under eyes. I end up throwing away unused powder on that tissue. I feel duped because it doesn&#x27;t cover up my under eye circles well enough. The same job this powder gives me, is also given to me by using yellow corrective creme + regular face powder.... I end up putting regular face powder over this banana powder anyway. Thus, my under eyes eventually look cakey. I can live without this Banana powder. I feel as though I&#x27;ve been duped by the Kardashian marketing gimmick. She showed us a few pictures of using this to her millions of followers, now those millions of followers went out and bought this and ranted and raved how good this stuff is. I wonder if she got a cut of profit from the Ben Nye makeup people.</li>
    <li> The product works like Magic. A bit messy with application, so be careful. Overall great product, I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Was Very excited about this product. Shipping was half the price of the item :/. But seeing numerous YouTube videos made me get it. It&#x27;s messy but I&#x27;m no fan of loose powder anyway. I suggest pack it on thick , let sit for awhile then brush off. I barely use this unless a major event or I feel like using  it. Good product though.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but expected more in regards to covering dark circles. It does brighten up your face, which is nice.</li>
    <li> I have tan/olive skin, acne prone, sensitive skin, so a lot of the acne medications and washes makes my skin really red, the yellow undertone really cancels out the redness, looks great in sunlight and photo light. I found applying it with a brush in a stippling  pattern and not wedge, spraying fix plus, and then buffing it out works best. It comes out really yellow at first but after spray fix plus by MAC and blending and when it sets it look so natural not cake.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this powder. Even as a very dark skinned woman it goes on a d blends perfectly to my skin tone.</li>
    <li> It is quite small, however if used in moderation, can last a long time. Plus all you need is a little bit for the perfect highlight and contour. Shipping was also very quick.</li>
    <li> Awesome product but I would definitely recommend this to darker skin tones as I think I may have had to go a little lighter for a true highlighting effect as the product advertises. Nevertheless, awesome airbrush finish to my face!</li>
    <li> This a great product very smooth on the skin</li>
    <li> A little goes a loooooong way! I ordered the smallest size and uses it everyday but I don&#x27;t Ithink I will have to order a new one in few months cause I havent even finish 1/4 iof it yet. A little application can go noticeable.</li>
    <li> So glad I have this product. Keeps my makeup put on those super hot humid days. I only needed to reapply once all day. Love it because you know what it&#x27;s like when you&#x27;re perspiring and your mascara and liner bleed.</li>
    <li> not sure if this is the real deal but, it creases on my skin and i&#x27;ve never had that problem with other setting powders. Also, it depends on your skin tone bc i used it on my sister and her under eyes looked green bc of her concealer color which is a NC20 in MAC. I honestly love make up forever or anastasia banana powder</li>
    <li> this is ok. a little yellow for someone fair to light with no olive tones. i dont see what the hype is all about. i wont buy it again</li>
    <li> Love this face powder!  Pores disappears and makes your skin look smoother and younger. Apply over your make up!</li>
    <li> This is the best powder EVER!!  It leaves you with a smooth, flawless finish.  Ready to take pictures and ready for TV!  I also use the Topaz powder, but since using this I have not touched the Topaz in weeks. I will always use this powder.  It is better than any setting powder out there on the market.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the actual Ben nye, whoever made this did do the label right. I never used the Ben nye powder so I can&#x27;t compare the actual powders, but kinda just looks/ feels like yellow flour I&#x27;ve had it for like a year now (yes this a very later review)  and it&#x27;s still pretty much full</li>
    <li> I love this powder it sets my concealer wonderfully&#x3D;-) I recommend this product 2 any1 who wants their concealer 2 stay in place</li>
    <li> This power really light up your face in a good way...looks awesome someone told me about this power and I am glad I listen</li>
    <li> The very excellent deal and I am pleased to deal with you again, and I will recommend my friends to this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE THIS powder.</li>
    <li> In love. Authentic! Was scared this wants the read deal but it is and it&#x27;s lovely. Really fine. Perfect for medium tones (yellow) undertones (I&#x27;m an NC42-44) from mac LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love this product! Took my high light to another level... its light weight and gives me a great finish</li>
    <li> the Ben Nye Banana powder is awesome for setting my concealer.  I am not big on makeup but doing the concealer and the powder to set it is all I really need.  I sometimes put a really light amount all over my face.  It&#x27;s just enough!!!  A little goes a really really long way!</li>
    <li> Received this items as described. Works great to highlight under the eyes and anywhere else you want to highlight on your face. A little goes a long way and I see this bottle lasting a very long time even if using on a daily basis. I really like this product and the finish gives me a fresh/awake look even on tired mornings.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a glamorous glow! Great for caramel skin tone. Can be mixed with other Ben Nye Translucent Powders such as Topaz for my chocolate divas too!</li>
    <li> It is good for under eye highlighting but it breaks me out when used in other areas.</li>
    <li> I love this powder does a great job on highlights &amp; contour makeup artist dreams. Great glow with concealer under eyes</li>
    <li> Im in love! This setting powder is great and it gives your undereye that glow that I love. It sets the concealer and I haven&#x27;t seen any creasing. My face looks smooth and flawless.</li>
    <li> I wanted a setting powder that didn&#x27;t accentuate fine lines. This powder is finely milled; a good find. I wish the manufacturer would put it in pressed powder form in a large, flat pan so it doesn&#x27;t go flying everywhere and you can use a big brush. I could try to put it in an empty compact with alcohol but not sure that will work. I have yellow undertones (I&#x27;m tan/brown and I use NC30 concealer from mac with this) but those with more pink (fair skin) I suggest the Rose Pedal color.  Would love for Anastasia to make her banana powder as a stand alone product rather than in the big palatte (6 pans?) that I would probably only use two products and waste the others that I would have paid a lot of money for.  Sigh...maybe in addition to this one I&#x27;ll try the becca banana powder???  For now though, this does the trick for my brown complexion.</li>
    <li> I love this powder. On thing I didn&#x27;t like was after I purchased this 1.5oz bottle for $22 I found a website that only charges $10 for a 3oz bottle. But other than that its a really great product which is why I gave 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend into my skin very well. Kind of makes me look ill.</li>
    <li> It came in a timely manner. Unfortunately two days later I found you can get the much bigger size for half of what I paid for this. But oh well I&#x27;m just happy I have my Ben nye : )</li>
    <li> This powder is like magic in a bottle. Love it. Leaves my skin so smooth, amazing for highlight. There is so much that I love this product that already bought the colorless one to set my foundation. Does amazing job with myoily skin becuase after 8 hours no shine :)</li>
    <li> I guess because I&#x27;m really not sure if I&#x27;m using it correctly. But it&#x27;s a nice product, I just didn&#x27;t get the results I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I chose this here product because is one of my favorite, there&#x27;s nothing that I don&#x27;t like about this here product..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so satisfied with this powder already bought two so far in the picture it looks so small but its actually a good size and it lasts forever it gives you a glowing Finnish</li>
    <li> Very beautiful... I can&#x27;t live without now&lt;br /&gt;It makes my makeup look amazing !!!</li>
    <li> i just received it and used it once , i haven&#x27;t used powder before but i might buy it again.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this is NOT THE REAL THING. Highly disappointed. Heard great things about it the actual (Real) product.  Different packaging, terrible coverage, didn&#x27;t stay on my skin and color was terrible from whatsoever did stay on. Looked nothing like &amp;#34;Kim kardashian&#x27;s highlighting powder&amp;#34;. Do not buy this from here. Camerareadycosmetics.com has the real stuff.</li>
    <li> pretty dark color i expected it to look pretty light but its definitely yellow like a banana. its alright. Nothing great</li>
    <li> Shipped within 3-5 days. I like the product, but I cannot use it alone. It helps with my redness but it&#x27;s very light so I have to use it with concealer too.good buy though!</li>
    <li> Love it, leaves under my eyes creaseless</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter because she needed a setting powder with yellow tones, and this fits is perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright but I don&#x27;t get the hype.</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve been using this same one for about 2years now! It lasts so long and it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Broke my skin out!!!! Will not use again!!</li>
