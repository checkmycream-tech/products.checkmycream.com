      <li>I think this is a good product</li>
      <li>Seems like good eyeliner liquid itself though.</li>

      <li>Great find for what I was use to that was no longer available.  </li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be amazing.  </li>
      <li>Two stars because it is a nice color.</li>
      <li>Nice buy for the price.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t love it-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay-</li>
      <li>I was expecting this applicator was like a brush you dip into the liquid, but its more like a felt tip pen.</li>
      <li>Nice smooth lines.</li>
      <li>Love this liner.....</li>
      <li>its amazing it glides so smoothly on your eyes</li>
      <li>Besides - they say you shouldn&#x27;t use eye makeup for more that 6 months and</li>
      <li>I would have liked a larger amount of liner but the price was great for the amount.</li>
      <li>The liner has a nice felt-tipped pen style applicator which can be used for a fine line or a bold one.</li>
      <li>I frequent, so I&#x27;m glad I can get it through Amazon!!</li>
      <li>Lasts all day and easy to remove with cleanser.</li>
      <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge huge fan of this product and recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>but it was also really cheap-</li>
      <li>Prestige eyeliner went on smoothly, and lasted all day for her.</li>
      <li>The wand is easy to hold and just the right length in your hand.</li>
      <li>I have used this line for eight plus years and absolutely 100% love it.</li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>Not bad at all for a budget eyeliner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this eyeliner for more than 5 years and love it it last all day</li>
      <li>It dries up fast and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
      <li>The liquid itself is smooth and not thick, but dries fairly quick -</li>
      <li>I can never get felt tips to apply right on my eyes</li>
      <li>I apply it to my top corner lid and thankfully it hasn&#x27;t actually gotten into my eyes, but for some reason</li>
      <li>I was expecting it to last better</li>
      <li>Only issue is that it smears easily and that the tip eventually looses it&#x27;s point.</li>
      <li>Both work equally well, it only takes a little practice to get it perfect.  </li>
      <li>it really stings.</li>
      <li>This particular color is nice when it&#x27;s freshly applied but over the course of the day the brown color  fades to red, giving one the appearance of pink eye.</li>
      <li>I love this product in black though.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s great if black is too dark for you.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry quickly so it sometimes leaves a streak on my lids.</li>
      <li>but I find this product extremely easy to wear, and a fun new addition to a tired old face!</li>
      <li>I only wish they made waterproof - then my life would be complete ;)</li>
      <li>My sensitive eyes has had no reaction.</li>
      <li>This is a nice dark shade between black and brown</li>
      <li>you want a dramatic cat eye look, or just a lightly lined more casual daytime look, this liner does a fantastic job and stays on!</li>
      <li>Very easy thin brush for application.  </li>
      <li>The line is really fine and the brush is stiff enough for you to feel like you have control over the application.  </li>
      <li>I bought a dark brown, but I think black would be better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had other colors for a few years and they&#x27;re still just fine.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was expecting an eyeliner that would wear off as the day progressed and found that this eyeliner stays put.  Nice buy for the price.</li>
    <li> My eyes watered the two times I applied this eyeliner. I blotted off the smeared eyeliner only to discover the product was in my eye. I rolled up a small piece of tissue to gently blot it out of my eye. Never have had a problem with any other eyeliner irritating my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have used this line for eight plus years and absolutely 100% love it. The liner has a nice felt-tipped pen style applicator which can be used for a fine line or a bold one. The wand is easy to hold and just the right length in your hand. The liquid stays put all day, but washes off with ease with water. (If you&#x27;re a crier, don&#x27;t wear this.)  The color is lighter than black, but still dark. The liquid itself is smooth and not thick, but dries fairly quick - so when applying you will have to dip the felt tip into the liquid pot a few times - if you apply slowly like me.&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge huge fan of this product and recommend to anyone. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I like the color and the shape of the applicator, however, this stuff BURNS. I apply it to my top corner lid and thankfully it hasn&#x27;t actually gotten into my eyes, but for some reason, ouch... it really stings. Would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay- I don&#x27;t hate it, I don&#x27;t love it- but it was also really cheap- so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be amazing.  The line is really fine and the brush is stiff enough for you to feel like you have control over the application.  I had to dip it in the liquid several times since it didn&#x27;t seem like a ton of eyeliner actually was on the brush- and I don&#x27;t wear a lot of eyeliner.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before, so knew I was getting a good product.  I couldn&#x27;t find it elsewhere anymore, so figured I would try Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all for a budget eyeliner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at the low price and purchased this for my daughter to try out. She is an expert at drawing beautiful cat eyes with liquid liner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Prestige eyeliner went on smoothly, and lasted all day for her. In my opinion and in hers, it is comparable to more expensive brands, yet does the job for much less money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;whether you want a dramatic cat eye look, or just a lightly lined more casual daytime look, this liner does a fantastic job and stays on!</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner! I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Stays put all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge or make your eyes sting like others.</li>
    <li> Very easy thin brush for application.  Not easy to find brown/black. I would have liked a larger amount of liner but the price was great for the amount. Besides - they say you shouldn&#x27;t use eye makeup for more that 6 months and that is about what is in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I recommend this. It dries up fast and easy to apply. I bought a dark brown, but I think black would be better.</li>
    <li> Looks red on eyes. When eyes water, it looks like they are bleeding.</li>
    <li> I use a little dab, then blend it using an eye pencil- it takes less product and does some of the smudging for me.</li>
    <li> This particular color is nice when it&#x27;s freshly applied but over the course of the day the brown color  fades to red, giving one the appearance of pink eye. I love this product in black though.</li>
    <li> This is a nice dark shade between black and brown that&#x27;s great if black is too dark for you.  The liner itself has a narrow tip and it&#x27;s possible to get any effect you&#x27;d like with it.  Sometimes I draw a very thin line and sometimes I go bolder.  Both work equally well, it only takes a little practice to get it perfect.  This eyeliner doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly.  I&#x27;ve had other colors for a few years and they&#x27;re still just fine.  This liner also wears well and doesn&#x27;t flake off.  It&#x27;s especially flattering, if you&#x27;re going for a nude look, to work the tip into the base of the lashes rather than drawing a line.  This adds depth to the eyelashes and makes them look thicker without looking like makeup.  Just FYI.  I think this is a good product and if you can&#x27;t find Prestige at your local drug store, then get it from Amazon.  It&#x27;s worth the price.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> its amazing it glides so smoothly on your eyes</li>
    <li> I use this eyeliner for more than 5 years and love it it last all day</li>
    <li> LOVE this eyeliner! The application tip is perfect for attaining the most precise cat eye look. I&#x27;ve already got 3 friends hooked on this eyeliner since I started using it. I only wish they made waterproof - then my life would be complete ;)</li>
    <li> I put a line of shadow or Prestige pencil underneath then use this for the fine areas requiring perfect appearance, together they&#x27;re my favourite duo, nothing better!</li>
    <li> Does not flow on evenly.  Cakes.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used liquid eyeliner before, and I&#x27;m over 50 -- but I find this product extremely easy to wear, and a fun new addition to a tired old face!</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to last better</li>
    <li> Love this liner.....Only issue is that it smears easily and that the tip eventually looses it&#x27;s point.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth lines. Just wish the brush was flexible instead of hard.</li>
    <li> Great find for what I was use to that was no longer available.  My sensitive eyes has had no reaction. Stays on for the day also.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this applicator was like a brush you dip into the liquid, but its more like a felt tip pen. I can never get felt tips to apply right on my eyes so i probably wont be using this u less i can find a brush to apply it. Seems like good eyeliner liquid itself though.</li>
    <li> Two stars because it is a nice color. The product is too thick. Before I apply it, I have to dab it on a tissue to tone it down. it doesn&#x27;t dry quickly so it sometimes leaves a streak on my lids. I just tossed it like I do all my other make-up mistakes and try again with a different product.</li>
    <li> Like this brand in particular because the applicator tip is firm. The &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; types are not as forgiving and I end up with a crooked line, not flattering. Lasts all day and easy to remove with cleanser.</li>
    <li> I only like to use Prestige liquid eyeliner.  They no longer sell it at the drug stores I frequent, so I&#x27;m glad I can get it through Amazon!! The application tip is great and sturdy and applies the eyeliner whichever way I desire.</li>
