<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Hello, all. This is an great wig. The other Reviewer, The Random Otaku is my friend and she is completely right about this wig. We both fell in love with this one by the picture and ended up purchasing it. I ordered mine on June 1st. And got it yesterday on the 11th. The delivery estimate was from the 26th to July 15th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As The Random Otaku said, the wig has some red in it, which is a very pleasant surprise. The darker somewhat teal color is much brighter in person and goes well with the gray/black color of the wig. I had tried styling it into a side ponytail which worked very well, it didn&#x27;t disrupt the curls or anything. I hope to try braiding it sometime like it is in the pictures. The fibers are very soft and of a high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completely love this wig and recommend it to anyone who likes it by the pictures. I wore it all evening yesterday and it didn&#x27;t even frizz-up that much. Just a couple of stray hairs here and there. I own three other wigs. Which all get frizzy each time I wear them. Also, when I wore this wig I didn&#x27;t feel that hot at all. (Like I usually do in my other wigs.) It breathes very well. It is simply soft and wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to getting the wig, I got the little black hair net and a free sticker! The sticker was so cute, it had a little teddy bear and a ducky on it, as well as some writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps those who are looking at this wig. It is fabulous, and I recommend it to any and all wig lovers. And I can&#x27;t wait to buy from this seller again, they were simply wonderful with their service. I am a happy costumer that will come again, lol.</li>
    <li> not exactly how I thought it&#x27;d look. it&#x27;s more of a weird mix of colors. looks nice but makes it hard to find outfits that don&#x27;t make it look weird. decent quality.</li>
    <li> I love it so much. it&#x27;s soft and silky so it feels like real hair. I love the blending of the colors and the way it curls. Even my stylist friend thought it was my real hair.</li>
    <li> I tried it on as soon as I got it. It&#x27;s very confertable and a beautiful color!  Moving the bangs around took a bit but once you style them right, it&#x27;s a great wig!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay wig. I thought it was gonna be black and green on the ends. It came as auburn hair with green ALL OVER. I am overall just disappointed that it was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Wig came fast and well packaged and also came with a black wig net. The color, style and length look just like the pictures and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. This wig is definitely a steel/charcoal gray with teal ends. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it and I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> I was a bit iffy when purchasing this wig, simply for the price, but the reviews were good and I&#x27;m not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great wig! It&#x27;s very full. The colors are beautiful (the green a bit brighter than pictured and the gray a bit darker)! It&#x27;s got lovely curls to it that more or less retain their shape through brushes. It&#x27;s easy to use and adjust. The wig cap isn&#x27;t easily seen when it falls naturally. And it looks fantastic! Also, it doesn&#x27;t frizz or tangle much at all (unless you get crazy) and is typically easy to maintain. Took a bit to get here but it did travel pretty far and on standard shipping so I&#x27;m not going to complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t wear it day-to-day in public because it does have a bit of a synthetic look to it, but it would be GREAT for cosplay. It&#x27;s very, very pretty and I still am quite stunned at the quality given the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that I have a large head and while I can get the wig on, its typically too tight and stretched to the point you can see the cap. My younger sister, however, is of average proportions and it fits her like a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s great. Fantastic price. Good quality.</li>
    <li> This wig looks great in the picture. I would think I would have  gotten a mostly dark greyish color with dark green tips and ends. Nope - the wig is brown and blue - all the way through - no green or gray in it at all. Be careful - when they say the color will differ from the picture - they mean it big time!!!!</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful and I wear it all the time.It is beautifully made.The shipping was great,it got here right when it said it would.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to a mainly gray wig with green here and there. Unfortunately, it is mostly blue-green, and only looks gray in low lighting. It&#x27;s a pretty decent wig for the price, however. It is soft, long, and the slight curls are really easy to keep nice looking, merely coil the length up and shake it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty unimpressed with the color, though. It&#x27;s definitely more blue-green than anything, which is not at all what I was looking for. Only one of the buyer submitted photos looks at all close to the color my wig turned out, so perhaps I got a fluke, and others will have better luck with their colors [or just want a mainly blue-green wig... haha].</li>
    <li> First of all, I got this item 2 weeks after I ordered it which is awesome considering that Amazon guesstimated about 1-1 1/2 months. The wig itself is amazing. It is my favorite, hands down. The curls hold amazingly and it rarely tangles. Super soft and thick. It has an edgy punk look to it which is perfect for wearing with a band t-shirt. The only thing I didn&#x27;t expect was the reddish streaks it has in it. If you look closely it&#x27;s got light red strands. Other than that, I love this wig.</li>
    <li> Wow! This wig is so much fun and looks great on. I highly recommend it. I love it so much!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this wig I thought it was just black and green however once it arrived also had burgundy in it, which I thought was an added bonus. The wig also came with like a fishnet or mesh style wig cap. The wig has an adjustable cap on the inside so it can fit to most head sizes and I happen to have a small head so it was perfect i was able to adjust it.The wig also arrived in about two weeks after i bought it even though it estimated about two months.The product was so perfect and since the price went down from when I first purchased it so I bought another one and I would gladly buy a third but I do not need a third one and that would be excessive however i would absolutely buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> This is my favourite wig out of my hole collection. There&#x27;s more teal in it than you would expect but its still so pretty and super soft too!</li>
    <li> Unlike other reviewers, I&#x27;m not happy with the details that weren&#x27;t advertised such as the red/maroon strands in the wig. I&#x27;m not pleased with the fact that it&#x27;s more of a light greyish-pinkish-purple than it is the black that it is advertised as. I didn&#x27;t want a grey wig, I wanted a black wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came as a grey plastic sealed bag, there was no order invoice. The wig had come out of the plastic ziplock bag it was in and had come undone from the little hairnet thing it was inside of, so there were tangles in the hair that caused a lot of shedding when I had to detangle the wig. There is a short fringe of hair underneath the bangs that shows when I try to style the bangs to the side. And one of the size adjuster hooks just wasn&#x27;t there, I only have the left side one operational.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very disappointed. I&#x27;m not even going to bother getting a refund, I&#x27;m just going to use this for fake dread making practice.</li>
    <li> I honestly was surprised with how fast this wig arrived. It arrived just a week after I ordered it and you wouldn&#x27;t believe how happy I was. I love how soft the wig is and it&#x27;s extremely comfortable to wear. I know this because I wore it today while at the mall. The curls get tangled easily, but that&#x27;s bound to happen. I mean it is a wig. The wig doesn&#x27;t look exactly like it does in the picture. It doesn&#x27;t have an obvious gradient like in the picture, instead the wig looks almost teal, but if you look hard enough you do notice that it&#x27;s more teal at the tips like in the picture. The gray color at some points do look kind of brownish and seems a little more dark, but even after all this talk about the color, I honestly still like it. I really don&#x27;t mind the color. I actually prefer the wig like this.&lt;br /&gt;Now the reason this wig didn&#x27;t get a 5 star rating was because when I was trying it on to see how the wig felt and whatnot I was rubbing my hands through the wig fibers and I noticed that at the top (the roots) the fibers felt really weird as if they were glued together (I honestly don&#x27;t know how to explain this OTL). I took the wig off to examine it and I found that some fibers looked like they had been burnt. It&#x27;s small and really hard to notice, so it&#x27;s not too much of a problem, but I did find little areas of burnt fibers throughout the wig, not just near the wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s really the only thing that bothered me about the wig, but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with the wig! I can&#x27;t wait to show it off to more people!</li>
    <li> Its not black and teal. More like gray and teal. At least it&#x27;s definitely teal. I can understand if they were trying to make it look more real. No one has truly natural black hair. As much as I want to, I can&#x27;t say I like it. :( I can at least say it feels... nice? I haven&#x27;t worn it long enough to be sure. I have bought other wigs cheaper that look better, sold by X&amp;Y if you want something affordable and nice. Good luck!</li>
    <li> The wig looks and feels real but it tangles way to easily which makes it unwearable.A LOT of the hair as fallen out and you can&#x27;t brush it without clumps of hair coming out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS WIG! I thought I&#x27;d be getting a grey wig with teal tips but it&#x27;s actually homogenized teal, grey, and a little brown. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it cuz everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair. It&#x27;s truly beautiful, my favorite wig of all time, but you should know it looks SUPER different from the pictures posted.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for, especially when it comes to wigs. I was looking for something that I could wear every once in a while to change things up but I couldn&#x27;t justify spending a lot of money on something that wasn&#x27;t going to be used very often. This wig fits my needs perfectly. The color is awesome, there is a little more red than you see in the picture which makes it even prettier. If you want something to wear everyday I would recommend going with something else, something with real hair that cost significantly more. But if you just like to change your look occasionally, dress up or need it for a halloween costume than it&#x27;s perfect for you.</li>
    <li> it was good wig but the coloring is different i was getting this for my niece and we thought it had green tips but it is mostly green</li>
    <li> This is a very cute wig at a very good price, just not on me!  It was cheap, though, so I&#x27;ll keep it around for fun.</li>
    <li> I love this wig, but the loss of a star reflects the hair color not matching the photo.  It appears as if it was &amp;#34;inspired&amp;#34; by the photo.  The turquoise portion is mixed throughout the entire wig, with wefts of pure turquoise hair placed inferiorly on wig to simulate the turquoise ends.  Regardless, in terms of quality, it is very good. The hair is very soft, easy to manage and style with minimal shedding. It is extremely cute and weirdly, I am not disappointed.  Shipping did take about 1 month, but I got it in time for Halloween and within the shipping time frame.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, despite it being a little different, (but awesomely different) it beyond exceeded my expectations as I was not expecting much.  I usually order much more expensive wigs from non-Amazon sites.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I noticed that there are many different vendors for this wig. I&#x27;d order again from my vendor, but I cannot speak to the quality of other vendors.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this wig. It looks exactly as it does in the photo. Easy to style and comfortable to wear. I have received a lot of compliments on it as well. If you&#x27;re thinking about ordering it do it...definitely do it. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Just Beautiful. It came on time and was packaged nicely. The quality is AMAZING and the length is perfect. It tangles easily, but not to the extent of the wig being ruined. But overall, its a beautiful wig, the color makes it unique as well as the style.</li>
    <li> This wig is awesome although the green parts are way darker than shown in the picture, you can only really see it under light.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome wig!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very thick and full feeling, the curls came intact and have a lot of bounce to them! Extremely soft and silky feel to it, Can not see the wig cap at all. The color was in fact very interesting, there is a red hue in some of the hair, but nothing to distracting. It enhances the color actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length is also quite surprising. I stand about 5&#x27; 5&amp;#34;, but it reaches my mid back, slightly longer if you pull/stretch the curls out. The bangs are quite long as well, touching my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It untangles quite easily as well, a simple run through with your fingers should rid of any knots, after every use. Doesn&#x27;t shed to much, practice wore it for an hour, and only had a single strand from the bangs come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t think of any criticisms. But bases on personal preference, you may want to trim or style the bangs, because they fall in your face quite easily, but I prefer the feel/ don&#x27;t mind it at all. c:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly will buy from in the future.</li>
    <li> The black color to this wig looked horrible. It had the teal color running everywhere in it in lines. I will no be buying any other wigs from here.</li>
    <li> When my mom got this for me for my birthday i was so excited! Once i got it i sprang to try it on. The quality is phenomenal, its strong, full, easy to clean, fits right and its just absolutely beautiful! i can&#x27;t wait to wear it for the next up coming con and I cant recommend this wig  more!</li>
    <li> I got my wig in the mail today, so I thought I would write a review. I love this wig, but the reason I give it only four stars was the color. I had seen some reviews that said it was gray with teal, and the title says green and black, and some other reviews say that they got a mix of teal and a reddish color. I got the reddish and teal one. I really wanted the grayish color, which is kind of there, but that would be my only negative thing about this wig. The wig itself is a lot fuller than I expected, which was a great surprise. The styling is nice. I love the bangs. It looks good on both sides or styled to one side. The teal ends are super pretty. The hair itself is a lot nicer than that of other wigs I have gotten off amazon. Overall I think it was a great wig especially for such a cheap price. I will probably be buying more wigs from this seller.</li>
    <li> The picture and name suggest a black to green coloring what i got was no where near that its silver red and green.</li>
    <li> very full, comfortable, attractive wig. I&#x27;ve worn it dancing and other that very small amounts of heat discomfort, this wig performed remarkably. The green color is a little more teal than green and the black is actually dark grey and red. However, I must note that the grey/red color looks much more like black and much better than black would against the green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light wash and powder made this wig a beautiful addition to my wardrobe.</li>
    <li> its so soft and beautiful :) I love how cute it is and fits really well on me.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more</li>
    <li> This is my first Kanekalon fiber wig, and it far surpassed my expectations. The wig feels a lot like human hair and it&#x27;s really easy to brush. Since the fiber is a high-quality synthetic, I&#x27;m able to curl and straighten the wig without melting it. The length is really good and it&#x27;s the fullest synthetic wig I think I have ever owned. Just as a personal choice, I&#x27;m considering buying clip-in extensions to make it just a bit fuller and to add a little more color. All in all, I&#x27;m in love with this wig.</li>
    <li> I had originally wanted it for cosplay but it&#x27;s so cute and it looks like natural hair just dyed! It&#x27;s so lovely &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It is soft and feels nice. I can wear it all day and be fine. It was a brighter green than I thought it was and the green is not just the tips it is thru the wig. It looks great though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a wig themed bachelorette party, and for the sale price of $12 with free shipping it was well worth the price!  I received many compliments.</li>
    <li> Really well made, and super shiny and pretty however the color was different than what was explained. Instead of it being black with green tips it was more of a greenish grey with green tips and sadly, that coloring didn&#x27;t work well with my skin tone so I had to send it back.</li>
    <li> The color in the photo looks gray and green, right? It&#x27;s very pinkish in real life, making it a very interesting sight.</li>
    <li> In the photo the gray part looks more like a dark charcoal... when you actually get it there are strands of maroon and its a light gray color.  It is a very good quality wig, just not the color in the photo.....</li>
    <li> Definitely not a black to green gradient. it&#x27;s actually grey with green and brown pieces throughout. Still pretty cool though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so pretty! A bit longer than it looks, and a LOT of the jade color, it&#x27;s more with the brown than grey, but it looks the same! Nice curls, wavy after and straight on top, it hasn&#x27;t tangled yet, so that&#x27;s good, and it looks very very nice! Came early too! And the people who sold it to me gave me a speedy response when I had a question or concern!</li>
    <li> This wig was purchased for my daughter and she is so happy. Its very soft and natural. She wears it all the time.</li>
    <li> Not really what I expected the wig is just gray and green and just kind of a mess</li>
    <li> this is a gorgeous wig with the perfect amount of hair. The color is so cute. The only problems are shedding, tangeling, and it loses it&#x27;s curls. I tried to brush this wig out using proper materials that I have used before and it didn&#x27;t really work. e</li>
    <li> This wig is NOT black and green, it is red and green. It&#x27;s very thick except for the bangs. Shipping took a while as it is coming from china. Still a pretty wig for the price.</li>
    <li> This wig is gorgeous and amazing.  However, it is not anything near &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; as the description states.  It is a very dark red, a red that is almost black.  On closer inspection it is absolutely red.  The green is a beautiful color, down to a vibrant turquoise in some places.  The wig is soft and feels pretty natural.  If only my real hair was this lustrous and bouncy!  I have seen wigs that cost three times this in costume shops that were not even close to this quality.  It puts those cheap looking things to shame.  It came with a wig cap and netting to keep the wig from becoming too wild.  My real hair is perfectly fine, I wanted to try something with a little color in it, without actually dying my own hair and this fits the bill.  You will be surprised, amazed and overjoyed at such a quality wig at such a low price.</li>
    <li> a little greyer than expected but , still cute . combed through it once then it kinda started shedding though  .</li>
    <li> This is the first wig I&#x27;ve ever worn and I love it. It fits my head really well and the color is great. I thought it was gray and green but when i got it it is gray and turquoise blue with red tones in it. its easy to manage and look very real, even people who know me thought i just dyed my hair :)</li>
    <li> Love it! Its not a black but more of a grey just like in the picture but its still beautiful.</li>
    <li> the base colour of this wig is a deep brown, rather than the black as listed. this was actually a plus for me, as I greatly prefer the brown. the wig itself looks quite natural, like colour streaks were added to your hair. because it&#x27;s a longer wig, the weight of the hair does pull towards the back, so I may be adding a toupee clip to keep it from slipping. otherwise, it&#x27;s very comfortable and fits well.</li>
    <li> Color are different, totally black and green... but still ok, never mind...</li>
    <li> The wig I received is absolutely gorgeous, and it&#x27;s very nice in general, but there is a lot more green/teal in it than picture, which was a slight disappointment. It&#x27;s still a very lovely wig, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the color of black that was mixed into it. It&#x27;s almost a smokey color? It&#x27;s very lovely.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Much lighter than pictured.</li>
    <li> I was ecstatic about this purchase, but the actual color does not match the description. It was more gray and green.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine purchased this wig for me as a gift and this wig is amazing. Sythetic is the cheaper way to go and I am tired of people whp are trying to get other people to buy real hair wigs and giving sythetic a bad name. Yes its higher maitence but the choices amd styles are never ending. I am in love with it and as soon as I get a chance I&#x27;ll do a photoshoot with it :)</li>
    <li> great item. can&#x27;t wait to cosplay</li>
    <li> You have to use a lil fabric softener on the bright green hair it is dry and frizzes but this wig is thick and pretty. Rich colors!</li>
    <li> I love the wig but the colors do not look like the pictures. It&#x27;s more part dark brown/black and part mint green. It also tangled easy for me but detangler fixed it.</li>
    <li> This wig looks beautiful on the mannequin head full stop. It is more gray than anything else and does not look good on me at all. I don&#x27;t even use it. It makes me look old. Ugh! What a waste of money. Sigh! If it was black and green it would be perfect but that greyish colour just totally messed it up.</li>
    <li> I usually prefer to buy my wigs at my go-to shop, but I purchased this one online because I was pressed for time and the reviews and price were right. So glad I did because this is currently one of my favorite wigs! It&#x27;s thick and full and fit perfectly!</li>
    <li> When I open the package, I was expecting something similar to the image but NO IT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. It was all greenish teal with a little bit of gray. I was very disappointed but I still liked the style and I was getting used to the color.&lt;br /&gt;It fits well, the hair is soft and it is good quality so I&#x27;m okay with it now.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this anyone who doesn&#x27;t get to upset with getting something different from what you ordered.</li>
    <li> This product really made me happy. The material was really nice and soft, brushing the wig didn&#x27;t destroy it, and most of all the color and design is really nice. Recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad wig, but it is NOT the wig in the picture. It&#x27;s black and turqoise. NO gradient, NO green.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite wig! The picture doe it no justice! Beautiful emerald gree and the mix of the hair is maroon,grey and teal strands which make it Ash Grey and Diamond green but still, its really beautiful</li>
    <li> The one and only good thing I can say about this wig was that it arrived in one day (using Prime shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issues are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1) Completely wrong color- the wig that arrived is jet black and bright, turquoise blue. No gradient at all, no green tones, no gray or silver tones. Black and blue. (will be posting a photo of this as well)&lt;br /&gt;2) Not wavy or curly, straight. The wig was the wrong style.&lt;br /&gt;3) Shedding! Instant shedding, and TONS of it. While the wig is relatively full, the shedding was absurd. And I only tried it on for about 2 minutes to snap a few photos. Granted the wig was under $10 as an add-on, but I have paid $10 for wigs and received MUCH higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;4) I was UNABLE to RETURN this item until I called Amazon&#x27;s (amazing) Customer Service team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just a fair warning- the wig itself was snug as well. I admittedly have a larger than average head but until the last couple wigs I ordered, have never had any that were too small or even tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So over all, 2 stars for the fact that the wig did actually arrive before expected and it was in fact, a wig... and not the worst wig on the planet. But definitely enough to make me immediately pack it back up to return. But mostly the extra star is for for Amazon&#x27;s amazing customer service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so pretty, and I love the curl! Very nice wig, I am so thoroughly pleased with it.</li>
    <li> First thing, the wig arrived a couple weeks after I ordered it, awesome! As just about a majority of the reviews said, there&#x27;s an odd tint mixed in the wig (I think it&#x27;s a brownish, rather than reddish), however it is not noticeable from afar. It took me a little bit to figure out how to get it to lay right. I bought this as a just because wig or more like an experimental wig. I now know that black is not my strong suit, colorwise, haha. But that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is nice and thick, except I feel like the cap poking out in the back, I&#x27;m not sure if this is a common wig thing cause that happened with a couple other wigs of mine. The green is a DEEP forest green almost, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone for cosplay or maybe for a more casual reason (such as myself). :)</li>
    <li> This is a really cute wig, and not cheap looking like some other wigs for similar prices. The bangs are a bit wonky, though, and because of how the color is distributed they are difficult to cut.</li>
    <li> There was more teal color then the picture and the teal color was all over the will wig making it look kinda like you hair color was grey and you added a hole bunch of teal high lights I was looking for more the picture where it was only teal on the tips and bangs but it was all over the place but it&#x27;s what you get for 10 dollar wig it&#x27;s cute but not for me oh and a plus side of it was it was thick and had lots of hair and you can brush it and not a lot of hair will fall out</li>
    <li> *WARNING*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looks very GRAY in person. I do not suggest buying this, unless you plan on dying it YOURSELF. IT LOOKS LIKE AN OLD GRANNY WIG!!!!</li>
    <li> It looked nothing like the pictures! The green looked more like a light lime color. And the ends weren&#x27;t just dyed the whole under part of the wig was dyed lime! I wasted 2weeks being excited for garbage! I wish I never wasted my money on this...😡</li>
    <li> Looks like my natural hair and all my friends thought it was real! great for winter lolita xoxox great buy</li>
    <li> Not as same as imaging. It touches good. But fake. I think I am not suitable for this. That s all</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig because I love the color and it got such great reviews, but you still never really know what you&#x27;re going to get. I was amazed, it came in great quality and was almost exactly as pictures. It was soft and smooth and didnt tangle or shed as easily as some of my other wigs. The color is really vibrant and it also has red strands throughout that look really cool. I actually wore it while christmas shopping this year and I got alot of compliments on my highlights, lol. It arrived in two weeks after i ordered it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase!</li>
    <li> The wi has more color than in the picture and it&#x27;s longer too!&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it :D my friends say it looks like mermaid hair, no regrets!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it :3</li>
    <li> I love it so soft and looks real, I love how it moves and I actually forgot I was wearing it lol</li>
    <li> At first I was quite skeptical of getting this wig, BUT I&#x27;M SO HAPPY I DID! It&#x27;s very beautiful and very well made, no tracks showing or anything. No fake plastic shine, doesn&#x27;t tangle much and has a natural weight to it. It&#x27;s amazing. As others have said it does have a red/black mix to create the illusion of grey which is awesome! It looks so great the only way people knew it was a wig was because I have short hair! I recommend this to anyone looking for an easy and edgy way to change their look.</li>
    <li> The wig IS Gray and Teal. Not Black or Green. YES the wig has other colors in the gray like red and blue because far away that makes the look gray and it makes up the entire shade. It is NOT false advertising. This wig came with a free wig cap and it came in a little netted wig to hold it together in case you don&#x27;t have a stand at first, like me. This is my first wig, but it is kinda a good one for me to learn with for Comic-Con. I kept messing with this one so I bought another for play use or just because occasions because this wig started to knot up. I didn&#x27;t buy a wig brush, but I just used one of my combs and lightly combed through the knots, being careful not to pull it all out. The wig sheds, but that&#x27;s natural, It looks like real hair in low lighting because it comes off looking like a pale brown/auburn color with green tips and it&#x27;s slightly shiny, but a lil powder solves that. Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my daughter and she absolutely loved it. Great wig for a great price. I definitely recommend to someone who is looking forsomething to have fun with.</li>
    <li> This item is a beautiful wig BUT if you want a black/green wig this one isn&#x27;t for you! It&#x27;s not exactly as described the colors are much different than expected instead of black to green it was gray with vibrant red streaks then green at the bottom. The red streaks are beautiful as well as the green but I was looking for a black wig not gray I will keep it and wear it because it&#x27;s still beautiful but still not what I was expecting. The description should be changed to gray instead of black. :)</li>
    <li> The wig is fine as a costume if you want a teal green wig. The only resemblance to the picture is that the bangs are deeper teal than the rest of the wig which is 95% teal green.</li>
    <li> The wig is very cute, though much more streaked with green than is shown in the pictures. Its a small fitting wig but comfortable enough. I felt so cute the second I put it on and definitely recommend it for fun nights out or photo shoots.</li>
    <li> The colors are not true to the photo, instead of mostly gray with what seems like blue-green frosted tipslike the Picture shows, it&#x27;s gray and blue all over like heavy highlights from the top of the wig all the way down. No gradient. But its pretty nonetheless, was disappointed with the misrepresentation of the coloration , but for less than ten bucks I dont regret purchasing it. The bangs had to be cut they were way too long, they were a bit difficult to cut, and very thick and have a little bit of a  cowlick.  The fibers are soft but still tangle easily. I styled mine into high pigtails with light hairspray, the part in the back shows the tracks due to the thinness of the wig in that area, but since my hair is dark, in most lights you can hardly notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a beautiful wig and well worth the price, but it is nothing absolutely spectacular :] ♥</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing. I bought it for my con outfit, but I&#x27;m really considering wearing it out. I sprayed dry shampoo in it to kinda get a less shiny look. The fibers are amazingly soft and the colors and adorable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosplayer and is usually picky with wigs. I&#x27;m only giving it a four because the wig was very beautiful and of a good quality, but the coloring is not exactly like the picture. In the picture it shows the blue-green coloring the bottom, but on the actual item the colors are put together(the blue-green and the black). But despite the color issue, the wig is hard to get into tangles if used normally. It&#x27;s soft to the touch and the curls are easy to re-do.</li>
    <li> Disappointed because the wig is mostly grey colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From picture I thought it was a darker black and / or brown color and not grey.</li>
    <li> awesome on many levels tho mine seems more color less dark to it if that makes sense like seems to be all one color and its seafoamish</li>
    <li> Love it! Very thick and looks almost natural.</li>
    <li> The item i got was nothing like the picture. it was brown and bright green not as nice as the colors in the picture and there was no black hair to be found. am currently acrylic ink dying it so that it will have the right coloring will post a pic of final results but so far after the ink dying it looks almost exactly like the picture. so worth it if your willing to put some extra work into it and buy a few supplies. (about $6 worth)</li>
    <li> This wig is great, flirty, fun, and best of all, very inexpensive.  I got a ton of compliments!</li>
    <li> This was my first time getting a wig that wasn&#x27;t like what one would get at Halloween, and I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased! I made my order on May 27th, it was shipped on the same day, and its delivery estimate was June 20th - July 9th. Instead, I received it today, June 4th, in a zip lock baggy (inside its shipping packaging of course) with a wig net. After a short brushing, which it actually didn&#x27;t really need, only a few strands came out due to it. It also fits my head nicely while it handles my bunched up, thick hair very well. (I&#x27;m actually wearing it as I type this!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is almost spot on to the picture. The blue/green color is actually a bit brighter in person while the grey isn&#x27;t totally a grey. It&#x27;s got a maroon/red color along with it, but I thought this little factor was a pleasant surprise! In my opinion, I thought it made it appear much better. Shh, don&#x27;t tell anyone I said that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry about not having an actual wig cap, unlike myself (I went and bought some). Along with the wig, a, in my case, black mesh, I think it was, had been included. I should add that it&#x27;s not exactly cool, temperature wise, to wear it. I&#x27;m only relaxing on the couch with it on, having not really done anything, and my ears and head are rather warm, but it&#x27;s a comfortable warm, to me at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, shipping was fast, there were no problems, and it&#x27;s an amazing wig. I can&#x27;t wait to go out of the house with it on!!</li>
    <li> Ends are almost completely down about 3 - 4 inches from the bottom. Not a nice dark brown - a paler brown, making it look very unprofessional. Wig is thick and has a lot of hair - can barely see weaving underneath. Just don&#x27;t want to wear it until I can figure out what to do about the ends other than butting them off.</li>
</ol>
