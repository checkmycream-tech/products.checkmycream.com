      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Dirty skinn if you are fair skinned like me.</li>

      <li>i wanted a product to give a me a nice glitter shimmer with out that cheap glitter look, and saw my mom used this product and it looked great on her, but also found out it had been discontinued, so i promptly bought this.</li>
      <li>It gives a nice glow.</li>
      <li>but I add it on my own.</li>
      <li>Ordered two because I have used it before and liked it.</li>
      <li>Looks nice on legs in summer.</li>
      <li>It has a very pleasant frangrance that lingers, which is nice and it seems to be very moisturizing</li>
      <li>It gives you a VERY light shimmer, which is nice for some, but</li>
      <li>This is by far the best \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; lotion around.  </li>
      <li>The soft shimmer radiance moisturizer is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>No longer in stores, so happy to have found it and priced very well!</li>
      <li>So glad I found this on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love this product, but its not on tore shelves any longer ~</li>
      <li>I love to use this lotion to accentuate muscle tone and make myself look more toned during the summer months.  </li>
      <li>I want to never run out again since I will not be able to get it again.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>Use it most during the summer months to give a shimmer</li>
      <li>I used this lotion about 10 years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores since.  </li>
      <li>(twice what it used to sell for at CVS), but still love it.</li>
      <li>but...............  the cosmetic effect on the body and the shimmer and shine it brings is really fantastic and amazing</li>
      <li>I do not prefer the tanning lotions so this is more of my liking.</li>
      <li>I LOVE to use it on my legs when I wear a dress.</li>
      <li>I love the way my skin looks with this on.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>The housing market after the bubble burst was better than this.  </li>
      <li>, I love this product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to realize this is not glittery/sparkly, it makes your skin glow!</li>
      <li>It gives you just a bit of a shimmer on your skin and makes you look healthy and radiant.</li>
      <li>&quot; kinnda made me want to know more  </li>
      <li>so I am glad I was able to find it on here</li>
      <li>so since i love to tan (taninng beds 2 times a week)</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to locate it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>less than i wanted, almost kinda like a glitter bronzer, so in the sun, you can see it perfectly, but i wanted mine to be seen anywhere, but it looked so nice</li>
      <li>And it does have a glowing soft shimmer (as advertised lol), not so much of a &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34; look, looks great in the sun.</li>
      <li>now i live in israel and about 2 years ago when i visited the GREAT usa</li>
      <li>This is a gorgeous lotion, but you do need a certain \\&quot;warmth to your skin\\&quot; because the shimmer is a warmer tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This wrks fine.</li>
      <li>I wish it was still available in the stores.</li>
      <li>But if you do any stage work, this is not the produst that reflects light like you might think.</li>
      <li>I use this after I&#x27;m dressed, smooth it on shoulders, legs.  </li>
      <li>But its not for me because my eczema (according to my break out) doesn&#x27;t really care for the lotion, but it is a nice product.</li>
      <li>I like to use self-tanner and then apply this lovely golden shimmer lotion to my legs and arms.</li>
      <li>and they were soooo cheap</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s definitely not worth the money when you can get a perfectly lovely nice shimmer elsewhere, that smells great and has a reasonable price tag.  </li>
      <li>It also is highly scented with a warm, clean, fragrant smell.</li>
      <li>The product is awesome, just the right amount of shimmer and its very suttle but enough that I know its there!!!!</li>
      <li>On special days I apply leg makeup, but it can look unnatural on my legs.</li>
      <li>Burn bright red.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to have quite as much shimmer as before, but I am satisfied.</li>
      <li>It has a great smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling that some lotions do, but not watery like some other lotions can be, but I guess that depends on your skin and complexion.</li>
      <li>Not too much sparkle, and not too little, just perfect.</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal user of this lotion for years.  </li>
      <li>Dazzling all day long!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is such a wonderful product my only wish is that they made this by the gallon with a pump because I use so much!</li>
      <li>I will not be wearing this product often unless I dress up and need that golden sparkle to my skin.</li>
      <li>I love the shimmer for a final light touch on my face.  </li>
      <li>The reflectors add sheen, and it looks natural, healthy.</li>
      <li>I found it here as a two pack and bought it right away.  </li>
      <li>It gives just the right amount of gold shimmer.</li>
      <li>It has just the right amount of shimmer.  </li>
      <li>Also has a very subtle tint to it so it does give you a bit of color which is perfect for my ivory skin.</li>
      <li>It is thick and very effective and the shimmer is very pretty.  </li>
      <li>I used this several years ago with my best friend, and we thought it the best lotion ever and were so disappointed when it was discontinued!</li>
      <li>ever since it first came out about 4 or 5 years ago, I think.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Damned sight better than red)!</li>

    <li> I have been a loyal user of this lotion for years.  For whatever reason, it was impossible to find in stores this summer.  I found it here as a two pack and bought it right away.  It gives you a subtle glow/tint/glitter.  I hate tanning beds and self tanner, so this is a good alternative for a nice glow.  No staining!</li>
    <li> No longer in stores, so happy to have found it and priced very well!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years... ever since it first came out about 4 or 5 years ago, I think.&lt;br /&gt;  I love it!!!!!  When I ran out of it in May I went to the same store I always buy it at and couldn&#x27;t find it.  Like a lot of things, I just thought maybe they weren&#x27;t selling it anymore.  I went to a ton of other stores and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;  I spent a lot of time this summer shopping at stores I don&#x27;t always shop it, to no avail.  When I googled it, much to my dismay, I found out it was discontinued by Jergen&#x27;s.  WHY!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  I ordered a ton of it on amazon.com, and I do mean a ton.  I want to never run out again since I will not be able to get it again.&lt;br /&gt;  Maybe in the meantime Jergen&#x27;s will bring it back.  PLEASE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. I do not prefer the tanning lotions so this is more of my liking. It gives you just a bit of a shimmer on your skin and makes you look healthy and radiant. I love it!</li>
    <li> The lotion was exactly what it said it would be. Also it arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> i wanted a product to give a me a nice glitter shimmer with out that cheap glitter look, and saw my mom used this product and it looked great on her, but also found out it had been discontinued, so i promptly bought this. It gives you a VERY light shimmer, which is nice for some, but less than i wanted, almost kinda like a glitter bronzer, so in the sun, you can see it perfectly, but i wanted mine to be seen anywhere, but it looked so nice, i didn&#x27;t mind. But its not for me because my eczema (according to my break out) doesn&#x27;t really care for the lotion, but it is a nice product. and the reviewer that said it turned you yellow, if you glob a large amount on your skin to make it shimmer more or whatever, it will turn you yellow, but not a normal sensible amount. Like i said great product but not for me, i found a powdered version of what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and could not find it at my local store.  So was thrilled to be able to find in on Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> This is the only shimmer lotion that does not  look like glitter for arts and crafts, it is suttle enough to wear for office&lt;br /&gt;Or evening , looks great , does not rub off on clothes, and does not have tint, so you don &#x27;t look like you have&lt;br /&gt;Dirty skinn if you are fair skinned like me.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It has a great smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling that some lotions do, but not watery like some other lotions can be, but I guess that depends on your skin and complexion. But it works great on me, and my daughter, mom, and sister.  And it does have a glowing soft shimmer (as advertised lol), not so much of a &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34; look, looks great in the sun. It has a gold-like hue, but not like a self-tanner. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone! It&#x27;s hard to find, not sure if it&#x27;s discontinued? Anyway- 5 stars!</li>
    <li> i am a VERY VERY high end cosmetics and skin care junkie...........  and i tried all the high end brands body lotions(chanel,sisley,la prairie,YSL,guerlain,la mer and thats to name a few)  now i live in israel and about 2 years ago when i visited the GREAT usa, i came across this product,now normally i would not buy(or even take a \\&quot;glance\\&quot; on drugstore brands)but the title of the lotion \\&quot;soft shimmer\\&quot; kinnda made me want to know more  so since i love to tan (taninng beds 2 times a week) i like my body to have a glow and all the lotions that had shimmering in them that i tried were just to fake and tackey looking   so i bought this lotion to try it and I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVED IT!!!!!!  its so amazing and subtle and just gives a wonderfull glow (not sparkle) GLOW!!!  so the next day i bought 10 more of them(so i could bring back home with me ,since we dont have jergens in israel)  and they were soooo cheap i had to buy them.  i used the whole 12 of them in less then two years and now came online to order more here to israel............  didnt find it anywhere online and found out THAT IT WAS DISCONTINUED,AND GOT SO MAD:-(!!! why? why? why? why? why?  well thank god i found it on amazon and saw that they still sell some old lotions.  so i went ahead and bought 10 of them from this exccelent seller (dealsbuzzhealth) and be cause they dont ship to israel i had to ship it to my sister in the states,and then she shipped it to me and i got it AND IM SOOO HAPPY(but sad that it will be the last time i could order this lotion :-(  now again i dont think this is a \\&quot;great and wonderfull\\&quot; MOISTURIZING body lotion (cause its not!!!) but...............  the cosmetic effect on the body and the shimmer and shine it brings is really fantastic and amazing (and i just put it on top of my regular body lotion for the shimmer effect)  JERGENS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BRING THIS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!  sorry if i have any spelling errors,have fun :-)  sarai from israel</li>
    <li> I love this product!  The only problem is, I can never find it at the store anymore - which is why I&#x27;ve just started to order it online.  Product arrived promptly.  No problems or complaints what-so-ever.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is by far the best \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; lotion around.  (And BTW, I just bought Dove Energy Glow Beauty Body Lotion \\&quot;for a sikly shimmer\\&quot; - the Dove lotion is white.  I don&#x27;t see any shimmer, it&#x27;s just a basic white lotion and doesn&#x27;t even have a fresh fragrance.  Yikes.)    Anyway, the JERGENS SOFT SHIMMER is a gold color and leaves a definite shimmery glow on the skin.  It&#x27;s not glitter, it&#x27;s just shimmer - it is the perfect lotion for any time of year.  I have no idea why this lotion would be D/C&#x27;d....  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I am so sorry to report that I didn&#x27;t love this product and I really really really wanted to. I am a 30-something African-American, prefessional woman and wanted that beautiful glow that Michelle Obama&#x27;s skin always seems to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research on what makes skin skin glow like that and I found that it wasn&#x27;t olive oil or anything like that, but a shimmering product. They appear in all price ranges but this one got such high reviews and was so reasonably priced, I jumped at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviewer who said it made her skin look yellow must be very fair-skinned. If you have even the slightest bit of color to your skin and don&#x27;t over-use the product, yellowness won&#x27;t be an issue. It has a very pleasant frangrance that lingers, which is nice and it seems to be very moisturizing and it really is a pleasure to use. But I didn&#x27;t get the glowy shimmer I hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make your skin look like you&#x27;ve put in some extra effort, you know, like you were paying attention when you got dressed. But if you do any stage work, this is not the produst that reflects light like you might think. Go ahead and try a little olive oil. Just a little...</li>
    <li> I used this lotion about 10 years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores since.  I was very excited to locate it on Amazon.  The lotion itself is very good.  A lot of shimmer lotions concentrate on the shimmer and not so much on the moisture, but this one does both.  It is thick and very effective and the shimmer is very pretty.  The smell, though, is not as good as I remember it.  It isn&#x27;t bad by any means but there isn&#x27;t too much to it and I always like a little scent in my lotion.</li>
    <li> Gives softly glitter to your skin while moisturizing. I LOVE to use it on my legs when I wear a dress.</li>
    <li> This lotion gives just enough shimmer to accent whatever you wear! A little bit goes a long way. I wish it was still available in the stores.</li>
    <li> Satisfied. Have used this in the past but it went off the market. Found it on Amazon. Doesn&#x27;t seem to have quite as much shimmer as before, but I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> It was impossible to find this product in a store.  I don&#x27;t know why it was discontinued.  I love the subtle sparkle in the sun.  I only wish that it was a 30 SPF added to it...but I add it on my own.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It softens and moisturizes skin, AND it leaves a shimmery glow too!!  I think Jergen does not make this product any longer.  What a pity!!  However, you can still buy it on the Web.  Note:  It is NOT a self-tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this product!  So bummed that Jergens discontinued it and I had to pay so much on line (twice what it used to sell for at CVS), but still love it.</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous lotion, but you do need a certain \\&quot;warmth to your skin\\&quot; because the shimmer is a warmer tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would normally give the product a 5, but definitely NOT the price, and it&#x27;s a real shame.  The housing market after the bubble burst was better than this.  This lotion when in stores, was only in the range of $4-$7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a bit of information on the inflation of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this exact same product, a 2 pack 7.5 oz order on June 12, 2011 for $12 even.  At the time I had Amazon Prime so the shipping was free,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW on a different date:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this exact same product, a 2 pack 7.5 oz order on Sept 24, 2012 .  At that time I again, had Amazon Prime so the shipping was free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now sellers are charging well over double that.  With this price you should be getting 4-5 of these suckers.  And a 6 pack is $75?????  I&#x27;m sorry, I love this product but that&#x27;s ridiculous.  It&#x27;s JERGEN&#x27;S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s has a slightly thinner but quite comparable shimmer lotion that actually smells better. It&#x27;s so much more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the prices were to get \\&quot;normal\\&quot; again, I&#x27;d definitely buy this.  It has a very boring smell, but it&#x27;s got a great soft shimmer, and the texture feels great smoothing it on. But it&#x27;s definitely not worth the money when you can get a perfectly lovely nice shimmer elsewhere, that smells great and has a reasonable price tag.  It&#x27;s really too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I love Amazon and RAVE to people about what a joy I have ordering amazing products on here, and the great deals that I find.  So it actually pains me to have written such a poor review about ANY product--let alone a product I normally gush over :(</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am upset that I can no longer purchase this due to it being discontinued by Jergens.</li>
    <li> I wanted to stock up because Jergens isn&#x27;t making soft Shimmer anymore. I wanted a shimmer without a bunch of perfume and without a bronzer.  I&#x27;ve used this for many years. Looks nice on legs in summer.</li>
    <li> I wear this everyday on my face...you just need a little bit..It&#x27;s hard to find in the store so I am glad I was able to find it on here</li>
    <li> I bought this in a drug store once and was not able to find it again. I recently found it on Amazon. I use this in the summertime. It has tiny sparkles that give a sun-lit effect on legs and arms!</li>
    <li> I tried this because of the raving reviews.  I found it to be greasy, and turned my skin a yellow tone. I guess it would be okay for someone&#x27;s who&#x27;s skin is yellow, but mine is a rosy tone, and I really hated how this made me look.</li>
    <li> The soft shimmer radiance moisturizer is wonderful.  It has just the right amount of shimmer.  Really brightens the skin.  I will recommend this product to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> I love the shimmer for a final light touch on my face.  It gives a nice glow. I use it on my body also when I am not using my Obsession.  Obsession if for special occasions and shimmer is daily.</li>
    <li> A positive about this lotion is the shimmer effects (which is why I purchased it) However, the product doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell and rubs off on everything you touch. The steering wheel in my car, yet alone everything I touch in my car, has a gold hue to it. I will not be wearing this product often unless I dress up and need that golden sparkle to my skin.</li>
    <li> I used to use this moisturizer all the time but who on earth would pay $84+ for two tubes of lotion? Not me!!  I will not buy this for this price. It appears to be unavailable anywhere else but it is the only lotion that actually does shimmer without being glitzy and cheap looking on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love the product. It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because it has the shimmer in the lotion. I don&#x27;t know why but you just can&#x27;t find any lotions anymore with the shimmer in them. I like to use self-tanner and then apply this lovely golden shimmer lotion to my legs and arms. What a gorgeous effect it has - no more chalky white skin. Glistening golden very subtle sexy shimmer.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion, and use it on my legs all summer. It adds radiance that is not greasy. I like that it is not glittery; I&#x27;m a grown woman and don&#x27;t want sparkle. Instead it has reflectors that produce sheen. I have a few marks on my legs and this lotion helps my confidence. On special days I apply leg makeup, but it can look unnatural on my legs. So I mix this lotion with the makeup, and then apply to the legs. The reflectors add sheen, and it looks natural, healthy. I don&#x27;t want a tanning product, which it seems all the other radiance lotions contain, but this one does not. It also is highly scented with a warm, clean, fragrant smell. I am a repeat buyer of this, and I regret my local stores don&#x27;t stock this anymore. I hope to buy this lotion as long as it is available. This seller offered it at the lowest price + shipping that I could find, and I received it promptly in the mail.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion. I wish they would make it again! Thank goodness I can get it here, at least for a while.</li>
    <li> I really like Jergen&#x27;s Soft Shimmer and was having a time finding this in the stores.  Loved the product and the service! I had to stock up!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, but its not on tore shelves any longer ~ so when I turned to Amazon for it, I was thrilled to find it!! The product is awesome, just the right amount of shimmer and its very suttle but enough that I know its there!!!!</li>
    <li> I like that this creams doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent which is a plus for me.  It gives just the right amount of gold shimmer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on the many positive reviews on Amazon since I was looking for a shimmer lotion to accent my tan, Unfortunately after quite a few days of using it, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference on my skin. I will continue to use it as a regular moisturizer but probably won&#x27;t order any more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect shimmer lotion! Dazzling all day long!!! Not too much sparkle, and not too little, just perfect. Only problem is it&#x27;s not sold in any stores I know of, so I must get my fix online - it is very much worth it. It is unscented, and can be combined with any other lotion of your choice to add as much shine and shimmer to your day as you like.</li>
    <li> I hve a ruddy red Irish complexion. Burn bright red. No pain but look like Bozo the clown!  Other bronzers turned me ORANGE! This wrks fine. Covers the red. Gives a little glow but ok for a guy. (Damned sight better than red)! Gr8 price for 2 big bottles. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Can someone please tell me why you can no longer find this in stores?! This lotion is beautiful. I use it for special events, when I show a little leg, at the beach and basically anytime I show skin. You will looks red carpet ready every time you use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Put it on your legs for a subtle gleam or on your chest for a \\&quot;Come Hither,\\&quot; look. I love the way my skin looks with this on. I feel like a shimmery goddess! Also has a very subtle tint to it so it does give you a bit of color which is perfect for my ivory skin. This does not look tacky, gaudy or garish. I promise you will not look like a glitter Barbie. I do, however, recommend washing your hands after applying or you will have very silly looking fairy dust palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a wonderful product my only wish is that they made this by the gallon with a pump because I use so much!</li>
    <li> My favorite and now I must find another shimmer lotion since this is discontinued and everyone is charging an arm and leg for it now :(</li>
    <li> I used this several years ago with my best friend, and we thought it the best lotion ever and were so disappointed when it was discontinued! It&#x27;s important to realize this is not glittery/sparkly, it makes your skin glow! I loved using this in summer because it makes you look even tanner! The scent is so subtle and unoffensive.  This is the perfect lotion and I&#x27;ve stocked up, and got several for friends!</li>
    <li> Ordered two because I have used it before and liked it. Use it most during the summer months to give a shimmer</li>
    <li> I use this after I&#x27;m dressed, smooth it on shoulders, legs.  I&#x27;m not sure if the subtle shimmer would come off on clothes.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, glad to find here!  It&#x27;s perfect for summer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that this product caused my skin to have an allergic reaction.  I think it was the little sparkle particles in the lotion.</li>
    <li> This item was for a friend of mine who couldn&#x27;t find it anymore, so when I saw it on your website, I had to get it for her.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to her for Mother&#x27;s Day. She was thrilled.</li>
    <li> I love to use this lotion to accentuate muscle tone and make myself look more toned during the summer months.  So glad I found this on Amazon.</li>
