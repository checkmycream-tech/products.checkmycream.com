### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to buy it-as I said, benzoyl peroxide is the best.</li>
      <li>As a consumer who is still searching for the best skin products for my skin-type and complexion, I decided to try this product from the Amazon Vine program.  </li>
      <li>Definitely an excellent product.</li>
      <li>LOL!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had very good results like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even though it takes longer than 4 hours, as claimed by the product, she is happy.</li>
      <li>This item always helps my skin during break outs and keeps my skin looking great.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a product that&#x27;ll help accelerate the healing process of acne, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>No, but it will greatly minimize it.  </li>
      <li>this was a great savings, speedy delivery</li>
      <li>It worked perfectly in the 4 hr window,  love it</li>
      <li>It is good.  </li>
      <li>However, and to be fair, the price is competitive and I would still purchase this product knowing that it works, just not instantaneously.  </li>
      <li>Product works good.</li>
      <li>Both my daughter and I put it to the test, and as with all Clearasil Creams I&#x27;ve ever used, this one also has good results.</li>
      <li>So as I said perhaps good for some but not for all.</li>
      <li>good news is with 10% benzoyl peroxide, it did not burn her skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and great product!</li>
      <li>Maybe some kind of buzzer or alarm you can stick to their bathroom mirror.  </li>
      <li>The dual pack is nice though.</li>
      <li>I would wash my face, and it would turn all nice and sparkly.</li>
      <li>It is effective.</li>
      <li>and I want to go away before they need their own zip code.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest: The Proactiv version does work better/faster for me, but it is peroxide</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done is that I use the Proactiv product in the day time when my face isn&#x27;t touching anything, and at night I use this product because it does work, not as good as the Proactiv product,</li>
      <li>Anyway, I will keep these and hope the formula is still effective despite the product age.</li>
      <li>product is easy and pleasant to use.  </li>
      <li>this is just as good or better than any of those brands for a better price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does go on non-greasy and it is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>This is very strong stuff.</li>
      <li>I LOVE that about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It took a couple more uses of the cream before the acne was eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m a fan of benzoyl peroxide for these things because I think it works better and dries things out.</li>
      <li>Wish it did more to battle redness too.</li>
      <li>This product does a great job of getting rid of breakouts fast.</li>
      <li>I used this in highschool and it worked like magic.</li>
      <li>This is prominently displayed on the front of the box.  </li>
      <li>But healing takes more time than 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>:)    </li>
      <li>The idea of being able to more quickly eliminate acne was very appealing to me</li>
      <li>It just takes patience and care to get great skin and this product has truly helped me keep my sensitive acne prone skin under control.     </li>
      <li>Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Treatment Vanishing Cream, the percentage of benzoyl acid is 10%, which in my experience is very effective.</li>
      <li>A good classic product.</li>
      <li>Im totally fine with flaking skin around a blemish when it is promoting healing.  </li>
      <li>and this is a huge</li>
      <li>Great, but these same free radicles are the things that cause premature skin aging - the ones that the TV commercials for sunblock always talk about.  </li>
      <li>It did not work as fast as I would have liked it to.  </li>
      <li>depend on this if you are 4 hours away from a big event, but works great if you give it time and use as directed.</li>
      <li>works by promoting the creation of free radicles, which will kill the bacteria that are causing the pimple/zit/cyst.  </li>
      <li>size of the tube is generous compared to other brands, which is nice, and price is good too.</li>
      <li>If you have used benzoyl peroxide in the past with good results, this may be a good buy.</li>
      <li>noticed that, when applied as directed, it did minimize a significant pimple within a day or so.  </li>
      <li>But for the most part, it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and disappears quickly, leaving no trace.  </li>
      <li>It works great as a spot treatment and will work to dry out pimples.  </li>
      <li>nice clear skin.</li>
      <li>This seems to work great on helping to control a severe case of acne, it is not as drying as other things we have used.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for people with acne due to oily skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s far from perfect, but if I really need to dry a pimple out, it helps.</li>
      <li>The key is to moisturize with a oil free (light) cream...and you will be A-okay!</li>
      <li>The difference between the two products, in practice, is that the Rapid Action Cream is thinner and runnier, more like a lotion than a cream.</li>
      <li>Not only would I continue to use this product, but indeed recommend it to others for a rapid vanishing treatment that has proven to be extremely effective.</li>
      <li>I will say that this works better with \\&quot;old age\\&quot; pimples than has anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Later, she said, \\&quot;I liked it.  </li>
      <li>product did not irritate my skin at all, was a decent consistency and does not have a strong or offensive fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is powerful medication for cysts and stubborn acne.  </li>
      <li>It is a simple cream that goes on easily and dries very quickly.  </li>
      <li>The other thing I noticed is that this cream caused a fair amount of itching in the places where it was applied.  </li>
      <li>After cleaning my face at night, I put this on right afterwards.</li>
      <li>My skin is very fair, sensitive, and it has been subject to acne and rosacea for 50 years.  </li>
      <li>(\\&quot;it&#x27;s normal!\\&quot;), but there are other treatments beyond the over-the-counter remedies that you&#x27;ll find on Amazon, and some of them are pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin or skin that is easily irritated.</li>
      <li>As a pharmacist, I have a natural tendency to assume that generic products are every bit as good as brand-name ones.</li>
      <li>There hasn&#x27;t been very much improvement in his skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>short, I found that Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Treatment Vanishing Cream  is an excellent problem for acne characterized by inflamed red spots; it worked better than I expected.</li>
      <li>it really works!</li>
      <li>The first two times, it cleared up the blemish by morning.  </li>
      <li>in my experience, within 5-6 hours, my blemishes had lost most of their redness and were significantly smaller.</li>
      <li>LIKE IT SAYS IT TAKES MORE LIKE TWO DAYS AT LAST</li>
      <li>After about a month of use, the only thing I saw was more redness and irritation.</li>
      <li>The vanishing (white) formulation is infinitely better.</li>
      <li>so I thought I would try this product to make sure I would not breakout before the big event.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this, it lived up to its promise.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything differently than other products, ALTHOUGH it is the best product so far to apply make up over.</li>
      <li>Once it goes on, then I can let it dry and apply makeup right over the top.</li>
      <li>I had a special event to go to recently and wanted my skin to look clear and healthy.</li>
      <li>Clearasil squeeze tube is superior to the generic bottle, but is pricier than the generic.</li>
      <li>10 days later and the wife&#x27;s skin really hasn&#x27;t changed for the better.  </li>
      <li>Use it over the entire affected area (e.g., your entire face minus the eyes) on a consistent basis for the greatest effectiveness.</li>
      <li>But she is not giving up hope as she is willing to try this application for a whole week to see if her skin needs to acclimate to this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While white, it rubs into the skin easily so it can be used during the daytime.  </li>
      <li>WAY expired (not just a few months, but more than a year!).</li>
      <li>My sample expires 10/14, so there was no outdated problems.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t hurt so much.</li>
      <li>: Dries the pimples fast.</li>
      <li>This Clearasil product works really well for me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, even in highschool it was lying in that it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference in four hours.</li>
      <li>I would really reccomend this item</li>
      <li>as spot-treatment as well, especially if you have more sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Certainly this cream does go to work right away, and will dry up the area where it is applied quite quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  That&#x27;s all I can ask.</li>
    <li> Recently, at age 62, I developed acne for the first time in my life - red blotches all over my cheeks. The first product I tried to counteract it, Clearasil ultra pore cleaning pads, contains salicyclic acid, and after three weeks of regular use appeared to be worsening the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Online researched revealed that although some forms of acne (blackheads, blemishes related to dead skin cells and clogged pores) respond well to salicylic acid products, other forms of acne (caused by bacteria, and characterized by red inflamed spots) are best treated with products containing benzoyl acid. As I discovered, the amount of benzoyl acid in these products is generally as low as 2.5% and as high as 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Treatment Vanishing Cream, the percentage of benzoyl acid is 10%, which in my experience is very effective. Note that the Clearasil claim of \\&quot;visibly reducing redness and spot size in as little as four hours\\&quot; indicates \\&quot;AS LITTLE AS four hours\\&quot; not \\&quot;WITHIN four hours\\&quot;. Those expecting four hour relief may have inflated expectations - Clearasil doesn&#x27;t promise magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in my experience, within 5-6 hours, my blemishes had lost most of their redness and were significantly smaller. Using it once a day for only a few days, I continued to experience significant results, and actually no longer needed to use it after 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other advantages: It dries clear and does not look as if a cream or makeup has been applied. It also doesn&#x27;t stain your pillowcase when using it overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some users have indicated that it dries the skin, and certainly if one already has very dry skin, or uses it more than once a day, drying is likely to occur. But in my limited use, I didn&#x27;t have that problem. Those concerned with drying skin could benefit by using a daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I found that Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Treatment Vanishing Cream  is an excellent problem for acne characterized by inflamed red spots; it worked better than I expected. My only criticism is that the list of ingredients on the tube was far too small to read - not one word was distinguishable.inflamed red spots; it worked better than I expected. My only criticism is that the list of ingredients on the tube was far too small to read - not one word was distinguishable.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because I paid full price in a pharmacy based on the claim that this \\&quot;visibly reduces spot size and redness in 4 hours\\&quot;.  It doesn&#x27;t.  I tried it a few times on my face and back and the product is the same as any other Benzoyl Peroxide cream.  There are marginal results after a couple days use so I&#x27;m not sure if the cream worked or if the zit was going away anyway.  But it does not do anything in 4 hours.  Maybe for some people but definitely not everyone.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t read the reviews on this product before purchasing.  I also received an older version of the product (the three-day formula, rather than the pictured and described four-hour formula), that expired 7 months ago.  The dates were cut off of the tubes, and the bottom of the box was covered (which I removed to see the expired date).  Anyway, I will keep these and hope the formula is still effective despite the product age.</li>
    <li> I used this in highschool and it worked like magic. Now, as an adult, it does nothing. So, don&#x27;t buy it if you need something for adult acne. I like Acnevir for adult acne issues.&lt;br /&gt;However, even in highschool it was lying in that it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference in four hours. Wish it did more to battle redness too. The dual pack is nice though.</li>
    <li> I would wash my face, and it would turn all nice and sparkly. Then in the morning, it would be terribly icky again. Then I tried this clearasil product out (I WAS a neutrogena person). After cleaning my face at night, I put this on right afterwards. In the morning I woke up and BAM! My face is glowing! Sometimes when I&#x27;m too tired at night. I just use a face wipe and then put the clearasil on. Wake up in the morning, and my face is still amazingly clear.</li>
    <li> I never have pimples. But I had a massive breakout. I used this, along with the Yes to Carrots products, and the pimples were gone in under 2 days. Does work, but you HAVE to use it three times a day as stated in the directions.</li>
    <li> As a pharmacist, I have a natural tendency to assume that generic products are every bit as good as brand-name ones. This product, however, is one of the few notable exceptions. Due to the unique formulation (which helps the medication penetrate the top layers of the skin), it simply works much better than other similar benzoyl peroxide products (brand or generic). Every time I switch, I end up with big problems (namely, those rare but life-altering, have-their-own-zip-code, painful nodules or cysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, and this is a huge but, I&#x27;ll never buy this product from Amazon again. Last time I ordered, it was expired. WAY expired (not just a few months, but more than a year!). This is simply not acceptable. I prefer Amazon, but from here on out I&#x27;ll be buying this locally or from the unnamed big online drug store retailer (which, incidentally, has never sent me an expired product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other advice is to take it slow if you experience excessive peeling or dryness. Back down to once a day or even every other day. As your skin adjusts, you can increase the frequency if necessary. Use it over the entire affected area (e.g., your entire face minus the eyes) on a consistent basis for the greatest effectiveness. Spot treatment helps clear up existing acne lesions but doesn&#x27;t do anything to prevent them. You&#x27;ve got to use it (in a thin layer) over the whole area, consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t get the tinted stuff. I did, once, on accident. It&#x27;s awful. The vanishing (white) formulation is infinitely better.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not so \\&quot;impossible\\&quot; how these are discounted since they sell expired products!  As the other reviewers stated, they sent me expired products where they attempted to cut the expiration date off but you can still see it, and these expired in 2/10 and 6/10.  Also, as stated in other reviews, I got the 3 day formula and NOT the 4 hour formula!  So be warned, SHADY seller!!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great product!</li>
    <li> This worked just like any other benzyl peroxide cream for me. It definitely reduced the size of a pimple on my face within a day (more or less depending), but definitely not in 4 hours. It works though, and seeing as I bought it to replace my previous benzyl peroxide cream, I&#x27;m not completely disappointed. The texture and application of this medication is much better than other ones I have used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t depend on this if you are 4 hours away from a big event, but works great if you give it time and use as directed.</li>
    <li> seems to have been reducing my break outs!</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly in the 4 hr window,  love it</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about using this product but it sure does work! I had a special event to go to recently and wanted my skin to look clear and healthy. My skin is sensitive and breakouts frequently...so I thought I would try this product to make sure I would not breakout before the big event. Well it worked! In the morning and at night I would wash with the Clearasil 12 hour cream srub, moisturize with Clinique Dramatically Differently Gel and the follow with the 4 hour acne treatment (all over the acne prone areas). My skin was crystal clear by day 3! Total Transformation. It just takes patience and care to get great skin and this product has truly helped me keep my sensitive acne prone skin under control.     Pros: Dries the pimples fast. I had a breakout appear after a trip to the gym...Sweat and oily hair mistake...and in about 2-4 hours it was almost totally gone. In the morning, almost couldnt even notice it.    Cons: Can make the skin dry and tight and a little uncomfortable. The key is to moisturize with a oil free (light) cream...and you will be A-okay! :)    Hope this review helps someone!</li>
    <li> A total waste of money.  If you got zits... I guess only time will cure it.  Otherwise go see a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I have oily, break-out prone, adult skin and this product did not help me in any way. After about a month of use, the only thing I saw was more redness and irritation.</li>
    <li> This item is clearly supposed to include a \\&quot;pack of 2\\&quot;, but they only send one.  It&#x27;s a total rip-off and waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> it make my face worse</li>
    <li> As someone in their 30&#x27;s who still gets occasional random pimples, this stuffs the only thing that works for me.  I don&#x27;t get acne, just like one or two random pimples if I don&#x27;t shave for a few days.  I put this stuff on as directed and the pimples usually go away by the next day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and it works pretty well. It does decrease the size of the pimple, but not in four hours. It may take a day or at max two, but it does work.</li>
    <li> This is very strong stuff. If you have sensitive skin, beware! My girlfriend tried to use this and it dried her skin out very badly. We could never tell if it worked or not because she couldn&#x27;t leave it on for very long. If you have hardcore acne, try it. For small pimples, this just seems like overkill.</li>
    <li> Product arrived and it was already passed the expiration date.  Looked like someone had tried to hide this fact.  I think the age hurt the quality of the product because it did not work as well as one I had purchased in the store that was over a year before it expired.</li>
    <li> i cant comment on the actual product, because what i was sent was an expired product. I was able to submit for a refund, but very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Product works good. Sometimes it leaves your skin oily. The box they came in were badly damaged and so were the tubes.</li>
    <li> What is Clearasil&#x27;s \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; Rapid Action vanishing Treatment Cream?  It is a cream containing 10% benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient.  The other, inactive ingredients are: Water, Propylene Glycol, Aluminium Hydroxide, Bentonite, Glyceryl Stearate SE, PEG-12, Isopropyl Myristate, Methylparaben, Carbomer, Potassium Hydroxide, and Propylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is advertised as showing results in as little as four hours.  This is prominently displayed on the front of the box.  I view this as marketing more than anything else, for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The product claims to use Acceladerm technology, but little information is available on what this \\&quot;technology\\&quot; does.  It claims to accelerate the active ingredient&#x27;s work.&lt;br /&gt;2. The product package states \\&quot;as little\\&quot; as four hours, which by contrast may mean \\&quot;as many as x hours.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;3. This is a 10% benzoyl peroxide solution, so while it is strong, it is no stronger or faster acting than any other 10% benzoyl peroxide product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying it is a bad product, not at all.  It is good.  But the manufacturer may be taking a few liberties.....such is the marketing world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to strong OTC acne medicine, typically you find a cream/gel that contains 10% benzoyl peroxide or 2% salicylic acid.  Another typical strength you may see is 2.5% benzoyl peroxide.  Being a 10% benzoyl peroxide product, this cream does work.  Carefully applied to a pimple it will go to work and should reduce it, etc.  Again, 4 hours seems a little optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that, when applied as directed, it did minimize a significant pimple within a day or so.  Also, for a smaller pimple, it will noticeably diminish it in a few hours. Vanish? No, but it will greatly minimize it.  As with other creams of this type, drying/flaking can be an issue, so apply as directed, only onto a pimple itself, not clear skin, and don&#x27;t over-do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any benzoyl peroxide product, avoid getting it on clothing, towels etc. as it will stain like a bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works - I don&#x27;t think it works any more quickly than any other product, such as Oxy 10 Maximum or a less expensive store brand.  I do like it, I just think the 4 hour thing can be misleading.t on clothing, towels etc. as it will stain like a bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works - I don&#x27;t think it works any more quickly than any other product, such as Oxy 10 Maximum or a less expensive store brand.  I do like it, I just think the 4 hour thing can be misleading.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;Clearasil&#x27; products over 25 years, especially &#x27;Clearasil Creams.&#x27; This new improved rapid action vanishing cream is very gentle. Both my daughter and I put it to the test, and as with all Clearasil Creams I&#x27;ve ever used, this one also has good results. Very little is needed, it&#x27;s not messy, and it works fast. This Ultra Clearasil Cream contains Benzoyl peroxide 10%, which obviously aids in the treatment. Not only would I continue to use this product, but indeed recommend it to others for a rapid vanishing treatment that has proven to be extremely effective. In addition, as with all products, always check the expiration date. My sample expires 10/14, so there was no outdated problems. As a consumer, I never purchase any product, before checking the expiration date for safety.</li>
    <li> So I tried this, I mean I had my wife try this because nothing is working.  Oddly she is 40 years old and still gets pimples...which as a woman drives her crazy. Anyway the term \\&quot;rapid\\&quot; for this Clearasil product means 4 hours your pimples are less puffy, read, and visible.  I had my wife try this at night before bed 2 nights in a row, did she wake with less (noticeable) pimples...the answer is...wait for it...no.  But she is not giving up hope as she is willing to try this application for a whole week to see if her skin needs to acclimate to this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is with 10% benzoyl peroxide, it did not burn her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+++Update 4/18/2013+++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well 10 days later and the wife&#x27;s skin really hasn&#x27;t changed for the better.  So as I said perhaps good for some but not for all.</li>
    <li> I tend to get break outs on my chin and cheeks, along with my chest and back area. So here are my thoughts on this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 -- I saw little to no results in 4 hours. Yes, over time it does dry it up, but OVER TIME. I have used this product for a month now on my breakouts and I am not seeing any type of rapid action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 -- Dries clear -- yes, It definitely dries clear. Once it goes on, then I can let it dry and apply makeup right over the top. I LOVE that about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 -- Texture: For me it is just too runny. I feel like I am constantly squeezing out too much product, then it goes on soooo sheer that I wonder if I have enough product on the blemish. I guess it being runny is what makes it sheer and easy to apply makeup over, yet I wish it was a little bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am unsure as to whether I would purchase this again. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything differently than other products, ALTHOUGH it is the best product so far to apply make up over.</li>
    <li> My image conscious 15-year-old daughter uses this product for her pimples and it works. Even though it takes longer than 4 hours, as claimed by the product, she is happy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty nasty for the long-term health of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For context, the same active ingredient has been available for several decades.  About 20 years ago, I used to use this product religiously every night for targeted removal of painful spots and acne.  I had acne for almost 15 years before it finally went away and I used a product made by Clearasil with the same active ingredient (10% benzoyl peroxide) for almost 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works by promoting the creation of free radicles, which will kill the bacteria that are causing the pimple/zit/cyst.  Great, but these same free radicles are the things that cause premature skin aging - the ones that the TV commercials for sunblock always talk about.  In my case, this manifested as wrinkles that came a lot sooner than expected, relative to my peers or other members of my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So by all means use this product for the occasional pimple that needs to disappear, but definitely avoid using it any more than is necessary and avoid repeated application to the same spot, just as you would avoid prolonged sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you have more than occasional acne, definitely consult a doctor.  I know it seems like a stupid thing to go to a doctor for, and at least one parent will just tell you to just deal with it (\\&quot;it&#x27;s normal!\\&quot;), but there are other treatments beyond the over-the-counter remedies that you&#x27;ll find on Amazon, and some of them are pretty good.  Treatments have definitely improved in the last few decades.  Remember that family doctors and generalists are not the same as dermatologists, so see a specialist if you can.  As a final note, in my (non-medical but very experienced) opinion, the only thing worse than this stuff is Roacutane (the vitamin A precursor pill) - only use that as an absolute last resort (I think the topically applied version (generic Tretinoin) is much less risky).</li>
    <li> Even though I am getting wrinkles I still have occasional acne. I still use this product - which seems the same as the one I started using decades ago. It is effective. 10% BP is what you want unless you have sensitive skin. I find that the claims of seeing improvement in 4 hours are overblown, but I do see definite results by the next day. A good classic product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  He finds that it effectively combats pimples that are starting to form and he experiences little irritation from using it.  I have sensitive skin and have tried to use it with terrible results; my skin becomes red and itchy and starts to peel for days.  It is impossible to apply makeup because it peels away.  Benzoyl Peroxide is one of those substances that some tolerate and others do not.  Those with sensitive skin should probably avoid this.  For those with tough skin, the product is easy to apply.  While white, it rubs into the skin easily so it can be used during the daytime.  If you have used benzoyl peroxide in the past with good results, this may be a good buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people with acne due to oily skin.  It is a simple cream that goes on easily and dries very quickly.  Be sure to apply small portions at a time or it will dry before you have time to spread it all out.  It works great as a spot treatment and will work to dry out pimples.  It will also dry out your skin so be sure to use a moisturizer if your skin gets overly dry.  I actually have really oily skin and I&#x27;ve found this product to be excellent as a base coat under my makeup.  It helps prevent my skin from getting too oily throughout the day this way.  I&#x27;ve had very good results like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product claims to &amp;#34; visibly reduces pimple size and redness in as little as 4 hours &amp;#34;.  Keep in mind that this basically means a minimum of 4 hours to see results.  This may be the case if you catch a really small pimple at a really early stage.  But for large cystic pimples, expect a few days to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy and pleasant to use.  It goes on smoothly and disappears quickly, leaving no trace.  It can help to control oily skin and works great as a base coat under makeup.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Firstly, the product description reads &amp;#34;pack of 2&amp;#34; but I only received 1. The cream is odorless and goes on sheer without any weird dried-out telltale spot. It works okay, not in 4 hours, or even overnight but faster than other brands.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Treatment Cream after having bad luck with salicylic acid products, which seem to make my skin break out.  I don&#x27;t have an all-over acne problem but tend to get an isolated pimple here and there.  This Clearasil product works really well for me.  I use it once a day as needed on the affected area and have noticed my skin clears up faster than when not using anything other than my regular cleansing products (Clinique).  My skin did not get dry and flaky from once-a-day usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, some reviewers seem confused by the claim that this product reduces swelling and redness in as little as four hours.  \\&quot;In as little as\\&quot; means there&#x27;s a possibility your zit will look better in four hours.  It&#x27;s a best-case scenario and NOT the expected outcome.  How much better your skin appears is subjective, and I&#x27;ve found it really takes half a day for truly noticeable improvement.</li>
    <li> Clearasil products have never worked for me, and this one just continues the pattern. It claims to minimize redness and reduce pimple size, because it&#x27;s Clearasil&#x27;s ULTRA Rapid Action Vanishing Treatment Cream. No.&lt;br /&gt;Here are the cons of this product:&lt;br /&gt;*Once you apply the cream, it leaves your face feeling sticky and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;*It doesn&#x27;t live up to the</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult who experiences occasional acne. The idea of being able to more quickly eliminate acne was very appealing to me so I decided to give this product a try. When it arrived I had a few areas to test and put it to use before bed, putting a layer of the cream over the problem areas just as instructed. Approximately 8 hours later when I woke up I noticed a couple of the pimples seemed to be a bit smaller in size. It took a couple more uses of the cream before the acne was eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not irritate my skin at all, was a decent consistency and does not have a strong or offensive fragrance. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that&#x27;ll help accelerate the healing process of acne, this is a great product. Just don&#x27;t expect all acne to be eliminated after only 4 hours and a single application.</li>
    <li> I have a 14 yr old son who is struggling like crazy with acne on his face.  I keep trying to find things to help him.  I gave this to him and told him how to use it.  There hasn&#x27;t been very much improvement in his skin.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say, however, that when I have a break out I put the cream on it and it&#x27;s gone within a couple of days.  He&#x27;s a teenager, I think he just doesn&#x27;t use it like he&#x27;s supposed to.  If I babysit him and remind him every night to use it there is improvement.  They have to come up with a product now that reminds kids to use the products!  Maybe some kind of buzzer or alarm you can stick to their bathroom mirror.  LOL!</li>
    <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK IN FOUR HOURS LIKE IT SAYS IT TAKES MORE LIKE TWO DAYS AT LAST</li>
    <li> This product does a great job of getting rid of breakouts fast. It takes a couple of days, but definitely does help with problem spots. With regular face washings and use of this product, it is possible to keep that teenage acne under control without expensive medications! My three teenagers would highly recommend this product to other teens.</li>
    <li> I know that salacylic acid is the trend but I&#x27;m a fan of benzoyl peroxide for these things because I think it works better and dries things out. I used this on myself and on my family and each time it dried up quickly-overnight.( I&#x27;m not sure about the 4 hour claim but it was pretty reduced by 4 hours)That said, I don&#x27;t use this everyday or on basic acne-I use it on things that spring up from nowhere and I want to go away before they need their own zip code. Also, this didn&#x27;t dry my skin like I expected and I only applied it one time for it to work. I&#x27;ll continue to buy it-as I said, benzoyl peroxide is the best.</li>
    <li> this was a great savings, speedy delivery and my son uses this ..</li>
    <li> I hate that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and still getting zits, but I do, so I use zit cream. The first time I used this, it lived up to its promise. I had a pimple and it was gone over night. Other times, it took longer. But for the most part, it works pretty well. I&#x27;ve tried expensive stuff, like Proactive, I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena, Olay, and this is just as good or better than any of those brands for a better price.</li>
    <li> It works gradually in the skin, after three days of aplication you can see results.  No allergic reactions, nothing to complain.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s always a frustration to have to rely on spot-treatment, for fast-acting results there&#x27;s little better than a simple 10% benzoyl peroxide treatment and this stuff does the job. It goes on clear, won&#x27;t make your skin red, and does work well. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d expect the 4-hour miracle that it advertises, but you probably will see a difference within 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the tube is generous compared to other brands, which is nice, and price is good too. Anybody who is prone to problematic skin definitely needs to keep one of these on hand. For overnight treatment, I would also recommend using the [[ASIN:B001G7OCSM Proactiv Solution Refining Mask 2.5 Oz]] as spot-treatment as well, especially if you have more sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> for big red pimple , it does work, just be careful use it on the normal skin, i was apply overed around my acne where is normal skin, then the winkle shows uppppppppppp, i was so scary until stop use it  for take rest for a week, and apply the calm gel which is lavender gel on the winkle spot, it recovery after one week.</li>
    <li> This item always helps my skin during break outs and keeps my skin looking great. I would really reccomend this item</li>
    <li> My son uses this cream, and likes it. While the package and advertising emphasize the rapid action of the cream, promising to visibly reduce pimples in 4 hours, that may be a little exaggerated. Certainly this cream does go to work right away, and will dry up the area where it is applied quite quickly. But healing takes more time than 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is based on 10% benzoyl peroxide, the same ingredient many similar products use, and it&#x27;s hard to tell what else it contains that would work make it work any better than those similar products. The list of inactive ingredients is long and (to me) incomprehensible, and though Clearasil touts its \\&quot;Acceladerm technology [that] accelerates delivery of acne medication,\\&quot; I&#x27;m skeptical about it.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law tried this product and said the following -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I&#x27;ve used it 3 different nights.  The first two times, it cleared up the blemish by morning.  The third time it didn&#x27;t, but within 24 hours and a second application, it did.\\&quot; Later, she said, \\&quot;I liked it.  All products of this type have a bit of a smell, but this one, unlike some, didn&#x27;t smell after it was applied, which was nice.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like it actually works!</li>
    <li> As a consumer who is still searching for the best skin products for my skin-type and complexion, I decided to try this product from the Amazon Vine program.  While the product does work in fading and alleviating blemishes.  It did not work as fast as I would have liked it to.  However, and to be fair, the price is competitive and I would still purchase this product knowing that it works, just not instantaneously.  The more expensive products probably produce faster results, but my pocketbook is more favorable to this one.</li>
    <li> This product promises much but in my opinion delivers little.  My skin is very fair, sensitive, and it has been subject to acne and rosacea for 50 years.  At 65, my face still breaks out, so it was with high hopes that I tried the cream for two weeks, following the directions carefully.  The two positives are that the cream does work into the skin well and does dry out the affected areas and thereby takes down much of the swelling associated with acne.  However, there was absolutely no difference, rapid or otherwise, that I could see in the amount of redness in areas caused by pimples.  Over some days the redness eventually subsides, but in my case that is due to normal healing versus anything special by this cream.  The other thing I noticed is that this cream caused a fair amount of itching in the places where it was applied.  Unfortunately, on the basis of my experience, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Since I am not a teenager I don&#x27;t need to use this product on a regular basis, but every so often I get a little blemish, probably from my dog kissing me. Normally it takes several days to dry up and disappear, but one application of this and whamo -- it&#x27;s gone the next morning! So all I can say is: yippie! Definitely an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I will say that this works better with \\&quot;old age\\&quot; pimples than has anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  This will continue to be the treatment I turn to when necessary.</li>
    <li> My son says that this worked well for him. Not a miracle cure -- or maybe I should say it&#x27;s not an INSTANT cure -- but it did work, and it worked about the same as what I remember all those years ago with similar creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does go on non-greasy and it is very easy to use. Seems to make a difference within a day or so.</li>
    <li> I had bought this to try it after someone that my mom works with recommended it. I wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin or skin that is easily irritated. After using this product exactly as directed for about 3 days, it did visibly reduce my blemishes but it burned my skin extremely badly, I went to school looking like a strawberry I was so red. Also after discontinuing use of the project I had an allergic reaction to it, my eyes and cheeks got extremely puffy and I hadn&#x27;t used any other products as to not irritate my skin any more, as of now my skin is peeling off and it&#x27;s not even peeling in the areas I had applied it. My skin is so dry it feels like I have sand on my face.</li>
    <li> This seems to work great on helping to control a severe case of acne, it is not as drying as other things we have used.</li>
    <li> As an adult I don&#x27;t have to use acne treatments regularly anymore (face wash, daily treatment, etc.) but when I do have a strange breakout or something I tend to treat it with something like this product or the Proactiv version. I&#x27;ll be honest: The Proactiv version does work better/faster for me, but it is peroxide based-- the Proactiv one will bleach your clothes, sheets, pillow cases in wide swaths just from a few dabs of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve done is that I use the Proactiv product in the day time when my face isn&#x27;t touching anything, and at night I use this product because it does work, not as good as the Proactiv product, but this is also 1/4 the price of the Proactiv product. I touch up everything at night with this, don&#x27;t ruin my clothes or sheets or towels in the morning, then I apply the Proactiv peroxide based one for the day time. That combination saves me money, saves my sheets and seems to do a pretty good all around job at treating the occasional &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; that needs killed immediately.</li>
    <li> This product is a little thinner than other creams we&#x27;ve used, and does absorb into the skin a little better than others, with less residue. As far as its usefullness, it seems to produce similar results to other creams. It&#x27;s better than nothing, but not different enough from other products to warrant extra praise. Four stars because it does help.</li>
    <li> My daughter has recently started breaking out on her forehead.  We purchased $60 in Proactive products and it only slightly helped.  She was washing her face twice a day and other parts of her face were drying out and getting irritated.  When I saw this Clearasil, I decided to try it because it could be applied to just the problem area without affecting other areas.  Within two days (applying twice a day) this product had completely cleared her forehead up.  We are sold!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased Clearasil&#x27;s Ultra Rapid Action Vanishing Treatment Cream, because Clearasil&#x27;s older product, Daily Clear Vanishing Cream, which has been sold for decades under various names, was not available at any of my local stores. The \\&quot;Rapid Action\\&quot; cream was more expensive, so I hoped it would at least be a reasonable substitute for the Daily Clear. Both products come in 1-ounce tubes. Both contain 10% benzoyl peroxide, an anti-bacterial. The Rapid Action cream is supposed to reduce pimple size and redness \\&quot;in as little as 4 hours\\&quot;, because it incorporates \\&quot;Acceladerm technology\\&quot; that makes it penetrate skin faster. Daily Clear is now being marketed as a product that gives you \\&quot;24 hour control\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonsense in both cases. The difference between the two products, in practice, is that the Rapid Action Cream is thinner and runnier, more like a lotion than a cream. As a result, it is more difficult to confine it to a small area when rubbing it in. It is not liquid enough to absorb instantly and not thick enough to stay where I put it.  Benzoyl peroxide is far too drying to put all over my face. I only want it where I have a stubborn pimple. The Ultra Rapid Action Vanishing Treatment Cream also has a strange texture that leaves a film behind on my skin. So I prefer the Daily Clear Vanishing Cream. It is easier to apply to a spot. It&#x27;s far from perfect, but if I really need to dry a pimple out, it helps. And it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> 10% benzoyl peroxide is the strongest over the counter acne medication that you can buy, and it will clear a blemish, but, in my experience, the results will not be within a 4 hour time-frame. Additionally, after reading the Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Treatment Cream product description as well as all of the information on the box, I still do not know what \\&quot;Acceladerm Technology\\&quot; is other than a marketing phrase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Clearasil product is not the only product that has 10% benzoyl peroxide.  In fact, 10% benzoyl peroxide acne medications have been around for years, and you can find the same strength in a cheaper, generic brand product found in a large discount store.  Instructions for use &amp; warnings read the same on both containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between this Clearasil product and the generic product is that the generic product comes in a container that allows the product to dry out over a period of time. On the other hand, the Clearasil squeeze tube allows for easy dispensing and will keep the benzoyl peroxide moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clearasil squeeze tube is superior to the generic bottle, but is pricier than the generic. Given that the active ingredients are equal, the question then becomes which container you prefer to purchase.</li>
    <li> When you get older life plays another trick on you... adult pimples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a few small ones on my forehead from working (wearing a helmet when I grind, the strap traps dirt/sweat)&lt;br /&gt;I also get a pimple or two after I shave, around my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Typically the ones on my neck are red and painful, so when I saw the description:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Visibly reduces pimple size &amp; redness in as little as 4 hours\\&quot; I was like .. ok.. let&#x27;s see.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a toothpaste style tube, it is not watery or too thick. It is white and rubs in clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict? This stuff works! I noticed later that day (not sure if it was 4 hours later, but it WAS the same day),&lt;br /&gt;that the pimple on my neck wasn&#x27;t as red and it didn&#x27;t hurt so much. Two days later it was just about gone!&lt;br /&gt;I have since used it on my forehead, and same results.. nice clear skin. I didn&#x27;t notice any stinging/dryness from the product myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can ask is, where was stuff like this when I was a teenager? .. it really works! I would say give it a try for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
    <li> I am 43 years old with miserable cystic acne that has me in pain as well dealing with bouts of depression because I don&#x27;t want to deal with it anymore.  After an enormous golf ball size cyst made its way down my cheek and caused me a great deal of physical and mental pain for two weeks, nothing was helping.  i was putting bactroban and polysporin, only to make it greasier and imposssible to cover with makeup.  Out of desperation, I bought this 2 days ago and it has penetrated deep enough into the pimple to flake the skin around and dry it up considerably!!!! Finally, I feel some relief, and see a difference.  This is powerful medication for cysts and stubborn acne.  Do not use a blob, or spread it over your face.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product for serious acne that is deep in the skin.  Yes it burns, and turns the area red.  It also sloughs off skin to promote healing and drains out those fluid filled blind cysts.  Im totally fine with flaking skin around a blemish when it is promoting healing.  I can see this taking care of this monster cyst in four days max.</li>
