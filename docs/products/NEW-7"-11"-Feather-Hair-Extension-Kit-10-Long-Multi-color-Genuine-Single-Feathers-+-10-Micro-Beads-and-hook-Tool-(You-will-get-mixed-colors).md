      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Tool was easy to use with the hair and beads, it was my first time using the bead method, and it turned out great!</li>
      <li>i can say i had better</li>
      <li>It was okay</li>
      <li>you need more beads because youre going to be taking the feathers in and out of your hair.</li>
      <li>and I should have read more and did more research before buying this.</li>
      <li>but I thought there would be more extensions.</li>
      <li>but I was kinda upset it didn&#x27;t come with more beads..</li>
      <li>The picture shows more</li>
      <li>I order my feathers from Sexy Sparkles all the time.</li>
      <li>Our niece and neighbor&#x27;s daughter love this.  </li>
      <li>more than twice</li>
      <li>but i love the colors that was sent to me .</li>
      <li>GREAT QUALITY AND COLOR HIGHLY RECOMMEND&lt;</li>
      <li>and when i straightened it with my hair the feathers would break easily .</li>
      <li>Pretty nice on adults, too.  </li>
      <li>Came earlier than planned, which was really great.</li>
      <li>Based on the picture, I was excited to get this package.</li>
      <li>Nice vibrant colors and my 8 year old was thrilled.</li>
      <li>but they are cool.</li>
      <li>Other than that great for beginners to learn how to do them.</li>
      <li>theyre pretty, look good in all different lengths of hair, but, if you wash with them in, they will fade.</li>
      <li>the easiest to put in , but you get the right person to put that stuff in your hair and there it is.</li>
      <li>I liked this product alot the feathers were long ennough for my hair.</li>
      <li>:) They are also easy to install, but I recommend watching this video because the enclosed instructions were pretty minimal http://youtu.be/fQoEv__ovAk .</li>
      <li>Was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>they do blend pretty well, but if you try to reuse one</li>
      <li>and it came in pretty fast .</li>
      <li>its a good product the feathers and beads have good quality but the other thing that you pull your hair through with is poorly made and fell apart</li>
      <li>They are the real feathers not the satin ones.</li>
      <li>/&gt;THESES COST THIS MUCH FOR ONE IN A SALON&lt;br /&gt;LASTS</li>
      <li>This pack I got didn&#x27;t have too much color variation</li>
      <li>the feathers were a really cook color.</li>
      <li>Much thinner pieces in person than they look in the picture.</li>
      <li>The picture of the feathers is very deceitful.</li>
      <li>these are so much fun to add a little color to your hair with out dying it! :-)</li>
      <li>Was it worth my money maybe not but overall i really did like it</li>
      <li>this was one of the few kits that i could find that had everything included, with multiple colors, for a good price.</li>
      <li>So worth it especially for the price.</li>
      <li>NEW 7&amp;#34;-11&amp;#34; Feather Hair Extension Kit</li>
      <li>I bought these as a 13 year old girl&#x27;s birthday part favor.</li>
      <li>Now they look like &#x27;natural&#x27; feathers in her hair.</li>
      <li>i actually dyed one of mine with hair dye because it faded so much</li>
      <li>Also, I did have to buy my own tools, because I ordered two sets and both hook things were broken.</li>
      <li>10 Long Multi color Genuine Single Feathers + 10 Micro Beads &amp; hook Tool</li>
      <li>Also, the clamps loose their plastic inner circle very quickly, so I suggest order extra clamps.</li>
      <li>could have ordered a package  from a different seller that had 100 clamps, 50 feathers (that are alot nicer), and that came with the actual pliers tool for the same exact price as this pack.</li>

<ol>
    <li> good variety of colors and lengths</li>
    <li> this was one of the few kits that i could find that had everything included, with multiple colors, for a good price. i got them on time and everything. it took a few minutes to figure out how to work them in, but i got the hang of it. i did get different sizes and colors, some are big and puffy, some are long and skinny, some have stripes, and some are plain. theyre pretty, look good in all different lengths of hair, but, if you wash with them in, they will fade. i actually dyed one of mine with hair dye because it faded so much (ha).&lt;br /&gt;the beads come in colors to match blonde, brown, and black hair. they do blend pretty well, but if you try to reuse one more than twice it will break.... but theres a good amount in there. its lasted me a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;id reccomend this kit.</li>
    <li> NEW 7&amp;#34;-11&amp;#34; Feather Hair Extension Kit 10 Long Multi color Genuine Single Feathers + 10 Micro Beads &amp; hook Tool (You will get mixed colors)&lt;br /&gt;  FOR REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;not the easiest to put in , but you get the right person to put that stuff in your hair and there it is. just too difficult for me but they are cool.</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY AND COLOR HIGHLY RECOMMEND&lt;br /&gt;THESES COST THIS MUCH FOR ONE IN A SALON&lt;br /&gt;LASTS A LEAST 6 MONTHS IF NOT MORE</li>
    <li> I got this to put feathers in my nieces and my pets hair and it works nicely. Very easy to use and put in. The only problem I had is there were not enough of the beads to attach them. Other than that great for beginners to learn how to do them.</li>
    <li> I liked this product alot the feathers were long ennough for my hair. the feathers were a really cook color. The thing to put the beads in your hair withis good. theres just one problem. . .  there were only 10 beads. you need more beads because youre going to be taking the feathers in and out of your hair. it did not come with all the beads that the picture shows. and thats why i gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Everything was as expected. I bought these as a 13 year old girl&#x27;s birthday part favor. The girls and their mothers loved them! Very easy to use. I put 2 feathers in each bead, in each girls hair. I let the girls pick out the color combinations that they wanted. The party was Labor Day weekend, and all the feathers are still in the girls&#x27; hair. Good deal since it includes the beads, feathers, and hook.</li>
    <li> I order my feathers from Sexy Sparkles all the time. This pack I got didn&#x27;t have too much color variation but I still loved it. Also, the clamps loose their plastic inner circle very quickly, so I suggest order extra clamps.</li>
    <li> its a good product the feathers and beads have good quality but the other thing that you pull your hair through with is poorly made and fell apart i shoved it back together which wont stay long nothing gorilla glue wont fix</li>
    <li> LOVE THE FEATHERS!!! They are the real feathers not the satin ones. They gave a variety of colors which of love! Ands 10 beads and the hook!!! Recommend!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted these and they came in great shape. No disappointments! She has received many compliments on them, even some expressing jealousy for how expensive theirs were at the salon. :) They are also easy to install, but I recommend watching this video because the enclosed instructions were pretty minimal http://youtu.be/fQoEv__ovAk .</li>
    <li> Our niece and neighbor&#x27;s daughter love this.  Coolness factor off the scale.  Pretty nice on adults, too.  They can be washed a few times before they start to look a little beat.</li>
    <li> Came earlier than planned, which was really great. However, the packaging isn&#x27;t so great. I had to fish around for the beads. Also, I did have to buy my own tools, because I ordered two sets and both hook things were broken. (They should ask if you need them. Waste of supplies to send one with every package to the same house.) Anyways, I did buy more! So worth it especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Tool was easy to use with the hair and beads, it was my first time using the bead method, and it turned out great! Shipping was fast! Great quality all around of feathers too!</li>
    <li> The product is great but I thought there would be more extensions. The picture shows more but I guess when they say 10 they mean 10. I thought it just meant 10 different colors. The picture is deceiving.</li>
    <li> It was okay i can say i had better but i love the colors that was sent to me . It just wasn&#x27;t staying in my hair long enough and when i straightened it with my hair the feathers would break easily . Was it worth my money maybe not but overall i really did like it and it came in pretty fast .</li>
    <li> these are so much fun to add a little color to your hair with out dying it! :-)</li>
    <li> Beautiful, holds color I love them</li>
    <li> Much thinner pieces in person than they look in the picture.</li>
    <li> I like them but I was kinda upset it didn&#x27;t come with more beads.. Other then that I like them..</li>
    <li> Was exactly as described. Nice vibrant colors and my 8 year old was thrilled. I put these in at the beginning of the summer and they&#x27;ve stayed in through summer camps and lots of swimming. As expected, the colors did bleach out of the feathers, but this was after almost daily pool time. Now they look like &#x27;natural&#x27; feathers in her hair.</li>
    <li> Based on the picture, I was excited to get this package. I guess thats my fault and I should have read more and did more research before buying this. The picture of the feathers is very deceitful. The feathers in the photo look nice...However...I got some very low quality tiny little feathers, Some of the bases of them are SOO skinny and tiny I have no idea how they will even work in some of my clients hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have ordered a package  from a different seller that had 100 clamps, 50 feathers (that are alot nicer), and that came with the actual pliers tool for the same exact price as this pack. I am sorry for a bad review but this just sucks. I am incredibly unimpressed with what I ordered.</li>
    <li> The feathers themselves are perfect. The tool that was included in the kit, however, is junk.</li>
