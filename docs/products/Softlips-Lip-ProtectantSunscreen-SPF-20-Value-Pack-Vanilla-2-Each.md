<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got it at a heavy discount and love it....</li>
    <li> My favorite chap stick. Love these little sticks compared to the bulky cubes that Soft Lips changed over to. Glad I can still get them from somewhere. Great flavored. Not oily or wax feeling like some sticks.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever! Has a good taste when putting on and certainly softens my lips. It helps a lot because I bit my lips. Also, got 10 for $4. Steal.</li>
    <li> Great value, particularly if you don&#x27;t like the colored lip balm that often comes in the sets at the store.</li>
    <li> Have been using Softlips for years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. This is the best buy and bought thru this company before. I keep a tube of Softlips in my car, purse, golf cart, and every room in the house. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Great price, no longer seem to be in stores. Stock up price for sure.</li>
    <li> I had jaw surgery that left me w/o the sensory nerves to the chin/lower lip... forcing me to use chapstick. I have used a lot of different products, and this one definitely rates towards the bottom for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The applicator is REALLY small. And while it&#x27;s good that I don&#x27;t get this stuff all over my face since I can&#x27;t feel it when I apply the chapstick to the bottom lip, it takes multiple swipes to make it happen. Not THAT big of a deal, but who has lips THAT small? Children, maybe? Maybe this is a chapstick for children... not sure.&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;m in the tropics right now, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my other two chapstick types (Bronner&#x27;s and Eos) both last a lot longer in general. This one feels like when I was back in the States in the great north - constant application. :( That&#x27;s not good... and I find it ridiculous that when I&#x27;m in such a humid place that I need to apply as much as I do w/ softlips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately w/ the price of this stuff, I felt like I was getting a deal... but turns out that now I&#x27;m stuck w/ a lot of chapstick that just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I do seem to find that due to chemistry, some chapstick works well for some people and not for others. In this case, it does not work for me. Maybe it&#x27;s the perfect chapstick for other people (clearly that is the case due to the other reviews). I guess that what I&#x27;m saying is that I suggest that you check this out from the store first (one tube) and then go from there. Having a bunch of this stuff when you don&#x27;t like it kinda stinks. Unfortunately given that I don&#x27;t live in the States right now I had to give it shot un-tested. I should have just gone for the more expensive stuff that was already working for me. Live and learn, I guess...</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this lip balm, however due to problems with the applicator the balm stick often breaks off, or gets stuck in the top. I don&#x27;t think this is user error, as I have been very careful.</li>
    <li> When you can only get these one with a colored tint you don&#x27;t want in the stores, this is a great buy!</li>
    <li> These are hard to find where I live so I order them online as the only option I have, that should indicate my opinion of it.</li>
    <li> Love this product doesn&#x27;t leave your lips sticky</li>
    <li> Best chapstick ever. Not gunky. Doesn&#x27;t disappear.  I order this in bulk packaging. No lie.</li>
    <li> Easy to carry in pocket, goes on smooth, not waxy. Good SPF protection. Prevents and relieves chapping. Have used for years.</li>
    <li> Smooth, soft, feels glorious. Buying in bulk to make certain I don&#x27;t go without! Great for keeping your lips soft in all seasons :)</li>
    <li> Feels nice and cool on my lips, nice light vanilla scent. Slim tube, great for pockets!</li>
    <li> I am buying up a bunch of this because some stores are not carrying it anymore for some dumb reason. It is the best lip balm ever-light weight, long lasting, and great scents!</li>
    <li> Great lip balm.  My wife uses nothing else but Softlips.</li>
    <li> These are excellent lip balms, and shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> I order these constantly. It&#x27;s hard to find them in stores where I live. So this pack is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is great lip moisturizer and also helps heal chapped lips. Not to mention the very pleasant vanilla flavor/scent!!! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love soft lips, especially this vanilla flavor. It makes my lips tingle when I first put it on and it smells so good. I love this brand over all others. I think it works great and gets my chapped lips back to nice and soft in no time.</li>
    <li> This product is in stores, but its half the price! I knew what I was getting and I love it! Made a great stocking stuffer too :)</li>
    <li> These are my favourites, and I can&#x27;t find them in India. My family came to visit recently, so I was able to have them bring these along. They&#x27;re great for my lips, and they last for a long time, even with how much I use them.</li>
    <li> This is the only lip balm I like to use, because it&#x27;s not shiny like every other brand. Nice vanilla flavor, and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
    <li> I received this 2 days after ordering them right on time best chap stick for men i think if you don&#x27;t like having those shinny and wet lips they do add nice protection and softness makes your lips a little better looking. Great deal as well</li>
    <li> I purchased Softlips Lip Balm Protectant Value Pack, SPF 20, Vanilla, 2-Count 0.07-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 6) from Amazon. The product actually makes my dry/chapped lips worse. I know this because as soon as I switched to Carmex, my lips got better. When I switched back to Softlips they got worse again. I wrote to the manufacturer (The Mentholatum Company, USA), but they would only consider a remedy if I shipped the product to them within 30 days of purchase. I therefore would recommend avoiding this product. I will also be avoiding all other products made by this company due to the extremely outdated customer service policies (I know of no company that makes the consumer actually return the unused portion anymore. Wasn&#x27;t that from the 1970s?)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soft-lips balm since the winter of 2010 and my lips love them! Before, with other brands: chapstick, burt&#x27;s bees, even lip balms from Sephora, my lips would get so tired of them after a couple of weeks and would not retain any moisture. I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I love how portable the container is, I carry one in the car, another one in my makeup kit. My fiance also uses them (he loves these too) the vanilla scent is very soft, totally okay for guys and gals to use.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I have used often and could not find in the store any more.  Was glad to purchase it here and it was a great bargain.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and I still buy these in bulk. These are great for when you are running or doing other outdoor activities in the sun since they have SPF 20. They have a slight minty feel in the beginning and the vanilla flavor smells really good. Even my husband uses them!</li>
    <li> I have VERY dry lips, and I have a bad habit of licking them all the time to keep them from sticking together.   I have tried SO many different kinds of lip balm, but none have worked out. They all have seemed to be too solid and won&#x27;t apply smoothly.   Most of them have actually hurt my lips because I have to push so hard to apply.  SOFTLIPS IS A MIRACLE.  It glides on surprisingly smoothly, leaving lips hydrated and soft.  It also lasts for a long time, and has 20spf.  Whenever I have the urge to lick my lips, I put on softlips balm.  This is my all time favorite lip balm!!  I like to apply colored lip gloss after softlips balm, because my lips look magazine perfect.  I am so happy with this product and I love all of the flavors!! :)</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these anywhere in stores so these are a huge lifesaver!  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> This light smelling lip balm works quite well. It is the best I ever tried. I used to purchase 1 or 2 packages from Longs now CVS, but they no longer carry this product. So...now Amazon has my business once again.</li>
    <li> I just love this product! It does the job and is light and has no taste.  It feels like you used a lip gloss.</li>
    <li> The best lipbalm ever. Skinny packaging makes it easy to carry everywhere in the pocket. This product absorbs nicely into our lips with no stickiness or unwanted residue. A must have during winter. The only lip moisturising product that actually moisturises lips without robbing your bank account.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SUCH a fan of these beauties - they do wonders for my lips and I use them daily. Great flavor.</li>
    <li> This is the softest lip balm around, when it&#x27;s -5 outside it&#x27;s still soft and silky.  It&#x27;s a lot better than most other brands.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm, goes on very smooth, not tacky like chap stick.</li>
    <li> Softlips was received as advertised and packaging was in good condition.</li>
    <li> Tastes good and makes them lips soft.</li>
    <li> The best lip balm ever</li>
    <li> This stuff saves me all year round. I won&#x27;t use anything else! I always have it on me and in every room of my house, just in case.</li>
    <li> the soft balm protectant is way better than the chapstick that I been using. I would highly recommend this and the shipping on this was incredibly fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years, and it&#x27;s my all-around favorite lip balm. It glides on easily, and seems to last a good long time. I think it&#x27;s better than other more expensive lip balms (some a LOT more expensive). Love the stuff!</li>
    <li> Great lip balm.  Vanilla flavor is not overpowering.  Nice size to keep in your pocket.</li>
    <li> Nice protection in the winter for your lips.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t waxy. Stays put for a while. Nice fragrance. I have them in just about every coat pocket or drawer.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product, as all my friends did. I read the reviews on Amazon ans it sounded great. When I bought this, the price wasn&#x27;t awful and the lip balm contains we is nice and slim. However, the actual product was just ok. My lips are frequently chapped and my lips were nice and soft after using the softlips. Unfortunately, the taste was very chemically. I really did not like the taste. Overall, this is a pretty good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude, and I use Softlips.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite with SPF lip balms. It softens and makes my lips a bit slick, while adding the benefit of SPF. Also lasts for a few hours before I need to reapply.</li>
    <li> I like this product and buying in bulk is more cost efficient.  Plus because I live in the Midwest, we have pretty harsh winters and it seems like my clients appreciate receiving it.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this but my husband does and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I gave this product the full five stars simply because it is outstanding.  It is extremely moisturizing and does not come off easily with your first sip of coffee!  The light vanilla scent is refreshing as (in my opinion) there is nothing worse than having something with a medicinal odor on your lips.  I would highly recommend this lip balm to anyone who desires a moisturizing, long lasting product with the bonus of a fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years, love and will continue to order. We have them stashed all over...backpacks, car, purse, etc. and use regularly. Goes on silky smooth, softens our dry lips and vanilla smells yummy.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Will use for stocking stuffers!</li>
    <li> I randomly decided to buy this at a Walgreens one day (at about $4 a tube, this deal on Amazon is a BARGAIN!) and instantly fell in love.  My lips are soooo soft when I use this and it has SPF too, which is a great bonus.  I tried the other flavors from soft lips (Strawberry, and a holiday flavor) and they really don&#x27;t work as well as vanilla to make your lips baby soft.  They also seem to plump them out a tiny bit but maybe that&#x27;s just me.  Be careful though because this tube is tiny and skinny, like the size of a cigarette (and can be mistaken for one from far away, speaking from experience here) so you will find that you lose them a lot if you&#x27;re not careful where you place it.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever finished a tube before losing it lol.</li>
    <li> I love soft lips and I was so glad to be able to get it on Amazon. They do not have it in any of the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I just ordered the Softlips Lip Balm for the second time. I like it because it has no taste or scent but stays on a long time. I also like the skinny tube, because I keep it in a pocket. It&#x27;s a little thinner and longer than the other brands, so it doesn&#x27;t stick out so much.</li>
    <li> Soft lips is the only kind of chap stick I use. It goes on smooth, lasts a long time, and isn&#x27;t sticky and waxy like the other stuff. This will make the second time I have ordered it in bulk like this. I have shared the link with all of my friends and know of at least one person who is currently working her way through her stock pile. The only complaint I have is that they don&#x27;t sell every flavor in bulk.</li>
    <li> I tried to buy this in stores and it was always empty.  I love this product. It feels wonderful on my lips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using SoftLips exclusively for about the last 5 years. I live in Colorado, high altitude and VERY DRY. I keep it on pretty much all the time - have a tube in my pocket, purse, nightstand, desk at work, car, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also good for those who don&#x27;t want the mint flavor or the tinted that are currently being packaged with the vanilla in stores.</li>
    <li> I love Softlips Lip Balm. It works fantastically. It keeps my lips moisturized and soft for hours after use. It doesn&#x27;t drive out my lips like other lip balms do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just the best.  Love the sticks, hate the ball shape.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm EVER! Will buy it my whole life! There are much better prices here on amazon, and it&#x27;s worth stocking up on!</li>
    <li> Love this product and have used it for years.  Mfg. must have discontinued production of this because I can no longer find in stores.</li>
    <li> So great !!!!~Unlike other chap sticks this one glides on so easily and is very soft and softens lips alot  does not sting like carmex and glides on unlike chapstick.</li>
    <li> fast delivery and fair price</li>
    <li> These are my wife&#x27;s favorite lip balms. We cannot find them in the stores anymore so this pack should last her for eternity. (or a year or two, whichever comes first)</li>
    <li> Definitely does what it says. Softens and moisturizes lips with a fabulous and not extreme vanilla scent and flavor. Not sticky and has a little sheen to it, but just enough- not too much. PERFECT!!!</li>
    <li> Why else would I buy a whole bunch of this lip balm?  I love it!  So good it&#x27;s addicting~ careful!</li>
    <li> Great for dry lips; you want these to keep them from cracking! SPF is good too! It is a lighter coat which I prefer. (less viscous)</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s fav chap stick.  Only place can buy now.  Thanks</li>
    <li> My daughter is allergic to shea butter, coco butter &amp; beeswax so finding lip products for her has always been a challenge.  She LOVES this chapstick and it&#x27;s done wonders for her lips.  Would recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Chapstick .. I love how it feels , Smells amazing - Even my boyfriend asked what I use ... He liked it so much I bought him his own tube to avoid him stealing mine ! lol</li>
    <li> Works great and they were a great value! I bought enough for the whole family!</li>
    <li> The vanilla is nice, but I mainly love these because they allow me to carry an SPF 20 lip balm in my purse at all times without adding any unnecessary bulk or weight.</li>
