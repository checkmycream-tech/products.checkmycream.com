      <li>I ordered this dental guard after reading good reviews.</li>
      <li>Teeth Grinding, Medium, 1 each]] and perfected how to make it fit me the best.  </li>
      <li>It was more like a noodle, so I was amazed to go online and read great reviews for it.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and works perfect to keep my husband from ruining his teeth at night!</li>
      <li>Quite sexy!</li>
      <li>You heat it in hot water and then press your teeth into it to make a perfect mold for your mouth.</li>
      <li>Very highly recommend this excellent product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t like the kind you get from the doctor but helps in the interim.</li>
      <li>Good quality, GREAT price and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I tried the Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard with great success.  </li>
      <li>I have used The Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard appliance before and it was fine!</li>
      <li>I tried twice with this product to get the form fitting correctly and eventually gave up and threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;User</li>
      <li>OTC mouth guards are one of the most ineffective products.</li>
      <li>it felt like all the teeth on my top jaw were being squeezed together.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
      <li>It always stays in place, all night--no more headaches.  </li>
      <li>It is actually BETTER in quality than the flexible night guard I got from my dentist.</li>
      <li>so it now feels and fits much better.</li>
      <li>That was a shock to me after reading about many TMJ sufferers buying these things.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my teeth from clacking together, but does nothing at all to prevent the lower jaw from being misaligned with the top jaw, or to keep the teeth from coming too close together.</li>
      <li>Love the price.</li>
      <li>I love the product....</li>
      <li>Then you can see if it works for you, how you like it, what the fitting process is like, etc.</li>
      <li>I love it!!!!I</li>
      <li>better choice, in my opinion, is the Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard, which sells for around $25 all over the internet.  </li>
      <li>It worked a lot better that this newer version.</li>
      <li>and I got a great fit first time.  </li>
      <li>This is a good night guard at a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Teeth Grinding, Medium, 1 each]] is very comfortable (i.e. I don&#x27;t feel it), has no taste, is easily cleaned.</li>
      <li>Make sure you order \\&quot;The Classic\\&quot; or Advanced Comfort\\&quot; (one size fits all).</li>
      <li>I have had acrylic guards made to fit my teeth and that snapped into your top row.</li>
      <li>or I would bite right through while it&#x27;s warm.  </li>
      <li>I was able to get what I thought was a comfortable fit.  </li>
      <li>This night guard was easy to mode to my teeth</li>
      <li>but it was really easy</li>
      <li>The product fits well and was easy to mold.  </li>
      <li>It is true that it is somewhat bulky and that sometimes it takes more than one to get it done well, bu</li>
      <li>Then, when you have a fit, trim it so it isn&#x27;t too clunky in your mouth.</li>
      <li>I could not get this item to fit comfortably.  </li>
      <li>I trimmed the night guard to improve the fit</li>
      <li>husband prefers the somewhat bulky appearance of the night guard to the \\&quot;horrendous\\&quot; sound that</li>
      <li>Problem is, the instructions are TOO detailed.</li>
      <li>but make sure you&#x27;re getting the right size.</li>
      <li>The instructions are very detailed and must be done exactly as listed.</li>
      <li>first it was uncomfortable, but I took a good pair of strong scissors and trimmed it to fit great!</li>
      <li>I was worried about my vey cute husband being grossed out by how funny it makes me look</li>
      <li>However, if this is your first NightGuard purchase, I&#x27;d suggest getting this kind because it&#x27;s so much cheaper!  </li>
      <li>You are better of seeing a professional even if it costs more.</li>
      <li>original product in the blue box is good.  </li>
      <li>The box I got says \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; which is true for me.  </li>
      <li>it works MUCH BETTER than the one at the dentist office - which is adjusted by the assistant, not the dentist - and is also way much cheaper.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s possible this might be good for someone who needs to prevent clenching when awake, but, like I said, there&#x27;s no way this would stay in place in my mouth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far it fits perfect, I was even able to cut it to fit kind of only half of my teeth.</li>
      <li>I could TWICE and still could not get it to fit right.</li>
      <li>The instructions said to boil the guard for 50 seconds, let it cool for exactly 20 seconds and then fit.  </li>
      <li>It is so great to end the pain at such a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>The other thing is it takes a bit of practice to get a good fit.</li>
      <li>You must follow directions exactly as stated to get a correct fit for your mouth.  </li>
      <li>THe local Walmart in my area even stopped carrying this popular product, so I have decided to buy this product online.</li>
      <li>TMJ, I would say this product isn&#x27;t useful.  </li>
      <li>and I really cannot afford to spend more much.  </li>
      <li>Should be cut smaller to fit better</li>
      <li>The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Right night guard</li>
      <li>This is the older NightGuard (which must be why it&#x27;s so cheap).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Update after a few MONTHS of use - this product is amazing!</li>
      <li>Very small, maybe a good fit for 10 yr olds, not for adults.</li>
      <li>Items arrived exactly as pictured and described.</li>
      <li>First of all, it says in the instructions that it isn&#x27;t for jaw pain.  </li>
      <li>You might want to buy a pair and figure the first one is just practice.</li>
      <li>This is the first time in months, maybe years that I do not wake up with a toothache from clenching my jaws all night.</li>
      <li>First I replaced it with a 2-pack of Dentek dental guards.  </li>
      <li>On top of that, the cost of such night guard was U$ 340.</li>
      <li>It was my first time using a product for teeth grinding.  </li>
      <li>and I followed directions exactly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that the newer NightGuard (with less material around the front and more material towards the back) is more comfortable and lasts much longer.  </li>
      <li>My first night guard was custom made so the fit and finish was very good but very expensive.  </li>
      <li>before investing in the more expensive, more comfortable one.  </li>
      <li>The product in the blue box is no available but is a good product, comfortable and served the purpose.  </li>
      <li>But for some reason, I get more dry mouth.</li>
      <li>For some reason, I purchased the large.</li>
      <li>The size large worked for me.</li>
      <li>So far, they have made three of them without any success.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend the Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard!</li>
      <li>A much safer alternative to the over the counter variety in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>(You can&#x27;t really talk with this in).  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t keep it in my mouth for more than 30 sec.</li>
      <li>too much plastic.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready to drift off--it&#x27;s like a pacifier.  </li>
      <li>It really worked for me</li>
      <li>This product costs too much to be such a hassle to fit.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly as described and works perfect to keep my husband from ruining his teeth at night! It is larger than the others, so it will last longer.</li>
    <li> I was suffering headaches from a temporary increase in tooth grinding due to stress.  The product fits well and was easy to mold.  Unfortunately, I was able to grind through the hard material while sleeping rendering the product useless within 7 uses.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all. It had an awkward fit and I followed directions exactly. It was uncomfortable and I do not use it. It hurt my mouth to have it in.</li>
    <li> This is the crappiest mouth guard.  Highly uncomfortable, way too bulky and leave your mouth open at night.  It&#x27;s not that I bought the wrong size.  It&#x27;s a design issue.  Toss it to the trash can.</li>
    <li> It is practically the same as the pricey night guard I get from my dentist. This one is made of flexible plastic, but the occlusal surface is made of harder plastic - and it is hard and durable enough that after two months of use I have barely made a dent in it (I used another dental guard a few months ago [[ASIN:B000RX6TNC Grind Guard - Relieves Symptoms Associated with Teeth Grinding]], and after a month of use basically chewed it into pieces!). Doctor&#x27;s nightguard [[ASIN:B00006BSXM The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Dental Protector for Night Time Teeth Grinding, Medium, 1 each]] is very comfortable (i.e. I don&#x27;t feel it), has no taste, is easily cleaned. Very highly recommend this excellent product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after a few MONTHS of use - this product is amazing! It is still holding on. It is actually BETTER in quality than the flexible night guard I got from my dentist. Highly, highly recommend. I may purchase a couple extra ones myslef in case it goes off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend@</li>
    <li> Instructions were vague and not precise for a time line on what to do. Set up the different timers,i.e. 50 seconds in boiling water, channel side down, 20 seconds to cool then place in mouth to form...This was the vague part in the instructions. It mentions 30 seconds here and 20 seconds there, repeat as neccesary. It did not work! Do not purchase! POS and waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have used The Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard appliance before and it was fine! You put it in boiling water to soften it, then dip it in cold water for just a second to remove the surface hot water then put it in your mouth and press it with fingers to fit while SUCKING with your tongue pressed forward. You must HOLD that for about 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, hey... for about 5 years now I&#x27;ve bought similar appliances at Target/Walmart/K-mart stores for about $1.00 (yes, ONE dollar) in the sports section of the store. They&#x27;re intended for football players to wear (and maybe prize fighters?). You fit them exactly the same way as the Dr.&#x27;s Mouth Guard, and they cushion your teetch and prevent the upper and lower teeth from grinding against each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it was uncomfortable, but I took a good pair of strong scissors and trimmed it to fit great! It \\&quot;pops\\&quot; in, fits snugly, doesn&#x27;t fall out. It&#x27;s FINE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you have dental work done, like a new crown, you can re-shape or remold it again just as you did when it was new... or hell, just go spend one buck and buy a new one.</li>
    <li> This Night guard feels like your could swallow it in your sleep and choke to death.  I have had acrylic guards made to fit my teeth and that snapped into your top row. A much safer alternative to the over the counter variety in my opinion.  Be prepared to pay heavy for these. After bitng thru my acrylic guard over the course of a year or so of consistant use I decided to short the dentist and try one of these over the counter guards at a much reduced price. I found it was very hard to use and it floats around in your moutn and eventually to the back of your throat making sleeping with it a difficult if not impossible task.  Thats my .02 on this particular guard. I may try another brand before I succumb to going back to the dentist for another acrylic version but this one didnt seem like it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> Awful, awful, awful! I bought it to replace an old one I had professionally made for me by my dentist. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for a new \\&quot;proper\\&quot; one, but if this is my only option I&#x27;d rather spend the money. The one from the dentist fits on the lower teeth and fits INSIDE the mouth. This one fits on the upper teeth, doesn&#x27;t allow you to close your mouth and give you a buck-toothed appearance. Quite sexy!</li>
    <li> could not live without my night guard. Good quality, GREAT price and fast delivery. If you suffer from TMJ this is a great alternative to the denist&#x27;s $400 dollar version. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> This mouthguard is a great buy! I got it today in a size midium; it was too big for me, what I did, I cut it with a knife before putting it in the boiling water to mold it. So far it fits perfect, I was even able to cut it to fit kind of only half of my teeth. For the price, great!!! I give it five stars!!</li>
    <li> The bottom frame of this night guard is hard and flat.  It will hurt the lower teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original product in the blue box is good.  But this one in the pink box cannot be used.</li>
    <li> My dentist offered to make a mouth guard for $544....I read reviews on the Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard and decided to give it a try....No problems....I don&#x27;t have any problems wearing the guard....I love the product....Love the price. :o)</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;m really stressed, I grind my teeth, and sometimes I catch my cheeks between them and bite the inside of my mouth. This NightGuard has made my life a lot less painful, I&#x27;m very glad that I ordered this.</li>
    <li> I usually buy my night guard from an online source that does a good job with the same results as a dentist. I tried twice with this product to get the form fitting correctly and eventually gave up and threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;User error possible but I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very large, hard and clunky.  There was no way I could sleep with this in my mouth.  I couldn&#x27;t keep it in my mouth for more than 30 sec. without gagging.  If you have a small mouth, this won&#x27;t work well for you.  I will try one other brand before I shell out the big bucks at the dentist.</li>
    <li> I have been in agony over jaw clenching (not really grinding) I have done literally thousands of dollars damage to my teeth with this miserable problem and I really cannot afford to spend more much.  Since I am waiting for a dental implant to set in the bone on one side and I will have a new tooth in that space soon I did not want to pay my dentist another $250 for a guard that will have to be redone when my new teeth are in. I tried the Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard with great success.  I was really resistant because I did not think I could sleep with a big piece of plastic in my mouth. Wrong! I should have done this months ago.  The directions looked so complicated but it was really easy and I got a great fit first time.  The box I got says \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; which is true for me.  The instructions said to boil the guard for 50 seconds, let it cool for exactly 20 seconds and then fit.  I had no problem at all.  At first it felt way too big but after getting the suction right it fits great with no need to trim.  This is the first time in months, maybe years that I do not wake up with a toothache from clenching my jaws all night. I was worried about my vey cute husband being grossed out by how funny it makes me look but I just wait till he falls asleep to put it in. (You can&#x27;t really talk with this in).  It is so great to end the pain at such a reasonable price.  Go on and try this and quit suffering if you have grinding or clenching problems.  It really worked for me</li>
    <li> For some reason, I purchased the large. I probably should have gotten the medium. Unless, I was shipped the wrong item, of course I didn&#x27;t check. Anyway, I had to use a razor blade to cut away the access. Which there was plenty. But it works for what I need. But for some reason, I get more dry mouth. I had the old version of this with the peel off bottom. It worked a lot better that this newer version. But there is no choice, no one else had that feature. So it 20 something or you can get one from your dentist for 200 something.</li>
    <li> This is a good night guard at a very reasonable price.  My first night guard was custom made so the fit and finish was very good but very expensive.  This night guard was easy to mode to my teeth but it is very bulky and uncomfortable at first.  I trimmed the night guard to improve the fit so it now feels and fits much better.</li>
    <li> Due to grinding my teeth during sleep I now have arthritis of the jaw.  My dentist told me that she could make me a guard (which would cost $500).  When I flinched, she told me to get &amp;#34;Night Guard.&amp;#34;  I did.  You must follow directions exactly as stated to get a correct fit for your mouth.  It seems as if the guard might help.  I hope so.</li>
    <li> it works....but make sure you&#x27;re getting the right size. if not, you may not like how it feels when you put it on.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have been grinding my teeth for years (not all the time).  It was my first time using a product for teeth grinding.  I had a hard time keeping it in my mouth closed - I am not one to sleep with my mouth open - so needless to say I spent most of the night trying to close my mouth and trying not to drool! I guess if I gave it a chance, it would work. If I want to stop grinding my teeth then this is the price I have to pay, using a mouth gaurd.</li>
    <li> Not ready for prime time. Hard to fit to mouth. Turns yucky color after a few weeks. Ever sleep with a hockey puck in your mouth?</li>
    <li> I could not get this item to fit comfortably.  It is a poor substitute for dentist-made bite guards.</li>
    <li> This is the older NightGuard (which must be why it&#x27;s so cheap).  I&#x27;ve found that the newer NightGuard (with less material around the front and more material towards the back) is more comfortable and lasts much longer.  However, if this is your first NightGuard purchase, I&#x27;d suggest getting this kind because it&#x27;s so much cheaper!  Then you can see if it works for you, how you like it, what the fitting process is like, etc. before investing in the more expensive, more comfortable one.  Frankly, the only reason it makes a difference to me is because I&#x27;ve been wearing a NightGuard for years so I can tell a difference in the subtleties.  So in short, I&#x27;d take a newer NightGuard over this one, but this NightGuard over any other brand.</li>
    <li> It was incredibly uncomfortable to sleep with so didn&#x27;t really help with the night grinding problem.I wish I had saved my money.</li>
    <li> I have been at the dentist almost six months trying to get a night guard, but my experience was not good. So far, they have made three of them without any success. All of themstarted moving all my teeth and the biting started getting spoiled. On top of that, the cost of such night guard was U$ 340. I decided to give this one a try, and even though I had to try it twice, I finally could get the shape I needed. It is true that it is somewhat bulky and that sometimes it takes more than one to get it done well, bu it works MUCH BETTER than the one at the dentist office - which is adjusted by the assistant, not the dentist - and is also way much cheaper. It makes no sense at all to pay hundreds of dollars for just a piece of plastic that, as in my experience, does not work.</li>
    <li> These mouthguards work well for people who grind their teeth at night. However, a couple things you need to know. The size large worked for me. I am 5&#x27; 10\\&quot; and 150 pounds, not a large guy. The size small worked for my wife, who is small. The other thing is it takes a bit of practice to get a good fit. You aren&#x27;t likely to get it right the first time. You might want to buy a pair and figure the first one is just practice. Then, when you have a fit, trim it so it isn&#x27;t too clunky in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I bought this NightGuard b/c of the coupon online. The instructions are very detailed and must be done exactly as listed. Problem is, the instructions are TOO detailed. I followed the instructions best I could TWICE and still could not get it to fit right. This product costs too much to be such a hassle to fit. Thumbs down. I&#x27;m gonna take it back.</li>
    <li> Bought a few, tried several times and then threw them away. They are to complicate to use, a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this dental guard after reading good reviews. It was too big for me even though I ordered the med size. It is too bulky and hard even after boiling it. I tried cutting it down, but is still very uncomforable. Will not buy this one again.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Dental Protector For Night Time Teeth Grinding. I had used this device before &amp; was very happy with it. For this order, I was shipped the older version, which has a Blue Disposable Molded Tray attached to the bottom of the Protector.[[ASIN:B00006BSXN The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Dental Protector for Night Time Teeth Grinding, Large, 1 each]] The tray stops you from expending the Protector&#x27;s width or length. I have returned the unopened one for credit &amp; The Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard is shipping me a replacement for the one that would not fit. Make sure you order \\&quot;The Classic\\&quot; or Advanced Comfort\\&quot; (one size fits all).</li>
    <li> Save your money. OTC mouth guards are one of the most ineffective products. You are better of seeing a professional even if it costs more. I followed all instructions, but I was unable to get a good fit. It is a one size fits all solution...so expect some problems.</li>
    <li> too much plastic.  Should be cut smaller to fit better</li>
    <li> The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard lasted me for over a year before I decided to replace it.  I replaced it because it seemed gross to have a NightGuard that old, not because it wore out.  First I replaced it with a 2-pack of Dentek dental guards.  Each lasted about a week before completely falling apart.  I had to come back to this brand, even though I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought one 4 months ago (yes, I wanted to &#x27;save $$ too&#x27;); it came two in a pack. what a deal!  WRONG. The first one actually SPLIT upon its initial fitting - meaning, the top &amp; bottom layers  :(&lt;br /&gt;Had to use the 2nd one immediately. This one seemed to work out. NOPE. Weeks later the bottom layer split again! The package &#x27;warrantee&#x27; states 90 day satisfaction. I sent them a negative email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your $$</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 2002! I can&#x27;t sleep with out my mouth piece. I even grind my teeth during a short nap! Its pretty bad! I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it! I love it!!!!I started using it because in one year I grinded through 3 or 4 of the ones dentist made! I have a hard time finding this in drug stores.THe local Walmart in my area even stopped carrying this popular product, so I have decided to buy this product online.</li>
    <li> My first night guard was the really expensive one from the dentist.  It mysteriously disappeared one morning and I used a thicker, old-school whitening tray, until I could think of something else, because the one from the dentist just wouldn&#x27;t stay in, so I didn&#x27;t want to replace it.  I later discovered the Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard [[ASIN:B00006BSXM The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Dental Protector for Night Time Teeth Grinding, Medium, 1 each]] and perfected how to make it fit me the best.  They&#x27;ve since redesigned and I don&#x27;t like the new design as much[[ASIN:B000NLM1GW Doctors Nightguard Mouth Piece, Small - 1 Ea]] (ends up a bit bulkier feeling and less customizable), but I definitely prefer it to Splintek&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Splintek Sleep Right night guard and it is completely flimsy.  I knew the moment I took it out of the box that it wouldn&#x27;t stay in.  It was more like a noodle, so I was amazed to go online and read great reviews for it. I knew it wouldn&#x27;t  stay, once I&#x27;d go to asleep. The thin part in the front has no rigidity of its own(as it appears to in the photo) and just flops around.  There is nothing to prevent this from slipping to the outsides of the teeth, out of place or falling out of one&#x27;s mouth.  It&#x27;s possible this might be good for someone who needs to prevent clenching when awake, but, like I said, there&#x27;s no way this would stay in place in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better choice, in my opinion, is the Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard, which sells for around $25 all over the internet.  I&#x27;ve bought it at Walgreen&#x27;s for $24.99.  It comes in 3 different sizes.  It took me bit of practice to get it right, but the company will mail you a new one if you mess yours up.  I&#x27;ve seen some bad reviews for it--someone was appalled at the idea of sticking a boiling hot piece of rubber/plastic in their mouth and said they couldn&#x27;t make much of an impression, but I follow the boiling instructions exactly and, surprisingly enough, that one second in cold water(after boiling, per the instructions) makes it more tolerable to me than Latte or a cup of tea(which I can&#x27;t handle hot).&lt;br /&gt;Some tricks to help in making it...I pull off the blue thing(on the older one) and throw it out, before I start.  I just have to be extra careful to not bite using my teeth or I would bite right through while it&#x27;s warm.  I use my fingers to help form and also create suction using my mouth to form the sides.  Then, if there&#x27;s a lot of extra, I trim a bit and reboil for another 30 or 40 seconds, cool for one second by dunking in cold water and put it back in and create suction using my mouth and tongue to really form it to my teeth.  This might all sound really strange and complicated, but, in all, the whole process takes me about 15 minutes and I do it about every 6-8 months, when I chew through one.&lt;br /&gt;My husband prefers the somewhat bulky appearance of the night guard to the \\&quot;horrendous\\&quot; sound that my grinding makes(I have to believe him because I&#x27;ve never heard myself).  Plus, I put it on after the lights are out and I&#x27;m ready to drift off--it&#x27;s like a pacifier.  It always stays in place, all night--no more headaches.  I would highly recommend the Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard!</li>
    <li> The product shown and advertised is not the one sent and I see the incorrect picture is still posted on the website.  The product in the blue box is no available but is a good product, comfortable and served the purpose.  Unfortunately, the one sent, in the purple box, is supposed to be improved but did not work for me because the new material is too hard for my mouth and does not mold to my teeth as it should.  Very ,very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This mouth guard worked wonderfully. You heat it in hot water and then press your teeth into it to make a perfect mold for your mouth. It is a bit bulky but I didnt have to trim mine. Although if you need to it would be simple to do if you have a very small mouth. This device saved me alot of pain. After wearing it for just a couple of weeks when I slept I didnt have to wear it anymore on a regular basis. Now I only use if I start grinding my teeth badly.</li>
    <li> I got this for TMJ.  First of all, it says in the instructions that it isn&#x27;t for jaw pain.  That was a shock to me after reading about many TMJ sufferers buying these things.  I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot since I&#x27;d already bought the night guard anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fitting was difficult, but I expected that thanks to the many other helpful reviewers.  I was able to get what I thought was a comfortable fit.  When I tried to use it the night after I fitted it, I realised that it was just too tight - it felt like all the teeth on my top jaw were being squeezed together.  I refitted it a few more times, and never managed to get it to stop feeling too tight.  I am 5&#x27;4\\&quot;, so perhaps the mouth guard is too small.  Based on other reviews, however, I had concluded this would be the right size for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t fall out if I put it on all the way.  I do have a tendency to take it out when I am sleeping, and then find it somewhere in the bed in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For TMJ, I would say this product isn&#x27;t useful.  It keeps my teeth from clacking together, but does nothing at all to prevent the lower jaw from being misaligned with the top jaw, or to keep the teeth from coming too close together.</li>
    <li> From: Doug &amp; Colleen Riley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem molding the guard!!!  But it was so tight feeling that I could not get use to it, and I couldn&#x27;t sleep with it- I would just keep waking up!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week or longer I stopped trying!!! After being uncomfortable and sleep deprived!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps people that needs something for grinding and clinching etc!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I hope the Doctors and or another Company could get something not to tight and Comfortable!!!&lt;br /&gt;One star for your effert!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> Items arrived exactly as pictured and described. It works for what it needs to. Isn&#x27;t like the kind you get from the doctor but helps in the interim.</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied customer!!!! I have a teeth clenching problem while I sleep (and also during the day due to stress) and the mouth guard has worked wonders!! I am learning to relax my jaw and I no longer wake up in the morning in pain. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I tried three times to refit this dental protector to my bite, but it was too difficult. I plan on consulting my dentist.</li>
    <li> The instructions are very poor. I had to get on the internet to figure out how to do it.</li>
    <li> It sticks out too far in the front and does not allow me to close my mouth properly. 2 words</li>
    <li> I ordered med. size thinking I had an average mouth. Very small, maybe a good fit for 10 yr olds, not for adults. Order large or extra large.</li>
