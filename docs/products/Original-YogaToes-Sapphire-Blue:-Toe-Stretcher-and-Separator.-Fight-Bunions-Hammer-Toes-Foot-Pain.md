      <li>in all, these are an excellent product, and they have helped me immensely, with a side benefit of making my toes a little more aesthetically pleasing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, whether you have foot problems or just want to make your feet feel better!</li>
      <li>Hoping I got the right size for her.</li>
      <li>Seems pretty spendy for what they are</li>
      <li>I also see that my toe is not starting to turn in like I have seen many people develop over time.  </li>
      <li>I have size 5.5 feet and the extra small are perfect.  </li>
      <li>First, I have size 6.5</li>
      <li>Make sure you buy the size corresponding to your shoe size or they will be too big.  </li>
      <li>My toes feel and look better  (particularly my big toes</li>
      <li>You have to be consistent with usage but helps to straighten toes out after years of wearing flip flops.  </li>
      <li>I decided to wear them more often (almost at a constant when I&#x27;m at home and when I sleep).</li>
      <li>I get frequent toe/foot cramps and have mild bunions, so I was definitely interested in trying this</li>
      <li>It does help in muscle strengthening I think should be able to help my bunion in the long run.</li>
      <li>But most important, it&#x27;s definitely not my imagination that my little toes are beginning to straighten, and my feet are feeling better in general.  </li>
      <li>(they really arent, but I have some issues now that I dont dance).</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found much relief and improvement in my feet after using YogaToes.</li>
      <li>but I really wanted to feel relief for my aching feet, and this product didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
      <li>So far I love them and they really stretch out my toes from constant high heel wear.</li>
      <li>My big toe feels better after wearing these for brief periods.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend told me about these because she has a bad bunion and said they were wonderful, I am getting a bunion and decided to try a pair.  </li>
      <li>They are comfortable to wear around the house, for at least 15 minutes, and I make sure to move, stretch, and roll my feet and toes in all possible directions when I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>
      <li>But after a few months of wear, I absolutely love them.</li>
      <li>The first time I put them on, I barely felt anything.</li>
      <li>I started to see signs of a developing bunion on my right  big toe</li>
      <li>Easy to put on &amp; easy to clean just run under cold water &amp; let air dry.</li>
      <li>Most of my adult life I&#x27;ve been aware of a ridge of skin under my little toe where it presses into the next toe, but I didn&#x27;t know this was my foot accommodating and supporting all of the friction realized that my little toe was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is no question that YogaToes have been beneficial, even in the early stages of using them.&lt;br /&gt;(Just</li>
      <li>These are great for kicking back and stretching out tired feet and toes after a long day of shoe oppression.  </li>
      <li>and they have really helped with my minor foot aches.</li>
      <li>One of the selling points of these are straight toes, but if your toes are crooked above the joint, the yoga toes don&#x27;t reach.</li>
      <li>But its not that electric blue thats clear like ice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;YogaToes are designed to stretch the toes, provide greater circulation to the feet, and improve common foot conditions such as bunions, hammer toes, and other types of pain.</li>

<li> /&gt;YogaToes are designed to stretch the toes, provide greater circulation to the feet, and improve common foot conditions such as bunions, hammer toes, and other types of pain.</li>
<li> However, for those using the extra-small who are NOT getting enough of a stretch, sizing up to a small would certainly seem to make sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I could only wear the YogaToes for a few minutes the first couple of times due to the excruciating pain...  </li>
<li> I usually just put them on while I get ready for bed and wear them 15min</li>
<li> At first, I was only able to wear my YogaToes for a short period of time, and trying to walk in them was painful!</li>
<li> They sent me pink instead of blue.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been using these for less than two months, and so therefore only 4 stars at this point.  </li>
<li> I was in a low speed accident (on my bike, hit by a car) about a year ago, and I still have some trouble with the flexitiblity of my left foot.</li>

<li> Holy cow.</li>
<li> For some people, this may be preferable, and so I would recommend going a size down.  </li>

<li> Just started using few wks ago.</li>
<li> so foot discomfort is something I struggle with everyday.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened here</li>
<li> As a shoe size women&#x27;s 8 1/2, my correct Yoga Toes size is actually a SMALL.  </li>
<li> bought a small because I have a size 5 in womens</li>
<li> she usually experiences.</li>
<li> so don&#x27;t be fooled that they are hard plastic.  </li>
<li> I persevered, and now I look forward to my opportunity to put them on for at least an hour per day.  </li>
<li> At first they were very painful to wear, and it almost felt as though I doing something wrong to my feet---they&#x27;d never been stretched or used those muscles in that way.</li>
<li> Over the years my little toes have slowly curled under my foot to the point that it became incredibly painful to walk long distance.</li>
<li> When I get home, I realize that my feet hurt so badly that they are actually fatigued.</li>
<li> Walking--while a bit awkward due to the size of the YogaToes--is not at all painful.&lt;br</li>
<li> definitely awkward to walk around in them.</li>
<li> I was very skeptical of these.</li>
<li> Figured maybe my feet weren&#x27;t that bad</li>
<li> Im a ballet/pointe/jazz/hip hop dancer of 18 plus years... definately takes a toll on the tootsies :(.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these periodically for about a year now and they have really helped with my minor foot aches.</li>
    <li> Happy toes &#x3D; happy husband.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend told me about these because she has a bad bunion and said they were wonderful, I am getting a bunion and decided to try a pair.  While it won&#x27;t stop bunions from forming, it defenitely helps stretch the tendons in the foot and relieves the tightness, especially after wearing heels all day at work.  I used them nightly while I am in bed reading . Make sure you buy the size corresponding to your shoe size or they will be too big.  The are made from that squishy gel-like material so don&#x27;t be fooled that they are hard plastic.  All in all...very happy with my yoga toes.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t really feel much of a different while using YogaToes. I work in a hospital and and I&#x27;m constantly on my feet. When I get home, I realize that my feet hurt so badly that they are actually fatigued. I had hoped that this stretching tool would feel good for them. It said to try it out for a few minutes at a time. The first time I put them on, I barely felt anything. I was able to wear them without any feeling of stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a small because I have a size 5 in womens, so I believe I bought the correct size. I&#x27;m not sure what happened here but I really wanted to feel relief for my aching feet, and this product didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I was able to return them and there were no hassles at all.</li>
    <li> These were too small for me, but a gave them to a family member with smaller feet and she loves them. She is on her feet a lot at work and says these are great to relieve them aches and pains she usually experiences. I will be ordering a larger size for myself soon.</li>
    <li> Love how my feet feel after over a month of using this tool. I started to see signs of a developing bunion on my right  big toe and I feel like the pain has reduced due to using yoga toes. I also see that my toe is not starting to turn in like I have seen many people develop over time.  I like to use this tool when I get into bed at night after showering that way my feet muscles are relaxed and able to stretch. I highly recommend this tool for women who wear heals or are on their feet most of the day like I am. I&#x27;m a nurse so foot discomfort is something I struggle with everyday.</li>
    <li> Seems pretty spendy for what they are but I wanted to make sure I got the right ones. Who knows if the cheapies would work as well as I have heard these do. So far I love them and they really stretch out my toes from constant high heel wear. I will probably throw these in all my female friends and family&#x27;s stockings this Christmas. Great to put on while watching a movie or relaxing in the bath tub.</li>
    <li> You have to be consistent with usage but helps to straighten toes out after years of wearing flip flops.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My big toe feels better after wearing these for brief periods. definitely awkward to walk around in them. I usually just put them on while I get ready for bed and wear them 15min and that seems to be enough time.</li>
    <li> NOTE: I received a free sample of this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YogaToes are designed to stretch the toes, provide greater circulation to the feet, and improve common foot conditions such as bunions, hammer toes, and other types of pain. I get frequent toe/foot cramps and have mild bunions, so I was definitely interested in trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The YogaToes can be a little difficult to slip on, but dampening them helps significantly. (There is also a product available for this purpose, [[ASIN:B00GR9KWEW Yoga Toes Organic Purifying Spray]].) Once on, you can immediately feel your toes stretching. At first, I was only able to wear my YogaToes for a short period of time, and trying to walk in them was painful! However, my feet soon got used to them and even came to crave the stretch that they provide. Walking--while a bit awkward due to the size of the YogaToes--is not at all painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the right amount of stretch, be sure to use the chart and order based on your shoe size. As a shoe size women&#x27;s 8 1/2, my correct Yoga Toes size is actually a SMALL.  However, I was sent this size, EXTRA-SMALL, to try as well.  The extra-small definitely provided significantly less stretch.  For some people, this may be preferable, and so I would recommend going a size down.  However, for those using the extra-small who are NOT getting enough of a stretch, sizing up to a small would certainly seem to make sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, whether you have foot problems or just want to make your feet feel better!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of these. Im a ballet/pointe/jazz/hip hop dancer of 18 plus years... definately takes a toll on the tootsies :(. I put these on and didnt feel anything at all.  Figured maybe my feet weren&#x27;t that bad (they really arent, but I have some issues now that I dont dance). I decided to wear them more often (almost at a constant when I&#x27;m at home and when I sleep). Holy cow. They definately work lol. My toes feel and look better  (particularly my big toes, the slight bunion looks almost gone). Only reason why im giving it 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because the color is NOT even close to that. Yes its blue.  But its not that electric blue thats clear like ice.</li>
    <li> I wear a size 6 shoe and the X-small fits fine for that. It does help in muscle strengthening I think should be able to help my bunion in the long run.</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used to but seem to help. Still to soon to fully appreciate. Easy to wear and clean.</li>
    <li> Stretches feet nicely!</li>
    <li> I have Morton&#x27;s neuromas in both feet (I am a marathon runner).  I use it to stretch my feet (metatarsals).  I think it has helped me so I can run more often.</li>
    <li> These are great for kicking back and stretching out tired feet and toes after a long day of shoe oppression.  I have size 5.5 feet and the extra small are perfect.  My feet always feel liberated after 30 minutes or so with these on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using these for less than two months, and so therefore only 4 stars at this point.  I have a history of terrible foot problems and my small toes had recently started giving me pain when wearing shoes as they became more curved.  I could only wear the YogaToes for a few minutes the first couple of times due to the excruciating pain...  It was like torture, actually.  I persevered, and now I look forward to my opportunity to put them on for at least an hour per day.  I can now walk around with them on, too.  But most important, it&#x27;s definitely not my imagination that my little toes are beginning to straighten, and my feet are feeling better in general.  There is no question that YogaToes have been beneficial, even in the early stages of using them.&lt;br /&gt;(Just a tip... Rather than water, try using moisturizer or foot cream before putting them on. )</li>
    <li> I was in a low speed accident (on my bike, hit by a car) about a year ago, and I still have some trouble with the flexitiblity of my left foot. These have helped immensely! I&#x27;ve gained a wider range of motion wearing them once a day for a couple of months. My toes are also overlapping less, and have even straightened out a bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints about these are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) One of the selling points of these are straight toes, but if your toes are crooked above the joint, the yoga toes don&#x27;t reach. What I do is move up the separators slightly, and it seems to be working well. Its not in the directions to do this, though, which I find a bit odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) They sent me pink instead of blue. Boo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these are an excellent product, and they have helped me immensely, with a side benefit of making my toes a little more aesthetically pleasing.</li>
    <li> I love my yoga toes,so these are a gift for my sister. Hoping I got the right size for her.</li>
    <li> Over the years my little toes have slowly curled under my foot to the point that it became incredibly painful to walk long distance. After doing some research, I realized this was due to years of improper footwear and that my toes needed to be spread out and re-aligned. Most of my adult life I&#x27;ve been aware of a ridge of skin under my little toe where it presses into the next toe, but I didn&#x27;t know this was my foot accommodating and supporting all of the friction realized that my little toe was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found much relief and improvement in my feet after using YogaToes.

I&#x27;ve started wearing shoes with a wider toe box and have had to use salicylic acid and emery boards to file down the ridge on my toe.</li>
    <li> Helps stretch ligaments and muscles; feet feel better. Great to use for 45 minutes or so while relaxing on a sofa or bed while reading a book or watching tv. Easy to put on &amp; easy to clean just run under cold water &amp; let air dry.</li>
    <li> First, I have size 6.5 and they fit fine. On to my review...&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love the yoga toes. My doctor recommended them so I ordered them on amazon. It gave my toes a stretch, but nothing too noticeable. They did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> A great way to work on toe spacing while doing chores.  Toe spacer is easily washed to reuse again and again.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a size 7 shoe and these are perfect.</li>
    <li> Takes time and some effort to put on.  Just started using few wks ago. Remains to be seen if effective</li>
