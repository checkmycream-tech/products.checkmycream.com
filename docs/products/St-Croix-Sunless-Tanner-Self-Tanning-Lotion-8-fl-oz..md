### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great sunless tanner, no orange and no streaks!</li>
      <li>I use this tanner for the summers and it is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>The color on this self tanner is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>Excellent!  </li>
      <li>best thing about both products is that neither one of them streak.</li>
      <li>The tanner develops into this beautiful brown shade in about 4 hours...and stays put for about a week.</li>
      <li>so anyone with fair skin can expect equally impressive results!</li>
      <li>I bought this after reading many reviews &amp; deciding to go with the best ratings for the best price.</li>
      <li>I just know I&#x27;m not as happy as I thought I would be with this stuff.    </li>

      <li>and i love it!</li>

      <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better self tanner yet!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s kind of reddish orange.</li>

      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Overall a great product!!</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>a lotion but more of a syrup.</li>
      <li>It gives a gorgeous golden tan</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
      <li>This gives a better color than some drugstore tanning lotions.  </li>
      <li>I have used many many sunless tanners over the years</li>
      <li>First of all it came very quickly which made me happy.</li>
      <li>It gives you a beautiful natural looking tan with no nasty smell.  </li>
      <li>A great product would highly recommend.</li>

      <li>It looks like a very natural bronzer and looks great in photos.  </li>
      <li>It brings out a great natural looking tan every time.  </li>
      <li>and I do not tan easily in the sun</li>
      <li>And the fact that it&#x27;s tinted makes applying it so easy.</li>
      <li>but I found if I use a bit of body lotion during application, the tanner washes off easily.</li>
      <li>It also dries very quickly.</li>
      <li>Parabens ( Methylparaben, iosbuparaben, propylparaben, ect) are strongly linked to tumors and cancers.</li>
      <li>When I first used it, I really liked it.</li>
      <li>St. Croix sunless tanner is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Hands down the best self tanner out there!</li>
      <li>It immediately stains your skin so you can see exactly where you&#x27;ve put it on....which is great for legs but not so much for hands.</li>
      <li>Keeps my leg smooth and helps the tanner go on.</li>
      <li>I have decided not to make it my primary self tanner</li>
      <li>I really was hoping this product was a great find because I don&#x27;t get out much &amp; the convenience of having things I need shipped to my doorstep is a life saver.</li>
      <li>Excellent product and worth the money spent.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this product.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a  deep golden bronze that looks great.  </li>
      <li>The bronzer in it provides the skin with a nice color the first day, and the self-tanner in it leaves a nice color later.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s so easy to apply and dries right away.</li>
      <li>The color at application is rich chocolate brown and result on skin are golden brown.</li>
      <li>I put it on with quick circular motions and I get no streaking at all .  </li>
      <li>Not as drastic or as quick of a result as St.</li>
      <li>but it is my go-to lotion when I need a quick boost of color.</li>
      <li>I have used many self tanners, this product gives the skin a realistic tan color, not orange.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This one is a softer brown and I will probably use it mostly for tan maintenance in the winter (I live in Florida</li>
      <li>really great product, especially since it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
      <li>(I am very fair skinned), but bought it late in the season</li>
      <li>However I&#x27;m not crazy about the color it ended up being.</li>
      <li>and wanted this so my legs look the same color.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a nice brown tan color, will buy again.</li>
      <li>st. croix made me have a more natural tan.</li>
      <li>Quick tip ,please wear gloves as it will stain your hands very fast.</li>
      <li>Here is a BIG plus over other tanners - it smells WONDERFUL!</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, but you have to wear gloves when applying this because it is really dark.  </li>
      <li>The tips from other reviewers are good ones:</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, like almonds, has a thick and creamy feel, moisturizes and leaves a matte finish, no glitter or sparkles, very natural.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much for this.</li>
      <li>Tropez self tanners (but also no orange tint left over either), and is a lot better than any drugstore brand i&#x27;ve come across.     </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice too much MORE of a tan occur after several hours.</li>
      <li>Better to have moisterized skin, especially on knees, ankles, elbows.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t notice it at first</li>
      <li>I will definately order this again, and recommend it for a skin cancer survivor like myself trying to get a HOT tan without the sun&#x27;s rays.  </li>
      <li>I also put lotion on first, Then immediately put this tanner on.</li>
      <li>B0046VGPHQ Fake Bake Flawless, 6-Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Luckily a lot of it washes off BUT certain parts of my face really held on to the color even after exfoliating vigorously.</li>
      <li>(the color tends to absorb more quickly than other brands I&#x27;ve used) and 3.</li>
      <li>Another reviewer said the depth of color after you put it on is pretty much the result &amp; that is correct.</li>
      <li>When I put it on the first time I used way too much on my face before I went to bed and startled myself when I looked in the mirror in the morning.</li>
      <li>But I will be using this big time next season and plan to buy more!  </li>
      <li>Some streaks, hardly noticeable, all in all good product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This does the trick, very well.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great sunless tanner, no orange and no streaks!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best self tanner out there! Even prefer it over spray tanning!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading the reviews and can honestly say it exceeded my expectations. I have very fair skin, and this gave me better, more natural looking color than I&#x27;ve gotten from spa spray tans - even on my feet! The tips from other reviewers are good ones: 1. Use moisturizing lotion on knees, elbows, heels, etc. prior to application to achieve even results (those areas tend to be dry and absorb more color), 2. Use gloves - I didn&#x27;t do this and ended up with a lot of color on my palms that I had to literally scrub off (the color tends to absorb more quickly than other brands I&#x27;ve used) and 3. Wear dark clothing after application to avoid color transfer. One application lasted a full week, and it faded naturally without the usual patchy, ugly effect you can get from self tanners. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as orange as other products and it does make for a decent looking tan and i can even go over my knees lightly and it doesn&#x27;t make them orange like some will but why can&#x27;t it be made without parabens? If I had known that I would not have ordered it. Please make this without the nasty stuff so we can feel safe using it.</li>
    <li> St. Croix sunless tanner is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It was recommended to me by a friend. It gives a gorgeous golden tan...not orangey, not yellow.... It smells like cherries when you apply with no sunless tanner \\&quot;odor\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews and doing a little browsing, having never tried it before. First of all it came very quickly which made me happy. The lotion itself surprised me a little when I first dispensed it. It sort of reminded me of Hershey&#x27;s chocolate syrup because it&#x27;s extremely dark and not the consistency a lotion but more of a syrup. It has a pleasant smell to it almost like almond paste with a hint of coconut. When I put it on the first time I used way too much on my face before I went to bed and startled myself when I looked in the mirror in the morning. Luckily a lot of it washes off BUT certain parts of my face really held on to the color even after exfoliating vigorously. My palms and cuticles also turned an orange/tan color even though I washed them throughly. Lesson learned, I now know to use only a tiny amount at a time, use plastic gloves (or saran wrap in a pinch) and avoid my nose/mouth area for the most part. There is an instant tan because of the color of the lotion itself but after about 10 minutes I noticed that the color really starts to kick in. It does seem like about 50% of the color does wash off but it leaves a nice natural looking glow behind. I like this lotion but I don&#x27;t love it. I have decided not to make it my primary self tanner but it is my go-to lotion when I need a quick boost of color.</li>
    <li> Parabens ( Methylparaben, iosbuparaben, propylparaben, ect) are strongly linked to tumors and cancers. If this product contains phenoxyethanol as the preservative, why doesn&#x27;t the manufacturer remove the parabens ? Thousands of others have already done so.</li>
    <li> Way took dark, looks awful. Not good lotion. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> The color on this self tanner is the best I&#x27;ve ever had. Not orange at all. And the fact that it&#x27;s tinted makes applying it so easy. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month, and have applied it about 4 times. Never once have I had streaking. really great product, especially since it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t resist trying this product at such an affordable price! The tan it gives you works great when you first put it on. It looks like a very natural bronzer and looks great in photos.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face and body and i love it! My only qualm is that the tan that actually stays after you shower is actually very light and gradual.. which may be a good thing for some. I find that the more that you layer on, the deeper the end result. Not as drastic or as quick of a result as St.Tropez self tanners (but also no orange tint left over either), and is a lot better than any drugstore brand i&#x27;ve come across.     Definitely wear gloves when applying this, for some reason the palms of my hands tended to get darker than the areas that the tanner was being applied to.     Overall a great product!! I haven&#x27;t found a better self tanner yet!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading many reviews &amp; deciding to go with the best ratings for the best price. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I will probably never even use the rest of the bottle. I gave two stars for price, timeliness of delivery &amp; great smell. However I&#x27;m not crazy about the color it ended up being. It&#x27;s kind of reddish orange. It&#x27;s not the worst color outcome I&#x27;ve seen but definitely not the best either. Now it may be a different outcome on different skin tones so you may still want to try it. Another reviewer said the depth of color after you put it on is pretty much the result &amp; that is correct. But those issues all in all are not too bad. The worst part and the main reason I would probably never use this again is that it completely washed off the next day when I got a shower! I have used many many sunless tanners over the years &amp; I&#x27;ve never had this problem before. I used it properly, purposely didn&#x27;t take a shower until the next day &amp; did not use any type of exfoliating scrubber or body wash. I&#x27;m very picky when applying self tanner, its a whole process, exfoliating shower, using gloves &amp; a mitt &amp; applying carefully around knees, elbows, face &amp; feet so to have all my work literally go down the drain so soon was frustrating. The only way I would use this again is if I was completely out of my favorite sunless tanner and I had a last minute invite &amp; needed a little color asap. Honestly though I doubt I&#x27;d even use it then. I was hoping for a result closer to what I get with tanwise(which is very costly on Amazon) but at less of a cost but no such luck. I really was hoping this product was a great find because I don&#x27;t get out much &amp; the convenience of having things I need shipped to my doorstep is a life saver. Bottom line is people have different preferences so one may like a color or smell another doesn&#x27;t but if the product doesn&#x27;t stay on then there&#x27;s no point.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for the price. It leaves a nice color, the color lasts, and the product lasts!&lt;br /&gt;the only downside is that you need to wait awhile for it to dry..COMPLETELY, cuz even after you &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; it&#x27;s dry, it can still steak clothes.&lt;br /&gt;it won&#x27;t stain them, as long as you wash your clothes, but it will mark them for hte time being if you don&#x27;t wait long enough.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing , I absolutely love it.  It brings out a great natural looking tan every time.  There is no streaking no orange hue and no odor.  I use rubber gloves to apply .  I consistently get great compliments when using this tanner.  A great product would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have tried everything under the sun being so pale, but this is the first time I didn&#x27;t get any streaks, my elbows and knees didn&#x27;t look blotchy or weird and the color was nice. I will def buy again.</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  It gives you a beautiful natural looking tan with no nasty smell.  The color is amazing.  It leaves a  deep golden bronze that looks great.  I get comliments all the time when I wear it. People ask where I&#x27;ve been to for vacation. I put it on with quick circular motions and I get no streaking at all .  Quick tip ,please wear gloves as it will stain your hands very fast. Excellent product and worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> As long as your careful, you will always get a beautiful, natural tan.  It is brown and not orange.  If you want to keep a nice tan, realistically you&#x27;ll need to use the product three or four times a week - but it&#x27;s so easy to apply and dries right away.</li>
    <li> I have used many self tanners, this product gives the skin a realistic tan color, not orange.&lt;br /&gt;I work in my gardens a lot so I have tan face, arms etc. and wanted this so my legs look the same color.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a nice brown tan color, will buy again.</li>
    <li> This tanner turns me orange. Everybody&#x27;s skin might react differently to different products, but all of the sunless tanner&#x27;s I purchased on amazon.com have been inferior to the product&#x27;s website. A lot of fakes here, especially with Levi brand jeans.</li>
    <li> When I first used it, I really liked it. Especially because there was almost no smell! But, about the 3rd of 4th time I used it, the color just seemed orange.    I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t notice it at first or maybe I did something wrong the last couple of times, I don&#x27;t know. I just know I&#x27;m not as happy as I thought I would be with this stuff.    Not only that, but it has parabens in it, which is an automatic no-no for me. I was so excited to get it, and had saw that a few people online said that it was \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, so I didn&#x27;t even bother looking at the ingredients until after I used it. Kinda crappy that I couldn&#x27;t find the ingredients anywhere online either!    So, even if it had worked out for me, it would still be going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I am a St Croix Sunless tanner convert. The lotion itself is very smooth and easy to apply. It smells like coconut/almond oil! It immediately stains your skin so you can see exactly where you&#x27;ve put it on....which is great for legs but not so much for hands. Fortunately, two washes with soap will get your hands back to their natural color (or you could be smart, unlike me, and just use gloves). The tanner develops into this beautiful brown shade in about 4 hours...and stays put for about a week. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This gives a better color than some drugstore tanning lotions.  Also the smell of this one is not as bad as those.</li>
    <li> Love, love love this stuff. Can use it the day I want to be tan. And presto I&#x27;m tan. I didn&#x27;t even have to lay out this summer. Just put this stuff on my legs and the rest of me tanned enough without laying out. I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use a plastic glove to put it on though. I also put lotion on first, Then immediately put this tanner on. Keeps my leg smooth and helps the tanner go on.</li>
    <li> It all depends on how you put it on. Like most self tanners, It has that horrible smell, but I&#x27;m used to it so no big deal. I&#x27;d suggest using one coat because otherwise you&#x27;d look very orange. Some streaks, hardly noticeable, all in all good product.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Morrocan Tan and thought i&#x27;d try this out.  They both are about the same type of tanning.  I like St. Croix because it soaks in a little better.  The smell is pleasant, but you have to wear gloves when applying this because it is really dark.  I didn&#x27;t notice too much MORE of a tan occur after several hours. You get what you see when applying initially.  I will definately order this again, and recommend it for a skin cancer survivor like myself trying to get a HOT tan without the sun&#x27;s rays.  Thank you very much for this.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best self tanner I have ever used! The only downside is the staining of your hands (even if you scrub right after), but is still very much worth it, looks so natural, and no major smell! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> By far the best self tanner ever!!!</li>
    <li> so this is one of the lotions i have tried and thought i did not like until i realized sun labs made me orange and st. croix made me have a more natural tan. the only thing i do not like is after about an hour the smell smells like the ones that are cheap from wal-mart and also the a lot of the color comes off the next day but i rather look natural than orange.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on my tan - no orange coloring. Better to have moisterized skin, especially on knees, ankles, elbows.</li>
    <li> loved it, I look different in few hours, people noticed that, keep asking my if I have been going to the beach</li>
    <li> I am a big self-tan product user, but I use products under $10, not the higher priced ones.  However, this one was in my price range so I tried it.  Excellent!  Dries fast, and goes on well, though you should use some gloves as it will take several hand washings to get it off the palms. The bronzer in it provides the skin with a nice color the first day, and the self-tanner in it leaves a nice color later.  I imagine I could get very dark with regular use of this (I am very fair skinned), but bought it late in the season so I am using up some of my older products before heading into winter. But I will be using this big time next season and plan to buy more!  Here is a BIG plus over other tanners - it smells WONDERFUL! Like chocolate cherries! Finding a good smell in low priced self-tanners is hard to do, (usually just hope for tolerable) but this one is GREAT from the moment it comes out of the bottle until it dries.  Try it!!</li>
    <li> I would say a great self tanner, but be careful as it can look a little orange or fake if you dont reeeeally pay attention to your application. Also, before you start, have exfoliating soap ready as it will be difficult to remove from hands. I would look into one of those tanning mit things.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. I use it and Fake Bake depending on how much color I want at that particular moment. This one is a softer brown and I will probably use it mostly for tan maintenance in the winter (I live in Florida so we wear shorts and bathing suits year round.)&lt;br /&gt;I started using the two products this summer.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely fair and have had skin cancer so I can&#x27;t tan. This does the trick, very well.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about both products is that neither one of them streak. I use the mitt from the Fake Bake to spread this one. [[ASIN:B0046VGPHQ Fake Bake Flawless, 6-Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;The St Croix is a lotion so it helps hydrate my skin as well as tanning it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is IDENTICAL to Sun Self Tanning Lotion in many respects but costs significantly less. Application color, consistency, lotion quality, and end results are the same -- the only difference is that Sun smells like cherries and St Croix doesn&#x27;t really have a scent. The color at application is rich chocolate brown and result on skin are golden brown. No trace of orange as is often the case with sunless tanning lotions. (My skin is naturally light to pale and I do not tan easily in the sun so anyone with fair skin can expect equally impressive results! ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality product at a great price. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product.  I put it on and instantly saw the color change, which I was excited about. I forgot a little spot on the side of my nose, and it covered up just fine without streaks.  However, after having the product on for about 4 hours, I looked in the mirror and it looked terrible. It wasn&#x27;t streaked, but the color was brown. I looked like I was out playing in the dirt for 10 hours. The back of the bottle says it is okay to apply to your face, and my skin is not, by any means, sensitive, but I broke out terribly. EVERYWHERE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used an acne (Stridex) pad to remove the stuff, and I didn&#x27;t look \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; anymore and the color was good. However, after I showered the next morning, it washed off completely. I would keep reapplying with my daily routine if it didn&#x27;t make me break out so bad. :-(</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews of this product and decided to order it.  The reviews are accurate and this lotion does a wonderful job in giving the skin a bronzed glow.</li>
    <li> I use this tanner for the summers and it is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve tried. It smells wonderful, like almonds, has a thick and creamy feel, moisturizes and leaves a matte finish, no glitter or sparkles, very natural. It is difficult to wash off hands, it takes two times or so but I found if I use a bit of body lotion during application, the tanner washes off easily. It also dries very quickly.</li>
