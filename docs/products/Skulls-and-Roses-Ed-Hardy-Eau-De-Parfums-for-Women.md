<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Daughter will love for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Great price</li>
    <li> Not only did I get my package for forty dollars off the original price but it got to me in three days with priority mail. I am super happy with this purchase. I also got a ten percent off coupon fir my next purchase. I will definitely be purchasing more from this company. And the prime smells amazing. I am in love.</li>
    <li> women  and  I  love  this perfume</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS! Smells great and I always get compliments. Last long and is a great product. Great for christmas presents for any girl! It has more of a mature smell but I would recommend for ages 14+</li>
    <li> I ordered this without ever smelling it. I really like this scent and I love the cheesy bottle. It&#x27;s soft, feminine and a bit sweet.  However, I do think it smells a bit like shampoo or conditioner- not a horrible thing but that just means that it&#x27;s not the most elegant scent. Therefore, I would suggest this for persons (whatever your age, but leaning toward the very young crowd) who are looking for a light, flirty, daytime, casual scent. stayed close to my skin when I wore it. I smelled it at the end of the day, however, I don&#x27;t think others could.  The shipping was prompt and everything arrived in tact.</li>
    <li> This perfume is my new obsession. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> love the perfume and great value</li>
    <li> Sweet powdery scent, a hint of cotton candyish but not that annoying. I don&#x27;t feel it last very long. I have received a few compliments at work.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems w/ the scent of this parfum, would probably order it again</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my girlfriend. She generally doesn&#x27;t like perfume, but Ed Hardy&#x27;s Skulls and Roses is different for her. She loves it! and She adores the bottle with the rose in the mouth. Got here perfectly on time as well, so thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Everyone I encounter loves this perfume</li>
    <li> Perfect scent for me. Love the packaging! Getting compliments on the first day!</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than the packaging was good, shipping was fast, and the product is perfect! Smells great and lasts a long time. It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s new favorite and I don&#x27;t mind! Coming from a man, the bottle is cool! It would be cool if they had an even larger bottle too.</li>
    <li> smells good and was delivered within a decent amount of time. I just wish it was like Beautiful  and the smell last a very long time.  I work two jobs and by the time I get to my second job the scent is gone and this bottle is to big to carry around at least for me.  I guess I will have to buy a purse size bottle also or one of those gift packs</li>
    <li> The price was great considering the cost was so much more in the stores. I love the skull bottle and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> I liked it so much I got an extra one. Smells really good and a lot of people asked me about it.</li>
    <li> Unique smell for me. Not something my other girlfriends are wearing. My husband loves it on me. Definitely a keeper</li>
    <li> It came in the mail quickly, in less time than expected. I love its citrusy sweet scent. I always get a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> One of my new favorites.  If you like other Ed Hardy perfumes, you&#x27;ll love this.  Not too strong but lasts all day.  Reminds me a lot of the pink bottle Ed Hardy perfume - very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Great perfume...delivered in great shape. Absolutely love the smell</li>
    <li> Very large bottle for the price.  New fragrance that smells so sexy on my girlfriend she wears it almost every day</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  This is one of those perfumes that you smell when a woman walks by and you get a hint of it and you think &amp;#34;Wow, what is that stuff??&amp;#34;  and then you never ask because that would be kinda weird.  This perfume I smelled in the store at Buckle and I instantly loved it.  It has the perfect scent with a little bit of a fruit smell to it.  I bought it for my wife and I love when she wears it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this without smelling it first, and was not disappointed! It came way quicker than I thought it would, and was pretty cheap for the amount. When I first spray it I kind of smell a tea-like smell, it is just slightly fresh garden-y scented, with a bit of sweetness. I wore this to bed and when I woke up I could still smell it and it reminded me of a shampoo I have used before. It is really nice!</li>
    <li> The smell is not too overwhelming. It&#x27;s perfectly sweet. Very distinct. Plus, the cool skull design really stands out! T</li>
    <li> my lady friend loves it and I really like the scent myself. I got it for her as a gift. I tried it because it had so many good reviews from woman. delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Although i feel Ed Hardy is washed up. This perfume is top notch. get it while it last..its smells up the the best ones....Oh and the price here on Amazon is competitive to what you would pay in a store.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!!! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I paid half of the price buying this on Amazon as a gift for my wife! Got it pretty quick as well!</li>
    <li> I have always worn the &amp;#34;Lucky Brand&amp;#34; perfume.  I&#x27;m a daily perfume wearer and while I loved the smell of &amp;#34;Lucky,&amp;#34; it would fade quickly.  I remembered a friend had bought the Skulls and Roses perfume a few months back and it smelled absolutely fantastic.  When I ran out  of my &amp;#34;Lucky&amp;#34; perfume, I decided I&#x27;d sort of venture out and buy the Skulls and Roses.  Of course, I bought it on Amazon...my favorite way to shop.  Anyway, I totally love it!  It&#x27;s a nice, classy fragrance that is not too overpowering, but doesn&#x27;t fade quickly.  It has sort of a florally/fruity flare.  My new fav, for sure!</li>
    <li> Originally my sister bought this and I fell in love. It smells so good, it&#x27;s hard to describe a perfume though. It&#x27;s long lasting and the shipping was quite fast, I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> What a great design and fragrance. So excited to have found this product online, the store only had ones that were not as intricate as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lori</li>
    <li> I found this at Target and loved it. Then I couldn&#x27;t find it again. Love this perfume! The seller FragranceNet was quick and I was very pleasantly surprised it was a gift set not just the perfume.</li>
    <li> I like the wife doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite Ed Hardy perfume. I always get complimented on how good I smell whenever I have it on. I love the bottle, it&#x27;s really perfect for the name. I am now loyal to Skull and Roses as my favorite scent!</li>
    <li> It was perfect and for the best price. It was the gift set not just the perfume.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Smells wonderful. Will definitely be ordering more when I run out</li>
    <li> same Ed Hardy as sold at Macy&#x27;s for twice the price---excellent value and good product</li>
    <li> When I smell this perfume. I had to order another that&#x27;s how Good this smell ladies</li>
    <li> My 17 year daughter loves it and the best price I found too.</li>
    <li> It got to my sister in a timely manner, &amp; she was more than thrilled with it!  I was A-listed this year!  She&#x27;d been wanting it since it came out (unbeknownst to me). We have very similar taste in perfume, so I was hoping it&#x27;d be a good pick...&amp; it was a great one! Thanks</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes at an unbeatable price!</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> Perfect, smells great and for the price was a good deal.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!!</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne for a good price</li>
    <li> Wow first off I did not pay shipping and I was expecting to get this in another week, showed up in 4 days ! Thank you Amazon. It&#x27;s always best before you buy a perfume to go to a Macy&#x27;s, sephora, ect.. And find a scent you like! It smells amazing and I love it. Anything by Ed Hardy is phenomenal.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations!  Arrived quickly and exactly what we wanted.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS ITEM!!!!!! my friend had it and when i first smelt it i knew i wanted it. when i cam over to america i was so excited to buy stuff online but i was warned to be carful. i found this product and when i got it i fell in love with it &gt;XD it&#x27;s smells exactly the same so i know it&#x27;s the REAL THING!!!</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance.  Like the skull bottle.</li>
    <li> The thing I love about Ed Hardy Perfumes is the fact they do well on most peoples skin. I purchase this without even smelling it so I said to myself I&#x27;ll take the chance and hopefully I&#x27;ll like it and it is what I expected. Then again the cologne smells amazing so I&#x27;ll admit the cologne is great and doesn&#x27;t wear off. My hubby wears it sometimes and smells so good on him, but keep in mind he didn&#x27;t purchase here he bought his at a retail store. Anyway the perfume was way too soft it would fade away on me  very fast I hardly smell anything on me. It could be me or is it a fake, but at least I&#x27;ve been told I do smell good so that is why I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars. I guess what really counts is that you don&#x27;t smell like crap and people can smell your scent, but sometimes we want to be able to smell ourselves for a while is all I&#x27;m saying.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for myself and I absolutely love it and would highly recommend buying this product and the men&#x27;s is really nice to</li>
    <li> I ordered this fragrance a couple months ago and absolutely LOVE LOVE it. I get so many compliments on the smell and so many people have asked me what I&#x27;m wearing. Even after I&#x27;ve had it on more than my 8 hr work day, it&#x27;s still smells as fresh as if I had just put it on that morning. And the price, it was great. I&#x27;ve seen it priced much, much higher in the department stores. You can not go wrong with this fragrance ladies. MEN, I promise if you purchase this for your woman, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this item.  The fragrance is amazing--fruity, floral, with deep woodsy notes.  The bottle is one to be displayed.  The price on Amazon is the best.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it and wears it every day and i love it too, we also have matching ones so its even better</li>
    <li> I first noticed this at Macy&#x27;s and fell in love with the scent and the skull bottle, but they wanted $70. I don&#x27;t like wasting money, so I decided not to buy this at the store and later looked it up online. When I found it here on Amazon, I was shocked to see it listed for half the price and for free shipping. So I ordered it thinking maybe the one I saw at Macy&#x27;s was a bigger bottle and that&#x27;s why it costs so much. Wrong..... it&#x27;s the same exact size!!!  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy it when I first saw it in the store because I would have been soo pissed that I paid double. So now when I see something I like and it&#x27;s a bit pricey, I double check online to see if I can find it cheaper. There is no sense in paying double for items when Amazon has the same exact items for way less money.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this. Not too over powering either.I bought the men&#x27;s one for my boyfriend and smells really good on him as well.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites :)</li>
    <li> This perfume is amazing. I love how it is both sweet and seductive at the same time, not overpowering. I would definitely recamend this product to someone wanting to try something new.</li>
    <li> The size and cost compared to buying this perfume in stores is absurd. It was such a relief to find this product here because it was not only cheaper but also can be purchased in a larger quantity. The smell is absolutely delightful, and I find one spritz to be enough. Great for young women looking for a more mature smell. The perfume bottle is a skull, the rose attached to the mouth is removable making it slightly more convenient to store. The perfume package also came with various samples and coupons.</li>
    <li> Not long lasting but its a nice smell</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and so does my wife :)</li>
    <li> This was just the perfume my daughter asked for.  I was easily able to locate and purchase it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance bought it for my mom she loves ed hardy has all his fragrances saw it in Macy&#x27;s for twice as much as I bought it for thanks amazon I am now sold as a customer!</li>
    <li> Shipping took a little longer than expected but the perfume is great!</li>
    <li> My favorite smell! And love the cool bottle that it comes in!!! Ed hardy is by far my favorite !!!</li>
    <li> Loved it arrived early</li>
    <li> Smells great and cute packaging. The top of the skull comes off and there is a spray button to spray the perfume. I use to wear &amp;#34;Lucky You&amp;#34; by Calvin Klein and this is much better smelling. Sweet but not over powering.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of all of the Ed Hardy perfumes, and this one is no exception. And I can&#x27;t get over the skull container top. It scares my husband and I love that too. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The scent is alluring and feminine. I could still smell its luxurious scent after a full day of work. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> this was a great find here. such an awesome price. so much better than department stores. got this for my teenage daughter she loves it.</li>
    <li> Good price and came in on time.</li>
    <li> Smells Heavenly! Love the entire Ed Hardy line!</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law. She loves this and thought the container was awesome. Great price and Free S&amp;H. Wow!!  :)</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance, because I AM A FAN OF SWEET SMELLS. What I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t stay for too long. There are fragrances out there that last 24 hrs +. This one fades in about 6 hrs after using. I do not recommend if you are like me and work all day and want to smell nice and clean without having to have it in your pocket.</li>
    <li> Fruity, a bit of flower, pretty scent.  It&#x27;s different than I expected.  Quite nice.  Worth buying for the cool container, since it smells good.  But I agree that doesn&#x27;t have the best staying power.  It fades off fast.</li>
    <li> So funny- this came as a set with body wash and lotion and small purse sz bottle but it didn&#x27;t say that, and I was expecting only one 3.4 oz bottle of cologne.  The cologne comes in this skull as it is pictured here and on the box.  I thought the skull was a decoration and I hadn&#x27;t received the 3.4 oz bottle.  Went online to return it and Amazon said it was hazardous and could not be returned. (uh, they just mailed it to me).  Anyway, after looking at the package again I realized I got what I had ordered and more.  Smells very good, lotion, body wash and spray. Feel a little silly spraying from a skull, marketed more towards youngsters, I guess.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancee for Christmas. She loves this perfume. A rose is her favorite flower and for some reason she likes skulls. But the perfume smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be weary though, amazon prime will ship this for free but it won&#x27;t ship it in two days. It has something to do with the chemicals in the product.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t what was stated. This seller isn&#x27;t selling the real Eau De Parfum. It may have the sticker but it isn&#x27;t. I put this perfume on, 20 minutes later you can hardly smell it. I have worn Ed Hardy for 5 years, never, ever have I had this problem, so beware, the price looks good but it&#x27;s not real!</li>
    <li> Awesome! My lady loved it. Perfect gift. She loves skulls, roses, and Ed Hardy.  I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this one. And the scent, well I fall more madly in love every time she puts it on. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Product as described and delivered in a timely fashion at a great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not able to wear a lot of perfumes. There is just something in them I am allergic to. But a couple years ago I came across this perfume that had such a subtle sweetness that lasted a lot longer than most perfumes I had been able to wear before. It smells a bit like strawberries on a warm summer day, it also has a hint of honeysuckle which is a favorite scent of mine from childhood. I love this perfume and recommend it to women who want a feminine scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Every time!</li>
    <li> I love this product... I get tons of compliments on the way I smell when I put this on. It lasts a long time and i am just in love with it!</li>
