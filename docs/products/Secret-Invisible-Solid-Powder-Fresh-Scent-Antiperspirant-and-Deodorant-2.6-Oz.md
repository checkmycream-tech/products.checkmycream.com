      <li>but right now they are not at all.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from Right Guard, Arm and Hammer, Degree, and Speed Stick.</li>
      <li>Not to mention, it works very well and smells fresh even after an intense workout full of lifting and HIIT intervals at the gym!</li>
      <li>but I loved  Shower Fresh (also by Secret) more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well! I have been using this for years.</li>
    <li> I will never purchase this deoderant again.</li>
    <li> Deodorant is deodorant.  It&#x27;s hard to rave about such a product.  This works as it should.  Best to purchase from Amazon to get the best prices on these essentials!</li>
    <li> Big Mama used it and she told me the next time to go back to Dove. But she has been known to be a creature of habits and sometimes she will refuse to accept alternatives. I do not endorse that sentiment. Most of the times for I do believe competition is what makes our capitalistic system shine and single out the best from the rest. So I am giving this one 3 stars based entirely on the fact that it was not requested again for future use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble looking for a deodorant that is right for me ever since I&#x27;ve needed to use it. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Right Guard, Arm and Hammer, Degree, and Speed Stick. Some of these worked, and smelled great, but I found myself re-applying often.    I was told by my mother once, when I ran out of my own deodorant, to try some of her Secret. I didn&#x27;t try it because I&#x27;m a male and I didn&#x27;t want to smell like flowers all day long. I finally ended up trying some at my girlfriends house when I left my deodorant at home. My mother was completely right! The deodorant worked great and I only had to put it on once.    I finally got the idea to purchase my own Secret deodorant while I was on deployment. I was getting sick of going back to my locker and putting on more deodorant. I ordered some Secret because of my experience with it in the past. Ever since I&#x27;ve gotten it about a month and a half ago, I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day. This stuff works great. I am no longer inconvenienced with going out of my way to apply more deodorant and I don&#x27;t have to check my underarms to see if I&#x27;m starting to smell either!    Overall, this stuff is great. For anyone who has had trouble finding the right deodorant, give some Secret a shot.</li>
    <li> works great, smells great, and priced perfect.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this deodorant and it works fine. It&#x27;s a standard deodorant and you won&#x27;t be surprised with your purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> i have been using this deo for some years and love it. the scent is very subtle so you can put any perfume and it would not compete with it. my husband also uses it and works well for him as well.</li>
    <li> I have had this on autoship for a while now.  The price can&#x27;t be beat and I never have to worry about running out.  The best deodorant/antiperspirant out there!  Thanks again Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I am not sure why but Secret invisible solid is the only deoderant that works perfectly for me 100% of the time.  I never have to worry about sweat or odor even if I forget to reapply the next day.  It is not completely invisible though, it can leave white streaks on clothing if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> I do like this product.  much better than a roll on deoderant.  this lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this brand of Antiperspirant/Deodorant.  It is very lightly sented so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good place to get this product at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, although the product APPEARED exactly as described, every single deodorant stick is broken and does not actually move up when the dial is turned. This is really disappointing and it seems that ordering deodorant online was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product but my only gripe is that there is not enough of it in one product.  Other deodorants seem to last a longer number of days before running out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to tell the truth here -- I bought a ton of non-secret deodorant because it was cheaper -- I regretted it and went back to Secret...maybe the cost is a little bit more for Secret -- but in this case it&#x27;s worth it.  Tried and true.</li>
    <li> secret is a wonderful brand of deodorant. I keep a large supply in my house. ( got boys) This is good for the and they don&#x27;t smell like perfume.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant I&#x27;ll use. I get it auto shipped!</li>
    <li> very good, Excellent is the best deodorant I recommend you buy it, will not stain clothing or allow sweat very goog</li>
    <li> Exactly as described - Great Price - Promptly Shipped</li>
    <li> I would give them a better review because their product works and smells great....but they test on animals and have animal ingredients. Shame on them</li>
    <li> Good price for product.</li>
    <li> My favorite Secret deodorant...love it.</li>
    <li> Secret is very good deodorant. I&#x27;ve used it for years with good results. I get this on the subscribe and save program and it is very reasonable and free shipping. I&#x27;m happy with this product and hopefully others are too.</li>
    <li> except for the aluminum just like how it goes on and doesn&#x27;t feel wet&lt;br /&gt;provides smell and wetness protection</li>
    <li> Not much to say about the deodorant itself. My wife uses it and likes it. What I like is the subscribe and save option. A bunch of them come to the house for less than I would pay in the store. :)</li>
    <li> Smells nice and works well to prevent odor. However, while it appears to go on clear, it leaves white residue.</li>
    <li> This product works well but has an over powering scent.  It lingers on you and your clothes all day. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for many years.  Very good deodorant for women. Always works for me. Not too expensive,  great!</li>
    <li> my favorite DO.  Great to get a big supply at one time</li>
    <li> I love this deo! I have been using it for many years. I have tried different ones but I always go back to this one. The others just don&#x27;t protect as good as this one. I only have to apply once in the morning, it truly protects me all day even in the Summer.</li>
    <li> This my favorite deodorant. I like tt he under my arms and it has a freash scent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Joel&lt;br /&gt;P.s. great product as well.</li>
    <li> Good packaging, works great.</li>
    <li> Great Price Great Shipping.  Used this product for many years.  Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I needed some deodorant and it smelled decent. After a few uses and some research I realized it&#x27;s not worth it. It would leave residue underneath my arms where I&#x27;d have to scratch and nearly scrub my underarms raw until it came off in the shower. The smell would even linger after I showered. I could even taste it sometimes in my mouth throughout the day. Plus it leaves white stains on all your clothes. My opinion is to not even use aluminum deodorant. It&#x27;s dangerous, has been linked to many diseases like Alzheimer&#x27;s and breast cancer. Go for the Crystal stick brand or something else. Spend your money elsewhere, something healthier and better.</li>
    <li> Great price and lasts awhile, I prefer to buy in bulk, it saves money;</li>
    <li> muy bueno&lt;br /&gt;gracias</li>
    <li> Works well for cooler months for regular protection.&lt;br /&gt;However, living and walking in the city during warmer months requires more application, and beware: this will leave white marks on your clothing. I have to constantly check for and wipe off deodorant marks when wearing a dark-colored tank or top. Not quite invisible, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Only anti perpetrators that  is strong enough for  you husband and his u derarms s smell really really  bad without. Even men&#x27;s line anti perpetrators doesn&#x27;t Co e close. This is a nice  neutral scent  of girly</li>
    <li> What can you say about something that keeps you smelling clean? They work!</li>
    <li> Good scent and good protection. The main issue I had with it is that I don&#x27;t prefer an anti-perspirant, and it left white marks on my clothes.</li>
    <li> Does the job as needed</li>
    <li> Been using it since I was a teenager, and do not plan to ever switch. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Great buy, I always use this and will keep buying.</li>
    <li> Works well and smells good</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and still pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant</li>
    <li> I love the baby powder smell and that it lasts all day- my husband also uses it another great purchase from Amazon</li>
    <li> I play soccer, and I usually use a mens sports deoderant before games, however I have used this deoderant and it works just as well. It feels somewhat heavy on the skin, however, and leaves white marks all over my clothing, making it not-so-invisible, maybe I put clothing on wrong so that it rubs against my underarms, but either way it&#x27;s a super annoying thing for me. I do like the smell of this because it&#x27;s subtle, but still nice. If it didn&#x27;t leave white marks it would probably be my favorite deoderant.</li>
    <li> I bought this for 3 growing nieces in teenage years and i can immediately see the effects. They used be quite odorous especially after sports but right now they are not at all.</li>
    <li> It may take care of sweaty odors but the fragrance Secret uses sure does not smell like a just powdered baby. The first time removed safety seal and took a whiff it reminded me of the smell of hundreds of pieces used juicy fruit gum discarded on an old movie house floor.</li>
    <li> Classic deodorant and a good price.</li>
    <li> Secret women&#x27;s deodorants have one of the lowest concentrations of aluminum on the market - only 15%, compared to Degree&#x27;s 18% and clinical strength brands at 20%. This small difference really does make all the difference. It&#x27;s this ingredient that&#x27;s going to be stifling your odor. If you&#x27;ve never had a problem with body odor, then by all means, you&#x27;ll probably find this to be a good deodorant.  I have tried it and it works perfectly fine other than not masking odor enough... which is what matters unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Great price! Get&#x27;s to your house in literally 2 days with your amazon membership! I like the Secret brand for deodorant. They always have great quality. I especially love this deal because you get so many sticks of deodorant for a good price.</li>
    <li> This is the only under arm product that my skin takes a liking to. Very gentle, light, pleasant scented. The best for both myself and my husband.</li>
    <li> A good price -- solid deodorant.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom. She requested this brand so I&#x27;m assuming she likes its performance. The price was definitely right for me.</li>
    <li> I love this antiperspirant!  It works great for me and I have been using it for years. Love that I can schedule it to come directly to my house so I never run out.</li>
    <li> I wish I had realized that this was the baby powder scent. I don&#x27;t like the scent, but my mistake.  Seems to work alright.</li>
    <li> What can you say about antiperspirant?  It either works or it doesn&#x27;t.  Secret works for me. I have been using it for years and have never had an \\&quot;embarrassing\\&quot; moment.  I prefer the solid over the gel, because it goes on dry and is not sticky like a gel.  Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, lasts long.</li>
    <li> As always secret that the job for me I have used it for years. I got a good deal on Amazon prime for the set of the package that I received</li>
    <li> Secret is a good, reliable brand and I&#x27;ve found it works well for my body type and &amp;#34;sweat factor&amp;#34;. This particular one has a pleasant smell and I got a good deal on it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m a dude, but this stuff works great.  I stumbled on it by accident (I had run out of my own so I had to use my roommate&#x27;s stuff).  Hands down the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used (I sweat a lot and I&#x27;m pretty stinky normally by the end of the day).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I love this product. It lasts a long time. It smells more like talc than perfume, which is good for this heterosexual male. I would never have used this product except that one day years ago I ran out of my own deodorant and borrowed my wife&#x27;s. It was then that I decided that it would be my favorite deodorant forever.</li>
    <li> it works well but it smells A LOT like a baby powder.. I like how baby products smell but this smell is pretty MUCH even for me.. I used all of it but I loved  Shower Fresh (also by Secret) more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was a little girl. It&#x27;s that reliable.</li>
    <li> This deodorant does not leave any white marks on my clothing.  It lasts well.  I put this on after my shower in the morning before a day of Mardi Gras parades in the heat and it lasted the entire time that I was out being sweaty (about 10 hours), and I smelled great!</li>
    <li> This product is great, it works so well that even my husband has started using it under his manly smelling deodorant.  It works like a charm and even into the next day!</li>
    <li> Not embarrassed to say that I am a guy and use this brand. I find it&#x27;s one of the few which doesn&#x27;t agitate my skin. It also has been the most effective for keeping things dry and this is coming from a heavy sweater. Each body type is different but definitely give this a try.</li>
    <li> Although I am not a fan of the &amp;#34;Powder Fresh&amp;#34; scent, and much prefer the lavender or spring scent, I wanted to write a review anyway. I began using this deodorant years ago after I found the Dove Deodorant no longer provided me the protection I felt like I needed. I loved how this smelled right off the bat- it is subtle when it is on your skin, yet you can still definitely smell it. It glides very smoothly onto your skin and does not burn, even after a fresh shave in the shower. One problem I have noticed with it is that it sticks to dark colored clothing and will leave white residue on your shirt if it comes into contact with the fabric. That is really my only complaint with this deodorant. I have even forgotten to put deodorant on in the morning before going to work (and not showering) and still felt protected and smelled fresh throughout the day (even though I ideally like to put it on daily). I will continue to buy this product, as it gives me the results and protection I feel like I need. Not to mention, it works very well and smells fresh even after an intense workout full of lifting and HIIT intervals at the gym!</li>
    <li> great price better than walmart</li>
    <li> After not being able to find my usual deodorant, I decided to try this. It&#x27;s not as good as what I have used in the past, but I love the smell. Secret has been used in my family by two generations, and I guess I will be making it three now.</li>
    <li> My body chemistry gets used to one brand quickly, which means I have to change deodorants frequently. I buy other brands when I have to, but I always happy when I can go back to Secret. It is the one \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; deodorant that really is.</li>
    <li> This smells like Jolly Ranchers to me. And the perfume I wear makes me smell smell like a mean person. So now I smell like a mean Jolly Rancher and it driving me crazy. Starting to regret getting a 4 pack.</li>
    <li> It is great deodorant and, it smell great</li>
    <li> I always use this brand and fragrance it isn&#x27;t like the roll ons and I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> This works great, smells good without being too over-powering and doesn&#x27;t make a mess on my clothes.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, HOWEVER I GAVE IT A FOUR ONLY BECAUSE IT IS NOT A INVISIBLE SOLID, I ALWAYS HAVE WHITE RESIDUE NO MATTER HOW THIN I LAY IT ON... OVERALL I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND IT IS THE ONLY DEODORANT THAT WILL WORK FOR ME YEAR ROUND ESPECIALLY DOING THE SUMMER. I ALSO USE THE SECRET SPRAY DEODORANT AS A UNDERWEAR FRESHNER.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s deodorant can&#x27;t really mess that one up :)</li>
    <li> There is no question but that Secret, for me, is the best antiperspirant on the market.  I have used it consistently since my teens, which were over 50 years ago.  I cannot say anything negative about the product itself; it works supremely, and I highly recommend trying Secret.  I never have an odor problem, and it never causes me any skin problems.  That said, when I received this package, there are four products, and I am the only one here to use them.  The expiration date is September 2013, or eight months from now.  Since one package lasts me in the neighborhood of three months easily, the last two packages are going to be used beyond the expiration date.  These should have come with, at minimum, an expiration date out at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 28, 2014:  The powder fresh scent of this product is fairly strong and not particularly appealing to me, and I can smell it for about the first three or four hours after applying it.  It will definitely conflict with any perfume or other scent worn.  I would recommend buying just one package first to be sure that the fragrance is acceptable.</li>
    <li> I love these deodorants. Solids never run out as quick and they last longer on your body. It&#x27;s also good to see four as opposed to one for such a low price. I&#x27;ll purchase again and again! (:</li>
    <li> It is a good deodorant but the Fresh labeling might be a problem since the last two orders had expiration dates on the bottle that were already past. So you should either check that as soon as you receive it--and return if expired. I waited too long to notice, only after it started feeling flaky. Anyway, just go to a locall store if you can, and ck the date. Hope this help you avoid my  mistake I made.</li>
    <li> Been using for years so very happy.</li>
    <li> My Husband uses this and he&#x27;s never too stinky to be around, even when he&#x27;s sweaty.  I need something more powerful, so I&#x27;m guessing this is a mid-level deodorant.  It smells very pleasant, too.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells weird after you start to sweat, not very de-odor-izing.</li>
    <li> I like secret.  It works very good.  Keeps you dry and smelling good.  Like they say, &amp;#34;strong enough for a man but made for a woman.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is the only antiperspirant/deodorant I&#x27;ve used for decades.  It keeps me dry and fresh and is very gentle to my very sensitive skin.  - Love it. - F. Parker</li>
