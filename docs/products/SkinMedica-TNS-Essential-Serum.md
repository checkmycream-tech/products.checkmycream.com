<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using Skinmedica products for several years. I am a 64 year old woman who has not had any surgeries on her face. Yes, I have had Botox (can&#x27;t fight gravity) I am a nurse. I have seen that the medical staff use TNS Recovery serum on diabetics for wound care. Remarkable results. The healing is unbelievable. I spoke to is one of the physicians and they use the SkinMedica line for skin recovery. I have demonstrated results on my face and neck that prove this. I do get a micro-dermabrasion every other month and with the use of the TNS Essential Serum my face and neck and the texture and elasticity has surpassed all expectations. My skin care specialist now carries this line, but I still purchase it from Amazon. I definitely would recommend this product to everyone. It is great for both men and women, acne, dry, thin and even for the perfect skin. Yes, it is a little pricey, but highly worth it. A very little goes a long way. Wonderful healing method such as sun burn, for the use after a lazer treatment. You don&#x27;t need anything else except an eye cream. Not greasey or oily. Absorbs quickly. Love the product.</li>
    <li> Best product out there.</li>
    <li> great product at good price. . generally considering how the others are much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;My intuitive said it&#x27;s missing an ingredient, but I&#x27;m still getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Authentic &amp; MUCH less expensive than at the dermatologist office. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, though very pricy.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years and love it.  Was very happy to find it on Amazon at such a good price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at a helpful price (full price is prohibitive), and prompt delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I  love  this product.I have been using  TNS for years . Delivery  faster than expected. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great [price with great service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 1/2 years now.  It really does help my skin heal and stay clear.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product.  Contains everything you need for the aging skin.</li>
    <li> Same I need more time to fairly rate this product</li>
    <li> Been using this product for many years. I use it mostly on my neck twice a day. it was recommended by my dermatologist. it is the genuine thing. Price is great. It absorbs quickly and it does not leave any residue or stickiness on the skin. It has kept my neck smooth and line free.</li>
    <li> You just need a small amount for the face and neck; just one pump. You will see the difference in your face, I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I was leary about buying it online but it is definitely the real thing that is sold in my plastic surgeon&#x27;s office for $270, and yes, it&#x27;s expensive but totally worth it this is a miracle serum I am not kidding you. I will be buying it again when this runs out</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than buying through the aestheticians office.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> As described, brand new, cost is much less than the local cosmetologist charges.  I am a repeat buyer and will buy it again</li>
    <li> So much less expensive on line. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product so far.  I have been using it for 3 months and my skin looks more refined and the lines around my eyes are slowly getting much better.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> Remarkably effective.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. Both serums came out, the colors were fine, etc.  I was surprised when it only lasted five weeks!!!  This product is too expensive to only last five weeks!  There is no way to open the bottle up to make sure you&#x27;ve gotten every last drop.  This serum is not greasy, goes on great and makes my face and neck look and feel great.  I would love to continue using this product, but I would have to get a second job to pay for it.  With so many people buying this product you would think SkinMedica would make it more affordable.  The product itself deserves five stars, but the three stars is for the high price and it not lasting very long.  I will be using a different product.</li>
    <li> My wife likes all SkinMedica products</li>
    <li> i am a little concerned about this product.  i still had product purchased from my dr. and&lt;br /&gt;i compared the two to each other...both colors were slightly differenr but the biggest difference was the smell.  the product from my Dr. smelled stronger  i  have no idea if this order is the real thing or not...but it differs from my original product.  i would like someone else to compare product to see what they think.  it is still very expensive and i would like to be assured that I am not being sold a fake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product~ however it doesn&#x27;t last quite 2 months. I&#x27;ve used it according to directions &amp; it gave out at 7 weeks:-( So, it&#x27;s rather pricey for 6 bottles to cover a year!  The last of it won&#x27;t come out, just one side as others have reported. Don&#x27;t know if this is always the case or not....I gave it 3 stars for it not lasting as long as it should have.</li>
    <li> Needs some improvement with dispencer. Does not dispence serum evenly. Product is great and I have been using it for several years.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the TNS Serum. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used TNS in the past and only stopped because of the price. It decreases the depth of the lines I have around my eyes.They become less noticeable. I just wish I had the money to use it continuously.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years and I won&#x27;t use anything else. It has made a huge improvement to my skin. I am a young 65 and my skin stays moist and wrinkle free.</li>
    <li> I only got about 30 pumps out of this. When I order from skin medica I get 90. I even took the container apart to see if it was clogged but no product was left. Not a good value.</li>
    <li> It is simply the Best</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it...</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of TNS I have bought.  I had no problems with the first bottle getting both white and red serum to come out together.  However, the second bottle will only dispense the white serum.  I have followed the instructions as described on the bottle and the box.  They need to improve their packaging to ensure customers get what they pay for!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this product and thought it would be a waste of money. I was wrong. It helped my skin tremendously and almost inmediately. I had a chemical peel a few months ago (Vi peel) that left my skin in a permanent dry and worse state. Heavy moisturizers did nothing. My skin was dull and it was aging (I&#x27;m 33). I thought I had ruined my skin. I decided to give this a try on a whim. A few days after using this, my skin returned to normal. Amazing product</li>
    <li> This items is a 2 lotion combination so when you pump it , it should dispense equal amounts and it does not. As expensive as this item is, it should work excellent. It does not, and Im not sure it has the same amount of product.</li>
    <li> This is a great  product.  My skin is in great shape and I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and a half (I&#x27;m 55).  It works well with the Retinol A Complex as well (used 2 - 3 times a week).  The best place I have found to by it is on the website SkincareRx.com.  I verified that it was an authorized dealer and they always have sales and great deals on the SkinMedica products (amongst others).  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for keeping away fine lines</li>
    <li> Great service Great product</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have purchased it twice and will do so again.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product for years. This one was defective. Each pump is supposed to be two different colors, which you blend together. This time, it&#x27;s almost always, just the white one and only rarely, is there any red at all. I know, to turn the product upside down and hit it against mypm before using it, for the first time. Even, with doing that,every morning and evening, almost no red, ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my fourth bottle and haven&#x27;t seen a great difference. Arbonne has a similar product for $85 that I used before TNS Serum and the results were similar.</li>
    <li> Wonderful,  but pricey</li>
    <li> AWESOMe ...love it!!!!I am not a firm believer in the skin care products out there ... but I do have to tell u that skinmedica is amazing if you use it as directed ......</li>
    <li> Great product. Great vendor.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Fresh product.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it all and this is the best.</li>
    <li> Loved the Skin Medica!!! The quality and quantity met my standards, I&#x27;m very pleased and would buy this again.</li>
