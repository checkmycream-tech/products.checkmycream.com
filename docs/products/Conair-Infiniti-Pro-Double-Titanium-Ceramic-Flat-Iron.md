<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Conair Infiniti Pro is a great flat iron. What I like best about this iron is that it goes through my hair swiftly and I can create the style I want fast before my hair burns up. My previous iron took longer to run through my hair, therefore causing more damage than this one. Infinity Pro flows through my hair and doesn&#x27;t burn my ends as bad as my other iron-because I can work more quickly. This really is a smooth sailing flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron heats fast and has a super high setting. My hair is very fine and hard to curl so I need the high heat. I normally use the flat iron to add volume and curl to my hair, as it is already straight as a board. I can live with the controls on this one but I really do like the digital readout-this one doesn&#x27;t have that but it does have three heat settings: high, medium and low, but they aren&#x27;t awkward to reach and are simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this iron and recommend it for daily use because it works very well on my fine hair without frying it because I can glide it so quickly through my hair. I like the settings and how quickly it heats up and is ready for use. The red is a great color and this is a nice looking flatiron that is easy to use and does not catch or pull your hair.</li>
    <li> I loved this straightener.  It heated up very fast and had a high temperature.  My hair straightened easily.  It only took one pass through my hair to straighten and my hair was shiny too.  This also did a good job of curling the ends too.  The handle is easy to grasp and it had a nice long cord too. This is my new favorite straightener.</li>
    <li> This is a ice straightener in a pinch but the real problem is it has very wide gaps in temperature control. Just low medium and high. I have coarse hair that I color. The medium doesn&#x27;t do the trick n straightening without several passes and the high scorches my colored hair. So if you have fragile hair use it cautiously. If you do not have fragile hair this will probably work fine.</li>
    <li> For women who can never get their hair quite straight enough, Conair’s InfinityPRO double-titanium ceramic flat iron is a terrific tool. The iron heats up quicker than you can say, “I wish my hair weren’t so annoyingly frizzy” and reaches a high heat: 455 degrees, enough to burn your fingers if you aren’t careful. I started at “medium,” but “low” would have been sufficient. One swipe on each section of hair took it to smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional features include dual voltage, an automatic “off” mechanism, a 30-day money back guarantee, instructions in Spanish as well as English and a one-ounce package of rinse-out Keratin conditioning treatment..</li>
    <li> THREE AND A HALF STARS:  Ok, I did not try this, you know, with my shaved head.  My daughter, a college student with hair to her waist, was on the call once again.  Her Comments: First observation was how short the cord was, a problem for her morning routine, and how hot it gets.  The iron itself get very hot, a good thing but the low, medium and high controls leave room for little adjustments, the  &#x27;not supposed to be&#x27; parts get hot too.  Caution. The width was a problem also, shorter haired folks will have less issues.  Conair is a respected name but this iron is a little on the pricey side.  It works but.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only needed to use my Flat Iron a few times since I bought it, but I like. It works great. Gets really hot, and does just what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned !! Gets hair straight with one pass, even as an African American with coarse hair, it still does the job ! This flat iron is great and affordable. It was worth  every last cent.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, and does not burn hair. Always give the fresh from the salon look! I am definitely happy I purchased these flatirons</li>
    <li> These conair flat irons are awful.  Mine doesn&#x27;t even close completely...causing it to pull out some hairs and leave others untouched.  Back to my trusty Hai.</li>
    <li> Meets all specifications as described.  Is compact for travel and easy to set for different voltage needs.  I am 100% satisfied &amp; can recommend this for foreign travel needs.</li>
    <li> Very compact appliance. Gets extremely hot and works extremely well. I use it on medium heat; at high heat my hair smokes and smells god awful, even with protective sprays. Now if I could only find a product that keeps my hair from smelling like charred death, I&#x27;d be happy.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. But just that......ok. It&#x27;s not the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used or owned. It straightens the hair to a degree, but not with salon type quality. The heat doesn&#x27;t really penetrate the hair enough to totally get rid of the frizziness and I usually prefer a 2 inch plate, rather than a 1 inch because you could get more hair done in less time. My hair is long, wavy and coarse, so it takes a certain flat iron to get the job done and for me this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I love this it is true to description! This flat iron is super hot and smooth</li>
    <li> So why did I rate this flat iron with only stars. I truly do like how straight it makes my hair. Much better than my 200 dollar Japanese flat iron. I have a combination of curly and straight hair so getting my hair as straight as this bad boy has was always a challenge. However, as soon as this iron arrived and was plugged in, it just smells like it&#x27;s burning. It also leaves that burnt scent in my hair which isn&#x27;t favorable. I can really only flat iron my hair when I&#x27;m home alone because it smokes out the whole house!</li>
    <li> I like everything about this product except that it does tend to get hot on the outside so you have to be careful not to let it touch your skin.  My old Conair which stopped working didn&#x27;t get hot on the outside which is one reason I really liked it.  Other than that this works very well and it heats quickly.</li>
    <li> Conair has always produced high-quality hair-styling tools.  I expected the “Infiniti Pro by Conair One Inch Double Titanium Ceramic Flat Iron” to meet the same standards as other Conair styling tools.  However, this flat iron did not meet my expectations; several aspects of this flat iron proved less than satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smooth titanium plate is only 3 ¾” long; this does not provide much coverage for styling hair.  The electrical cord is not a heavy gauge and is less than 5 feet long; my other flat irons have heavy-duty cords that are 6 – 9 feet in length.  If the flat iron is on for any length of time, the plug and cord become warm.  There are three basic heat settings – high, medium, and low.  Unlike other flat irons, this Conair model provides no actual temperature settings measured in degrees.  Even on the low setting, the exterior of the “Infiniti Pro by Conair One Inch Double Titanium Ceramic Flat Iron” gets extremely hot to the touch.  The list price of $44.95 - $34.50 on Amazon – is higher than warranted for the quality of this flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Conair styling tools have always been favorites of mine, the “Infiniti Pro by Conair One Inch Double Titanium Ceramic Flat Iron” was disappointing.  I will not be recommending this flat iron; for me, its negatives outweigh any positives.</li>
    <li> Pre-teen daughter loves it and has no trouble using it.  Even though it&#x27;s labeled for use to straighten hair, she can actually put in twists and curves since her hair is naturally straight.  In the absence of a curling iron, this can still do the job.  For tips on doing that, check out Youtube videos.    Other observations - heats up fast, glides smoothly.  Would be nice if it came with some kind of stand.</li>
    <li> My favorite part of this flat iron is the color -- red, though it does make it hard to see the &#x27;ready&#x27; light...as it is also red. Heats up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, this flat iron did a fairly nice job of straightening my hair. Hair came out pretty smooth, though the plates did not seem to glide as smoothly and seemed to snag more than my regular flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like that the heat settings aren&#x27;t very flexible - low, medium, or high. The instruction booklet doesn&#x27;t give the temperatures for those settings, either, which would have been nice. My hair is still recovering from severe heat damage due to flat ironing a few years ago, so I stuck with the low setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I prefer a more adjustable flat iron. I like the [[ASIN:B00BB8ZIRK Remington S9500pp Pearl Pro Ceramic Flat Iron, 1 Inch]], which is also less expensive than this Conair Infiniti!</li>
    <li> This is gentle on my hair but still gets the job done.  The floating plate is nice to ensure that the plates are always flush.  I love that the cord rotates so I don&#x27;t have to worry about how I lay the iron down.  It gets ridiculously hot though so I never take it off the low setting.  While I&#x27;m sure there are better flat irons, this one is great for the price.</li>
    <li> It works well for the price.  I think it is excellent for at home use.  I am a professional hair stylist.  The cord is to short for Salon use.  In addition it does not work well with styling spritz.  It stcks when I try to curl with it . Even though it heats up to 455 it does it via a high medium low setting.  I like to set my iron via a dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great price&lt;br /&gt;Good iron for at home styling&lt;br /&gt;Straightens nicely on all textures&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Short cord&lt;br /&gt;Heat setting is not variable&lt;br /&gt;Does not glide when you try to curl with the iron</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing! I&#x27;m a black female with natural hair. Which means my hair isn&#x27;t chemically processed to be straight. My hair is very thick. This flat iron straightened the hair with one pass over a section. Gets extremely hot so people very careful. When I used it I only put the setting on medium heat. Hair is very shiny and smooth once straightened. Do use a heat protection product for your hair. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I had a wet2straight straightener for years. Finally decided to step up and got this. Within the first try, I loved it. I went from two hours to straighten this stubborn hair of mine to doing it in under 5 mins. WOW! It doesn&#x27;t burn my hands or my hair. NO BAD SMELLS! And it doesn&#x27;t tug my hair or pull it out. Very tender headed. This is a MUST!</li>
    <li> My daughter has fairly thin, almost straight hair. For some reason, she and her friends spend hundreds of dollars getting Keratin Brazilian  straightening treatments at the salon. They claim it makes their hair look shinier and fuller. She loves this gadget. It heats really quickly, on  her fine hair it needs only to be set on low, as high burns her hair. She preconditioned with the included  Keratin Brazilian oil and was happy with the pin straight, shiny results. This unit gets very hot and I would imagine that it would work well on thicker, curlier hair too.</li>
    <li> Love this flatiron! My hair is not curly. But it is coarse and has fly aways. I love the look after a visit to the salon when my hair looks sleek and shiny. That is what this flat iron does for my hair. It gets rid of frizz the whole day. My hair looks so smooth, sleek and shiny! And it very quick. It is quick to heat up. It is quick to straighten. My hair just glides through. Until now, it was too much trouble to straighten my hair on my own. Now, it is easy and the look is so worth it!</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats up a lot faster and maintained its temperature much better than her old one.  The cord is about 5&#x27; long and was workable from either sink plugged into our counter level outlets. She found it to be comfortable to use and didn&#x27;t cause any noticeable frustrations. I could only ooh and ahh over the results which made her hair much smoother and shiner to the appearance. She credits that it being able to tame the heretofore unmanageable frizzy split ends. Whatever it was, I liked the results.</li>
    <li> As a curly haired woman who always is trying to fight her curls, I will admit that I own lots of flat irons. This one does an acceptable job of straightening. It’s plates are 1 inch wide, but they are short measuring about 3 ¾ inches long.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer longer plates. You can do wider sections of hair with the longer plates.&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this iron heats up quickly. It has 3 temperature settings: low, medium, and high. I’m not sure what actual temperatures these represent, but the high is 455 degrees, which is plenty hot. Unfortunately, the outside of the iron also gets really hot. The handle doesn’t get hot, but the upper part surrounding the plates gets hot so you have to be really careful not to touch that part.</li>
    <li> The Infiniti Pro by Conair was just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; for me. It was a basic flat iron without a lot of benefits. There are only 3 levels of heat: low, medium, and high. The medium was too cool for me to straighten my hair so I bumped it up to high and it was too hot. The cord was very short which is another big drawback for me. The 1 inch irons were okay but pulled a little too much on my hair. It didn&#x27;t go over very smoothly, it tugged or snagged a little too much. Lastly, the iron cannot be locked closed. I would appreciate that kind of a feature on this price point since I travel so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it did the job, but not great. I think this shouldn&#x27;t be in a $30+ price bracket. $20 would be about right.</li>
    <li> Love this one its so easy to use  My favorite</li>
