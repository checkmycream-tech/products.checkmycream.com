      <li>I have salt and pepper hair that was showing more and more yellow.  </li>

      <li>Perfect for removing that yellow tone from my grey caused by adding gels etc,</li>
      <li>I also ordered the same product it is a pink bottle, it is unaltered and the color is perfect.</li>
      <li>This won&#x27;t get you nice blonde hair</li>
      <li>Adds softness and just the right color.</li>
      <li>I love this because it does not make my hair look blue, It is nice and white.</li>
      <li>Temporary Hair Color - 52 White Minx: and love them both.</li>
      <li>This rinse does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
      <li>I had used this product for many years when suddenly it disappeared from the shelves of stores.  </li>
      <li>My husband noticed a bit more white to my hair</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>I can no longer find Fanci Full in the town I live in.</li>
      <li>Roux White minx tamed it down a great deal.</li>
      <li>This was easy to use and took away the yellow and made it ultra light almost white.  </li>
      <li>It still is a little more golden than I want, so when I reorder I will try silver lining.</li>
      <li>it became more brassy than I expected.  </li>
      <li>I have very porous hair that I&#x27;ve always had to deal with, so I know how wanted color slides off and unwanted color takes up residence.</li>
      <li>I really like Roux Fanci-full Rinse.  </li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much that I could see.  </li>
      <li>- I had to be carefull not to use too much to prevent over coloring.</li>
      <li>Who wants purple hair?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it also felt greasy in my hair and didn&#x27;t do that much to improve the color.</li>
      <li>not do much for my hair..</li>
      <li>It might work well for very white hair that woud be over colored with the original product.</li>
      <li>Roux fanci FULL keeps the yellow out.</li>
      <li>it keeps any yellow from showing through on my bleached cool colored blond hair after shampooing my hair.</li>
      <li>Had not seen this particular product in my area and decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>Took the yellow out of my hair and made the gray shine which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>so the white minx takes out the brassiness and pulls out the natural high lights!</li>
      <li>smells like old ladies or something.</li>
      <li>It removes the yellow cast to my gray hair, and provides much needed body.</li>
      <li>I find it to be very &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; on my hair and does not take the yellow out.</li>
      <li>Have not used this product for years and was happily surprised to find it works just as well as ever.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out to silver after way too many years of coloring, and it&#x27;s growing slowly, so</li>
      <li>i found that using actual  white toner works much better and doesn&#x27;t have these negative effects.</li>
      <li>I have extremely platinum hair very close to white/silver that I&#x27;d recently toned with Wella t18, but the ends still looked brassy, so I tried using this.</li>

<li> and it definitely won&#x27;t get you grey hair over a blonde bleach-out.</li>

<li> I still have half bottle left.  </li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t give the color I expected from the bottle and the description.</li>
<li> Total waste of money!</li>
<li> The last bottle I received was watered down, very little color,  </li>
<li> When I put the product on her hair it turned a dark blondish brown and it will not wash out.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m slowly turning it white and silver</li>
<li> Adds softness to hair and slight color and shine.  </li>
<li> You can buy it at half this price, though, at Sally Beauty Supply.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> IT DID NOT DO ANYTHING</li>
    <li> My blonde hair is getting white-gray in it. This makes it shine and look striking.&lt;br /&gt;I juyst wish it was easier to apply...towel-drying before putting it on makes it not really a &amp;#34;shower&amp;#34; item, However, keeping it on my hair and off the sink is tough.</li>
    <li> I have used Fanci Full rinse products by Roux on and off for many many years. After deciding I wanted to be a light blond again and using a permanent hair color it became more brassy than I expected.  Roux White minx tamed it down a great deal. It still is a little more golden than I want, so when I reorder I will try silver lining. I can no longer find Fanci Full in the town I live in. So glad to find it through Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know this product existed anymore.  So lucky to find on Amazon.  If you have yellowing blond or gray hair this will make it silver/white again.  Easy to apply and it works!!!</li>
    <li> Product came somewhat slowly as compared to using EBay.  Otherwise very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help and it&#x27;s watery. It&#x27;s a waste!</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations. After reading lots of reviews, I thought this product would help me acheive the results I was looking for. It didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am 60 and have white hair. Roux fanci FULL keeps the yellow out.</li>
    <li> This is a sure-proof way to get the yellow out of white hair. Why is it not in the stores anymore? Should be. Somebody ought to talk to Roux.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed this product is not available in stores.  It is wonderful.  I have salt and pepper hair that was showing more and more yellow.  I looked online for something, anything to allow me to avoid dying my hair, year after year, Awful.  Roux removes the yellow and conditions my hair beautifully.  My granddaughter told me recently that my hair isn&#x27;t grey; it&#x27;s platinum!</li>
    <li> I love this because it does not make my hair look blue, It is nice and white.</li>
    <li> Good rinse; one is never a &amp;#34;blue lady.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I had used this product for many years when suddenly it disappeared from the shelves of stores.  I searched for it on the Internet and other ways, and finally found it on Amazon.  It takes the yellow color out of my white hair without adding the blue tint other products produce.  I will order it again when needed.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and is a product I have used for years.  This color can not be found in the stores and had to be ordered on line.</li>
    <li> I bought this from sallys for my bleach blonde hair. I&#x27;m slowly turning it white and silver and I was hoping this would help get me a bit closer.  My husband noticed a bit more white to my hair but it hardly did anything. I think this would help maintain white hair. It&#x27;s not for someone wanting a different color.</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  No improvement in over 30 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;Product still stinks to high heaven, has no easy application method and will still stain your towels a nice purple if it gets on them.&lt;br /&gt;Product result is unremarkable.  Odor is still in your hair after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;There are much better shampoo in products on the market today to enhance our lovely gray hair. Amazon sold this and sells the shampoos also I believe.  Shimmer Lights shampoo (even have generic) is the best product for your money.&lt;br /&gt;Can also use this Roux product to brighten blonde highlights etc.</li>
    <li> Works better on my grays than any product I have tried!</li>
    <li> I believe it is working to tone my yellow.</li>
    <li> A stand by product . Takes the brassy out of blonde.</li>
    <li> have been using it for many years,  first recommended by my haircutter when my hair started to get gray. would rcommend</li>
    <li> It just does not get the yellow out of my gray hair. It is quite messy, as you must have your hair saturated with it. I thought this would work for me.  I feel I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> smells like old ladies or something. it also felt greasy in my hair and didn&#x27;t do that much to improve the color. i found that using actual  white toner works much better and doesn&#x27;t have these negative effects.</li>
    <li> I use this product every time I wash my hair.  Shampoo, rinse, then add Fanci-full and leave it in.  It removes the yellow cast to my gray hair, and provides much needed body.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! It brightens tone and can be used daily without worrying about damaging your hair. it&#x27;s also simple as pie to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it does not disappoint. As usual it lived up to my expectations</li>
    <li> I have used this product forever. The last bottle I received was watered down, very little color,  so therefore&lt;br /&gt;does not do much for my hair.. I also ordered the same product it is a pink bottle, it is unaltered and the color is perfect.</li>
    <li> Took the yellow out of my hair and made the gray shine which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> best rinse for my Hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this off and on for years.  I have white hair.  It does good to get rid of any yellow-brassy effects.  One thing I don&#x27;t like is that Roux changed it&#x27;s bottle top somewhere along the way and it is much harder to get it out of this one than the old style.  But product is the same.</li>
    <li> Have not used this product for years and was happily surprised to find it works just as well as ever. They have changed the scent but I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Perfect for removing that yellow tone from my grey caused by adding gels etc,</li>
    <li> Using this after-shower conditioner heightens and preserves the silvery white glow given to one&#x27;s graying hair by Phytargent shampoo.  You will look in top form with this perfect pairing!  Game, Set, Match.</li>
    <li> This rinse does exactly what it says it will do. It can&#x27;t make you beautiful but will make you look as good as you can. What more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything! It was like I just washed my hair with water. Total waste of money!</li>
    <li> I have extremely platinum hair very close to white/silver that I&#x27;d recently toned with Wella t18, but the ends still looked brassy, so I tried using this. It did absolutely nothing and it smells awful, like miracle whip. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Not very effictive in controling the tendency of blond -beauty shop varity- to yellow after several shampoos. I keep my hair a medium blond and have used fanci-full between touch-ups for 50 years. It was good at controlling yellowing or brassiness -i don&#x27;t have a water softener - I had to be carefull not to use too much to prevent over coloring. This rinse is a much thinner very lightly tinted water. It might work well for very white hair that woud be over colored with the original product.</li>
    <li> i was expecting something that would brighten my silver hair .. it made it darker ...</li>
    <li> I am sure, as I have heard that this is a great product so I will not  give it a bad rating but it didn&#x27;t work for &amp;#34;me.&amp;#34;  I noticed that my hair thinned out considerably and it was so subtle that I didn&#x27;t realize that it was happening until I went to pin it up and noticed how thin my &amp;#34;up-do&amp;#34; was.  I was trying to stop coloring my hair and go grey but I guess not!  I still have half bottle left.  I returned to coloring until I can figue out something else.</li>
    <li> it made my hair hard.  I have nothing else to say about this product. can i return and get my money back?&lt;br /&gt;I will let others know how I feel about this product. I didnn&#x27;t know it would make my gray look purple. Who wants purple hair?&lt;br /&gt;I have seen women with a purple tint now I know what they are using. i don&#x27;t like it for me</li>
    <li> Not available in stores - get it while you can.  Great product for toning down brassy color in highlighted hair and softens gray hair.</li>
    <li> This product is very good for GRAY HAIR, get rid of the yellow, it seems the NEW products do not deal with ALL THE GRAY HAIR SENIORS.  I can&#x27;t imagine why, their loss, we spend money too.  So use this good OLD product.</li>
    <li> it is so watery  and did not add any color to my greying hair.</li>
    <li> It works good. My Mom used to use this. Nice to have in between root coloring.</li>
    <li> i love this product.  it keeps any yellow from showing through on my bleached cool colored blond hair after shampooing my hair.</li>
    <li> Fanciful is wonderfulfor my hair! Adds softness and just the right color. I have blond hair so the white minx takes out the brassiness and pulls out the natural high lights!</li>
    <li> I really think this is a great product and love the idea I can get it anytime through a company I think sets the standard for doing business on or off line, you are the best people and business ever.</li>
    <li> This is not a shampoo.  It is a watery blue rinse that did nothing for my gray hair.</li>
    <li> Glad to find this product still available .  Works very well to highlight gray hair that tends to yellow or dull with age.</li>
    <li> It works, but is a bit messy to apply.  The  gel factor is helpful.  My hair is long &amp; that is the difficult part with even distribution.</li>
    <li> When I put the product on her hair it turned a dark blondish brown and it will not wash out.  Do not use.</li>
    <li> I love the manageability of my hair when I use this rinse. I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out to silver after way too many years of coloring, and it&#x27;s growing slowly, so about 3/4 of the shaft is blondish-yellow, which I hate. So, my plan of attack (and it seems to be working) is to shampoo with clarifying shampoos to remove, gradually, the dyes and environmental gunk that&#x27;s in my hair and use this stuff to seal the cuticles and fill in where the unwanted color used to be.&lt;br /&gt;Any rinse will not do all this by itself. I have very porous hair that I&#x27;ve always had to deal with, so I know how wanted color slides off and unwanted color takes up residence. I consider Roux Fanci-full Rinse to be a place holder. Once I (finally) get all the dyed ends grown off, I probably will still use it to protect and manage my hair. You can buy it at half this price, though, at Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have not been able to find it when I need it; therefore, I order it in bulk.  This takes out the yellow in grey hair or color treated hair.  I don&#x27;t care if you are a blond or a redhead.  It works great.  I by Fanci-Full Temporary Hair Color - 52 White Minx: and love them both.</li>
    <li> It had little effect and made my hair heavy like it needed to be washed again.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Adds softness to hair and slight color and shine.  Would recommend to others.  Hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> I was trying to get the brass out of my bleach blond and perhaps even get it a bit grey. This is not the way to do it. Forget those YouTube videos. This won&#x27;t get you nice blonde hair and it definitely won&#x27;t get you grey hair over a blonde bleach-out. And it smells bad and is super runny.</li>
    <li> I have been using Roux FanciFul White Minx for 50 years but suddenly it is impossible to find in the stores. thank you Amazon for keeping this oldy but goody available. it is a wonderful rinse .. eliminating the yellow cast to my white hair and leaving it shimmery silver.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t give the color I expected from the bottle and the description.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get rid of the yellowing as I had hoped. It&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> This product does not work for me. I find it to be very &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; on my hair and does not take the yellow out.</li>
    <li> Roux rinse is hard to find.  This was easy to use and took away the yellow and made it ultra light almost white.  It uses no peroxide.  The product arrived quickly.  I would reccommend</li>
    <li> I love this, it is much better than the older versions.  Does not smell or leave blue streaks on you or your towel.</li>
    <li> Great product for keeping the yellow out, smells great and I use a little on the ends after every shampoo.</li>
    <li> Had not seen this particular product in my area and decided to try it.  Appreciate the way your products are linked.  Does entice you to purchase additional, or different products.  Ha</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much that I could see.  I used to use this on my Mom&#x27;s hair and it always looked beautiful.  So white...</li>
    <li> Excited to find this product!  I have used it for years and am finding, for some reason, no one carries it anymore !!  Thank you Amazon !!!</li>
    <li> I really like Roux Fanci-full Rinse.  I used it when my hair was a very dark brown and now I am using it when my hair is white.  It is especially great now because it takes away the dullness and yellow.</li>
