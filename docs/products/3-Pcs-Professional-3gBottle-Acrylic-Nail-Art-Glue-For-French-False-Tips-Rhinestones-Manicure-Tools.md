      <li>Whether you&#x27;re planning on using it for your glue on nails or to fix say a photo frame or a craft project, they&#x27;re great, well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Good cheap but for 3..</li>
      <li>I just needed some glue to be able to put them on</li>
      <li>I have about 6 different glues, this glue works great not to tacky but holds your tips without moving!  </li>
      <li>even more of they came with a pin to poke the hole, like the brand we all know.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the grandkids will love this.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s the point of sending three is all the liquid could all fit into one bottle then still have some room</li>
      <li>Had problems with my order and they fixed it, good service, glue works</li>
      <li>If something is not right they are on top of it and are very nice about it</li>
      <li>and I had to hurry and clean my daughter&#x27;s fingers before they got stuck together.  </li>

      <li>Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>they were 1/2 full bottles that sucked</li>
      <li>Just buy super glue if you need something like this.</li>
      <li>It is just super glue.  </li>
      <li>Delivered quick.</li>
      <li>This product would have been nice, if I had actually received it in the beginning..</li>
      <li>only concern ( like a lot of glue) is the tip always snipping the tip off but other than that its GREAT!</li>
      <li>While the price for these items are great, they are not very effective.</li>
      <li>So I just used clear nail polish and that worked just fine.  </li>
      <li>but you only need a drop, they&#x27;re pretty potent.</li>
      <li>, i should&#x27;ve read the reviews first.</li>
      <li>Glue is really stong!</li>
      <li>I was going to use it for the tiny jewels to place on top of the nails.  </li>
      <li>Received the product quickly, however all three bottles were only 1/4 of the way full.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for all you have done for me.</li>
      <li>The bottles themselves not so much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d really like them</li>
      <li>The first one was fine on the first use and then I couldn&#x27;t get it open the second time.  </li>
      <li>I just received these bottles, and they have enough glue to fill to the bottom of the labels so that they look full.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, great little glue.</li>
      <li>but I do not have high hopes..</li>
      <li>It as ok, It did the job for a little while</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth shipping back.</li>
      <li>I made a mess with the first bottle, but live and learn, right?</li>
      <li>They work well as other nail super glue.</li>
      <li>This glue completely sucked.</li>
      <li>Half full ... what a joke don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
      <li>Each bottle was less then a third full!</li>
      <li>Very watery and not very much product.</li>
      <li>Bottle was a little half empty but for the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>and I hope it does not dry up if not used in a while.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last long, and barely hangs onto your natural nail.</li>
      <li>2 of the 3 were empty and the third one was only half full</li>

    <li> does what its suppose to.</li>
    <li> Great glue for the price</li>
    <li> Had problems with my order and they fixed it, good service, glue works</li>
    <li> The price is very appealing especially for 3 and free shipping.  But don&#x27;t even waste your time or money.  This glue is a mess! The first one was fine on the first use and then I couldn&#x27;t get it open the second time.  I opened a new one and it was dried out, so I opened the last one it was also a dried out in not sure how that&#x27;s possible but if it could give no starts I would.</li>
    <li> READ REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING, lesson learned. Received the product quickly, however all three bottles were only 1/4 of the way full. Will update on how well it works but I do not have high hopes..</li>
    <li> Came dried out. Wasn&#x27;t worth shipping back. Eye roll!</li>
    <li> The glue don&#x27;t stay for a long time it doesn&#x27;t work on regular fake nails... You will need to put the acrylic...</li>
    <li> Dried out. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> When I opened the glue, the bottle leaked and i was left with my thumb and middle finger stuck together for 10 minutes. Not very easy to use and scary to come in contact with.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy these they&#x27;re dried out before you even use them</li>
    <li> I wish they came with a brush or a smaller tip for easier application, and it&#x27;s really hard to get it out of the bottle. :/</li>
    <li> Glue is really stong!</li>
    <li> Bottle was a little half empty but for the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> The hold is great! The bottles themselves not so much. The tips were dried shut with the glue, so I had to cut the tips off to use it.</li>
    <li> These are a great deal for the price. They arrived in tact and no glue was dried out. Worked great on fixing my split nail in use with tea bag method.</li>
    <li> works great, and came on time! only con is if you don&#x27;t use it for a few days it dries up</li>
    <li> It as ok, It did the job for a little while but all the bottles were half empty. I don&#x27;t know if it dried up inside or what, but majority of the glue was gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this glue works great but when I received it all the bottles were dried out. So, i dont know.</li>
    <li> Works well&lt;br /&gt;Too liquidity (must be very careful to not get it n your skin)</li>
    <li> I just received these bottles, and they have enough glue to fill to the bottom of the labels so that they look full.  They have a few droplets in them.  Not only that the glue wasn&#x27;t even coming out.  Whether it is 2 bucks or 10, the bottles should have enough glue in them.  A rip off.</li>
    <li> its good glue, thank you.</li>
    <li> It needs a smaller tip</li>
    <li> I have about 6 different glues, this glue works great not to tacky but holds your tips without moving!  I&#x27;d order this again!&lt;br /&gt;The only concern ( like a lot of glue) is the tip always snipping the tip off but other than that its GREAT!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and glue is very strong.</li>
    <li> This glue completely sucked. Not worth your money! Doesn&#x27;t last long, and barely hangs onto your natural nail. Very watery and not very much product. Would not buy.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t last and leaked everywhere!</li>
    <li> they were 1/2 full bottles that sucked</li>
    <li> While the price for these items are great, they are not very effective. Save your money and buy another brand of nail glue.</li>
    <li> I got three bottles of glue they were sealed well to no leakage from package during transit. Hope to use them soon and I hope it does not dry up if not used in a while. Will update when I use them.</li>
    <li> Delivered quick. Daughter loves them</li>
    <li> works just like going to the shop</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get the glue out. It&#x27;s way to watery. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> These are great multipurpose glue bottles. They are really small bottles but you only need a drop, they&#x27;re pretty potent. Whether you&#x27;re planning on using it for your glue on nails or to fix say a photo frame or a craft project, they&#x27;re great, well worth the price. And while I appreciate them not coming open (with a pre-made hole on the nozzle [tip] ) I&#x27;d really like them even more of they came with a pin to poke the hole, like the brand we all know. I made a mess with the first bottle, but live and learn, right? Other than that, great little glue. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These were great for the price, I already had some nails I just needed some glue to be able to put them on</li>
    <li> I swear, all three were EMPTY !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the grandkids will love this.</li>
    <li> all the glue was dried up inside.this was a complete waste of money i dont even know why i bought it, i should&#x27;ve read the reviews first. i don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Never again will I buy these.  It is just super glue.  I was going to use it for the tiny jewels to place on top of the nails.  Nope, a big glob came out and I had to hurry and clean my daughter&#x27;s fingers before they got stuck together.  So I just used clear nail polish and that worked just fine.  Waist of my money.  Just buy super glue if you need something like this.</li>
    <li> took like 1 month shipped from china,for the quality you know you can imagine cause its made in china.</li>
    <li> This product would have been nice, if I had actually received it in the beginning..</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for all you have done for me. Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;goodbye</li>
    <li> excellent glue to hold nail art.</li>
    <li> Took 3 weeks to get it but finally here. They work well as other nail super glue. Good cheap but for 3..</li>
    <li> Each bottle was less then a third full! What&#x27;s the point of sending three is all the liquid could all fit into one bottle then still have some room</li>
    <li> If something is not right they are on top of it and are very nice about it thank you guys for being so understanding about everything</li>
    <li> Half full ... what a joke don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
    <li> This bottles are empty</li>
    <li> Slowest shipping ever! But amazing glue for a good price</li>
    <li> 2 of the 3 were empty and the third one was only half full</li>
