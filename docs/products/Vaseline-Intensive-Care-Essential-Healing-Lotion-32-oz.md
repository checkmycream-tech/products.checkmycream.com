      <li>Now I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to everyone, just the most desparate!</li>
      <li>it is amazing.</li>
      <li>It was also not greasy, which I liked.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Recently I stripped and bleached my own hair.</li>
      <li>Before I realized my mistake, I researched OAK EXTRACT and discovered lots of wonderful uses for Oak Extract; so someday, if Vaseline decides to add some OAK to their lotion, I will have a product review all ready to go.</li>
      <li>This lotion has a very strong feminine scent.</li>
      <li>I love them because the price is fair, and most importantly, the smell is really good, I love them all</li>
      <li>It also does not have an overwhelming scent but light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>The feeling of the lotion is very refreshing and washes off your hands easily after applying (not oily).</li>
      <li>Great price for this large bottle.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>If you need a cheap leave-in conditioner along with your hand moisturizer, get this one!</li>
      <li>It is moisture, and I love the smell of it.</li>
      <li>I got these on subcribe and save with a 20% discount plus coupon so total win!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still better at moisturising.</li>
      <li>This product moisturises the skin better than any lotion that I have ever used</li>
      <li>I love the pump bottle.  </li>
      <li>I have for many  years been the victim of &amp;#34;the heartbreak of psoriasis.&amp;#34;  This marvelous lotions has helped relieve the raging skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best lotion for rough skin I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this one for you.</li>
      <li>This lotion works great for general body use as well as hands -</li>
      <li>otherwise the product works fine.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion, it seems to work well, no greasy feeling after, and the smell is very mild and fresh.</li>
      <li>The new formula makes the texture more thicker so it is more on the cream-like side than a lotion.</li>
      <li>Price is right too!</li>
      <li>When I used every ounce of the sample up, I saw it on amazon and made the full commitment to switch.</li>
      <li>The lotion is the right consistency--it is not watery at all, and it leaves my hands feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>I will find absolutely no use for this lotion during warm months (summer)!</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t use any product I want like greasy product or alcohol or heavy perfume but valine is the best for me so far it has everything my body need</li>
      <li>I have used this a few times and it seems great when you first put it on.  </li>
      <li>it is not sticky or greasy, gets absorbed pretty rapidly.</li>
      <li>#34;MADE WITH GENUINE SEA KELP!&amp;#34; but perhaps that would attract some new users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>moisture stays in your skin if you keep the lotion on for at least an hour or two, but if you wash your hands too soon after you put it on, you kind of wash away all the benefits (as with most lotions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Olive oil actually works better but it is just too price prohibitive.  </li>
      <li>my hair looks like real hair again!</li>
      <li>thought the container said, &amp;#34;Oak Extract.&amp;#34; I wasn&#x27;t sure how Oak trees would help my skin, but I try to be open minded.</li>
      <li>I get dry skin &amp; excema very easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything you can think of.  </li>
      <li>(on my face and elbows and shins especially) I use this lotion, and I&#x27;m good for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wanted something that smelled a little nice and not too overpowering like a lot of lotions that are geared towards men.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price for a 32 Oz bottle.</li>
      <li>Has real staying power.</li>
      <li>Its fast absorbing , does not leave a sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>Vaseline, the economic benefits of a bottle of body lotion, non stick very moist ，but there is a hint of fragrance.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to the performance of the lotion, because I couldn&#x27;t bear the scent.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t care for this and won&#x27;t purchase again</li>
      <li>I really like this body lotion</li>
      <li>This moisturizer gives smooth sheer feeling after application.</li>
      <li>There is absolutely NOTHING I would change about this</li>
      <li>I bought the Vaseline Body Lotion really for me to use for my hands.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin glow radiantly and healthy like other nourishing lotions</li>
      <li>The only negatives to this lotion is that it has a fragrance (though it is a nice one, im not very into scented lotions.)</li>
      <li>My hands feel soft and the lotion has a very light scent, not over powering like a lot of other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I got a free container at a hotel and have changed from previously using Nivea every night before bed and morning to Vaseline Body Lotion, Total Moisture, Pure Oat Extract!!!</li>
      <li>I will assume it performs well though, because I have tried a few other lotions in this line of products, and they were great.</li>
      <li>I have pretty much purchased everything that can go into my hair to get it to calm down.</li>
      <li>, I can really feel when my skin absorb the lotion and how fresh it feels without that greasy sensation from other brands, highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It also does not spread as easily on the skin as the previous version.</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I can even run a comb thru it, it feels very soft and natural.</li>
      <li>Left my dry skin feeling moisturized and soft and as an added bonus my husband loves the fresh scent!  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>even my 5months old use it .I wouldn&#x27;t change it for the world.</li>
      <li>I keep the lotion on my nightstand near my bed</li>
      <li>I have used Vaseline Intensive Care for years and obviously find it very compatible to the needs of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I understand that if I put *any* lotion on regularly that my hands would be better, but I just can&#x27;t seem to do it when lotion makes them all greasy--it&#x27;s definitely a turn off and with other lotions, I&#x27;d rather go without than use them and then touch my keyboard at work.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m noticing my skin is pretty dry</li>
      <li>It gets quickly absorbed on skin &amp; has a light aroma not like the typical moisturizers having a heavy scent.</li>
      <li>My hands usually crack and bleed in the winter, but after putting this lotion on regularly my hands are much better.  </li>
      <li>Different from anything else I have used, and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The smell is similar to the light smell of cucumber melon, but with a slight vaseline smell.</li>
      <li>My skin feels rejuvenated after using it, and has really helped with my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The 32oz bottle of this can generally get me thru about 4 months or so.  </li>
      <li>Well, I now know that the &amp;#34;Pure Oat Extract&amp;#34; is not coming from the ocean or the forest, because not much Oats grow in the ocean; however, this product indeed works very well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a 20 year old female (to give some perspective).</li>
      <li>and I usually have to put more lotion on my hands at least every couple of hours because it wears off fast</li>
      <li>The Vaseline body lotion in the yellow container had previously been my favorite since it was \\&quot;light\\&quot;, went on smoothly on your skin, had a thin texture, and, during summer did not make you sweat like the other lotions.</li>

    <li> The Vaseline body lotion in the yellow container had previously been my favorite since it was \\&quot;light\\&quot;, went on smoothly on your skin, had a thin texture, and, during summer did not make you sweat like the other lotions. However, in this iteration of the product, Vaseline changed the formula for the worse because now it no longer has the features that I outlined. The new formula makes the texture more thicker so it is more on the cream-like side than a lotion. It creates a thicker layer on the skin compared to the previous version and no longer feels like a \\&quot;light\\&quot; lotion. It also does not spread as easily on the skin as the previous version. I will find absolutely no use for this lotion during warm months (summer)!</li>
    <li> Leaves upwards of 20% in bottom of bottle, have to cut bottle open to get it all. Already complained to manufacturer about this problem they just sent a few coupons, no other reply. otherwise the product works fine.</li>
    <li> There is absolutely NOTHING I would change about this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always think that lotions have an overpowering smell (think Bath &amp; Body Works).  This lotion has a smell, but it is subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle states that it is &amp;#34;clean feeling lotion&amp;#34;, which is why I bought it.  When you rub it in, your hands do not feel greasy or sticky.  They just feel moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bottle of this on my desk at work that I have been using everyday for about a year (the SAME bottle).  Every time I wash my hands at work, I put on about a dime-sized amount.  My hands usually crack and bleed in the winter, but after putting this lotion on regularly my hands are much better.  I understand that if I put *any* lotion on regularly that my hands would be better, but I just can&#x27;t seem to do it when lotion makes them all greasy--it&#x27;s definitely a turn off and with other lotions, I&#x27;d rather go without than use them and then touch my keyboard at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisture stays in your skin if you keep the lotion on for at least an hour or two, but if you wash your hands too soon after you put it on, you kind of wash away all the benefits (as with most lotions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the PERFECT lotion for someone who doesn&#x27;t like that greasy/sticky feeling that some &amp;#34;intense moisture&amp;#34; lotions can have.  It&#x27;s also great for people who have allergies or sensitivities to smells.</li>
    <li> IT ARRIVED WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSE TO, MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS BRAND SO I ALWAYS ORDER VASELINE FOR HIM, AND THE PRICE IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> Whenever I get a few minutes alone I can lock the door and and this is my go to lotion.  I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything you can think of.  Olive oil actually works better but it is just too price prohibitive.  The 32oz bottle of this can generally get me thru about 4 months or so.  Hopefully when I get a girlfriend I can cut back on the lotion use but until then I highly recommend this for those awkward teen years.</li>
    <li> Grt as always.  Amazon makes it faster. So great deal n great combo. Good subscribe n save. Trusted brand and trusted seller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using vaseline product for the longest. I got these on subcribe and save with a 20% discount plus coupon so total win!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but I have it a four star because it stays greasy for a long time and doesn&#x27;t feel like my skin absorbs it that well.</li>
    <li> Left my dry skin feeling moisturized and soft and as an added bonus my husband loves the fresh scent!  Price is right too!</li>
    <li> I have used Vaseline Intensive Care for years and obviously find it very compatible to the needs of my skin.  I have for many  years been the victim of &amp;#34;the heartbreak of psoriasis.&amp;#34;  This marvelous lotions has helped relieve the raging skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a very strong feminine scent. Perhaps I didn&#x27;t read carefully enough (I was in a hurry), but I just assumed that &amp;#34;Pure Oat&amp;#34; would be some sort of neutral scent. Well, I was very wrong. I can&#x27;t really speak to the performance of the lotion, because I couldn&#x27;t bear the scent. I will assume it performs well though, because I have tried a few other lotions in this line of products, and they were great.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a normal lotion user, it&#x27;s really hard for me to get in the habit of using lotion daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m noticing my skin is pretty dry (on my face and elbows and shins especially) I use this lotion, and I&#x27;m good for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 20 year old female (to give some perspective). Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have used and been happy with the body lotion but feel the price increase may have me looking for another body lotion.</li>
    <li> Vaseline, the economic benefits of a bottle of body lotion, non stick very moist ，but there is a hint of fragrance.</li>
    <li> It is moisture, and I love the smell of it. I strongly recommend this one for you. I will buy another one after I used up.</li>
    <li> I bought the Vaseline Body Lotion really for me to use for my hands.  Every time I have my hands in water and dry them off I always use the lotion.  I keep the lotion on my nightstand near my bed and I use the lotion during the day on the weekends and at night before I go to bed.  My hands feel soft and the lotion has a very light scent, not over powering like a lot of other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because the lotion doesn&#x27;t really last long and I usually have to put more lotion on my hands at least every couple of hours because it wears off fast but I still like to use it and will be ordering it from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> It &#x27;s awesome.  My skin stays moisturized for days. Has real staying power. Different from anything else I have used, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The smell is pretty good and it is a really good price what I paid for. My skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hands - I get dry skin &amp; excema very easily. For the price it works very well, though I agree with one reviewer, it needs to be applied every few hours because it is so lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I stripped and bleached my own hair. Aggh! It is a very damaged frizzy mess. I have pretty much purchased everything that can go into my hair to get it to calm down. It is slowly working, along with those &#x27;cheap&#x27; supercut keratin treatments, but not fast enough. Out of desperation after rubbing this moisturizer into my hands, I smoothed a bit of it into my hair. Voila! It worked - my hair looks like real hair again! I can even run a comb thru it, it feels very soft and natural. Now I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to everyone, just the most desparate! Keratin and other proteins are common both to hair and skin, so why not? If you need a cheap leave-in conditioner along with your hand moisturizer, get this one!</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use any product I want like greasy product or alcohol or heavy perfume but valine is the best for me so far it has everything my body need I use it my husband use it my kids use it even my 5months old use it .I wouldn&#x27;t change it for the world. Aveeno use to b my fav now I have two favorites .</li>
    <li> I use the green bottle of Vaseline all the time in warmer months and I like the smell.  I really didn&#x27;t care for this and won&#x27;t purchase again</li>
    <li> This lotion works great for general body use as well as hands - it is not sticky or greasy, gets absorbed pretty rapidly. It also does not have an overwhelming scent but light and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and this lotion is a constant in my life. I works great to keep my skin moisturized for the day.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer gives smooth sheer feeling after application. It gets quickly absorbed on skin &amp; has a light aroma not like the typical moisturizers having a heavy scent. I loved this product &amp; would defintly buy it again.</li>
    <li> Like the smell of the lotion. Its fast absorbing , does not leave a sticky feeling.Reasonable price for a 32 Oz bottle. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I wanted something that smelled a little nice and not too overpowering like a lot of lotions that are geared towards men. It was also not greasy, which I liked. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I wasn&#x27;t impressed beyond my wildest expectations.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it seems to work well, no greasy feeling after, and the smell is very mild and fresh.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so when a lotion I use gets discontinued/changed.. I have to move on to find another dependable lotion. I found this one a couple years ago. Best lotion ever. It doesn&#x27;t have a strange smell. Its just thick enough too. I use it year round.</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times and it seems great when you first put it on.  Smells good, goes on great, seems to soften and moisturize my skin. I love the pump bottle.  But after an hour or two, I notice a slight powdery residue on my skin.  I did not know what it was from so I tried it several times.  I have never had this happen with any other lotion.  Everytime I use this, I have this powdery coating on my skin that is unpleasant to say the least.  Also when I put it on at bedtime, it makes me hotter when I am sleeping, like my skin is coated and can&#x27;t breathe, so I start sweating, throwing the covers off.  I will not be using this at night again.  The only time I will ever use this is when I know I&#x27;ll be taking a shower in the next few hours to wash off the residue.</li>
    <li> This has been great. I have very dry skin and it has been hard to find a lotion that works but does not break me out. This does both and I even use it on my face.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hands from work and wear. This lotion absorbs the quickest and best. Does not leave MY skin greasy. It smells good too. It&#x27;s the best lotion for rough skin I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I love them because the price is fair, and most importantly, the smell is really good, I love them all</li>
    <li> I use this product for dry hands--especially at times where the air is really dry, and my hands start to feel chapped or sore. I use just a small amount on my hands--you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. The lotion is the right consistency--it is not watery at all, and it leaves my hands feeling smooth. I do not detect any layer of reside or filmy feeling at all. The lotion has a pleasant scent--I don&#x27;t know if it smells like &amp;#34;Oat,&amp;#34; but it is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the container said, &amp;#34;Oak Extract.&amp;#34; I wasn&#x27;t sure how Oak trees would help my skin, but I try to be open minded. Well it says OAT, not OAK. Before I realized my mistake, I researched OAK EXTRACT and discovered lots of wonderful uses for Oak Extract; so someday, if Vaseline decides to add some OAK to their lotion, I will have a product review all ready to go. I won&#x27;t even charge them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI: I researched the term &amp;#34;Oak Extract,&amp;#34; and discovered a few different additives used in skin lotions. Some products use a type of sea kelp, which is also called &amp;#34;Sea Oak,&amp;#34; or Fucus vesiculosus.&amp;#34; I suspect this is not the type of oak that Vaseline would choose to add into this product. I don&#x27;t think Vaseline would want to advertise, &amp;#34;MADE WITH GENUINE SEA KELP!&amp;#34; but perhaps that would attract some new users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;√ Well, I now know that the &amp;#34;Pure Oat Extract&amp;#34; is not coming from the ocean or the forest, because not much Oats grow in the ocean; however, this product indeed works very well. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I really like this body lotion, I can really feel when my skin absorb the lotion and how fresh it feels without that greasy sensation from other brands, highly recommended.</li>

    <li> This product moisturises the skin better than any lotion that I have ever used I have extremely dry skin. I can actually feel this stuff sink in and absorb into my skin it is amazing. The only negatives to this lotion is that it has a fragrance (though it is a nice one, im not very into scented lotions.) and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin glow radiantly and healthy like other nourishing lotions do such as Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter but it&#x27;s still better at moisturising. This product comes in a big container and is bound to last for a long time and often comes with a coupon, so you get a big bang for your buck. I definitely recommended this lotion.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this stuff!!! I got a free container at a hotel and have changed from previously using Nivea every night before bed and morning to Vaseline Body Lotion, Total Moisture, Pure Oat Extract!!! When I used every ounce of the sample up, I saw it on amazon and made the full commitment to switch. The smell is similar to the light smell of cucumber melon, but with a slight vaseline smell. The feeling of the lotion is very refreshing and washes off your hands easily after applying (not oily). My skin feels rejuvenated after using it, and has really helped with my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have the Total Moisturizer in ever size container and have recommended to everyone I know!! Great stuff, you won&#x27;t regret the purchase!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance, but my mom loves this version and the consistency of the lotion. Not greasy, yet moisturizing. Great price for this large bottle.</li>
