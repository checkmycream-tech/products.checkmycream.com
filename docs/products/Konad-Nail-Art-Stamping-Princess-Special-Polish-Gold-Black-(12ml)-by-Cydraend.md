      <li>The best part is that my Orly polishes work well for stamping AND just polishing, so they aren&#x27;t just sitting there when I&#x27;m not stamping with them.</li>
      <li>It comes out great on nails!</li>
      <li>and I was very satisfied with those!</li>
      <li>Works great with the stamps.</li>
      <li>This is a great stamping polish (of course).  </li>
      <li>100% recommended, this nail polish is great for nail stamping is a very good product and a very good brand, i love it</li>
      <li>super stamping polish!!!</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this konad polish, It is my go to for outlines on my nails.</li>
      <li>I have been needing a stamping polish for my stamp plate set, great general color for any stamp design !</li>
      <li>Pretty easy to use, dries instantly and hold on nails just great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of success with Orly polishes.</li>
      <li>This came to me in perfect condition and it even came a lot earlier than what I assumed, this nail polish called \\&quot;Gold Black\\&quot; isn&#x27;t even black!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this several times, I love how it stamps and the color.</li>
      <li>nice color for over other colors, shows up designs</li>
      <li>The only downfall is you really cannot tell it&#x27;s black-gold unless you view it in certain light.  </li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>In the bottle, you can see the gold hue, but once it&#x27;s stamped on the nail, it looks mostly just black.  </li>
      <li>I love konad series however this particular color appeared to have black sparkling specs in it...</li>
      <li>This polish is worth it, for nail stamping, It gives me enough time to stamp without drying to fast.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical but it works great.</li>
      <li>This is more like GOLD w/ a hint of black!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that I would buy the special Konad polish again, especially since I&#x27;ve found both a black and a white from Orly that works much better.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I think the Konad polishes dry kind of fast and make it hard to work quickly enough in order to transfer images.</li>
      <li>I have found only one other black polish that is comparible for great stamping results (for much less $) and that would be</li>
      <li>With the gold mixed in, what I&#x27;m sure was a black at some point, looks more like a dirty brown color!</li>

<li> Other than that</li>
<li> It is definately my go-to black.  </li>
<li> but it just looks like black once it&#x27;s on your nails.</li>
<li> , it does not thicken in the bottle like other polishes and stamps very black</li>
<li> unfortunately, if you are using this as just a stamping polish... it only looks black w/ no gold coming through.</li>
<li> Is this regular polish? :(</li>
<li> and you will not be sorry</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product!</li>

All the other nail polish I bought on the same day online came to me and I was very satisfied with those! Don&#x27;t buy this product unless you are wanting a brown, people!</li>
    <li> I picked up this polish and another Konad polish to try with my stamper, and I don&#x27;t think I like using either of them. I think the Konad polishes dry kind of fast and make it hard to work quickly enough in order to transfer images. I&#x27;ve had a lot of success with Orly polishes. I don&#x27;t know that I would buy the special Konad polish again, especially since I&#x27;ve found both a black and a white from Orly that works much better.

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stamp well. Is this regular polish? :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this several times, I love how it stamps and the color. I have a regular black and compared this to that side by side you can see a difference with the gold. I love it. I would say this is a must in all collections!</li>

I have found only one other black polish that is comparible for great stamping results (for much less $) and that would be Wet N Wild \\&quot;ebony hates chris\\&quot;.  Other than that, I would recommend this to any stamping enthusiast!</li>
