      <li>I personally love the Pour Homme and wears it even if it is for men.</li>
      <li>loved the cologne so much and he was wearing another cologne that time that he even said it over powered his own cologne.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing scent for sure.</li>
      <li>I have used this perfume earlier as well and has a woody and awesome fragrance..</li>
      <li>Good everyday fragrance, perfect for day to day work.</li>
      <li>Scent lasts and is very nice.a very nice addition to the issey family.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend loves it and being able to order from Amazon has made replenishment easy.</li>
      <li>Compared to the original Issi, which i already have, this is the next best thing.</li>
      <li>The price was also very good, i check Amazon 1st and last before i buy anything.</li>
      <li>The original Issey Miyake is more preferable.</li>
      <li>I got a strong melody of woody notes that lasted 4 hours on paper strip.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is warm to hot in character.</li>
      <li>i loved it, and the ladies at work commented on the new smell.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is clean and unique and easy on the nose.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it is very nice.</li>
      <li>It is truly unique</li>
      <li>All in all a great smell as long as you don;t over do it.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is unique from the get-go...  </li>
      <li>To me it smell better than the the first Issey Miyake</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one to douse myself in a fragrance as I believe subtlety is a key difference to smelling good or too overpowering.</li>
      <li>sweet(?)</li>
      <li>- I detect a blend of aquatic, citrus, juniper/evergreen, and an almost pepper notes that settles into a clean and fresh fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Women like good smelling men and Bleue goes a long way in helping us to that goal.</li>
      <li>I prefer fresh.  </li>
      <li>the initial spray, I liked it.  </li>
      <li>Trust me and worth reiterating,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m regretting not having trusted Miyake long time ago although most of my relatives loved and used it on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>I got some familiar notes, but projection and longevity were much weaker on skin than on strip.</li>
      <li>I wonder if this particular one is a knockoff of the original.</li>
      <li>, I recommend widely this product, i like that His price is very accessible and comfortable</li>
      <li>We both like it very much.</li>
      <li>Most reminiscent of a spice market or even the smells emanating from say a Thai food restaurant.</li>
      <li>Women like the smell and, after all, that&#x27;s the reason I wear frangrance in the first place.  </li>
      <li>cologne collection has now surpassed 300 bottles - Issey Miyake Blue has climbed into my Top 10 favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got my bf an this cologne last year for his birthday, we both love the scent so much!</li>
      <li>Not as strong as the first scent last well during the day!</li>
      <li>Fairly sweet, slightly mossy, but also refreshing.</li>
      <li>smell last on my clothes for days and not too strong.</li>
      <li>Just pure scent.</li>
      <li>The bottle is a typical Issey design - uniquely defined and is easy on the eyes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m no cologne connoisseur, but this smells of very high quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>manly but not too much.</li>
      <li>Perhaps this is really a unisex scent.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t work much for me.</li>
      <li>cause I really don&#x27;t know if he will like it.</li>
      <li>and I found that it got more compliments than for the other colognes and aftershaves that I wear.</li>
      <li>If love you love the first one then this one will delight you as well with a bolder sharper smell that will make heads turn buy this one you can not go wrong for the price and the smell.</li>
      <li>I bought this product as a gift for someone and, to say the least, the recipient was very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get more than 2 hours from this, even after doubling down on the spritzes.</li>
      <li>If I were to sum up what trait is most dominant then I would have to say the smell of black peppercorns with hints of ginger, lime, juniper.</li>
      <li>I did notice that this frag is more sensitive to activity/temperature changes when compared to other frags.</li>
      <li>the compliments, i.e. Wow Factor, will follow - Build it and they will come..!!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like any other cologne, very distinct smell...</li>
      <li>Just started using it and found out the fragrance is totally different from the original which I still have some to comparison, and also it doesn&#x27;t even last for an hour before it&#x27;s gone.</li>
      <li>When he opened and smelled it he said \\&quot;WOW!</li>
      <li>About a month ago, I blind purchased Blue because of the great deal...</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised...</li>
      <li>While confined to the office today, I know the \\&quot;Wow</li>
      <li>If you can find a deal for around $30.00 (or less), it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>Might be personal preference, but it is a little too sweet for me.</li>
      <li>But go for a vigorous walk outside in warmer weather, scent comes alive again.</li>
      <li>With Amazon selling product at little more than half the price at mall store, I eagerly ordered from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d wear this to work, or for a day social event, and wear Fahrenheit at night, to clubs, etc.</li>

<li> This product also tends to affect other women too so you must be careful to inform the other women you are already married...</li>
<li> I get some minimal utility from this, so I&#x27;ll keep, but definitely would not reorder.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If i could sum the smell in a single word, geriatrics. Smells like old people, seriously.</li>
    <li> If love you love the first one then this one will delight you as well with a bolder sharper smell that will make heads turn buy this one you can not go wrong for the price and the smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not my thing.  It&#x27;s too... sweet(?) for my liking.  I tried to give it to my dad but he didn&#x27;t want it either.  I&#x27;ve been spraying it on my dogs in the morning instead of throwing it away.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my friend, and he is very happy with the product, Amazon service is great as usual, so thank you...</li>
    <li> I got some of this in a sampler and started wearing it to rave reviews!  So even though this is intended for men, it seems to be a good frangrance for women too.  I also think it has a bit of a flowery smell, like one of the other reviewers, so I can see how some men might not like it!  Perhaps this is really a unisex scent.</li>
    <li> A delicious fragrance and a very rich perfume, I recommend widely this product, i like that His price is very accessible and comfortable</li>
    <li> My daughter gave this fragrance to me as gift a few years ago and I found that it got more compliments than for the other colognes and aftershaves that I wear. Women like the smell and, after all, that&#x27;s the reason I wear frangrance in the first place.  Women like good smelling men and Bleue goes a long way in helping us to that goal. Any questions?</li>
    <li> I collect perfumes and this one was ordered in April 2013. Just started using it and found out the fragrance is totally different from the original which I still have some to comparison, and also it doesn&#x27;t even last for an hour before it&#x27;s gone. Actually pissed by this. I bought this same product 5 months prior to this and I got lots of compliments. This is a total rip off</li>
    <li> Husband was very excited! Been looking for this Cologne for a long time. He smells very good with it on! Recommend for any woman for there man.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband years ago and really liked it.  Then I couldn&#x27;t find it again until&lt;br /&gt;recently so I bought two bottles.  We both like it very much.</li>
    <li> My son loved this cologne  it sat perfectly&lt;br /&gt;On his skin , loved it will purchase  again and again... Thank you</li>
    <li> very good, the smelling is perfect,and express his own caracter .The disign is not reflecting his value.it  very good.thank you</li>
    <li> I personally love the Pour Homme and wears it even if it is for men. I crossed my finger and ordered this through amazon for ground shipping last Saturday night, as a Valentines gift for my man. I have never smelled the cologne just bought it cause it was cheaper than the Pour Homme. (lol) But thinking that it was from Issey Miyake and plus reviews from other websites I just took my shot. My man received the package Tuesday afternoon after work, he wanted to wait and open it on valentines day but I was so nervous that i bugged him to open it cause I really don&#x27;t know if he will like it. When he opened and smelled it he said \\&quot;WOW! this is very very very very good. How come I never knew this cologne?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;He loved the cologne so much and he was wearing another cologne that time that he even said it over powered his own cologne. He said he would love to wear it in the office cause he really smelled SO GOOD!!</li>
    <li> Smells divine. Scent lasts and is very nice.a very nice addition to the issey family. Try it, you will like it!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my date night with my wife! She just loves the scent.This product also tends to affect other women too so you must be careful to inform the other women you are already married...</li>
    <li> smelled good but not as strong as i had hoped, may have to try another scent......know issey miyake fragrances are supposed to be noticeable</li>
    <li> i usually wear D&amp;G, but decided to give this a shot. i loved it, and the ladies at work commented on the new smell. will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> Smell good love it ,women like that smell</li>
    <li> i have purchased this scent for my husband elsewhere and loved it, once we rcvd this one i forbid him to wear it. I wonder if this particular one is a knockoff of the original. Does NOT smell like Issey at all.. very unhappy</li>
    <li> This is a very nice smelling cologne.  I couldn&#x27;t find it at the stores so I was delighted I found it here.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like any other cologne, very distinct smell... manly but not too much.</li>
    <li> A great smell, ladies love it</li>
    <li> MAKES ANY MAN SMELL LIKE A MILLION $$</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after a wonderful  paper strip test at mall. I got a strong melody of woody notes that lasted 4 hours on paper strip. With Amazon selling product at little more than half the price at mall store, I eagerly ordered from Amazon. My actual on skin performance was dissapointing to the point that made me wonder if I got a watered down product. I got some familiar notes, but projection and longevity were much weaker on skin than on strip. I don&#x27;t get more than 2 hours from this, even after doubling down on the spritzes. I did notice that this frag is more sensitive to activity/temperature changes when compared to other frags. Let temperature or activity level drop, (indoor office), this literally dies on skin. But go for a vigorous walk outside in warmer weather, scent comes alive again. I get some minimal utility from this, so I&#x27;ll keep, but definitely would not reorder.</li>
    <li> its great and perfect perfume and this is the first time in my life I got a perfect perfume, try it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this fragrance for about 3 years sitting unopened. I have over 200 bottles of fragrances so it took some time to get to this one. I&#x27;m not one to douse myself in a fragrance as I believe subtlety is a key difference to smelling good or too overpowering. One spray (occasionally two) is all you need. If I were to sum up what trait is most dominant then I would have to say the smell of black peppercorns with hints of ginger, lime, juniper. Most reminiscent of a spice market or even the smells emanating from say a Thai food restaurant. The fragrance is warm to hot in character. All in all a great smell as long as you don;t over do it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m regretting not having trusted Miyake long time ago although most of my relatives loved and used it on a regular basis. It&#x27;s a great cologne for men. Try it and you&#x27;ll not regret your pennies</li>
    <li> This is a very good scent for Issey miyake. Not as strong as the first scent last well during the day!</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift for someone and, to say the least, the recipient was very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I  like the opening notes of this perfume and wish they last longer. Opening freshness somehow turns into a bit sweet, still very pleasant. I prefer fresh.  Overall, it is very nice.</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume earlier as well and has a woody and awesome fragrance.. Those who like the flowery fragrance this is not for you.. Am so happy I found it here.. and that too at a discounted price.. Amazon rocks.. A must buy for woody fragrance lovers.. Too Good..</li>
    <li> Doing the secret santa a work. Purchased this for a co-worker as a Christmas gift.  One of his favorites. He loved it!</li>
    <li> The worst fake I ever smelled. It is supposed to have a green cypress notes predomanantly, but it smelled just like a cheep generic aquatic you find at Stores like K Mart. Under the description from amazon all it talked about 2 paragraphs is how it can smell different on your skin because of your mood etc. etc.</li>
    <li> Blue (Bleue) Issey...Pleasantly surprised...!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until today, I have not been overly impressed with Issey Miyake fragrances until today...About a month ago, I blind purchased Blue because of the great deal... I finally wore it today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the initial spray, I liked it.  The fragrance is unique from the get-go...  Yes, I get it that well have different noses and picking up scents - I detect a blend of aquatic, citrus, juniper/evergreen, and an almost pepper notes that settles into a clean and fresh fragrance.  It is truly unique and I like it.  Nice job Issey..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received compliments from co-workers with remarks the silage (projection) was great.  While confined to the office today, I know the \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot; will be there regardless of event or time of year.  The bottle is a typical Issey design - uniquely defined and is easy on the eyes.  The fragrance is clean and unique and easy on the nose.  If you can find a deal for around $30.00 (or less), it is worth it.  Trust me and worth reiterating, the compliments, i.e. Wow Factor, will follow - Build it and they will come..!! The longevity is above average, lasting a solid 6-8 hours and while barely detectable, my shirtsleeve still smells like Blue some 14 hours following the initial application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cologne collection has now surpassed 300 bottles - Issey Miyake Blue has climbed into my Top 10 favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I am giving Blue 4.5 stars out of 5 and definitely suggesting to add to your collection.  Ride the wave and don&#x27;t ask where it goes..!!</li>
    <li> smell last on my clothes for days and not too strong. compaired to others this fragrance stands out .. .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime Dior Fahrenheit wearer for years. I wanted something different. Bought this on a recommendation from a female friend of mine. It has a hint of citrus, and earth tones. It&#x27;s a great change up for me. It&#x27;s a refreshing scent for sure. I&#x27;d wear this to work, or for a day social event, and wear Fahrenheit at night, to clubs, etc. Got a few head turns in the subway from women, followed by a hungry look...! 2 sprays works for me.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I went to the cologne counter and asked for something with a &amp;#34;Native American&amp;#34; scent and this is what they gave me.  My girlfriend loves it and being able to order from Amazon has made replenishment easy.</li>
    <li> This cologne is smell really good. I can&#x27;t help but spray it on me. To me it smell better than the the first Issey Miyake</li>
    <li> Good everyday fragrance, perfect for day to day work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no cologne connoisseur, but this smells of very high quality ingredients. It doesn&#x27;t have a synthetic alcoholy smell that you might get in a cheaper cologne. Just pure scent. It&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smellwise, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the opening notes. Might be personal preference, but it is a little too sweet for me. After a half hour though, it is heavenly. Green is how I&#x27;d describe it. Reminds me of the smell of being in a forest after a rainstorm. Fairly sweet, slightly mossy, but also refreshing. I dig it.</li>
    <li> Compared to the original Issi, which i already have, this is the next best thing.The price was also very good, i check Amazon 1st and last before i buy anything. Its supposed to be, seems watered down.</li>
    <li> I got my bf an this cologne last year for his birthday, we both love the scent so much! It&#x27;s his &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; perfume, was so glad to find it on amazon, couldn&#x27;t locate it where we lived!</li>
    <li> I bought this... didn&#x27;t work much for me. Didn&#x27;t go well with my body chemistry. The original Issey Miyake is more preferable.</li>
