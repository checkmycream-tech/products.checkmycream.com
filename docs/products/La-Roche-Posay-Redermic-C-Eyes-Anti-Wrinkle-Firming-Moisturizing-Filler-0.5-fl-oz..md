    <li> Great product I&#x27;ve been using for 3years can&#x27;t stop!! Love it</li>
    <li> Cream was recommended to be by a skin expert.  Love the product especially since my eyes do become sensitive to many eye creams out there.  The price on Amazon was more than competitive...in fact it was more half of what I would have been charged, had  I purchased it in a local drug store!  VERY SATISFIED!</li>
    <li> non greasy and non stinging for my sensitive skin and eyes</li>
    <li> Love this product and very reasonably priced!</li>

    <li> I just started using this product and it seems to be working. Not oily and soaks into eyes skin well and seems to reduce the puffiness in the morning.</li>
    <li> Works great, last very long even with daily usage, will re-order!</li>
    <li> This product line is excellent, however I have sensitivity issues and had a reaction to it. The seller is also excellent making return and full reimbursement easy!</li>
    <li> I love it.  This product is excellent, I have been using for more than 10 years.  No complaint&lt;br /&gt;My skin look younger for my age.</li>
    <li> Used product for three days, my face brook out in a rash on the forth day. Cleared the rash with a cream from my doctor. Tried product again , rash developed again. I can not use this product .</li>
    <li> It is a good cream, but I felt that after it, in 5-10 mins I need to apply some other moisturizing cream. Probably it is caused by the HA in it, but overall there is some improvements of the skin under eyes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It glides on my skin. I think I like it better than the Redermic R!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product for eyes.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this and decided to go for the whole tube.  I loved the sample, but the sample packets don&#x27;t always last long enough to help me truly form an opinion.

I think it is slowly helping the wrinkles/crows feet, but I am sure that will take more time just like any other product.  Nothing happens over night!  I will continue to use this since it is the first that I have come across that provides enough moisture.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My skin looks wonderful.</li>
    <li> This la roche-posay eye cream works magically. Use it twice a day at most and you can see the difference in no more than a month. Your eyelids become less lose and your skin become more firm. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. It really works on my dark circles. I am addicted to it. A+</li>
    <li> hello good day.&lt;br /&gt;yes I saw that gave me back money that the product arrived before, and I got straight as picture and description, the store was excellent, exceeded all, I was very happy, I&#x27;m sorry I mentioned yesterday I will not ratify, and put that detail required.</li>
    <li> I am on my second tube of this eye cream, and I could not be happier with this product.  I noticed a difference in the texture under my eyes within two weeks of using the cream.  Just a small amount is needed, and a tube lasts me approximately 5 months.</li>
    <li> Thought this was a knock off, but after trying, it definitely isn&#x27;t. Great quality, my favorite eye cream.</li>
