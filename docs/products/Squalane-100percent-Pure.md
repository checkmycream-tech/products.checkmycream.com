<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Unsure yet, I&#x27;m a first time user.  However it feels great on my skin. It&#x27;s light nonoily and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores. I have T zone skin and I have had no breakouts while using this product. I use this product every night on my whole face, around my eyes, before applying peels and after so far so good.</li>
    <li> Quick absorbing oil, no smell, no fuss, perfect for the face and hand.</li>
    <li> Squalane is a great for the skin. It is moisturizing and healing. This product is really good for people with dry skin, especially in the winter months. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for oily skin though.</li>
    <li> Great for the face. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I have re ordered this already because I love it so much.  My skin is really turning the corner on dry skin.  People are always complimenting me on how smooth and soft my face looks.  I am 43.</li>
    <li> Ok with the purchase, the glass bottle broke after I dropped it so I didn&#x27;t use it enough to be able to give a realistic review.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in my skin...</li>
    <li> Not moisturizing.  Kind of greasy and sits on top.  Probably god to seal other product in, but certainly doesn&#x27;t absorb or moisturize on its own.</li>
    <li> This is the best value I have seen for this product and it is the best moisturizer I have found for my face and eyes as I have extremely sensitive skin.  It goes on smoothly and is absorbed within 5 minutes.  No oily residue like mineral oil products.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> best stuff ever, all natural, i&#x27;ve bought this brand a few times and the quality is the same as with more expensive brands. I use this on my kids faces, too! It is as pure as anything you can get, and is absorbed very fast.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Use am and pm. Leaves skin soft and supple. Beats higher priced products hands-down</li>
    <li> I would buy this squalane product again.  This lightweight product does a good job as a night moisturizer.  Better price than Dr. Lark&#x27;s Squalane.</li>
    <li> My skin broke out from this product, now I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll use it for.  Oiling a bike chain??</li>
    <li> I like to mix this with my Smash-box CC cream, it helps it to glide over my skin evenly, I also mix it in my body lotion and hair conditioner, I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is a generous amount for a very reasonable price.  I like the olive squalane, not the stuff made from sharks.  This is vegetarian and natural.  Olive products have been used for centuries, so I like that too.  No other ingredients in this product to mess it up, just pure olive squalane.  It is very soft and absorbs nicely on my skin.</li>
    <li> This was also a very nice product.</li>
    <li> This is my go to in winter weather. I use this first after cleansing my skin, then add lotion. i have dry skin during the winter months and the squalane really helps keep my skin feeling hydrated.</li>
    <li> this is a freaking miracle product. feels like pure silicon. but it is 100% pure squalane from olives. I put it all over the face under my face cream and add a few drops into my body oil or lotion. it is a light oily gel that completely disappears into the skin after a minute. no greasy feeling but very moisturizing. wow i&#x27;m impressed. I made everybody around me try it and they loved the effect.  I ordered 2oz and got two 1 oz  glass bottles w glass droppers. glass is very thick, I dropped it on a tile floor and it didn&#x27;t break. highly recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;makes skin look 10 years younger, polished &amp; smooth</li>
    <li> I use overnight skin is very supple in the morning</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed using Timeless Skin Care products.  I have very sensitive skin.  My face is normal to dry.  My skin loves this line and so does my budget.</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting this to do more or maybe I expected to much what ever the case this is watery and I do not think it works very well will not buy again</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my face, but decided to try on my hands, since they are extremely dry.  My hands have large dry patches with scale.  After a week, the scale is gone and they are smooth. I have tried so many products and finally found one that works on my hands.  This is a good price too.</li>
    <li> This item was as described.</li>
    <li> This vegetable-derived oil is light and has zero smell (a huge plus!).  In spite of the fact it&#x27;s an oil, this product has never broken me out.  I use argan oil sold by the same company (which I love too), but I like this one slightly better.  My skin gets itchy and/or bumpy from many products, but never this one.  In fact, my eczema-prone skin has improved a little since using this product.  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a coincidence, but at the very least, I know this is not a product that will ever aggravate my sensitive skin.  Like the argan oil, it&#x27;s a great product to mix with creams that are too thick or lumpy, and can help products absorb better into the skin.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a week and have been slathering it all over. It&#x27;s so hydrating and it feels so good on the skin!  My mother-in-law came by today and said &amp;#34;Your face really looks good, what have you been doing?&amp;#34; So of course I had to put some on her and she loved it too. I love it on my feet as well because they always look dry and now I keep looking at them because they look so nice!  I will definitely buy more because at this rate I&#x27;m going to use up the bottle quickly!!  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought for dry vagina issue. Helps take the edge off the severe itching, but not a 100% fix. Will probably be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed with the product. Sits on to of the skin like baby oil. Takes a long time to absorb. Vaseline works just as well and is easier to obtain.</li>
    <li> Great product greater price! I used to buy one that cost me $40 to $50 a smaller bottle. This seems t be just as good.</li>
    <li> This had an almost rubber tire shop scent to it, an industrial scent. Squalane should not have a scent at all. Not sure whya grade this was. I cannot recommend it</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old, and have been using very expensive beauty product for years. I am using only the squalane now, and love it! I use it around my eyes too. I will never be without this again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and it works wonders for dry, flaky skin.  Absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Ive been buying squalene for years from another company but am switching to this one for good. Speedy delivery and better price, plus this is the olive kind. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is very high quality squalane, I am super impressed!  I switched over from another, much more expensive brand, and was worried this might be inferior quality to go along with the lower price.  Not so.  It is lovely, perfect texture, and sinks in almost instantly.  I will definitely buy this brand again when this bottle runs out.  Also, very nice packaging... simple but classy, and the label on the bottle is waterproof, which I like for a product you might be handling with wet or oily hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an all-natural skin care kind of gal, and of the dozens of natural oils and moisturizers I have used, I like squalane the best, by far.  It sinks right in, instead of sitting on top of the skin making your face look greasy, and it makes my skin feel like velvet.  We are talking soft as a baby&#x27;s behind (and I am well into middle age).  I would highly recommend this product to absolutely anyone, especially for use as a facial moisturizer.  You only need a few drops per application, and you should apply it while your skin is DAMP (after washing, or else spritz with distilled water or hydrosol).</li>
    <li> I was told a long time ago that Squalane in beauty products can really make a difference.  I first noticed it in my Elizabeth Arden Skin Illuminating Cream, which I have used for 20 years and absolutely love it. However, it was not in all of their products that I use so when I saw this on Amazon I started buying it and adding it to my other creams and even my Nivea body cream.  I cannot say enough about this product.  It is pure 100% Olive refined oil which I have been told for years is wonderful for your skin, not too greasy just right.</li>
    <li> Squalane is the best product for my skin care.  I have tried high priced creams but always come back to squalane.</li>
    <li> I love this as a nite time treatment for my dry areas!</li>
    <li> betas price I&#x27;ve ever seen. My skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin.  This product is so light and yet so nourishing to my skin.  I need a larger size, I love it.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase. I have been adding a few drops to my regular night cream and rubbing the oil into my cuticles. I complexion feels softer since I have been using it.</li>
    <li> great for the skin...much softer and diminishes fine lines and wrinkles i reccommend this product for any part of the body</li>
    <li> Love this oil. As I have gotten older I have some areas of skin that is just dry and no moisturizer on the market has oil now to address this issue for older women. My Mom gave me this and I started just over a month and a half ago using it and the dry places are gone. I even had prescription medications that did not work. Great stuff, not to heavy and does not cause a discoloration of my makeup where I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is absorbed in just a very short time and I have had no issues with it at all. Locally it costs almost three times as much as this bottle so this was a very good bargain</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good, but i need a much larger size than this one</li>
    <li> Good - I don&#x27;t know if it is a good as the squalane from fish but then there is the issue of killing the sharks...It is good for what it is.</li>
    <li> Provides SO much moisture to the skin!  This bottle has lasted 3 months and still have 1/2 bottle or so left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mature skin - this Squalane Is very nourishing &amp; incredibly hydrating!  Silky feel to it.  Recommend!  I see this as a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; product, and this brand is very good so I will look no further and will re-purchase same brand when this starts to run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I use it under primer and foundation - I apply sparingly as there&#x27;s no need to use much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night I apply my DIY Vitamin C serum and then I use this as last step for moisturizing.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I have use it since the first time I bought, and l have not stop. It is simple, but works. Two years, I have no complain, and my skin is getting better, you dont need speed a lot money.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I have very dry skin and this works the best for me</li>
    <li> Not impressive! A waste of money! It is oily to me, also I have some rashes come out, my skin doesn&#x27;t like it... It smells funky!</li>
    <li> I like this oil because this is very light, yet this keeps my skin&#x27;s moisture, and this does not oxidase.</li>
    <li> They used every night before going to sleep and they say that the product cleans and soften their skin, they feel great about using it every time. I only used once and noticed my face looked much better the following day but I am too lazy to use it every night.</li>
    <li> I have used squalale before, but I like this larger size. It is good for removed dry skin, and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my mother who was using the Mayumi squalane. This squalane bottle does okay I would say, but it wasn&#x27;t as effective as the Mayumi squalane she had.</li>
    <li> goes on smooth, hydrates, and is absorbed well by your skin.  I have acne-prone skin and this has hydrated it, without clogging the pores.</li>
    <li> Better price than most. Does wonders for my skin. It moisturizes my dry aging skin quite well. I like it.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for long time and works as well as other products at 4 times the price. good buy!</li>
    <li> This is, without a doubt, the very best moisturizer for your face out there - -  I have used it for years and, though I hesitate to say it, my skin does not look my years!  An added, though to me very important, benefit is that it is made from olives - not sharks&#x27; livers.  One should be careful not to get the stuff made from shark - it is such a waste - particularly when there is this wonderful product made from olives ...</li>
    <li> This saved my skin. I am on my 3rd bottle. I mix it with a little lotion and it keeps the moisture in for days</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months as my moisturizer... I always get compliments😄</li>
    <li> I feel this product does nothing for my skin.  It does not absorb and stays on the skin with an oily feeling.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I make my own skin concoctions and this is one of my better ingredients! Surprised that more women dont know about it!</li>
    <li> When my skin needs that extra punch...I add squanlane oil to my moisturizer or use alone...helps heal my dry skin</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but the effects of this last longer than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. Any other product just washes off but the effects of this extend beyond washing. It&#x27;s also a very light and odorless product. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a very moisturizing oil that absorbs quickly without being greasy. It arrived quickly, was packaged securely, and I like the fact that the price was so low for two ounces. Sadly, though, my finicky acne-prone face didn&#x27;t take too well to it. Since I can&#x27;t use it on my face though, I&#x27;ll be adding it to coconut oil for my body.</li>
    <li> I have been using squalane on my face and neck and notice a great benefit to moisturizing and healing any little blemish almost immediately.  My husband has also been using when he has a tiny blemish and is pleased with the results.  Thanks</li>
    <li> very hydrating and easy to apply, soaks in fast, dropper lets you put it where you want it with no waste</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  It feel so wonderful on parched skin. I use it morning and night and am sure I will order more.</li>
    <li> This olive squalane is the same as other products, but a better value and great packaging. Will surely purchase again. It would be nice to see a full ingredient list or other supporting documentation verifying that it is 100&amp; Pure (I own a skincare business, and like to have forms as such)... The only thing that I was say, is shipping was a bit slow, but I am also impatient, when I really want to try new things. Choose your battles wisely. EXCELLENT PRODUCT! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Non irritating</li>
    <li> I have seen Squalane offered by pricier brands in a number of cosmetic lines but decided to try this one since it&#x27;s affordable.  Goes on like silk and is very rich and hydrating.  Great for dry, dehydrated or mature skin.  I use it under makeup but less dry complexions may want to use it at night.  I put my regular moisturizer over this and I&#x27;m moist with a bit of a glow all day.  Worth every penny.  Glad this line offers such high quality products.</li>
    <li> My skin is ever dry, the texture getting rough and uneven and it&#x27;s always been a problem for me to get the right moisturizer for my allergic skin. This thing does the job just great and leaves my skin smooth and moist. Gonna order more in view of cold season.</li>
    <li> I wonder if the clear bottle will make it go rancid sooner.. but for now, I like Squalane and this is a nice product for a nice price.  It makes a big difference if you wear it to bed every night</li>
    <li> Works very well especially for parched skin, great product for little money</li>
    <li> Very greasy and does not absorb well which it says it&#x27;s supposed to.  Don&#x27;t see any difference in making skin any smoother.</li>
    <li> i live in the desert Phoenix and the weather has changed going into winter, the air is VERY dry, your skin starts to flake and itch...Not this year. I use this right after the shower all over my body then 5 mins later put on lotion and my skin feels and looks amazing;) it is oily like olive oil but no smell and it does absorb into skin but it takes a full 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;Update- I still give this 5 stars it&#x27;s amazing to use on dry spots or all over. I am on my 2nd bottle but i spilled the last one 1/2 through</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dry skin all my life and have used many different facial moisturizers, but the aging process took it&#x27;s toll on my skin and made my skin drier to the point of uncomfortable.  I needed something that was safe for my face and that would work with my daily moisturizer.  After research, I found this product.  When it arrived, I used it right away.  It did the trick.  It is highly concentrated, so a little goes a long way.  I apply and rub a little over my entire face and neck area, then put my daily moisturizer over it.  I do this twice daily, in the morning and right before going to bed.  My skin is softer, it is moist and here&#x27;s what&#x27;s priceless; my skin feels a lot more comfortable. Perhaps for others, this product alone may be sufficient, but I need both; Squalane and my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It comes in a nice glass jar with a big eyedropper style applicator.  I use it on my face morning and night and my skin is soft and happy.  Recently I switched to airbrush foundation - I love the look, but it was drying my skin.  This squalane has solved the problem.  I love that it&#x27;s unscented and simple.  It also works great as a cuticle conditioner.  Definite re-order for me.</li>
    <li> This product soaks into my skin and leaves a nice texture.  It does not leave the oily film that a more expensive product does.  I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> Nice product. I combine with my aloe cucumber witch hazel as my eye make remover. I will use alone as my night time hand moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It took a few months to see the real difference on my face, but this is super good and feels so nice- not greasy but smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I put a drop of lavender essence in the bottle just to give it a slight fragrance. I love this stuff and recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten complements saying: &amp;#34; Your skin looks so beautiful&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love the product but it&#x27;s certainly  not for anyone with naturally oily sink...and even if you are older and have dry skin takes only the tiniest bit applied and it&#x27;s not a product to use if you plan to put on makeup...I use it when I&#x27;m going to be around the house....and I use it EVERYWHERE....LOL...there are areas of my skin that just do not hydrate this over the hyaluronic acid sold by the same company will for sure improve any areas you have that are dry and unresponsive to over the counter products...I would say that the products this company sells are for those who know about skin care...I&#x27;m am licensed so know what to do with these products to make them work and they surely do work...great company, great product.</li>
    <li> I have a very dry neck and couldnt seem to find a moisturizer that would hydrate it.  My facialist recommended squalane and I love it.  I still have the first 2 ox. I bought around the end of Sept. - I put on my neck each night and under my eyes. My neck feels so much softer and it&#x27;s not as itchy and uncomfortable as it was. I was back to my facialist and she was thrilled with the results.  I just bought 6 packages - one for me and the rest for Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> Used this on my hands due to extreme dryness and it was great with a splash of water.  No greasy feel.  Helped a lot!</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and was packaged well.  I am using up my existing product so I have not used any of the new bottles.  The price was so much better.</li>
    <li> Nice product no smell great bottle and has a dropper so you can use as much or as little you want . Caused me breakout but for me its a major issue with all oily products ..ugh sinks right in though ...nice and light oil for those who do not have acne prone skin .For me it didnt work sadly!</li>
    <li> like the subject said...  it is what it is... but i should add that i like the white look of it... kinda stand out in my collect of bottles of oils...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the Squalane scene and was first introduced to it through a brand Deepak Chopra mentioned in a newsletter email (not Timeless brand.) I was able to get a free sample of it and tried it out on my cracked fingers. I work in food service and wash my hands frequently, do dishes and we use a liquid sanitizer on our equipment, because of this the sides of my forefinger, thumb and middle finger are rough and cracking. I tried to remedy the problem with lotion and moisturizing gloves but it wasn&#x27;t doing anything. When I got the free sample I tried it on my hands that evening and in the morning noticed an immediate difference, my fingers were so much softer on the surface. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made in one night. Did it cure it? No, but I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of the sample and was considering buying it but the $60 price tag was too much (I work in food service after all!) so I went to Amazon to see what they had and found Timeless and its great reviews. I ordered it, got it in a timely fashion, applied it that evening and used my moisturizing gloves. The next morning I noticed a difference but it was nowhere near the other brand&#x27;s effect. In fact, I decided to write this after using more of it and getting little results. I applied the serum to my fingers, rubbed in then put lotion on my hands (Alba brand) then I did another round of the squalane over the lotion, rubbed it in again and then put my moisturizing gloves on and upon waking my fingers were rough to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it and mixing it with my lotion to moisturize but I won&#x27;t be counting on it to help my cracked fingers, it&#x27;s just not strong enough. Not sure what the other brand has over Timeless but there is a significant difference and now I see why that brand has such a high price tag.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer if it does not irritate your skin.  I think it is irritating my cheek and leaving a red spot, just on one side, which I can&#x27;t figure out, but it does a good job of moisturizing skin if you have older skin.  It could be too oily for young, or oily skin.  It is made from olives, or so it says, so it is animal free, which I like.  It doesn&#x27;t sound like a very big bottle at 2 oz. but it lasts a long time.  You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
    <li> I add a couple drops of this to my regular body moisturizer to each squirt I put on body and it makes the moisturizer richer.  When used on face, only a little is needed.&lt;br /&gt;Goes a long way.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using squalane under my night cream for several years.  I am satisfied with this brand&#x27;s quality and price.  For those looking for a review of the benefits, I will say that my skin is very dry and I am closer to 60 than 50.  This is oil, and it feels oily when first applied.  My skin sucks it up pretty quickly and it feels good to me.  I think it helps keep my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I like this one because of the price and the handy dropper effect.  I would recommend it to friends.  It is a very pure product.</li>
    <li> Works great shipped fast</li>
    <li> love this product, makes your skin so smooth and silky. It does take alittle time to penetrate into the skin but not problematic. would recomend to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
    <li> I had received a free sample of another product containing squalane in it, and liked it.  Squalane, however, is half the cost of the other product, and I know it&#x27;s pure and everything I had hoped for.  My daughter has sensitive skin, and is also using it now.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I try alot of products on amazon because I love to read the reviews. I have never wrote a review before but feel compelled to because I love this product. my skin feels so smooth and looks better two weeks into using it.  I have tried the most expensive skin products and this is a keeper</li>
    <li> Great great product! Skin feels So smooth &amp; soft. Will order again!</li>
    <li> This oil is a miracle and has done wonders for my skin.  I use it constantly.  The seller is a tad slow with shipping, and you can&#x27;t get express, so I always order many at a time.</li>
    <li> SO pure, so fresh, at a very good pricing. I decided i had to get some squalene instead of getting ripped off by buying the $80.00 Caudelie Vinoperfect Radiance Serum with who know just however many percentage of stingy amount of squalenes mixed in with other additives lies perfumes and stuff that may have clogged pores. Check out my skincare reviews at&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.vividsavvy.com/2013/06/super-anti-aging-skin-care-products.html</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from another company. I loved it &amp; went on line to purchase it. I saw this product @ less than half the price &amp; decided onit instead. Love it. Same stuff... Halfe price.</li>
    <li> Is not overly greasy, comes with a nice dropper to keep the oil contaminant free. Great price for the quantity and this is not from animals, it&#x27;s plant based!</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this while looking for a natural moisturizer to use during the super dry winter months.  This completely fits the bill.  I use one drop on each cheek and a drop on my neck.  That&#x27;s all it takes.  I even purchased this for a friend of mine in Arizona and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My gma has used shark squalene for over 30 years and has great skin. This one is cheaper and is from a more feel good source. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now. It eliminates dry skin I had in winters past. I also use it with retin-a and that no longer burns my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I had a terrible sunburn recently. I used this and my husband did not. The next day mine was tan (I&#x27;m pale. That never happens.) and his was still burn (he does tan the next day, usually.) Really impressed!</li>
    <li> Odorless to my very sensitive sense of smell, and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> At one time II was able to afford high end beauty supply products- name brands Sephora, etc. as well as professional facials. I can no longer afford such expensive products/services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, I started reading extensive reviews, watching Utube for suggestions( i.e. this is where I learned that the Monistat Chafting gel has the same ingredients as Sephora&#x27;s primer (is actually better with less additives), etc., and started purchasing Amazon products that are extremely cost effective and in some cases the same product used when I had professional treatment, i.e. 35% Glycolic Acid, Emu oil, Argan Oil, Squalane, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results - if used properly - provide me the same results as professional treatment. Highly recommend these products but caution to read the reviews, especially on peel products such as the Glycolic Acid, so you do not damage skin and get exceptional results.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best mositurizer you could buy!  Melts into the skin and works immediately to soften your skin!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this moisturizer. It makes my skin feel like silk. I have bought several bottles and my face always glows. If you have flawless skin you don&#x27;t need makeup. Most of the time i don&#x27;t wear any. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> SQUALANE FROM OLIVES IS WONDERFUL  HAVE USED IT FOR 20+ YEARS  SQUALENE FROM SHARKS IS NOT BENEFICIAL TO HUMANS OR THE SHARK</li>
    <li> Really lubricates and moisturizers the skin leaving no residue.</li>
    <li> I read an article on squalane, not too long ago. Mentioned the many benefits, so decided to order and try it. I was familiar with squalane (or squalene), as I used a moisturizer that squalane was the primary ingredient, many yrs. ago when I was in my 30&#x27;s. I love it, but finially moved on to other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;As per other reviewers advice, I add a few drops to my daily moisturizer, morning and evening. I can&#x27;t honestly say I really see any real benefits....like I look yrs. younger or I have that glow, but it feels good, it does absorb quickly, so one does not feel greasy. I will probably keep using it.</li>
    <li> My skin loves the Squalane!</li>
    <li> This product has helped me wonderfully with my rosacea, hardly have any redness left. I&#x27;ve been using it on my hands and neck and the skin is feeling less thin and fuller! I use it on my face one to two times a day. Just 4 drops, helps my foundation as well to glide on nicely. Great addition to my skin care needs :) My sister had the lazer technique done on her face for rosacea and I feel my skin looks pretty good without having the lazer technique done for only $13 dollars! Its only been about 4-5 weeks so far...</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with product and price.  I have used other product lines at a higher cost. The packaging was perfect.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate and use this daily.  I love how it leaves my skin.  I use it on my face and body.</li>
    <li> This really works! I had use Trilane what was way costly and then I found this for more then 1/2 the price. Will be buying more from Timeless Skin Care.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is excellent quality. I first purchased this from a skin care company at 3 times the price and little difference in quality. I recommend this for value and performance.</li>
    <li> I really like this squalene. I have pretty dry skin and this oil keeps my face moisturized all day. The reason I bought this product was because I had read in a beauty blog how great it is for your skin. I love beauty products and for less than $20/bottle, i was willing to give this a try. I did not know at the time, however, that there are multiple sources of squalene oil. I&#x27;m happy and relieved that I purchased the olive-derived oil and not the shark liver- derived squalene oil. I was horrified to find out through some online research that hundreds of thousands of sharks are being killed every year so that we can try to diminish fine lines. So, needless to say, this is a great beauty product that I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome on my dry skin.  Especially my hands.</li>
    <li> Great! I use this with a mixture of oils for my face and have had zero issues with it. I dont feel greasy and my skin sucks it right up! No breakouts so far, and Ive been using it for almost a week.</li>
    <li> Read about Squalane olive oil, decided to try it from Timeless Skin care.  One of the best oils out there, i&#x27;ve used argan oil previously, but definitely prefer squalane olive oil.  Thanks Timeless, your product is the bomb and thanks Amazon for offering it.  5 stars to Timeless Skin Care and Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using argon oil for the past year (bought from the same seller Timeless Skin care, who I can recommend, items ship promptly and are safely packaged, their products are from what I can tell of very good quality) and I have to say even as I could not have imagined stop using argon oil , I do prefer the feel of squalane on my skin. I can best describe it as Squalane being less greasy, as many others commented it easily penetrates into the skin , and within minutes I was able to use it over my make up (which is cinema secret, it is crème based, it also works great under the cinema secret primer) Being able to use it twice a day with my make up application is definitely keeper for me. Highly recommend you try this product, especially if you have been searching for a great moisturizer and been spending a fortune on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my mid 40th , do have dry skin and fine wrinkles setting in around the mouth, laugh lines and forehead, having used more natural products like Hyaluronic Acid and Argon Oil made a huge difference. Squalane as in my opinion is very comparable to Argan oil but less greasy will work better for me because I wear Make up .</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with this product, I just feel emu oil works better for me personally. If you are vegan this is a perfect alternative.</li>
    <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin.  No moisturizer is really up to the task of keep it soft, especially on my arms and legs.  I mix a few drops of Squalane with my regular moisturizer to get an extra moisturizing boost.  It helps.  A lot.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very soothing to the skin.</li>
    <li> Great quality squalane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effortlessly seeps into your skin.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a moisturizing toner first and finish off with squalane....and my face is thoroughly moisturized&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the main ingredients of many expensive creams......&lt;br /&gt;FORGET THOSE CREAMS, JUST USE THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for my puppies feet. It&#x27;s suppossed to make her paws soft again. So for it has not worked.</li>
    <li> If I&#x27;m going to go the oil route I&#x27;ll stick to jojoba or tamanu. This didn&#x27;t do it for me and I&#x27;ve barely touched it since purchasing months ago.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day morning and evening as my face moisturizer and so far it has been great, my skin looks and feels good, it&#x27;s very light and not greasy as I have very oily skin.</li>
    <li> I use this morning and night. I have very dry sensitive skin and Squalane makes a huge difference. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Im mystified by the high praise others have given this product and purchased it based on the high marks.  If it works for them, great. For me it absolutely dried my skin out to the point where I looked like a prune. This was alarming as if you are a middle aged woman you might be able relate to. I tried to give it a chance, using it for several days but had to give up finally.</li>
    <li> Just what I was hoping for! I had bought a similar product from another company a few years ago, but the company went out of business. I saw this when I was browsing and was hoping it was what I wanted. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Youth in a bottle! Not quite fountain of youth, but I tried the oil on the back of one hand only for a few days. It was obvious after two days which hand had the extra attention, even though I continued to use my regular hand lotion throughout the trial period. I use it on my face now. No plugging of pores, just extra softness.</li>
    <li> The Squalane (oil olive) does an excellent job of moisturizing and makes application of makeup easy and cake-free.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! This is a very light weight oil. I bought it for a facial scar and it&#x27;s helping to  keep it moist and seems to be speeding up the recovery time! I will buy more as soon as I run out. Also a great moisturizer and does not cause breakouts on my typically dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this squalene product! Timeless Skin Care did it again! This has a thinner consistency than Roth, but I like it very much, because it really hydrates my skin, amd sinks deep. The only thing is a slight smell that smells initially like a car oil, but it quickly disappears. I trust Timeless, I&#x27;ve used their HA for years, so  I was excited to try this, and will buy again,</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. My first time to use this product.  Love the way it makes my face feel.  It makes my face look very smooth, I use this as a moisturizer . Will order again.</li>
    <li> This product I use every other day to ensure I don&#x27;t get facial wrinkles and its wonderful.  I also use it in soap making.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive, dry skin! Would have gotten five stars, but the bottle falls apart. Luckily, I have other dropper bottles to put the product in, because this white-topped dropper bottle only lasts about half-way through the bottle before the top rubber part squirts itself out of the hole it sits in. I&#x27;ve gotten two of these so far and the rubber top popped out of both.  As far as the product goes, it&#x27;s great. No harmful chemicals, no worries about skin reactions, it smooths aging, dry skin and no more flakes. This is actually the PERFECT product for anyone who wants to lessen lines, keep their face from getting dry and who has any kind of allergy to all the toxic garbage in most moisturizers. The price is excellent, too.  If they could just do something about the bottle top falling apart this product would get six stars!</li>
    <li> I am sure that my hair is healthier because of this and the argan oil.  Also, my hands had gotten a little rough.  I apply this and the argan oil, and now my hands feel wonderful.</li>
