### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;*Price on Amazon fluctuates a lot, best to stock up</li>
      <li>Great bang for your buck when you buy this 4 pack too!!!</li>
      <li>After years of trying products, this was the best.  </li>
      <li>This price (once you&#x27;re committed to four containers!) is very good compared to drugstore.  </li>
      <li>It has the perfect density and provides good hold for hair.</li>
      <li>For the price, this stuff is great and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>great hair product, doesnt leave any flakes.</li>
      <li>This is great stuff.</li>
      <li>If you know what you want, this is a great deal.</li>
      <li>I think this product has been discontinued, which is a shame because it performs great.</li>
      <li>Absolutely Amazing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using this product and the best part is honestly the smell because I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>Product is good.</li>
      <li>Competition is good.</li>
      <li>A good substitute for Crew pomade and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>Style your hair in the morning with your fingers and your good to go.</li>
      <li>found this at Target for $2.75 loved its smell and price.  </li>
      <li>I also need to use a fair bit more of the Suave than I do AC.</li>
      <li>This hair product is best described as a clear, gummy paste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Might be ok if all you&#x27;re looking for is frizz control, but doesn&#x27;t offer much more than that after an hour or two.</li>
      <li>Just wish I had got more, can&#x27;t find it in the store.</li>
      <li>The best part of it all, is that a tiny bit of pomade controlled my truly unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it, but I believe Suave is no longer producing this product.  </li>
      <li>Suave&#x27;s pomade seems more like a super-thick gel to me.</li>
      <li>Love this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>but there is a lot more product in the Suave container (lighter, which I think supports the fact that you need to use more).</li>
      <li>I am glad Amazon is selling it</li>
      <li>I love this pomade.  </li>
      <li>(was able to find a 4-pack on Amazon for 14 bucks)&lt;br /&gt;*Does</li>
      <li>USED to be a great product for a reasonable price on AMAZON (14.00 for 4).</li>
      <li>Since it is medium hold, it is better for shorter and thinner hair</li>
      <li>this pomade works just right for me, good shaping without being sticky.  </li>
      <li>I have no idea why, it smells great, had a relatively decent hold and gave the appearance of semi-wet hair.</li>
      <li>always, once you have your hair perfectly combed and done, it always helps to use a very light-misy hairspray to really hold things in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, it is as good as Crew Or Bed Head and much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used pomade, but have been a huge fan of gel.  </li>
      <li>clean, easy to get off your hands (or hair)&lt;br</li>
      <li>, this product works great and last all day.</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s no flaking, the smell is light and indiscernible throughout the day.</li>
      <li>This stuff is cheap for a reason, do NOT use it.</li>
      <li>used it cause it was cheap at the supermarket.</li>
      <li>The closest match to this product is AXE Shine Pomade, Smooth Look.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, Target makes the same mistake in-store and in its ads.  </li>
      <li>overall, for the price it is a good deal.</li>
      <li>Not a bad pomade at all.</li>
      <li>For the price, it is not bad at all.</li>
      <li>love this product but like other reviewers have already written, the price more than doubled!</li>
      <li>On a more serious note, I like to use this product because it is a great value and keeps my hair in place without looking overly greasy.  </li>
      <li>What I like about this product is it controls my hair very well, even in humid environment, and washes off easily.</li>
      <li>The Suave Professional Styling Pomade is an excellent value and very effective product for thick, short hair.</li>
      <li>This product along with the Suave Men&#x27;s Styling paste produces such an amazing shiny but not oily hair style.  </li>
      <li>Overall, Suave Professional Pomade is a great product.</li>
      <li>I have found that with my hair being about 6\\&quot; on the top now (and buzzed on the sides) that the American Crew Forming Cream works FAR better, and is priced very reasonably here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>If you have thick/coarse and straight hair (the kind that just point upwards if left undone)</li>
      <li>I used to be able to buy this at local grocery stores and chains, but for some reason the pomade is no longer available where I live.  </li>
      <li>Comparing the two, I still like the Crew pomade better, but the difference is negligable for the massive price difference.</li>
      <li>Pretty blah product.</li>
      <li>Even better than the current iteration of AC.  </li>
      <li>First know what this products is and how to compare it.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, it is a hair pomade for a more refined generation, not for teenagers who like hair glue, big bottles of gel, and greasy axe products.  </li>
      <li>light scent, nearly odorless</li>
      <li>This is pretty unacceptable.</li>
      <li>You want a shinny and thick hold (think &#x27;Gone with The wind&#x27; or &#x27;Great Gatsby&#x27;)?</li>
      <li>longer hair American crew works better.  </li>
      <li>If it gets hot out, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do quite as well.  </li>
      <li>Turns out this is nice product, would not be surprised if it is made on same factory where crew is made...  </li>
      <li>The price is good and it works as well as more expensive pomades.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients are pretty much identical, save the fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it seemed reasonable to assume it would be easy enough to make a knock-off product for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>It also provides a pretty decent hold.</li>
      <li>Since I was unsure about pomades, I figured $2.75 wasn&#x27;t much of a gamble.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very close.</li>
      <li>It is reasonably prices product  </li>
      <li>The reason for 3 stars is that 2/4 of my pomade containers were only filled ONE-FOURTH OF THE WAY.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d go by most of the other reviews.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically ultra-thick hair gel, and you need to use a lot of it; I don&#x27;t have that much hair to begin with, and even I had to use almost a quarter of the friggen jar just to get a decent hold on my hair.</li>
      <li>After many years of short hair I finally found this.  </li>
      <li>However, buying four of a smaller product may make more sense than buying four of a larger.  </li>
      <li>In order to get a decent hair dew..  </li>
      <li>In fact, you may just use a tiny bit more of this one, and you will get the same results.</li>
      <li>The initial smell dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>Decent product though.    </li>
      <li>In the future, I&#x27;ll spend the extra money for a better product.</li>
      <li>This is unacceptable and when they ship it, it is missing quarter from the top.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m stuck looking for a new pomade because I&#x27;d rather rock a buzzcut than use any Axe product.</li>
      <li>Most of the time I&#x27;ll use Suave pomade and sometimes I&#x27;ll use the Crew pomade but like I said, it&#x27;s close...  close enough to make me stop looking for other substitutes.</li>
      <li>The first ingredient listed in Suave pomade and Crew pomade is the same</li>
      <li>It performs just as well as the more expensive brand and has a mild fragrance unlike the others.</li>
      <li>Two shampoo washes and it completely</li>
      <li>My hair now is wild as a mustang...  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s considerably thinner than the AC pomade and splits the difference between AC pomade and gel.</li>
      <li>Left my hair very greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>Amazon decided to discontinue this early 2013</li>
      <li>(well worth it, considering the $16 American Crew Pomade that was shelved next to it!).</li>
      <li>Once you zero in on the right amount to use, for the same result that you got with the Crew Pomade, all that remains is extra $$ in your pocket.</li>
      <li>I usually just flip my hair up a bit in the front, and this stuff works just fine.  </li>
      <li>Long time crew customer... find their products great but expensive.</li>
      <li>Now for 30.00 same product and amount.&lt;br /&gt;Thats way too high of a jump.</li>
      <li>use it on my short, finger length hair to provide light hold and tame flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>FYI if u have a Dollar General by you it is sold there for 2.75, however they do not always have it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered two &amp;#34;four packs&amp;#34; of this product and four of the eight containers were open allowing the product evaporate and dry out.</li>
    <li> Product is good. But more expensive than others. Needs to come down in price before I buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this product and the best part is honestly the smell because I absolutely love it.  Since it is medium hold, it is better for shorter and thinner hair so I will be moving on to try out the American Crew fiber since my hair is generally medium length.</li>
    <li> Love this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy. I have been using this product for about 2 years now.</li>
    <li> The pomade works well, it is very similar to the American Crew Pomade in terms of performance.  I recommend the product, however, the description is incorrect.  The product is only 1.75 oz versus 2.5 oz.  Look at the picture.  Surprisingly, Target makes the same mistake in-store and in its ads.  As such, there isn&#x27;t a price differential between this product and others, such as the Axe Pomade.  However, buying four of a smaller product may make more sense than buying four of a larger.  I don&#x27;t need 1 year of product at a time.  Decent product though.    Four stars for performance.  Two stars due to the incorrect description.</li>
    <li> After many years of short hair I finally found this.  Thank Goodness i found it online, because you cannot purchase in stores any longer for some reason</li>
    <li> I have been using the Suave Men&#x27;s styling pomade for well over a year.  You can&#x27;t beat the cost of this product, I was buying it my local Kroger for around 2.50 which was the cheapest around by at least a buck. On my recent journey to buy some they were out, and subsequent visits to Target, and Walgreens found they were out as well.  I think this product has been discontinued, which is a shame because it performs great. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff and doesn&#x27;t leave too much residue.  It also provides a pretty decent hold. I am glad Amazon is selling it so I can stock up now.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product unless you have to buy similar ones for 2 to 3 times the price.</li>
    <li> The Suave Professional Styling Pomade is an excellent value and very effective product for thick, short hair. It performs just as well as the more expensive brand and has a mild fragrance unlike the others. I just dab a small amount on the finger and rub it between my palms and apply the pomade into my hair. What I like about this product is it controls my hair very well, even in humid environment, and washes off easily. I would caution because it has a slight tack, that dust will stick to your hair. Overall, Suave Professional Pomade is a great product.</li>
    <li> Whatever, it&#x27;s Pomade</li>
    <li> First know what this products is and how to compare it. There are two basic types of HAIR POMADE: beeswax or petrolatum based. Both make your hair strands stick together and hold your hairdo in place.  There is no way around the \\&quot;stickiness\\&quot; if the point is to &#x27;stick&#x27; your do in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a beeswax based product and is therefore lighter, less shinny, and easier to apply. You want a shinny and thick hold (think &#x27;Gone with The wind&#x27; or &#x27;Great Gatsby&#x27;)? Then go for a petrolatum based pomade like Murray&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim is that this particular pomade performs as well as American Crew Pomade, well, it&#x27;s dead on. In fact, you may just use a tiny bit more of this one, and you will get the same results. The ingredients are pretty much identical, save the fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect if you hair already has some natural wave or texture, OR if hair is thin and light. If you have thick/coarse and straight hair (the kind that just point upwards if left undone) you need a petrolatum pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with this there&#x27;s no flaking, the smell is light and indiscernible throughout the day. Two shampoo washes and it completely out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, once you have your hair perfectly combed and done, it always helps to use a very light-misy hairspray to really hold things in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the price on this (whenever you can find it) is a steal.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to buy this at local grocery stores and chains, but for some reason the pomade is no longer available where I live.  The price is good and it works as well as more expensive pomades.  Wish they&#x27;d bring it back locally, but until then, I know I can get it through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff everyday.  I was really sad when my local store stopped carrying it, but now I can get my fix.</li>
    <li> USED to be a great product for a reasonable price on AMAZON (14.00 for 4). Now for 30.00 same product and amount.&lt;br /&gt;Thats way too high of a jump. Will be searching for something less expensive for sure.</li>
    <li> This product along with the Suave Men&#x27;s Styling paste produces such an amazing shiny but not oily hair style.  Love it, but I believe Suave is no longer producing this product.  I&#x27;m buying in bulk before inventories run out.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it is as good as Crew Or Bed Head and much cheaper. FYI if u have a Dollar General by you it is sold there for 2.75, however they do not always have it so when they do I buy them out!  JP Orlando</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used pomade, but have been a huge fan of gel.  After watching Madmen I decided to part my hair and wear a retro hair cut.  My hair now is wild as a mustang...  In order to get a decent hair dew..  I needed to apply TONS of American Crew Firm gel.  I became curious about pomade but didn&#x27;t want the greasy mess.  All pomades I found were $6-$19, and their scent were awe full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this at Target for $2.75 loved its smell and price.  Since I was unsure about pomades, I figured $2.75 wasn&#x27;t much of a gamble.  The best part of it all, is that a tiny bit of pomade controlled my truly unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;With longer hair American crew works better.  If you have short to medium long hair Suave Pomade works as good as the expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product in a single pack locally. Now i always/only buy the 4 pack.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product works great and last all day.</li>
    <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t pomade, it&#x27;s utter garbage. It&#x27;s basically ultra-thick hair gel, and you need to use a lot of it; I don&#x27;t have that much hair to begin with, and even I had to use almost a quarter of the friggen jar just to get a decent hold on my hair. Less than half an hour later, my hair was already starting to dry out and get crunchy. This stuff is cheap for a reason, do NOT use it.</li>
    <li> I got it used it and like it. Just wish I had got more, can&#x27;t find it in the store.</li>
    <li> It holds hair in place so well! Absolutely Amazing! I usually just flip my hair up a bit in the front, and this stuff works just fine.  The temperature of the product does seem to effect its performance though.  If it gets hot out, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do quite as well.  But i still have not found a hair-styling product to match this in terms of how well it gets and keeps my hair in place.</li>
    <li> Too bad this stuff wasn&#x27;t available back in the day when they were filming Full House or it would have been Uncle Jesse&#x27;s go to hair product.  On a more serious note, I like to use this product because it is a great value and keeps my hair in place without looking overly greasy.  In my opinion, it is a hair pomade for a more refined generation, not for teenagers who like hair glue, big bottles of gel, and greasy axe products.  Great bang for your buck when you buy this 4 pack too!!!</li>
    <li> I found this at Target for $2.50 or so and decided to try it (well worth it, considering the $16 American Crew Pomade that was shelved next to it!). For the price, it is not bad at all. Does have the tendency to change texture throughout the course of the day and does not hold up to weather/wind/heat terribly well (but it was $2.50, keep this in mind...). Not a bad pomade at all. I kept a tub at work to touch-up my hair if needed throughout the day. I have found that with my hair being about 6\\&quot; on the top now (and buzzed on the sides) that the American Crew Forming Cream works FAR better, and is priced very reasonably here on Amazon. That said, this and the forming cream are not even in the same ballpark, so that&#x27;s an unfair comparison. For the price, this stuff is great and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong..love this product but like other reviewers have already written, the price more than doubled! This is unacceptable and when they ship it, it is missing quarter from the top.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new user to hair products after a lifetime of military haircuts.....this pomade works just right for me, good shaping without being sticky.  This price (once you&#x27;re committed to four containers!) is very good compared to drugstore.  If you know what you want, this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> This hair product is best described as a clear, gummy paste.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my short, finger length hair to provide light hold and tame flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; What I like about this product &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Rinses clean, easy to get off your hands (or hair)&lt;br /&gt;*Affordable (was able to find a 4-pack on Amazon for 14 bucks)&lt;br /&gt;*Does not sting your eyes if you sweat (can leave in hair)&lt;br /&gt;*Hair does not get crunchy&lt;br /&gt;*Can wear everyday (since it rinses out well)&lt;br /&gt;*Can wear to bed without making your pillow gross&lt;br /&gt;*Very light scent, nearly odorless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; What I DO NOT like about this product &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Hard to find in stores&lt;br /&gt;*Price on Amazon fluctuates a lot, best to stock up</li>
    <li> great hair product, doesnt leave any flakes. arrived on time and secured. overall, for the price it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> It has the perfect density and provides good hold for hair. I can only find it on Amazon since stores do not carry it anymore. I think it is a product that is no longer made though it wasn&#x27;t sold at stores for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived at the expected time.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. Its not greasy and if you ride a motorcycle, it is the cure for helmet head. Style your hair in the morning with your fingers and your good to go.</li>
    <li> Sorry - this product isnt for me. Left my hair very greasy feeling. Scent is a bit too over powering IMO.</li>
    <li> It is reasonably prices product  that I think works just as well as the more expensive pomades, like Crew and such.</li>
    <li> A good substitute for Crew pomade and at a fraction of the cost. Once you zero in on the right amount to use, for the same result that you got with the Crew Pomade, all that remains is extra $$ in your pocket. The initial smell dissipates quickly. I tried Brylcream and shea butter but they left my hair limp, as if I soaked it in oil. I didn&#x27;t try Axe anything because everyone complains about the smell, including my wife. The first ingredient listed in Suave pomade and Crew pomade is the same and then there&#x27;s a difference in ingredients. I think the Crew pomade makes my hair a tad thicker, maybe due to the other ingredients but it&#x27;s very close. I have both. Most of the time I&#x27;ll use Suave pomade and sometimes I&#x27;ll use the Crew pomade but like I said, it&#x27;s close...  close enough to make me stop looking for other substitutes. I&#x27;m not cheap but there&#x27;s something brazen about the price of Crew pomade, especially when considering the type of product that it is. I didn&#x27;t experience any of the complaints listed in mr lovejoys review (crunchy, not lasting). I&#x27;d go by most of the other reviews. Competition is good.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to purchase this if it didn&#x27;t claim to be comparable to to American Crew Pomade, but that&#x27;s the basis for my biggest gripe about the product. The American Crew products are wildly overpriced for what you get so it seemed reasonable to assume it would be easy enough to make a knock-off product for a fraction of the price. Well, it&#x27;s cheaper, but it&#x27;s &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; in every sense of the word. It&#x27;s considerably thinner than the AC pomade and splits the difference between AC pomade and gel. It&#x27;s not crunchy like gel tends to get when dry, but it doesn&#x27;t hold up well over the course of the day as either traditional gel or AC pomade. Might be ok if all you&#x27;re looking for is frizz control, but doesn&#x27;t offer much more than that after an hour or two.</li>
    <li> I love this pomade.  After years of trying products, this was the best.  Even better than the current iteration of AC.  But the cost a year ago was less than 14 for the same.  I am disappointed in what seems a gouging  all of a sudden.</li>
    <li> Long time crew customer... find their products great but expensive. I came across this Suave product thinking it is going to be another gimmick.. Turns out this is nice product, would not be surprised if it is made on same factory where crew is made...  I recommend for anyone looking for alternative to expensive hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update as of 10/09/2013** Apparently, Unilever(owner of Suave brand) had discontinued the Suave version of this product. The closest match to this product is AXE Shine Pomade, Smooth Look. Compare the ingredients and it seems to match 90%. So look for the AXE brand, there is a different smell to the product- but it is in fact same product. The Suave version was based on AXE brand (both Unilever brands)****</li>
    <li> used it cause it was cheap at the supermarket. Only holds hair for about... 30 minutes and is useless afterwards. have to keep reapplying all day. Pretty blah product.</li>
    <li> These pomades used to cost about 2.50 at Target mid 2011, then by mid 2012 they discontinued them everywhere I looked. I have no idea why, it smells great, had a relatively decent hold and gave the appearance of semi-wet hair. Eventually this was replaced by Axe products that cost 3-4X the price... Amazon decided to discontinue this early 2013 so I&#x27;m stuck looking for a new pomade because I&#x27;d rather rock a buzzcut than use any Axe product.</li>
    <li> I tried this as a cheaper option to American Crew&#x27;s pomade. In the future, I&#x27;ll spend the extra money for a better product. Suave&#x27;s pomade seems more like a super-thick gel to me. The hold only lasts about half a day and my hair feels quite a bit crunchier than it does with AC&#x27;s. I also need to use a fair bit more of the Suave than I do AC. Note that these are sold by weight - Suave and American Crew are both 1.75 oz - but there is a lot more product in the Suave container (lighter, which I think supports the fact that you need to use more).</li>
    <li> I started using this pomade since American Crew pomade is very expensive. Comparing the two, I still like the Crew pomade better, but the difference is negligable for the massive price difference. The reason for 3 stars is that 2/4 of my pomade containers were only filled ONE-FOURTH OF THE WAY. This is pretty unacceptable.</li>
