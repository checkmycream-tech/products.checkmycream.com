    <li> I liked the smell and the size of the containers. This was a steal on Amazon. The cheapest I found on the market was Target at a whopping 55.00 per set. I bought two from amazon at 60% of that price. The women in our lives were not complaining needless to say :)!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this set from a friend of mine. Absolutely loved it. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the scent but was disappointed when It didn&#x27;t last 15 min. This must be a knock off. Somebody should care more than to sell this crap that&#x27;s going to upset everybody !!</li>

    <li> I got this cologne for my husband. He loved it. It smells great and the price is really good for what you get. I think women can use this scent too. It&#x27;s a scent anyone can use not too strong.    I ordered from Perfumespot. They were great shipping was super fast. Ordered Feb 2, and got my item Feb 4th on standard shipping.</li>
    <li> This smells like aquadeegeeoh not many people can tell the differance. Get it you wont regret it.</li>

    <li> Smells great! The after shave balm makes your skin soft and feel good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 10 years and have bought several bottles in Las Vegas.  This one smells different.  Not worth returning but I won&#x27;t buy online again.</li>
