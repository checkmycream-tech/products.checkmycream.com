      <li>it is easy to use and it made my skin really soft.  </li>

      <li>about this onlie first.</li>
      <li>First of all it works.</li>
      <li>My skin is so clean and baby soft!  </li>
      <li>My skin is so clean and baby soft!  </li>
      <li>My skin is super soft!</li>
      <li>I also tested the directions to wash and dry your face before using the product, by putting it on top of my BB cream.  </li>
      <li>You should see a huge reduction in the beading the second time.</li>
      <li>gentle on face (no burning, chemical sting, allergic reaction,</li>
      <li>gently rub all over face</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so gentle, I bet it will expedite the peeling/healing process.  </li>
      <li>Worked better than expected.</li>
      <li>I have not found it to be overly drying, as some reviewers have, but I have very oily skin.  </li>
      <li>I really like Cure -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so gentle, I bet it will expedite the peeling/healing process.  </li>
      <li>They had a promo recently and I was supposed to get a free cosmetic bag - it didn&#x27;t come with my order.  </li>
      <li>Exfoliated really well.</li>
      <li>I feel my face refreshed again thanks to it ..</li>
      <li>The old skin rolls right off.</li>
      <li>My skin has never felt better with any other exfoliator.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, feels refreshing, can see some peeling of dead skin.</li>
      <li>For example, I put some on the underside of my forearm (a very smooth area) and there was essentially no clumping, while there was quite a bit on the outside of my forearm.  </li>
      <li>Anymore than that, and I notice is dries out your skin too much (causing, yet again, more shedding of dead skin</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>My skin felt so soft and subtle after :) Facial product felt like they absorb better.</li>
      <li>There are many gimmicky products out there that say they &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34;...</li>
      <li>Even better than with Face Green Tea Exfoliator, which I have used before they took it off market.</li>
      <li>Their peel is a few dollars more</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>wow!  </li>
      <li>Not only it is gross, but dead skin cells aren&#x27;t good for you.  </li>
      <li>i highly recommend this to everyone, young and old.</li>
      <li>the first few times your face might overreact by creating more oil, but you&#x27;ll be fine after the first few weeks&lt;br /&gt;- not available in American markets</li>

      <li>it cleans like if a put clear glue on my face</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this until the company goes out of business, after which I will calculate how much I will need to last until age 90 and buy that amount from the company before they go under.  </li>

      <li>I have mild case of atopic dermatitis, always dry, flaky, and red around the corners of my mouth and around my nose.</li>
      <li>This takes all of the dead, grimy skin off of your face, and always leaves me looking fresh and alive.</li>
      <li>But they won&#x27;t because even though this product is expensive, it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> wow!  how come i&#x27;ve never heard of this before?  it is awesome!  the exfolliation is fantastic.  it leaves my face smooth, soft and thoroughly clean!  i use it 2x a week.  i highly recommend this to everyone, young and old.</li>
    <li> I love how it exfoliates and leaves my skin so soft i totally recommend. But my mother tried it and shes is claimining that its not dead skin it is just the slolution turns in rubbery stuff but am loving it</li>
    <li> From the moment I rub it onto my skin, I immediately start to feel all my dead skin cells come off, and my pores unclogging.&lt;br /&gt;This product really lives up to its name, and is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Very gentle, feels refreshing, can see some peeling of dead skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, works very well and better than I expected. I would definitely recommend tis product.</li>
    <li> gives the best results really</li>
    <li> Package came really quickly and I was happy with the product. I have very sensitive skin but this didn&#x27;t irritate it at all. Will be buying again! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this months ago and it is one of the better products I have purchased from Amazon. First of all it works. I&#x27;m 73 and it&#x27;s the best exfoliater I&#x27;ve ever used. For those of you who wonder if the product itself is producing the beads. Take this simple test. Use it as directed, rinse and dry your face and then immediately apply it a second time. You should see a huge reduction in the beading the second time.</li>
    <li> I have mild case of atopic dermatitis, always dry, flaky, and red around the corners of my mouth and around my nose. I have used this 2 times within this week since I got it.  I could never use other exfoliators with beads/granules/crystals or other chemicals  etc because my skin would be inflamed red afterwards.  This is super gentle - did not feel any burning or tingling.  My redness is improving since I no longer have to use vigorous scrubbing motion to get some of my dead flaky skin off my face.  With this exfoliator, no more flaky skin! My skin is super soft! Love this!</li>
    <li> Love it! Its gentle on the skin and my face feels really clean after using it. Would definitely recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m such a fan of this product. I don&#x27;t know how my skin lives without it. I began using it almost 2 years ago... and still swear by it today. It is perfect for those whos skin gets easily irritated. This takes all of the dead, grimy skin off of your face, and always leaves me looking fresh and alive. I always wash my face after ((even though the directions say you don&#x27;t have to)). I&#x27;m glad I bought the 2-pack... I go through them so quickly... This is one of the more expensive items I use in my skin care regimen, but it&#x27;s worth it everytime.</li>
    <li> Ummmm, at first I seriously thought this was a joke. Was that really my dead skin? Maybe it&#x27;s the drying and rubbing of the gel that&#x27;s creating residue/whitish effect. I didn&#x27;t believe it. So I tried it on my dried chappy lips and OMG. My lips were smooth all the dead skin disappeared. I&#x27;m a believer! My skin felt so soft and subtle after :) Facial product felt like they absorb better. Not to mention, my makeup sets on way better. Don&#x27;t massage too aggressively because it can get abrasive. Will definitely buy this forever and skip those microdermabrasion appointments!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it 2 times per week and love the way it makes my skin feel. I have used about half of the first bottle, which has lasted 2 months. A little product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really like Cure - it is easy to use and it made my skin really soft.  I recently discovered something called a 3 minute precision peel on OpenSky (Molly Sims endorsed it there), ordered their product and found it worked better and lasts longer.  Also - the directions are in English!!!!  It&#x27;s made in the US, their ingredients are clearly printed on the label, and their customer service is great.  Their peel is a few dollars more but I&#x27;d rather buy American and be able to ask questions and deal with locals. They had a promo recently and I was supposed to get a free cosmetic bag - it didn&#x27;t come with my order.  I called and they were super nice and sent me the bag right away.  I&#x27;m gonna stick to their peel.....</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as advertised!!!! The old skin rolls right off. This will allow for other products to penetrate the pores.</li>
    <li> evens out skin tone...adore this product</li>
    <li> Love the consistency of the product and the shipment was fast. Took less than a week! Will purchase again.Made my skin look moisturized after use. Exfoliated really well.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and works wonders.</li>
    <li> It is pricey for the quality of the product.  It is too watery and I do not feel as effective as Bio Essence deep exfoliating gel.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and am very glad I did.  Although there is some debate about whether the clumps are skin or the product, I have come down on the side of it being skin for a few reasons.  The most compelling reason is that the clumps themselves vary based on where I put the product on my body and whether I&#x27;ve exfoliated that area recently.  For example, I put some on the underside of my forearm (a very smooth area) and there was essentially no clumping, while there was quite a bit on the outside of my forearm.  I also tested the directions to wash and dry your face before using the product, by putting it on top of my BB cream.  Nothing happened at all - no clumping, no exfoliation, nothing, even though I could tell my skin was quite dry.  I washed my face, reapplied the Cure Natural Aqua Gel and BAM, dead skin everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also feel a difference immediately.  For example, I have dry patches on my arms, as well as on the back of my calf where I cross my legs, and this product has been very helpful in reducing those patches.  I use this product on my face about every other day, depending on how my skin feels.  I have not found it to be overly drying, as some reviewers have, but I have very oily skin.  I love this product and wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
    <li> All the reviews I&#x27;ve read are super accurate. It leaves my skin feeling so smooth after using just a bit of it. I use it twice a week and it is very gentle on my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My skin never felt this clear and bright. Just loving it</li>
    <li> very very good . not only use it on face. for feet also very good .</li>
    <li> this is okay. thank you</li>
    <li> I use this regularly and Amazon is truly my only source. I love the way it treats my skin and keeps it extremely clean. I recommend it highly. It is not the &amp;#34;shell game&amp;#34; others seem to believe it is.</li>
    <li> Worked better than expected. My skin has never felt better with any other exfoliator. Even better than with Face Green Tea Exfoliator, which I have used before they took it off market. The downside with Cure Natural Aqua gel is that it has to be shipped all across the globe which makes it very expensive for me.</li>
    <li> Use as face scrub, to cleaned dirt, make-up, my acne, and even dry die skin.  Love this product, it liked gel based.</li>
    <li> How do I begin to describe just how ridiculously awesome this product is.  Seriously, I have NEVER come across anything like this before.  Let me explain the situation:  I live in Savannah, GA (hot, humid south), and occasionally return to Denver, CO (dry, cold west).  When I go from tender South to rugged mountains, my humidity-pampered face shrivels up and dries like paper.  I spend days peeling skin until my face re-adapts to the dry climate.  Not only it is gross, but dead skin cells aren&#x27;t good for you.  They cause acne and whatnot.  UNTIL NOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW IT WORKS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- wash your face with hot water and facial soap as usual&lt;br /&gt;- pat dry with a towel&lt;br /&gt;- pump a tiny bit of Cure onto fingertips&lt;br /&gt;- gently rub all over face&lt;br /&gt;- keep rubbing...until all your dead skin peels off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t freak out.  It&#x27;s not chemically stripping your face off.  It&#x27;s hydrating all that dead skin until it&#x27;s supple and moist enough to roll into a ball.  As you massage your face, the dead skin clumps into tiny beads on your face.  Be careful not to smash those beads of dead skin back INTO your face.  Just rinse them off your fingertips.  When you&#x27;re done, just splash water on your face until the beads come off.  DON&#x27;T, I repeat DON&#x27;T, try to scrub them off.  It&#x27;ll just collect back in your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a week to help remove dead skin.  Anymore than that, and I notice is dries out your skin too much (causing, yet again, more shedding of dead skin cells).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- super easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- gentle on face (no burning, chemical sting, allergic reaction, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;- mostly water, so safe for people with sensitive skin like me&lt;br /&gt;- no perfume or scent&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use pump gives you just enough (doesn&#x27;t waste)&lt;br /&gt;- lasts forever (I&#x27;m 1&amp;#34; down the bottle after a month)&lt;br /&gt;- works like you cannot believe&lt;br /&gt;- fun factor (my sister and I were giggling like crazy while using it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the price!  oh, the price...&lt;br /&gt;- takes a while to arrive (about 2-3 weeks for mine)&lt;br /&gt;- can dry out your skin unless you use infrequently and follow up with face cream as soon as you&#x27;re done&lt;br /&gt;- the first few times your face might overreact by creating more oil, but you&#x27;ll be fine after the first few weeks&lt;br /&gt;- not available in American markets&lt;br /&gt;- no samples to try (but it does work...trust me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this until the company goes out of business, after which I will calculate how much I will need to last until age 90 and buy that amount from the company before they go under.  But they won&#x27;t because even though this product is expensive, it&#x27;s amazing.  I still don&#x27;t get how it works.  Just water infused with gel and some amazing recipe.  My skin is so clean and baby soft!  I can&#x27;t wait to try this on a future sunburn.  It&#x27;s so gentle, I bet it will expedite the peeling/healing process.  Five stars without a doubt.price!  oh, the price...&lt;br /&gt;- takes a while to arrive (about 2-3 weeks for mine)&lt;br /&gt;- can dry out your skin unless you use infrequently and follow up with face cream as soon as you&#x27;re done&lt;br /&gt;- the first few times your face might overreact by creating more oil, but you&#x27;ll be fine after the first few weeks&lt;br /&gt;- not available in American markets&lt;br /&gt;- no samples to try (but it does work...trust me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this until the company goes out of business, after which I will calculate how much I will need to last until age 90 and buy that amount from the company before they go under.

    <li> this thing gets all the gunk off your face without damaging the skin. it does what it says. its just way over priced when the ingredient is mainly water! :(</li>
    <li> I love it .. it&#x27;s really magical product .. I feel my face refreshed again thanks to it ..</li>
    <li> OMG..... This stuff is too good to be true but is is.  You apply this to your very dry face after washing your face and let it sit for a minute...little white spots start to show as this starts to dry start rubbing your face gently to rub off all dead skin...then rinse your face ...you&#x27;ll see a difference in your face right there and then.  You can even use this on your body.. Take your regular shower and dry off...stay in the shower and use one pump per body part and exfoliate...then rinse off...your skin will be immediately softer.  There are many gimmicky products out there that say they &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34;... But this is the REAL DEAL!!!</li>
    <li> it cleans like if a put clear glue on my face and then i wash it with water all that glue will come off like in little balls on my hads... is sooooo weird.&lt;br /&gt;i defenetly will not spend 60  bucks on this again.&lt;br /&gt;reserch about this onlie first.</li>
