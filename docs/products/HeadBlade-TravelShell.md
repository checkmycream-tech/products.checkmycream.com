<li> It&#x27;s tough and cool looking.  </li>
<li> Now I don&#x27;t sweat the small stuff when it comes to protecting my blade when I&#x27;m on the go thanks to the Head-Blade case.  </li>
<li> It keeps my blade dry and protects it from anything that I might be carrying in my bags for the day.  </li>
<li> I even have other dudes who shave</li>
<li> Not too big or too small.</li>
<li> Not much to it, the blade and another small bag accessory fits well - protects when in travel.  </li>
<li> A WASTE OF MONEY.  </li>
<li> However, you can&#x27;t find small packets.</li>
<li> I left the Headblade alone, sad because I just received the item , even got the case.  :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A sturdy holder for the HeadBlade.  I doubt the razor would break from pressure while in this holder, especially if put in a checked bag for air travel.</li>
    <li> Its better than a razor but could be better.</li>
    <li> At some point, I know I&#x27;ll have to travel with my HeadBlade Sport, and this product will let me travel knowing confidently that my razor will not be damaged.</li>
    <li> Perfect for shaving a bald head!!!</li>
    <li> Case fits my HeadBlade nicely and will protect it when I throw in my workout bag. I only wish they included the little head lube container that would fit in the back mesh pouch. That way I could refill the container with my larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift but the person really likes it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivered, very nice!</li>
    <li> Item was received as described.  Fast shipment.  ++</li>
    <li> The razor left my head with bumps and I&#x27;ve never gotten bumps on my head before. I left the Headblade alone, sad because I just received the item , even got the case.  :(</li>
    <li> Works well, high quality, great durability and functionality.</li>
    <li> So my boyfriend ordered this because he decided to go bald.  he loves the razor and travels back and forth from my place to his, and he decided to get a travel case for it. Nice and durable, and still in great condition.  very worth the money</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product. It is firm, but not rigid, so it will squeeze a bit  if it gets wedged into a travel bag with more stuff.&lt;br /&gt;And, I like the elastic strap that hold the blade in the shell when it&#x27;s opened.&lt;br /&gt;But, I think it could have been made a little smaller, more closely fitting the head blade itself.&lt;br /&gt;This won&#x27;t be a problem on most trips, but sometimes space is at a premium in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;When that happens, I might just clip the protective plastic cover that the blades come with back on, and place the head blade into my bathroom kit without this travel shell.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this shell is being used for larger blades than my ATX. Maybe.</li>
    <li> my husband loves it the razor fits in it perfectly</li>
    <li> Does the job, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband and he loves it. It&#x27;s easy to use and it gives him a nice smooth head!</li>
    <li> Perfect for that quick on the go blade essential...Store&#x27;s just the right items you need...You won&#x27;t find a better case....I like it !!!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome.</li>
    <li> Great case!  I shave at the gym, so this travel shell is perfect for me.  I love the shell and the shaver.  Two thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect to keep all my shaving gear together. Great for packing in my suitcase when taking a trip.</li>
    <li> Great travel shell just perfect for the razor and some small travel packets of HeadBlade Lube. However, you can&#x27;t find small packets. You&#x27;ll have to make them I guess.  Or carry the bottle of Lube and Glossy (or whatever you prefer) in your doppkit.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Fast shipping!  Sturdy and stylish case with inner strap to retain headblade, and extra storage pouch with plenty of room for extra blades.</li>
    <li> Not much to it, the blade and another small bag accessory fits well - protects when in travel.  Does what it claims...</li>
    <li> I love this case!  Since I purchased the NEW version of the Head-Blade I find myself shaving my head more often on daily basis.  Since I&#x27;m now shaving my head every day, I like to take the Head-Blade to the gym to shave in the shower.  This case has made it more convenient to carry the blade in my gym bag and my travel bag as well.  It keeps my blade dry and protects it from anything that I might be carrying in my bags for the day.  It&#x27;s tough and cool looking.  Carrying my Head-Blade was a bit of a hassle before, because I didn&#x27;t have a good case for it.  Now I don&#x27;t sweat the small stuff when it comes to protecting my blade when I&#x27;m on the go thanks to the Head-Blade case.  I even have other dudes who shave they&#x27;re heads asking me where can the get one..  It&#x27;s just that cool.  Thanks Head-Blade!</li>
    <li> Lots of room for handle, blades, and accessories. Nice case.</li>
    <li> A WASTE OF MONEY.  VERY FLIMSY CONSTRUCTION.</li>
    <li> Got this as a b-day gift for my brother (to go along with the HeadBlade) who loves it. He likes the convenience having this nice case that also has compartments for extra blades. The case is well made and the perfect size for traveling. Not too big or too small. I wouls recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my HeadBlade damaged by the cleaning staff at a hotel, so I make sure to put it away in my TravelShell... problem solved.</li>
    <li> neat way to travel with  the Head Blade</li>
