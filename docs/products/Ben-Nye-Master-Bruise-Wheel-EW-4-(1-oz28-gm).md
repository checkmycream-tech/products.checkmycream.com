    <li> The very best. Easy application, frighteningly realistic, perfect colors. I used this for a music video shoot recently - one of the extras posted a photo of her makeup on Facebook and was getting calls from frantic, concerned friends asking if she was okay! Says it all, really. This bruise wheel plus a coarse sponge gives incredible results with very little effort.</li>
    <li> It is Ben Nye.  That should be all that needs to be said.  For beginners learning to do theatrical makeup or professionals, there is no brand that is more consistent in quality than Nye.  The bruise wheel is a more difficult tool to use than other makeup items because getting just the right color for bruises is hard and it takes time to learn.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Came really quick!! Worked great on halloween</li>
    <li> Perfect, just perfect. Not a thing to complain about.</li>
    <li> Good substitute for the illustrators palette and low budget makeup jobs. Colors are very pigmented and for the size of each color the price is not bad at all.</li>
    <li> My favorite wheel. Great colours, easy application, I would recommend you watch a video if, you&#x27;ve never made bruises or used ben nye for you to get nice life like bruises.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use though, and it lasts with some sealing.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation is caused, at least not on anyone I&#x27;ve used this product on.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of zombie work and this is the best bruise wheel I&#x27;ve found.  Bruises are super realistic!</li>

    <li> Bought this for my daughter for a theatrical dance and it truly makes real looking bruises and applies nicely with a make up sponge. Also washes off well.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am a beginning artist and wanted something cheap and good quality. I am on a budget and found this product while scrolling. I wasn&#x27;t sure wether to buy this product or not, not knowing wether it is good quality and lasts long. I bought this a year ago and still have plenty left. It definitely met my expectations and I would buy again. Must have product here!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for zombie makeup, and it works great! The colors blend well, and the bruises look realistic when applied properly. Also, it is a great value compared to other brands. Would definitely buy from Ben Nye again!</li>
    <li> I first used this in my theatre class in high school. I&#x27;m very pleased with it and it&#x27;s a perfect size and lasts quite a long time for the money. Creates realistic looking bruises and injuries quickly and easily. Anyone can do it.</li>
    <li> Love this bruise wheel the colors are great and it&#x27;s easy to apply -- quality makeup!  Would buy anything from Ben Nye!</li>
    <li> I needed to become a zombie, &amp; while my friend (who does special fx makeup) was tutoring me on how, I still needed makeup of my own. He used the bruise wheel, so I bought one. The quality is excellent and the effect is amazing! While making wounds is sort of an art-form, good makeup is essential. If I need a refill, I&#x27;m not switching brands.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! Perfect palette for bruises! Such a good price for such an amazing product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for a casual special effects application. It can be hard to get a perfect bruise but it&#x27;s still highly effective and my friends are getting pretty tired of me giving them a heart attack with all my fake bruises haha. It looks really good on camera.</li>
    <li> The yellow doesn&#x27;t stay yellow for long. Once you get a bit of color too close to the middle the yellow sucks it up and changes. Also, I don&#x27;t know why they added green to the pallet...I&#x27;ve never used it and I don&#x27;t think I will ever use it for a bruise. But it is a great infection color (for those zombie lovers)&lt;br /&gt;It does a wonderful job at coloring a bruise on skin. Once you put it on (as long as it&#x27;s used pr</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing SFX make up to the past 3 years and I love Ben Nye, this works very well for bruises, cuts, and burns. This only problem I&#x27;ve had with this is that it can be difficult to remove, especially if it has been set with powder.</li>
    <li> My daughter does theatrical makeup. This bruise wheel does the trick! Make up goes on very smoothly. Great product at a great price point!</li>
    <li> Used for Halloween.  it was awesome.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. blends well. will be great for me to do zombie make up for this halloween.</li>
    <li> I received this color wheel yesterday and had to play with it a bit.  I love the realistic colors in this bruise wheel and can create some very realistic bruising.  Its easy to apply and stays put with a little translucent setting powder. I put a bruise on my leg and showed my hubby and he thought it was real. Asked me what in the world I did to my leg. I cant wait to use this on the neighbors kids for Halloween this year.</li>
    <li> Really does the job! With a little bit of technique, you can really make yourself look bruised. You can also use the colors as eyeshadow, if you want. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth every penny. If I ever need more stage makeup, I&#x27;m sticking with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend one of those little black spongey things to paint the colors on. Put a picture of the kind of bruise you&#x27;re going for next to the mirror for reference.</li>
    <li> Using a stippling sponge and a few minutes with a mirror I am able to look like I just went 7 rounds with Mike Tyson. Can create very realistic bruising effects. Also like that this product doesn&#x27;t have an shine to it making it blend in well with the skin and liquid latex that I use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both this and the Mehron for bruises and I&#x27;d go with the Mehron.</li>
    <li> Very Pigmented, colors are easy to apply and blend.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing wheel... I&#x27;ve been using it as practice and I absolutely love it. The brusing looks real! If I ever fun out of makeup, I&#x27;ll be definately repurchasing this. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this wheel! I did a make up look with it with bruises and cuts and got so many good comments saying how real it looked!</li>
