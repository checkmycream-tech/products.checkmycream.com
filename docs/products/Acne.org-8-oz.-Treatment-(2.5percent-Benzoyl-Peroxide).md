<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 and have had mild to medium acne my entire life.  I have tried everything under the sun.  This is the only product that has worked for me and I can&#x27;t stress enough how awesome it is.  If you use it EXACTLY how the directions say then it&#x27;ll work.  I&#x27;ve been using it about two month now and have just integrated the AHA+ (10% Glycolic acid + Licochalcone)  and I like it so far as it really helps to add moisture back into your skin.  Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Still by far the most amazing product ever for me. It&#x27;s been a life changer - definitely my miracle in a bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this treatment and the entire regimen to anyone with problem skin, that just needs a fresh start. It is sooo worth it :-)</li>
    <li> This is the third or fourth time I&#x27;ve bought this product (the first time I bought it individually). To put it simply, it is the only product that had worked for me. Before this I tried everything to get rid of acne all over my face: clearasil, clean &amp; clear, clinique, neutrogena, chanel, holistic remedies, medical treatments from two different dermatologists, home-made remedies... everything. I live in a city in the middle of the desert so the weather is horribly hot, and to make it worse my skin is oily all over. It wasn&#x27;t until I found this in the acne.org website that I decided to give it a try and now this is the only treatment I use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this treatment for seven years or more. I was lucky to find out about the regimen in high school before I was left with a lot of acne scarring. I don&#x27;t use it twice a day, but I typically use it at night and then spot treat with it during the day. This is a great amount of BP for a good price.</li>
    <li> Is the second time I&#x27;m buying this product and I&#x27;m really really happy with it. It&#x27;s amazing , it really works . I&#x27;m free acne now! I recommend it to everyone that suffers with acne problems</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing !! you want to get rid of your acne in 2 weeks? this is the product for you</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month. Actually, I use it along with the proactiv cleanser because I happen to have a lot of that cleanser. I like this more than the proactiv repairing lotion. My skin is pretty hardy (I have been using pretty harsh products for about 10 years), and the acne.org treatment does not make my face red or dry (I do not use lotion with it, though I have it...maybe I will start...) Since I have been using this I haven&#x27;t gotten a single new pimple (knock on wood).</li>
    <li> I have used so many acne treatments and Benzoyl Peroxide is the only one that has any effect on my skin whatsoever. This is the cheapest and most effective out of all the products I have used. I highly recommend acne.org&#x27;s products and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I am very thankful for this product. *teary eyed*  I have two 16 oz bottles and one 8 oz bottle.  The 8 oz bottle was sent to me free with a cleanser and moisturizer.  I panicked when I left my bottle behind and quickly ordered more.  I&#x27;m going to hoard them in my bathroom so I don&#x27;t run out.  The 8 oz is a pretty decent travel size.  I would fill it up and have it ready for vacations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works better than oxy clinical which has a 5% benzoyl peroxide.  That cleared my skin up too, but had more peeling than with the acne.org 2.5%.  That was why I was researching better products and up came acne.org&#x27;s 2.5% benzoyl peroxide.  I still have the 5% benzoyl peroxide, but am sticking with the 2.5%.  I only put Dan&#x27;s BP on my T zone.  The sides of my face and cheeks are sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enough BP to last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a little over 3 weeks now.  I am going out without my make up on and feel like a more natural confident woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much love to Daniel Kern &amp; to all the reviewers that helped me find great products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Erin~</li>
    <li> Love it.  Everyone else has said all that needs to be said.  Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t flake or cream up.  Gentle enough with my sensitive skin that dries out to just warm water touching it.  Really good price considering how huge the contain is.  Buy it and you will love it too.</li>
    <li> Stop spending your money on other products this is the only thing that works for me. Murad proactive acne free clearasil dermatologist nothing worked. Just give it a try.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to write this review until I finish up my entire tube of the 8 oz. treatment, and after a year, I&#x27;ve finally used it all up. I use it twice day and it still took me a whole year to finish the 8 oz, so it&#x27;s well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I started breaking out like crazy three years ago. I tried so many different acne products, ranging from drug store to the more expensive &amp;#34;dermatologist recommended&amp;#34; treatments, but this is the only one that has worked for me. I didn&#x27;t use the acne cleanser or moisturizer, but I still got good results in the end.&lt;br /&gt;First, you have to know that this product will not work immediately. It took two or three months for me to actually start seeing improvement on my skin. And after using it for around 6 months, my face was 100% clear of acne. I do get a pimple once in a while, but it&#x27;s generally really small and goes away in two to three days.&lt;br /&gt;Second, this product will dry out your skin even though it claims it won&#x27;t do that. You need to find a really good moisturizer to even out the dryness or else your skin will be incredibly irritated, and that might even cause more pimples. I had to change my face cream a few times because the regular face creams couldn&#x27;t moisturize well enough.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this product works if you&#x27;re patient enough with it. I don&#x27;t even follow Dan&#x27;s instructions strictly, but it still worked for me. If it&#x27;s not working for you, just be patient and keep trying. It should work in a few months. :)</li>
    <li> I use it 2-3 times a day, it reduced my hormonal acne by 60-70%, so I will buy it again. The dryness appeared only during the first week of use.</li>
    <li> These products are not ground breaking, b/c I have used very similar products in the past, but his prescribed regimen is.  After eliminating my harsh 5% bp and sticking w/ DK&#x27;s advice for 3 days, my skin has finally started to turn around.  I am quite surprised that a gentler bp is doing a better job than my stronger treatments.  Even perpetual under the skin bumps, that wouldn&#x27;t budge, are finally packing up and heading out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must mention that I am not using it exactly as prescribed.  Applying BP prior to adding moisturizer was too irritating for me.  My current routine is first DK cleanser, then Moisturize (Decleor Iris Night Balm),  add a light layer of DK&#x27;s AHA all over, then spot w/ DK&#x27;s BP to trouble areas.  No irritation, only results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to deal with some mild acne around my chin. I also get the occasional painful cyst-type acne (I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and this is a recent development).I have pretty sensitive dry/normal combo skin and other treatments I have tried have just made me peely and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the treatment for a month.  At first the treatment was a little drying so I went to using it every other night and now I am applying it every night following it up with moisturizer.  My skin is DEFINITELY clearer.  The product is easy to apply, soaks into your skin pretty quickly and is unscented (a huge plus!)  It is still a little irritating everyonce in awhile but I have not had any ridiculous peeling/redness.  I&#x27;m still not sure how it will be under my makeup wearing it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am impressed with this product, it has helped out my skin!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, and while it takes a while to start working, the results are wonderful. A month later and I have no new acne, just old scars. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> If you follow Dan&#x27;s regimen at acne.org -- or any of the rip-off regimens available like it from Clean &amp; Clear, Physicians Formula, etc. let alone Proactiv -- then you know 2.5% benzoyl peroxide (BP) works as well as 5% or 10% but without horribly drying your skin (or, worse, drying it out so badly, your skin cracks and bleeds or oozes where it is cracked (yeah, that what happened to me on a regimen of topical antibiotics, 10% benzoyl peroxide, and 1% Retin-A cream that were all RXed together by a dermatologist!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great 2.5% BP. It&#x27;s more like a cream than a lotion, so it&#x27;s not runny and it stays where you put it. It doesn&#x27;t leave a hugely heavy white residue on your face (depending how much you use). And it doesn&#x27;t have extraneous irritating or allergy-causing ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the misfortune of having mostly dry or very dry skin WITH adult acne, especially prone to breaking out with a couple deep, large acne cysts around \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot;. In the past, I was RXed 5% or 10% BP (as mentioned above) which harmed my skin much more than it cleared up my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since learned that 2.5% is the way to go. It works just as well as the 5% or 10% but without all the complexion-frying harshness of those two higher concentrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Dan!</li>
    <li> I am extremely grateful to Dan Kern for creating this.  I remember when I started college and all my friends&#x27; teenage acne started clearing up, and mine didn&#x27;t.  I would try to cover it up with makeup, but then I was just caked with makeup, which was as embarrassing as the acne I was trying to cover.  I suffered a lot about my continuing acne until I was 21 years old and found this product and started using Dan&#x27;s regimen.  I had tried many prescription combinations of things like Retin-A, adapalene, and clindamycin, as well as every over-the-counter thing I could find.  None of them worked except the high-concentration over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide (BP) creams, but I always had an allergic reaction to BP where my face would turn red.  So I had to choose between acne or a red face -- not ideal.    Then I found this product, which is Dan&#x27;s low-concentration BP gel.  I used a large amount of it at first, as he suggests, and for about a week my face rebelled -- I was red and peeling and (I hate to say this, but) I lied and told people I had gotten sunburned because I was so embarrassed about the real reason for my peeling.  But then, it all calmed down as my face got used to it.  My face didn&#x27;t stay red, and my acne started clearing up.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it -- NOTHING had budged my acne for 10 years.  Within about two months of starting to use this, I had only a couple of active pimples at any one time.  My skin hadn&#x27;t looked that good since I was a little kid.    Since then, there have been a couple times when I have stopped using this for a month or two, due to laziness, facial dryness, and/or hoping that my acne would finally have decided to graduate from my adult self.  Alas, as soon as I&#x27;ve stopped, my acne has come back.  This proved to me that the clearing of my acne with this product was not just coincidental with my finally growing out of my acne.  I&#x27;ve started using a much heavier (non-non-comedogenic, gasp!) face cream under the BP gel and the dryness problem was solved (and I haven&#x27;t gotten any breakouts from the cream).  I now use this BP treatment gel every single day, and do not anticipate stopping it in the next 10 or 20 years of my life.  I now get about 1 pimple every 4 months as long as I&#x27;m using it.  Dan&#x27;s BP gel has literally eliminated the biggest source of insecurity about my appearance that I have ever had; I regularly leave the house without makeup now.  It&#x27;s inexpensive, with virtually no side effects beyond the first week or two, it doesn&#x27;t make my face turn white when I sweat (as many OTC BP creams do), and it&#x27;s hard not to appreciate Dan&#x27;s inspiring story and reason for making this cause his life.  Highly, highly recommend.  (For the record, no one is paying me to say this -- I am an enthusiastic customer who really appreciates this product.)</li>
    <li> You cured this 59 yr old woman with cystic acne all her adult life, 2 rounds of accutane. I have not had a cyst in months and the occasional little whitehead i may see, is easily popped. thank You!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have to say acne.org has the best products for people who suffer from acne and major skin problems. It does not hurt to try, its worth it for the amount you pay. Be patient and you will see a world of a difference. Everyone&#x27;s skin works differently so do not expect immediate results. Patience is a virtue and you will see. I love this stuff so I can never go back to regular drug store garbage.</li>
    <li> Make sure you use a non-greasy moisturizer in addition to this gel. It can dry out your skin and irritate it if you don&#x27;t use a good moisturizer. I keep buying this because it works without drying out my skin. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of additives like the Neutrogena cream does. Just good old bp in a water based solution (I think). Don&#x27;t quote me on that though. Added tip: follow the regimen that acne.org describes, and you should notice a difference in the clarity and smoothness of your skin within days.</li>
    <li> This, as well as all the acne.org products, works great and seems to have high quality ingredients at a relatively low market price. It dried out my skin, but didn&#x27;t make it flaky, and really should be paired with the acne.org moisturizer. A lot of the complaints I&#x27;ve read about concerning the moisturizer in reviews probably stems from the fact that the two are designed to be used together synergistically. I&#x27;m 35, and my acne problems are largely in my past, but every once in a while I get ingrown hairs from shaving on my neck or jaw line, and this really helps. More than anything it helps control the black heads and oily skin I&#x27;ve dealt with since puberty. My all too common nose blackheads are completely gone after a couple of weeks, to the point that my nose will actually show small, craggy wrinkles between the much smaller pores before using the moisturizer, since there&#x27;s nothing clogging them anymore. Since my acne problems are minor, I only use this before bed and a couple of days a week, switching out the acne.org AHA product 4 or 5 days a week. All together, I have to say that I&#x27;ve never had such great looking skin. I didn&#x27;t have any real issues with irritation, either.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried dozens of products over my life, and most were much more expensive, including Accutane (which I wouldn&#x27;t recommend before trying this, due to life long side effects), and so far this seems to be the best. I did a lot of research in journals, etc... and, the producer seems to have put in only the best ingredients with clinical evidence of being highly effective. So to recap, I&#x27;ve only used this in combination with the other acne.org products (it&#x27;s not to be used without a good moisturizer), but I don&#x27;t just have normal skin now, I have really great skin. At 35, I have the skin of a guy with good skin in his early 20&#x27;s. I still use oil control sheets daily, but that&#x27;s because my skin oil releases naturally, rather than getting clogged in my pores, and any residual oil seems to add a glow that is manageable, rather than just bad oily skin.a glow that is manageable, rather than just bad oily skin.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years and it&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I was first hesistant trying out this product because it was online &amp; something I would not consider cause I don&#x27;t want to break out even more.&lt;br /&gt;Because I had so much active breakouts here and there I decided to buy the treatment &amp; seriously, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using it to long, about 2 weeks in a half, and so far I really like it. I believe it is effective, &amp; it stopped frequent breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Like I use to have like a new pimple every other day or at least something like that, but with this treatment I believe I somehow managed to control my pimples. I&#x27;ve been eating quite healthy too so that might be something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I think people who are interested should try this product!</li>
    <li> For the buy, the bulk of this product is awesome if you require using copious amounts of it. Otherwise, I would caution that BP can be unstable and can lose effectiveness over time. Regardless, the pricing for the available size for those of us who need it is great. Gel-like consistency, absorbs well. Reminder - all BP products can stain clothing &amp; hair because of the peroxide. Be mindful when applying and allow product to fully absorb before making contact with other materials.</li>
    <li> I started experiencing very stubborn, painful cyst-like acne on my jaw line a few years ago (I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s) and was at my whits end.  I tried ProActiv and experienced more breakouts; Clinique&#x27;s skin care line helped some.  I happened upon this product a few months ago when searching the net for acne solutions.  I am so please with the results-within a few weeks of usage, my jaw line has completely cleared.  I am loving that this product absorbs completely (some other BP products that combine with moisturizer tend to leave a sticky residue).  I, too am like some of the other reviewers in that I have not used it exactly as prescribed-once a day seems to be enough.  I have had some dryness around my nose and lips, so I just avoid those areas when applying.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how thankful I am this product exists. More than the product I am especially thankful the website exists because it&#x27;s the process that really does the trick. I had acne that wasn&#x27;t severe but I don&#x27;t want to say it was mild either. I am now in my 20&#x27;s and wish I had had this earlier in my life. My face is finally clear of acne after 2 months of using the product along with clear &amp; clean face wash and clean &amp; clear moisturizer. I used the acne.org moisturizer and cleaner but I didn&#x27;t like it. It works but I don&#x27;t like how it feels on my face. I substituted it and kept using the BP treatment and like magic it worked! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I Abosolutely love this product.. it works, period after years and years of trying EVERYTHING on the internet, in stores, home remedies..this product WORKS!... the only downside i see is that it really dries you skin out.. so use the moisturizer. The moisturizer is very light, not greasy at all. Best money I have spent on any beauty product</li>
    <li> Massive tube, very effective.</li>
    <li> this did wonders on my cystic acne, but it irritated the rest of my face. My forehead is usually smooth and poreless looking, but this covered my forehead in teeny, tiny bumps - not acne, but definitely an irritation. I limited use of this to my chin/jawline area where I get cystic acne, but it wasn&#x27;t good enough to repurchase. Worth a shot if you have acne all over, but too intense for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll stick with my Caroline Hirons inspired regime.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for a couple of years,it rocks (and now neutrogena, acnefree and other brands are copying this regimen, just copy paste!!) stay with these, the original</li>
    <li> I thinks it&#x27;s good if you can use benzoyl peroxide, it&#x27;s definitely a good deal compared with buying small tubes at&lt;br /&gt;the store. My son developed an odd rash using it so it didn&#x27;t work for us. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the benzoyl peroxide because&lt;br /&gt;he had a similar rash with prescription medication.</li>
    <li> I am 28 years old and after the birth of my son I had persistant acne. I was using cleasil 10% all over my face but that became really expensive. This works just as well as the clearsil but it did not clear my skin 100%. I still get rather large pimples but it does help them clear quicker. This is easy to apply has very little odor. All in all I would say this is a cost effective solution if you use benzol peroxide on your fase but don&#x27;t expect a miracle cure.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from acne for quite some time now, although this past year it has gotten worst than ever. It had gone so bad that i would never leave my house without having to cover it with makeup or something. I at first saw very little product, and YES IT DOES DRY YOUR FACE. I have dry skin already but don&#x27;t apply this all to your face, only apply it where the pimple is. I feel like when i started using this product i was using a lot of product to the point my face felt quite wet, but I feel like with a tiny bit on your finger and rub it on your acne it works better. My skin has improved soooooooo much, I wouldn&#x27;t mind leaving my house without any makeup on. Although it took like a month or so to see major results, this with the clean and clear spot treatment have made so much of an impact.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several concentrations of leave-on benzoyl peroxide treatments and this, by far, has been the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says on the acne.org site that it&#x27;s been proven that concentrations over 2.5% don&#x27;t really improve skin any better, and I&#x27;ve seen that to be true. 10% was entirely too strong, causing painful dryness and cracking on my face. 5% also caused dryness (obviously less than higher concentrations) and I could never find the right balance of moisture. Salicylic acid doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment is perfect for my skin. It works well, quickly, reliably, and doesn&#x27;t cause bothersome dryness. I&#x27;ve had this tube for about three months and I haven&#x27;t even used half of it (and I use it at least once daily) and that is something I really appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as it keeps working as it is, I&#x27;ll keep buying. Holy grail product.</li>
    <li> Great BP formulation. I try to stay pretty close to the regimen and am getting good results. I am enjoying it!</li>
    <li> Only thing that works on me &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> So I followed the instructions, but I&#x27;m not really seeing a difference. I may just have to chalk this up as &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t work for me, but my work for you&amp;#34; situation. I honestly think it&#x27;s just going to depend on what your skin responds to. That aside, Dan does know his stuff. The process of skin care he encourages makes sense and I&#x27;d suggest checking out his site and at least &amp;#34;listening&amp;#34; to his advice, if only to provide you with another perspective on/approach to proper skin care.</li>
    <li> My daughter,12, and I, 46,  have tried everything out there including prescription strength treatments for our acne. Some methods worked a little better than others but the acne.org Treatment had, by far, the best effect. When we started, she had 5-6 pimples on her forehead and several starting on her chin. Since using it two times a day after washing her face she has only one dried up blemish left. Needless to say she is thrilled. I suffer from all types of blemishes in specific areas. When I started the treatment, I had about 7 blemishes with other starting to form. After one week of use, i have one blemish and no new ones forming. I really like that it is not drying to my face. Thank you, Dan!!!</li>
    <li> I have not used it on my face yet, but after 1 week of applying to my back, I can say it&#x27;s a miracle product! ? My back is completely clear of acne and the skin feels very soft. the first 2-3 days the skin felt a little bit itchy and dry, but now my skin does not feel dry or itchy any more and it looks and feels completely free of acne. the next step is to try it on my face and I&#x27;m looking forward to it.</li>
    <li> First off, I have just about the craziest skin you can possibly imagine, and I don&#x27;t think it always used to be this way.  I used to just have regular whiteheads (few blackheads) and some red discolaration around my cheeks, nose, and forehead.  I used Proactive for about 2 years and while it worked I was worried about the chemical cocktails in those little white tubes.  I also wanted a cheaper alternative that worked just as well.  When I stopped using Proactive my face blew up with worse acne than I ever had before; we&#x27;re talking a minefield of deep, painful, under the skin cystic acne and whiteheads.  I&#x27;ve had hangovers from two-day drinking benders that weren&#x27;t this bad.  I began trying a lot of different products, all for a few weeks at a time to make sure I was giving them the benefit of the doubt.  I tried organic as well as synthetic products, and nothing was helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lot of research I discovered that it was the combined effect of AHA (glycolic acid) and benzoyle peroxide that helped my skin achieve its proper balance.  The only secret ingredients to Proactive Solution are glycolic acid and benzoyle peroxide.  Nothing else.  Their cleanser is crazy irritating and any medication in a cleanser gets washed off anyway so it&#x27;s completely useless.  The repairing lotion is the real miracle worker because it is a topical application of benzoyl peroxide which helps calm and exfoliate the skin.  Dan&#x27;s benzoyle peroxide treatment is gel form which goes on a lot smoother and is accepted by the skin with less resistence.  There&#x27;s also no fragrance like with Proactive (which between you and me gave me a headache).  D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan will tell you this, too, but while benzoyle peroxide will help clear up your skin, glycolic acid will make it look perfect.  The reason is because glycolic acid helps exfoliate and encourage cellular regeneration.  Once you get the acne under control with benzoyle peroxide, you may even be able to shift to only glycolic acid, although I recommend using both to start.  Now, when it comes to glycolic acid, this little gem of a chemical can sometimes be hard to find as the main ingredient.  I highly recommend Dan&#x27;s AHA lotion, which features glycolic acid right at the top of the ingredients.  For those of you who don&#x27;t know, ingredients listed first are most present in a product and they decrease in percentage as you near the end.  So, you get a bang for your buck by having Dan&#x27;s AHA lotion because Glycolic Acid is listed at Number 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you, like me, have some Proactive left over, feel free to finish up the Repairing Lotion and even use the Toner as your stand-in for AHA.  Proactive Toner&#x27;s main ingredient is glycolic acid, listed also as the second ingredient, and it&#x27;ll do the trick for a while.  This toner is also rather interesting because it&#x27;s alcohol free, so unlike most toners it does NOT dry out your skin (a good thing when using benzoyle peroxide and AHA together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s the clincher that took me forever to figure out...  I have oily skin.  Yea, big deal, just like everyone, right?  No.  My skin is like superskin because it can create enough oil to completely remoisturize within an hour or so.  Now, for 25 years I was always led to believe this was bad and that I should moisturize to control it.  Epic...Fail.  Your skin&#x27;s oil production is a natural process that should not be stopped or added to but it should be checked.  I use an organic bar soap to clean the skin, then do an application of AHA, benzoyle peroxide, and then...aloe vera gel.  I do NOT use lotion moisturizers because they clog the heck out of my skin and only add do the oiliness - even jojoba oil disagrees with my skin.  All I need to do is buy my skin the time to remoisturize on its own, so aloe vera gel (incredibly soothing and instantly refreshing) helps moisturize in the now and slowly lets my own skin take over.  The result?  NO acne.  I&#x27;ve even been able to significantly reduce the amount of benzoyle peroxide I put on my face.  On acne.org, the origin of this benzoyle product, \\&quot;The Regimen\\&quot; dictates a very ample dose of benzoyle peroxide.  While this may work for some, if your skin is like mine and just hates having anything on it (makeup, lotions, martinis, a light breeze, etc), then do the least amount you need to.  Figure out what your skin wants and give it.  Mine is very oily, which is a blessing and a curse, so I learned how to keep it in check with this product combined with AHA and aloe vera gel only.  NO moisturizer except aloe vera gel, and my skin is a happy camper.  I hope this helps!xide I put on my face.

    <li> This is gentle enough. I have sensitive skin, so at first I only used it every other night (for about 2 weeks, in which I already noticed some clearing). Now I use it every night (only) and that&#x27;s enough. No strong odor or funky texture. Just use white pillowcases and crappy shirts to sleep so nothing precious gets bleached.</li>
    <li> Best kind of acne treatment I have ever used! I saw results after just one use and it got even better the more I used it! But a caution for people who have sensitive skin, it will make your face red and dry. At first this happened to me but after a day or two, the redding and dryness stopped. I only used this but I heard if you used the whole set it&#x27;ll works wonders. One day I&#x27;ll buy the set but for now I&#x27;m sticking with just this as it works amazing already!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I&#x27;ve been a BP (benzoyl peroxide) user for nearly 10 years now. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have full on, all over acne, more like 2-5 zits going on at any given time with very sporadic clear times. I&#x27;d like those sporadic clear times to happen more often. I used Proactiv BP for about 7.5 years before getting tired of the price &amp; mandatory subscription service. I then tried Paula&#x27;s Choice BP for another 1.5 years. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference between the 2. Both were somewhat effective, but were not clearing me the way I wanted to. Which led me to do more acne research, and thus to acne.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing the Regimen for 6 months with the Acne.org BP (2.5%). I&#x27;m not sure WHY this BP dries me out / causes so much more irritation than other BPs I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it does. I feel like I&#x27;ve given it a fair shake, but after all this time I can still only apply a little bit once per day (and some days not at all, when my skin is super dried out &amp; irritated). I think this is partially why my skin is not as clear as I want it to be. It&#x27;s also the only BP that makes my eyes burn - not that I am applying anywhere near my eye, but must just be the &amp;#34;fumes&amp;#34; from it being on my skin.  I feel like my actual breakouts are about the same as they were before, but that my skin is in worse shape between the more clogged pores and the itching/irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I don&#x27;t buy the &amp;#34;I just need to give it more time&amp;#34; argument as my skin was well used to BP when I started using this product. I would say that my skin tends to be more on the sensitive side. I would be wary of this product if yours is, too.</li>
    <li> Ordered to the UK, only took 1 week to arrive, and I&#x27;m absolutely happy with the product! Hands down beats the old (discontinued) Panoxyl Gel 2.5% I was using before. No skin irritation, spots go very quickly as part of the regimen. All at a good price for the amount you get, even when you take into account the international shipping. Can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> Perfect, smooth treatment. My skin is naturally beautiful and acne, breakouts, and blemishes are a thing of the past</li>
    <li> Cleared up my acne. I wish I had gotten ahold of this years ago. Google acne.org and you can read all about it. Amazon has cheaper shipping for the moment.&lt;br /&gt;Still a really generous amount of product THAT DESTOYS ACNE as long as you fallow the directions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now, I put it on when ever a pimple pops up, it helps it go away in a few days, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Is a long and tedious process, but once your skin starts getting used to the product it works like magic, the downside is that is almost like an addiction, if you stop using it you&#x27;ll get the acne again, at least for me.</li>
    <li> First I loved it but after two months I have a skin ulcers and i left it</li>
    <li> I bought this cream after reading the reviews. I was badly infested by itchy pimples on my scalp especially neck hair line. The first thing to cease was itching, and the pimples took cover just after few times of application. It has not bleached my hair yet though my towel was greatly discolored. It really works  and i recommend this cream to anybody who wants to eradicate acne.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know you could buy Dan Kern&#x27;s acne products on Amazon. I have been buying them from his site for several years. The Treatment is a very good deal when you break it down to typical 1-oz. tube pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can sum up by saying this DanKern benzoyl peroxide is unscented, goes on smooth and light, and absorbs in well, with no white residue or excessive dryness. I think my skin is clearer using it twice daily than it has been in a long time. It feels a lot like a moisturizing lotion, perhaps a bit thinner. And it is a great deal. I usually buy 2 or 3 of the 8 oz. tubes at a time, so it lasts 6-9 months (to save on shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a family history of oily skin, my dad and grandpa had it, and it flares up with lack of sleep and stress, of course. I have used a number of products over the years, and had some pros and cons. The Dan Kern treatment is 2.5% Benzoyl peroxide, enough to help but it is less drying/irritating to your skin vs. 10% strengths. I can see great improvement with its use, and it really helps in the wintertime or in dry climates, as it helps hydrate your skin. You can also get a 2-oz. size for travel, backpack or purse use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I&#x27;ll use the DKgel (let&#x27;s call it that for brevity) on my whole face (+/- neck or shoulder problem spots if needed) every night, and in the mornings I use a combo of Neutrogena&#x27;s 2.5% Benzoyl peroxide on my nose and forehead (they are a bit more oily, that seems to control shinyness that way), and the DKgel on the rest of my face. If I get a particular blemish then I&#x27;ll use a 10% benzoyl peroxide product right on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things to do are be very gentle when washing your face, and when applying any of the creams. Smooth them in but don&#x27;t rub aggressively (your skin bacteria can get shoved into the pores). Also don&#x27;t pick at your face (not so easy), don&#x27;t lean on or rub it either. Also it helps to change your pillow case very often, or I use an old t-shirt on top of the case, one side one night, flip it the next, then the third night a different shirt (to decrease the oils from my hair and face on the pillow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, long review, but what I also like that helps my skin is the Neutrogena daily acne wash (the one that is orange, with salicylic acid in it). I use it on my face morning and night. The salicylic acid helps increase skin cell turnover (they use it for plantar warts as well, but that is higher strength), to maintain a clear complexion. And for shaving I like the Gilette gel, sensitive skin, it has aloe, etc. but no oils in it. Be sure when shaving to go with the hair growth, not against it (or you can get ingrown hairs/lumps more often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you use a face sunscreen look for oil-free varieties. Sorry for long post but maybe my experiences can help others through the maze of options. I haven&#x27;t done much food research yet though... but yes thumbs up for the DKgel benzoyl peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Feb. 2016:&lt;br /&gt;I was preparing to reorder today, and read some reviews. You know, my skin is more clear overall, but it does seem very dry, even after using facial moisturizer. I am not sure if I should trial a different product, or perhaps try just once daily instead of twice daily? I have to think about it some more, maybe my skin is getting more dry after the 40&#x27;s... hm.en the third night a different shirt (to decrease the oils from my hair and face on the pillow).  Okay, long review, but what I also like that helps my skin is the Neutrogena daily acne wash (the one that is orange, with salicylic acid in it). I use it on my face morning and night.

    <li> This is the best price I have found anywhere on 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, which is important to me because I use a ton of it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know a single product that actually stops acne. I put this on and it does dry out the skin, but doesn&#x27;t stop my acne. At best maybe slows the growth but never stops.  Any current acne is not affected as far i can see which makes me think this stuff never can get rid of acne that&#x27;s begun.  It can only minimize the growth of acne.</li>
    <li> I recommend buying a smaller tube if your acne is less than/moderate. It worked better than drugstore brands. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a great product.  It is a generous amount for the price (except for shipping, but that&#x27;s a given).  I find this to be as affective and much more gentle than the drugstore product I was using (which wasn&#x27;t bad).  The acne.org system has  worked great for me twice.  In between I gave up for a year or so assuming I had finally grown out of acne - I am middle age.  If you decide to do this, follow the plan, be gentle and don&#x27;t hesitate to moisterize.  This advice has worked wonders for me.  Thanks Dan!</li>
    <li> It keeps my face SOOO clear! This stuff saves my life, just be sure to get a good moisturizer and get the jojoba oil or you&#x27;ll be flaking all over the place.</li>
    <li> ANCE.ORG is a miracle! I just use the product for 1 week on my forehead(not that serious but, always there) and most ances disappearred! although they are not completely treated so far, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
    <li> First off, let me just say that I never write reviews for anything, but I feel obligated to share how grateful I am for this product. I have tried what seems like every product out there since I was a teenager and nothing ever worked. Proactiv may have come the closest but only seemed to keep my skin somewhat controlled. The acne.org regimen, inluding this 8 oz. treatment, has completely cleared my skin- and as a result, has kept me from picking at my skin (which has been a problem for me for years). I realize that different products work for different people, but for me, after trying so many things for so many years, this is the product that I would suggest trying out. Waking up in the morning and not having to immediately worry about putting makeup on to cover acne is a surreal feeling for me - I&#x27;m still getting used to it. Thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after suffering from adult acne all of the sudden. I used to use proactiv and I was fine then it stopped working, being a bp user I figured maybe I can try this, it&#x27;s a good product, but it really really dries my skin and it stings, weird cause I have used bp all life whether in clearisl or proactiv. I don&#x27;t use this product everyday, I now just use it as a spot treatment to dry up or decrease the pimple size.</li>
    <li> I have mild acne (forehead, temples) and occassionally get cystic pimple aaround that time of the month, but it took only a few weeks for me to see results. Since I have combination skin (oily/dry combo), I put less of the benz. peroxide on my cheeks and much more on my forehead/temple area. Even though the instructions says use A LOT and to follow the instructions to a T, you have to see how your face reacts from the getgo and do a little tailoring to your skin&#x27;s needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, BIG POINT- The benzoyl peroxide will bleach EVERYTHING it comes in contact with ESPECIALLY when you are sleeping. Oh, one more thing, you will notice that hair will be bleached. I have the thickest ( it&#x27;s a dark brown, almost black ) hair you can imagine and it bleached it rather quickly. So if you have thin hair, act quickly and cover your hair from the start of the regimen. I don&#x27;t mind a few red and blond hairs, but to those who do, cover your hair when you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a product that is straight forward and does the job.</li>
    <li> The amount of product you get for the price, is amazing! This product has lasted me for 5 months and that&#x27;s using it 1-2 times a day. I have been using 10% benzyl peroxide for spot treatments and that seems to be effective for more so then salicylic acid. This product contains 2.5% BP and using it as an all over face treatment doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all and it&#x27;s very effective. I mild acne and I see more changes using this product then other over the counter ones. I still have some break outs here and there but my skin has cleared up significantly. If you are suffering from acne, try this product out and read the regimen from acne.org, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> This has completely got rid of my acne in 3 months :) even the acne scars are reduced. I used it with the acne.org regime</li>
    <li> I was really pleased to see this product being sold on Amazon, not just Acne.org, since I wanted to try the regimen, and had an Amazon gift card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I am using Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser Normal to Oily Skin and Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture Combination Skin with this Benzoyl Peroxide treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had major acne problems, so I don&#x27;t feel like I see a huge difference (which is why I rate a 4), but I know it works, and it all leaves my skin feeling very fresh and clean!  It is a generous amount, and definitely dries the skin effectively (be careful NOT to get it near or around the eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered nine days after I ordered; not bad!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still working on those little &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s gone down considerably since I&#x27;ve mixed in an exfoliator! This is the best acne treatment I&#x27;ve ever used and has taken away about 85 percent of my scarring on my back!</li>
    <li> A $20 miracle!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! I bought this out of sheer desperation nearly a year ago and this is the ONLY product that worked to clear my teen daughters severe acne. We spent years trying everything and NOTHING worked until this!  She uses only this one product one time at night and it works like a charm without drying her skin out. She now has beautiful clear skin and we are so grateful! We found early on it must be used every night to keep acne from popping back up, but if she happened  to miss a few days and IF a pimple cropped up, DO NOT PUT THE MEDICINE ON AN OPEN PIMPLE to treat it, because it caused her pimple to enlarge massively with nasty weeping for about 2 days. She found if she waited until the next day to apply product  to a newly popped pimple, it would be cleared within a day or so without a problem. This tube has lasted nearly a year.....worth its weight in gold!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to find Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%, much less at a reasonable price. This product has cleared my skin without drying. I use it every day and haven&#x27;t had any problems since I started. Happy to find it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The value and price are excellent. OTC BP products are way more expensive and come in itty bitty bottles. This is definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is suppose to dry up your skin ? Using it for about a month now and it has not helped my acne one bit. Very disappointed considering how much I paid for it</li>
    <li> Works well, a lot less drying but still does the job.  Thank you for a great product. Will continue to use these products.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product, and it did reduce pimples, but i found that after a couple of weeks of using it everyday, my skin started to dry out and get flaky and even look a bit aged. And that was only when i was using it on the problem areas not my whole face. Ive heard that it works really well for some people, so i suggest that if you do buy this, get a really good moisturizer that will lock the moisture in and use it on the actual problem areas, not on your whole face. Rating 2/5 (:</li>
    <li> I  was very disappointed with this product because it made my skin stiff and uncomfortable.  I am not able to use it because it makes my skin too dry.</li>
    <li> I did not like the texture. No result with in 3 weeks of using this. Made me oily. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I get decent sized acne once a week mostly around the mouth and cheek area and have been using all kinds of&lt;br /&gt;products off the drug stores.  It worked temporarily but it didn&#x27;t work out eventually.  This product however,&lt;br /&gt;seems to work.  the location type of gel absorbs easily after putting it on the skin and has much less irritation compare to other benzo products.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and it&#x27;s been working well.</li>
    <li> I ordered from the UK and it arrived in a week. Amazing too as it came the day my previous bottle ran out. This stuff is amazing, keeps my skin clear and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. An absolute god send. These guys are the answer to acne problems.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this for people who have ongoing acne. They sell a really good cleanser too. I have been using this product for a few years and would be lost without it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this over 2 years. I get minor break-out throughout year and this reduces my acne from getting worse.</li>
    <li> Seems to really work well on my kids acne, whereas nothing over the counter from drugstores worked at all. Good amount for price too!</li>
    <li> Despite myself living in England, this product was delivered very fast! I&#x27;ve been using this for around a month and I can honestly say it has saved my skin. Definitely will be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, works great!</li>
    <li> Works great, does dry your skin out but thats why you need to buy the moisturizer, and I would recommend the Jojoba as well. Follow the Regime!</li>
    <li> Not a good choice for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> It is the best acne treatment I have ever used. better than the cream based vanishing formula from Neutrogena. no over drying, no white residue, no flaking after smiling or eating, no other feeling except being happy. Thank you Mr. Dan very much for giving your entire years of experience to us so we can reach the 100% clear skin in ONE month. &amp;#34;This is just awesome&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> WARNING: This product will EASILY bleach your clothes! I can&#x27;t stress this enough! Use this before bed and make sure you are already wearing your sleep shirt. As even pulling the shirt over your face will be enough to bleach the shirt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, this product works wonders for me! 2 months of this and my acne has almost all gone! It also seems to clear up redness and scars as well! Even if it bleaches clothes, I would still give this thing 5 stars. Clear face and a couple bleached shirts over acne face anyday</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Cleared my skin in about a week. It sis cause some pretty excessive drying in that first week, but after that my skin was clear and smooth. The only problem is that you really have to use it every day to see results. This is not for the lazy, got to sleep without washing your face type.</li>
    <li> The only regime that has worked for my son . Even the doctors prescriptions didn&#x27;t work ! This product is amazing when used with the cleanser , moisturizer and treatment together .</li>
    <li> Keeps those pesky spots at bay. Regimen: spectrogel, 2.5 Benzoyl, and live clean moisturizer</li>
    <li> The cap must not have been on all the way becase when i opened the package at least have of was all over the inside of the package.</li>
    <li> Best BP money can buy. Period.</li>
    <li> This helped me clear up my acne along with following the guidelines from the rest of the acne.org regime. I didn&#x27;t use their cleanser or moisturiser, I substituted them for my own sourced in the UK (Nivea sensitive in the daytime, Cetaphil with jojoba oil mixed in for the evening, and Dove soap to cleanse. I had been using Liz Earle Cleanse and Polish for a few years, but gradually developed acne, cystic and painful. After being on the acne.org website I decided to ditch Liz Earle products.Their advice was anything that is abrasive to the skin is damaging, and I think that&#x27;s what happened to me, using muslin cloths twice a day was aggravating my skin so much. After being on the acne.org regime I began to clear up in the first week. Its now been almost two months and my skin is so much better, the texture is soft, I have hardly any new spots and the hyper pigmentation left by the acne is slowly fading. I can only get 10% benzoyl peroxide in small tubes in the UK so ordered this from America. Really worth it, its a huge tube and the 2.5% formulation is an effective level for the skin with a refreshing light texture. I&#x27;m really glad I found the acne.org website, the regime has really changed my skin and I recommend anyone struggling with their skin to give the regime a go.</li>
    <li> This stiff works great for clearing up blemishes but I feel like it&#x27;s aging my skin a bit or drying it out. I started using it less often so my skin wont appear so dry. If you are worried about your skin drying out,  just dab it on each blemish and I&#x27;m sure it will work wonders.</li>
    <li> great product,doesn&#x27;t leave face red like a 5% benzoyl peroxide i used to use but does the job as good,,generous size tube as well so last as wee while.,fast delivery to europe i got got mine a week later!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this stuff twice and both times I ended up discontinuing use. It does nothing for me. I&#x27;m going back to my Proactiv. :(</li>
    <li> Using this for 3 months resulted in a temporary improvement with acne, however, overall skin quality went way down. I also experienced the return of acne, extreme dryness, and clogged pores. Stopped using it and since then I&#x27;ve taken a food blood test (find out which foods I&#x27;m allergic to), improved the air quality in our house (before it was awful -- you couldn&#x27;t leave a water bottle open for over a day without it tasting terrible), moved to organic foods, and finally switched my line of cosmetic products to DR. ALKAITIS; specifically their cleanser, treatment oil, and soothing gel -- all on Amazon as well. My skin is looking much, much better now with zero acne.</li>
    <li> For the longest I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne, since 6th grade. I&#x27;ve used so many products with no type of positive or long time effect. At first I didn&#x27;t believe acne.org system was doing anything for my skin, I didn&#x27;t have the time or patience. I wanted great results and fast! So I stopped using the regimen, after a while my skin took a turn for the worst. Constantly breaking out, pimples everywhere, nothing seemed to work. I got to a point in my life I felt like I had nothing to lose anymore, and started the regimen again. And OMG it&#x27;s amazing!!! It&#x27;s been about 5 weeks now, my skin isn&#x27;t 100% clear yet, but it&#x27;s about 80%. My skin feels so much smoother and softer. I also began using Dan&#x27;s AHA+ and it&#x27;s helped my skin improve more, I hope while using it I will see some improvement in my dark marks. If that happens I will feel completely content with my skin. But I definitely recommend this, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful! I think the consistency is at least as nice as proactive, but maybe even nicer. I don&#x27;t care for the acne.org moisturizer or face wash, so I use cerave products for both, and have been extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my daughter&#x27;s complexion in about 3 months.  I am very happy with the product and would recommend giving it a try!!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin, so acne was always an issue. With five days of use larger bumps have become smaller, and small bumps under the skin have almost entirely cleared away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like another one of the reviewers, must admit that I am not following the regimen exactly though. The treatment is gentle enough, and my skin oily enough, that I have not felt the need for moisturizer. I am still using a facial wash once a day to keep my skin clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased. I have had no irritation and my skin is clearer than it has ever been! (And I have tried many other treatments, including antibiotics and prescription washes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this treatment to anyone with any sort of acne issues.</li>
    <li> I was so depressed when I was using Neutrogena&#x27;s 2.5% benzoyl peroxide because my face would always be a dry, peeling, flaky mess no matter what moisturizer I used!!  This product is much better. It is still drying, as any B.P. treatment is going to be, but it just glides on so much smoother and is considerably less drying. I get a little bit of dryness but not the peeling, awful-looking skin I had. On top of all of this, it works wonderfully! I feel like my skin actually looks not only clearer but healthier and more vibrant!</li>
    <li> I always had clear skin in high school but once i turned 20 yrs old my acne came with a vengeance. it was horrible!! I tried everything!! Dermatologists, Proactive, almost every over the counter product you can buy! i searched acne remedies on YouTube and stumbled across acne.org.  If you follow the instructions, this does work! I have been using this product for over a year now and once in a while ill get a whitehead that is easy to pop.. going from cystic acne to that(ill take it!) This stuff is truly amazing! I highly recommend this product, and don&#x27;t give up on it if you don&#x27;t see results right away! And, its VERY important that you moisturize!! This will dry your face, but i promise if you stick with it, it does work!! Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> I went to acne.org and used the face washing methods he described and began using only 2.5%  benzoyl peroxide instead of unknowingly frying my skin with 10% benzoyl peroxide.  I have always been prone to breakouts, especially in the summertime in hot, humid Houston, TX.  I am also prone to facial folliculitis due to waxing, and the small boils/cysts also are healed and prevented by using 2.5% benzoyl peroxide.  There is no other brand that I have been able to find that has only 2.5% in the formula.  The brands in the grocery store and at the drugstores are all 5% or higher.</li>
    <li> This product quite dry in the first time when using. But after using it for 3weeks your skin will adjust itself</li>
    <li> Love this product and will keep buying it!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this did not work out for me. I did not see any result. I have purchase this twice but never finished the tube. I have better results using Persa gel and Laroche Posay Effaclar duo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost a year now and I&#x27;m still loving this... It does wonders for my skin which was otherwise acne prone...</li>
    <li> My aunt recommend it and its been great. Keeps my skin clear for months on end and heals up the occasional breakout really quickly.</li>
    <li> My acne has been a source of embarrassment for a long time. Even on birth control, I still manage to start breaking out in the winter. I did not believe a gel like this would help, but it does work. Within a week, the area on my forehead calmed down and it is clearing up. This product is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try Dans bp and ordered this on here to be shipped to the uk - I was truly amazed at the size of the tube it will last for ages! really great value shipped to me no extra charges I will definatley use this all the time its amazing stuff</li>
    <li> Tough to find a better product at such a good value. I have been using this for years and nothing come close to your bang for your buck</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I haven&#x27;t had a blemish in months (although it took a few weeks to work, which is to be expected.)  It also feels so smooth on my skin, unlike Neutrogena&#x27;s On-the-Spot treatment, which always leaves my face feeling itchy and tight.  I will say that I don&#x27;t use the treatment exactly as recommended (I only use it at night and use a salicylic acid gel during the day for blackhead control), but my results have still been great.  I plan on using it forever!</li>
    <li> Great product... I will recommend to anyone. Can be a bit harsh if you have sensitive skin and dry out skin. However, great product- so if you have sensitive skin just use a little. Great product though. I have sensitive skin and still use it.  Don&#x27;t over do it, can actually change your skin color.&lt;br /&gt;Actually the whole line of Acne.org products are great, especially if you have bad acne. Check out Acne.org website for more information. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve Been using this BP since 2010, it really does work but you just need to follow the regime so precisely. And you will see results :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had acne for 10 years across my face and body it&#x27;s been a nightmare, this has been a miracle for me&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the dryness it causes, it really can make your skin appear older because of the elasticity it looses.</li>
    <li> best working acne so far for 2 years i been using it</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use it morning and night after cleansing and before moisturizer, which is consistent with the acne.org regimen. While my skin is not perfect, after a few weeks of using this product my breakouts were dramatically reduced. If I accidentally skip a day, I tend to break out again. I recommend using this treatment extremely consistently for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a gel product, which is easier to spread than other benzoyl peroxide treatments I have used. It also does not turn white on skin so it is more convenient to use during the day than a cream benzoyl peroxide. Be forwarned--it will bleach whatever it touches! My towels and pillow cases have definitely been affected, but it&#x27;s worth it for the improvements in my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from the UK, and since Panoxyl Aquagel was discontinued, I&#x27;ve been using Quinoderm - but that stuff leaves chalky smear marks wherever it&#x27;s applied. It also takes forever to apply, and has a horrible chlorine-esque odour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS stuff on the other hand, is just like the aquagel I knew and loved: fast absorption, no unsightly residue, and more or less odourless. You can apply it very gently, and it still absorbs (which is important, because being rough with your acne is a good way to make it worse). Works out about the same in terms of price as the old aquagel (though it comes in a bug ol&#x27; tub which makes it seem pricier, plus postage to the UK. If you&#x27;re from the US, it probably works out cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also arrived something like three weeks before it was due to according to the postage calculator, but YMMV there of course, depending on where you live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I received my item two days after I ordered it. I can&#x27;t say much about the product just yet cause I just started using it, but my friend said this is the best one yet for acne treatment (:</li>
    <li> Really pleased with product &amp; really large size tube which will last weeks! Even with postage costs from USA this still works out really good value for money &amp; Ill definitely be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> this works, it controls acne. not as harsh as the proactive stuff. If you get a negative reaction to proactive, try this. we had bad reaction, and tried a handful of stuff. then gave this a shot since it wasn&#x27;t expensive. now acne is mostly gone and in control. use everyday, consistently, and you will see within 30 days a difference.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream of its type i have used.  It does not irritate like others and goes on/in very smoothly when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just started using this particular brand, but know that BP works for me and expect good things given the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> This product does clear up ur acne, and also u save a lot of money because it last a long time</li>
    <li> This is the best BP we have ever used. Thank you Daniel. It is light and absorbs quickly, as well as prevents breakouts. It is not harsh or bothersome to the skin.  Love the whole line.....the joboba oil too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks. Catharine</li>
    <li> Been using for 8 years. Works well on my skin and helps keep it clear.</li>
    <li> This benzoyl peroxide is the best I have ever bought.  Because it is a low dose product it does not irritate and yet is extremely effective.  It also has a more gel-like texture, so it spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; up like the Neutrogena product does.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> since i did not have the full set it did not work because i couldent afford it&lt;br /&gt;right now in my budget</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for benzoyl peroxide. Most of the competition sells smaller bottles that are easy to lose. This product is very hard to lose, it doesn&#x27;t include any irritating ingredients, and the company doesn&#x27;t test on animals. I will be buying this again. (Side note: I found out about this product thanks to Paula Begoun, &amp;#34;The Cosmetics Cop&amp;#34;. If you are interested in skin care, you must see her Beautypedia reviews!)</li>
    <li> Having tried various products with varying BP content, this is the only one that seems to show any improvement on my acne. As long as I keep applying it, acne seems to reduce. And it is totally absorbed in a few minutes, which is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Only benzoyl peroxide product that worked for me. And I&#x27;ve tried tons. I only buy from acne.org now.</li>
    <li> best thing for bacteria caused acne, doesn&#x27;t do anything for clogged pores or ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> It really works along with the moisturizer,  give it at least 3 or 4 months to work.  Ive tried everything and only accutane and this works.  But I had to stop acutane because it became too expensive for me.  This is the best thing, hope it works for you as well.</li>
    <li> This review needs to stay simple - I only review things I REALLY like that I get from Amazon.  This product works as advertised, is  inexpensive, and lasts for a long time.  I wish everything was like this.  I also wish I had discovered this in my late teens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got lazy and stopped using it every night, just in the morning, and I had break outs again.  This stuff needs to be used 2 times a day for me, along with Stress Free Neutrogena face wash in the morning and I have no problems with break outs if I do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line, you should try this product and stick with it for 2-3 solid weeks 2 times a day.  I bet you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
    <li> nice cream, not so harsh on the skin and pleasant texture. I have tried many but this is just great</li>
    <li> may be too drying for some people but continuous use (regularly over at least one month) helps for sure. Works on cystic acne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30 and have had spots for as long as I can remember. I was 25 when I discovered Benzoyl Peroxide cream 2.5% however this was discontinued in pharmacies just over a year ago in UK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this cream based in its reviews and can confirm that it seems identical to the cream/gel that I used to buy. It works very well indeed and because it comes in a large tube, will last me a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks acne.org</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was in college. After one of my favorite products was discontinued, I decided to give this product a try due to the easy return policy. I don&#x27;t follow the regimen that is suggested by the website, but I tailor the use of the Treatment for my own needs. I wash my face 2-3 times a day, apply the treatment, and a moisturizer. I would highly suggest using a moisturizer with sunblock. Benzoyl peroxide is known to dry-out the skin and make it photosensitive. I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend using any other products with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid (it may cause your skin to dry-out or become irritate).</li>
    <li> I was using the proactiv repairing lotion, but it was just not worth the price. I hear about this product and decided to try it out. I use about a 50/50 mix of this and Cetaphil lotion, and it works even better than proactiv. Any higher concentration would tend to bleach clothes and irritate, but this has worked extremely well. I bought it over 4 months ago, and I am worried it might expire before I am done using it......I say this as a testement to how much you get, which is a lot! I looked forever for something to use, went through a dozen other products, but this is the best. Do yourself a favor and try it out.</li>
    <li> I swear by this product. I had suffered from acne for about 3 years and tried countless products before finding this on the acne.org website.  I was doubtful at first, but I figured I&#x27;d already tried everything else so why not try this too. I&#x27;m so glad I did. The first month and a half of use was a nightmare, my skin was super dry and irritated, but after I added jojoba oil it recovered nicely. The only times I break out now is right before my period.  I never thought I&#x27;d have smooth skin like this again.</li>
    <li> Works well. Takes one to two weeks for you skin to become accustomed to it.</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s a lot of product and is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have mild acne and the product made it improve, but it did not completely go away like I would like it to. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;m only using it once a day before bed. I did not want to use twice a day, like they suggest, because it dries my face.</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars simply because it works . Easy to apply . I suffered with acne since I was 10 years old , I&#x27;m now 29. Started using this in 8-2014 and ill admit at 1st it seemed to actually make my face worse but I continued using anyway and I messeged Dan and he said to try using more , well my prob is , my face dries out very easy so he said use more of the lotion too, again I was scared to use his lotion but did what he said , used more 2.5 ben perox and more lotion and also did what he suggested and got the jojoba oil to help better moisturize my skin , and guess what my face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in over 15 years. My skin still does get dry but I can handle slightly dry skin over cystic acne all over my chin. This stuff works. Thank you Dan for a great product</li>
    <li> i have try many things to clear my acne and nothing has worked until i found this on acne.org and decided to buy it on amazon at first i didnt want to buy it because its 30$ for the 8oz. bottle but i wasn&#x27;t disappointed i really love this product and i will keep buying it because it really helps my skin if you use it correctly if it doesnt word for you its because your doing something wrong.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF DOES THE TRICK! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to benzoyl peroxide, so I use a lot less than what they recommend, and only once per day, but it works. So happy to have such a big squeeze bottle of this. I wish it was sold in stores, though.</li>
    <li> I bought this product when it was packed in a small bottle and the price was much lower. It was very effective for treating acne and it will be gone the second morning after applying it just once. Then I found this one became the only package available. Too much for those who rarely have acne problem but definitely is worth the price</li>
    <li> Based on my experience from using this stuff I came to the conclusion that it didn&#x27;t really help my skin at all &amp; it will mess up your skin in the long run. My skin is oily/sensitive/acne prone &amp; I noticed this caused some fine lines &amp; my skin still gets some dry flakes of skin every now &amp; then even though I&#x27;ve stopped using it for some months now. Weird thing that even though I never put this on my lips, it caused them to get dry flakes every now &amp; then as well. I exfoliate to get rid of the dry flakes but after a while I notice them again, which I never had this problem with dry flakes of skin or any fine lines before I started using this. I wish I&#x27;d never used this stuff, but I wanted to help my skin clear up from the acne but instead it caused more problems. Now I&#x27;m looking into using Argan oil from Voila Naturals in hope that it will help improve my skin from what damage this product caused.</li>
    <li> An effective but drying cream. Only cream that appears to be effective for me, my first and preferred choice. I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Excellent treatment for acne .</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two years and it works very well for me. I use it at night on my whole face, and occasionally as a spot treatment during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found acne.org when I started getting regular pimples due to a change in hormones (damn birth control. Ladies know what I&#x27;m talking about.) I knew this product was working when I started getting regular compliments on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daily regimen includes Aveeno Ultra Calming foaming cleanser, acne.org 2.5% benzoyl peroxide treatment and Neutrogena oil free moisturizer for combination skin. If I change up just one of those products all hell breaks loose on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin did dry out a little when I first started using the treatment, but it quickly returned to normal (without blemishes) and now looks and feels silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the label, website and reviews mention, this is a peroxide based product and will bleach fabric so be careful what you wear when you apply it. Don&#x27;t get too attached to your sheets and towels either. I think its a small price to pay for the confidence you will gain in your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had really bad acne through out high school and last year I discovered this product and fell in love. It really helps dry up and prevent acne. Seriously the best product out there to treat as well as prevent breakouts. I must have repurchased this over 10 times and will continue to. I love this stuff! Everyone should give this a try!</li>
    <li> I am an adult who has had acne for decades now.  I&#x27;ve really had no success in handling it until I tried this. I think it is the lower BP content that does it.  I put a good layer over my face and back once a day and now pimples are rare.  No longer do I get giant craters.  It did seem to take about a month to really get working, but since then I have felt so much better about my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with this to keep my face from drying out:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m so disappointed because i wanted this to work. For started this producted dried my skin out and didnt clear up my blemishes. Second it took almost two weeks for my skin to go back to normal. now im stuck with a product that doesnt work.</li>
    <li> I used this product for at least 8 months.  My acne is mild-moderate, and mostly on my forehead.  I was always suffering with little bumps, blackheads and whiteheads trapped under the skin that would take forever to go away and sometimes erupt into cysts.  I wasn&#x27;t even sure when I bought the product if it would help the kind of acne I had, but I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.  It took several months before I saw a big improvement.  In the long run though, it just didn&#x27;t quite get me to where I wanted to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really think about trying a stronger product to see whether it would be more effective; it happened by accident because I was going on a trip and didn&#x27;t want to haul around the big 8 ounce tube of BP. So I got a small tube of Acnefree Terminator, the 5% strength.  I was a little afraid it would turn me red and flaky since Dan is always claiming that stronger products aren&#x27;t more effective, just more irritating.  However, when it comes to my skin, Dan was right about using BP but wrong about what strength to use.  Within a few days, my skin was glowing clear.  Clearer than it&#x27;s been for 12 years.  Too bad it&#x27;s going to be more expensive to keep it that way, using Acnefree instead of acne.org products.  But clear skin is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use an AHA as Dan suggests--but I use Aqua Glycolic toner instead of a lotion.  Again, Dan can be wrong sometimes--I am not fond of using lotions and my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to need them, other than a good sunblock during the day.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment and develop your own regimen!</li>

    <li> This bottle has lasted me over a year at this point, mostly because you only need a small amount to do the job. Any more than pea sized burned my skin and made it red (gave me a chemical burn). Everyone has different skin, but it&#x27;s a really good idea to spot test and see how yours reacts. A good rule is that if you can visibly see a layer on your face after you&#x27;ve let it set in and dry, you&#x27;re probably using too much. Other than that, it&#x27;s an effective treatment</li>
    <li> Acne entered my life when I was 11 years old. I have never found a product that is at least a little bit effective. I have tried products from 5 bucks to 60 bucks and none of them work. Although I am happy about the product, it might not work for you cuz every one is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My condition: I got continuous break out. So my face always looks like the following:&lt;br /&gt;30 non-inflamed bumps on each side of my cheek. There are 10ish pimples. Half of them look like larger inflamed bumps but they are actually inflamed. Around 5 of them are large, white, and really on the top and ready to naturally pop out. 10 bumps on the neck. 2-3 of them are inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro.&lt;br /&gt;1) Effective in killing P. acne bacteria. For non-inflammatory acne like little bumps, the product is awesome. I got around 30ish bumps on each side of my cheek. They were visible if I stare at myself 40cm-50cm (1.2ft-1.5ft i guess) from the mirror. After one week, all of them shrink. Most of them are only visible if I scrutinize myself within 15cm from the mirror (4inch-5inch i guess). And the overall amount reduces to 15ish really tiny bumps on each side of my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I think it also helps the healing process for the existing inflammatory acne. BP can never kill the existing pimples since they are already inflamed. But it helps my already-naturally-popped pimples turn in to dry scabs quicker than they usually do. Note I am talking about those wound that already closed. BP can never applied to an open wound. As soon as the scabs go away, my nice and new skin are perfect. The redness remain so that I still suffer from even tone but it is nicer to have acnes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Dryness. (This might not apply to you if your face is dry or sensitive.) Benzoyl peroxide is a anti-bacteria as well as a drying agent. This percentage of BP dries my faces a little bit to control the excess oil but not too drying to make the face producing extra oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It stops me from picking and popping my acne! The pain of apply BP on an open wound thwarts me away from popping my pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) It makes me wash my hands more frequently. (BP is a bleach agent...so it actually help me to improve my personal hygiene habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con.&lt;br /&gt;1) Not so effective on my neck. I can tell the bumps are smaller but not as impressive as the change on my face. The overall number of bump does not decline at all. (Maybe they are already inflamed so BP cannot help. Or maybe 2.5% is not enough for neck.) Let me wait for two more weeks and conclude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Itch! I have rough skins so I usually do not feel any pain. All the irritating OTC products are not irritating from my perspective. (I mean those Sal Aid 2%, Ratinoid, Alcohol products. I do not mean those chemical peeling products...) Good news is that the itch usually lasts about 5-10 minutes. It is still bearable. And I do not need a fan to calm down my face. Let me update later if I could build up a tolerance against itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The waiting time. Dan suggests 5-15 min waiting time which I think it is not completely correct. The waiting time is crucial but it is suffice if your face is dried and there is not excess water/product. In my case 2-3 min will be enough for the time between cleaning and putting BP. And 5-10 min is enough between BP and moisturizer. 15 min will over dry your face. For dry skin, this makes your skin less hydrated, speeding up the aging process. For oily skin, the over-dryness makes our cells produce extra oil, making a better environment for P.acne bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a good product. But every one is different. Good luck.popping my acne! The pain of apply BP on an open wound thwarts me away from popping my pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) It makes me wash my hands more frequently.

    <li> The Acne.org Treatment is the one product that finally helped stop our teenage daughter&#x27;s acne.  You must slowly work up to applying it to your face twice a day (morning and night). Start SLOWLY.... very small amount (pea size)all over the face once per day.  Then eventually ( after a few weeks) apply a nickle size once per day, etc. and eventually over time you will be able to apply it twice per day in the full amount.  Your face will get irritated initially -but adjust applied amount as needed and, if you give it time, your face eventually gets used to the Benzoyl Peroxide and will settle down.  It took about 4 months for our daughter to work up to the twice a day full amount and that is when her acne completely stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Here is her routine.  Morning: Gently wash face with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (Do NOT use wash cloth, only finger tips) - apply Acne.org Treatment all over face(NOT to eye area, though) - let try about 10 minutes - apply Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion.  Night:  Gently wash face with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (or Cerva Ve Foaming Facial Cleanser if you have make-up to remove) - apply Acne.org Treatment all over face (not in eye area) - wait 10 minutes for it to dry - apply Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;She also stopped eating all dairy products (milk, cheese, ice cream...everything dairy!)and started taking a multi-vitamin and an extra D3 vitamin.  I think the combination of these things plus the Acne.org Treatment completely stopped her acne.  She has had NO breakouts at all ( not even one pimple) for 3 months !</li>
    <li> Works better than tea tree oil, but it&#x27;s a bleach. I&#x27;ve ruined some towels and bleached a few spots on the carpet a bit despite trying to be careful. You have to wash your hands so hard after using this. If you forget even once, there goes a towel and what not.</li>
    <li> Tried a lot of different products and a lot of money for my son&#x27;s acne. He did his own research and found this product, tried it and it works great for him.  Thanx.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and it really took care of my acne. I don&#x27;t use it everyday anymore because it really dries out my skin if I do. My acne, except for spots and scars, is gone and I only break out during my period so that&#x27;s when I use it the most. Other than that, I use it maybe 3 or 4 times a week and only on the area that needs it instead of my entire face. This treatment really works but you need to get yourself a really good moisturizer. Also, the first two or so months (for me) sucked. My skin got dry and very itchy but the acne does go away</li>
    <li> Great price, beats it&#x27;s competitors. The product did exactly what it says it would do. Cleared up my face quickly. Fragrance free, which I love as well. I highly recommend this product. Daniel Kern knows what he&#x27;s doing. I look forward to trying more of his products. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with acne, not severe but noticeable. Most products did not work for me but then I found the Treatment. It worked pretty quickly and it is now rare for me to have a breakout (usually if I get lazy with my regimen). I have been using this product for a couple years and while my moisturizers or facial cleansers may change this is a constant. It lasts for awhile too, so you definitely get your moneys worth.</li>
    <li> I use no other brand but this one. It&#x27;s gentle and it W O R K S. I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my face pasty looking and it&#x27;s not overly drying, either. And I always wear some moisturizer over it, too. This is very important to do. :)</li>
    <li> Best 2.5% BP on the market.  I tried others but they didn&#x27;t seem as effective.  You can actually feel the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; as you let the product absorb in your skin.  I only have to use a little of the BP gel to cover all when following the steps of \\&quot;the regime\\&quot; and it spreads easily.  Compared to the BP creams I have tried in the past, this is much better and much cheaper!!! (The little tubes from the drugstore can really add up)</li>
    <li> This bottle lasts for quite some time (kept in the fridge of course) and is stopping enough to work without being too drying,</li>
    <li> My daughter had a lot of acne on her forehead and has been using this product for nearly 4 weeks alongside quinoderm facial wash. Previously she had had 8 months of oral antibiotics but her acne just seemed to get worse. She had also tried topical antibiotics and a UV lamp. The acne.org treatment has dramatically reduced the number of spots and has been the best treatment so far. There are some \\&quot;scars\\&quot; remaining but I am hoping these will fade soon and then I will be able to give the treatment 5 stars. I have also ordered the Regimen:Complete Acne.org treatment kit as I am so impressed with the results up to now. We are in the UK and I feel that, even with the shipping costs, the products are quite cost effective as packages are much larger than comparable products here.</li>
    <li> So I promised myself I&#x27;d stay consistent with this facial medicine for at least a full year before giving my review, I have successfully achieved this and am happy to say that this product really works. So, a little skin-history. I have always had really sensitive dry skin and have been getting pimples every day since I was 17, I am now 24. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of different acne medicines and methods and nothing has worked, and specifically &#x27;ProActive&#x27; actually made my acne worse. So, obviously I was a little skeptical but its so damn cheap that there really wasn&#x27;t an excuse not to try it, and I&#x27;m so thankful I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew the rules before starting this regimen and you should too, if you want to take this seriously and see results you need to follow them. Consistency, I cant stress this enough. When you first get the product, you will be red, you will be itchy, you might even break out, but you NEED to stay with it (unless you truly are getting an allergic reaction, lol). Your skin will be noticeably red in the beginning, it takes a few months for your skin to get used to the benzoyl peroxide, but this is something you must endure, it will pass. Be gentle when applying and never touch your damn face. Consistency, gentle, don&#x27;t touch your face. OK? Okay, cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 12th month on the product and felt that maybe, just maybe my skin didn&#x27;t need the medicine. Mind you I put BP on in the morning, took a shower about 7:00 PM and went out with some friends. The next morning I had a few new pimples and couldn&#x27;t help but laugh. Without this, I&#x27;m doomed and it really is laughable because the medicine clears a few pimples up considerably fast. It&#x27;s unfortunate that I might be using this my whole life, but it would be even more unfortunate living life without it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! 8 oz. lasts me a long time! I prefer this type of container over the bottle.</li>
    <li> I sure wished I had had this product when I was a teenager! Now, I am moving from middle-aged to aged, and aging ain&#x27;t fer sissies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Periodically, I get a really sore blemish on some part of my body, and if I can apply this product, it will soon disappear (sometimes within a couple of days).&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; as advertised but more like a watery paste that contains only 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide (active ingredient). Even with this small percentage the product seems to work pretty well. Apparently this small concentration prevents drying and damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When pricing around on the internet, this product seems to be the best bang for the buck. I keep it on my favorites list as the Missus likes it too!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  A little pricey though.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I have been using prescription acne medication since I was 14 (Epiduo) and now I am going to switch over to this for good. This is so much cheaper and works just as well if not better. I use this cream on my back after I have showered so my pours are open and can receive a good absorption of the medicine. I also use Nuetrogena body clear body was too in the shower and I honestly can say my back has never been so clear in 5 years. Don&#x27;t stop using this if you don&#x27;t see immediate results. Acne has to heal and it won&#x27;t happen overnight. After about 3 months of daily use my back is almost cleared completely. Stick with it and good luck!</li>
    <li> amazing.  onmy second bottle</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 months now and I am absolutely in love with this. If you follow the directions you will have a reduction in pimples. I am 34 and still break out, however with this treatment I have had the best outcome</li>
    <li> If you follow The Procedure on acne.org, you&#x27;re face will be cleared up. My face looks almost pre-pubescent now, and it&#x27;s only been a week!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I first purchased the 2 oz and after finishing the bottle I went ahead and bought this. It does burn my eyes a little even when I&#x27;m not applying it anywhere close to my eye area. Its not as drying as most BP products and by using the regimen I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement. I use cetaphil as my cleanser and a different moisturizer with spf but follow the principles of the routine outlined by acne.org. My acne didn&#x27;t completely disappear with this product, however I have hormonal issues which makes controlling my acne difficult. I will say this has by far been the most consistently effective product I&#x27;ve tried. Shipping is quick but a bit expensive I think. Overall though, this is a good value.</li>
    <li> Daniel Kern gave me a new face! two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;Read the Regimen and follow instructions as stated in the website ([...])&lt;br /&gt;Be very patient and I&#x27;ve got a brand new face in &amp;lt;2 months!</li>
    <li> I like the large size of this treatment.  Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t entirely work for my skin, but it does help.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re wondering whether this is worth the price, it&#x27;s lasted me 5 months so far, and it will probably last me another month or so.  I use it all over my face once a day.  Seems to work great.</li>
    <li> I always thought the stronger the BP the better.. Wrong!! This 2.5% is the best BP lotion around! Works wonders.. Don&#x27;t hesitate just get it!</li>
    <li> I used this stuff for years as it really did clear up my acne when I used it. I discontinued its use after about 2 years because my skin was becoming unbearably dry, even after putting on moisturizer. I&#x27;d get to work, smile, feel my face stretch, look in the mirror and see my skin looking all flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 years later since using it, my skin is still dry. I have to moisturize daily now because of this regimen. It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it&#x27;s annoying that I can&#x27;t go anywhere spontaneously unless I have moisturizer with me as my skin will feel tight after I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, your skin becomes VERY dependent upon benzoyl peroxide. Once you stop using it, your skin will absolutely freak out fro a while and look worse than it ever has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would never use again, and would never recommend anyone use a regimen that advises you to load up on this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from acne since I was 13 years old. Every time I thought it was improving for a little while, it would just seem to flair up with a vengeance. TRUST me when I say I&#x27;ve searched every single resource for a solution. I bought every single OTC product available that promised a cure. EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;Now, 6 months later I AM ACNE FREE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have waiting years to say that again!&lt;br /&gt;My advice to everyone is BE PATIENT AND STICK TO IT.&lt;br /&gt;you will get frustrated because you don&#x27;t see immediate results. Maybe not even until the third month. Mine took three months to kick in. And now I am happier than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I use:&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the whole entire acne.org system, but I do use what they tell us to use. If that makes sense. I have a fragrance-free, oil-free, cleanser. I use Purpose Cleanser. I use the instructions to wash my face that the website advices. Then I use THIS acne.org treatment (the holy grail of it all), and I moisturize with Cetaphyl Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Once again, I repeat, I follow the website&#x27;s instructions. (Thank You, DAN!!!)&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also I add a drop or two of jojoba oil to my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the acne.org AHA for my scars at night. It looks like its working too!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the products you can purchase straight out of acne.org do a better job, who knows. I use the most otc, and inexpensive products I can. They seem to be working great for me !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can now say my skin is acne free and almost completely even toned! I have never been so happy in my life and I am so happy to be writing this review. Thanks for reading. And Remember, stick to IT! Hope your journey goes great everyone!</li>
    <li> I was not blessed with perfect flawless skin, and it took a long time for me to find something that worked for my skin.  This treatment is what I have used over the past couple of years and it is the only thing that has ever given me good results.  Everyone has different skin with different needs and I&#x27;m glad I found what works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve always had mild acne problems. I&#x27;ll put this on morning and nighttime under my moisturizer and now I rarely get pimples. This saved my life!</li>
    <li> Works! Doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Easy to apply. Not too strong. And best of all the 8oz. is really big and lasts long even when you apply a lot.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out. The tube is huge, so you have plenty of product. That&#x27;s all I got for now.</li>
    <li> Ever since using it my acne has cleared up so much it&#x27;s unbelievable! My skin has been the clearest in over a decade. I would highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I developed terrible acne after I moved from Colorado to Florida. I felt like my once perfect skin decided to wage war against me in protest of the move. I literally tried everything to get my acne under control. Dermatologists, prescriptions, Proavtiv, Mary Kay, fancy department store brands, over the counter brands... you name it, I tried it. Nothing seemed to work. A family member told me about Acne.org and I decided to give the regimen a shot. I ordered the BP treatment on Amazon and started using it right away. My skin was really dry for the first month, but then it started to adjust, and my acne slowly started to dissipate. After three months, my skin is finally clear! I started using Acne.org&#x27;s AHA+ about a month ago in place of the lotion and I love it. It&#x27;s been really effective at helping to fade the scarring that the acne left behind. Both the Treatment and the AHA+ come in giant tubes, so it lasts a really long time. Worth every penny! I&#x27;m so glad I tried it out.</li>
    <li> If you use benzoyl peroxide then this is a great bulk purchase.  The tube is huge compared to the little ones you can buy in the stores and it&#x27;s just as effective.  Be careful with it because it will stain certain fabrics.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a little over a week and it seems to be helping somewhat, although my skin is dryer than ever and feels like sandpaper no matter how much moisturizer I use. But the real problem? I ordered this on a Thursday night, and by Friday afternoon my debit card information had been stolen (by someone in California, and what a coincidence that the seller is located in California...). BE CAREFUL, if you choose order this product watch your bank account closely!</li>
    <li> Benzoyl peroxide off the shelf in supermarkets and stores is generally quite expensive for the 2 ounces you receive. Acne.org provides the same product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Acne.org products are good.  I would check the org site before purchasing on Amazon to see if the org offers a better deal.</li>
    <li> My sister had problem with bad skin. This was the first and only product that actually helped! Thnak you Acne.org</li>
    <li> I got this product two days ago and can already notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;For one- the price! It&#x27;s $8 for .75 oz of 2.5% BP here in Hawaii. This is EIGHT ounces for $20! Amazing deal.&lt;br /&gt;Next- this is a gel. It goes on so smoothly, dries clear and never flakes like the BP cream. It even smells good!&lt;br /&gt;Last- It covers more area of the skin because of the gel formula. I can now use it twice a day in a lighter coverage method and my skin is clearing up wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you acne.org for your regime that has changed my life, and this amazing product. I swear I am not a shill, just a super happy customer sick of paying too much and seeing crappy results.</li>
    <li> this is a great product to reduce ur acnes, however, it dries out my skin so badly, after using this treatment, i have to use double amount of moisture product on my skin in order to heal the dryness.</li>
    <li> This is the only BP treatment that helps my combination skin. Not too harsh and it helps to dry out my oily skin. The only BP I&#x27;ll ever buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband has sworn by this product for years. I have never needed to use acne treatment until last year my face broke out with adult acne. This product helped to keep it under control without drying my skin out.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have had cystic acne for nine years and to be honest if I had not&lt;br /&gt;found ths product I still might have acne. I&#x27;ve tried everything out there but nothing worked right&lt;br /&gt;my face would never get clear. After a month on the treatment and I am clear no more breakouts&lt;br /&gt;for me. I did run out and had to buy a new one but while I was waiting for this product I was using a&lt;br /&gt;drugstore brand of benzoyl peroxide and I broke out like crazy, I finally got my second bottle of the treatment&lt;br /&gt;and they already started to go away and that was the next day. I dont use the whole system just the treatment&lt;br /&gt;but for a cleanser I use Neutrogena Power-Clear Scrub, Oil-Free Acne Stress Control it has Salicylic acid in it.&lt;br /&gt;These two combos keep me clear and happy. I would recommend this product to anyone with acne, even if you have the&lt;br /&gt;occasional pimple it works great as a spot treatment, I already got my mom and sister hooked on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything short of Accutane. Antibiotics, prescription creams, you name it. This worked very well for clearing up my acne along with keeping an eye on my diet. I only use this and a cleanser in the shower and I&#x27;ve noticed a big reduction in my cystic acne along with the smaller sores. Plus, with the large size I don&#x27;t skimp on application compared to the smaller tubes sold in stores. No irritation or redness due to the 2.5% concentration and the gel goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my skin but irritate and bleach my linens, shirts etc. I ended up switching to jojoba oil, tamanu oil and tea tree oil blend I mix myself and that has worked gentle clearing wonders on my skin naturally.</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions, it really works. The only problem is, after using it for a while, it started gradually bleaching some of my hair.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I ordered and arrived earlier than expected! Product is a little harsh and can stain sheets/towels if it comes in contact! Great seller - would recommend!</li>
    <li> ALWAYS FOLLOW THE TIPS. do exactly what the tips say ! don&#x27;t wait too long after using the treatment. otherwise your face will dry as hell. it works very well for me~ love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this as part of the acne.org regimen for 6 weeks and am amazed. I have tried many products along with 3 lots of antibiotics over the years, but am now finally on my way to having clear skin with this after such a short period of time. I only get the occasional spot now and old scars are fading (really helped by the AHA+ I think, which I have been using for a couple of weeks now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside was the extra charges as I had them delivered to the UK. Purchased this along with AHA+, both 8 oz. tubes and got charged around £16 customs charges. Annoying at the time but so worth it now!</li>
    <li> I began getting acne after having my first child at the age of 30 and it just got worse after my second child.  I tried SO many things including Retin A (which was a disaster), over the counter products, ProActiv, lots of natural products, and even tried cutting out dairy.  This is like a miracle in a bottle for me!  I rarely get a pimple, and when I do, it&#x27;s gone quickly, and is never giant and painful.  If you try this product, visit the Acne.org website for detailed instructions.  This stuff works and is actually a bargain for the amount that you get. It lasts me 4-5 months and I use it twice daily, as instructed.</li>
    <li> Rub it all over my face every morning and night. It has really helped my acne. I am not 100% clear but it has cleared up my acne a lot.</li>
    <li> If you need more than the occasional spot treatment, then for cryin out loud, don&#x27;t waste your money buying a .5 ounce, $5 tube of something at the drugstore. For those of us who need BP everyday, this is an economical way to use a generous amount. Bonus - the gel consistency smooths onto skin much better than creams and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on your face.</li>
    <li> I suffered from serious acne for over ten years (age 12-25). After a miscarriage, it got much worse very quickly and began experimenting with retin-a and clindamycin which only accelerated the problem. I had attempted to use Proactive in the past, but the BP level was way too high and made my face look and feel like I was experiencing chemical burns. Finally, after LITERALLY getting Daniel Kern on the phone while talking with customer service, he convinced me to throw out all of my prescriptions, quit the makeup routine I had for covering it all, and do a basic at home sulfur facial to pull out all of the irritants. I kept my face free of any chemicals for a week, then started the Regimen exactly as ordered. Within one month, I had intense results, and by four months I had flawless skin. Three years later, I still use the regimen everyday (yep, even when camping with the boys lol) I only wear a small amount of mineral makeup, and barely a dot of the products at a time. I have tried switching over to OTC BP/moisturizer that mimic this brand, but found they were simply not as effective. I have, however, started using a mix of the AHA, Jojoba and moisturizer, shaking them all together in a bottle to make sure my skin is extra moisturized now that I&#x27;m hitting 30. It works great, and I think in a year or so I might start weaning myself off the treatment to see if my skin can regulate itself finally. ANYways, as someone who suffered through the embarrassment and pain of acne for so long, I can tell you that if you use the regimen exactly as instructed without any outside Rxs or other intense makeups/chemicals, this product Does work and in my experience did Not &amp;#34;make it worse before it got better&amp;#34;. If you order this product and don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s working properly, or that you have irritation from the BP, call the service number and ask for some advice--DON&#x27;T GIVE UP, keep with it once you start and give your body a chance to fix itself. GOOD LUCK!!</li>
    <li> if you use this and Acne.org 16 oz. Cleanser everyday then your acne will be reduced significantly! really love it</li>
    <li> Cheapest over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide I&#x27;ve found.  It lasts forever!</li>
    <li> Really good product worked amazingly to clear my skin up but dried my skin out very badly my skin cracked and peeled off once that stage had passed I became oily again but my spots have completely cleared</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years, every night. It didn&#x27;t get rid of acne 100%, but my skin is significantly clearer than it used to be, as long as I use it regularly. I&#x27;ve tried some prescription stuff before, as well as Proactive, and I prefer Acne.org treatment. Especially considering the price, you can&#x27;t beat it .</li>
    <li> I have tried all many acne products so far. including drugstore and high ends ones. but nothing has worked for me so far. but this baby, is wonderful. It is my lifesaving. i have acne skin and break out from time to time. after starting to use this product, my skin hasn&#x27;t been so great. I have no acne at all! if i have a bump, i ll dab some over the acne and then it ll be gone the next morning. it is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day but sometimes it is a bit too dry so i don&#x27;t use it that day. Well, still it is better to have dry skin than a face full of angry red acne right?</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Buy it, you will love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the miracle cure for like 5 years, no joke. I became insecure about my skin since it masked my beauty. I did not believe the reviews since it seemed so good to be true. And I thought the price might be a bit too \\&quot;pricey\\&quot; but let me tell you. It&#x27;s worth every single penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally saw results after one day. I did not purchase the moisturizer/daily cleanser since I have the cetaphil daily cleanser and Dan says that works too since they are very similar. And then I use the cetaphil SPF moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimen: wash my face with the daily cleanser gently, wait for my face to dry, then I put on the BP \\&quot;treatment\\&quot;, and then I wait for that to dry, and then I put on the AHA+ which helps with scars and mini moisturizing. If my skin gets super dry then I will put on the cetaphil moisturizer. Then I repeat these steps whenever I feel a pimplo coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend this to anyone who is trying to get rid of their acne. Don&#x27;t doubt this product.</li>
    <li> I am 36 years old and have tried so many products trying to treat my moderate cystic acne. I visited the dermatologist many times with only limited results even with the consistent use of prescription products. Only when I started following \\&quot;the regimen\\&quot; to the letter did my acne finally subside. I saw improvements in the first week, but now after 4 months of continuous use, my acne is completely gone! It is important to really follow the directions and get through the initial redness and peeling, which will go away after a few weeks. I have actually saved money since I began \\&quot;the regimen\\&quot; since I no longer purchase any skincare products outside of the cleanser, treatment, moisturizer and jojoba oil. I highly recommend the Treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 27, 2013 Update- This product continues to work wonders. My skin is acne free. If I (stupidly) stop using the product for a few days a pimple will start to emerge, but as soon as I start using this again things fall back into place. Awesome acne cure.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the most effective acne product I have ever used. This product WORKS. I have been on Dan&#x27;s regimen successfully for almost 10 years (started back before he marketed his own products). Acne runs in my family. When I was younger I tried many over the counter products, before eventually visiting a dermatologist. I was prescribed Retin-A, Differin gel, birth control, oral antibiotics, and eventually Accutane. I used all of these things at separate times, properly, exactly as prescribed, and for a lengthy duration. The only thing that had any positive effect was Accutane, but it didn&#x27;t clear me completely, and came with some VERY nasty side effects. After that I tried various supplements, to no avail. This is the only regimen that has EVER cleared my skin, and it has kept it that way for nearly a decade (I&#x27;m 28 now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I infinitely prefer Dan&#x27;s product over comparable OTC products (such as Neutrogena On the Spot). It is unscented, absorbs better, and leaves no white residue when sweating or combined with moisturizer. It is also much more economical. I recommend the 8 oz. tubes over the 16 oz. hard dispenser, because as the product dwindles/ becomes hard to squeeze out you can cut open the tube with scissors and transfer the remainder into another container. Travel size jars work well for this. This will save a lot of the medication that would otherwise be wasted in the hard 16 oz. pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those of you just beginning the regimen, don&#x27;t be discouraged if you don&#x27;t get instant results. When I started, I noticed a very slight improvement in the first week, and then absolutely nothing for 3 months. However, I continued exactly as directed and at the end of that 3 month period my skin rapidly cleared, and has remained that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be patient, and stick to the program and you will have acne free skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The Acne.org Treatment is amazing.  I&#x27;ve used this consistently for the last two years and have gone from wearing concealer and heavy make up to cover my blemishes to simply a tinted moisturizer or nothing at all!  I will occasionally have a blemish, but only if I get lazy and skip the regimen that is described on the Acne.org website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that being said, if you want to see awesome results, you will have to follow the regimen!!!  Visit the Acne.org website and watch the videos.  I literally tried everything before this, (Clinique, Proactive, oil cleansing method, every drugstore product available) and nothing worked, but this.  There is an adjustment period in the beginning and it isn&#x27;t fun.  My skin was red and irritated for several weeks until I adjusted to the regimen.  The results are amazing though. I&#x27;ve had clear skin for two years.  Get the cleanser and moisturizer to go along with this treatment.  After my skin cleared up, I was able to switch to a less expensive drugstore cleanser and moisturizer that is similar to the cleanser and moisturizer sold with The Regimen.  I haven&#x27;t strayed from the Treatment though, it&#x27;s a great product and comes in a large size, so I don&#x27;t have to constantly reorder.</li>
    <li> Using this product along with Neutrogena sensitive skin oil-free lotion and Cetaphil bar soap has been the easiest and most effective acne treatment I have ever used. Great stuff and it is affordable because of how big of a bottle it is.</li>
    <li> The only topical treatment that works!</li>
    <li> Really mild BP that is gentle on your skin-- way better than storebrand BP products. Definitely try this! Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This  is my first time using Acne.org, and so far I am pretty pleased with it. It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and keeps the oil away.</li>
    <li> This product works as good as any other acne treatment out there, but for much cheaper. It does a great job of keeping skin clean without drying it out.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best BP gel I have ever used. The skin feel is sublime, it glides on. No residue, no clag, no gloop when applying moisturisers.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a 5% BP gel since I re-started the regimen two weeks ago, (again!!- got complacent and man did I pay the price) but this one from Dan Kern, even at 2.5% it is more than a match for the other one.&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used BP before, please do accept you may go very red, and seriously peel for the first 10 days or so. It is unavoidable. There will also be days when you can barely smile your skin is so tight, STICK IT OUT! After about five to seven days, your skin may look tight, wrinkled, like you&#x27;ve got a peeling mask on, lol. Do NOT quit here!! You have to keep going with the BP or your skin will start to breakout again AND it won&#x27;t shed the funky skin so fast. Hell it&#x27;s only a week or two, you want clear skin yeah? Then keep going!!! After 20 years of on off clearish skin with strong BP&#x27;s or horrendous acne due to no treatment at all, 2 weeks for me was no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;After 10 days of the 5% my skin was 90% clear but oh so dry. Tried the jojoba oil but it made no difference. Then the Dan Kern BP arrived and after only another few days (2 weeks on in total from starting) I have absolutely clear, smooth and translucent skin, barely any dryness, maybe a little on cheeks. And several compliments on my complexion! Woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;I can happily go without makeup because my skin is so clear.&lt;br /&gt;I have moderate to severe acne on face, back and chest, have done since I was about 13 (now mid-thirties!). Big sore blind spots, pustules, white heads, black heads, every pimple known to man with the beginnings of some cystic acne too. But not now thanks to Dan&#x27;s BP gel.&lt;br /&gt;A huge thumbs up also for the fact this gel is NOT tested on animals and does NOT contain any animal ingredients, result!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping to the UK only took 10 days! I was very happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;Love the packaging, one heck of a tube, should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;For those in the UK, a great moisturiser is Jason wild yam cream, once you are over the initial week / 10 days dryness. As my acne is hormonal anyway, this works great for me with Dan&#x27;s BP, it also contains a couple things that are also in Dan&#x27;s moisturiser, if you can&#x27;t get hold of that.&lt;br /&gt;For the severe dryness, the ONLY thing I found and thank the lord I did was Dr Organics Manuka Day Cream from Holland &amp; Barrett. It made it possible to hang on until Dan&#x27;s BP got here and still manage to smile without my skin cracking up! I tried E45, Allergenics, Weleda (all supposed to be very rich and moisturising but they didn&#x27;t even touch the dry skin). Some people recommend cetaphil but it is packed with ingredients I&#x27;d rather avoid.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy this acne org treatment gel. I used Panoxyl BP in the past (discontinued - thank goodness!) and it was evil stuff, it is why I was hesitant to start the regimen again. It peeled badly, burnt, stung and my skin didn&#x27;t just peel it crusted and cracked. But now I&#x27;ve tried the acne org BP there is no other for me ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Hope it gets you clear too. So nice to have confidence in how your skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m well into the last stages of my teenage years, and i have lived with acne on my face ever since puberty hit me at the of eleven. When i was eleven and the early stages of pubescent years are yet to unfold, i have been a faithful user of proactive. however, proactive did not progress well with my skin several years later. it would help diminish the appearances of my acne and allow my skin to be free from new acne for a span of three days, but i would always suffer from the cycle. although i did not have major acne problems, i did suffer from ones that were very painful and large in size every month. there would often be one on my four head or chin, and they would remain for a good week. when they do disappear, they would leave a scar and another one somewhere in my face will take their place. Anyway, when i was eighteen i began to notice that my acne slowed down in growth. i would only a receive a few here and there (most of them were still the painful ones). I decided to stop the use of Proactive since it was too much for me to pay and it wasn&#x27;t really a miracle worker. i also fell into believing that because i was getting older it was an impetus for my skin to slow acne production.  I switched to a drugstore product called AcneFree and clean and clear. big  mistake. it worked well for a while ( a month ), but after that i started getting tiny bumps on the corners of my chin, the chin area it self, forehead, temples, and my cheeks which was very uncommon for me due to the fact that i usually only break out around my T zone. I got very fearful and decided to stop using the products and return to proactive. however, as i did, my face began to break out even more. the lower cheeks suffered a lot from it. the painful bumps on my chin would come and go in fast intervals, one after the other. I was horrified and had to refrain from using make up to stop its irritation. Anyway, i saw a video of the Acne regimen on Youtube and did more research on the product. finally, with all the hope left in me, i decided to give it a try. I truly praise God for it, because i can honestly say that the product, especially this specific treatment, is a miracle worker. I gave it a shot and the results are truly a blessing. During the first two to three weeks of usage, i did experience dryness on my face.I have extremely oily face to begin with so the excessive dryness was very new to me. i did break out a bit more during the first week, but nothing major. I was aware that the first few stages will be tough, and they were. the dryness caused my skin to flake and a lot of pimples emerged in the first week. BUT after a good month later, my acne has completely disappeared. GONE. My cheeks have healed, i have not received any painful bumps ever since. my scars are also healing, and my face has become smoother in texture and tone. The dryness ceased! After the first three weeks three months ago, and i&#x27;ve only gotten three eligibly classified pimples. And they only stayed for a day or two. They did not come close to the bad ones i used to get. Great great product and an answer to my prayers!with all the hope left in me, i decided to give it a try.

    <li> I&#x27;m following The Regimen on Acne.org using this product, Clean and Clear Essentials Foaming Cleanser(Sensitive), and Oil of Olay Complete (sensitive). I&#x27;ve noticed my skin slowly improving over the last several weeks since I started. I do tend to pick at my face and the product is definitely more effective as long as I leave my face alone. Blackheads have decreased, and I get less deep cystic-type acne. The zits I do get clear up faster - dry up pretty quickly. The treatment definitely dries out my face if I do not moisturize adequately. I usually have oily skin but I had to start using a more creamy moisturizer at night to counteract the drying. This does not work immediately, but really seems to work over time if used as directed.</li>
    <li> quick  delivery. I love this product as it has cleared my acne. love it. if you have not tried it, i&#x27;d advice you to try it , you may be lucky as I am , before this I&#x27;d tried all kinds of products without success.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months and i can honestly say that it&#x27;s the only effective acne fighting treatment that i have ever use. The first week this product gave me so much flaky skin. I thought this wasn&#x27;t going to work but i told myself to be patient .. and guess what? by the third week of religiously following the steps, my acne was GONE! I am forever thankful that i found this product. It helped me with my confidence.. Thank you Daniel Kern for creating such an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I have been following the acne.org system for a while now and found it to be the only thing that works for me. I found this benzoyl peroxide to be a pretty similar to others I have used before with 2.5%. Not too irritating, not too sticky, and absorbs in the skin pretty easily and quickly depending how much you use. I decided to stick with it and once it started working for me and started buying the 16oz  because it is a better deal. But the real trick is just following Dan&#x27;s system and advice.</li>
    <li> the cap is broken when i got it.</li>
    <li> i had been using 5% bp couple years since u can&#x27;t get 2,5% from the stores in finland and now that i&#x27;ve finally got my hands on this product i couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, its so easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t make my skin that dry at all. Only thing i&#x27;m sorry about is that i hadn&#x27;t odrered this product earlier</li>
    <li> Excellent product. The best treatment that my daughter had ever used. Her skin is clear and she&#x27;s happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing, life changing product! I had horrible cystic acne a few years go and tried everything but this is the only treatment that has worked. It is a white opaque color and has the consistency of a gel and dries to a matte finish, making it very easy to layer under moisturizers or makeup. According to the regimen on acne.org you&#x27;re supposed to use an extremely generous amount which I would suggest if you currently have severe/cystic acne. However I currently have occasional acne so I just use a dime size amount to apply a thin film over my face at night and it keeps me pimple free except the occasional zit. Last year I stopped using this for 2 months because I thought I didn&#x27;t need it anymore and immediately after my face broke out into cystic acne again. This is a permanent part of my skin care routine now.</li>
    <li> Works great! A staple in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Best product! I continuously buy this to replenish.</li>
    <li> Really pleased to have been able to purchase this in the UK at a reasonable cost from Acne.org in the USA. I have been looking for a replacement to panoxyl 2.5% for ages and after having used this for 2-3 weeks I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Just like with EVERY acne product out there it works to a point. My skin isn&#x27;t perfect but it definitely helps, and better than many other benzoyl peroxide products I&#x27;ve used. You most often see 5% and 10% benzoyl peroxide products in the store and that is just too harsh for my skin on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a 8 oz. tube so it lasts a LONG time which is nice since it&#x27;s online only.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from the manufacturers website. I do not have servere acne, I am 24, and I&#x27;ve had laser done on my skin. It works but unfortunately the Cons outweigh the Pros. So, here&#x27;s why I deducted 3 stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This stuff bleaches everything!! No matter how long I rub it in or how long I wait before coming into contact with my clothes or bedsheets, it still bleaches everything!!&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve had to throw new sheets and pillow cases away because they revealed bleach spots later after applying the BP and going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve had to throw new and old shirts away because the neck region of the shirt becomes bleached inside and out after putting it on. I got two hoodies on my trip to the Netherlands and one of them is ruined on the sleeve region from me resting my face on my arm when the BP was applied and the neck region is ruined from the BP rubbing off onto the hoodie when putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;- My boyfriend has had to throw shirts away from the BP rubbing off my face onto his shirt when we hugged, when I rested my face on his shoulder, or any other time my face came into contact with fabrics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Its extremely drying. Using too little is ineffective and using too much is extremely drying. Having to put globs of BP on my face and following up with moisturizer just feels too heavy on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I love makeup and after having the laser surgery done applying foundation makes my skin look normal for once (I had pretty severe post acne scars from my teenage years). Unfortunately, I have to wake up almost an hour earlier than I usually would to wash my face, apply the BP, and wait a good half hour or longer before applying foundation. If I apply foundation too soon, the BP reacts with my makeup and makes my skin look like its peeling off. It also has the tendency to come off in globs if I applied foundation too soon. My skin looked miscolored in places where the BP made my makeup fall off and places where it remained intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned previously it works but it just depends on what YOU are willing to give up for clear skin. My acne personally is not bad enough to where buying new shirts and bedsheets every month is an option./&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned previously it works but it just depends on what YOU are willing to give up for clear skin. My acne personally is not bad enough to where buying new shirts and bedsheets every month is an option.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after doing lots of research on the internet and Youtube about acne skincare. I&#x27;m in my late twenties and have tried everything from dermatologists and topical treatments and the pill ! I do not suffer from severe cystic acne but have lots and lots of little under the skin bumps and some spots.  I&#x27;m only around 4 weeks in to this and have found it to be a little drying but not as severe as other topical treatments. I still only use it once a day which I found is enough to stop 98% of new breakouts. I put the rest of the breakouts down to weather and diet.&lt;br /&gt;Huge bottle for the price so a great product! If you&#x27;re even thinking about getting this you should!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now, and I&#x27;d say it works well 80% of the time.  It definitely has helped to reduce my acne.  Not 100% of the time, but enough so that I continue to use it.  It is BP, which means it can discolor your clothing if you&#x27;re not careful.  I do not follow the acne.org regimen exactly as they describe, and I still get great results.  Honestly I just don&#x27;t have the time.  But I put it on once/day, and my face definitely stays clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid discoloring clothing, try to use white towels, white pillow cases, and put it on your face when you know you won&#x27;t be changing clothes for a long time.  If you pull a shirt over your head while this is on your face, that can be enough to discolor it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no experienced much drying of the face with this, which is nice.  It does increase the shine a bit, but not to a level that makes me stop using it.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend, as long as you can be careful when you wear it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and it&#x27;s the only one I have used since I discovered it. The treatment is effective and in conjuction&lt;br /&gt;with the whole system it clears up my skin.</li>
    <li> So far I like it.  I received the item very swiftly since date of ordering and it is a great deal for the amount you get compared to drug stores and pharmacies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared for redness, irritation, and flaking.  Apparently it is something everyone experiences upon initial stages of treatment/use.  Definitely use a moisturizer with this as it helps tremendously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to wait for your face to dry after washing to apply BP and wait once more after before apply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO IT! Get started and begin your regime to a better life!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I use it twice a day and for the most part my skin has cleared up!  I get a pimple here and there and put this on as a spot treatment as well and within hours its gone!</li>
    <li> I like it very much. I have looked for killer product for long long time. Finally, my face is clear by using Acne.org products. I am from Hong Kong. the postage fee for the products (from US) is like 1/3 of the product price. But it is worth to buy!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product I have tried for acne! I have tried MULTIPLE products including Exposed Acne Treament, Proactive Acne System, and Clinique Acne Solutions, and none of them have worked as well as this product. I have been using it for about three weeks and my skin is smooth and clear! Some of my old acne scars have started to fade and the small bumps that were across my forehead are gone. I am so happy with this product! The only con I can think of is that it makes your skin really dry but using a good moisturizer will take care of that!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for only 10 days now but I can already tell its making a huge difference. My breakouts are only around the chin and jaw line and sometimes a few on the cheeks but this is a lifesaver. It hasn&#x27;t completely stopped the breakouts (still early) but its decreased them. If I do get one it isn&#x27;t nearly as big or inflamed as without the product and so far I haven&#x27;t gotten any cysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I only use the product 1x at night and may increase to 2x after another week or so. This is what happened as my skin adjusted: -First 2-3 days my face was slightly red (looked like a sunburn) and was very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;- I also felt a slight burning when I would put on moisturizer (even very gentle moisturizer- I love Paula&#x27;s Choice hydralight)&lt;br /&gt;- After this stage my face went through a peeling that lasted 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the first week my skin was finally normalizing and now (10 days) I would say its 90% adjusted and it no longer burns or peels.&lt;br /&gt;Really hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered this earlier when I was younger. Clear clear skin. Big big boost in confidence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews, but I&#x27;m the first to always research an item and read the reviews before purchasing anything online. So since many ppl have helped me w/their honest opinions, I feel I must do the same! I LOVE the acne.org bp treatment. I also purchased the cleanser which I LOVE as well. I am 46yrs old and have suffered with acne/cystic acne/oily skin on and off since I was 16yrs old. Befor trying the 2 acne.org products, I was using retin A, Aczone and solodyne (oral antibiotic) which are all prescriptions. I was washing my face w/Cetaphil and using CeraVe moisturizer. I stopped using all the prescriptions since starting the acne.org products and I see much better results than using the prescribed meds. I do continue to take the oral medication so that may help but the cleanser and bp by acne.org has cleared up my skin so much its unbelievable! I didn&#x27;t order the acne.org moisturizer but I purchased the jojoba oil which I add a drop or two to my moisturizer. I use the CeraVe at nite after I wash my face and use the bp treatment. During the day I use the Olay Complete all day moisture lotion SPF 15 after washing and bp treatment. My skin has never looked more clear! I would recommend this to anyone who has tried everything over-the-counter and all the prescription meds, you will be shocked at the results and be sure to follow the instructions on the acne.org website. Its only been a few weeks but I saw amazing results in a much shorter than than when using all that other crap. I should have tried these items a long time ago!!</li>
    <li> I know this works for some people, but it only made my acne worse. I used it for three weeks, back in 2011, and over that time, had an increasing breakout of cystic acne. Hard, swollen, HOT, painful nodules all over both cheeks. Red skin, itching, red, itchy eyes (even though I was being careful not to get it near my eyes). I&#x27;d used Benzoyl Peroxide for several years in the past, with good success, but concluded after using this product that I&#x27;d developed an allergy to BP, as these are classic symptoms of allergy to it. Only recently, have I mustered up the courage to try a different product with BP in it, and discovered that it wasn&#x27;t the BP, but the Acne.org product that had caused the problem... I could have saved myself almost 2 years of only partially successful pursuit of other methods of clearing my acne, including tretinoin, as well as a lot of emotional and physical pain, and scarring if I&#x27;d known that :(.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used proactive or any other big expensive acne care kit, but I&#x27;ve had acne since early high school and have tried a few different face washes, treatments, and supplements and so far this treatment is the best I&#x27;ve found. It can be drying so always use non-comedogenic moisturizer (acne.org has a list of ingredients shown to worsen acne) but it works and its not expensive, I order one of these bottles maybe every 5-6 months and I use it every night.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it before bed every night with hypoallergenic lotion. It keeps my skin not perfectly clear (nothing ever has), but a lot better than it would be without it. I had tried everything. Most products use salicylic acid which does nothing for me. This is the only acne treatment I have found (aside from tetracycline) that does the trick.</li>
    <li> I has a bad reaction from this product.  It simply was not a good fit for me and personally will not use again.</li>
    <li> Worked for me. I use a very thin layer, but I have sensitive skin. The instructions make it sound like you should cake on a thick layer, but that&#x27;s not necessary for me at least. Really cleared up my acne, or whatever it was I had for a year before trying this. I have noticed I would get a stye now and again (pimple on eyelid) which must be a result of using this (never had one before). I am very, very careful and put a bit of this on my eyelids as well now, and those went away. Probably not a good idea without a steady hand. When I forget to use the product for a week or more (work gets hectic) I notice my skin problems start to come back. Guess I&#x27;ll be using this product for a while! 8 oz. lasts me about a year, I use it every other day, or whenever I remember. I would be scared of using 10% solution at this point, 2.5% is plenty for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff cleared my acne. It does dry out your skin and I have the oiliest face on the planet. But after about a month of using it my skin went back to normal. I may have to use a different moisturizer because it causes fine lines on my face and im only 25 y/o.</li>
    <li> Never left a review before despite placing well over 100 orders from Amazon over the years. However I must review this product as it has had a HUGE impact on my life. Buy this if you are facing acne troubles. Forget Proactive, it is garbage and makes your acne much much worse over time! I couldn&#x27;t believe how bad it got after proactive (got it because of a few red bumps, but it causes hundreds of skin colored bumps - no thanks!). This product has made my skin perfectly smooth to the touch, and completely blemish free. The best part is once I start to get a slight red spot, I throw this on a little thicker in the region and it never becomes a full blown pimple. Awesome. If you are looking to be completely pimple free then here is my unique recipe. It worked magic for me: apply this product in the morning, and at night after washing your face. Take 2 pantothenic acid (500mg) capsules in the morning, at lunch, and at dinner (6 per day). I use the Swanson brand. This really works too, read about it on Google. In terms of face wash, \\&quot;Aveeno positively radiant\\&quot; is just awesome. I use that and wash off, then apply \\&quot;Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser\\&quot; (with the black label, the red label is garbage) and let that soak in while I wash the rest of my body (needs time to soak in and will start to tingle). After applying the acne.org cream, the aveeno clear complexion lotion works well. These 5 items have left my skin flawless and healthy, however I owe the most to this acne.org stuff. It is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now purchasing this product for the second time and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with how well it&#x27;s worked. I&#x27;m a 21 year old guy and have moderate acne, typically around my chin and cheeks and this stuff has helped immensely. I spread a small amount of this lotion over my face once a day in the morning. It&#x27;s effects are not immediate and I would not recommend this as a spot treatment, but after roughly a week of using it every day I definitely notice results. My acne becomes almost nonexistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would like to note about this stuff is that (although some people have said otherwise in these reviews) it has not bleached the collar of my shirts. I&#x27;ve used 10% lotion in the past and have found that it did, but with this stuff I&#x27;ve not seen that occur. Note that I don&#x27;t apply very much to my neck, but even so past products HAVE still bleached my collars. I have a light pillow case so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell if it&#x27;s bleached that, but if it has it&#x27;s very slight.</li>
    <li> OMG. Seriously people...I cannot rate this high enough.&lt;br /&gt;After having my daughter I suddenly got the worst adult acne known to man kind. HUGE cystic and painful bumps on my jawline (of whom I would affectionately name since they stuck with me for so long), embarassing scars...ugghhh. How frustrating. I must have spent thousands of dollars over the past 5 years trying prescriptions, ProActiv, natural solutions everything under the flippin&#x27; sun until one day I stumbled upon Acne.org.&lt;br /&gt;Basically he tells you all the stuff you already know...but if you are like me you are finally ready to try anything and follow any regimen as long as it works. And holy moly does it work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing the regimen for almost a year now and I cannot believe the difference in my skin. I started out just using drugstore products, but decided that the Acne.org products not only gave me MORE of what I needed, I would also be financially supporting the person who saved my face....and my sanity.&lt;br /&gt;Do each step EXACTLY has he says...no if&#x27;s and&#x27;s or butt&#x27;s...and be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;If your face starts to get a little dry or peel...just back off on how much of the treatment gel you are using and MOSITURIZE!!!</li>
    <li> Huge value for the price.  Best acne product if you want or need to use a moisturizer or sunscreen after.  A lot of acne treatments will cake up if you use a moisturizer or sunscreen after.  Not this one.  It is a thinner consistency.  Allow it to fully dry before applying moisturizer and no issues.</li>
    <li> this is heaven in a tube. i&#x27;m surprised to see how many people have had bad experiences with this product. for me it is absolute magic!!! clears breakouts so fast. PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO MOISTURIZE AFTER YOU PUT THIS ON YOUR FACE!!!! I&#x27;m talking like extreme moisture. After this dries on my face, i use 2 pumps of cetaphil lotion and just let it soak into my face. this product does make your skin peel the first few days but once you apply the moisturizer all of that goes away and healthy beautiful skin is revealed. highly suggest this product if you have a good moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> So impressed with the product. It was recommended by a friend, as I have had skin problems throughout my late teens. It has worked better than any others and I now swear by it.</li>
    <li> Very good. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am happy to report that in just a few days, a very bad acne breakout that I have been fighting for like a year on my forehead and nothing was working finally is just about clear.  For months I had like 10 pimples in various stages of healing at any given time and just when some would start to clear up, new ones were always popping up.  I just thought I couldn&#x27;t win and that it was time to accept that I have adult acne and that I should just start getting used to it. Well, in just the past few days that I started this, no new acne has developed, the 5 that were about to pop did and then didn&#x27;t come back, and the two deep cystic ones are going down.  Once these two cystic ones are gone, I will finally be clear for once in such a long time!!! What I like about this is that it hasn&#x27;t dried me out or irritated my skin, the texture is very nice and light and absorbs quickly, and interestingly enough, has not contributed to hyperpigmentation.  Every other BP product I have tried just wasn&#x27;t worth it because of the hyperpigmentation, but this product my acne has been healing quite nice!  I hope the good progress continues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I think the advice in \\&quot;The Regimen\\&quot; makes a big difference too.  Being uber gentle with your skin, who knew that was key to the cure?  Everyone else always wants to scrub or peel your face off and do extractions...I&#x27;m so glad that this has made such a difference!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later:&lt;br /&gt;My skin is completely clear! I now need to deal with the acne scars but at least now I don&#x27;t have inflamed pustules, cystic acne, and popped pimples in various stages of healing all over my forehead.  Amazing stuff!  I did have a few days of excessive dryness and then a day of thick dry plaque dryness when started to become a little overzealous with use, so I reduced the dosage for two days and then gently exfoliated the dry skin off and voila! Nice clear skin and no more pimples!  Don&#x27;t skimp on the moisturizer while using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and invest in a pack of 14 white face towels.  Add them to your cart now! Use a fresh and clean towel with each wash, and just do laundry once per week.  I also think this contributed to my skin clearing up.  Always use a clean towel./&gt;Oh, and invest in a pack of 14 white face towels.  Add them to your cart now! Use a fresh and clean towel with each wash, and just do laundry once per week.  I also think this contributed to my skin clearing up.  Always use a clean towel.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for eight years and refuse to be without it. After my skin adjusted (about two weeks), my skin cleared up and has stayed clear as long as I use it. I wash with baby body wash (world&#x27;s most sensitive skin) and then a thick layer every night. It&#x27;s my holy grail acne product and I hope they never change it.</li>
    <li> So, I have to say, I love On-The-Spot and that stuff works great. It&#x27;s however very expensive, and is definitely a spot treatment unless you want to break the bank trying to use it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good alternative since it&#x27;s cost/ounce is much better. I can use this on my entire face (rather than treating problems after they pop up) and it has done wonders. The 2.5% Benzyl Peroxide does a great job of pre-treating for any breakouts and does not irritate sensitive skin like some of the 10% brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side note though is that since I&#x27;ve started using this, I&#x27;ve been treating the underside of my face and this resulted in some irritation and breaking out since that area was not used to getting any treatment prior. If this area is sensitive for you, I recommend only treating it if you plan to for the long haul. Otherwise, stay away from that area as acne there can take a while to heal and fade.</li>
    <li> The amount of BP you get in this product is amazing! (If you don&#x27;t know oz. it&#x27;s worth converting so you know what I mean!) The treatment is smooth &amp; extremely easy to apply, no &amp;#34;bittyness&amp;#34; or whiteness. I find it dries fairly rapidly (never more than 10 minutes) even when using a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will NOT turn white when you sweat unlike BP creams, big plus! I&#x27;ve only been using it for 1 month so have yet to see it&#x27;s full effect but have used BP very successful before so have high expectations &amp; everything so far is looking good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fast delivery, helpful instructions, really good value for money &amp; overall great service.</li>
    <li> I use this BP on my back and chest. It actually ABSORBS unlike the BP you find at the store. It will leave absolutely NO white residue. This 8oz bottle actually lasts me a really long time. Its like an endless bottle. This treatment has cleared up my body acny almost completely with just a few spots here and there. The reason I did not give this 5 stars is becuase, although most people use this for their face, I have a lot of little blackheads and whiteheads on my face that are not very noticible but when I used this product it broke me out pretty bad. I think it was getting all that junk out of my skin but I panicked and stopped using it. I would rather deal with the relatively un noticeable spots than a full on breakout for who knows how long. So if you have a lot of small under the skin stuff like I do and want to get rid of it using BP...just be prepared.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll just admit straight up that I hate smearing my face with this stuff twice a day, but it is sadly the only thing that has helped my acne, and I think I&#x27;ve tried just about everything.  I don&#x27;t follow the rest of the Acne.org regimen and I don&#x27;t use this BP gel the way Acne.org recommends because a pea sized amount has consistently worked well for me.  I mainly started buying this because I prefer 2.5% and I was getting tired of constantly buying the teeny tiny tubes of Neutrogena 2.5% BP cream.  I&#x27;m really happy that I switched to this treatment because not only does it save me a ton of money to buy one big tube that lasts for months, but the gel just feels a lot nicer going on absorbs without leaving a weird residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 simply because benzoyl peroxide is a bummer even if it has cleared up my acne. It is drying, bleaches your pillow cases and the collars of your favorite shirts, and it increases sun sensitivity. Even after slathering my face with moisturizer it sometimes stills feel tight and dry and itchy.  If you have moderate to severe acne it is totally worth it though, but for mild acne I&#x27;d start with something much more gentle.</li>
    <li> Best quality, best price benzoyl peroxide you&#x27;ll find anywhere by far. I&#x27;ve searched all over online, in stores - no one offers BP in large quantities like this and at this price. Anywhere else is at least double the price. Every store sells in small 1 oz or .5 oz tubes which is simply not enough for using on face, chest, back. Can&#x27;t beat this. Great packaging, I trust the brand, good website, too.</li>
    <li> The product is so much better than store bought benzoyl peroxide. Light and creamy. Does not dry and peel off and so gentle on the skin. Not harsh like others. I have used this product for many many years before they were on amazon. 5 star for sure.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Was very hopeful because of all the positive reviews and used the whole system for about 5-6 months and saw no improvement at all, if anything it got a little worse, still searching for good skin!</li>
    <li> Second one! It works so well I&#x27;m in my second month and I hardly breakout anymore. My acne is gone! 100% acne free! Thank you Dan! Start now it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> Great product great price fast delivery to the UK many thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommend for anyone battling with their skin. Item is always quickly dispatched. Never disappointed.</li>
    <li> Have been ordering the acne.org benzoyl peroxide treatment for several years and it works wonderfully when I stick with my version of the regimen (I use Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser instead of acne.org&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin on my face with moderate acne; I have a hard time keeping my face from drying out even without cleansers, so I&#x27;ve always been concerned with strong acne treatments.  Every other treatment I&#x27;ve tried for sensitive skin wasn&#x27;t strong enough to stem my acne, and anything stronger would completely dry out my face.  The acne.org cleanser alone didn&#x27;t get my acne where I wanted so I tried out the treatment.  This is the only treatment that clears my skin without overly drying it out!  I was so excited when I started seeing results!  I had to start out with the every-other day routine, but I now use it every night.  I have to use lots of moisturizer to prevent dry skin, but my skin is clearer than it has ever been!  I still get the occasional acne, but not bad at all and it takes much less time to go away with the treatment.  I am so thankful to Dan for creating and sharing this treatment!  I definitely recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different acne products, and none of them have worked. I purchased this item due to great reviews and got it few days ago. I&#x27;m on my day 4, my acne has improved drastically and it seems to be fading away. Despite some minute redness, this product is surely the best out there. I have acne on my chin and mostly on my cheeks. I&#x27;d say after 4 days, I my acne is 50% gone and a whole lot unnoticeable.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of a kind product. It definitely gets rid of acne if you use it persistently and it will clear up your face! and the bottle is nice and big so it lasts for a while! love this stuff! would recommend it to everyone! great purchase.</li>
    <li> I grew up without an allergy from anything. I followed the procedures carefully with how to use this product. I would normally have 1 or 2 big pimples whenever I would have my periods but this past months I&#x27;ve had more and more on my face that I opted using this product. After 2-3 hours of washing my face, I had a severe allergy from it. I thought it was something I ate but everytime I would use this even with a really tiny amount, severe allergy appears..my face is itchy, red, swollen all over!!! And whats worse is that it lasts for 3-5 days!  And my doctor said that this product might have even triggered some food allergies on me. :( Too bad I bought a big one :( and that it&#x27;s a waste of money since it was really  pricey :(</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I have to for this product. Recently, I experienced the dreaded adult acne stage. I was horrified at how terrible my skin had become; most of the breakouts were around my cheek area which led to awful scaring. I tried a lot of different natural products, but nothing worked. I finally gave up and tried Nuetrogena&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide. It helped some, but not much and it was too expensive to keep buying (4oz bottle for $8...no thanks). Also, the cream version was hard to spread  During that time, I came across Acne.org&#x27;s site, but was skeptical. Finally caved and ordered the treatment and AHA. The gel version is much better than cream because it spreads better. I use the benzoyl and AHA religiously. Didn&#x27;t see the need to buy moisturizer and cleanser though.  Follow the instructions on the site...he has great tips!</li>
    <li> Significantly reduced my breakouts. Although i still get some. Decent for the price. I like it. I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> We bought this product because they don&#x27;t make you sign up for monthly automatic shipments (like you-know-who&#x27;s infomercial product).  Check out their website, tons of great info, especially the video how to use these or any product for treating acne.</li>
    <li> Give it time and it will work. I had mild acne and it still took 3 months to completely clear. Also I only apply it at night followed by cediphil lotion. Day time I use aveeno clear skin face lotion. Night and day I use cetiphil face wash.</li>
    <li> I love the size of the bottle and it has been working great for me. It is no miracle worker, of course, course, but it really helps just before my period when my face breaks out really badly. I think finding a better cleanser or moisturizer might help make my skin even more clear but so far I&#x27;m really happy with this product. The only bad thing I have so day about it is that it can leave my skin a bit dry and I&#x27;ll have random days where it will be more irritated and sensitive than usual. Also, after a couple of days it seems to cake itself on my face and I&#x27;ll have to scrub my face somewhat roughly to get it feel normal again. However, that might be more of an issue with my cleanser rather than the bp.</li>
    <li> This really helps out with my sever acne! Love how it sinks in to the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oil feel</li>
    <li> This is a very good deal.  The gel version of this is lovely to work with and I certainly won&#x27;t run out any time soon.</li>
</ol>
