### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>best part</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good for hallween ~</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be fair</li>
      <li>I bought this for a cosplay costume (comic convention) and it was great.  </li>
      <li>It washes out easily, but the nice thing is how well it stayed in my hair all day while in costume- even with a hat over it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying one more vinegar rinse and calling my hairdresser.</li>
      <li>but I did think it would do a better job.</li>
      <li>I use it just like hair spray and love it.</li>
      <li>its like more of a paint..</li>
      <li>One can did the job fine.  </li>
      <li>My hair is a light auburn and I bought this product for dress-up for an event with kids.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Color held all day and washed clean out with no issues.</li>
      <li>it is super cheap, drips all over the place and looks nothing like this chicks hair in the picture.</li>
      <li>After opening it up, the first can seemed to be cheap aerosol, the spray dribbling out in some clumps.  </li>
      <li>Fun to use for parties.  </li>
      <li>It was a dark grey at best.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve colored my hair all sorts of wacky colors before (silver, green, etc.) and have never been more disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(okay, maybe just five different kinds</li>
      <li>In retrospect, it would have worked out better for me to buy two white hair extensions.  </li>
      <li>And it came out fine with shampoo the next morning when I took a shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i really thought thought it was like how it looks on the picture</li>
      <li>I bought this for cosplay and found it works really well.</li>
      <li>this spray i really dont recommend..</li>
      <li>It looks absolutely nothing like the image.</li>
      <li>Used the whole can</li>
      <li>The wig I purchased was fabulous but needed two white streaks.  </li>
      <li>But once I just started spraying directly on my face this worked fine, and lasted for several hours.  </li>
      <li>this comes out grey not white, no matter how many coats you put on.</li>
      <li>The first can was used up and there was barely any color change.  </li>
      <li>I tried combing this through my beard after applying it, but that pretty much just took all the color off of my beard and left it on the comb, which ruined the comb.  </li>
      <li>Wish I would&#x27;ve read the reviews--my son has dark blonde/very light brown hair.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t even grey, really, just a really old-looking auburn.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and non messy.  </li>
      <li>since that time went to a hair dye a natural brown</li>
      <li>The temporary white hair spray worked very well as fara as color and coverage.  </li>
      <li>Would like to order some other colors for fun</li>
      <li>It is hard to apply evenly and is too easy to get on your skin.  </li>
      <li>n dry very ugly&lt;</li>
      <li>Upon using the second can, some color did manage to come out, but it was nowhere near the color in the picture for the product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wish I would&#x27;ve read the reviews--my son has dark blonde/very light brown hair. DID NOT turn his hair one iota white! Felt more like I was spraying canned air on his head--was very, very cold! We ended up putting baby powder on his head.</li>
    <li> This really stripped my hair since using this for Halloween my hair has been dry and dull like the white is still stuck to my hair I washed it every day its probably just not good for your hair might as well have just put spray paint in my hair</li>
    <li> I bought this for a cosplay costume (comic convention) and it was great.  It washes out easily, but the nice thing is how well it stayed in my hair all day while in costume- even with a hat over it!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for anyone who needs to temporarily color their hair for a costume party or convention without fear of it staying in after you wash it out.</li>
    <li> LEAVES HAIR STICKY/STIFF</li>
    <li> I would like to amend a review I posted previously. The item arrived today - so it&#x27;s on time after all!</li>
    <li> My hair is a light auburn and I bought this product for dress-up for an event with kids. TWO cans later, my hair wasn&#x27;t remotely white. It wasn&#x27;t even grey, really, just a really old-looking auburn. It stunk terribly and made my hair feel like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part (and I&#x27;m being facetious here), four days later and a million different kinds of shampoo later (okay, maybe just five different kinds but you get the point), it hasn&#x27;t washed out. It&#x27;s still streaked a faded white here and there. I&#x27;m trying one more vinegar rinse and calling my hairdresser. I didn&#x27;t expect it to come out in one wash but seriously, this is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I get that this wasn&#x27;t supposed to turn my hair completely white (despite the picture) but I did think it would do a better job. I&#x27;ve colored my hair all sorts of wacky colors before (silver, green, etc.) and have never been more disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would never, ever buy again.</li>
    <li> Be warned if you have brown hair this comes out grey not white, no matter how many coats you put on.</li>
    <li> I bought this for cosplay and found it works really well. I had no problems after it dried. I really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I use it just like hair spray and love it. It turns my silver hair white, even the hair that is darker. It&#x27;s expensive to use as a hair spray, as the can is small. But it works for me, so I&#x27;ll buy it.</li>
    <li> Shook the can a lot but this still beaded up on hair and was wet.  Very disappointing.  Would not trust this brand again.  The color was not white but just gray and like I said already, WET!  It didn&#x27;t make a difference how close or far the can was held from the surface to be sprayed---it still beaded up and was very wet.  I went as Lilly Munster to a costume party.  The wig I purchased was fabulous but needed two white streaks.  In retrospect, it would have worked out better for me to buy two white hair extensions.  Now I have the problem of removing this crap from an otherwise nice costume wig.</li>
    <li> I got 2 cans based on review here to color my red/brown beard white for a costume.  One can did the job fine.  I tried combing this through my beard after applying it, but that pretty much just took all the color off of my beard and left it on the comb, which ruined the comb.  But once I just started spraying directly on my face this worked fine, and lasted for several hours.  And it came out fine with shampoo the next morning when I took a shower.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Bought this to spray my little girls hair white for halloween. Used the whole can and you could not even tell it was sprayed.</li>
    <li> The temporary white hair spray worked very well as fara as color and coverage.  It makes the hair stiff and difficult to comb or style however.  Any spray would probably do that though.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for hallween ~</li>
    <li> Worked well. Toxic smelling during application, but it is hair spray.  Color held all day and washed clean out with no issues.</li>
    <li> would reorder this spray if i have too. was using it on my hair daily to thicken up my thin grey hair! would reorder and have. since that time went to a hair dye a natural brown but if i ever go back to grey i will reorder them!</li>
    <li> DOES NOT SHOW ON BLONDE HAIR!!</li>
    <li> It is hard to apply evenly and is too easy to get on your skin.  It is sticky so that you can&#x27;t brush your hair after using.  It is not really a bright white.  Santa Claus was not happy.</li>
    <li> this spray i really dont recommend..its like more of a paint..very thick n dry very ugly&lt;br /&gt;i really thought thought it was like how it looks on the picture</li>
    <li> After buying 2 cans for a costume, the product had arrived, and so did the day of the convention.  After opening it up, the first can seemed to be cheap aerosol, the spray dribbling out in some clumps.  The first can was used up and there was barely any color change.  Upon using the second can, some color did manage to come out, but it was nowhere near the color in the picture for the product.  It was a dark grey at best.  I still went about the con, but I felt a bit cheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thought: Do not purchase this product if you&#x27;re looking for white.  It looks absolutely nothing like the image.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on dark hair</li>
    <li> it is super cheap, drips all over the place and looks nothing like this chicks hair in the picture. it is clearly photoshopped because in this can lies a weak liquid that i presume you would have to utilize the entire can do color even a segment of your hair white. i just looks gross, wet and grayish. don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> Fun to use for parties.  Easy to use and non messy.  Would like to order some other colors for fun</li>
