<li> but it makes my hair feel shiny and soft and not greasy or waxy/stiff like some other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> My flat iron glides through my hair and my style stays all day.</li>
<li> Highly recommend this product and you only need a small amount</li>
<li> Flat Marvel Straightening Balm does the job!  </li>
<li> and I always have a hard time getting my hair straight .</li>
<li> use this in combination with the Keratin Complex Straight Day Hair Spray.</li>
<li> Product was destroyed package was a complete mess , stuff was everywhere!</li>
<li> I attempted various other products until I found this one and would not settle for anything else ever again.</li>
<li> It made my hair like dry straw.  </li>
<li> Sometimes, I air dry</li>
<li> I used it after I dry my hair, before I use the straightening iron.</li>
<li> The is a product I CAN NOT live without.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> If you have thick coarse curly hair and need something to help w/ the unruliness, this is for you</li>
<li> It works well to tone down the frizz and waves after washing my hair.</li>
<li> It does straighten my hair and makes it look healthier and less frizzy.</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s too thick or heavy like some similar products.</li>
<li> Got a bottle of this a few years ago upon suggestion from my stylist.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like there&#x27;s a product in it.</li>

    <li> This makes my coarse, wavy hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying this product and I LOVE it! Works great on my naturally curly hair. I use this and KMS FreeShape Quick Blow Dry together and what used to take 15 mins to blow out my hair now takes 7 mins. My hair is not weighed down and is very shiny and soft. I am very selective about hair products and have tried so many straightening products. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> This product mells wonderful!  Doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel greasy.  Makes straightening so much quicker and easier. I love it.</li>
    <li> Helps to control frizz</li>
    <li> This is the best.  My husband and  I both use it !  It has been an important part of our haircare for years!</li>
    <li> My daughter and i love the flat marvel. It makes blow drying quicker and helps keeps hair straight longer. Great product.</li>
    <li> After trying endless products throughout the years, I can say with complete certainty that this one is truly the best. It makes my hair shiny and healthy, gets out the waves, protects against the heat damage of the blow-dryer and styling iron as well as against humidity. It is very light-weight, has pleasant fragrance and, on a side note, helps the hair stay fresh and clean longer during the day. Amazing!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a salon pro, so I searched for it on Amazon. It arrived quickly and has been the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my flyaway, super-curly hair, even in Florida.  I will keep it in my cupboard in good supply. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Product was destroyed package was a complete mess , stuff was everywhere!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does straighten my hair and makes it look healthier and less frizzy. I used it after I dry my hair, before I use the straightening iron. It&#x27;s been part of my routine for a couple of years now.</li>
    <li> Loved this. Just have to be careful not to use too much or it gets greasy fast.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Cheaper than getting from the salon and works everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination with the Keratin Complex Straight Day Hair Spray.</li>
    <li> No so good because it does not hold the hair in place.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair extra straightening boost, I use just before flat iron, in addition to Elixir - good combo</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair, that I like to straighten from time to time.  A little bit of this helps my hair blow dry smooth w/o frizz.  Sometimes, I air dry and it reduces frizz a lot.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Always keep some on hand and use it to travel where humidity is an issue!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I have to use a ton of it (around 4-5 pumps... lots of coarse, wavy hair to straighten), but it makes my hair feel shiny and soft and not greasy or waxy/stiff like some other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, the only con is the price: I go through a bottle of this every 2 weeks, so it gets expensive. Totally worth the expense in my book.</li>
    <li> Flat Marvel Straightening Balm does the job!  It makes my hair smooth, glossy, and protects it against heat damage.  It also has a great fragrance that is not overbearing.</li>
    <li> The is a product I CAN NOT live without. I have very thick hair that take forever to dry and then on top of that it is an ackward wavy. With this my hair dries on like 5 minutes with a hair dryer and I hardly have to use a straightner afterwards. My sister just has thick hair and when she uses it she does not even have to use the starlightner. Totally worth the buy!</li>
    <li> my hairdresser used this and i am wowed. awed. exceptionally light feel - not \\&quot;producty\\&quot; feeling at all. doesn&#x27;t add weight. i have thick, curly hair and this straightened it but left it shiny, very movable, and straight until the next wash. i couldn&#x27;t wait to order it.</li>
    <li> It works well to tone down the frizz and waves after washing my hair.</li>
    <li> I have curly thick hair, and I thought from the reviews that I had read, this would be a miracle worker.  It made my hair like dry straw.  Wished it had worked.</li>
    <li> I received a small tube of the Goldwell Flat Marvel Straightening balm for Christmas and after the first use I ordered a big bottle online. Works great for Thin/fine hair. Highly recommend this product and you only need a small amount so it last a while</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. I have curly hair I straighten and use it before the straightening iron and it helps smooth it out.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair. Love this!!!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products of all time. Makes blowouts easier and quicker and seems to really smooth my hair.</li>
    <li> Best product in the world for sleek hair!</li>
    <li> I tried this because I saw a video on utube about Goldwell products.  It kind of made my hair a bit flat but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  The only thing I did not like was the scent.  It was very pungent to me.  I wanted to try the jelly boost.  I guess maybe some time I&#x27;ll try that.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely worth the price.  Only a small amount is needed to get great results and it allows one to extend the time between haircuts!  I attempted various other products until I found this one and would not settle for anything else ever again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, the product leave my hair feel a little crunchy and doesn&#x27;t really give it a smooth and glossy effect.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It&#x27;s not sticky, greasy, or oily and leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all. My hair was still kinda curly. All it did was take some frizz out. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> this straightening balm is very good and very reasonable in price. You could buy something from the drug store, but I like the professional quality of Goldwell products. If you have thick coarse curly hair and need something to help w/ the unruliness, this is for you</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best! Works great and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. This is my second bottle and I wonder how I ever flat ironed my hair without it</li>
    <li> Love this product. It really helps tame the frizz and enhance shine. And it&#x27;s too thick or heavy like some similar products.</li>
    <li> Got a bottle of this a few years ago upon suggestion from my stylist. It&#x27;s great. Makes my hair feel awesome. If I&#x27;m in a rush, I just put some in my hands after my shower and run it through my hair, controls frizz really well. If I have time to style, curl or straighten, this product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed too!</li>
    <li> The best straightening product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> My son has straight hair that is starting to get wavy as he gets older.  This works well to keep the waves in line.</li>
    <li> I use this product exclusively on my bangs to protect them from my straightener. It&#x27;s great! My hair stays straight longer (even in humidity) and is always shiny and lovely after I use it.</li>
    <li> Its a very good hair styling product. I stumble upon it and glad I bought it. Makes your hair very smooth.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product as a sample. Once I tried it, I knew it had to be staple in my hair routine. Smells great. Works great!</li>
    <li> I like it. It smells good. But I really don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair. It could just be I&#x27;m doing something wrong or I have a bad flat iron. I have thick wavy shoulder length hair and I always have a hard time getting my hair straight .</li>
    <li> Goldwell straightening lotion is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used on my hair. My flat iron glides through my hair and my style stays all day. It isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like there&#x27;s a product in it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, use it all the time, Definitely recommend, easy to use and works great, would hate to be without it!</li>
    <li> Not to crunchy, hard, or shiny. This product leaves your hair looking natural and very pliable.</li>
