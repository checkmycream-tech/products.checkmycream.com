<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product just as advertised and works great. Still using the first blade since I received the sharpener/cleaner.  Even in the middle of a shave sometimes a corner of the blade seems bent and I can feel it.  A few seconds using the &#x27;Razor Saver&amp;#34; and the blade is back to being new again, amazing.  You will not need an expensive one.  This little product works great!  And yes, it was shipped promptly and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Not seeing it made any difference.</li>
    <li> A good way to save money on disposable razors.  Just wish the instructions were more clear.  This is also easy to clean, which is convenient.</li>
    <li> The small price was worth trying this product. It arrived in just a few days and was as described. Seems to be keeping my sharp blades sharp as it states to use before razor gets dull. I was not happy with the shipping and handling charge which was more than half the cost of the product. Overall I am glad I made the purchase. One last thing, the opening for the razor handle is narrow and some razors with big handles may have trouble moving back and forth in the slot.</li>
    <li> The Razor Saver is an inexpensive, innovative product that has helped prolong the life of my (very expensive) commercial razors. Not only do I get more use and value from my razors, I enjoy each shave more (the last few aren&#x27;t unbearable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the company has a great mission and sustainable practices, plus their customer service is 5-star. Steve reached out to me proactively and when I told him that my Razor Saver was damaged in transit, he didn&#x27;t hesitate to ship me a new one at no cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to exploring Sustainable Village&#x27;s storefront in the future.</li>
    <li> These things really work. I&#x27;ve used mine for 3 years, every day. I average 8 months out of razor. I&#x27;d say the sharpness is about 92% of a brand-new razor, which means I get a perfectly good shave (very close, no nicks) continuously. Due to the narrowness of the plastic groove not all razor manufacturers product will work. I only use Gillette Mach-3 blades: they&#x27;re a 3-blade&#x27;r that comes with a fixed handle. For me, they&#x27;ve been the best. If you prefer 4 or 5 blade razors realize the more blades, the more surface, so more strokes to sharpen it. Also, more blades makes it tough to get the angle right... impossible really. So, a 3 blade&#x27;r is optimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a few reviews that criticize the use of glass as the sharpening mechanism. Nonsense! Glass is actually superior to all other hones except an exotic Japanese wet-stone (that&#x27;s VERY susceptible to nicks or cracking). To make the hone on this sharpener the glass is &#x27;frosted&#x27; into a 2 micron surface. Since glass&#x27;s shear factor is stronger than steel, the frosting acts like a long lasting abrasive. Glass never warps and is cheap to make perfectly level. So, it&#x27;s superior (cost wise) to a wet-stone or even a diamond impregnated steel substrate. I&#x27;m still on my original Razor Saver rand it&#x27;s been 3 years of every-other day use. BTW, these make a GREAT Christmas present to your co-worker buddies. I give 3 or 4 away each year... and I include ONE Mach-3 blade to assure the user has a good experience and knows not all blades will fit in this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, trick is to avoid killing the temper on the edge of the blade. So, hold it under the tap to keep the blades cooled and slide the blade at a moderate pace. No need to press hard.  Do the cycle about 8 times. On the last two strokes, go a little slower to put a fine hone to the edge and you&#x27;ll get a remarkably good shave. After a few months the tempered edge is worn away and halfway through the shave it needs to be sharpened again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give about 3 of these things away each year as Christmas presents (to men and women). They always frown in disbelief and do a &#x27;ahh huh?&amp;#34; kinda like, &amp;#34;Sure... sharpen my used razor blades? We&#x27;ll see.&amp;#34;)  But within about a week I ALWAYS get a call and they cannot believe how good it works and love the idea of not buying expensive blades anymore. They think I&#x27;m a clever guy. Nah... I&#x27;m just cheap.  :)  BTW, a little advice:  Do NOT give them as a present where it will be opened in front of people you don&#x27;t know well. The very idea of sharpening your own blades is so foreign to most Americans that everybody&#x27;s gonna roll their eyes at your stupid present. LOL. Seriously. This is one of those more &#x27;thoughtful&#x27; presents that has to be given (and opened) in private. Trust me on this guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that supper cheapy throw-away blades don&#x27;t work well cause they just don&#x27;t use as a good a steel. You can sharpen them, but halfway through the shave it&#x27;s pulling at your whiskers. And, I&#x27;ve found that 4-blade razors (the &#x27;Quatros&#x27;, or the beautiful &amp;#34;Harry&#x27;s Razors&amp;#34; brand) won&#x27;t work cause the blade&#x27;s plastic housing is higher than the blade edges. (I&#x27;m suspecting manufacturers have caught-on to the threat from razor-sharpeners and are now deliberately designing their newer blades so they can&#x27;t be sharpened.

    <li> I have used the razor savor for several weeks and I feel that it works as advertised. I did not start with a new blade but I follow the enclosed directions and have been enjoying a smooth shave with the same set of blades. I compared the shave using another razor blade in another razor I have I could definitely tell the difference. What convinced me to buy the razor saver was the other reviews and I am glad I purchase this product and yes I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I am all for doing what we can to clean up the planet, and this is a great small investment that everyone who uses disposable razors should own.  I rarely have to buy new razors.  I have been using this product for years, only bought a new one because I dropped the old one on a tile floor.  ;(  So glad to have a new one.  I have used this product for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat RunningElk&lt;br /&gt;www.catrunningelk.com</li>
    <li> Was very surprised, but it does work. For $10, its terrific.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but I really wanted this to be real so I did a control test for myself with a 1 week old Sensor blade first. I sharpened it for 3 weeks more with the Razor Saver and it never gave me razor burn or failed to shave close and smooth. In honesty it did not feel quite like a shave from a brand new razor, BUT after the first sharpening it felt far improved than the week old razor (6 face shaves for me and one leg shave for my wife), and never felt like any older than maybe a 2 or 3 shave razor. I switched to a new blade and ran it for 5 weeks and it never felt worse than that. Even my wife didn&#x27;t complain shaving her legs with something that old. SOLD!</li>
    <li> Bought this in December 2013, and have used it for 11 months now.  Yes, it does keep the razor blades sharp - I went from replacing Gillette cartridges from every month to every 3 months.  A big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given the product a 5-star, but the negative is that the item is not sturdy.  The sharpening plate developed cracks after 10 months of use, with shaving every 3-4 days.  With these cracks it is no longer able to keep the blades as sharp as before.&lt;br /&gt;I am debating whether to buy a new one, or go for a different, more expensive brand.  If I have to buy one of these every year at $10 - that is equivalent to using ~3 cartridges - the original savings rationale for buying this becomes much weaker.</li>
    <li> This will save you a hundred dollars per year.  A blade costs about $2 and lasted me about a week before the Razor Saver.  I&#x27;ve now been able to get through a year on 3 blades.  $6 versus $104</li>
    <li> This product really does make your razor last longer.  I am getting anywhere from 2-4 times longer from each razor.  The shave isn&#x27;t quite as smooth as a brand new razor, but nothing is that smooth.  This little product is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Who&#x27;d a thunk it?&lt;br /&gt;This inexpensive device really works!&lt;br /&gt;I first used it on a Schick disposable that was worn enough to start to nick. 15 - 20 passes, under running water and the razor was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;I have since used it every other shave, on newer razors, with great results.&lt;br /&gt;I imagine this will save many dollars buying less razors.&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending this saver and buying as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I have been using this great device for 3 months. During that time I have been using the same 4 disposable razors!&lt;br /&gt;I hone them and put 2 in the bathroom and 2 in  my travel bag, as I travel, for work, often. I use each razor 3 or 4 times and then re-hone and repeat the cycle. Amazing! I would likely have gone through 12 razors, in this time and the 4 I&#x27;ve been rotating show no signs of giving up.&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Bought it at the beginning of july and have been using it since then.  Seemed to working, was able to use a fusion blade till now - generally I get three good shaves out of it - this so far doubled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the \\&quot;glass\\&quot; piece inside broken write down the middle the last time I used it. Great while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Received an email from seller that they will send a new to me - I&#x27;ll leave the product rating at 3 stars for now, but the seller is 5 stars for sure.</li>
    <li> Pros:  My Harry&#x27;s brand razors are cleaner and get a few more uses.  Without careful documentation, I would estimate 2-3 times more use.  That makes me happy.  Though, I would not agree that I can use it 100 times, like the package claims.&lt;br /&gt;I just tried it with a disposable Bic, and I am happier with this combo.&lt;br /&gt;Less waste.&lt;br /&gt;Closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The enclosure is too narrow and short for a Harry&#x27;s razor, so I am not sure if I am holding it at the optimal angle.  I&#x27;ve removed the glass piece from the plastic enclosure.  To use, I place it on a flat surface.  It&#x27;s a little awkward to hold down with my fingers of one hand, with the razor in the other.  Because of the flexible neck of the razor, it is tricky to get the blades to contact the glass with enough pressure or at the right angle.  Then I have to also get water on it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s complicated, but worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> My Sensor Excel blades usually last under a week;  the Razor Saver puts a sharper edge on them from the first shave, and they&#x27;ve been lasting a month.  Been sharpening knife blades for over 50 years, axes, planes etc -- this does work!!!</li>
    <li> Not noticeably effective.</li>
    <li> I like savings money and this products does it.</li>
    <li> This actually works much to my surprise.&lt;br /&gt;When I first took it out of the box, my girlfriend laughed and thought I got ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a shot with my Mach III blades and much to my surprise, it prolonged the life of the blades significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very unusual facial hair in that it&#x27;s dense and strong. I can destroy a typical high-end blade in three uses - just under a weeks time. When you do the math, its gets really expensive for me so this probably prolonged each blade a good three times. It seems costly at first but it does pay for itself over time (quickly in my case.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other steps I&#x27;ve learned over the years is to make sure to shake off excess water from the blades. Also to quickly dry them along a towel because microscopically they will warp and rust otherwise. It also helps to put the blade and handle blade-side down so that the water runs off easier. Last but not least, you can try soaking them in old-fashioned Barbacide which kills bacteria and prevents rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I pressed a little too hard one day and broke the mirrored surface. I tried the Razer Buddy instead (the black plastic model with the blue rubberized top) and have to say that it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this. In fact I just dumped it in the recycle bin. Will go back to this model.</li>
    <li> This sharpener makes a noticeable difference in longevity of Fusion razor blades. I generally would get one week&#x27;s use out of a Fusion cartridge but since using the Razor Saver I am on week 3 of same razor and it performs as 3-4 days old. This inexpensive sharpener will pay for itself in less than 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Wow this razor saver is absolutely incredible. I can&#x27;t believe this isn&#x27;t selling like wildfire at every major retailer. If you save a razor, you&#x27;ve made your money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this on both disposable and &#x27;regular&#x27; razors like a hydro 5/mach 5, and it&#x27;s done wonderful. This is a great product and u highly recommend it. I&#x27;ll be coming back to buy more for gifts.</li>
    <li> Have used the same razor for 2 months shaving 3 times a week.  It really works.  My son has also been using it for that length of time sharpening his one razor all that time.</li>
    <li> I would say this product roughly doubles the life of my Gillette Sensor blades.  At the price it will pay for itself over time.  Claims of 50 shaves seem over rated to me, but everyone&#x27;s beard is different.</li>
    <li> Great product and regret not knowing of it before hand. Bought it over a month ago and still using the same razor blade with great results (shave 3-4 times per week). Really easy to use. A real no brainner.</li>
    <li> Poor product. Waste of time and money. Am I really supposed to think that running my razor across a piece of glass is going to do any good? In my opinion this product is useless. A few backwards passes across the palm of your hand works great.</li>
    <li> I uses Gillette Fusion blades, and normally get up to 5 shaves before changing blades .  When using the Razor Saver, I change blades after 50. This means each shave over 50 shaves reduced the cost of my $3.00 blade to 6 cents per blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous cost was $3.00 divide by 5 ( shaves) &#x3D;$.60 per blade use. That is a savings of .54 cents per blade when using the sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the Razor Shaver- I bought 73 blades a year at a cost of $3.00 each for a total of  $219.00&lt;br /&gt;AFter using the Razor Shaver- I will buy 7.3 blades at a cost of $3.00 each for a total of  $  21.90&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annual savings $ 197.10</li>
    <li> Great product just put your razor under running water for 10 seconds at 45 degree angel or so, moving it back and forth with regular pressure. That&#x27;s it you can visually see the blades shinier at the tips and feel the difference. Whenever you feel they&#x27;re not as sharp as the last shaves about 10 or more uses  do it again it takes about 10 seconds anyway. great product nothing to break or waste.</li>
    <li> This thing works!  Using it on worn out blades give you that &amp;#34;first shave with a blade&amp;#34; feeling every time.</li>
    <li> My husband wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the product....</li>
    <li> barely givng sharp blades. but it&#x27;s useful enough to save some money in the long run. maybe using one blade at least 15 times.</li>
    <li> This device may work for basic shaving blades but I found it difficult to use for today&#x27;s &#x27;fancy&#x27; disposable blades. I could never get it to sharpen anything in my shaving bag.</li>
    <li> Normally, I go through new razor blades at least once per week. My facial hair is really brittle, so even a brand new razor will often pull the hairs out instead of cutting them. This always necessitates showering after a shave to clean up what looks like cuts (but really just torn out stubble).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has device has been absolutely amazing - I have used the same blade over 30 times now, it&#x27;s still sharp, it rarely tears out my stubble, and the &amp;#34;moisture strip&amp;#34; is long gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m shocked that I hadn&#x27;t heard of these sooner... The product is very simple. It&#x27;s basically a mirror that has been cut to the correct size for razor blades, and a casing for safety and ease of use. I&#x27;m sure this costs virtually nothing to make in terms of materials, but it&#x27;s definitely sturdy and substantially simpler than making your own.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well have honed a couple of razors I use it with shaving cream to get it to slide effortlessly.</li>
    <li> I use the Gillette Flex ball and saw no visible difference in the sharpness of the blade</li>
    <li> This Razor Saver does exactly as it says.  I&#x27;ve had the sharpener for over a month and I am on my second razor.  Every shave it better and closer than the first shave you get with a new razor.  I don&#x27;t gush over products too much, but I am more than happy with this little gizmo.  Works well and saves me money in a place where I always felt gouged before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if they can only help me save on ink cartridges.</li>
    <li> This product really works! I cannot believe how much money we are saving on razors. My husband says it&#x27;s like using a new blade every day. I bought one for my son, and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on 27 days ago, and have actually had it for about 23 days now.  I shave every other day using a Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor, and I typically get about three weeks on a new blade.  I was just at the end of the third week when I got my razor saver and have been able to continue using the same blade without problems up to this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes:&lt;br /&gt; - I really like this item, and it&#x27;s absolutely worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt; - The slot at the top is a bit tight for the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor, but works if you slide the blade in first instead of the handle.&lt;br /&gt; - I have noticed that the sharpening area is a few mm smaller than the razor blade, and has resulted in a dull spot near the left edge of the razor.  I can compensate for this by adjusting the position while sharpening, but I do wish it was a tad bigger.&lt;br /&gt; - I have sensitive skin, and have not had any issues with irritation from using this product, which I had thought may happen.</li>
    <li> When I opened this package, I had a Monty Python &amp; The Holy Grail moment. Instead of a cute little bunny in front of a cave, I held this simple white plastic chunk with a slab of glass glued to the bottom. I felt like shouting, &amp;#34;You silly sod! You got us all worked up!&amp;#34; I paid ten bucks for this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even took out my pair of tin clips and hacked apart the opening since it was too narrow for my Fusion Proglide Styler, or any razor with a fat handle, which seems to be the norm these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple. Plastic. Glass. I tell you, it&#x27;s no ordinary sharpener! It really does devour dull blades and spits out sharpness like that cute little bunny with a mean streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be deceived by its looks. It&#x27;s nasty effective. But, just like there is something deeply wrong with using a cute little bunny to shred apart brave knights, there&#x27;s something wrong with selling a slab of glass for a Hamilton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars only because being Pythoned brought a smile to my nice, smooth, freshly shaved face.</li>
    <li> I have used the same Gilette razor for over a month now and this thing is still sharp. I am running out of shaving cream, my razor last longer then the shaving cream. I am very satisfied with money saved and the frustration of buying new razors which are heavily overpriced. DOUBLE THUMBS UP!</li>
    <li> I thought that I would give this a fair test before passing judgment pro or con. I must start by saying that I prefer a baby butt smooth shave which will use up blades faster, so I was really hoping this was the real thing, unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt; I started with my Gillette fusion which I normally get three shaves from, if anything I got maybe two additional but uncomfortable shaves. So I switched to a Schick Quattro with no noticeable improvement. Then I tried the Dollar Shave four and six blade razors, that was a waste of time from the get go.&lt;br /&gt; I didn&#x27;t want to toss it since so many people had such good things to say about it, so I decided to give it another try with some minor modifications. First I built a portable support stand  for the sink, and a 45° jig for each razor. After doing the 50 recommended strokes I used a can of compressed air to dry the blades. There may have been a one shave improvement, but not the weeks and months some people were getting.&lt;br /&gt; My conclusion is that I am still doing something wrong, or that it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as advertised. I&#x27;ll go with the latter.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome!  There are issues though with the newer model razors with so many blades.  Went back to my old mach 3 and no issues there.  Would not fit some of the razors with more than 3 blades.</li>
    <li> I was able to use it on Gillette men&#x27;s fusion razors. At first it&#x27;s tough getting the razor in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get 4-5 extra shaves out of every blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> Amazingly easy way to reduce waste and save money! Go Green, save green! The planet will thank you! You betcha!</li>
    <li> great product I tried it just to see how it would extend my disposable razors life and this product works great I got 20 shaves with it I probably could have gotten more I will but another soon</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it... Easy and good quality! This was a great investment. A good way to save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these simply because of the price of new blades. The 1st razor I sharpened, after each use, lasted in excess of 2 months. Previously I had been getting 5 or 6 shaves per blade. You will need to get the angle correct in order to sharpen your blades. This takes a bit of practice, but once you get it right, your blades should last much longer. It is fragile so you will need to be careful not to drop it. I am currently on my 2nd disposable razor at the 3 month mark. I like it, and it has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> I read others reviews with interest as I had tried other techniques to keep razors sharp with some success. Namely, rubbing the blade away from you onto a pair of blue jeans..I guess use causes micro burrs that decrease the sharpness of the blades and honing the blades against the appropriate surface gets rid of the burrs..I tried it on several razors and definitely noticed an improved shave. Problem is that not all shavers fit into the enclosure. Another tip is that water is a razors worst friend if it remains on the blade after shaving. I rinse with alcohol after shaving and let air dry. Keeps the rust away. For the price it is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this because I regularly shave me head. I normally go through a razor once every week, so this really adds up. With the razor saver, I can manage to go for nearly a month or so. I do find that it helps to press the razor firmly with warm/hot water. For a while, I was lazy and not pressing hard enough and found that I started nicking myself more cause the razor was not as sharp as it could be. Also, I do a lot of traveling, so usually just throw my razor in a ziploc baggie. I have the Gillette Fusion, so sometimes it gets turned on and wastes the battery (though I don&#x27;t use it this way). But putting the Gillette Fusion in the razor saver, it is protected against accidental turn-ons. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works well with my Gilette Pro Fusion razor.  I was previously going through one razor per week, but now I can extend that out to two or more weeks</li>
    <li> Razor Saver does what it claims. It sharpens razer blades and keeps them sharp for a good shave. So far I have been able to use the same blade for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing you can buy for yourself and or family...... Every one should get one I should have gotten one 10 ten years ago...</li>
    <li> My razors did not fit, and it did not sharpen my boyfriend&#x27;s blades. I might not be doing it right, but I&#x27;ve given up trying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Razor Saver for over a month now and so far so good. I&#x27;ve found it easily triples the life span of a blade I would have previously tossed out.</li>
    <li> I used this device for the first time two days ago.  I moved the razor back and forth the way the instructions said and it dulled my razor.  I shaved and it chewed my face up.  This morning I tried it again, this time moving the razor in an up direction only.  This time it worked great!  It fixed the dullness I imposed on it two days ago and, in fact, it made the edge much better than it was before.  Very good product so far but I need to continue to evaluate it.  Updates to follow.</li>
    <li> It does work because I haven&#x27;t seen a reduction in the quality of my razors.  I do not have to change the razors as often therefore I do not have to spend as much money on refills!!</li>
    <li> If you use a disposable razor to shave then this is a must have. Read the reviews. This thing will save you way more than it&#x27;s cost. I shave my face every day and my head every other and I use the same disposable razor 10-14 days with the help of this razor saver.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but I gave it a chance.  I use the Mach 3 and it fit well within the housing.  Product sharpens as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started on day 1 with an old razor that was about to be thrown out.  Ten seconds with the razor saver and the blade was as good as new.  After a month of use, I&#x27;m still using the same razor.  My wife constantly uses my razor which normally has me switching razors frequently.  After a month of use, the mach 3, long past it&#x27;s expected lifespan continues to cut closely and not pull.  Would give 5 stars but the fragility is concerning.  Don&#x27;t be turned away by the cheesy packaging and small store of the seller, the product delivers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unrelated to it&#x27;s sharpening power, I dropped it in the shower.  The glass broke in half and splintered shards onto the floor.  Luckily, most of the shards were large and I was able to avoid a Die Hard moment.  Would like to see a more resistant product that can handle a fall in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sharpens razor with minimal effort&lt;br /&gt;Extends (at least doubles) the life of the razor&lt;br /&gt;Durable plastic mold&lt;br /&gt;Fast and easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Fragile - I dropped the product from my hand in the shower and it shattered glass onto the tile shower floor.</li>
    <li> Simple design. No moving parts&#x3D;nothing can go wrong.  Restores the sharpness of any blade adequately.  Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Seems extends the life my double blade razor for about a month where I used to get 2 weeks tops.  Probably cut my razor use to about twelve a year. not bad</li>
    <li> My husband shaves daily and is also bald so that includes his head as well.  I bought this after picking up some razors for him one day, and was  SHOCKED !!! at what they cost. I was skeptical to say the least.  This thing has paid for itself time and time again already.  My husband loves it.  If you have any doubts, put em away and buy this little sucker.  It truly is money well spent.</li>
    <li> My husband loves using this. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;sharpen&amp;#34; the blade per se... more helps the blade to maintain an edge over time. The blade does get dull but it takes twice as long. Saved us a lot of money</li>
    <li> This is a big fat ZERO!!!&lt;br /&gt;Product does not sharpen blades at all.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this item complete it is complete JUNK...</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the results basically doubled the blades life.</li>
    <li> When I saw this for $10, I thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;I tried a completely fried blade first, and it really made no discernible difference.&lt;br /&gt;But with two that were not in such bad shape I had great results. They performed like new blades in terms of shave.&lt;br /&gt;So really, I&#x27;d give it a 4.5 if that were an option.</li>
    <li> simple concept that works great, just a great way to help with razor diposal......besides the cost savings&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product</li>
    <li> I hate to shave, mostly because I never seemed to get more than one or two good shaves from a blade before the post-shave me looked as if I had been in a knife fight. And having tried various kinds of razor sharpening gizmos, I was skeptical about the claims for razor nirvana. But I was desperate, too. And after using it for almost six months I can say...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razor Saver is a little twelve dollar miracle. My blades are sharp every time and I haven&#x27;t been in the first aid kit in months after a shave.  A very pleasant side-effect: not so many blades in the landfill (The average blade lasts me two months, shaving two or three times a week) and not so much money spent on blades. The Saver paid for itself in a month, I&#x27;d guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution: this thing is made for old-fashioned Gilette-like cartridge blades. Blades or units that are big and bulky or have weird contours might not fit.</li>
    <li> I love this &amp; I recommended for people to buy this because you could save so much money and this is the good Product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really understand how it works, but it does.  Just a few swipes and the blade is ready for a shave.  It works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Razor Saver for my husband who shaves both his head and face.  Disposable razors last longer.  And what&#x27;s more, we received our purchase very quickly and as we expected.</li>
    <li> Works great with my Mach 3 razor. How is anybody not giving this a minimum of 4 Stars? Are you expecting someone to shave your face too? Simple to use product that works.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband. He said his razors used to last about 2 weeks. Now he can 3 weeks out of them.  Considering how inexpensive this item was, it&#x27;s definitely worth it and will save a lot of money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I use this for my Gilette Power Fusion blades and it doubles my normal use of the blade.  It&#x27;s a little tough getting the blade in the device but it does fit and once in it&#x27;s easy to use.  I would definitely suggest trying this out.</li>
    <li> Sure didn&#x27;t work for me. Made my Gillette Fusion blade worse, not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it again when the new blade starts to get dull, and if it does work I&#x27;ll update this review. But I&#x27;m not holding my breath.</li>
    <li> Works great so far. No complaints I recommend this product. I read the previous reviews so therefore I have nothing to compare it to so all I can say is that it works.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the product at first, but I wanted to try it to be certain. I was amazed at how effective it was and how much money it is saved me over time! This is a product that every person who uses a disposable razor simply MUST have. The money you&#x27;ll save will be absolutely amazing &amp; the fact that it works so easily, as advertised, will cure anyone&#x27;s skepticism!</li>
    <li> Thrilled with this product!! Brilliant design, so simple to use, you CAN&#x27;T screw it up!! Trust me...I KNOW! LOL.  Well done</li>
    <li> Genius! This is a must have for any one interested in saving some money! Great buy. Pick one up today!</li>
    <li> DOES NOT fit a wide blade like Venus. I don&#x27;t know male razors &amp; if they&#x27;re the only ones reviewing this product to give it a decent review! Just don&#x27;t buy if you have a wide razor!!</li>
    <li> Gives longer life to my blades - Gillette and Schick can be so expensive, yet I find blades from other companies rough on my face.  This makes paying for the Gillette blades bearable.</li>
    <li> I had gotten tired of spending the ridiculous amount of money for 5 razors for my Mach 3.  I had watched a show on TV where the talked about razor sharpeners and thought, &amp;#34;Hey I should get one of those.&amp;#34;  I went on Amazon and found this product for a very affordable price.  When it came in the mail I was not very impressed at first.  I followed the directions for sharpening my razor and was shocked how well it worked.  I had stopped using my Mach 3 several months earlier and was using a disposable one. My razor was just as sharp as a new one.  I used it on my disposable razor with the same results.  So for the price I paid I will only buy razors once ever other year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was a bit skeptical of this product but was tired of going through so many blades. I also give credit to the numerous product reviews. I have been shaving daily with the same blade for 3 weeks and going strong. I use the Razor Saver after each shave and dry the blade with a towel.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband, and it didn&#x27;t really work. In fact, it made the razors duller than they were when he used a towel and a hair dryer, so this was definitely a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible item. Rather than change blades every 2 weeks, I have gone a month and the blade is as sharp as the day I first changed it. Good product good value.</li>
    <li> The razors these days are incredibly pricey, this prolongs their useable life by a lot. Easy to use. Good price.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to find something that lengthens life of razors (razors priced way too high imo).  Just follow directions and it will lengthen life of razors for a long time.</li>
    <li> This product has saved me a lot of money on razors and works well.  It is worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I haven&#x27;t bought new razors in months. It&#x27;s not completely perfect, eventually the razors stop sharpening, but it still pays for itself over and over. I&#x27;m a very satisfied user. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using this sharpener for several months now on my Gillette Mach III razors and I have probably gotten about 30 extra shaves out of my last razor before I finally threw it away because I felt sorry for it.  After awhile the razors finally start to fall apart, so it&#x27;s time to just get rid of them.  This honing stone does an excellent job of sharpening razorblades.  I will say though that the sharpened edge you put on the blade after running it through the block several times will not last as long as the original new blade&#x27;s edge did at first, but it&#x27;s no big deal though, as all you need to do is just keep putting it back in the block and sharpening up every so often. Is definitely worth the money you pay for it, and it will pay for itself in a matter of weeks.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me state that I was skeptical (to say the least) when I purchased this item.  But, for the price I was willing to take the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG - my expectations for the Razor Saver have clearly been EXCEEDED!  Hence, the 5 star rating.  Right now, I&#x27;m on my sixth month using the Razor Saver and all I can say is that this really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an every day shaver, all I do is sharpen the blades once a week and I&#x27;m good to go.  I&#x27;m on my second blade in six months, but that&#x27;s only because the pivot on my first blade broke (which of course, had nothing to do with the Razor Saver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you hate spending money on blades and enjoy getting a good close shave every day, the Razor Saver is for you.</li>
    <li> This is a plastic shell with a glass mirror glued inside, that&#x27;s all. It&#x27;s a lot of money for what it is. You could just rub your razor back and forth across your bathroom mirror and get the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presumably, the glass acts as a strop to hone the blades of a safety razor. But this broke before I could determine if it helped keep my razors sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has zero tolerance for being dropped. Given that it is something expected to be used in a shower/bathroom, and that it shatters after a 3-foot drop into a tub, it is hard to recommend, since it&#x27;s value for sharpening razors drops to zero if you drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the manufacturers use a soft, compliant adhesive to hold the glass into the plastic case, e.g. silicone sealant. This would make it less likely to shatter while not affecting the performance of the prodcut/</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard but still have to shave every day.  Usually I get about 1 1/2 weeks out of my razor.  Now, I get almost a month out of one plus it&#x27;s pretty simple to use since I shave in the shower. I don&#x27;t know how long this sharpener will last so I might have to buy a spare one!</li>
    <li> Save you a lot of money  I recommend this product 100% after you use this product you pocket will fill the difference.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Shave my face and head almost every day. Have saved quite a bit on razor blades by using this product. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This works really great!  It keeps all of razors nice and sharp; really extends the life of a blade.&lt;br /&gt;Also, does an excellent job of eliminating razor burn!  Great invention!</li>
    <li> I used to always use my Norelco electric from day to day, and go to my Mach3 when I want a good shave.  My perception was that blade shaving took too long and I certainly did not like the cost of refill blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, recently I lost the charger for my razor and did not want to run out and buy a new one, so I started using my Mach3 more frequently.  I found that I could get about a month&#x27;s worth of shaves before the razor was too dull to stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using the same razor for about 3 months;  I started honing it on the Razor Saver after the little blue indicator strip wore out on the blade.  I give it about 5 strokes before sharpening.  Today I shaved half my face with a new razor and half with my resharpened razor, and neither I nor my wife could tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using it with both Mach3 disposable and refillable razors and both work great!</li>
    <li> I used to change my blade about every 10 days but after using the Razor Saver, I now change it once a month.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> Awesome product , really brings new life to old worn down razor blades</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. It looks like a priece of mirror attached to a plastic holder. You&#x27;re supposed to put a little water on the mirror and rub your razor back and forth at least 10 times at a 45 degree angle. The two different razors I tried didn&#x27;t seem noticeably sharper.</li>
    <li> This is a most valuable compact device that literally prolongs razor life by time frames measured in weeks, not days.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this product, and it has more than lived up to its claims.  I have gotten the closest shaves ever, and my blade is more than a month old.  It is very simple to use.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to write reviews. But for this product I will. I&#x27;ve only had this product for about three weeks. I shave everyday and I havn&#x27;t change blades since I started using the razor saver. Without the razor saver I would have changed blades about nine times. So I think that tells the whole story. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. It meets all my expectations.</li>
    <li> I was tired of having to throw out expensive blades after just over a week of use, so I tried cheaper disposable razors. They were garbage by the second day. I got the razor saver a couple days before my order of new blades and tried it on the disposable. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t opened the new blades! The razor saver sharpened the disposable razor better than new. I run the blades back and forth for about 20 seconds (maybe 40 - 60 strokes which is more than the instructions say so I may be doing more than I need to. The cheap disposable razor shaves as good or better than a 4 or 5 blade razor that&#x27;s costs $2 or $3 each.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like the Razor Saver.  In theory it should work really well.  In my experience I just bought a small piece of mirror in a plastic housing.  Either way you look at it, either the mirror is too wide or the plastic housing is too small to really get at the blades of your razor.  I use a Mach 3 and with how the metal at the ends of the blade extrude to encase the blades, you end of scraping at metal instead of the blades.</li>
    <li> Save your money and just rub your razor across the mirror you look at when you shave. There&#x27;s absolutely nothing special about this product. No angle guide, no special type of glass, nothing. I saw no difference in the sharpness or longevity of my Mach 5 blades.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to find a product that does what it claims to do.  This is such a product.  I&#x27;ve had it about 5 months now and use it almost daily to sharpen razors for beard trimming and shaping.  I&#x27;m into shaping my beard using shave oil so I&#x27;m a little fussy about the results.  Older razors perform like new for a week or so using this product.  They are still OK for a week or so after that.  Before using the Razor Saver razors would be almost useless within a couple days.  Having this tool has enabled me to sharpen razors nicely and get the results I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;does what it says.</li>
    <li> When I took it out, I thought no way this thing is gonna do anything, but somehow it does (I guess it&#x27;s just removing the gunk from the blade, not really sharpening it). Whatever, there is clearly a difference for the better. Some criticize it saying that they could do the same thing some other way. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true, but this way works pretty damn good. That&#x27;s what I paid for, not to start some science experiment into blade sharpening.</li>
    <li> Anybody that can&#x27;t notice a difference hasn&#x27;t sharpened an old  blade. Obviously there won&#x27;t be much of a difference with anything relatively new. I shave once a week and try to keep razors as long as possible. I don&#x27;t use shaving cream so I like a really sharp blade. I had my current razor for 6 months and was getting ready to throw it away before getting this sharpener. After following the directions, my old raggedy razor was like new. I won&#x27;t be surprised if it lasts another year or more.</li>
    <li> I ordered the razor saver as a gift. It arrived in good time and was given as a gift for Christmas. Good price and wonderful money saving idea.</li>
    <li> I think this was my husband&#x27;s favorite Christmas present this year. Works great and has definitely saved us money on blades!</li>
    <li> Love love love love this little gadget. It extends the life of my razors from a few days to a few weeks. Wouldn&#x27;t want to live without one ... unless I was growing a full beard.</li>
    <li> I reviewed several products that promised to be &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; razor sharpener, but found their reviews to be lacking in proof, except for this one, so I bought it, hoping to extend the life of my husbands Gillette razor blades as well as my Gillette Venus women&#x27;s razor blades. I go through blades faster than my hubby since he doesn&#x27;t shave often and I have to regularly, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to make them last longer. This product advertises that it works for women&#x27;s blades too, but that&#x27;s only if they are skinny enough to fit it properly. My Venus blades are too wide and have to be turned sideways and rubbed side to side then a couple times the short width of the unit to sharpen. It still got the blade sharper, but since it doesn&#x27;t fit the proper direction I am giving it a 4 star rating, other than that, I am happy with the sharpener, it is as advertised aside from women&#x27;s common razors. Please note, if your razor head is larger than 1 3/4&amp;#34; wide, it will not fit through the opening the right way, but good news, it will still work, somewhat, turned sideways, and will still save you money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I originally gave this 5 stars because it seemed to work great. After a little time I realized that I was getting the same usage out of my Gillette Fusion blades as I normally do. I am in the military. I shave my entire head as well as my face everyday for work so I go through a ton of razors, at least one a week. After a few days the Fusion blades get dull and really start to irritate my skin. This product does not actually sharpen the razors, it is just a piece of glass glued inside a plastic case.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t notice any difference.  I use the Gillette Fusion Mach 5&#x27;s...maybe if I&amp;#34;m lucky I get 1 extra shave with this....tops...which extends it all the way to 3. Not really that useful in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend ordered this to maintain his razors. Maybe he and I aren&#x27;t using it right, because we really don&#x27;t notice a difference in the longevity of our razors with or without it. Instructions would have been helpful; we resorted to referencing the product picture on this page to make sure we were holding the razor in the right direction. Beyond all of this, the casing around the glass sharpener was too small to fit his razors. He had to break it open and pry the glass piece out to even use it. All this appears to be is a piece of glass in some fancy plastic housing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have an electric motorized Shaver Saver and thought this was motorized too. It&#x27;s not. When I opened the box and found that it was essentially a mirror glued to the bottom of a plastic housing I thought I&#x27;d been taken.  On a whim before sending it back, I decided I owed it to myself to at least try it. Wow - was I surprised!  I don&#x27;t know how, but it works even better than the electric one with no moving parts or batteries to replace - go figure.</li>
    <li> The mirror like surface that you drag your razor across began to crumble after only three uses.  Piece of crap.  Can&#x27;t believe it got so many good reviews.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  My razor doesn&#x27;t fit.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I clearly do not understand the intersection of brand influence, advertising monies, world economics, and common sense, because this thing ABSOLUTELY and significantly lengthens the life of even cheap disposables, and I fail to see why this product or ones like it aren&#x27;t in every home.  Something this simple and effective could destroy entire divisions at Gillette, for just one example.  I now have three in my household-  one for each of us that shaves.  The product itself is inexpensively made and neither complex nor exceptionally crafted, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see tough competition spring up, but for the nonce it seems to be the best bargain on the planet and fun to use besides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would make a terrific stocking stuffer for Christmas.  Happy Holidays.</li>
    <li> It definately works. I must admit I was quite surprised. It greatly extends the life of my razor blades! Get one it really works:-).</li>
    <li> Maybe it does better for cheap disposable razors, I tried the product with a halfway decent cartridge razor. 1) the blade guide was always in the way. 2) if anything it made the blade dull faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note I have no complaint for the seller, as it was on time and what they said it was.</li>
    <li> Cannot believe how well this sharpener works.  bought one for myself and gave two away as gifts and people are telling me they are taking very old Fusion blades and sharpening them better than new.. cannot believe I waited this long to get one of these..  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I had never even heard of razor sharpeners until I something on TV about one.  I went onto Amazon and found this wonderful little gem.  I use the Mach 3 blades and usually only got about a month&#x27;s use out of one blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my Razor Saver and immediately pulled out my old blade.  It had been sitting in it&#x27;s stand for over a month since I had stopped using it because it was so dull. I had purchase some disposables which were useless after two shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions that came with it and sharpened my dull blade.  It was like new!  I used it for another 2 months before I finally broke down a bought a new set of blades.  I am still using the first one now and it&#x27;s been 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be underwhelmed when it arrives since it is such a simple looking thing, BUT IT WORKS!  I love it.</li>
    <li> I use Sensor on a stiff beard.  I get 4 months of shaves wiith each blade before the sharpening stops working.  I don&#x27;t really care how much I&#x27;m saving--someone else can calculate it.  I just get a kick from &amp;#34;beating the system&amp;#34; in this tiny way.  For the price of this sharpener, it&#x27;s cheapest, best little kick I know of! Viva la revolucion.</li>
    <li> Little bit of shaving cream, and 15 strokes with your razor on the pad, and your blade is sharpened.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product Does what is described . I have as of now extended my triple blade Razor life by 3 weeks .</li>
    <li> The Razor Saver works like magic on my family&#x27;s razors- all different kinds- and makes them just as good as new. This will save lots of money over time.&lt;br /&gt;I checked out the other similar products carefully before choosing this one. I wish it came with a sturdy case though. I have it put up in a safe place so it won&#x27;t get broken.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t put too much pressure on it or you&#x27;ll break that glass.</li>
    <li> Worst purchase ever.  Mine arrived with a broken glass and my friend is still trying to get one good shave since he bought this device 5 months ago.</li>
    <li> I recommend this gadget to extend the useful life of your razor blades. It is easy to use and saves money!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Works like a charm!! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I probably dont use it as most others, with the intention of prolonging the life of the blade.  Rather I use a disposable and my goal is to sharpen the blade for the best shave. The Razor Shaver helps me get a better shave!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, I figured I was probably just throwing my money away but decided it was worth a shot. I typically use the Venus razor blades, and since I shave every day they wear out quickly. At the price for refill blades, I thought that I would give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I shave my legs with a new blade and have no stubble at all for ~2 days (I&#x27;ve never skipped shaving more than that but I&#x27;m sure it would start being noticeable any longer than 2 days). As the blade starts to dull, I begin to notice more stubble the next day. Once I realize that I am really noticing stubble less than a day after shaving, I know it&#x27;s time to give up and switch to a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got this product (for Christmas), I was at the point where I was about to switch to a new blade. I figured I&#x27;d give this thing a try and see how it did. It is now the end of the first week in March and I am finally about to switch to a new blade. The razor saver basically gave me an extra 2+ months on my razor blade. I honestly could not be more surprised that it worked at all, let alone that it has worked so well that I have gotten this much time out of one blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to rub the blade ~10 times back and forth, but I just hold it under the shower and quickly run it back and forth a bunch of times (definitely more than 10). I had a little trouble figuring out the angle to hold it at since the blades pivot as you use them but I just try to make sure the blade portion is totally flat and I am putting a decent amount of pressure down at the 45 degree angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about ordering this but I am very glad I did. I will probably be ordering some as gifts for next year. I am so happy with this item, that instead of just deleting the email asking me to leave feedback, I actually came here and did it (and I&#x27;m lazy so that&#x27;s saying something haha)! I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work with the double edge razors, but with my Venus and my ladies&#x27; disposables, it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend giving this a try!us and my ladies&#x27; disposables, it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend giving this a try!</li>
    <li> after researching much more expensive ones i decided to give this one a go. At christmas i bought one for my father in law who shaves everyday and one for my husband and myself. (we all use mach 3 razors)happy to say we are all using our same razor blades since christmas. i also love that this purchase supports small business. at 15 dollars i think its worth a go when you consider the savings over buying razors.. it is not fancy but does work.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not completely convinced it&#x27;s anything more than a placebo effect, but it seems to work. Placebo or not, it&#x27;s saving me money.</li>
    <li> Works well, still figuring out how to best use it, but I definitely have been getting an extra week or two at least per razor, which will save me a lot (at $3/razor that I purchase).</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but after a month of use, I&#x27;ve learned how to use the Razor Saver effectively and easily get twice the life out of my Mach 3 blades(2 vs. 1 week).  I don&#x27;t sharpen for about five days, then every three days or so thereafter, sharpen and notice a significant difference in the effectiveness of the blades. Well-worth the relatively small investment given that I&#x27;m now buying 1/2 the razor blades!</li>
    <li> Recently received it, have sharpened 2 razors, it appears to be an excellent addition to my shaving kit. I believe the purchase price&lt;br /&gt;was money well spent.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve only used this twice now. Once for my razor and once for my husband&#x27;s. He definitely noticed a difference, and he would since he shaves a full beard every time he does. He said it felt like he was using a brand new razor. For me, I don&#x27;t shave too often (yay laser treatment!) but it&#x27;s so nice to see that I&#x27;ll never have to buy a new razor again. My razor will last me forever and I noticed the fresh shave it gives me when I sharpened my razor too. I&#x27;ll admit...I kind of wondered if I was actually accomplishing anything since the actual sharpening process is very easy and doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re doing anything, but the results speak volumes! Thank you for an ingenious product that makes our products better and our lives less wasteful!</li>
    <li> Functionality points: 4/5  Durability points: 2/5  Final score: 3/5&lt;br /&gt;This item consists of a thin strip of glass enclosed in a rigid plastic housing.  The housing is removable - but I haven&#x27;t found the need to.  I suppose that would be handy for you if you used a razor that didn&#x27;t fit into the slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass split in two the first time I used it. Fortunately it is attached to the housing at multiple points so while I no longer have a single continuous strip of glass the two halves are still in place and potentially usable.  So now even though I cannot swipe my razor the full length of the device the half strip still gives good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Gillette Fusion Power set.  The design of the Fusion handle includes a rounded area around the pivot point so the razor doesn&#x27;t fit as comfortably in the device as one might like - and doesn&#x27;t allow it to be inserted at the recommended angle - but if you slant the Fusion to a very acute angle you can get it in and still do your sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  Yes it does.  My blade gets sharpened and I&#x27;m able to get VERY close shaves way beyond my previous discard date.  I shave 7 days a week so Fusions usually last me 5 or 6 days - by the 7th day I&#x27;m struggling to get a clean shave.  With this device I&#x27;m on day 20+ and still getting super-smooth shaves.  Completely stubble-free.  Interestingly, my shaves seem to be a bit easier now - it may be my mind playing tricks on me but it does seem like the blade is sliding more smoothly across my face now than when it was brand new.  No snagging, no tugging, no nicks.  I use a Gillette foam and the overall experience is smooth and almost effortless.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Razor Saver a couple times a week.  Simply insert the razor and press it against the glass with a pushing motion - (opposite to the pulling motion used for shaving).  All this is done under running water - and presto!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other products in this category that probably work as well, and are definitely more durable.  But this does the job good enough for me and for its price, its a winner.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for results, not build quality.well, and are definitely more durable.  But this does the job good enough for me and for its price, its a winner.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for results, not build quality.</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t post reviews on Amazon (or anywhere else for that matter) but when I find a product that&#x27;s really outstanding I feel that I should.  The Razor Saver while overpriced is still worth the investment if like me you&#x27;re using outrageously overpriced disposable razor blades.  I&#x27;ve been using this thing for about a month now.  I don&#x27;t have to shave every day (I&#x27;m retired. What can I tell ya?) so the Gillette Mach III that I use tend to last a little longer anyway.  BUT I&#x27;ve been using this thing to &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; the blade every time before I use it.  I&#x27;ll be dipped.  The damn thing works!  And it works really well.  I&#x27;m getting shaves with an at least month old blade that feel as good as a brand new blade.  I am not exaggerating.  I&#x27;m convinced this is not a placebo effect but the real deal.  Yeah it&#x27;s over priced but you&#x27;ll recoup your investment in short order believe me.  If you have to shave every day or have a heavy beard (I don&#x27;t) OR YOUR A HEAD SHAVER (!),  do yourself a favor and buy one of these things.  You&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
    <li> It seems to work well, but I don&#x27;t know how. Sustainable Village told me they use a glass with just enough grit to sharpen the razor blades, similar to using ceramic rods to fine sharpen knife blades. I use the Gillette Fusion cartridges, I only shave 3 days a week and they lasted about 4 months. Now, I don&#x27;t remember the last time I changed a cartridge.</li>
    <li> If you take the time to look at my past reviews, I am kind of a shaving buff. I have bought and used a myriad of shaving items over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I shave my head everyday, and therefore I greatly appreciate a good shave.  The downside of my shaving routine, is the lack of durability of today&#x27;s high end disposable razors.  My go to razor is the Schick Hydro 5. To me it gives the best shave, and lasts a decent two weeks.  Well, with using the Razor Saver, it got 4.5 weeks of head shaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed, I ended up dropping some cash on the uber-expensive Gillette Pro-Glide. Yes, I also got 4 weeks out of one of those!! In fact, the lube strip is totally white (which means it has to be replaced) and yet, I have it so sharp, that it actually \\&quot;squeaks\\&quot; when I shave my scalp with American Crew Shaving Oil or King of Shaves Alpha Gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to put these bigger headed blades on the RS, the opposite way than what it shows on the picture. My razor handle is on the right side, if that amkes sense.  Still works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say after I sharpen the blades on the Razor Saver, I dry the blades on a dry towel, using a forward stropping manuever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the Razor Saver makes it much more cost effective to shave with today&#x27;s best but also most expensive razors. The Razor Saver pays for itself quickly.</li>
    <li> The seller was great, delivery arrived very timely!  The razor shaver, may be I am doing something wrong.  I thought that it suppose to sharpen the blades on the razor.  I will try to stroke the razor for longer time than I did and see what will happen.  For now I give this thing only 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t work for me yet.  If it does, I will come back with updated information and change the rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am back, after using this utensil for a while, now I understand what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  I thought that it will sharpen the blades, but it hones them.  It really works very well (changing rating to 5 stars), just don&#x27;t let your blade get super dull before you will use the razor saver. By the way, thank you for your educating comment skyhorse, you opened my eyes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over three months and it works great. I shave my whole head and face every 2-3 days and I&#x27;m only on my 3rd blade</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe this would work but it does. I am a convert and saving on razors</li>
    <li> This allowed me to use a razor for a month rather than just two shaves.  Seems worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I use this on my cheap BIC disposable razors and after about 20 uses of the razor I am still using it like the first time (minus the little lotion strip thing which fades fast). I typically shave in the shower and right afterwards use the Razor Saver to sharpen the razor and then dry it and put it back in the shower. My only complaint is the opening for the razor isn&#x27;t quite wide enough for the BIC razors. I have to turn the razor and give a firm push to get it into the slot. Otherwise, works great for me!</li>
    <li> Blades definitely last longer when using the Razor Saver.  I would not personally say that it makes the blade &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a good shave and the device will certainly pay for itself.</li>
    <li> Received this item and am very happy with this purchase.  Good quality for such a low prices and it came to me fast.  Now I can use my razor blade multiple times.  Happy to save $$ from not having to buy more razor blades for a longer period of time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It actually works! I had the same razor in the academy for 4 months and it was still sharp enough to shave well. Great product</li>
    <li> At first I was very unsure of how it worked, but I was told it was worked by a friend who&#x27;d suggested it. Once I got it home and tried it out, it was actually pretty obvious. The glass inside the holder acts like a steel does for a chef&#x27;s knife. Not really sharpening, but straightening out small imperfections. With razors blades on most modern cartridges being so slim, it doesn&#x27;t take all that much to straighten things out a bit. I&#x27;ve probably tripled the life of each cartridge with this. Definitely pays for itself.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Just follow the directions and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> A really excellent product! I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an eco-friendly way to kep your razor going.</li>
    <li> Worked well; blades lasted noticeably longer. However, the inner glass cracked after about a year.</li>
    <li> Must buy if you feel you&#x27;re spending a lot on disposables. I have a Fusion Pro-Glide and this easily extends its life to 3-4 months. You have to be careful though, if your blade has gone blunt and you sharpen it, and apply the same amount of pressure you will cut yourself. This is obviously not a product failure but in my case a user error. Just go light for a few strokes after sharpening to get used to the feel. Only reason I took off a star is the instructions make no sense and are possibly erroneous!</li>
    <li> Does a great job of removing rough corrosion from razor, rather than truly sharpening.  So, when my razor would normally start to irritate my face, a few quick passes on the Razor Saver, and it glides beautifully for an additional week or so.  Since the razor is not really sharper, just smoother, it does take me more passes the more times I use shave with a given blade.  Effectively doubles the life of a multi-blade razor for me.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I use it for Schick Extreme 3 disposals and it definitely makes them sharper and longer lasting. In fact, on a recent trip I recently started shaving with the Extreme 3 and wondered why it suddenly felt so dull. Answer: I&#x27;d forgotten to pack the Razor Saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product for closer shaves and longer-lasting blades.</li>
    <li> I have had this for over a year and it has saved me a ton of money. I have only spent about twenty bucks on razors in the past year. This is a must buy for any person that shaves.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything useful. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> What a great idea! Why don&#x27;t they sell these in stores? Probably because it competes with razor blade sales. I&#x27;m going to try one of these - they&#x27;re inexpensive, will pay for themselves quickly, and what a boon for the environment. I hate throwing away something as high tech as a razor blade.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I never saw this before!  These things work so damn good I bought 4 to give to every guy in my family JUST BECAUSE I know the pain of shaving.  This gadget is awesome!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but needed something when I saw the 34.00 price tag for 8 cartridges. I read reviews on everything available and decided to go with this sharpener after some research. Got it home and it worked, I wasn&#x27;t surprised after all I made an informed purchase. HOWEVER, I had been using disposables for 8 months now, yesterday I grabbed the disposable out of my over-sized coffee cup in the bathroom, and noticed my old Gillette Fusion sitting there. I thought &amp;#34;What the hell, let see what this thing can do,&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t used that razor in over 8 months, and never changed the cartridge, so it was pretty dried up looking. I ran a nail brush over it to get the stuck on junk out of the way, and then ran it through the sharpener repeatedly. Let me just say that this sharpener works great for disposables, and it works even better on the high dollar blades. That old razor shaved better than I ever remembered. This is a great find. I will be hiding it from my wife.</li>
    <li> Sharpens the razor well before each shave even if they&#x27;re dull and makes them last a lot longer. I highly recommend this product, it could save you a lot of money.</li>
    <li> You have to wonder whether there&#x27;s a conspiracy to keep products like this from the public. It has always seemed so stupid to me that we&#x27;re supposed to get 11 good shaves out of a razor blade, and then just throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor shaver helps you connect your desire to move toward a more sustainable culture with your wanting the good shave only a 2- (or 3- or 4- !!!) blade razor can provide. Just swipe 20 times after each shave, and you&#x27;ll get about 100 excellent shaves out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if they&#x27;ll only figure out a way to replace the comfort strip...</li>
    <li> This product in combination with secret shave lotion provides a close starving experience. Would recommend to individuals dissatisfied with how long their fusion blade is lasting.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I shave with gillete razor blades, now I use this every time before a shave and I definately feel that it renews the blade. If i had to say something negative about this product it would be that the opening to put the razor to guide it is a bit narrowm but it still works fine. I shave twice a week and one blade would last me maybe 2 weeks now with the razor saver It lastest me atleast 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe it works as well as it does.  We are on the same razor blade for months now!</li>
    <li> My first one broke and the company promptly sent me a replacement. They also tried to understand the problem I was having with it, but I just cannot understand how the blade makes contact with the glass/mirror because of the gel pad being in the way.</li>
    <li> Certainly a great product. It practically doubles the life of my blades and combined with Secret Shave, produces a great shave every time.</li>
    <li> The blades I have cleaned/sharpened with it work exactly the same as brand new blades (minus the moisture-strip thingy, which does almost nothing). I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to be sure of a 5-start rating, but that&#x27;s my only hesitation. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I do not know what law of the physics is behind this thing but it does something. I would not say that it sharpens the blade anew but it definitely improves the sharpness of the razor to an extend.</li>
    <li> The Razor Saver ($12.95) actually works.  I had an old two-bladed safety razor ready to be tossed out so I shaved half of my face with it first... ouch.  Then I steeled my old safety razor with the Razor Saver and shaved the other half of my face.  Wow, it was a world of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razor Saver  must \\&quot;steel\\&quot; the razor blades rather than grind and hone them.  The Razor Saver is just a strip of glass inside of a protective plastic enclosure.  Note that a safety razor has raised plastic edges to hold its blades.  Therefore, the steeling or honing object must fit down between the plastic edges.  The steeling glass of the Razor Saver is 1 1/4\\&quot; wide which allows it to fit between the plastic edges where are 1 7/16\\&quot; apart.  You just hold your safety razor and the Razor Saver under running water and run it back and forth 4-5 times at a 45 degree angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steeling a knife is somewhat counterintuitive since you stroke the blade forward into the steeling material; you worry that you may be dulling the blade!.  Knife experts say that you should steel a knife 100 times for every time that you actually grind and sharpen it.  Dulling of a blade is overwhelmingly from bends and nicks in the blade rather than from the blade losing it&#x27;s actual sharpness.  Stropping does the same thing as steeling except that you use a leather strap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;(the art of blade steeling, honing and sharpening): [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative is a leather strop that is 1 1/2\\&quot; wide and does not fit down between the plastic edges of the safety razor.  Perhaps, the strap may bend enough to do so;  however, it is much larger than the Razor Saver but may bring back fonder memories of your barbershop days than a small clean plastic box:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Razor Saver that can be tucked away after use in your medicine cabinet and is cheaper to boot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good idea, but I just can&#x27;t tell if it works. It seems to make only a slight difference.</li>
    <li> How did I not know about these years ago?! This product keeps razors sharp much longer than their lifespan without a sharpener. Saves me so much money on replacement blades! I took one traveling and only took one razor for 4 months and that was all I needed! My only complaint is that the glue holding down the glass/mirror part eventually came apart and the glass finally broke. Had to buy another, but totally worth it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It works just fine. I even picked an old dull blade and it recovered its sharpness. Simple and useful: worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while now and seeing just how long I can stretch out the life of a Fusion cartridge.  This did draw out the life of the blades a bit more, but not as long as I had expected.  It may double the life of a cartridge, but I haven&#x27;t had any results that would lead me to believe that it would last any longer than that.  And yes, I&#x27;ve followed the instructions to the letter.  My razors do seem to get considerably more drag after a little longer than the normal expected lifespan, and I suspect that I&#x27;d probably get some irritation if I wasn&#x27;t using the fantastic shave oil that I switched over to.  On the upside, this is pretty inexpensive and you may get better results using a different razor than I do.</li>
    <li> I have been using the razor saver for over a year.  If you are really careful  you can re-use the disposable razor for months.  You simply dry the razor after use which prevents it from rusting and you run the razor back and forth a few times on the mirror  at a 45 degree angle with water running.  The razor doesn&#x27;t get dull,  it gets sharper.  You can basically keep doing it forever it seems.  Usually I just use the same razor for several months.  It feels good not to be having to throw them away after several uses.  I would say I get an average of 90 days out of one razor.  I like to use the Gillette plus that has two blades.</li>
    <li> having  teenage sons/daughters whom seem to think need  a new razor daily ..its costly so started buying disposables with this razor saver ..&lt;br /&gt;am very pleased ...if you the consumer decide to purchase this ..you&#x27;ll have many years of great use ,excellent savings ...use with confidence ..</li>
    <li> It works but works best with good steal. I use the GM3 and this saver more than doubles the life of my blade. I even makes those dollar store razor blades usable. You got to buy this if you like to save big bucks.</li>
    <li> The price of razor blades is outrageous! I had heard there were a few products out there that could extend the life of the blade. I figured the price was very reasonable to try this product. I am thrilled that it really does work. I use it each time before shaving and have been quite pleased especially considering the condition of the razor I was trying to revive. I would suggest using the blade saver after only a couple of shaves with a new blade so the it never gets a chance to dull. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used to go through razors like nobody&#x27;s business before this thing. I have coarse, dark, thick hair on my legs and this works SO well!! I take it in the shower with me when I am going to shave, and just sharpen before hand. You can do so in between legs/bikini/arm pit etc if you want to keep it really sharp. I hold it flat under the running water, run my razor up and down it around 10 times and that is all you need. My razors last me about 3 months where they used to last me less than two weeks- NO KIDDING. I will say this though, certain blades do not fit in it. I had a Venus womens razor and the head was too wide, so I switched to a mens that didn&#x27;t have all the frills on the sides and it fits perfectly. Disposables fit just fine as well.</li>
    <li> This is the third one I&#x27;ve had over a 12 year period. It works great, is cheaper than the other razor sharpeners out there and will last you a good five to six years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item not really expecting to much, however I am amazed. I visit have been on holiday in USA now for 4 weeks visiting relatives and shaved once a day, this blade shaver has kept the same blade sharp all this time, and has saved me a fortune. I would strongly recommend this item,</li>
    <li> Used it to keep my Pro Glide blades sharp since those blades are so expensive. Works very well.  I just sharpen them for 20 seconds before each shave and then dry the blades thoroughly after each shave and they stay sharp.</li>
    <li> Im not going to lie, I was skeptical about something so simplistic being able to work at all let alone work well.....but I have to give it to this little sharpener! It does in fact do quite a nice job at keeping my razors sharp. I really wish I had discovered this years ago since I have sensitive skin and thick facial hair I could not use a razor more than one time without throwing it away. Since purchasing this product I have been using the same blade going on what will be my 6th time and its still cutting like it was brand new! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who hates throwing away money on blades.</li>
    <li> Do not get hung up or over think this. It really works and saves me a lot of money. Probably saves 150-200 per year.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a really neat gift for my girlfriend&#x27;s dad, who has a big ol&#x27; cueball head.  This device has increased the longevity of all of his (and my) razor blades.  It is a great device to keep the blades clean from excess hair and helps razors give acceptable shaves long after they should have been tossed in the trash.  This has a great ROI and will pay for itself over the lifespan of 2 razor blade 4 packs or 2 bags of disposable razors</li>
    <li> You can definitely tell the difference after passing the blade on the mirror inside about a dozen times.  It doesn&#x27;t get my 4-blade razor sharp as new, but it&#x27;s still pretty close, and sharp enough where it&#x27;d be a waste to throw out.  Should extend the life of every razor by a month or so I&#x27;m hoping.  Will pay for itself quickly, not to mention keep more junk from going to the landfill!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at the beginning but it actually seems to work. I don&#x27;t know if it extends the life of the razor by 20x, but you can definitely get 3~5 extra &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; shaves out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have a mirror inside, and that&#x27;s what seems to realign the blade. Mine fell and the mirror broke. Just be aware of that.</li>
    <li> Using this device will get you 2 or 3 more comfortable shaves than you would otherwise.  I buy good blades so its a good investment.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it works for sure, but I actually think it might. It&#x27;s not miraculous, but that could be because it&#x27;s not the right size to fit my dollar shave club razors correctly and I have to kind of turn them sideways and they may not be making great contact with the steel plate.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with how comfortable each shave is even when a blade cartridge has been used many times.  If it saves you money on blades, so much the better.  Be advised that it does not work on traditional double edge blades--not wide enough. I am into my 4th month of using a Schick Hydro 5 cartridge, which previously lasted 2 weeks if I was lucky.  It has paid for itself already.</li>
    <li> Razor Savor by Sustainable Village:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the \\&quot;Razor Saver\\&quot; straight from manufacture as I figured for the price I can&#x27;t go wrong. I thought it probably wouldn&#x27;t do much or if anything do minimal such as extend the razor one or two more shaves, but I&#x27;d try it anyway. I use Gillette Mach 3 razors. The price of razor blades is not bad especially if you buy your blades at Cosco, but I shave every day to every other day. My blades get worn faster then most shavers because of how I shave. I&#x27;m a 100 percent clean shaver as I work in a public job that requires me to meet professionally face to face with staff, students, and parents. I can&#x27;t look like a bum, and my beard is so dark and thick that one day without shaving would look like two days without shaving to anyone else. I tried wet traditional shaving (single blade razor, puck shaving soap, shaving brush) but I never liked it. I also don&#x27;t have the time in the morning to fool around with all this stuff especially lathering puck shaving soap. I need to shave nice but fast in the morning. Plus, I rather have the modern blade technology so I stick with modern cartridge shaving such as Gillette Mach 3. I bought \\&quot;Razor Saver\\&quot; and tried it on my dull blade, and after using it only once my razor was sharp as day one. Wow! Nice clean shave! I could get three to four weeks out of one razor blade by shaving every other day, but now it looks like I can easily get two months or more and I can shave every day now if I want. For those people with a lesser thick beard they can easily get four to six months added onto their razor blade. The box claims fifty super-sharp shaves per blade. I do not know if \\&quot;Razor Savor\\&quot; works on single blade traditional razors, but it does work nicely on disposable and cartridge razors. I highly recommend it. In fact I&#x27;m buying a second one for future backup. I also would like to state that I do not work for the company so my review is totally unbiased. Five out of five stars.</li>
    <li> For the price, I think it&#x27;s a really nice thing to have.  I don&#x27;t feel like my razor rips up my face anymore after using it just twice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 72, and started shaving back in 1968. At that time, I had a similar device for re honing double edged blades, but found that today&#x27;s multi-plade cartridges are too expensive and have been trying to shave with a $29 electric razor (nice try). Good thing I didn&#x27;t throw away those old razor cartridges because once I purchased this device, and used it, I&#x27;m back on a blade. Thanks for reprising an invention from the far past.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first. But I keep going on this one blade with the sharpener. Weeks now! It&#x27;s awesome. Blades are getting so expensive with these multi-blade arrangements, and I didn&#x27;t want to go to electric which also requires replacement parts. My feeling is shaving should be cheap and these guys have done it. I didn&#x27;t know if it would work for a multi-blade but it does. And I shave after my shower with just water so that&#x27;s all the more impressive.</li>
    <li> Does not seam to work</li>
    <li> While I can&#x27;t say if it actually helps with sharpening, I will comment that it does not fit fancy razor heads AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Venus embrace or mens multi blade heads with moisture strips I should have asked more people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what does fit size wise? think of the simple disposable razors. If your blade heads are about that size then it will fit.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Better than the battery operated type by far!  Makes my Quattro blades last and last and last and last...</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first. Decided for the price, what&#x27;s the worst that would happen. It worked perfect. No complaints. Highly recommend to anyone. Good quality. Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my dad and one for myself.  It works as described--a pleasant experience!  I wish I had found this earlier.  I am recommending to all my friends!</li>
    <li> This product really works!  I&#x27;m already at about 3 months on the same disposable blade, that I used to replace every other week.  Just need to &amp;#34;sharpen&amp;#34; every week.</li>
    <li> Works perfect use it about once a month makes my blades last 3 times as long. best razor sharpener for very cheap</li>
    <li> I have used it a couple of times and it seems to work very good It appears that it does sharpen or clean the blades as stated. The blade seems to stay sharp longer.</li>
    <li> I used this sharpener with both my husband&#x27;s razor and my razor. It worked perfectly with his Gillette Mach 3 razor, but with my own women&#x27;s Gillette Sensor Excel, the very wide handle could not fit into the groove. I ended up having to pop out the cartridge and use a pair of pliers to hold it in order to sharpen it, which was a hassle but worked fine. I found that the instruction sheet that came with the item a little lacking, though. I&#x27;m still not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to push AND pull, or if this will undo the sharpening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read through the reviews here before purchasing, and one concern was that the unit is fragile and can break when dropped, especially when used in a wet environment. Thus, I added shock-resistant bumpers all over mine with Sugru, which also helps it grip the counter when I use it. I haven&#x27;t had this item for very long and have only used it twice, but so far, it works as promised. Will update in the future with more use.</li>
    <li> It was very effective at maintaining a sharp blade.  The only issue was I switched from the Mach 3 to Dorco razors and they didn&#x27;t fit the opening.  I tried popping to top off and ended up shattering the glass.  It is probably designed with that opening to reduce movement and thus produce a sharper blade; however, I&#x27;d need an open faced or larger opening design to reorder as long as as use Dorco razor which have a larger handle and broader head.</li>
    <li> Makes a noticeable difference on worn blades for my 4-blade Shick Quattro.  Like brand new?  No, but it helps blades go months longer then normal.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my wife, so she could use it to maintain some of those expensive, multi-blade razors they like to sell these days. She was so taken with it she wants to buy them for everyone in the family!</li>
    <li> The razor saver works as good as advertised. There&#x27;s really not much to say - it&#x27;s priced right and it works great. It will extend the life of your razor cartridges incredibly.</li>
    <li> Saves me a ton in razors! Seems to reduce nicks as well. I use it to sharpen Mach 3 razors, and I definitely get 30+ good uses for each razor.&lt;br /&gt;Would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item several months ago and even after reading all of the positive reviews I was still skeptical but after owning this sharpener now for around six months or so I am only on my second set of razor blades!!  I cannot imagine how much money this thing will save me over the years.  I use the Schick Hydro and the head is almost too big to fit in the razor saver but if you hold it just right you can use it.  Again, I am only on my second set of blades in around six months!!  This thing works for me and for my wife who uses for her razor as well.  Spend a couple bucks on this and save lots of $$$$$$$$!!</li>
    <li> It certainly DOES sharpen blades...I was quite impressed with that.  However, the manufacturing process left a pointy protrusion inside the sharpener that catches on the blade each time it goes back and forth, which makes it a little tricky to use, especially with wet hands.  The first time I dropped it, it broke apart and the glass sharpening plate came out (I was curious what the material was, but didn&#x27;t want to find out that way).  The 2nd time I dropped it, the glass plate broke, so it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> Would not buy this product. It is just a piece of mirror stuck on plastic. After using it for 2 months the glass broke.</li>
    <li> Really works!  My husband loves the fact he can shave longer with one blade!</li>
    <li> Had to run water while sharpening razors at a certain degree. Def. not user friendly and not happy with the design.  Cannot tell the difference easily either.</li>
    <li> Using this with ladies shavers.  It took a bit to get the technique down but it works.</li>
    <li> Great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best purchase since the Tower 200.</li>
    <li> In addition to shaving a heavy beard every day, I shave my head 3X per week, and you can&#x27;t do that without a sharp blade.  This item doesn&#x27;t look like much, but it works wonderfully.  You put it under water, and pull your blade back and fourth 10 times, holding the blade at a 45 degree angle.  I estimate my disposable razors are lasting me about 6 times as long as they were before I bought this.  The saving really add up.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t perceive a noticeable difference to the sharpness of blades after using the product.  They are only marginally sharper and don&#x27;t hold the edge long.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is the best blade sharpener out there. I shave 3-4 times a week, and I regularly get three months&#x27; use out of one Gillette Mach 3 blade -- after sharpening the blade, whether you do it every time you shave or once a week, it&#x27;s like having a brand-new razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting three months&#x27; worth of shaving out of one blade means that, when I have to pay $40 for 15 blades, I&#x27;m getting almost four years of shaving, and that it is a much less painful purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the RazorPit sharpener as well, and the Razor Saver is so much more effective, not to mention easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your wallet a favor. Do the planet a favor. Do your face (or legs, or armpits, or back, or head, or whatever else you shave) a favor: buy the Razor Saver.</li>
    <li> A few reviewers did comparisons. I didn&#x27;t need to because of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the saver on disposables and also on my Mach with&lt;br /&gt;good effect. The blades do have more life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $3 a razor blade (outrageous!) isn&#x27;t the saver worth trying?&lt;br /&gt;I say yep.</li>
    <li> I decided to start shaving my head again so I knew I would need a razor sharpener as the blade is usually dull after 3-4 shaves. I chose the razor saver because it had good reviews and it was cheap. I had a razor that hadn&#x27;t been used in almost a year and after using the razor saver it was sharper than it was when new. I have very sensitive skin but since using this product razor burn has been greatly reduced. This is a must have for anyone using disposable razors. Saves a lot of money and a lot of trash from entering landfills which should be everyone&#x27;s concern.</li>
    <li> I have used this on two Schick quatro for women razors and it works well. It is simple enough to use. They felt like using brand new razors and no razor burn. This will definitely reduce waste and also save you money on those expensive refill cartridges. What a great idea.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military so shaving is a daily requirement. Using old razors has been a toll on my face while continuing to buy new ones has been a big drain on my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;To truly put this product to the test I took an older razor I had been using and resharpened it in order to compare the results.  While of course the gel padding on the razor (I use gillete proglide) is gone I believe I had a shave as close and as sharp as any I had had previously. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have always dried off my razor blades after each use which seemed  to help. I didn&#x27;t really believe this thing  would work but I thought for this price I would be out very little and I would write a nasty review letting the world know what junk this really is. In fact at first I thought maybe the manufacturer was writing all these good reviews but to my surprise I&#x27;m getting the closes shaves I have ever had, this thing really does work !!!!!</li>
    <li> Save Ur Hard-Earned $$$ and Reuse Ur Disposable Razors w/this Handy-Dandy Razor Saver/Sharpener...Anyone who uses disposable razors should have one!!!-)</li>
    <li> Works great!!!! Just wish there was a wider version for wider razors (women&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> I have to shave pretty frequently, so I was going through disposable razors pretty quickly as as a result. I was worrying about the cost of all this,so I decided to try to buy a razor saver. And what do you know ,it actually works! If you sharpen it long enough (I do it for about a minute), its about as sharp as it is new, or close to it anyway. I don&#x27;t get cut when I use the re-sharpened ones though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good way to use less razors (and to save some money)!</li>
    <li> It helps to keep the blades sharp!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had one for years, maybe 5?, and I finally broke it. Both my husband and I use the disposable Mach III blades...same razor for his face AND my legs plus other bits.  This tool has saved us much money over the years. Probably get 2 to 3 months per blade. Not lying.&lt;br /&gt;Store in shower so the water drains off and it dries. The mirror came unglued awhile ago and we didn&#x27;t reglue. Still used it. I just dropped it in the shower while cleaning the walls. Mirror broke but did not shatter.  Useful to know if you are showering. Just handle carefully and it will serve you well. Just ordered a new one....</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really sound anything. Doesn&#x27;t really matter though, as I only shave my head once every two weeks. It wasn&#x27;t much. Seems more of a novelty to me than a practical buy.</li>
    <li> I guess it worked pretty well while I had it.  I had it less than a month.  Unfortunately, after having the product it fell inside the shower and broke. Its not like I had on top of the shower stall either. It was on the side of the tub and fell only a 1 1/2 feet. Maybe it can be glued back, but it disturbs me that it was so easily broken.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I first used the product because I was expecting &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; while sharpening my dual blade razor. The type of drag you&#x27;d expect from a knife blade on a stone. There was none. However as a test I dragged the blade over my face before sharpening and again after sharpening. The blades were dull before and sharp after; that&#x27;s all the proof I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, will probably pat for itself in 6 months. BTW, I also use an old toothbrush to get the dried shaving cream out from between the blades. Works good and sharpening afterward extends the blade&#x27;s life. Maybe they should include this with the sharpener as a kit.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to re-sharpen the blades at all.</li>
    <li> I have tried different angles and different amounts of water I don&#x27;t see where this does anything.  I might as well just slide my razor over a thin strip of aluminum foil.  I could have just bought another 4 pack of Gillette Fusion blades for what I spent on this.  Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work with multiblade cartridges because that is all I tried to use and that is why I gave it two stars instead of one.</li>
    <li> Had this item for a few weeks now and still on my first blade. And still sharp as ever. Im currently using the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide, and these blade refills are expensive. I mean like $30 for a pack of 6 or so.  I have to shave everyday since my job requires it, and each blade would last roughly 10 shaves before becoming completely dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since using the razor saver, i have been through about 20 shaves in, and i run my blade through the Razor Saver every 2-3 uses. This has been keeping my blade fresh and sharp, and i am loving it! Thank you for such a great product, i never knew ever existed until now. I will be recommending this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I was / am not doing it right? I don&#x27;t see the results as advertised. Also the opening to place the blade / shaving handle is too tight and cannot be sure the razors are at 45 degree angle. The price was low enough not to care if it works or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/17/13  I have gotten better at sharpening my shaving blades. It seems fine now. Perhaps my expectations were higher than the original results.</li>
    <li> a piece of glass in a plastic case, pretty simple. It does work quite well though so its probably worth it. .</li>
    <li> So far my razor blade seems to be as sharp as new. This was a new blade that I have used a total of six times .</li>
</ol>
