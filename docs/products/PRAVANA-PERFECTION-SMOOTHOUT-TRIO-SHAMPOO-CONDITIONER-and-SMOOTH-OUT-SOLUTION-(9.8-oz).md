      <li>I am excited and will buy it again</li>
      <li>Since I can&#x27;t live with the wild curls and need a product that won&#x27;t damage my fine hair or me or a stylist&#x27;s health, this product has been great.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After using this product I notice a big difference however I found a finger nail in the conditioner. It also didn&#x27;t come with the mask but conditioner instead. When my hair is wet it smells like a meat shop with something rotten!!</li>
    <li> I should have read more thoroughly this is a touch up set.  Wished the seller stated it. Even some of the beauticians stated this&lt;br /&gt;and include a set of instructions. They didn&#x27;t care for this one either.</li>
    <li> This product was great, easy to apply, and made my hair extra shiny and soft. The only downside is that the actual product was a little watery/runny. Other than that I totally recommend this!</li>
    <li> This product gave my wife excellent results.  Her hair is silky and smooth with lots of bounce. She was considering a keratin treatment but really glad she tried this product first! Shipper provided excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It left my curly and frizzy hair smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and it is very upsetting to see professional products like this sold to non licensed individuals! I worked my butt off for my license and these products are intended for professional use only! What consumers do not understand is purchasing these products from anywhere other than their salon licensed professional is leaviing them at risk! These products are not guaranteed! Who knows where or why they are available to the general public! Only products sold to and used by licensed cosmetologists are guaranteed safe and legit! Erks me up no end! You could be purchasing something out of date and all your hair fall out!</li>
    <li> DO NOT EVER USE OR BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! IT WILL RUIN YOUR HAIR! My hair is breaking off and completely singed and so fuzzy/frizzy I cannot even comb it!!! My hair is totally fried. All the stylist said was she was willing to do a &amp;#34;Free Trim&amp;#34;! Seriously? My hair is ruined! This has me posting as my husband but I had it done on my long, beautiful blonde hair which is now FRIED!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Easy to apply and made my hair super smooth and shiny. The only downside is that it only last for 6 wks instead of 8-12 wks.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected! Delivered on time. Absolutely love this product and so glad I could do it at home</li>
    <li> My mom did this treatment and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Great job. I have long, thick, curly hair. The small bottle was just enough. Works really well for me. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good product excellent price</li>
    <li> Great product! Received it right away! Will order again!</li>
    <li> Takes many steps and lots of time to apply. Doesn&#x27;t work very well on my wavy hair. Overall really disappointed</li>
    <li> I am a stylist and have been fighting my hair my entire life. Its super curly and FRIZZY, but somewhat fine at the same time.  I always straighten it. I just got done doing the pravana perfection treatment and OMG, this product is going to be life changing for me. I literally blow dried it with my fingers afterwards and it is unbelievable. The texture is completely different, Ive never in my life had shiny hair without a flat iron. Im in complete shock over this product. Just ordered 2 more boxes. One box Is  enough for 2 treatments for my hair. Just make sure you follow the directions very closely. I also combed my hair the whole time the solution was on (you can do this for extra curl reduction).</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t recommend this product because I was under the impression that my hair would be straightened for 6 months and after a week is already getting weavy. Just a waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> Much better than Brazilian Blowout for me.  No smell, no eye burning, no scalp irritation.  Hair extremely silky and soft. Kept ability to style any way I want.  Has lasted 12 weeks.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the results. My hair is smooth and soft without a dry over processed feeling.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Product works great. I was deliver fast, I would buy this product again.Excellent packing.I purchased this same product before at store and notice the quantity was slightly less.</li>
    <li> Had it done by a salon in GA and loved it!! My hair is very frizzy and wavy but baby fine and I kept the curl and some volume but lost all the frizz. I had stopped doing the keratin treatment for health reasons.  I cannot seem to find a salon her in MA who does the Pravana Perfection so have purchased the product online and will give it a go at home.  Wish me luck!</li>
    <li> I have crazy frizzy miserable hair- until Pravana. I had my sister apply the treatment at home and it worked just as well as it did after my hair dresser applied it a few months ago. The cost at the salon was $225 so clearly buying it on Amazon is the way I&#x27;ll be going from now on. The process takes about 2-2.5 hours. And for me it lasts about 6 weeks. I know it would be longer if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair everyday but I workout daily so I have to wash out the sweat/salt.</li>
    <li> It is chemical base it burns, and left my scalp with scabs and hair shaft weak and splitting. Do not buy!  I reported it to Pravana.  The real Pravana is excellent,  left my hair healthy and did not burn or smell.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, it didn&#x27;t work on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to use it and my hair didn&#x27;t get any better:(</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy, coarse hair. I was really excited about this considering I was spending $200+ on the Brazilian blowout (which really worked for me), but was extremely disappointed with Pravana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and watched the YouTube video. Not only did it not work, it made my hair reek for a month, really just smell awful. I won&#x27;t be trying this again.</li>
    <li> Try it! You&#x27;ll really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to follow all steps. your hair will look amazing.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for hair I used, I love when I putted in my hair is beautiful, shine  and  straight without slings. Excellent.</li>
    <li> Professional results! Will never pay 250.00 in shop again! Really good product... Minimal odor, easy application. Did strip color from hair though, next time will apply color  or glaze after Pravana keritin as per instructions.</li>
    <li> Pravana Perfection Smoothout Trio are the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used.  In the last 10 years, my fine &amp; thin hair has become curly.  It&#x27;s pretty, as long as wind speeds are at 0 mph (so almost never).  The bathroom cabinet is full of curl and straightening products that just don&#x27;t cut it.  Since I can&#x27;t live with the wild curls and need a product that won&#x27;t damage my fine hair or me or a stylist&#x27;s health, this product has been great.  My hair is smooth, and if I blow it out straight it stays that way.  Interestingly, I could let it air dry and still have curls, but haven&#x27;t done that because I love that it&#x27;s straight.  I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair completely down for the first time in a long while.  THANK YOU!  One last note: using the shampoo and especially the conditioner is important to maintain results for a longer time.</li>
    <li> Even though I did not buy this from Amazon, I wanted to write a review. My stylist suggested this smoothing treatment bc my hair is wavy and gets very frizzy. I love that you don&#x27;t have to wait 3 days to shampoo your hair. No harsh chemical smell either. My hair is much smoother and my drying time has been cut in half.</li>
    <li> I will never pay a stylist to do this again. It was easy and the instructions were clear. My hair looks better and feels softer than the salon. It is healthy and no more split ends. I am excited and will buy it again</li>
    <li> Product worked as well as it did when I had the service done professionally -- for a third of the price!</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what I wanted it to do. My naturally curly/frizzy hair is tamed but not straight. It feels soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve used other smoothing treatments in the past that caused my hair to be dry and brittle. This one did the opposite.</li>
    <li> At 50+ I have been to salons galore and have tried a multitude of products to rid my head of frizzy, unruly and untamed hair. The only product I have ever used was the Pravana SmoothOut perfection trio, smoothout solution. It is the bomb and I am living testimony to it. Awesome job Pravana! ********* Ten star rating!</li>
    <li> relaxes my hair very well. Just didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I have long, dry, frizzy hair, that is so awful I was considering having it cut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really course, unmanageable hair, that has become worse and worse over time. I used the formaldehyde straighteners in the past, and they helped, they made my straight, but still really dry and course. When it grew out the hair was damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this product to my hairdresser over 5 weeks ago. SHE AND ANOTHER HAIRDRESSER applied the product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is SO important to have someone who is knowledgeable apply the products to your hair. You CANNOT do it yourself, and even with a friend - you won&#x27;t get the results you deserve - you need a knowledgeable hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was over 5 weeks ago. My hair is still soft, shiny, smooth and silky. UNBELIEVABLE!! I just wash it with Pravana shampoo and use Pravana conditioner, blow dry, and use the flat iron for 5 minutes. I wish I could include a picture - I have never had soft, shiny hair in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE never change or discontinue this product. Let me know ahead of time so I can buy 20 boxes...</li>
    <li> ..... at a salon 2 weeks ago for $150.00 (I asked for a senior discount!)and I love it.  I did a lot of research on this vs. the Brazilian blow-out and Pravana wins hands down.  I can see why the salon service is recommended:  the final step in the process is flat ironing to seal the product to the hair cuticle.  Since I have a big ol&#x27; head of thick hair (used to have an Angela Davis &#x27;fro back in the day!) TWO stylists were wielding flat irons and I just don&#x27;t think I could have managed that at home.  But.... since I&#x27;ve had the salon service and have copious research notes I&#x27;d be willing to enlist the help of 2 friends and an extra flat iron to do the next one at home and save some $$$$.&lt;br /&gt;BTW: no breakage, hair loss or damage has occurred.  I am using sulfate- and sodium-free products (some by Pravana)to extend the life of the Smooth-Out.  My hair is soft, straight and shiniest with the flat iron; curls well with a hot curling brush if I want a curlier look.&lt;br /&gt;So.... if you have stylist or well-trusted friends try it at home.  Just be sure to follow the directions.</li>
    <li> Excellent products and results.</li>
    <li> I had the perfection smoothing treatment done to my hair in may.  I have wavy hair that can be frizzy when blow dried so I have to smooth it with a round brush.  I wanted to be able to blow it dry with less frizz.  Everything was fine at first then I started noticing my hair falling out constantly, not just in the shower.  I went to the doctor, had tests run, everything was fine.  Then I started wondering if it was the pravana treatment.  After what I have read about other people&#x27;s experiences, I believe that&#x27;s what caused it.  I have also read some people that say it permanently changed their hair texture which makes me so sad because I used to be able to spiral my hair on a curling iron and it took curl so well, now it barely takes the curl.  It has thinned so much you can see my scalp.  I just want my old hair back but I don&#x27;t know if it will never happen.  Be careful and do your research.  If you Google &amp;#34;keratin treatments caused hair thinning&amp;#34; you will see many forums where people post similar experiences to mine.  I read all the good reviews on amazon and thought it would be fine.  I wish I had done more research before I had this done.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use and straightens really well. Lasts 2 months.</li>
    <li> I am a retired Hair dresser .. And I have used Both  ( Agave ) and now  ( Pravana )Smooth-out on my grand daughter ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to let people know what I have found , They both do about the same but the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agave straightens the hair more ... After the Pravana I still flat ironed her hair  a little&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where with the Agave after Blow Drying I didn&#x27;t have to flat iron .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grand Daughter is mixed and likes her hair Straight so we will be using the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agave Blow out from now on ... Both leave the hair in good condition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we just want the more straightening affect.</li>
    <li> ITS AMAZING MAKE YOUR HAIR SOFT SHINY WITH LITTLE CURLY,&lt;br /&gt;GO FORWAED AND BUY IT ITS WORTH IT.JUST READ INSTRCTION CARFULY&lt;br /&gt;AND THAT&#x27;S IT.</li>
    <li> I tried this at a salon. Not sure of all the great reviews but I have quite curly and firzzy hair and it definitely did not straighten my hair. it does look like the volume of my hair reduced greatly . but i dont like the feel of my hair after straightening it. it did not reduce my styling time at all.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing better is , if I want to leave my hair curly its a bit more controlled. please try with very low expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of disappointed. hopefully it will not cause any further damage to my hair like hair fall etc.</li>
    <li> I returned this after I found out that this can damage your hair from my stylist. She recommended against it even though she performs the treatment, just not for MY hair, it is sensitive to heat and should only have one pass of the flat iron. I think you need to flat iron your hair a few times with this</li>
    <li> Wonderful product works great</li>
    <li> Awesome product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Easy to apply but make sure you follow directions.  LOVE it, love it, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hair is smooth, soft and seems healthier after application.  Sticky is YUCK, but once you wash it out you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to use this at first. It&#x27;s offered at the salon I go to, only they charge $90 for each treatment. The first time I used it, it was very difficult to do on myself and I wish I&#x27;d had someone help me. It&#x27;s hard to get the back of your hair. The results on my super curly hair- amazing! I am able to blow dry my hair without a brush, just pulling it straight with my fingers. I then run either a flat iron or my InStyler over it to smooth, and I&#x27;m ready to go. It used to take me nearly 2 hours to straighten my long hair, now I can do it in about 15 or less. What it doesn&#x27;t do- take all of the curl out (it just relaxes it a whole lot). What it does do- leave your hair softer, shinier, and much easier to style.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I did buy Pravana and I bought the Bio Ionic Agave smoothing treatment.  I put the Pravavna on my 17 year old daughter and I put the Bio Ionic Agave on my hair.  Here&#x27;s the comparison:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pravana - much more liquidy and the smell and smoke was intense!  I agree with xoxonikki, you should do this outside if you can!  Anyway, my daughter&#x27;s hair came out fabulous!  Her hair was breaking like crazy from the Chi that was on her hair before so we were trying to find something to stop the breakage... Ok, so we put the pravana on it, her hair is completely straight and it is shiny and NO BREAKAGE since we put it on her hair.  It is a great product, easy to do at home and I highly recommend it.  Her hair falls to the bottom of her neck so one bottle was plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bio Ionic Agave Smoothing treatment - So I had this treatment a week ago.  It was a thicker consistency than the Pravana.  It did slightly burn when she first started putting it on me, I&#x27;m not sure why.  So here&#x27;s the important thing... My hair is down to my shoulder blades, we ran out of the smoothing solution very quickly and had to use it very sparingly.  I should&#x27;ve ordered 2 kits but live and learn.  The smell was not bad at all, it sort of smelled like cocoa butter.  There was minimal smoke coming off of the iron.  After shampooing and blow drying this was the results:  My hair color was lifted from a medium brown to light brown.  I thought it was odd it would lift my color so much but hey, I kind of like it : ) My hair is extremely straight and my ends were a little fried (they were probably already a little crunchy but this really sent them over the edge).  I went today and had my hair trimmed.  After my stylist was done trimming it she blow dried it and did not have to flat iron it!  Amazing!  I am very pleased with the Agave.  So next go round, I&#x27;m going to try the Pravana and then use the Agave on my daughter.  We will see if either of us notices a huge difference. (I am mixed caucasian and african american - hair is more african american coarse than the mixed curly hair and my daughter is african american - mostly, we have 2 very different textures of hair.</li>
    <li> This product has helped me eliminate fizz, but also makes my hair feel thicker and much softer than it ever has before. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> This actually works.  It is wonderful. I have thick, frizzy, curly hair that usually takes 35 minutes to blow dry. Now it takes less than 10 and does not curl up or become frizzy in the first hour. I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> It worked really well</li>
    <li> The first few days it seemed like it worked, but my hair is just as curly as before. However, I do live in Miami...</li>
    <li> This is perfect smooth out for my coarse and color treated hair. Little odor and easy to apply. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product introduces you to curly hair that you will love. It doesn&#x27;t take the curl out but makes it super easy to blow dry straight or keep hair curly without the frizz! Drying time is cut in half. Bottom line is that it makes stubborn hair more manageable. This is a great kit if you want to try it out for the first time... Otherwise, buy the larger Smoothout bottle and use any sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. Lasts about 4 weeks if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday.</li>
    <li> I love the pravana perfection smoothing treatment. I&#x27;m a licensed cosmologist in MD. I Used to perform various keratins. But the amount of formaldehyde and other possible carcinogens is a turn off. With the PST you don&#x27;t have to wait before shampooing. However this is a testament that should only be performed by a stylist. And should not be purchased through any online website. Product could be tampered with. How do you know you aren&#x27;t paying $60 for some nair...</li>
    <li> I love it I don&#x27;t think I can live without it my hair is smooth and less frizzy and it doesn&#x27;t damaged the hair</li>
