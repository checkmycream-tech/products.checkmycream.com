<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Reasonably priced (200 sheets for ~$8), great size for purses, great for blotting oily faces.  What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Love these! My boyfriend misplaced them when I first got these and then he told me where he put them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that aside these being lost, since found they&#x27;ve been amazing and I love them</li>
    <li> I have such a oily face all the time so I was looking for the perfect solution and I found it for the right price a++++</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. These are nice papers without any of the extras. 100% Natural Fiber and that is it! I use them mostly on my forehead because that is always shiny, and my nose. You get a bunch of them and they are perfect for purse or pocket.</li>
    <li> Love these. They come in a small discrete package with 100 sheets. Perfect for those times your skin is a bit oily while you are out. My daughter even likes them!</li>
    <li> I use blotting paper all the time! Keeps my makeup fresh looking and I can put these in my purse instead of loads of makeup. This brand has a nice feeling paper and I only have to use 1 at a time. Other brands I&#x27;ve used are too small and I use 2 or 3. I will buy these again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I love these as much as I hate my oily face.  They are convenient to carry in my purse and work very well when my face starts looking shiny.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of blotting papers - but always so hesitant to purchase because they go so fast. Small count packages for insane amounts of money have never been considered a worthwhile purchase for me. I was so impressed with these papers! They work better than other brands I have tried and they don&#x27;t smudge your makeup at all. I loved the 2 pack deal too! I will absolutely purchase these again when I run out. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> If you love being photographed, blot with this first. It takes all the grease and oil and shine away leaving a gorgeous matte finish. I love this so much I have one in my car and purse!</li>
    <li> These little papers are fantastic! My daughter and I both keep a pack in our purses to blot during the day. Compact, quick, easy and leaves my skin feeling oil-free!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with these blotting sheets. I have extremely oily skin so I though maybe they would help. They seemed to help a little but I had to use several sheets to make a difference. They are, however, very portable and easy to put in my purse.</li>
    <li> These sheets don&#x27;t seem to absorb as much oil as others I have used.  They are ok, but nothing more.  I will use them but will not order them again.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and it was well received. They work great and will be purchasing more of them.</li>
    <li> These were okay. They worked somewhat but weren&#x27;t the best product I have ever used. I do not think I would recommend spending any significant amount of money on these.</li>
    <li> With this set, you get 200 blotting sheets. They are kind of hard to get out of the packaging. I couldn&#x27;t just get one out at a time. You can see the amount of oil that comes off your face because the sheets become see through. I could feel a difference of the oil on my face after using the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free in order to give my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Good deal for face blotting paper. My skin tends to get oily by mid day and these are perfect for clearing that up. These help me make my face feel and look fresh again. They also work well even if you have makeup on. Since it comes with 2 packs of 100 sheets, I keep one pack in my makeup bag and the other at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> get the products in a fast period. good for summer time cuz i am oil type skin. the most part i like is the product does not have &#x27;perfume&#x27; kind odor which i dont like at all.</li>
    <li> I used to use blotting papers in my 20&#x27;s but stopped.  Now in my late 30&#x27;s I find I need to use them again.  This brand took care of the oil on my face and didn&#x27;t smear my makeup.  They make touching up your makeup easy and a snap! And it&#x27;s a really great deal to get 2 packs in package.  I can keep one in my purse and one with my makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one pack in the office and one pack in my purse to ensure being able to use them when they&#x27;re needed - Maybe it&#x27;s because my skin is dryer this time of year or that I&#x27;m not cognizant of periods of the day/week/month when my skin has more natural oils but I haven&#x27;t experienced dirty or damp wipes.  I will continue to use the product before pictures and absolutely when I want to &amp;#34;freshen&amp;#34; up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also looking forward to warmer temperatures so that I can get greater use of them!</li>
    <li> My son has an oily face and loves this! Great quality wipes...A+</li>
    <li> Blotting papers are a must for me. I have oily skin, and even though I use matte makeup, I still end to shine. These blotting papers are much cheaper than other ones I have used, but they work just as well. They are made from a different material, actual paper instead of the rubbery plastic stuff that other blotting sheets are made from. The only thing I would change is that I would like to see some sticky tape on the inside that grabs the next sheet for you, it is a little pain to get one individual sheet. That is just my personal preference though. These were a great deal, and are something I will keep in my purse, and probably buy once I run out.</li>
    <li> These are great to use on the run when you are having an oily day you can pull the blotting papers out of your purse and blot your face to remove the oily residue that can cause a break out later. I received 2 packs and shared one with my daughter who has very oily skin, She thinks they are great as well and plans to keep using them.</li>
    <li> I got these for my friend&#x27;s teenage daughters and they love them.  The wipes keeps their faces oil free and fresh.</li>
    <li> The Day by Day Beauty Luxury Blotting Papers come in a set of 100, making them super convenient and totally economical. Most days I use just one (or less), so these are sure to last me a long time. They’re cruelty-free, which is an awesome selling point to me, especially since I’ve been toying with the idea of going totally cruelty-free lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sheets themselves are pretty thin, but not so thin that they tear when you pull them out. They’re soft and comfortable to use, and are also surprisingly powerful. I notice that I get oily around midday, predictably right around my T-zone and these sheets work like magic at mattifying and refreshing my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On top of working really well, I think the packaging is super cute! When you open it up, you’re greeted with “Hello, beautiful,” something I definitely don’t mind reading. It’s also nice and sturdy, something some of the other blotting papers I’ve tried has severely lacked. Even the more expensive papers I’ve used have torn apart after a few uses or never really secured completely. The Day by Day Beauty papers haven’t seen that issue at all, yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like these and would definitely repurchase. I do feel like some of my makeup came off on the paper in addition to excess sebum, something that might be a concern if you’re concerned with your makeup staying perfect. I didn’t feel like it was enough to notice on my face, but I definitely saw a bit of product on the paper. I also wish that like my Palladio blotting sheets these ones came with a bit of powder on either side, just because on hot summer days I can totally see myself going through several of these to get the desired matte effect. Those suggestions aside, I found them to be totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> My blotting sheets were packaged well. No damage.&lt;br /&gt;When I use the blotting papers, they work really well. I&#x27;m amazed at the oil that comes off my face. I look as refreshed as If I had just woken up after using them.  My only complaint is that when I pull the sheets out of the box, if I am not careful enough, they tear. Great value, great product.</li>
    <li> These work amazing. I had just got done applying my makeup when I noticed my oily my nose and cheeks looked, after using these I realized it had not affected my makeup but yet got all the oil off!! Also my boyfriend who has oily skin talks about how quick and easy they are to use.</li>
    <li> Very small and easy to carry. These are probably the best blotting sheets Ive used and I have tried them all. These are very lightweight, and easy to carry around. Heck, they get 100 of them in one small package. These are good to have in the car to get rid of excess oil or in your purse to use when &amp;#34;freshening up&amp;#34;. I spend a lot of time on camera so these are the bomb! Will buy again. Thanks</li>
    <li> When I wake up in the morning, my nose is really oily. Sometimes it&#x27;ll get oily throughout the day, but who cares about that. The sheets work as they should; oil is removed once used. Since I don&#x27;t really have that much of an oily face except my nose area, I only have to use 1 sheet.  Removes Oil; Fits In Purse; Inexpensive. I will def recommend this product to my family an friends.</li>
    <li> These blotting sheets did a great job at absorbing excess oil without messing up my make up. They are made with thicker paper than some I&#x27;ve used in the past, so they are easier to use and don&#x27;t rip. They are great to keep in your purse or handbag to use throughout the day. You also really can&#x27;t beat the price considering you get 200 total sheets!  I would recommend these to anyone who wants to control excess shine and oil at a great price. I received these for review, however all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Loved!  These work great for oily skin without taking makeup off!</li>
    <li> This is a great product to have if you have trouble blotting and makeup coming off too. Easy to place in the purse when having a busy day.Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This helps me so much get rid of the extra oil before i apply makeup I&#x27;m so glad i received  this product.It works amazing leaves my face oil free</li>
    <li> Who likes to have an oily face, especially after lunch? Exactly! But you can&#x27;t run home to fix your face, so what&#x27;s a woman to do? Try the Luxury Blotting Paper pack from Day by Day Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cute little package that fits easy into your pocket, purse or briefcase. It&#x27;s amazing that it&#x27;s so slim but holds 100 sheets of blotting paper! When you find your face getting a little shiny, you open the envelope and slip out a small piece of paper and lightly blot it on the shiny spots. It absorbs the extra oil and leaves your skin looking fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wearing makeup? That&#x27;s fine, it leaves it in place; just remember to blot, not rub. And since there&#x27;s 100 in the pack, you have plenty to share with your girlfriends when they see just how handy these babies are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that I needed them most on my nose and chin area once or twice a day. But another friend of mine used them mostly on her forehead, so they really work wherever you need them the most. And it doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind since it&#x27;s powder free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blotting Paper: #1 Best Blotting Paper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always Your Freshest Face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Blotting Paper Perfection.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried ordinary blotting tissues before, you&#x27;ll notice the premium feel &amp; satisfying clean feel with Day by Day Beauty&#x27;s #1 Blotting Papers right away.

    <li> These are great! They get all the oil off, and I get super oily in my T zone.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have try blotting paper. I like that they come in a compact pack to make it easy to carry with me. They worked great at removing the oil from my skin and I love that my skin does not look oily. I would say if you want blotting paper, these definitely will be a great choice.</li>
    <li> I received these today, and I was very happy, my face was shiny from mommy duties all day. I used one to blot my face, wala, no more shiny face. I love these and would order more. Great product</li>
    <li> These are just okay.  They do work decently, alhtough, I could go to the store and buy tissue paper and cut it into small rectangles and it would basically be the same as these.</li>
    <li> I clean who it clears the oily skin..</li>
    <li> Great did what it was suppose to do</li>
    <li> How I ever lived with these blotting sheets that I received FREE from Amazing Deals Group I dont know. They are easy to use and take with you wherever you go. A nice paper case to keep the sheets clean and dry. Never worry about oil shine on your face again. Or smudged make up. Cant believe how awesome this product is.</li>
    <li> i really liked these because there small and you can carry them in your pocket or purse, i like that they are moistured and not dry like most, i like that it takes all the dirt off your face when you use it, they dont leave blotches on your face it removes everything,they do the job you want them to do i would really recommend this product to my family and friends...</li>
    <li> It comes with two sets per package which is very convenient.  I keep one in my car and one in my desk at work. My face gets extremely oily during the day, especially on stressful days.  These little sheets were able to absorb the oil without removing my make up. The sheets are also bigger than other oil blotting sheets I have purchased in the past.  Other brands I would have to use 2 sheets, with Day By Day I only had to use one sheet for my entire face.</li>
    <li> good blotting paper~!!&lt;br /&gt;With a nose as shiny as mine, a good pressed powder has always been my faithful go-to beauty product for helping conceal my glow-on-the-go (a nice way of saying, my super sweaty face). However, it would be good to find a more compact, less bulky alternative that would be able to fit in one of my impractically small ‘going out out’ handbags and thankfully, I think I’ve found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“These blotting papers were excellent at mopping up all excess oil from my T-zone which come 5pm, was shining like a light bulb. Portable, sleek and discreet, the only thing that I could fault is that I found it a little fiddly to get the papers out one at a time. That being said, it was fine once I’d got the knack of it. I have a feeling that these will become my new must-have clubbing companion on many a night out to come.”</li>
    <li> Very nice product, Arrived on time. These blotting sheets really come in handy whenever I need a quick fix of makeup or want to clean my face. They are smooth and comfortable, and just the right size. Loving it so far!</li>
    <li> I received my Blotting Paper Face and I can&#x27;t say enough how satisfied I am with the product. Because of my work I have to wear makeup daily (Im a model-actress) and instead of reapplying or doing touch ups I just have to use my blotting sheet every time I feel my face is greasy, the results are extraordinaire, I am so happy I found this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received it quickly and it was well packaged. I was a really good size to put in my purse or even in my wallet. Even thought the package was small, there was a hundred sheets in each packet. When I tried it, it was super absorbent. I saw all the oil I didn&#x27;t realize I had and it made my skin feel less sweaty. I received a discount on this package but I would definitely buy it without the discount.</li>
    <li> product works just like they where meant to, pro is its in a gender natural packaging</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and I&#x27;ve seen lots of pictures with my very shiny face.  These blotting papers are perfect to keep my face oil free and shine free.  It is made of thicker material than other blotting papers I&#x27;ve tried.  I can use it over my makeup and not mess it up. It is powder free and good quality.</li>
    <li> These Day to Day Beauty blotting papers ended up being great quality and really economical compared to the papers I normally purchase locally. I like that they&#x27;re slightly larger than your typical blotting tissue allowing a single sheet to do your entire face, they don&#x27;t tear, they don&#x27;t seem to have a fragrance (not to my nose anyway which my sensitive skin prefers) nor do they disturb any foundation or even powder. They just remove the shine and really soak up excess oil. Would order again.    Day to Day Beauty sent a free sample pack for review.</li>
    <li> I live in Texas,so having good blotting papers is a must. It gets really hot here and I seat a lot! These papers are easy to dispense 1 at a time and they help remove the excess oil and sweat from my face without messing up my make up. If you are prone to oily skin or sweat a lot,then these would help you.&lt;br /&gt;They are the perfect size to throw in my person and since I got 2 I put 1 in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product free of charge to review in my home</li>
    <li> These work great. We live in the south and it is hard to make it through the day without sweating your make up off. these help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for a reduced rate in return for sharing my honest opinion</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and by the afternoon my gave is very greasy from my makeup.  With these blotting papers it absorbs everything and leaves my face flawless.</li>
    <li> item arrived on time,i tried it and it works good for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a night out. I use these to successfully get the oiliness off of my face.</li>
    <li> Difficult to remove individual sheets from their packaging.  Doesn&#x27;t absorb oil very well, Johnson &amp; Johnson Clean &amp; Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets are MUCH better.</li>
    <li> I purchased these face blotting papers for my teenage daughter who is dealing with problematic skin and she also enjoys wearing makeup. These are great for blotting an oily nose or other oily patch of skin dabbing at lipstick to blend in better as well as using after applying foundation to blend in better. A must have!!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! They work great and actually better than the big name brands- my fingers dont have that weird feeling on them after i wipe my face. I would recommend them to anyone, i use them multiple times a day!</li>
    <li> They are a little smaller than others I have used, but work!</li>
    <li> Day by Day Beauty Luxury Blotting Papers for Oily Skin. These blotting paper sheets are made with 100% fiber, comes with two packs-each with 100 sheets for a total of 200 blotting sheets. WOW! This two pack allows you to have one for two different purses or to share with others. These are wonderful. I have been using blotting sheets since high school and let&#x27;s just say, those were many years ago. These work great. We all want a glowing healthy look to our face but not shiny, greasy or cakey. These help you look glowing while keeping your make-up and face looking fresh. Why use these sheets? They remove excess oil without drying out your face and removing all your makeup. They remove the oil that is on face, a little make-up comes off but not enough to notice or effect your look. Removing the excess oil: keeps your face cooler; keeps acne from building and clogging pores; makes make-up look better and not too heavy; and makes you photo ready and looking your best. They are very absorbent, compact, easy to carry and use and biodegradable for green living. They also help remove dirt and toxins that are in the air that land on your skin. They save you money too. For, using these,  help you so you don&#x27;t have to apply powder to keep shine down or apply more make-up. These are great for: purses, travel, photo shoots, dates (don&#x27;t want shiny-greasy face), great gift items, great for teens just using make-up and learning about make-up and already having hormonal skin issues, for gift baskets, for stocking stuffers, bridesmaid gift baskets (gift i.e. jewelry, make-up, these blotting sheets and a great thank you note), for daily use and just to keep looking your best. Other uses that you will love are: to use with quills and fountain pens to keep documents clean, clear and avoid accidental smears; For phone and tablet screen degreaser and cleaner; Also, if you or friend ever tend to have an oily scalp/hair, you can use these by messaging them into hair roots which helps to absorb oils in a pinch; Also, use with lipstick too keep from having lipstick on teeth and smears. For face and skin, just simply dab over face and oily places and you will be shocked how much it absorbs and removes and how you face and complexion will then look matte.  I recommend and your friends and all who use them will love them too. I did receive these for the opportunity to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion. I use and carry them with me wherever I go and have for years. These are at a great value, work great, arrived quickly and backed with a 100% money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> I was impressed how well these really worked!  Took oil off I couldn&#x27;t see, but didn&#x27;t take any makeup off whatsoever.  Was nice and soft with no residue.</li>
    <li> Disappointing.  Very large, so if you need a little touch up, you waster a lot of expensive little papers.  Wish Bath and bodyworks still sold their papers.</li>
    <li> They absorb as advertised but the sheets are small. You would have to use atleast two to blot your face. But there are so many in a pack, I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> I was given the Day by Day Beauty Luxury Blotting Papers to review and was curious to see how they would work. I know that they are for blotting the oil from your face, but I wasn&#x27;t even sure if I had an oily face. I decided to let my teenage daughter try them first. I told her to just blot around her nose and forehead and see what would happen to the paper. Well as you can see from the before and after in the picture the oil does land on the paper. She asked me to let her have one of the packages for herself (you get 2 packages of 100 ea.) when you order, perfect for sharing.&lt;br /&gt;These face blotting sheets are made of premium-grade, natural pulp fiber that quickly absorbs unwanted oil without disturbing your makeup. They are also unscented which was a bonus for me. They are easy to take on the go, so you can keep one handy in your purse and the other at work. I was pleasantly surprised with how well they worked after trying them myself and would definitely recommend giving them a try</li>
    <li> This  Day by Day Beauty Luxury Blotting Paper is absolutely Perfect on my oily face,the size is real small, so its pretty handy,you can bring it anywhere even if just in your purse. I was so glad i found this product, so nothing for me to be worried every time my face get oily, This Blotting paper is a make up friendly.In each package it contains 100 sheets.Ill post pick for my used one sheet and the original which i never use..you can really see the difference between.and it can really help on you oily face. I got this free item for testing and review purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed. Drugstore brands work better. I used 3 on oily skin and barely saw a difference.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say anything another reviewer hasn&#x27;t mentioned. Helps me out during the summer months for sure.</li>
    <li> The item was sent to me for review. I love it! Highly recommend people with oily skin to get this product! Use it during the middle of the day to reduce shine, make your face less greasy!</li>
    <li> If your face gets oily like mine than these blotting papers are for you! As soon as I blotted my face with the tissue like paper all the oil went away. How do I know it was all on the paper. The results after using the blotting papers were great! My skin looked matified. I&#x27;m very pleased with these blotting papers. Here is the proof in the pics below:) warning you will see the blotting paper with oils from my face but hey that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re  used for:) but my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> After personally using on my face the Day by Day #1 Blotting Papers, I think they worked wonderfully for me. I also gave some to my teenage daughter and my teenage son to try. Skin is at its worst during the teenage years. These blotting papers worked very well for them as well. I&#x27;m a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> These blotting papers have many uses and are high quality. Here are some things you need to know about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blotting papers are 3.5&amp;#34; X 3&amp;#34;, they&#x27;re small enough to carry around in your purse or throw them in your center console of your vehicle. They come in a sleeve and sometimes stick together when you try and remove them. But once you&#x27;ve removed the first few it becomes easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbency:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The do soak up a great deal of oil from your skin. I work in very hot environments so I tested some of these to see if it would remove perspiration as well as oils. It did take more than one sheet to remove all the sweat and oil from my face. I used 3 of them, but I was in a plant that had temperatures exceeding 140 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife used them and had much better results. She can use just 1 to remove face oils before and after applying makeup. She also keeps them handy for touch ups through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paper Quality:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you rip the paper you&#x27;ll see the fibers that bind it together and they appear to be of good quality. They are thin and you can, in the right lighting see your fingers through them. This doesn&#x27;t diminish the quality in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t just use them for traditional uses, I went outside the box. I used them to clean my iPhone. I have an OtterBox case and it&#x27;s always smeared, but this did an excellent job of cleaning it. I also used it on my iPad and it removed all the fingerprints and excess oil left behind. For this alone I&#x27;d buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife used them to blot lipstick and foundation. Each use of the papers extended the life of her makeup. Less makeup touch ups saves money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you consider the cost of quality makeup vs these relatively inexpensive blotters, it&#x27;s a no brainier. These will save you money in the long run.</li>
    <li> These blotting papers are just okay. I give it 3 stars because of the price, the quantity of sheets, and that they do actually work. But they certainly aren&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve used. I usually have to use a couple. Other things to note is that they&#x27;re difficult to remove from the package (this is kind of a given though–they all are) and they tend to tear easily. But also, I have a skin regimen that involves various serums and a bit of oil so by the time I&#x27;m ready to apply my makeup, I need to use blotting papers to take care of any of the excess–and I noticed that once the oil hits the paper, it creates an unpleasant smell. And it&#x27;s not because my face is dirty – I&#x27;m using these after I cleanse. However, for the price, quantity, and decency of effectiveness, I would still recommend them.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. Age 67 has not relieved me of oily skin. I use them twice a day, usually late morning to late afternoon. It helps keep my skin free of blackheads and whiteheads. They do not remove makeup.</li>
    <li> These work but need to b larger</li>
    <li> Works great! I keep one pack in my purse &amp; another at the office.</li>
    <li> My fave loves these blotting sheets.  After using these my face feels more fresh and not so oily. I have my son trying these also, he always has that oily shine to his face.  These are small so they will fit in your purse and you can take everywhere with you.  What I also like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t removing my makeup. I still have my make up on and looking fresh...</li>
    <li> These blotting wipes are AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They great for both oily skin, combination, normal. Honestly great for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Animal Friendly company, NOT tested on animal, yay! :)&lt;br /&gt;-great for all skin types&lt;br /&gt;-actually work&lt;br /&gt;-EXTREMELY soft paper. I didn&#x27;t know paper could be this soft, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I haven&#x27;t found any&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend these blotting wipes? Absolutely.</li>
    <li> These blotting papers are more thin than some brands I&#x27;ve tried but have a great texture and still don&#x27;t fall apart when they&#x27;re being used. These are not powdery and don&#x27;t have a fragrance at all, which I think is fantastic. Another reviewer commented that they&#x27;re difficult to get out of the packaging, and I found that to be true, too. The first couple of papers I pulled out of each package came with a friend and tore a bit on the edges. That said, I love these. The size is just right for carrying in my bag and I love that these came in a package of two -- one for my day bag, one for a clutch at night. They remove oil and sweat without disturbing makeup, as long as I&#x27;m careful to *blot* and not *wipe.* I feel like their regular price ($10) is a bit higher than I&#x27;d want to pay ordinarily but the quality is definitely there.</li>
    <li> They are awesome, especially now in the summer.I recommend this for everybody who have an oily skin.Thanks for Amazing Group deals I got them in really good price.</li>
    <li> i loved these because they where so awesome but i wouldn&#x27;t buy again because of how much they cost for shipping in stores they cost like $1 for 1 packet of these that has 50 but i am not saying they didn&#x27;t work so you should buy them of course.</li>
    <li> Honestly I was quite skeptical at first, most sheets like this don&#x27;t always work for me. You see I have a very oily skin, so I was actually pretty impressed with all the oil the sheet actually picked up. They are very convenient and portable they&#x27;re very thin so they fit almost anywhere, which is honestly a big plus for me. Overall I actually really like this product.</li>
    <li> These are good blotting paper. You can use them even when you have makeup on. It will take off oil from your face but not your makeup. I recommend these to any one who has a oily face.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. I keep a pack in my purse for on the go and they work great at keeping down the shine on my face From mid day touch ups needed.Highly recommend these for women on the go.</li>
    <li> They absorb oils pretty well, but not as well as other brands.</li>
    <li> These things are awesome!! I will be buying more! I will not leave my house without a pack of these in my purse, they are great!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin, even though I use oil free make-up and mattifying primer...I still am oily.  Blotting papers are a must for me.  These are the best blotting papers I have ever used and believe me, I have tried them all.  They are real paper too which believe it or not makes a huge difference that you can see AND feel!  They are the perfect size for the t-zone and that is exactly where I need it most.  Plus it is a great value for the money.  I love these.  They are going to be a new staple in my purse.</li>
    <li> These blotting papers are a must-have for me.  I have oily skin and with the nice design of this package I can take these blotting sheets with me easily in my purse for touch-ups any time before I see people.  The sheets do not remove my makeup or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love these blotting papers! They are perfect for freshening up and not looking greasy without caking a lot of powder on. Perfect for slipping into your purse or pocket.</li>
    <li> Whether you use these on the goal to get rid of some oil that has accumulated throughout the day or because you&#x27;re in a rush and have no time to shower in the morning, these are great at giving your face a fresh look. I like that this came with two packs, that way I can keep one in my purse and one in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> These sheets are great at removing the oil from your shiny face. You can see the oil that was transfered to the sheet. I really like that the package is small and easy to carry in your purse or wallet.</li>
    <li> We received these and as my daughter is an aspiring cosmetologist she was excited she suffers from acne painful acne and these have been so helpful to keep the oil away and keep the acne away as well. She was quite happy with this brand.</li>
    <li> Although I live for blotting papers, these were just so-so, almost generic feeling. They had no scent to them which I tend to enjoy and although they worked effectively just like most blotting papers do, they only did the job for a short period of time. Was great to try for Amazon Deals free, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase on my own.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the clean and clear brand, but for the price I am satisfied with it. Some powder does come off on the paper when you use them, but not a lot. Bought them for my brother&#x27;s wedding which was outside, and since I knew plenty of people would probably ask to use one I opted to go for quantity over quality. I am still happy with my purchase though!</li>
    <li> When I was in high school a friend of mine would use these, he had me try one and I loved it. He was a foreign exchange student and he went back home, I couldn&#x27;t ever find him to ask what it was. Well I was on one of my amazon review pages and there they were! I was so happy and I received them free for my 100% unbiased opinion. I had gotten them for myself but my skin isn&#x27;t really that oily my fiance took them from me though :) He is in love with them and couldn&#x27;t believe how great they are. He works fast food so his skin is always greasy and he also has sensitive skin so it is hard for him to find stuff that works for him and that is just what the blotting paper does! It works PERFECT for him. So if you have sensitive oily skin these are for you!</li>
    <li> • Keep your skin fresh and dry whether you’re at home or away with Blotting sheets , designed to absorb perspiration to help you maintain a gorgeous makeup finish without stripping your skin  moisture.I daily go wih little makeup on my face to work .This sheets really helped me to takeout some excess oil  throughout the day ,without losing much of make up.I really hate to do makeup in the afternoon ..it really makes my skin clumsy . Now I am ready for the seminars and meetings within a few minutes .I really love the sheets .The sheets are made to softly conform to your skin’s contours and are ideal for use before makeup touch-ups. I received it at a free  for product testing purposes and this is my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> They really do the job. They keep my face shine free for one hour or two. I definitely need to apply them regularly. The only problem I find with these is that, sheets are super thin. It is hard not to get one sheet out of box without tearing it apart or pulling several sheets.</li>
    <li> I love using blotting papers, especially in the summer! They are great for keeping makeup fresh and face oil free! These are great papers and a good quality!</li>
    <li> I use the Clean and Clear Oil-Absorbing Sheets every day but I thought I would try this Luxury Blotting Paper (this item showed up when I searched &amp;#34;oil-absorbing sheets&amp;#34; at Amazon). I find this paper to be too-easily torn and when I used it to wipe the oil on my face, it also wiped some of my foundation and face powder.(This did not happen when I used the Clean and Clear Oil-Absorbing Sheets). So, this is just OK for me.</li>
    <li> My foundation has really taken a toll on my face lately. I usually have combination to oily skin. I found in my last few photos my face showed up super shiny so I purchased these at a promotional price. They are nice and light weight so I can toss one in my purchase and vehicle. They are great on the go and easy to toss once I am done using them. I like have two sets of 100 because I travel a lot.</li>
    <li> These are great blotting papers! I love that they are thick and durable, yet soft on your skin! They absorb oils extremely well! They are super convenient and fit easily into a pocket, purse, makeup bag, or anywhere else! I am extremely happy with these! *I received a sample to try and to give my honest unbiased opinion. The views in this review are completely my own!*</li>
    <li> Works great! Takes the shine/oil away immediately. Definitely the best blotting sheets I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Love how it works didn&#x27;t realize how much oils I had on my face. I showed my friend and she liked it so she is ordering some now. Thank you</li>
    <li> These worked really well it took a whole lot of oil off my face with just once but I had to use two of them. I like that two packs came with it</li>
    <li> They work really well to absorb oil without messing up your makeup.  Come in a small/ thin package to conveniently carry in your purse.</li>
    <li> got this product for exchange for my review&lt;br /&gt; i give it a three star because its ok not sure how it really works can&#x27;t tell much about it but thank you for letting me try it out</li>
    <li> These are a bit thinner than I expected. Almost like tissue paper for gifts. But they work! They absorb all the oils on my nose and leave it feeling much better. The only problem I have with them is it&#x27;s hard to get just one out at a time. I normally pull out 2 or 3 on accident. Oh well, if it works I don&#x27;t mind! I&#x27;d recommend this cheaper alternative to others out there 10/10 times.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t that great - barely noticed a difference after use. I typically use Clean &amp; Clear, and those do a much better job.</li>
    <li> I have an extremely greasy face. Hours after washing, I need something for the oil! I came across these blotting sheets and decided to give them a try. They are somewhat small, but NOT too small. I can cover my whole face with one sheet and be fine. I have actually grabbed for another sheet once and didn&#x27;t need it because the first sheet took care of my oil. These do exactly what they are supposed to do-blot the grease. They will sometimes rip when I am using them, but I just move to a different section and have no issues. Opening the package you will find a hello beautiful message which was pleasantly surprising. These also come in a neat package that closes for ease of use.  I will definitely be buying these sheets again for my consistently oily face.</li>
    <li> This blotting paper from Day by Day Beauty is really great for me.  The package comes in 2 packs and each contains 100 sheets which is very awesome. It is compact and would not take so much space in my purse or pocket so i can bring it everywhere i go so i&#x27;m always ready for a photo shoot. :) Whenever i feel like my skin is getting quite oily already or whenever we go somewhere and i just feel like my face already accumulated dirt from dust or pollution, i just grab this blotting paper to wipe away easily those excessive oil and dirt on my face so i get a fresh and cleaner skin again quickly. It is very absorbent and really effective, it will takes away my shiny looking face in seconds. It is soft so it doesn&#x27;t hurt or scratch my face whenever I&#x27;m using it. I really love this product. I got this complimentary product for testing and review purposes. All thoughts and opinions are of my own and were not swayed by anyone.</li>
    <li> These are really awesome.  Ever breakout somewhere and you have a glow that you just do not want.  These blotting sheets are just the right answer.  You can use these to blot away that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  They do not smear makeup like some I have used in the past.  I was so glad I got to try these and give my opinion.  They come in a small package that makes it very easy to put in your purse or makeup case.  I love these and will certainly be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about the Day By Day Blotting Paper is the texture of the papers. I have used blotting paper in the past and sometimes they can be really thin and tear easily, these aren&#x27;t like that though. They also hold a TON of oil! Usually, it would take me two or three on a summer day. However, with these I only have to use one. My other favorite thing about the Day By Day Beauty Blotting Paper is that it comes in a two-pack with 100 sheets each! Meaning I can stick one in my purse, and leave the other on my vanity. I would totally recommend these if your looking for quality blotting sheets.</li>
    <li> When I was sent this product to review, I was excited to try them out! The papers are very soft and not too flimsy. I have used them a few times and really like them. They keep the shininess away and they do not disturb your makeup, which is really nice. Each little pack has about 100 papers and each order comes with 2 packs. The packs are small enough you can just throw them in your purse and use them when you need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would also be great to have if you workout before you go to work. All that sweat brings on oil and dirt. Keep a pack of these in your gym bag. I have also been using them on 3 day hair to blot out the oil instead of using dry shampoo. They are working really well for that too!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the compact size of this product fool you into thinking it doesn&#x27;t do its job. I am a busy mother and love that I can carry these in my purse and grab quickly without sacrificing space in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;I use these blotting papers in public or at home. I even keep a pack in my nitestand to use shall my face feel greasy. I was surprised as to the effectiveness of these blotting papers when I first tried them. But low and behold they pull the grease from your face without sacrificing the time you may  have spent doing your makeup. I suffer from occasional acne and oily skin and these blotting papers have really been phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone that wants a product that works. I will be purchasing more when I&#x27;m near to running out.</li>
    <li> 4.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blotting sheets are plain white, and have the feel of tissue paper. They are very thin, and I found they would break during use. Overall, they worked extremely well. I did sometimes have to use two sheets to get all of the oil off my face, but in the end I always got the shine-free result I wanted. They definitely left my makeup intact, but I did notice a bit of my foundation came off onto the sheet. This is probably due to the oil, and not the blotting sheet, but I still wanted to mention it.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying the blotting papers, its so hot and humid in Seattle rite now that withing 2 hours of out, you will make be shinning mess, using this blotting paper to beat that, they work really good. i tested them longest on Monday it was 82 degree, get my makeup done and all at 9 am in morning, then whole day i was out used this blotting paper at 12 noon, and looked so refresh than again at 5 pm and it instantly make me like refreshed after even 7 hrs, and get back home at 9 pm. so all in my 12 hrs out i didn&#x27;t feel shinning mess, or tired face. it was a good day with refreshed face. i have even tried the higher brand ones also, but the quality and value for money can&#x27;t beat these blotting paper. you get 200 sheets of them in this pack, i guess it will last me at least 6 months.Got these at discounted rate but really loving it and these are my personal opinion.</li>
    <li> I will start by saying I haven&#x27;t used blotting sheets in ages.  But I got a good discount on them so I thought I would give them a try.  When I opened these I thought they just looked like tissue paper.  However, when I used it I was really surprised!  It worked really well.  I was much less shiny after I used them.  They come in very convenient packs.  I found the sheets come out easily and don&#x27;t tear as you take them out of the box.  I keep one pack in my purse and one in my car now.</li>
    <li> My face tend to be oily at certain times so I thought of using this and it works.  What I like about it is it&#x27;s hassle-free, handy and you can use it just about anywhere and next thing you know you&#x27;ll be as fresh as the light of day. :)  I always have one in my purse.</li>
    <li> These papers worked well, they definitely helped me get my face matte (I like to use sunscreen moisturizer in the summertime which inevitably gets shiny)-my only complaint is the paper tended to break which is different from others I&#x27;ve used in the past (Muji). I suppose you&#x27;re throwing them away anyway, so some might not see this as an issue. The 2 pack is a good deal since each pack has 100 papers which will likely last me about a year!</li>
    <li> As you can see from  the  pictures  the first  one is what  it  looks  like  fresh out of the package  and the  second  picture  is what  it  looks  like  after it was used. My thoughts  are that  the  texture  of the paper  differs from that of your  large  name  brand  companies. But it works  pretty  well and I&#x27;m happy  with  this product. It&#x27;s also more budget  friendly  than your large  name  brand  companies. I would  buy this again. I received  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review  and this is it.</li>
    <li> These work well. I agree with the other reviews in that they are too small. I have to use two at a time on some days.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the rating is so high for this product. It does not absorb oil easily, just slightly better than regular paper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used blotting papers like these ones before, but these are wonderful! All of the other blotting papers I&#x27;ve used felt more like plastic. These just feel like thin, super absorbent paper. I like to keep one pack in my purse to take along with me wherever I go, and keep one at home with my makeup. These sheets pick up any unwanted shine easily and quickly. The words &amp;#34;Hello, Beautiful&amp;#34; on the inside of the package makes me smile every time I open them up. You get 200 sheets in total, so they will most definitely last me quite some time. Love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product Received for Testing and Review</li>
    <li> I have combination skin but when my face gets oily, there is mass amount and it is very shiny. I have blotting sheets with me all the time, but when I run out, I would improvise and use any type of paper. I bought this and wasn&#x27;t really impressed. I&#x27;ve used other blotting sheets where it is very absorbent. I felt that the material for this brand wasn&#x27;t the same quality. Hopefully this works for other people but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with these....they seemed to work ok but didn&#x27;t keep my face oil free very long. I feel as though I would have to use these several times a day to actually get results. They were also very small so it was kind of hard to hold onto them and blot my face at the same time.</li>
    <li> I have very oily face in summer. The blotting paper is best for my shining face. I usually use clear&amp;clean, but this one is not bad! One star for the price.Little expensive. BTW I get this for free.</li>
    <li> These sheets do take off a small amount of make up when used, I use Neutrogena shine control and I use the sheets immediately after I apply it. My face is very oily no matter what season or temperature, make up or no make up, so I decided to try these because I&#x27;m sick of being oily all of the time. I am very happy with the way these sheets work because they soak up everything, even though I have to use more than one sheet I am completely happy and amazed with these. I would absolutely recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> If you’re feeling or wanting to know if you’re very oily, this is the right product for you. At a discounted price, my wife and I both tried this product out. I never felt oily on my skin but when I blotted my forehead I got a result I did think I would get with a lot of body oil for just my forehead. This is a product that I will recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The packages are slim and work well for getting the oil, so they deliver as promised. However, they do not seem Earth friendly at all..With the environmental crisis facing the world and a direct threat to humanity EVERYONE and EVERYONE COMPANY should be doing anything and everything they can to reduce reuse and recycle. Sustainability is the name of the game. I would say if you&#x27;re concerned about your oily face to use a soft cloth you can wash and reuse or try cleaning your face and using some type of oil (argan, coconut, etc.) Sounds crazy but like disobey like, do your research and give it a try..or get these since they do work.. Thank you Day by Day Beauty for allowing me to try these free for my ho set review!</li>
    <li> I am consistently dealing with oil secretion on my face throughout the day. Just enough to bleed through my makeup and aggravate me. These wipes do an amazing job of soaking all of it up; I normally do a quick blot and a swipe of my powder brush and I am good for quite a few hours.</li>
    <li> These work great for the T-Zone area.  I have sensitive skin and I get really oily around my nose.  I carry these in my purse and boom the oily face is gone.  I used to use powder but didn&#x27;t realize that they contain oil and therefore you adding more oil to your face.  These work great.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves using these.They are always clean and quick to use.They work very nice.Very easy to transport in purse.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these blotters! They keep my skin (particularly my oily T zone) looking fresh and healthy throughout the day.The paper is lightweight and comfortable on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that they are non-scented, and therefore good for sensitive skin and are gender neutral. These blotting sheets worked just as well for me as they did when I tested them on my dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is with the packaging; the paper case is sometimes difficult to close. Overall, would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it! My daughter loves to share with friends at school. Great gifts for teenagers.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t absorb oil like I thought they should. They would work better if they were made out of a different oil absorbing material.</li>
    <li> I have first heard of these kind of papers like about.. 15 years ago and always wanted&lt;br /&gt;some for myself.. and I finally got em!&lt;br /&gt;They are ok.. you need to use a couple to fully get all of the oil off.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing really special lol!</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this product. I&#x27;m not sure if it was because my face gets very  oily that it didn&#x27;t work too we&#x27;ll or maybe it was 86 degrees today. But it was only one day of me trying it also. I think in cooler weather this product would be perfect.  I love the fact that it can fit in my clutch. It does absorb oil</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think highly of this face blotting paper that I got for testing and review purposes. I picked the package after work and it was really a perfect time to try it as my face is oily in the middle of the afternoon. To my surprise it exceed my expectation. Not only it removed oil and dirt, it didn&#x27;t destroy my make up unlike my old blotting paper. The paper is thicker and more absorbent so instead of using 2-3 papers at a time, I only used one so it will definitely last longer.</li>
    <li> Wow!  These are awesome!  Handy packaging, fits nicely in my purse for on the go touch ups, gets rid of the shine without disturbing makeup like regular tissues do, love them!  Thank you for the great customer service and quick ship, I received them in a day!  Happy customer!</li>
    <li> I got these blotting sheets for free from this seller after I was interested in purchasing it. I have to say I have VERY oily skin and these sheets work wonders!! They are so tiny and compact and I can carry them around easily and be inconspicuous as I blot my face. They absorb oil very well and made my skin matte. I saw a little bit of my makeup on the strip as well, but it did not remove all my make up or alter my look so I was happy. All in all, you&#x27;ll be getting a great product, great price, fast shipping and great seller so I would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Very effective blotting sheets!  I really put it to the test, using after a 12 hour work day.  One sheet easily removed all the oil build up and left my skin nicely matte and fresh. I was really impressed by how well they performed.  The packaging is nice, easy to fit in your purse for on the go.</li>
    <li> I loved this product a lot. :)</li>
    <li> my wife said it okay,well this Luxury blotting paper - day by Day beauty has 100 sheets per pack and easy to bring , easy to fit to her pouch and easy to access. And good thing about this is its absorb the oil to your face and also a make up friendly , and i get this item in amazon for free after a promo code but this is $9 for 200 sheets which is 2 pack</li>
    <li> They are not nearly as good as the clean and clear brand, however they do the job just fine. My issue with these one is they are essentialy just tissue paper. The clean and clear blotting sheets are smooth and soft, whereas these ones are coarse and can irritate the skin. These however are a much better bargain so I will probably just buy these in the future.</li>
    <li> Love these and the price is right!  Great packaging...</li>
    <li> i really loved these sheets,the package is very cute and compact to be easily put on even small purses. it really absrbs oil well from my face very softly,now i have them with me whenever I go&lt;br /&gt;I was very lucky to receive this product for free in exchange to my honest reveiw,thanks</li>
    <li> For conscientious reasons, I have change my previous negative review. I start enjoying using this product. My use is not of conventional still here it is.   I can&#x60;t use creams on so I started using essential oils about  a year ago. I loved the results, however I continued to have occasional pimples on my forehead.. but no longer. After applying and massaging essential oil into my face, I wash my hands with soap and then use half of the sheet under my eyes and on my forehead. I love essential oil and I don&#x60;t have to worry about the pimples any longer.</li>
    <li> This one is so much better compare to the expensive one I&#x27;ve been using definitely worth a try and it save me more penny!</li>
    <li> I purchased both these, along with the Clean &amp; Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets.  While their brand changes color more when in contact with oil, these sheets work just as well if not better.  In one test, I cleaned with these first, then used the Clean and Clear.  It didn&#x27;t pick up ANY additional oil.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> These blotting papers are fantastic.. I carry some in my purse, keep some at work, and gave some to my mom.. Even my brother tried them! I would definitely recommend them. They blot oil from your face without taking off your makeup!</li>
    <li> I like this product! It is convenient and helps effectively soak up sweat without messing up my makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Japanese oil blotting papers and they work better than these. These aren&#x27;t bad per se but they really aren&#x27;t good either. I have to really press my face hard to get the oil on the sheets, I wish they absorbed easier.</li>
    <li> the paper is relalively thick which i did not expect it to be so. i received it with a dicount</li>
    <li> I just love item very much.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and gets a lot</li>
    <li> Living in FL these blotting sheets are perfect to have on hand!  Applying more powder makes my makeup look caked on at times, with these sheets simply blotting around my T Zone I no longer have to use my powder.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently in south carolina and this sheets are a lifesaver. My skin is excessively oily all the time due to the heat. These sheets work wonders and remove the oil quickly without smudges of my makeup. I will definitely buy some more.</li>
    <li> I have an oily face, I constantly have to wash my face because of how oily it is.  I have ache problems as well.  I love these plotting papers, so far I have been using them through out the day and I am highly satisfied.</li>
    <li> Do what they are supposed to do</li>
    <li> Pretty good at stopping your face from shining.  Good for before pictures and date nights.  Soft on skin and leaves your skin feeling fresh.  It is good for its value.</li>
    <li> Works great. Very soft and absorbent.</li>
    <li> I got it for free in change for a review. It works on me really good. The only thing I do not like is it is a little bit dry on my face after using it. I need to use some spray after. But anyway, I like it and the package contains a lot so I thing I can use it for a long tim.e</li>
    <li> The day by day beauty blotting cloths are awesome in this texas heat from sweat it helps without taking the makeup off as well as when my face has the t spot oil marks. My husband laughs and says we can cook with that oil I take off with the blotting cloths. I love how many come in a single order. The ones I have gotten from the store have maybe 10 in each package. These are handy as well to just throw in your purse makeup bag or travel bag if you need on vacation. I like using them even without makeup because sometimes my face gets oily as well without makeup and it helps take away the shine.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
    <li> I received these for review purposes. Opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;These are a great value! You get 200 sheets which will last for a very long time. These are very convenient. They easily fit in your purse or pocket and can be pulled out at a moment&#x27;s notice. If you feel oily or shiny before a photo, grab one and blot away! I didn&#x27;t feel shiny, but I tried them. As you can tell from the photo, I did have excess oil!&lt;br /&gt;It did take off some of my makeup. That is the only reason I only gave it 4 stars. It appears it took off some of my bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I am going to keep them in my purse and use them to freshen up when I am out and about!</li>
    <li> I love these blotting papers they work well, I will be honest they kind of remind me of something you would find in a high end hotel because of the name and packaging. It&#x27;s a nice price for the amount you get and it works over makeup too, to remove oil in my t zone.</li>
    <li> probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again, worked ok</li>
    <li> Amazing blotting sheets! The other amazing part is that you get double in your order 100 sheets per package, so 200 sheets. Awesome to keep in your purse and one in the car. A great size as well. Not too big and just right. Sometimes they are very large and you waste the other part of the sheet, but these are a great size. No waste.</li>
    <li> Great for my shiny forehead</li>
    <li> Right in my &amp;#34;T-zone&amp;#34; I have oily skin so to have something easy to blot it off without needing a mirror or soap and water is really handy for me. I like how small the packets are so they can easily fit in my purse or even wallet. It gets rid of the oil and makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to order these. My skin is very oily and usually by lunch my face is shiny and oily looking. I purchased these looking for something that would work better than a kleenex. These are awesome. I love how they do the job without wiping off my make up. You can see all the oil transfer to the paper thingy, but no make up on the paper thingy. Works great for a mid day makeup refresher, and they are small enough to throw in your purse.</li>
    <li> These blotting papers are great! Fors starters I love that they come 2 packages per order and they really do remove excess oil off my skin especially in my T-zone. They are a great size, so they&#x27;re easy to manage.  The pack is a good size to take in your bag or wristlet. I love that they&#x27;re fragrance free! These are very absorbent as you can see in the picture. Bottom line: Love these little sheets!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s safe to say I have very oily skin. I used 2 blotting papers for my entire face and was surprised at the amount of oil on the sheets! There were also areas on my face where I was wearing foundation (as a concealer for certain areas around my chin, nose, and forehead) and the sheets didn&#x27;t disrupt the foundation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the box is small enough to stick in your pocket or a small makeup bag. This order comes with two boxes each containing 100 sheets for a total of 200 sheets. If you have very oily skin, you&#x27;ll likely be using 2 sheets at a time which gives you 100 uses. And if you plan on blotting the oil from your face at least twice a day, then these won&#x27;t last even 2 months. Just something to think about prior to purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend these blotting papers because they clearly work well and are effective at absorbing the oil from my face.</li>
    <li> Like this, keeps my face clean after half of day staying outside.</li>
    <li> The pros about this product are you get a lot for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The con is that you will use a ton because it is really hard to get just one paper out at a time. I go to grab one and four or five come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work ok to to get the oil off and it doesn&#x27;t smudge my make up. I really hope that they improve on the packaging because I feel like I waste a ton trying to get them out :(</li>
    <li> i like these since they don&#x27;t leave any powder residue like other blotting papers i used before.  I also like the packaging very fancy!</li>
    <li> Since my face can get a little oily during the day, these really come in handy!  So glad I got them and definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> I received these today and the papers were amazing and high quality, best I have used so far.  I have t-zone oil and this will help so much.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Loved this. Didn&#x27;t leave you like a greaseball</li>
    <li> Totally fantastic and completely portable.  I have a lot of shine, and this product removes it instantly.  It leaves my face feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day.  I would recommend this product to any skin type.</li>
    <li> if you have oily skin then this product is made exactly for you. I always have them in my purse and can&#x27;t go anywhere without them. Just can&#x27;t imagine my working day without blotting sheets, i use 2 sheets everyday so this pack is very long-lasting. But anyway try to buy them as often as possible.</li>
    <li> I received these and fell in love.  They definitely help me keep my face clean.  I work at a bar and I am always &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; when we are busy.  These allow me to bring back my natural look.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Oil absorbing sheets are thin and work instantly. All I have to do is lightly tap my skin where it is shiny (around my nose, chin, forehead) and the paper keeps my face clean. I really like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my makeup with these papers. No more adding a ton of powder and making my face look cakey.</li>
    <li> There is nothing more annoying to me than feeling greasy and looking shiny even after I&#x27;ve done my very best job on my makeup for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, I&#x27;ve tried a wide variety of blotting papers, including the brands Clean and Clear and Elf. While those two bands worked well, and ELF has really wonderful prices, neither of them could compare to the Day by Day sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With other brands of blotting papers, I typically have to use 2-3 sheets to get that &#x27;clean and fresh&#x27; feeling on my skin....&amp; sometimes they&#x27;d strip off my foundation along with any oil on my skin- which wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Day by Day- I only need ONE paper to make my ENTIRE face feel fresh, and these papers don&#x27;t take my makeup off along WITH my skin&#x27;s impurities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The premium materials used in this product really do pay off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not all, though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Day by Day company is small, family run, and located right here in the U.S. so you can feel GOOD about purchasing from them. Every product they sell is backed by a 100% money back guarantee for the LIFETIME of the product, which isn&#x27;t a common promise in the beauty world. These products cater to women young and are old- and are made from natural and organic materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I can&#x27;t think of anything better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this particular product for free in order to review it here and on my personal beauty blog, but I have fallen in love and will definitely be making purchases from this company in the future!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and it gets worst when I apply foundation. These blotting papers help so much with my skin. The papers take up most of the oil leaving my face 80% oil free which is amazing. They fit in my purse so I could take them on go and use them whenever I need them. They work well with my make-up and only take off a little bit of my foundation but mostly they take off the oil.</li>
    <li> Love these, they catch all the extra oil, for a smooth shine free face. You get a good amount in each pack as well.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. My skin is both dry and oily. Usually by the end of the day the make-up on my skin causes my skin to be oily. It makes my skin feel really gross. If I use a tissue to wipe my face it will wipe off my make-up and that’s not necessarily what I’m wanting to do. I just want to get rid of the excess oil on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I like how these facial blotting papers are compact and can easily fit in your purse, pocket or make-up bag. They are thin and kind of like tissue paper except they are super absorbent. I can remove the excess oil on my face without removing my make-up. My skin becomes oil free and doesn’t feel gross anymore. The only downside to these papers is they are somewhat difficult to remove from the package. I typically pull out two or three pieces trying to get just one paper. It doesn’t affect the quality of this product. These blotting papers are a must have in every make-up bag!</li>
    <li> Great seller and speedy shipping, this is my first facial blotting papers I have ever tried and I must say, I was surprise as to how much oily skin I actually had. it&#x27;s pretty awesome to see how easy it removes oil from your face, places you didn&#x27;t think you had that issue with. They come in a small package so you can take them everywhere you go, will recommend them</li>
    <li> I ordered these blotting papers on a special promotion to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;I have never used blotting papers before now. My daughter swears by them, so I figured we could each have a pack.&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the day sometimes my Tzone gets really oily feeling. I used these blotting papers to help combat that and they work really well!!&lt;br /&gt;The papers are thin but very absorbent!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these Luxury blotting papers by Day by Day beauty.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free and I LOVE it!!  I will be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> These get all of the shininess from oil off of your face without removing all your makeup. Super portable too!</li>
    <li> “Facial Blotting Paper” are really a nice thing to have especially if you have an oily skin or even if you have mix skin. you can apply them in the oily parts to absorb extra oil. These work absolutely great since they are very absorbent. Although there is 100 premium, high quality 100% natural fiber sheets in every pack, it easily fit into purse or your makeup bag, since its pack is very small and, and tiny. It easily take off a lots of oil and dirt of your skin, I mean it easily as it did for me. I love this product, I simply amazed with this product. I set one pack in my make up bag which I carry in my purse, just in case, if I need to remove oil, dirt or … I definitely recommend it. It is not a luxury when you see what will it do for you!</li>
    <li> Worked well for me and came in handy.  I keep them in my purse and use as needed</li>
    <li> Great delivery and arrived as promised!</li>
    <li> The paper breaks really easy. I&#x27;ll stick to the oil absorbing sheets at CVS/Walgreens.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as the ones you can find at the store.</li>
    <li> I would buy it next time,because this time was free!And the paper can control the oil really good.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a bad review and received a refund from the manufacturers. They are definitely concerned with the level of satisfaction of their customers.</li>
    <li> When I opened these up, I was pleasantly surprised. They were the standard size I’ve seen for this type of product, but the papers seemed thicker than the ones I had previously been using. I hoped this would mean they would soak up the oil with just one sheet. And it worked! It completely absorbed the oil on my face–and with only one sheet! These Day by Day Beauty Blotting Papers are the happy medium I’ve been searching for. Two packages are included, which is 200 sheets for less than $10. Comparable blotting papers can cost in upwards of $20 for the same amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With warmer weather and oilier skin on the horizon, these blotting papers are going to come in handy. I’ve already put one package in my car and the other in my work bag. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> It picks up oil really well and leaves skin feeling a lot cleaner.</li>
    <li> These blotting papers are so convenient and they really work. I keep one in my purse and my teen daughter keeps one in her book bag. We live at the beach so the humidity will always cause a damp face. These are great to dry the dampness without taking off all of our make up. Both of our skin type is very oily also and these are great to use every day to keep the shine off our faces.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these to any of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;*I was given these at a promotional price to test and provide my honest unbiased feedback and opinions.*</li>
    <li> Love these!! I have oily/dry skin, so these are great. Especially for the T-zone. Makes my skin feel so much better.</li>
    <li> I really loved these. They are great for blotting your T-zone and take the shine away!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing thing ever! They fit in small hand bags, pockets, purses, in your car, where ever you go. I used them while on a recent photo shoot for a client who was a bit shiny. These things work wonders. You can actually see the oil on the sheets. Oddly fantastic...definitely a must for have for any woman&#x27;s purse.</li>
    <li> I Love these!! They absorb so well and are so easy to use.  Fit in my pocket so I&#x27;m never without them!</li>
    <li> Just got these blotting papers and was excited to try them.  I have always had a problem with my face being oily so I thought I would gives these papers a try.  They work really nicely and it doesn&#x27;t disturb your make up. I was about to remove the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; on my face without reapplying make up or washing my face entirely.</li>
    <li> These are excellent they keep the oil off and thr shine off as well... i love these the quantity is great as well... easy to take with you in a purse i know thats where mine are going.. no harsh feeling no residue either... thank you for this fab deal</li>
    <li> I got these for my husband. He has very oily skin and acne problems. They work so well and do exactly as promised. He loves them and it seems to be helping him to have less breakouts. He keeps them at home and at work and uses them a few times a day. We are both thrilled with this product!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin, sometimes it looks as though I&#x27;m melting. These little sheets come in handy for my oily days. I love it.</li>
    <li> works well. Cleans up alot of the oil off my face and leaves me feeling clean and refreshed</li>
    <li> When I first got the papers I thought that they looked like the toilet seat covers but the are a little thicker than others. One issue that I had with the product is that you always end up pulling more than one sheet. There was no smell coming from the paper as I used it but when I sniffed it to see what it smelled like there was a little bit of a paper odor. Overall though, I like it. It gets the jobs done and takes off oil. I read other reviews that said it is not make up friendly but I don&#x27;t wear make up so I did not have a problem with it. I do believe that it is a little bit pricey for the product but it does take the oil off and seems more durable than other papers. The packaging is sturdy and compact so that you can carry it around.</li>
    <li> I found it a little bit expensive, but quality is very good. I&#x27;t works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I do using different kind of facial wash for oily face but its still the same i still got oily face especially when im outside im always worried about how i look so i give a try on this and i took it with me all the time and its just very helpful as it really absorbs the excess dirt and oil freshen me enough all the time.I do loved this as its make up free i dont need to do retouch in all time when my face feeling oily.Its natural and no chemicals on it unlike using any kind of brands for oil treatment.No smell or anything its just like a regular tissue paper.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this product its really great to have.It is also very handy to take as is is lightweight and fit enough in any make up bag.&lt;br /&gt;with the price it comes with 2 box with 100 pieces each so total of 200 pieces not bad as it can be use in longer time.and it doesnt have any expiration so can be use anytime or even in longer time.Higly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided in review purposes.</li>
    <li> Blotting sheets work great when out all day and need to freshin up while on the go.  Keep them in my purse/car.</li>
    <li> They mean it when they say Premium. I love it.</li>
    <li> I really like these. Great that they&#x27;re packaged to pop in your purse and you get 2, one for home and one on the go. As a mother of 3 they&#x27;re perfect for a quick touch up...and honestly sometimes that&#x27;s all I have time for! They work great.</li>
    <li> I have an oily skin type and before noon, my face is so oily I can fry an egg already. (Kidding!) But my face is really oily. One thing I always keep in my bag and my glove compartment is a blotting paper for my face. In times when I have make up on or when there&#x27;s no sink nearby to wash my face with water, I use blotting paper to reduce oil and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Day By Day Beauty Luxury Blotting Paper is effective in removing excess oil from my face thus, making my skin look fresh and NOT shiny. :) I like these blotting paper because they don&#x27;t easily tear or break even if it has absorbed oil already. Other blotting papers I&#x27;ve tried tear at the middle the moment they come absorb excess oil from my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how I only need to use 1 blotting paper every time I need to wipe of excess oil from my face. They&#x27;re smooth and unscented which reduces skin irritation. They&#x27;re very handy and I like how they&#x27;re packed because I can put one in my bag and glove compartment with no problems. Goodbye excess shine and oily face! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample to inspect, try and review. No other form of compensation was received. All opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> These are awesome for those sweaty days where you have some shine on your face.  They do a really good job of stripping the oils off your skin, and leave your face looking fresh.  I&#x27;m planning on taking these to Florida on our Disney vacation, they will be a lifesaver in the heat!  You also get a lot for the price, these are a great deal.</li>
    <li> Love these they help keep my face looking fresh and absorb all the oil............No SHINE here!!! . And so easy to slip them into my purse.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin then you know just how shiny your face is within.... oh 5 minutes of adding putting on make up. It&#x27;s frustrating!! Day by Day Beauty&#x27;s Blotting Papers absorb all the shine and oil and leave my make up in place. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased if I tried.</li>
    <li> The blotting strips work great! I am so happy with my purchase. It was a great product for an incredible price and value. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get them out of the package, unless you don&#x27;t mind grabbing a bunch of sheets at once. They work okay for blotting oil off my face, no better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried. However, I like to keep a package of blotting paper in my purse, and so it&#x27;s really annoying that I can&#x27;t just get a single sheet out at a time.</li>
    <li> I love it.. It&#x27;s really work in my face.. I feel so fresh and blooming bec of blotting paper .. I definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> Paper sheets.  Not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Still prefer clean and clear.</li>
    <li> I have tried and used other brand name Blotting Sheets. These papers are slightly thicker and absorb a lot of oil. I have very oily skin so these sheets takes all the oils out. Very easy just blot on your entire face. It kept the oil off my face for the entire day which was great. I suggest these blotting sheets if you have moderate to oily skin or sweat a lot. I keep them with me in my pocketbook so I always have them. They are packaged very well. Instead of having a shiny face after blotting you have a matte soft looking skin face. A must buy ....</li>
    <li> I really love these blotting face paper sheets. I bought them for myself to keep handy in my purse. My daughter loves them also. Silky smooth. Definitely going to order them again!</li>
    <li> Works so well. I&#x27;ve used other brands and this one works just as well as very expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Truly amazing product! These blotting papers sure do the trick and soak up any excess oil on the face without taking off any make up leaving you will a matte finish! You get 2 packages both having 100 papers! Great quality and awesome item. I carry this in my purse for any touch ups!</li>
    <li> I love these blotting papers! Not only does this set have a lot of them included, but they work great. We have been using breathe right strips and it is a pain to wash my face right before bed since my face gets so oily within a couple of minutes and then the strips won&#x27;t stick. I have been using these in the afternoon and before bed and it takes off more oil then my face wash does! It&#x27;s awesome because then the strips stay on all night, I even have my hubby using the blotting papers on a regular basis and he loves them too! Definitely worth the purchase and I would highly recommend them to anyone that has oily skin!</li>
    <li> My husband’s face is like an oil mine; always secreting oil, so whenever his picture is taken his face is shinny. Recently we went for an outing and asked him to use the blotting paper before taking a picture. He was hesitant at first but agreed to me, when I made a sad face, and used the blotting paper. He needed 3 papers for his entire face. The paper soaked every little bit of oil from his face and his face look clean and non-shinny at-last. The picture came out pretty good too; his face was at-last not shinning under the sun, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;The Day by Day Beauty Blotting papers are very good at absorbing oil from face. The price is good too, for 200 sheets it is $11.95. But the papers are really small and you will need more than one to cover the whole face. It comes in 2 packs, 100 sheets in each and is really compact which makes it easier to carry in the smallest hand clutches too.&lt;br /&gt;The design of the pack makes it difficult to take out only one sheet, every time I used the papers more than one sheet came out from the pack. So a better packaging would be better.&lt;br /&gt;I keep these in my hand bag and they really come in handy when refreshing the make-up. I just soak all the oil up and I get a much fresher look good thing is that they did not smudge my makeup too.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free to test and review. The opinion stated above are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I love that you get 200 sheets... that&#x27;s WAY more than with the other blotting papers I was buying. The papers themselves are pretty standard. They certainly do the job and cause no adverse skin reactions. I keep them at my desk at work and blot mid-day and I&#x27;m good to go! Thankfully these do not alter my make up... love that. I received these for review, and I really enjoy them!</li>
    <li> I recieved these as a promotion from Amazing Deals Group. At first when I opened them up I though they were just gift paper. The real thin kind. But when I started blotting my face and the top of my husband&#x27;s head you could defineltly see the oil residue. These will work wonderfully for removing make-up from those hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> I got this free to try from Tomoson, and i really like it! On the other hand, my roommate had some sort of reaction to it. Everyone reacts differently, though and i love them! They take off all of the oil and leaving my skin feeling better than when i started.</li>
    <li> Midway through the day when your face is oily you have two options. Option one is to apply another layer of powder and pray you don&#x27;t look like a cakey mess. And option number two is to use these amazing blotting sheets to absorb all the oil and leave your skin and makeup looking great. I will choose option two, and I&#x27;m sure you would too. These things are like a sponge, they absorbed so much oil I don&#x27;t know whether to be impressed at how well they worked or horrified at how gross my skin was that day. I super recommend these, they work great and were a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these for testing/reviewing purposes. All opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try this Blotting paper complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.  You get 2 blotting paper packages of 100 each.  This is so nice to share with a family member or keep one in my purse and one in bathroom.  These papers are great quality.  I have oily skin.  They absorbed the oil quickly and got rid of the shine.  I also like they do not mess up my makeup.  Very nice for the price.</li>
    <li> I really like this blotting papers. They work so well and they are the perfect carrying size. My skin can get shiny after a couple of hours of wearing makeup and I&#x27;m starting to get those &amp;#34;My Own Personal Summer&amp;#34; moments. These come in handy for both those occasions. I was about to buy some from a very high end beauty website. Instead I got double the amount of the product and these work wonderfully. Great Product!</li>
    <li> This was inexpensive and that&#x27;s what you get.  The paper feels like someone cut up the toilet seat cover you find in restrooms.  It lifts some oil but also rubs off foundation so you will have to reapply make up, and the skin still feels a little oily - I have to use 2-3 sheets.  I have a very oil skin and the best one I&#x27;ve used is Gatsby Facial Oil Blotting Paper, also available from Amazon (one says for Man but they&#x27;re the same, go with the cheaper one).  One sheet of Gatsby and my skin feels clear of oil without losing the foundation.</li>
    <li> Beauty is my daily quest. Body, soul, and mind. No matter my environment I always try to keep myself looking great. So what do I carry in my purse at all times this Summer? My Day by Day Beauty Luxury Blotting Paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see this girl is a girly girl but 90&#x27;s Summer temperatures do not always make it easy to keep my makeup looking glamorous. Needless to say I need a little help. Relying on items like blotting sheets to keep the oils at bay and keeping my skin and makeup looking fresh is key. But not all blotting sheets are the best. Day by Day perfected the sheets with natural pulp fiber sheets, made it cruelty-free, and not to mention the price point is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is my Instagram ready at all times, Summer must, keep in your purse always item.... truly my Day by Day Luxury Blotting Sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it. It is guaranteed. It comes in a pack of two. One for you and another for you :)</li>
    <li> I had never used a product like this. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Very nice and easy to carry in your purse.</li>
    <li> I am an extremely oily skin girl and need to carry two blotting sheet boxes with me at all times.  I have tried so many and when I was given a chance to review these I was excited.  They are white blotting sheets and are 100 sheets per box.  They do a great job at absorbing oil but it&#x27;s hard to take one sheet out at a time.  One recommendation is to maybe put a double sided tape on the top of the box to remove the sheets easier.  Other than that, these sheets do a great job for the price.  I would definitely recommend and purchase.</li>
    <li> I go to work by walking everyday and when I arrive at my office my face looks already like sweaty  because of the hot weather. It is very convenient that you receive two packages, I left one in my office and the other one at home or in my purse. It is very easy to use them, and the size is perfect for my T zone. As you can see in my before/after picture they really work. No more oily face at work, meetings, pictures, etc.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It helps my skin from being oily. Just pat it on your face and do not rub onto your face so it won&#x27;t mess up your make up. One blotting paper is good enuff already and you&#x27;d instantly look fresh and feel fresh.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily, especially when I spend long time beside my computer, I can strongly feel this when I touch my face. When I received this blotting paper, I tried at once. It really works.It makes me feel more comfortable, and no more shine at the same time. I love this.</li>

    <li> It is effective on absorbing the oil on my face. Very convenient to carry on with you in your wallet. On the package, it offers a 20% off promo code for next purchase. Not bad at all since it is offered to me for free to try out. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Free sample from amazing deals group. fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The color of this blotting paper is white. I used pink ones and blues one in another brand. White looks very clean. It touches soft and textured. It absorbs oil very fast and won&#x27;t ruin the makeup. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Nice try and nice experience for day by day.</li>
    <li> Love love love!  Worked exactly as blotting papers should.  Did not have to remove my daughters makeup (competition dancer), to clean up her face.</li>
    <li> I will start off my review by saying I got this at a deep discount in order to review the product.  I tried this out, but I am not seeing any signs of this working.  I don&#x27;t see anything on the paper.  I can feel a bit of difference on my face, but not enough compared to other brands.  So, for me, this is a no-go.</li>
    <li> Imagine this, you are getting ready for the biggest day of your life. You have your makeup just perfect and all is right in the world. Now, it is time to take photographs and you look in the mirror to make sure the makeup is just perfect still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh no! Your face is glowing and not in a good way. You have shiny face! What to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you can do is grab one of these wonderful little Luxury Day by Day blotting papers and make things ok again.  Just one of these little papers is all you need to remove excess oil and shine from your face in an instant. They really do work!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe me? Well, I tested them out on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly had no idea I even had oil on my face. Believe me, I was shocked, but I also know they work and work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These come in two packs with 100 premium sheets each. I think they are worth it if you truly want to be photo ready. Also, don&#x27;t let the smallness of the packaging fool you. This is a good size to throw in your purse or pocket book to be readily available as any needs arise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are you waiting for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I purchased this product with a code off .  The views expressed here are 100% my own and may differ from yours. ~Naila Moon</li>
    <li> Love these blotting sheets! I keep them in my purse so I can use them during the day is I need them.</li>
    <li> Got these to test them out, and they actually work well. They are easy to keep in your purse let alone your pocket if your someone that doesn&#x27;t carry a purse. They are very convenient.</li>
    <li> I have always had oily skin and wished I knew of something that I could stick in my purse for quick touch-ups. These sheets are definitely small enough to fit in my purse, but I&#x27;m not sure I will buy them again. They are basically tissue paper. Once I set one on my nose ore cheek, it&#x27;s done. There is nothing to absorb the oil, and you quite literally end up with a wet paper and it get&#x27;s on your fingers. I had better luck with the little packs of tissues I was keeping in my purse.</li>
    <li> My face tends to get a bit oily in some places, especially when the weather is warmer. I&#x27;ve used a regular tissue to dab the shine but it takes the makeup right off. Then you have to re-apply your makeup and it&#x27;s a pain to do. The Day by Day Facial Blotting Papers are really so much better than a regular tissue. These blotting sheets come in a package with 100 sheets to last a long time. You actually get 2 packages of sheets for a total of 200 sheets per order. The sheets are thin but ultra strong to do the job. I love how they work so well and take away the extra shine, without ruining your makeup. I received complimentary product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic!  I work in an office with less than ideal ventilation.  Even though my skin tends to be on the dry side, after a few hours at work, there is a slightly greasy shine on my nose, chin and forehead.  It is gross and happens regardless of what make-up I use or what moisturizer I use under my make-up.  Before, I had to either live with an oily-looking face, to put powder over top of the oil (not pretty!), or to wash off my make-up and the oily sheen, and then reapply my make-up (way to time-consuming and embarrassing to do at work).  I agreed to try these blotting sheets because the seller offered me a discount on them to try them out and provide the seller with my honest opinion about their product.  But knowing what I know now about how well these work, I would have bought them without a discount (and will in the future).  I&#x27;ve used blotting papers or facial tissue in the past, but these papers work better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.  I now am able to blot my face a couple of times a day at work (discretely) and these sheets completely soak up the oil on my face without taking off ANY of my make-up.  I now can just blot and go...without so much as a make-up touch-up (okay...maybe a lipstick touch-up).  Also, I am noticing that I am having none of the blemishes on my chin or around the edges of my nose that I had been getting before I started using these sheets.  I would definitely recommend these blotting sheets for anyone who has a tendency to get a little oily on their face during the day, and doesn&#x27;t want to have to reapply their make-up and/or wash their face in the middle of the day.</li>
    <li> I find these effective and economical. I occasionally use two, but that would be on an exceptionalyl oily day. I find them a slightly different material than other brands, but equally as effective.</li>
    <li> I received these as a promotional and they arrived today. With temperatures in the 100s already, it is a treat to have a handy product to  keep my face from feeling and looking oily.  The product is a perfect size and the packaging makes it handy for purse or pocket.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR OILY SKIN,IF YOUR SKIN IS DRY YOU CAN STILL USE IT BUT IT WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN DRYER.</li>
    <li> Growing up, I was never really a “Girly Girl” so my makeup bag was always just Lip Balm, Mascara and Black Eyeliner…I missed out on some of the beauty products of convenience that my more makeup savvy counterparts were aware of that I wasn’t. I was offered the chance to try Day by Day Beauty’s Blotting Paper, I was curious, so I naturally accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I didn’t think it would be that absorbent…it reminded me of ordinary wrapping tissue paper, however, I was wrong! They are very absorbent. They come conveniently packed in a little cardboard envelope box that fits in your pocket or purse. They are scentless and have no additional powders so there is no residue left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use them on your face to remove oil and shine, blot away sweat without removing all of your makeup and even to removing excess lipstick. I know I’m a little late to this whole blotting paper party, but I’m sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially in the summer when my skin has the most oil! You can see and feel the difference!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and my skin looks shiny a lot because of it, especially when I wear makeup. So when I was asked to do this review, I was excited. Before I received these, I usually just use a tissue or toilet paper to blot my face. It&#x27;s effective a bit, but would smudge my makeup. I received 2 packages. I decided to actually keep one at work and then one in my purse for on the go and quick touch ups. For the price, you get a lot, a 100 sheets in each pack. The sheets themselves are thin and feel like a cross between wax and tissue paper. Surprisingly, they worked pretty well. They didn&#x27;t stick to my face and they didn&#x27;t smudge my makeup. A little makeup ended up on the sheet, but not a lot at all. I could literally see the oil from my face immediately on the sheet after using and my face wasn&#x27;t as shiny anymore. I was impressed. However, the sheets are small, which is good for throwing in my purse... but, I needed to use 2-4 sheets for each use, depending how oily my skin was. And, the packaging could be improved, It was very hard for me to just take one sheet out if needed. But, overall not bad and very convenient. I would buy these again. And, for the price, I would definitely recommend to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I like keeping a pack in my tote, and one at home. Great after a work out, a day at the beach, or around noon when the heat is high and my makeup begins to melt lol and when my skin gets oily. They work.</li>
    <li> I was able to get a discount for these and I feel that these will come in handy for when I need to blot excess oil. It worked fine so far and so I like this product.</li>
    <li> Worst blotting sheets I&#x27;ve ever tried. Doesn&#x27;t work well and the sheets tear very easily. I usually buy the Neutrogena blotting sheets, which I love, but I thought I would give these a try since it had high rating and a better price. Will not be reordering and will try to return the ones I have.</li>
    <li> These are an absolute staple in the hot, humid Texas climate. I love that so many come in this package as opposed to others you buy at the store. My only complaint is the packaging; it makes it hard to make sure you just get one paper at a time. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> Just your ordinary oil blotting sheets. Tough to get them out though.</li>
    <li> I like the way it soaks up all the oil. i do have to reapply a lil powder after i finsh blotting. but that is normal for me. I tend to be on the very oily side.i hate the fact that i do have to use 2 sheets at time. but i guess the price, i probably should be grateful. I will use the 2 packs and come back and update.</li>
    <li> Easy to carry in my purse and the compact size makes it easy to fit in even the smallest clutch or purse.&lt;br /&gt;My combination skin makes things harder after a long day wearing make up plus the normal Florida weather makes thing even worse. This is a most in my purse now!</li>
    <li> Really like these face blotting sheets!  My t-zone tends to get oily mid day and I use these to blot the oil from my face and it does work great.</li>
    <li> After using a different product that I bought later after this one I found the other ones better and easier to use then these. This product the sheets are really tough and you need to wipe to hard on the skin!! I don&#x27;t like that at all.</li>
    <li> I am a blotting paper junkie! I always have a few packages in my handbags. I love the packaging of Day by Day Beauty.  I love the &amp;#34;Hello,beautiful&amp;#34; message when you pop up the lid especially when you feel like a grease ball! I love that there are 100 sheets in each package! Great deal and you will never need to put more than one package in each bag. By now, you know how much I LOVE these sheets. Don&#x27;t think, just GET THESE! You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and super nice packaging!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the blotting papers, they are fantastic! While I am grateful to still have oily skin at my age (45) , the papers are wonderful to keep it under control throughout the day! Thank you for a great product and such nice service.☺</li>
    <li> This product is super affordable (a 2 for 1 deal) it was about 9 dollars I think, and one back of clean and clear blotting sheets ranges from 5-8 dollars and it has only 50 sheets, while you get 200 sheets for only a dollar more! The product itself works well, it removed most of the oil and grease (I am very oily especially during the summer) especially in my t-zone area and nose and sometimes even my cheeks. The reason it is four stars is because it might take two to three sheets, but it is still a great product and I would recommend to anyone. Also the little package it comes in is hard to open (I&#x27;m afraid I might break it) you can touch up during the day and it is very compact!</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying blotted paper for my oily face and I got to say  I&#x27;m in love with these thin sheets, they works really good and they clean the excess oil off my face and I even got my husband to give them a try, he is also happy.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin which tends to be oily in summer. By the early evening my make up starts to melt and gets shiny. These blotting sheets become very handy and useful in such situations. One little packet has 100 sheets and you get two in this deal. That&#x27;s lot of blotting sheets. I keep one at home and the other in my purse to use during the day. The blot away the oil and shine and leave my face matte. I also use them when I come back from my lunch time walk to take away little perspiration from my face. Easy to carry and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Wow these babies work like a charm! I have to say I was not only amazed kind of grossed out about how greasy my face was. These blotting papers have seriously cut down the greasiness and the shine of my face when I&#x27;m out and about. Really glad I have these in my purse at all times.</li>
    <li> I have had great luck with the blotting papers keeping my face from looking greasy! Oh so easy to use!!</li>
    <li> You get a lot of sheets for the price and these are comparable to other brands. I like that they are unscented as well.</li>
    <li> These plotting papers are very handy to have in your purse on the go. Sometimes in the middle of the day you start to feel a little greasy and these thing really help take care of that. There are other brands of these types of plotting papers but these have by far been my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love having a pack in my purse at all times! Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have perfect skin. So to deal with the shiney T-zone area, these work fabulously! Shine gone! Grease gone! And just toss the little paper away and I&#x27;m ready to move along with my day! Love them!</li>
    <li> These Blotting Sheets from Day by Day Beauty are a great purchase. I didn&#x27;t realize that I had so much oil on my skin until I tried them for the first time. They now have a permanent place in my purse for all those days where I am always on the go. They are easy and quick to use. I love the fact that they are fragrance free. This a great product and i will definitely be purchasing them again.</li>
    <li> These are amazing. They take away the oil and NOT THE MAKEUP WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT. I&#x27;m so amazed with how well they work. Love them</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, and for some reason I have never thought of purchasing blotting paper. I would just tap my face with tissue paper and brush away the little white balls / residue it leaves behind. Why didn&#x27;t someone tell me about this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With foundation on, very little (if any) makeup came off. It worked so well I decided to try it on my husband and as you can see from the picture, it helped him too. I&#x27;m keeping my blotting paper in my purse because I will be using these often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with the sheets is that I would sometimes end up with a torn sheet as I remove it from the case. They&#x27;re so delicate I have to take my time removing it from the package.</li>
    <li> these work great!! my face is always pretty oily at the end of the day and these strip my face of alll the oils!! awesome product and i love that there are so many and you can stick em in your purse!!</li>
    <li> Love these blotting sheets! Great for my oily t-zone and use it throughout the day to get rid of that &#x27;shiny&#x27; look. I got a great deal for these 200 sheets and for the quality of these blotting sheets, it is totally worth it! So here is my unbiased feedback; I have tried other blotting sheets before, but it does mess with my makeup. This one, however, only draws out oil and dirt from my face while leaving my face looking &#x27;fresh&#x27;! It is easier to put in my little pocket book and whenever I need a &#x27;touch-up&#x27;, I don&#x27;t need to take out my powder and brush, I&#x27;ll just get this bad boy out, apply it on (lightly press it down and do not wipe) and it will draw a lot of oil and dirt. I know this sounds yucky, but it&#x27;s pretty cool to see all that oil and dirt on the sheet. I highly recommend these blotting sheets!</li>
    <li> They work exactly as described. Great product and fast shipping . I recieved it within 48 hours. I did receive a discount, but this in no way influenced my review! I stand by it, this is A great product! I use it daily .</li>
