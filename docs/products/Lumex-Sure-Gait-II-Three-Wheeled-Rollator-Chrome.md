      <li>so this was a perfect substitute and the price was good too.</li>
      <li>ITS GREAT</li>
      <li>My four wheel walker works great out-of-doors but bumps doorways and is cumbersome in the house.  </li>
      <li>The rollator ha s been a great</li>
      <li>Great Product Great buying experience.</li>
      <li>Bought.this for my dad for outdoor use, said it worked great.</li>
      <li>, it is easier to get loaded in the car and works great for trips to the doctor and to grocery store.</li>
      <li>Great Product.</li>
      <li>, very nice.  </li>
      <li>WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT IM VERY SATISFIED ,</li>
      <li>have had peopls stop me and ask where to get one for themselves or a loved one.</li>
      <li>it folds real easy</li>
      <li>Product was as advertised and very easy to put together.&lt;br</li>
      <li>ALREADY HAVE A 4 WHEELER WHICH IS MORE STABLE AND HAS A SEAT</li>
      <li>and that sadle bag is better than a purse.</li>
      <li>Also as I&#x27;m sure people have pointed out</li>
      <li>I keep it to walk to my detached garage (especially with all the snow and ice this winter) and the three wheeler is perfect for the house, doctor&#x27;s office, when we dine out and when we attend the theater (folds so neatly).  </li>
      <li>The three wheels give you an easy glide and more controlled manuverability.</li>
      <li>She loves the idea but haven&#x27;t really put it to good use yet.</li>
      <li>Order rec&#x27;d very quickly.</li>
      <li>The unit arrived on time and in fine condition.</li>
      <li>The bag that&#x27;s attached is huge and holds a lot.</li>
      <li>Great too after surgeries.. Can&#x27;t say enough.  </li>
      <li>If I had only one walker it would be the 4-wheel; but having both is a great benefit.</li>
      <li>But it is VERY handy for short trips and for hauling in vehicles.</li>
      <li>It looks very nice and the fat wheels help go in different terrain.  </li>
      <li>and the pouch holds a blanket and tissues.. perfect for older people, even younger.  </li>
      <li>but all in all not a bad product</li>
      <li>Bought this 3-wheel walker as a second to my 4-wheel Carex walker (excellent) because I wanted one that was somewhat smaller and easier to handle when I took it into my car or a taxi or on a Manhattan bus.</li>
      <li>It is so versitile, and the cargo pouch is a great help for anyone that wants to be independent.</li>
      <li>However, with myself having rather a tall stature (6&#x27;1&amp;#34;) and light weight, with it being 3 wheeled the exterior application is somewhat unsafe.</li>
      <li>I will highly recommend this rollator to anyone that needs the additional aid in having upright abulation (walking) !!!</li>
      <li>He really liked the bigger wheels.</li>
      <li>(smile).</li>
      <li>Smile Whomever,&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Therefore I use this devise inside my home with great ease and support without being limited by normal variences of interior surfaces, including stuff on the floor.</li>
      <li>Great for small spaces at home, Doctors, and shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Less stable than 4 wheels but good for travel.</li>
      <li>Folds up nicely and will put in the back seat of a car easily, easy to put together, fits tall or short people.  </li>
      <li>- sure helped me to move around the house (especially the restroom - thank god).  </li>
      <li>Be aware moves much faster</li>
      <li>My husband was very reluctant about it at first but truly likes it now.  </li>
      <li>It can assembled and ready to go</li>
      <li>I got this for my wife and she really likes it.  </li>
      <li>but she gets around FAST with this.  </li>
      <li>The rest of the unit is very sturdy metal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I used it to walk back to the house, but me wife prefers I keep it clean</li>
      <li>if you are looking for a tough but good looking 3 wheeler</li>
      <li>/&gt;This unit appears to be very sturdy and solidly made with slightly larger wheels that the previous rollator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be advised that although the 3 wheeled models are smaller and easier to maneuver and fold when not in use, they may not be a good choice for all people with mobility problems, the 4 wheeled models are actually a bit more stable.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Easy to handle down grocery aisles as well as home.  </li>
      <li>I immediately contacted the supplier and within a couple of days they had replaced it with two new hand grips.</li>
      <li>I am going up to the finger lakes in new York</li>
      <li>This is a heavy duty, well made rollator that is easy to fold and put in the truck of my car.</li>
      <li>My mother loves this, it has the big wheels like the old Winnie Walker and is very sturdy.</li>
      <li>and he fixed me up</li>
      <li>Apparently the Winnie Walker does not make the ones with the big wheels and they are much lighter now which scared my mother</li>
      <li>I brought this walker for myself to steady me during my recovery from a recent illness.  </li>
      <li>Gave my 92- year-old relative a new lease on life being mobile once again.  </li>
      <li>: I am NOT a medical professional.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately when I turned  one of the plastic hand grips hard to make sure it was secure, it cracked.  </li>

    <li> Order rec&#x27;d very quickly. Product was as advertised and very easy to put together.&lt;br /&gt;Would do business again; NO PROBLEM!</li>

    <li> This rollater is terrific!  My husband was very reluctant about it at first but truly likes it now.  Its shape and size allows it to traverse in small spaces...&lt;br /&gt;no more banged up walls and entries!!!</li>
    <li> One wheel lock will not latch down properly and the company that sold it can not be contacted for parts.</li>
    <li> Bought this 3-wheel walker as a second to my 4-wheel Carex walker (excellent) because I wanted one that was somewhat smaller and easier to handle when I took it into my car or a taxi or on a Manhattan bus. The unit arrived on time and in fine condition. I assembled it in 5 minutes (I am 81) by myself.  Unfortunately when I turned  one of the plastic hand grips hard to make sure it was secure, it cracked.  I immediately contacted the supplier and within a couple of days they had replaced it with two new hand grips. The rest of the unit is very sturdy metal.&lt;br /&gt;I find the 3-wheeler a little less stable than my 4-wheeler but am now quite used to it.  I regularly walk (on city pavements) 2-3 miles several times a week with my 4-wheeler--but would not want to do that with this unit.  But it is VERY handy for short trips and for hauling in vehicles. If I had only one walker it would be the 4-wheel; but having both is a great benefit.</li>
    <li> Great for small spaces at home, Doctors, and shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SC</li>
    <li> The rollator ha s been a great, it is easier to get loaded in the car and works great for trips to the doctor and to grocery store.</li>
    <li> I brought this walker for myself to steady me during my recovery from a recent illness.  My four wheel walker works great out-of-doors but bumps doorways and is cumbersome in the house.  I keep it to walk to my detached garage (especially with all the snow and ice this winter) and the three wheeler is perfect for the house, doctor&#x27;s office, when we dine out and when we attend the theater (folds so neatly).  Several people have stopped me to find out where I brought it.  I used it to walk back to the house, but me wife prefers I keep it clean (smile).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband he likes it having some trouble with the handles but all in all not a bad product</li>
    <li> Smile Whomever,&lt;br /&gt;  This devise has been such a benefit for me in remaining relatvely independent. Although when ordering it I thought having larger wheels it&#x27;s use could be for universal use in mobility. However, with myself having rather a tall stature (6&#x27;1&amp;#34;) and light weight, with it being 3 wheeled the exterior application is somewhat unsafe. For me, independant balance without other influence (wind or grade) is essential. Therefore I use this devise inside my home with great ease and support without being limited by normal variences of interior surfaces, including stuff on the floor. I will highly recommend this rollator to anyone that needs the additional aid in having upright abulation (walking) !!!&lt;br /&gt;BTW: I am NOT a medical professional.</li>
    <li> It looks very nice and the fat wheels help go in different terrain.  It is very sturdy for my son who has cerebral palsy and needs to lean on it heavily.</li>
    <li> I had a hip put in ten years ago when the and I just had another hip put in a couple months ago and I got rid of my three wheel walker years ago and they are hard to find  so I found disen on line see I had a therapist come over and try to get me to walk with a big clumsy walker. I have installed a claxon air horn on the walker and for night walks I have a headlight  it folds real easy and I put it in my back seat. and that sadle bag is better than a purse. plus my back when out and I goes to a chiropractor and he fixed me up then I whent to an accupunture ist and she was alright but I found an accupunture machine that uses batteries and I order 2 for 50 dollars and 4 four 7.50 these accupunture machines are lectric her accupunture was from the old scool and when the accupunture units arrive I will bring one down there and see what she can dew with it and show me the meridians to hit plus I am going up to the finger lakes in new York they have a scool for acupunture</li>
    <li> Wish it had a tray and it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Bought.this for my dad for outdoor use, said it worked great. He really liked the bigger wheels. He has one with smaller wheels for inside the house. Also by using 2 of these he does not track in stuff from outside.</li>
    <li> Great Product. It is well made and sturdy. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she really likes it.  It can assembled and ready to go, very nice.  I am only giving it four stars because it did not come with a manual explaining how to adjust the brakes as they wear.  The piece of paper that came with the rollator, said to contact the local dealer/distributor if the brakes need adjusting.  I can not find a dealer or distributor for this product after searching the internet by product name.</li>
    <li> THE LUMEX IS VERY GOOD FOR GETTING IT IN AND OUT OF A CAR .PRIMARY REASON&lt;br /&gt;FOR THE PURCHASE .I ALREADY HAVE A 4 WHEELER WHICH IS MORE STABLE AND HAS A SEAT</li>
    <li> This is a heavy duty, well made rollator that is easy to fold and put in the truck of my car. My heavy duty 4-wheel rollator was too difficult for me. The bag that&#x27;s attached is huge and holds a lot. I also use this in the house.</li>
    <li> Would recommend for anyone that needs to have mobility in HOME or in Doctor offices.  Folds up nicely and will put in the back seat of a car easily, easy to put together, fits tall or short people.  Bought for my mother-in-law and she is blind, diabetic, and neurpathy but she gets around FAST with this.  I have used it when my back went out and I couldn&#x27;t pick up or mover the other walkers - sure helped me to move around the house (especially the restroom - thank god).  Great too after surgeries.. Can&#x27;t say enough.  I bought a water bottle holder to go with this and she takes it everywhere. and the pouch holds a blanket and tissues.. perfect for older people, even younger.  parking breaks too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom. She loves the idea but haven&#x27;t really put it to good use yet. We&#x27;ll see</li>
    <li> Just what I needed!  Easy to handle down grocery aisles as well as home.  Be aware moves much faster then the 4 wheeler.</li>
    <li> WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT IM VERY SATISFIED ,ITS GREAT ,THANK U</li>
    <li> Gave my 92- year-old relative a new lease on life being mobile once again.  Maybe I&#x27;ll purchase another one in a different color, for the weekends  !</li>
    <li> Sturdiest walker I&#x27;ve seen, also the arms can be adjusted to any height/direction since they don&#x27;t have holes in them and are held in place by tightening clamps. One thing is I&#x27;m 6 foot and it&#x27;s definitely at it&#x27;s height limit with me. Also as I&#x27;m sure people have pointed out if you lean backwards you will go flying onto your back, but that seems to be an issue with all the 3 wheelers.</li>
    <li> Less stable than 4 wheels but good for travel.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this, it has the big wheels like the old Winnie Walker and is very sturdy. She likes it because she can get in and out of smaller spaces unlike the 4 wheel walkers.  Apparently the Winnie Walker does not make the ones with the big wheels and they are much lighter now which scared my mother so this was a perfect substitute and the price was good too.</li>
    <li> This walker has changed my life. It is so versitile, and the cargo pouch is a great help for anyone that wants to be independent. The three wheels give you an easy glide and more controlled manuverability. It folds to a few inches for storage and transport, it fits easy behind my front seat.&lt;br /&gt;I have had peopls stop me and ask where to get one for themselves or a loved one. Great Product Great buying experience.</li>
    <li> The item description is a 4-wheel walker with a padded seat...not the 3-wheel walker which, by its design, cannot offer seating.</li>
