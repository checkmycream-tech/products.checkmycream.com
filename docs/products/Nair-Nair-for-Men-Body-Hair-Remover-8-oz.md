      <li>Great - As advertised</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the kind you buy</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any more problems.</li>
      <li>smells like burning.....  :)&lt;br</li>
      <li>that has the handle on top you push</li>
      <li>Love.</li>
      <li>Good product, works fast and well</li>
      <li>burning, I was sure to have it wiped clean (no rubbing) before I hopped in the shower for a rinse.</li>
      <li>It worked really well, and it was wicked handy to me.</li>
      <li>container is only good for about three to four applications, but did not need to reapply for a week.</li>
      <li>Did a good job on removing back hair.</li>
      <li>product well worth the money</li>
      <li>Very upset!</li>
      <li>Next day I did it again for 12 minutes and more hair came off again with no stinging.  </li>
      <li>It was my first time using anything like this.</li>
      <li>I received the product and gave it a first use.  </li>
      <li>BTW, I didn&#x27;t think I had sensitive skin and don&#x27;t easily sunburn or get rashes or the like, but for some reason, this product really did a number on me.</li>
      <li>I order this product from Amazon because it is far more effective than the newer version of the same product sold in stores that now only comes in a pump dispenser.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never once been burned by this product and I have used pretty much everywhere on my body, yes, everywhere.</li>

      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Visible new growth within 3 days.</li>
      <li>Leaves you smooth as silk down there.  </li>
      <li>Guess it depends if you have sensitive skin or not.</li>
      <li>It sounds like it doesn&#x27;t burn others and may work well for them, but if you have sensitive skin, watchout.  </li>
      <li>I finally switched to Veet Sensitive Formula</li>
      <li>However, the kind with the handle on top is horrible.</li>
      <li>as in taking a hot shower would hurt for a few days.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This used to be my go to product for hair removal.  I used it for years, but the last few bottles have been problematic.  It wouldn&#x27;t remove all the hair, even leaving it on longer than recommended.  I finally switched to Veet Sensitive Formula and I haven&#x27;t had any more problems.</li>
    <li> I order this product from Amazon because it is far more effective than the newer version of the same product sold in stores that now only comes in a pump dispenser. This cream really does a terrific job without irritating my skin.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing.  I received the product and gave it a first use.  Left it on for 10 minutes and there was not burning, wiped off as suggested and then showered and patted dry.  It took a lot of hair off with no stinging sensation t all.  Next day I did it again for 12 minutes and more hair came off again with no stinging.  Finally on the third day I left it on for 15 minutes before whipping off and showering, still no stinking and bald as coot on my genitals, that is the reason I started at 10 minutes and worked up to 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Good product well worth the money, if using on genitals do what I did and work up to 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Good product, works fast and well</li>
    <li> Received product yesterday 29 June 2015. Pass due but did receive. Try already it&#x27;s a very good product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> be patient, it works. don&#x27;t over do it..</li>
    <li> Worked quit well, however an 8 oz. container is only good for about three to four applications, but did not need to reapply for a week.</li>
    <li> I tried this twice and left it on for the the maximum time and it still left a lot of hair.  I had to end up shaving anyway.  Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Great, it works like a razor. Follow the instructions</li>
    <li> I used it 4 times on my neck and never worked.&lt;br /&gt;Burned skin not hair.I followed directions..&lt;br /&gt;Waste of time</li>
    <li> smells like burning.....  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good product.</li>
    <li> got what i ordered and it was mailed to me quick.i have no complaints.im totally satisfied.i will continue to practice ordering</li>
    <li> Did a good job on removing back hair.</li>
    <li> Works like it says it does.</li>
    <li> Perfect . Worked 100%</li>
    <li> Bought at Walgreens. Stubble comes back next day - doesn&#x27;t last any longer than shaving. After using it, the effect was like a moderate sunburn pain-wise.. as in taking a hot shower would hurt for a few days. It chemically dissolves/burns the hair - the only problem is that the substances in the hair that it breaks down are also found in the skin. Don&#x27;t see any advantage</li>
    <li> It was my first time using anything like this. It worked really well, and it was wicked handy to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff for my husband to use. While it worked to get rid of the hair, it also left a nasty chemical burn on his skin. Won&#x27;t be using again, sadly.</li>
    <li> One of the chemicals in Nair is bioaccumulating.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for my hair type....</li>
    <li> Applied three times for 10-15 minutes. Does work slightly, but still have to follow with a razor. Plus it made my room smell terrible.</li>
    <li> Love. I don&#x27;t like the kind you buy that has the handle on top you push and it works in the shower. I&#x27;ve never once been burned by this product and I have used pretty much everywhere on my body, yes, everywhere. Never once been burned. It works every single time. Guess it depends if you have sensitive skin or not. However, the kind with the handle on top is horrible. I&#x27;ve been burned a few different times by it. I recommend this one, not the other.</li>
    <li> Burned me badly.  Be VERY careful with this product.  It sounds like it doesn&#x27;t burn others and may work well for them, but if you have sensitive skin, watchout.  BTW, I didn&#x27;t think I had sensitive skin and don&#x27;t easily sunburn or get rashes or the like, but for some reason, this product really did a number on me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t  work at all for me i left it on for the recommended time and still nothing</li>
    <li> Great value. Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Great - As advertised</li>
    <li> Worked great for slicking down this wholly mammoth&#x27;s back. 6-7 minutes of exposure was all it took.&lt;br /&gt;No burning, I was sure to have it wiped clean (no rubbing) before I hopped in the shower for a rinse. You definantly want an assistant for hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;Downside:&lt;br /&gt;Visible new growth within 3 days.</li>
    <li> This product does not remove hair.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used it on lower back hair that I cannot stand and by son used it on some stomach hair.  Worked great.  No rash or burn.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Leaves you smooth as silk down there.  I have never had any irritation from it.</li>
    <li> Why the hell is this so expensive now</li>
    <li> My skin was tortured.</li>
    <li> I like this. It removes my chest back and arm hair. I dunno why people complain about the smell. It supposed to give some smell. Hey it burns the hair what do you expect.</li>
    <li> Terrible! Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your money tried it several times and waited longer than recommend time hair still wouldn&#x27;t come off. Don&#x27;t buy this product trust me. Very upset!</li>
    <li> Tried to use this product on 3 different occasions, left it on for the specified duration the 1st time and it didn&#x27;t remove any hair at all... so when attempting it the 2nd and 3rd time I left it on for longer than the instructions stated with still no results. Never felt the tingle or burning some reviewers mentioned</li>
