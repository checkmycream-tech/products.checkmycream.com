### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>THIS IS THE BEST HAIR STRAIGHTNER</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s perfect but doesn&#x27;t work when your hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m VERY happy with this product!</li>
      <li>it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>its great!!!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t miss it, the best straightener you would ever have!</li>
      <li>I bought this hair straightener a week ago thinking it was a great straightener.</li>
      <li>Great straightener.</li>
      <li>I had to heat it on 25 to straighten my hair and it worked great, for about 4-5 months, then it burned out.</li>
      <li>This is a great iron for a starter, but will not do it like a stylist.</li>
      <li>They used to be a great spot to get good stuff</li>
      <li>I was so psyched to buy this straightener, and I loved it for like 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I love it !</li>
      <li>I LOVE Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Gold Pro Series!</li>
      <li>I think it just kind of creeped up on us without us noticing what was going on.</li>
      <li>My friend had bought the straightener and I fell in love, so I bought my own.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t use this tool for anything but sleek, straight looks and have a bottle of frizz serum handy, then this is a great product for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be saving for a better iron while praying that straightening AND curling my hair doesn&#x27;t leave it severely damaged.</li>
      <li>I love this straightener.  </li>
      <li>and you want this product keep saving and get a better one ....</li>
      <li>A Satisfied Customer</li>
      <li>, I was extremely pleased.</li>
      <li>the best part is that it only take about 5 minutes!</li>
      <li>I do not feel confident about my hair when stepping out of the house after using this product.</li>
      <li>I have heard that the newest Conair straightener is wonderful, and comes with a two-year warranty, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay again, if it did the same thing to me that this one did.</li>
      <li>and I think 10 yrs is a pretty good lifespan.  </li>
      <li>so easily considering i didnt use it every day.</li>
      <li>My friend introduced it to me just yesterday, and i went out and bought my own, it really really works!</li>
      <li>plus if you have fine hair like me, it gets caught in the plastic seams.</li>
      <li>When I straightened my hair for the first time with this straightener, it looked great; it was straight and shiny</li>
      <li>It was by chance that I purchased a curling iron in addition to the flat iron, and was able to successfully style my hair after wrapping my hair overnight and applying frizz control serum.     </li>
      <li>unless, of course, you enjoy being ripped-off...</li>
      <li>It did a fabulous job</li>
      <li>This VS182 straightener is just amazing, it really works on my hair.</li>
      <li>As I learned to use the iron, I got decently straight hair - but not as nice as the salon.</li>
      <li>cheap</li>
      <li>All my friends liked my flat iron better then there own and would come over just to use it and finally bought their own.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
      <li>it works ok the first couple of times</li>
      <li>but that is no longer true.</li>
      <li>I loved this flat iron!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty light and goes wherever I go.  </li>
      <li>It left my hair shiny and silky smooth, which is amazing since I have fine curly hair that gets very frizzy</li>
      <li>my hair is the frizzy curly/wavy coarse kind of hair..</li>
      <li>As soon as I got out of the salon, I went to buy a flat iron of my own - and ended up with this iron.</li>
      <li>I did not notice this right away</li>
      <li>the first time i had it for about 8 months.</li>
      <li>In retrospect, it does exactly what it claims to do, but nothing beyond that.</li>
      <li>I pulled my hair up in a pony tail because it was hot that day, by the end of the day my hair was flipping.</li>
      <li>Broke first time used..returned</li>
      <li>I decided to buy another, thinking that it was just a defect on the first.</li>
      <li>you will see that I am not wrong.</li>
      <li>The first 8 months were heaven.</li>
      <li>- wish I could find this exact model.</li>
      <li>It was easy to use, didnt pull my hair while I was straightening it, and heat up quickly as well as cooled down quickly.</li>
      <li>I had to go over each tiny stand many times and the whole job took over an hour.</li>
      <li>I am hoping this is just a problem with mine and not with this brand because I really did love the way it worked, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>and I loved it at first since it worked as well as the more expensive straighteners that cost 5 times as much.</li>
      <li>I would recommend the sedu it has gotten great reviews and is more expensive, but I think when it comes to straighteners you get what you pay for!</li>
      <li>To my dismay, I would spend a whole hour perfecting my hair, but I&#x27;d take a lap in my first period</li>
      <li>I know everyone has gotten used to shopping online because it is eay and always open, but I have to tell you that most of the things I have found on amazon are priced way to high.</li>
      <li>although sometimes I have the time in the morning to touch it up, and make it really straight.</li>
      <li>I also have very curly and frizzy hair</li>
      <li>but I like to wear is straight, the straightener smoothes out all of my curls</li>
      <li>My hair even stays straight after sleeping on it</li>
      <li>but this product made it  look unbelievably straight, shiny, AND soft!</li>
      <li>but i find i am scared to put it on a high temp</li>
      <li>But for those of you that just want to low priced one, this one is the hot ticket!</li>
      <li>I purchased the third one (despite what happened with the second one I had bought) because it was an affordable price, I liked the size, and when the second one I had did work it worked well.</li>
      <li>This is the first time in my life that my hair looks so straight, it only takes like 15 mins!</li>
      <li>It is reasonably priced and did not damage my hair... execpt for the ends (Although all flat irons break your ends, its just the price we pay for exposing so much hear to our hair)</li>
      <li>I chose this flat iron because it was the same brand as my last one, and I was overwhelmingly satisfied with its performance.</li>
      <li>This is the best you can get unless you want to spend an arm and a leg on the Chi straighteners or ones equal to them, and they are VERY expensive.  </li>
      <li>&quot; look with this flat iron, which is sadly exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Ladies, I&#x27;ve tried nearly every straightener on the market.  </li>
      <li>I guess since it started wearing off into my hair the ends are drying out from direct contact with the plates underneath.</li>
      <li>Getting up an hour earlier inorder to be at school in time was a hardship, but I would do anything for straight hair.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder-length, naturally wavy/curly hair that I straighten nearly every day.  </li>
      <li>Needless to say, you won&#x27;t be able to produce that \\&quot;fresh from the salon\\</li>
      <li>i bought this flat iron because i ahve very thinck, wavy course hair.</li>
      <li>and it doesnt get hot enough for it to actually straighten your hair.</li>
      <li>with in the first 4 days and only 3 uses my bottom plate was already flaking ...it catches your hair and the only to get it out is to pull which does hurt ....</li>
      <li>Less than two months later, my straightener has huge exposed sections of metal.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair that is pretty thin, so I needed something that would straighten while being very gentle.  </li>
      <li>With my previous flat iron, I could straighten and style my layered hair at the same time, which significantly cut the amount of heat and damage my hair had to endure.</li>
      <li>With this straghtner, I can let my hair dry normally, and then use it to strighten out my curls....</li>
      <li>I have a smaller product from the same manufacturer and it&#x27;s also doing the same thing -- I&#x27;d highly recommend against this product.</li>
      <li>As a teenager with medium length, THICK, very curly hair, I have always wanted straight hair.</li>
      <li>My old flat irons were more expensive but lasted over a  year.</li>
      <li>All my friends raved about this straightener so since my other straightener died, I needed a new one.</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t get discouraged if you haven&#x27;t had luck with other flat irons; this staightener will be the last one you buy!</li>
<li> Used this straightener for a long time, almost a year.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i bought this and it does not work. it takes forever for it to heat up and it doesnt get hot enough for it to actually straighten your hair. plus if you have fine hair like me, it gets caught in the plastic seams. it was the absolute worst purchase ever!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener.  My hair is really thick and took a long time to straighten with other flat irons that I have bought in the past.  With this straightener I find that I don&#x27;t even use the highest heat settings (I leave it on about 10 out of 25) and my hair straightens in a short time.  I also have very curly and frizzy hair but I like to wear is straight, the straightener smoothes out all of my curls and I find that after I use the straightener my hair is no longer frizzy.  I bought this straightener about 3 months ago and have used it just about everyday since.  Even though I use the straightener almost everyday I don&#x27;t find that my hair is dry or course.  My hair even stays straight after sleeping on it although sometimes I have the time in the morning to touch it up, and make it really straight.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this straightener after reading through all the comments. My hair is wavy, dry, and thin, I&#x27;ve used couple of other straighteners before but they didn&#x27;t work and even make my hair worse. This VS182 straightener is just amazing, it really works on my hair. This is the first time in my life that my hair looks so straight, it only takes like 15 mins! I&#x27;m grateful to those who left comments here! Don&#x27;t miss it, the best straightener you would ever have!</li>
    <li> This is the only straightener I have found that works for me and I can only find it through this buyer.  Thank You!  I love it !</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that is pretty thin, so I needed something that would straighten while being very gentle.  This product does just that on setting 5.  I don&#x27;t have any split ends and my hair hasn&#x27;t \\&quot;fried.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m VERY happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I previously rated this product, and I am now having some second thoughts on it. It worked quite well as some one else said, for 4-5 months. Now the coating has started to chip off, and the it&#x27;s been ripping my hair out. ouch!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener TWO times..the first time i had it for about 8 months. My friend had bought the straightener and I fell in love, so I bought my own. The first 8 months were heaven. I straightened my hair all the time. Then, at 8 months, one of the plates stopped working! For a while i used it, but it took forever, and didn&#x27;t straighten my hair well at all. I decided to buy another, thinking that it was just a defect on the first. I bought the other and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as I had remembered! In fact, it stopped heating up all together within 3 months!! Another friend of mine bought this same straightener and it caused problems for her as well. We have both decided against buying this one again, obviously, and I would reccommend you do, too. I have heard that the newest Conair straightener is wonderful, and comes with a two-year warranty, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay again, if it did the same thing to me that this one did. DON&#x27;T BUY IT! unless, of course, you enjoy being ripped-off...</li>
    <li> I loved this flat iron! It is reasonably priced and did not damage my hair... execpt for the ends (Although all flat irons break your ends, its just the price we pay for exposing so much hear to our hair) All my friends liked my flat iron better then there own and would come over just to use it and finally bought their own. But after 8 months it just burned out. This is my 3rd different flat iron that has burned out, so i am going to finally upgrade to an expensive salon one. But for those of you that just want to low priced one, this one is the hot ticket!</li>
    <li> I have gone through 3 of these straighteners (i know, you think I would have learned!) however, my first one was lost, my second one stopped working in a matter of months, and the third one stop working in less than a month!! I purchased the third one (despite what happened with the second one I had bought) because it was an affordable price, I liked the size, and when the second one I had did work it worked well. Unfortunately in a matter of a few weeks one of the plates burned out so only one side works (causing obvious problems). I would recommend the sedu it has gotten great reviews and is more expensive, but I think when it comes to straighteners you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> She said wao!!!, it&#x27;s perfect but doesn&#x27;t work when your hair it&#x27;s weet...</li>
    <li> I LOVE Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Gold Pro Series! The VS182 Performs like a pro! I got the hairstyle I had been wanting and the unit heats up superfast. Worth every penny if not more! If you can get one for $25-$30 pick one up, You&#x27;ll be AMAZED!     A Satisfied Customer</li>
    <li> I bought this product in September of 2003 and I loved it at first since it worked as well as the more expensive straighteners that cost 5 times as much. It left my hair shiny and silky smooth, which is amazing since I have fine curly hair that gets very frizzy if I do not use a lot of styling products. But now after 3 months and only 10 or so uses the gold coating is wearing off off. I guess since it started wearing off into my hair the ends are drying out from direct contact with the plates underneath. I did not notice this right away so I am not sure when it started. I am hoping this is just a problem with mine and not with this brand because I really did love the way it worked, especially for the price. I am going to try and get a replacement from the manufacturer if I can find the warranty information, but unfortunatley I threw out the packaging with manual. :(</li>
    <li> I was so psyched to buy this straightener, and I loved it for like 2 weeks. Then I noticed that the ceramic coating on was starting to come off. Less than two months later, my straightener has huge exposed sections of metal. Worse yet, the manufacturer (Helen of Troy) will only exchange it for a new one-- which will take at least 3 weeks and simply give me yet another faulty product. I have a smaller product from the same manufacturer and it&#x27;s also doing the same thing -- I&#x27;d highly recommend against this product.</li>
    <li> As a teenager with medium length, THICK, very curly hair, I have always wanted straight hair. Blow drying and products made my hair worse, so when I finally had my hair professionally straightened for a dance, I was over joyed! As soon as I got out of the salon, I went to buy a flat iron of my own - and ended up with this iron. As I learned to use the iron, I got decently straight hair - but not as nice as the salon. I had to go over each tiny stand many times and the whole job took over an hour. Getting up an hour earlier inorder to be at school in time was a hardship, but I would do anything for straight hair. To my dismay, I would spend a whole hour perfecting my hair, but I&#x27;d take a lap in my first period p.e. class, and it would be frizzy again. Sometimes, just walking from my car into the school with our Washington foggy mornings would bring back the curls. Finally, my iron starting slowly dying after about six months. When I think about the hours I&#x27;ve spent infront of my mirror ironing my hair - and the imperfect and sort-lived results of this iron, I am disapointed. I have a Sedu iron coming in the mail soon.</li>
    <li> with in the first 4 days and only 3 uses my bottom plate was already flaking ...it catches your hair and the only to get it out is to pull which does hurt ....it works ok the first couple of times but i find i am scared to put it on a high temp cuz i dont want it to flake so if you have 30$ and you want this product keep saving and get a better one ....this product is not worth your time</li>
    <li> Ladies, I&#x27;ve tried nearly every straightener on the market.  This is the best you can get unless you want to spend an arm and a leg on the Chi straighteners or ones equal to them, and they are VERY expensive.  I have shoulder-length, naturally wavy/curly hair that I straighten nearly every day.  This straightener has cut my styling time down considerably and truly makes it stick-straight.  Its ceramic plates cut down on hair breakage as well.  Don&#x27;t get discouraged if you haven&#x27;t had luck with other flat irons; this staightener will be the last one you buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener a week ago thinking it was a great straightener. All my friends raved about this straightener so since my other straightener died, I needed a new one. My hair is thick, and extremely wavy, I straighten my hair almost everyday. When I straightened my hair for the first time with this straightener, it looked great; it was straight and shiny, I was extremely pleased. I pulled my hair up in a pony tail because it was hot that day, by the end of the day my hair was flipping. The next day I straightened it again and the same happened. I am dissappointed in my purchase, but hopefully I&#x27;ll make use of it somehow.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST HAIR STRAIGHTNER IVE EVER USED! My friend introduced it to me just yesterday, and i went out and bought my own, it really really works! i usually have really frizzy and poofy hair but this product made it  look unbelievably straight, shiny, AND soft! i would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron for a starter, but will not do it like a stylist. I have had it for at least 2 years so it will last also. The price is a little bit to high I only paid $ 19.99 for it at Walmart.I know everyone has gotten used to shopping online because it is eay and always open, but I have to tell you that most of the things I have found on amazon are priced way to high. They used to be a great spot to get good stuff cheap but that is no longer true. I think it just kind of creeped up on us without us noticing what was going on. Please folks go back out in to the world and start looking you will see that I am not wrong.</li>
    <li> I had used a few straighteners, and none compared to the really expensive professional hair straighteners.  This one does!  I normally dried my hair with a hair drier, but constantly got split ends earlier than I should have been getting them.  With this straghtner, I can let my hair dry normally, and then use it to strighten out my curls....the best part is that it only take about 5 minutes! It&#x27;s pretty light and goes wherever I go.  It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> omg!! i bought this straightener last november...its great!!! it works perfectly. my hair is the frizzy curly/wavy coarse kind of hair..but this straightener worked. it only takes about 15-20 minutes as opposed to 40-45 minutes. i definetely think u should buy this!!!</li>
    <li> nope. Broke first time used..returned</li>
    <li> i bought this flat iron because i ahve very thinck, wavy course hair. I had to heat it on 25 to straighten my hair and it worked great, for about 4-5 months, then it burned out.My old flat irons were more expensive but lasted over a  year.It made me mad that it burned out so easily considering i didnt use it every day.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with long, chemically relaxed hair. As a full-time undergraduate student, I cannot afford to visit the salon on a weekly basis. I purchased this flat iron on a whim at the market because my previous flat iron had recently shorted out (it was an older model with no swivel cord). I chose this flat iron because it was the same brand as my last one, and I was overwhelmingly satisfied with its performance. I cannot say the same for this product.     In retrospect, it does exactly what it claims to do, but nothing beyond that. With my previous flat iron, I could straighten and style my layered hair at the same time, which significantly cut the amount of heat and damage my hair had to endure. Any attempts to style my hair were underwhelming to say the least. After using the flat iron, my hair looked fizzy and unkempt, and even a bit damaged. Any curls I managed to produce looked undefined and limp. It was by chance that I purchased a curling iron in addition to the flat iron, and was able to successfully style my hair after wrapping my hair overnight and applying frizz control serum.     Needless to say, you won&#x27;t be able to produce that \\&quot;fresh from the salon\\&quot; look with this flat iron, which is sadly exactly what I needed. I do not feel confident about my hair when stepping out of the house after using this product. If you don&#x27;t use this tool for anything but sleek, straight looks and have a bottle of frizz serum handy, then this is a great product for you. While I am not happy with its results, it will have to do for now. I&#x27;ll be saving for a better iron while praying that straightening AND curling my hair doesn&#x27;t leave it severely damaged.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for 10+ years and it has just now kicked the bucket.  It did a fabulous job and I think 10 yrs is a pretty good lifespan.  I am looking to replace since it stopped heating and the ceramic is starting to flake off - wish I could find this exact model.</li>
    <li> Used this straightener for a long time, almost a year. It was easy to use, didnt pull my hair while I was straightening it, and heat up quickly as well as cooled down quickly. Great straightener.</li>
