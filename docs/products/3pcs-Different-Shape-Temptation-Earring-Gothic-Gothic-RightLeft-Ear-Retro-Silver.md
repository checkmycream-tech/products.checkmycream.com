<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect these to be made out of good material. Really showed me and they fit perfect. Every piece is very detailed to. Can easily describ from a disrance</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Can&#x27;t get ear ring to stay on ear.would not recommend anyone purchase this item</li>
    <li> SAME THING HERE THEY WONT FIT ANY EAR AND THE SNAKE ONE THE BUTT OF IT WONT STA ON SO U CANT WAER IT AND THATS THE ONLY ONE THAT DID FIT JUST CHEAP STUFF DONT WASTE UR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS STUFF</li>
    <li> the dragon that goes into your ear doesnt have a hook on it so it doesnt stay on my ear other that that i love it</li>
    <li> Daughter loves these.  Gets compliments.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good quality considering what you paid for them. They look good and have lasted so far. kinda small though. And I wanted them for my right ear and only one was for the right, two were for the left</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price, these aren&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I believe I ended up waiting MONTHS for these to arrive. When they finally did show up, they were in a tiny envelope with no bubbles or padding. I&#x27;m surprised they were all in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the ear cuff one (on the bottom in the pic) was impossible to wear. There was no way for it to stick on comfortably. I threw it out. Secondly, the dragon piece (top left) was incredibly uncomfortable. The posts are a lot shorter than show, and are just glued on with hot glue. The angle at which the post stuck out made it impossible to wear without it being incredibly uncomfortable. I also threw this one out. The last one was the only decent piece, the snake (top right). It had the same problems as the dragon piece, but luckily I was able to gently bend it to the correct shape. The snake did sometimes fall off, but I was able to wear it for an evening without having to worry. It was, however, very heavy. I have no clue what the metal composition is, so I would be cautious about them either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they&#x27;re garbage. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I love this! But I can&#x27;t seen to get the dragon cuff on my ear..... But the other two are fantastic!!! I wear them a lot! You can&#x27;t really wear them when you have long hair though, so I just put my hair up to wear them.. That also exposes them more so people can see it. I am really satisfied with them!!</li>
    <li> great, but the one of them the wrap around dragon doesn&#x27;t quite fit. all in all its great.</li>
    <li> There nice and cute. Just one of the earrings was a little too small. I think it was the snake. But over all they look really cute.</li>
    <li> They came almost two weeks early, and they&#x27;re awesome! Since they were so cheap, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. They are surprisingly good quality, something I would have spent $15+ on at the mall. The dragon isn&#x27;t an earring though like I was expecting, more like a large cuff, and though it doesn&#x27;t fit my ear, it&#x27;s still really neat. The other two fit perfectly, and don&#x27;t fall off easily. Totally worth the price, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> For the price these earrings are okay. They came before the estimated delivery time which is a plus. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on them and they hold up pretty well on my ears.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much for shipping these to me in such good timing. Items were just as pictured and so cute for the price.</li>
    <li> The snake and the wingless dragon didn&#x27;t fit and the dragon with wings was way to small and very heavy. It&#x27;s impossible to get it to stay on . Not worth the money spent .</li>
    <li> #theycutethough #theycheapthough</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I bought it</li>
    <li> Only think in con is the time to get to U.S. but for the price and free shipping it is worth it, My wife love them all.</li>
    <li> Eat pieces did not fit and some pieces were bent when I received the package.  Would not recommend on buying.</li>
    <li> The metal irritated my ear.  Also, the product did not fit.  Two would not stay on my ear because they were too large and one because it was too short.  Even for the price it was a waste of my money.  It may work for someone else, but for me it was a no go.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for Christmas.  They are going to someone who really likes&lt;br /&gt;dragons so hopefully they will enjoy them.  I&#x27;m not sure how well they&lt;br /&gt;will stand up to wear since they seem sort of flimsy  but we will see.</li>
    <li> Liked the look of these and were a good price so I thought, why not? Please don&#x27;t waste your time or money on these. They are just awful.</li>
    <li> they lack good detail/facial shaping and the end tail segment is a bit of a pain, but they are rather adorable still.</li>
    <li> didnt seem to fit at all the picture online looked way better then the product itself but cant complain for the price wouldnt buy them again thats for sure</li>
    <li> they have so much potential. They are somewhat cheap looking and absolutely impossible to keep on your ear and the post and backs to the snake and dragon are small and very uncomfortable. But they are unique.</li>
    <li> They do not stay on your ear right</li>
    <li> not what I thought I brought them for myself but I gave them away to a friend and she dint like them they where to thin</li>
    <li> The snake is great and works perfectly.  However the Dragon with the piercing is made to fit a CHILDS ear, and the other Dragon keeps falling off no matter how i put it on, i may have just not figured the trick out yet so i still have hope for it.  Anywhose, 2 of them are extreme disappointments,  however the snake is still worth it.</li>
    <li> Okay so I love these ear rings they are beautiful. The only problem that I had is that one of the era rings hoop to hook to the ear broke off already maybe they should use something else to hold it in place. Though it kind of broke its still beautiful.</li>
    <li> They are small, much smaller than I expected. I have to fit these through the second hole in my ear to wear them, but if you don&#x27;t have multiple piercings or small ears- don&#x27;t buy these. The clip on dragons I cannot wear at all. Besides that, good for the price and I didn&#x27;t have any breaking issues like some others claim.</li>
    <li> Decent, but they don&#x27;t fit.  My ears are too small.</li>
    <li> They are great for small ears. Though for normal sized ears they need to be bigger. Very hard to keep them on.</li>
    <li> All three of these earrings were too big for my ears so I cant wear them. They are cute and worth the money I just wish they fit</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad buy, but they are a little dinky. They seem to fit my ears just fine, and shipment was earlier than i thought. I would recommend, but don&#x27;t expect high quality.</li>
    <li> when i tried to put them on it was difficult and would not stay on my ears. Had too give it away to my niece and sister, so at least it was not a total loss.</li>
    <li> Right now I only have one to rate because the seller sent defective earrings! Currently we are trying to work it out. They are asking for pics of the defective parts but not everyone has a digital cam! I only paid just over a dollar for these, and that&#x27;s just what i got, ONE working earring! The earring that works though is pretty heavy on the ear but looks GREAT if you can tolerate that weight!</li>
    <li> cheap, looks great.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t use myself but give as gift to people who helps me on vacation.</li>
    <li> This was exactly as described and my daughter was very happy with it. Shipping was very fast. Thank you. I will definetly come back to you for similar purchases.</li>
    <li> not only did i have to wait 6 weeks for this product to arrive (two weeks more than i was supposed to) but when i opened them (i bought two sets) 4 out of 6 were either broken or had missing pieces!!! Trying to find a bright side of things, I decided to at least try them on before writing a review: they didn&#x27;t fit, didn&#x27;t have enough support (i.e cuff, studs, etc) and left my ears a weird green color. These were supposed to be a matching gift to my best friend who loves dragons (Go Team Targaryen!!!) but after seeing and trying these out- i&#x27;ve decided not to. Bottom Line: if you want a set of dragon ear cuffs- spend your money somewhere worthwhile...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to wear the cuff one, but I think that&#x27;s my own fault. The dragon earring is a little small, so it either tugs at my ear hole or puts a bit of pressure on the top of my ear. I haven&#x27;t tried the snake one, but they all look beautiful.</li>
    <li> i got this on time and for the price 1.00 $ with free shipping it was worth the time it took i mean it was almost free! and it looks just like the picture</li>
    <li> Did not fit my ear well.  I never wear them.</li>
    <li> It came with all three ear pieces, and they were all in good condition. They all look really cool in your ears too.</li>
    <li> They are a waste of money and time. They didn&#x27;t fit and one of them came without a back. Also the one that didn&#x27;t have a... piercing kept falling off. The snake is hard to put on too.</li>
    <li> I love this! I love the way it looks and I think it adds wow to any outfit! Got mine really quickly too love nicEshop</li>
    <li> None really fit but then again i have big ears and they broke on my very fragile</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re wonderful! They gently bend so you can adjust them to fit your ear. Then cuff one hurts sometimes, but it could just be my ear.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality, they don&#x27;t fit and they hurt my ear, plus i can&#x27;t get them to stay on my ear and the backs keep detatching</li>
    <li> I like looks of it but not as much quality look as other jewelry I ordered looks like jewelry for a teen. I would not recommend for adult purchase but maybe to a teen or preteen person. I also did not like because would not mount to ear properly.</li>
    <li> If you purchase these to wear be ready for damaged pieces and pieces welded in the wrong spots. I did not buy them to wear, I purchased them to hot glue into hair accessories. One dragon is currently glued to a red rose pinup girl style hair clip and the other to a black rose. I gave the snake to my sister because I had purchased a matching one for myself.</li>
    <li> The snake one had a bent earring piece so couldn&#x27;t try that on. Then the dragon with the large wings didn&#x27;t fit but the other dragon fits and wears just right I love that one. It&#x27;s not worth the effort in sending back the defected ones I&#x27;m satisfied with the one that is wearable.</li>
    <li> So, when paying less than two dollars for these, I really didn&#x27;t expect them to be amazing. However, I was plesantly surprised. The two that required piercings fit perfectly and are very comfortable. The cuff one didn&#x27;t hold on too well to my ear and was rather uncomfortable, but it fit a friend who&#x27;s got slightly smaller ears perfectly. I had no irritation from the metal content and I have moderately sensitive ears, so whatever the makeup of the metals is, it&#x27;s not horribly objectionable. In short, an excellent buy for the price.</li>
    <li> they break very easy and don&#x27;t fit on any normal human ear. in my opinion it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
    <li> I loved these, I&#x27;m still learning how to put them on. You definitely need a mirror though. Great price and great quality! I love these earrings. Also, the smaller dragon one has an adorable little &amp;#34;gem&amp;#34; in it&#x27;s mouth, I didn&#x27;t notice that in the picture. Recommended to all.</li>
    <li> Lovely dragon ear cuffs/ earrings. These cam packaged in good shape, another place I ordered from put one in a mini manill aenvelope and the stud part was sticking out and bent at 90 degrees. So this was a much better choice to go with.</li>
    <li> One of the earrings snapped as soon as I put it on. The packaging was also terrible and bent one of them.</li>
    <li> these ear cuffs are a favorite of all my girls they wear them all the time and every where they go</li>
    <li> i really enjoy these earrings but theirs only one that actually fits on my ear and is really awkward when on because it constantly falls off my ear .</li>
    <li> Well...I knew these were not going to be wonderful...but, wow....2 were broken, and the other doesn&#x27;t work?! So, me personally....I wouldn&#x27;t order any of these again. Now someone else might just love them:)</li>
    <li> They are really cool designs, each animal looks awesome. But they don&#x27;t work. They don&#x27;t fit my ear, the backing will not fit on one of them. Which is a shame cause they look really cool. Even the clip on one, the clip part is very frail, and the arm of the dragon that holds on to your cartilage, is not positioned correct for me. They will not work.</li>
    <li> The pieces were of cheap plastic and most of them did not fit the ear right, so it wasnt very good</li>
    <li> The earrings are so big does not fit into the ear properly, 2 of them were broken, i do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product very poorly wrapped. They came bent. very easy to break. Cheaply made and very easy to bend and the dragon with the cuff came crooked.</li>
    <li> they came in on time estimated, were in an envelope from out of the country. I understand that the cost was not that much and I usually only buy cheap earrings incase I lose one. Now that being said two pair came in the post were bent and I am afraid to bend them back incase the post completely brakes. the backs on one of them was glued poorly and the glue was in the hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not impressed with the shipping or the way it was put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the designs are cute and as long as you don&#x27;t get real close you can&#x27;t see the cheapness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is one of the few items I actually purchased without reading the reviews and I will never make that mistake again no matter how cheap the price. Not worth the let down after they come in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I received an email from the company, they were sorry I was upset with my purchase and they fixed the problem. I appreciate a company that will fix issues.</li>
    <li> The two pierced ones are MOST EXCELLENT... however the very moment I took the dragon out of the packaging, i tried to slightly manipulate it to fit my ear.. (it was COMPLETELY ROUND and was shaped like No Ear ive ever seen...shaped VERY ROUND like a letter &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; rather than a regular &amp;#34;ear&amp;#34; shape that normally are much more egg or ovally shaped.. ) would have DEFINITELY given this a 5-star review based on just the first two though... if the 3rd hadnt broken completely in half...:-(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think they thought about what can happen to an envelope with fragile items in it can go through during shipping. I recieved the package with all the earing posts flattened. I very casrefully tried to bend it back and it broke. They need to send those in a box instead of an envelope.</li>
    <li> they all broke when i touched them...sad, i really wanted them too :( shame it didnt work out bah humbug</li>
    <li> Love the style but they were too small to wear which is a bummer. These were a gift to someone that likes dragons. I saw other writeups on this being a problem on sizing and I just took a chance they would fit. Not worth the cost of returning but not a lot of money wasted either. Buyer beware</li>
    <li> i havent it got it yet and it been a long timei wish i could gave it a 0 but i cant</li>
    <li> they did arrive on time. first set was not complete, poor job on pouring into mold, replacement set was missing ear cuffs. You get what you pay for, sometimes.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very cheaply made, so you get what you pay for on this. They don&#x27;t stay on, and the one with the cuff is nearly impossible to get on in the first place.</li>
    <li> These earrings (3 pcs Different shape Temptation Earring Gothic) were what I expected. Worth what I paid for them. Thanx.</li>
    <li> The pieces are not made well, and the dragon ear cuff is put together backwards so cannot be used as intended. I realize that they are &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; but they should still be put together correctly so that the items could be used.</li>
    <li> Ok, they are not made of silver, pewter or any other durable metal! But they don&#x27;t claim to be, either... It&#x27;s amazing how well they can fit a variety of COMPLETELY different ears, in both shape AND size! I don&#x27;t expect them to last very long, since you have to make minor adjustments to get them to &amp;#34;hold on&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, for the price, ANYONE could afford to wear them once and throw them away! I do believe that most of the pieces will hold up for at least a dozen wears or so! So well worth the $$!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you try them on WELL before you intend to go out (if possible)! Getting them to fit right, at least for a newbie like me, will leave your ears RED from all the on - off - adjust - back on... and so on! Plus; wearing them around the house while you get dressed and thru makeup, you will definitely KNOW if you&#x27;ve achieved a perfect fit! (Don&#x27;t want them slipping off or falling into your drink... splashing your amazing/expensive outfit! Or, *gasp* even worse; your hot DATE!) Watched it happen, I thought it was hilarious... They didn&#x27;t! lol ;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, not the best. One of the dragons were crushed and I couldn&#x27;t fix it so I had to throw that one away. The other two are fine the best one is the snake earring it looks great and fits very well. I personally think the wait was ridiculous it took about a month to get here so if you have patience then I would recommend it to you. I however got very frustrated waiting so long for my jewelry. Overall it is a decent product but still disappointed that one of the earrings were broken.</li>
    <li> These fit the ears nicely and look really awesome.  The only thing is the two that require a piercing seem to have loose backs.  The backs do stay on, but I worry about them.  Oh, and the posts on those two were bent when I got them, but it was easy to bend them straight.</li>
    <li> They only sent two of the earrings.  And they were very fragile.  My friend got a set also and as soon as he tried to adjust it a little the dragon without the large wing snapped in half.</li>
    <li> The snake and wingless dragon were fine and fit perfect on my ear, but the dragon with the wings was a lot more difficult to accommodate on my ear. I tried bending it to fit my ear and it nearly broke. I made it fit, but still its awkward and kind of loose. Overall, for the price, I do think its worth it.</li>
    <li> did not say on my ear.... and also the earring stick constantly keeps bending...not a good product</li>
    <li> These ear cuffs were made using hot glue. There were still stringy things coming off, and the hole that connects the two parts of the earring was so filled with hot glue I could hardly get the earring in. Also, the package they were mailed in was just a bubble envelope, and the stud part of the earring pierced through it and bent on 2/3 cuffs. Also, the cuffs are too short to fit around my ear, and there is nothing to hold them up. They are too heavy and dont actually have a &#x27;cuff&#x27; for th eear.</li>
    <li> The ear cuffs came in right on time.the ear cuffs are made very well and can be carefully adjusted to fit.but do be gentle when it is adjusted are it can bring.they staid right on my ears and I received many complements.they are priced perfectly</li>
    <li> i just got mine in the mail yesterday it was a good but for the price and quantity i got but they dont wrap around my ear like it looks that they would.</li>
    <li> One of the cuffs came in bent due to poor shipping packaging, tried to fix it and it broke right in half. I&#x27;m just glad it wasn&#x27;t the ones that went through the ear, i would have returned it if they were all damaged.</li>
    <li> These are very cheap made; one of them broke the first time I tried to put on my ears. They do not hold on ears so I ended up never wearing. Waste of time, at least they are cheap all the way.</li>
    <li> i loved all three of these when i first got them i even went and bought more for on of my friends but after a week of having these things one broke in half one had the clamp off and the other just hurt my ear when i wore it due to its odd shape i would suggest getting these from somewhere else because the one i bought for the danish exchange student broke to i was wondering why they were so cheep</li>
    <li> Not as good quality as they appear in the picture but for the price, it&#x27;s worth it. I have small ears do they fit pretty well.</li>
    <li> LOVE, very pretty and I love each one and how they are all different in wear. Was super excited for them to get here. Worth the wait.</li>
    <li> i just got this in the mail today. i am trying to put the big dragon on my ear and i can&#x27;t..it don&#x27;t fit at all. the cuff itself is attached wrong, like it&#x27;s reversed. the picture looks waaay cooler than the real thing. the snake does not fit either, noir does the small dragon. i guess it&#x27;s made for &amp;#34;child like&amp;#34; ears, not adults. oh well, i gues i got what i paid for...junk. it is a shame cuz i think the art work is beautiful.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll I got them on time but when i got them i took them out and i looked at them and the earring looked all messed up and only 1 fit my ear and The other 2 didnt and one was bent out of place</li>
    <li> The dragon with the wing was broken when I pulled it from the package, which is sad because that was the one I really wanted. I tried on the other dragon and it was way too small and I don&#x27;t have big ears by any means. Definate buyers remorse.</li>
    <li> Came in just as pictured. I love them! And it&#x27;s easy to put them on. You just have to know how your ear is shaped. Definitely my most favorite pieces of jewelry.</li>
    <li> These are cute, but they broke as soon as I bent them even the slightest bit to fit my ear. It&#x27;s too bad, because I liked them.</li>
    <li> I think this is an awesome product the only problem I had was with the dragon with the extended wing because it refused to grab on to my ear. It sometimes gets stuck to my hair but is easily untangled, other than that it was great, it even came earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> Obviously you get what you pay for, I don&#x27;t like the fact that it was not able to fit on my ear, i&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s made for larger ears although mines are pretty average but i got my boyfriend to try it and it slipped right off.. -_____- ....Do not buy....waste of money</li>
    <li> the dragons tail wont stay on the end fitting piece :( kinda disappointing but for the price they look very nice, just wish his tail would have stayed without having to buy super glue.</li>
    <li> The earrings arrived not packed very well. The earrings probes were bent, almost afraid to bend them back. Afraid they will break. Will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I got the earrings love them but wish they could be worn on either ear.  They only work on the right ear.  I&#x27;m still keeping them, I bought 2 pairs, thinking they would fit on both ears.  Now I have an extra one in case in breaks or gets lost.</li>
    <li> All three of the cuffs are different shapes and slightly different designs than the pictures you see here of the products. If anything, you just get cheaper looking versions with less detail and more shoddy work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving them, the one I was most excited about, the dragon cuff without the piercing, it was absolutely unwearable. The cuff was circular, not at all ear shaped, so there was absolutely no way it was going to fit me. Also while I was just trying to adjust it, the adjustable cuff part broke off. The whole cuff came really as more of a circle and it&#x27;s not even a bendable material so I couldn&#x27;t even try to make it work. This was EXTREMELY disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snake and dragon earring cuffs did fit though. Although the snake will literally look like it&#x27;s crawling into you ear rather than circling it. The head takes a sharp turn so that the head of the snake goes further across the ear rather than being on the outside edge. And this one is HUGE! it fits, but it&#x27;ll often come loose and I&#x27;ll have to fix it. So, don&#x27;t move a lot if you&#x27;re wear the snake cuff, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dragon earring cuff is also rather large, and definitely didn&#x27;t fit my ear like the one it this picture, it also comes loose quite a bit as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m not too disappointed. I figured these would be hit or miss. After all, I got three for about $1.50. Since then, I see the price has gone up and I would say: BUYER BEWARE! Don&#x27;t even bother buying them unless you want to wait a month and risk them not fitting yours ears, or even breaking. I&#x27;ll still wear the two earring cuffs, but I probably won&#x27;t wear them often since they fit so weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that&#x27;s what I get for being cheap though!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t line up right with anyones ear and broke easy while trying to put it on. is all junk is worth the price</li>
    <li> They are cool and everything but i cant wear them anymore because i got gauges. Also when i was gonna try them on it seemed like they were going to break. They in my option look better in the picture then they do in real life. So if i where you i wouldn&#x27;t buy them</li>
    <li> ARRIVED BROKEN, MISSING PIECES AND IT WAS VERY FLIMSY. DID NOT STAY ON EARS AT ALL.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS.</li>
    <li> chepley made but for the price u can complain these worked for what i needed arrived on time to the day</li>
    <li> it looks exactly like in the picture!!!! I have actually recommended my friends to buy this set because they absoluty loved it!!!!! I would actually order this same one again one day to give as a gift\^.^/</li>
    <li> They were neat little earrings, but very hard to work with and put in ear. Yes they are cheap, but I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> These look cool but they are too heavy and the one that is suppose to wrap around the ear does not fit at all.</li>
    <li> 2 out of the 3 were broken when received. was ordered for a christmas gift and is now to late to replace them.</li>
    <li> The first issue is that the earrings were delivered from China in a padded envelope, no box! One post was sticking out of the package upon arrival, the post of the second earring was bent flat against the earring and the ear cuff of the third earring was smashed flat! Even after we unbent the various pieces the large Dragon cuff did not fit on the ear properly. I would not buy from this supplier again!</li>
    <li> One of the earrings didn&#x27;t even come with a spike for me to put through the piercing in my ear.  On the second one the spike broke when i put it on.  I have one eating left.  This product is cheap I would have rather spent my three bucks on coffee</li>
    <li> These were  cheaply made and one of them arrived broken.  Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> They are really hard to get on ear they are right size just twisted weird but I just bought them for costume fun so very content for price.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for a friend. She said she loved them, and has worn a few times. I inspected them before I gave them to her, and the quality seemed pretty good for the value. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was that on some of them the edges seemed sharp, but if you are handy then you can file it down.</li>
    <li> I love them but the needle was bent when they arived but that was all right it was an easy fix.</li>
    <li> I love these. I&#x27;ve bought 2 so far. The only complaint is the first one came with one of the three earrings broken. For the price I just ordered another, kept the one I needed to replace and gifted the new ones. I really like the dragons especially. Awesome!</li>
    <li> do like these alot i gave a set to one of my friends and loved them&lt;br /&gt;one thing is that for 2 of them you must have your ears priced&lt;br /&gt;and the other one just raps onto your ear&lt;br /&gt;me on the other hand had a bit of a problem do to my gauges&lt;br /&gt;but i do like this alot&lt;br /&gt;hope this bit of info is helpful :)</li>
    <li> i like this jewery it is cool and cool to wear with my black outfits which is cool to have.</li>
    <li> Okay so I&#x27;m pretty sure I have normal size ears, and 2 out of 3 fit me really well (the snake and the dragon that go in your piercing). However, the dragon with the cuff is too small, and even if it wasn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think it would be secure.&lt;br /&gt;Still. the other two are great and for the price I have no complaints! I even ordered a second set because I have gotten so many compliments from my friends.&lt;br /&gt;The products look 95% like the picture and I definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I wear the snake one all the time, for the whole day, and I do not have redness/irritation/soreness in my ear. LOVE</li>
    <li> Great idea but when i got mine the back of the snake one was broken (fixed it myself no point in waiting forever for something i can do on my own)  the giant dragon (gold) fit OK but it needs possibly another grip where he sits his head or something. his arm could be flexible? that would work much better. the smaller silver dragon worked out pretty well when i put it in my top piercing spot but couldnt fit if i put it in my regular lobe. was far too small</li>
    <li> All 3 were broken before they arrived. I do not need them replaced because the future ones will meet the same fate. Material metal is very flimsy. Plus the sculpture of the design was poor craftsmanship. But for what I paid can&#x27;t expect more. It one of those you try your luck.</li>
    <li> None of them fit, one of them had gunk or glue or something so I couldn&#x27;t put the back onto one of the earrings. They were only $1.29 with free shipping, so whatever. But still. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> The two earrings that go through your pierced ear are perfect. But the cuff dragon earring broke and I could not figure out how to fit it on my ear. It was not fitting properly. I was very disappointed in it. Because that was the one I was most excited for.</li>
    <li> This product is indeed you get what you paid for . I would not recommend these to anyone. They are so cheep that they are not even made in the right angles to fit the ear. They broke in  the 5 minutes that I opened the package . They were a real disappointment.</li>
    <li> Two of the ear wraps fit perfectly fine and are very cute. The third bends my ear and makes it red and sore. It&#x27;s too heavy and to small for my ear, and I have really small ears.</li>
    <li> Broken and bent. And seems like it is made for a child&#x27;s ear it is so tiny</li>
    <li> It is great, I love all three of them, and they were artfully done.  Also, the price was amazing for the value.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my sons girlfriend. It did take some time to get here but i cant wait to see ehat she thinks of them!! I have no doubt she will love them! I dont know much about these kind of earrings but i know my daughter tried her best to get them from me!!lol!! They seem pretty sturdy but maybe if she wears them alot they may break. But if they do the price is so great ill have no problem getting her another set!! If you love dragons and want this style of earrings i highly recommened them! And ill be adding to my review as soon as i get to see how much she likes them!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if my ear is just weird or too small, but I just can&#x27;t get it to stay on my ear. The places where the earring goes through your ear isn&#x27;t glued well, but its easily fixed with Elmer&#x27;s or tacky glue, etc. It&#x27;s difficult to put on, let&#x27;s just leave it at that.</li>
    <li> They where as pretty as the pitchers slightly bent in post but was fixable! they are a good add on for everyday styles!</li>
    <li> these all ended up breaking befor ei could even wear them they r very cheaply made dont waste ur money</li>
    <li> They broke as soon as I tried them on. But they are nice, I can probably use them for a costume later on. Thank you though!</li>
    <li> They are easy and comfortable to wear</li>
    <li> They are two small for my ear and when I tried to stretched them it snapped in two. Poor quality and made for someone with small ears.</li>
    <li> Warning, they are for small ears! It was my fault for not measuring but other than that they came in good condition.</li>
    <li> The earrings have some sort of flaky metal paint and it comes off if you try to adjust the impossible angles these come in, to fit your normal size ear. They are much heavier then I expected as well. Sadly, unwearable.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, exactly as described and just as important works perfectly</li>
    <li> Only the thin dragon and the snake fit perfectly for my ear. The thicker dragon is weird to put on. It came earlier than expected.  It&#x27;ll take awhile for mw to be comfortable with it, but I like it.</li>
    <li> They hardly fit and they are too big I&#x27;m very disappointed. They should make different sizes or at least let people know.</li>
    <li> These are like described only not packaged well so they arrived bent. I wasn&#x27;t able to bend back into place without breaking them. Irritating. PLZ PACKAGE BETTER!! Won&#x27;t repurchase</li>
    <li> These earrings suck and hurts when you try to put them on</li>
    <li> the product came in a lightly padded envelope and OF COURSE the dragon earring was crushed - the area that grabs the outer ear.</li>
    <li> This is a very cute piece of jewelry but it broke the first time she wore it!  It took a long time for it to come in the mail and was broken beyond repair after the first wearing.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> Shipping takes a while, but the ear rings are really cool. You can&#x27;t beat the price. They are much better then I expected. I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another set for my friend. They turned out really good. Thanks</li>
    <li> the items did not work they where not mad right.i was not really happy.with them and will not get them again.</li>
    <li> These are going to look so cool!  My kids love dragons and all that stuff.  These will be great as small gifts!</li>
    <li> The don&#x27;t fit your ear. I&#x27;m not sure what shaped ear fits these earrings</li>
    <li> My review says it all, the snake shaped earring broke in three pieces when I tried to adjust the size, I was kind of disappointed because I really wanted that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other two (the non piercing dragon and the pierced style dragon) seem a little fragile too, luckily I didn&#x27;t have to adjust them to get them to fit my ear.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t really complain too much because the items were only .99, plus you do get the blue cable thingy that cats seem to like.</li>
    <li> Daughter absolutely loved these when they were delivered</li>
    <li> The pieces break really easily... sometimes before you open the package.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, looked great</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know the dragon one was a clip on and I can not figure out how to put it on but the other ones are great</li>
    <li> NiceEshop this beautiful earings cuff it&#x27;s perfect to buy for this ponk rock friends, that always looking for something different and exclisive</li>
    <li> I like these earings their very unique. The only complaint I have is the large dragon does not fit and all the earings are very fragile.</li>
    <li> it hasn&#x27;t got here yet and was a christmas gift for my daughter so therefore i had to go out and get her something else</li>
    <li> These are really cool. I have tiny ears so they&#x27;re a bit big. And I cannot figure out how to wear them but I really like them.</li>
    <li> When I received my package ALL 3 of my ear pieces were broken. They are a lot cheaper looking in person, and I fear that even if they weren&#x27;t broken, thy wouldn&#x27;t have stayed on anyways.</li>
    <li> They look like they do in the pics. They break easily but you get what you pay for. Wish they came with earrings for the opposite ear.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my teenager step daughter... Not really my style but she really liked them. For the price, pretty good.</li>
    <li> not made very well You get what you pay for 2 arrived broken</li>
    <li> this was a great set ! so far they all fit good and I&#x27;ve had them a while none broke XD</li>
    <li> this was a really cool product the backs were bent on some like some of the comments said but DO NOT bend it i  bent it and now the neck is broken thanks to the negtive comments on here they looked small and i tried to bend them to make it fit but i broke it the and back on the snake came off (not my fault) and the backs were easy to bend back</li>
    <li> Okay, Don&#x27;t trust these little metal demons. One left my ear dangerously infected, the other two broke. Just go for the full priced one. Alchemy-something.. They have a website, and they give you high quality dragon ear cuff WITHOUT infections/ cheap metal. 18 bucks won&#x27;t kill ya, judt DO NOT GET THESE! You won&#x27;t even be able to wear it before it breaks.. also extreemly uncomfortable and took forever to ship</li>
    <li> They break really easily when you mold them into place to fit your ear; also very cheap looking and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very bad about breaking. I had ordered this a while back and my snake piece broke the minute I got it out the box. The piercing piece broke off. The ear clip broke off for the dragon that cuffs on. The metal breaks EASILY! Would not suggest!</li>
    <li> Needs improvements on ear sizes.not that accurate</li>
    <li> Made of cheap metal. Had it on for less then a few hours and it turned my ear green not to mention the swelling of my ear lobe</li>
    <li> These fit horrible. And 2 were broken when they got here. The one that isn&#x27;t broke, the backing won&#x27;t hold at all. Very disapointing</li>
    <li> The snake and the smaller dragon are cool and good quality( but are hard to put on) , but the bigger dragon broke when I got it!!!!! I suppose you get what you pay for....</li>
    <li> I did get them in by the estimated delivery time but that was still weeks after I ordered them. They came just wrapped in plastic and in an envelope so the posts on them were bent completely to the side! They are small, maybe for a kids ear so they did not fit right. I tried to bend them but one of them broke. Very cheap material. The back of one of them did not fit properly and it kept falling off. I would say DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I wish I had not ordered them.</li>
    <li> cheap cheap. if you have some super glue handy great if not you will have to get some</li>
    <li> These are all amazing ear cuffs and I would definitely recommend. Cut kind of edgy but not overly goth. They&#x27;re very detailed and durable. Plus the price is great!</li>
    <li> I got this for one of my friends at school, because I ordered them before and she wanted a set just like the ones that she had scene me. I got it for Christmas, and she loved it!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
    <li> They were too big for my ears. The one that just &amp;#34;cuffs&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t stay on at all but i like the ones that actually go through the lobe.</li>
    <li> Very cute! They look exactly like the picture and arrived within the estimated delivery date!</li>
    <li> These arrived as described. I think they&#x27;re fun and adorable, but as I haven&#x27;t seen my daughter wear them, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re stylish or comfortable!!!</li>
    <li> Cute but were too big or very uncomfortable</li>
    <li> The back stud came bent for shipping. When we bent it back so she could put it in her ear it broke off. So heavy it kept falling off her ear. The dragon cuff was a joke. It didn&#x27;t cuff on anything. My daughter is keeping that parts because she still thinks they look cool and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s going to purpose them in some other way, but they are unwearable as earrings.</li>
    <li> So this could be just because of my ear but only one of them actually fit (kinda) and then another one broke.</li>
    <li> Bad quality don&#x27;t waste the money. They break, the material sucks. It&#x27;s a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for all ears- if you try to bend and fix it it WILL break.</li>
    <li> I REALLY REALLY love these i am the only one in school that wears these and people beg me to get them one. theyre really cute and dont bother. really great price and easy to wear. i already boughtlike six different ones!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Only one of the three came out bettee</li>
    <li> Broken beyond repair upon arrival. I get that it is not meant to be good quality jewel but come on! The detail looked ok but at each of the welded area their were cracks or it was completely broken off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boo to this product. I say boo.</li>
    <li> this product came to me bent and broken never have I ever been this disappointed don&#x27;t think you can bend them back to a reasonable shape because you&#x27;ll have a pile of s*** in your hands</li>
    <li> Really awkward they do t sit on my ear right so I gave them away. The nice thing is that there so cheap.</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to fit in my ear but it&#x27;s too small. The reason I give it 4 stars it&#x27;s because they are cute, they fit on my mom&#x27;s ear, and you get what you pay for, they are descent-looking and they arrived today October 17th (the arriving date was October 31st).</li>
    <li> not the greatest quality. they don&#x27;t stay on your ears too will but it&#x27;s the same exact ones that are solf for $20 each at renaissance faires.</li>
    <li> Need to order these again... my daughter borrows way to much</li>
    <li> Fits well and great gifts</li>
    <li> kinda funny shapes and sizes. all three fit different ear types</li>
    <li> When I open the packet one was broken 😤😔</li>
    <li> All three of these were broken when I opened the package. I didn&#x27;t spend much on them so I&#x27;m not too upset.</li>
    <li> The wingless dragon doesn&#x27;t want to stay on my ear no matter what I try, also my friends think the snake looks like a hearing aid(it does fit though)... Winged dragon is really nice.</li>
    <li> these are a lot heavier than i thought they&#x27;d be.  i expected something cheap for the price i paid.  but no, they are quite weighty.  they are really nice and very detailed.  love them.</li>
    <li> These are so eye catching and fun.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased the dragon without the wings prior to this purchase. That previous purchase fit just barely (like it&#x27;s kind of tight)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if these were from a different maker but these were large. All three are more likely to get knocked off of my ear to just dangle (as the earring hole would hole them).&lt;br /&gt;I think I may need to break and re-attach the earring hole to make it fit though I don&#x27;t know if that would be worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note that pieces sticking out (like the ear stick) has a high chance of getting flattened in the shipping process.</li>
    <li> looks a lil cheap and trying to figure out how to wear it</li>
    <li> I do not recommend these to people with weird ears. My ears are a tad bit weird but i thought it would work out since it would go around the ear but it was just not for me</li>
    <li> My niece liked it. I just don&#x27;t really get her taste. Oh well.</li>
    <li> They are so cute! I love them and can&#x27;t wait to show them off!</li>
    <li> Tail is missing from the snake and the big dragon one doesn&#x27;t hold up to my ear</li>
    <li> I did not like these at all, they look cheap. None of them fit my ear, and one of them broke while I was trying to put if on. VERY UNHAPPY!</li>
    <li> Very cheap. All but one fell apart within a week.</li>
    <li> The two ear cuffs for pierced ears are decently good, the backings (the tails) aren&#x27;t really sturdy enough for me. But I enjoy them well enough to use whenever I am out of the house. However, I don&#x27;t like the third ear cuff. The placing of the cartilage cuff is strange, it makes it difficult to put on. I gave it to my friend, and even she had a hard time.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for. will use for halloween costume only.</li>
    <li> These were great gifts! Very sturdy pieces.</li>
    <li> None of them fit correctly. I can&#x27;t figure out who has ears shaped the way that these are designed, and two of them broke immediately. Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> Although i haven&#x27;t worn them out, I have tried them all on. 1 didn&#x27;t even fit! BUUUUUT the price you would pay for each of these anywhere else is beyond what I paid for all three through this one purchase. So, even with one being junk, it was still a great deal!!! Love love love the snake!</li>
    <li> The snake is wonderful, I wear it all the time. The clip dragon is ok, but I have a hard time wearing it. The other dragon broke as soon as I put it on. but I think its worth the money just for one.</li>
    <li> One of the earrings arrived broken, but the other two were great, and the shipping was fast. The head was broken clear off the small dragon earring, but I was still happy with the service and shipping.</li>
    <li> I understand they were cheap but this was terrible,  one was broken , then a second one broke as I was placing on my ear. They are not even repairable,  I make jewelry as a hobby and can repair my own but these were junk metal in bubblewrap ! Do not waste your money</li>
    <li> A little bit cheap looking but still pretty cool. Bought these for gifts and I think they will go over nicely.</li>
    <li> All I can say about these is you get what you pay for.  These are adorable pieces of jewelry, but they&#x27;re also cheaply made and break very easily. I only have one piece that still functions and that&#x27;s the snake earring. Both of the dragons, which were my favorite, are both broken.</li>
    <li> Takes a getting used to but look pretty cool. Can&#x27;t beat the price for what you get. Fun accessory. Not the best quality but not awful.</li>
    <li> The lives came early and were in great condition. They&#x27;re a little small, but maybe I just have big ears. Who knows. I could easily see these priced at five+ dollars in a store setting. They aren&#x27;t sturdy enough to last forever, but they&#x27;re fun while they&#x27;re here.</li>
    <li> These do run on the small side though. The only one that fit me is the large dragon with out the stud.</li>
    <li> One of the earring&#x27;s pierce parts was broken when it arrived, but still sits on the ear so I&#x27;m happy with them. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> These came in pretty quickly and in great condition. They fit the ear nicely and look really cool. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> They look really cool in the pictures but are a bit heavy and don&#x27;t stay in position very well. thanks</li>
    <li> Cool idea but they won&#x27;t fit my ear at all, or my sister&#x27;s, or my niece&#x27;s. I wouldn&#x27;t  bother buying unless you have gotten cuffs to fit before.</li>
    <li> All three are very beautiful, but the snake doesn&#x27;t look like a snake and ALL of them were damaged or bent it the wrong way.</li>
    <li> Serpent is hard to adjust. Dragon with wings up is not cooperative to the ear. Piercing dragon is by far my fav.</li>
    <li> They came in a cheap thin envelope that didn&#x27;t protect them. They were all bent up, not bad enough to not be repairable luckily. I got them put back in shape and they look really cute on, although they were a bit awkward to put on. They don&#x27;t pinch me or anything. The snake is cuter than I thought he&#x27;d be. I also got some weird velcro type thing that was blue and had the shop name on it. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s for, but my cats liked chewing on it.</li>
    <li> cheap and can&#x27;t get it on my  ear</li>
    <li> These are very difficult to keep up on the ears...Only one of them can really stay up, and that&#x27;s with a lot of effort. These are cool, but they weren&#x27;t designed very practically.</li>
    <li> came in a timely manner, packaged nicely and the earrings were ok I guess I think I liked the idea of them more.... look pretty interesting/cool on your ear....just not my cup of tea I guess, I don&#x27;t ever wear them :( they all appeared to fit around my ears nicely, I have average sized ears-</li>
    <li> One arrived broke and a second broke the first time it was used.</li>
    <li> They are pretty good quality and the price is so good. They fit very awkwardly on my ear though. Not a big deal but you are talking a risk buying them.</li>
    <li> These look great! I had to bend them to shape so they would stay on my ear, but that wasn&#x27;t much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These won&#x27;t be the greatest pieces you&#x27;ll ever own, but they are a great way to fill out your jewelry collection.</li>
    <li> Neat for the price, but you get what you pay for. The details are sloppy, but what can you expect for 1 buck</li>
    <li> after receiving the earrings the tops broke off.</li>
    <li> One was broken when it arrived and NONE of them fit properly.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Apic of how they should be put on would be helpful. Also, all were bent and need to be boxed for shipment. Was able to bend back into place, but that weekens the metal. Really cool once you figure them out, but not all that comfortable.</li>
    <li> They were a little squished in places, especially the posts.  I think the problem would be solved if they shipped in boxes instead of padded envelopes.</li>
    <li> came to late for xmas, too small for ears.. this was not a good purchase at all..people did not like</li>
    <li> They were cracked and broken. Not to mention the ring part was bent into a line. The tails barely fit into the earring, and it didn&#x27;t specify whether it was for left or right ear. The only thing I found useful was the cable tie they gave for free.</li>
    <li> It said it&#x27;ll be here by March 31st. It&#x27;s April 10 today and it&#x27;s Still not here. I think I might have to stick with eBay</li>
    <li> One of the three was broken, the other two did not fit.  Wish the description had mentioned how to measure to ensure fit.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because i loved the price for 3 earcuffs. Service was great - they arrived even before the estimated shipping date, and everything was included and intact.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve successfully tried on the snake and the dragon earrings. The dragon earcuff (the one with no piercing, only the two cuffs) is a bit tricky; the placements of the cuffs seem to be odd, and I haven&#x27;t yet mastered how to get it to fit on my ear.&lt;br /&gt;The one issue I&#x27;ve found thus far is that the glue that is holding the tails of the snake and dragon onto the backs of the earring portion seems to be weak; both of them are coming unglued. I&#x27;m assuming this is something that can be easily fixed with superglue, which I&#x27;ll be trying. This is the most major shortcoming I&#x27;ve seen thus far.</li>
    <li> This was mostly as described. They had quick Shipping. Two were a little bent when shipped but I was able to bend them back ok.</li>
    <li> love them all, I havent yet figured out the snake yet, but the other two have been very promising! The dragon cuff (bottom one) is rlly good but be careful and try not to excessively bend the cuff, as it is rather fragile and cracks. The other one is fine other wise! A good price for three and all look great!</li>
    <li> The earrings were made for people with very small ears. I myself do have pretty small ears but they [the earrings] do not hold on very well.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these ear rings. Just be aware that these are not High quality so be careful with them. I suspect they are made of pot metal as my daughter broke her first one within 10 min. After soldering the pin back on she is once again pleased and she likes to wear them often.</li>
    <li> First off I bought these as a gamble. But I like the earrings, fit nice, and needs a bit of adjustment. I have read the comments on how they broke or what not. Just buy some lock tight or guerrilla glue and fixed them. Mine came in PERFECT shape. I will be wearing these earrings on special occasions. My husband thinks they are nice and I love the dragon with the bigger wings. But I say if you buy them you ARE taking a gamble. I just got lucky.</li>
    <li> they are complete junk the piercings have horrible backing (tails) one want even glued together, the other the glue filed the hole and then the ease cuff was made for either a giant or an elf. the lower hook is large center hook is medium and top hook is extremely tiny. not worth it.</li>
    <li> Super cheap and cute for the time I had them, but broke pretty quickly. If you don&#x27;t mind having to buy another, go ahead.</li>
    <li> I waited for a really long time for these cuff earrings. I knew it would be awhile because it said it would be, but it arrived a few days after the expected date. However this was not my biggest concern. I tried all three earnings on as soon as I got the package. The dragon cuff only attached to the top of my earlobe and wouldn&#x27;t stay on. I tried the serpent and it instantly fell off as soon as I let it go. The only thing keeping it staying on was the back of the earring attachment. I tried on the the Sea serpent and the back was bent. This is the only one that might stay on- if i am careful. But it will easily fall off. I have tiny ears so they might fit for people with bigger ears but I highly doubt it. The thing I would suggest to the seller is to make an additional attachment on each of the earnings so that they can stay in place and on your ear. The only reason  am not giving this 1 star is because they are every beautiful and cheap. I can complain to much.</li>
    <li> When I saw these all I could think about was Kelesi, Mother of Dragons from the Game of Thrones series, and I had to have them. They were less than $3 all together, they came in the allotted time, and I always get compliments on them. The first one (the snake/Naga) is the one I wear the most and get the most compliments on. I cant figure out how the dragon with the wing and the cuff is supposed to go on! Ive turned it upside down and all kinds of ways and I cant figure out, but the other two fit perfectly and definenetly are show stoppers. I recommend for all dragon, serpent, Naga lovers, Game of throne lovers, etc. ( I get a lot of compliments from my Khmer friends)</li>
    <li> They stay in place with only one piercing but no pinching. The level of artistry is remarkable for the price ! These have detail even on the back ! Great stocking stuffer for that edgy teen/young adult in your life...or treat for yourself !</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the ear cuffs they don&#x27;t stay on, will not buy anymore.  Don&#x27;t buy.  The clip breaks. Never never</li>
    <li> do not fit my ears at all. had a couple other people try them and they did not fit either...cheap and bendable...</li>
    <li> very original- I love them&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure to amaze some of my friends giving this as a present. My favourite is the snake</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 pair of these earrings thinking that is have a back up incase one pair broke, however when i received them they were in excellent condition and pretty sturdy. The arrived before the expected delivery date and they look great</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I don&#x27;t have my ears pierced due to me always being in sports and not being able to keep them in for at least 2 weeks. Anyways. I ordered these because one didn&#x27;t need a piercing and I am getting my ears pierced soon. But the one that doesn&#x27;t require a piercing broke after a day of wearing it and it was hard to keep on and it pinched and bruised my ear. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> The snake earring fits the best out of the bunch. The snake is the lightest and also has better curves to grip your ear. The winged dragon was very hard to get into place and the weight caused it to fall off easily. The smaller dragon was also harder to keep on. It did have the benefit of being an actual earring (unlike the large dragon), so it&#x27;s tail stayed in place. The snake is also an actual earring. I don&#x27;t know if I would really recommend these to a friend. I might recommend them to someone with multiple piercings in their ears because another earring would be useful in holding the dragons onto the ear. I have considered trying to use those little gummy glue dots to hold the dragons onto the top of the ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pieces have great detail and look very neat on their own.</li>
    <li> They look very nice, but sadly they&#x27;re too big .  I had to bend them a little and use a bobby pen to keep it up.</li>
    <li> The quality might not be the best but for 3 bucks I&#x27;m not complaining. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on these earrings because they&#x27;re so unique and fun to wear. I tried finding them in stores but had no luck. Try them out. Just remember quality is a hit or miss with buying cheap jewelry</li>
    <li> they are cute on-line and good idea but poorly designed they were broken, dis-colored before I open the package and they do not fit or hold as they should heavy and fall cute idea just poor quality wouldn&#x27;t buy them again</li>
    <li> They can be a bit flimsy, one of the dragon cuffs broke, but the product isnt expensive and I was messing with it, so I won&#x27;t complain. Just be aware you have to be very careful. I get a lot of compliments whenever I wear them!</li>
    <li> I got them relatively on time and they are of good, study metal quality. I like how they look a lot.</li>
    <li> these are vary nice, and well worth the money, they got here when they said they would i had no problems and no need to contact them.</li>
    <li> Snake is the only good one.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received these in the mail. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but they look just like they do in the photos.I had a little trouble adjusting the dragon but once I managed to put it on correctly it was fine. They don&#x27;t feel heavy and look great.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter Loves them,fast shipping</li>
    <li> A charming set of ear jewelry wraps. My daughter saw some in a different catalog and they were somewhat pricey. We found them on Amazon at a much better price. They had the same quality and looked excellent on. They came in time for Christmas too. We were very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> They fit my ear just fine, and i haven&#x27;t had a problem with breakage or falling off or anything, but they are definitely something to wear for a few hours, a days trip out and about. Not something you can sleep in or anything, not that I expected it to be. They get caught in my hair so I have to put it up or keep it off that side when I wear them, and I don&#x27;t wear them that often, but all in all, a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Are these cheap crap from China? Yes.  Did I have to pull out my pliers and bend all 3 in some way to make them actually fit my ear or have the stem going in the correct direction? Yes.  Would I recommend these to someone? Absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 earrings for $4.... I can wear all of them and love them (after some tweeking)</li>
    <li> Just what my daughters wanted.</li>
    <li> fits great and looks cool</li>
    <li> it you will allow me to be honest, I thought these were pretty cool but its hard to get the snake and dragon to stay on because the back piece does not stay...like they both have a tail as the part you put behind your ear to secure the earring but it doesn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t know if it was a flaw on mine or not but I&#x27;ll have to find another back to make the earring stay on.  now the ear cuff the winged dragon is nice but it hurts so you can&#x27;t wear it for long period of time.  they are nice and they look like the picture.  I would have given 5 stars but can&#x27;t keep the earing on my ear because the back piece doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I like the three pieces, but it&#x27;s really hard to put it on, I love it, but they are heavy. And one of them is broken :(</li>
    <li> These look amazing online but once I actually got them and tried them on they didn&#x27;t fit right and looked weird.</li>
    <li> The earrings came crammed into a tiny, ripped bag. All three earrings were bent and one was broken. Waste of money, wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> My ears are too big (or these ear cuffs are too small), so I am unable to wear them; this problem could have bee avoided if they were made to be adjustable for different ear sizes.  The quality is fine and they look neat and I really wish I could have worn them!  Darn!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have larger (or even medium-sized ears; basically if you don&#x27;t have small ears) you might want to avoid these types of ear cuffs as they may end up being unusable for you.</li>
    <li> fell apart as soon as I put it on.</li>
    <li> Not happy,  they broke the same day that I got them.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Broke just trying to put it in.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality. As soon as I took them out of the packaging one broke and the second one doesn&#x27;t fit anyone&#x27;s ear. So only 1 of the 3 is used. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again nor would I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Doesnt fit and broke right away. Not adjustable at all.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and on time, packaged well in great condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would clear coat the metal with nail polish before wearing so the metal doesn&#x27;t change colours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the product and I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I was not happy with these at all !! I guess you pay for what you get. They broke the next day</li>
    <li> They look so cool on my ears.</li>
    <li> One was broken when arrived, they seem like they are made for a child&#x27;s ear, so small, cheap and not flexible at all !!! Save your money !</li>
    <li> broke super easily. did not fit my ears at all for some reason. very cute but very cheaply made.... :/</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister and I think she likes it. I just  have never seen her wear any of them. If she has, I have failed to notice, but the most important thing to me is that she still has them and treasures them very much!</li>
    <li> Piece of crap. Do not waste your time or money, all of my earrings broke the day I got them.</li>
    <li> I love the over the ear earrings but once I tried putting these on they snapped! Very disappointed because I waited so long for these  just for disappointment. :/ Don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I just got them today, they came in a standard, bubble-wrap interior yellow envelope but they were a little bent. The snake is actually very cute and hangs on the best. The tails were troublesome to get on and the posts kept bending as I was attempting to get them on. The winged dragon won&#x27;t stay on however. Overall, they&#x27;re good for the price, but I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
    <li> I did not like these at all. They broke easily and my ear started itching as soon as I put them on.  I know they&#x27;re fake but it shouldn&#x27;t do that.  I also didn&#x27;t like that they were for different ears.  If I wanted left and right ear cuffs, I would have looked for that purposely.  I wanted them to all be left sided.  I also thought that these cuffs would at least have a part that goes through the cartilage piercing like the ear lobe, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I would only recommend this for tweens - teenagers.</li>
    <li> These came a week early and in great condition. None were broken. The dragon and the snake both fit my ear perfectly, though the dragon does not fit my friend&#x27;s ear. The back piece on the snake fits on both the snake and the serpent. It took me a while, but eventually I was able to fit the back piece of the serpent onto the proper ear cuff. The part of the serpent that fits through the ear pokes the side of my head, but if I pull my ear away slightly, I can fit the back on and it no longer pokes me. I would recommend this item and I will definitely use this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t fiit my ear</li>
    <li> Great price but earrings were to big for my ear and looked kinda dumb.</li>
    <li> The posts broke off after a couple uses and the cuff dragon with out a post hurt my ear. It&#x27;s too small</li>
    <li> I got these yesterday and they are much better than the description led me to believe, they easily adjusted to fit my ears and they don&#x27;t cause any pain or discomfort, they look awesome!</li>
    <li> they all broke but the snake, you cant adjust them at all, fun idea but not made to hold up unfortunately</li>
    <li> I bought the snake one before individually. I figured I&#x27;d get three this time. Problem is, they&#x27;re all different sizes, and only the snake fit my ear. I had to bend the part that inserts into my ear, and it broke the little tail. The backer of the earring detached from the tail and the other two won&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> Awful! They were all broken except one when they arrived!</li>
