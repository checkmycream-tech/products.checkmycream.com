      <li>The first time I tried it was when after I removed my makeup, and I saw a huge difference removes makeup even after you thought you have taken it all off.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it all the time because you don&#x27;t want to be too harsh on your face and age it prematurely, but once every other day/every 3 days or something would be good, just to make sure you get a good clean.</li>
      <li>rarely use the enclosed tube of exfoliating cleanser.</li>

      <li>my skin feels extra clean!</li>

      <li>Love that it&#x27;s pink too!</li>
      <li>First time I used it my face felt sooo soft.</li>
      <li>use the brush with the Dove soap, just a quick overall wash.  </li>
      <li>I think it is too early to really see how well it will do.</li>
      <li>Its soft and cleans very well.</li>
      <li>Has 2 settings the normal and</li>
      <li>Be aware that since it is taking away excess oils and dirt that your face well breakout for the first couple of days(s) or so, overall I have definitely seen a difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>and I have sensitive skin to begin with!  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my 11 year old daughter as she wanted a clairsonic.</li>
      <li>This product works well so far.</li>
      <li>Soft on the skin, removes the makeup from your skin even if you have remove it with the makeup wipes &amp; you can use it in the shower</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to get a gentle daily exfoliation.</li>

<li> I am not sure why I didn&#x27;t do it sooner.</li>
<li> It requires 2 AA batteries and it came with a spin head and small tube of cleanser.</li>
<li> These are bad for face.</li>

    <li> Smaller than I expected but it works fine.</li>
    <li> I like the cleaner itself, but the exfoliator that came with it was way too harsh for my skin and made it very red and burn. I&#x27;ve since been using with my own sensitive skin exfoliator and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter as she wanted a clairsonic. I previously purchased an Olay Pro X about two years ago and it worked very well. In this case I bought her the this one as it was a huge cost savings to me. She loves it and love the color pink. She uses it everyday and her skin is gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I have used this Olay Pro-X for 4 consecutive days and my skin feels a little bit smoother and has not become red or sensitive and I have sensitive skin to begin with!  I haven&#x27;t used it without their cleanser though.  I recommend this product to get a gentle daily exfoliation.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time! Works as advertised!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product! Every time I use it my skin feels extra clean! I took off one star because I felt like face wash that comes with it really didn&#x27;t clean my face well. But if you use a face cleanser you enjoy than this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Use this everyday... i love it.. makes my face feel so clean</li>
    <li> I got this on Amazon Prime Day and I have been using this daily in the shower. I like that it is easy to hold in my hand and that my wash clothes are no longer stained from makeup.  This brush really cleans my face well and my skin feels great. It is easy to rinse out so no makeup residue is on the bristles too. You can get replacement brushes if you need them but so far, I am good. I am glad I made this purchase. I am not sure why I didn&#x27;t do it sooner.</li>
    <li> The machine is good quality. .</li>
    <li> This brush works as intended. Cleans face and removes dead skin…It can also be used in the shower or tub. I can&#x27;t use it every day as my skin gets too dry..I recommend it..</li>
    <li> I purchased this on an Amazon Lightning Deal at a very good price.  I was actually looking for a cleansing brush that I could use on my face to remove sunscreen.  I usually wash my face with Dove for sensitive skin, and I often feel as if it does not remove all my sunscreen lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the brush with the Dove soap, just a quick overall wash.  It leaves my skin feeling very clean without too much abrasion.  I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely use the enclosed tube of exfoliating cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love it! The first time I tried it was when after I removed my makeup, and I saw a huge difference removes makeup even after you thought you have taken it all off. Be aware that since it is taking away excess oils and dirt that your face well breakout for the first couple of days(s) or so, overall I have definitely seen a difference in my skin. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love this! Got it yesterday on Amazon Prime Day and it came today. Came with the face wash, batteries, rotating head and the actual device. It feels so nice. Has 2 settings the normal and then a faster one. I have been battling mild acne for over a year and I got this in hopes to put it to rest. Only used it once so far but my skin feels so much cleaner than just using my hands! Will update once I have my results!</li>
    <li> Soft on the skin, removes the makeup from your skin even if you have remove it with the makeup wipes &amp; you can use it in the shower + it is affordable ;)</li>
    <li> I got a great deal on this on Prime Day, and I have to say, I love it!! I&#x27;m not sure why this is much smaller than I thought it would be, that&#x27;s not a problem though. First time I used it my face felt sooo soft. Makes my face feel super clean and my face cleanser foams up very nicely with it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it all the time because you don&#x27;t want to be too harsh on your face and age it prematurely, but once every other day/every 3 days or something would be good, just to make sure you get a good clean. There are two speeds, the slower speed isn&#x27;t quite as harsh.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I love it! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> cheap, good, and prompt delivery. Does the job.</li>
    <li> So powerful and my face feels clean! Great price!</li>
    <li> Great gift for up and coming young faces to inspire them to keep their faces clean. Its soft and cleans very well.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy the clarisonic mia which costs $150 at Sephora and the amazon website but lucky for me it showed other alternatives one of which is the Olay pro x! Only $23! Love that it&#x27;s pink too! It requires 2 AA batteries and it came with a spin head and small tube of cleanser. I purchased a exfoliate  cream which comes with a spin sponge and 2 pack of extra brush heads! Love how it has my face! Must buy!</li>
    <li> I ordered the limited edition pink advanced cleansing system. I love the color and it is very easy to use. I like that it is small so i can bring it when i travel.</li>
    <li> This product works well so far. I think it is too early to really see how well it will do. That&#x27;s the reason I am giving it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> These are bad for face. I thought this was supposed to be like a cheaper version of the Mia, but it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!!</li>
    <li> Just tried it today and I&#x27;m already seeing a difference! My face is soft and my acne is less visible in just one try! This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Works well, but does make my face a little sensitive.</li>
    <li> Two days using and my skin feels so much better and my acne is clearing up.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the cleanser it came with. I use coconut oil because I have oily skin.</li>
