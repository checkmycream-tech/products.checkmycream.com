      <li>I bought this over 3 years ago after trying a friend&#x27;s and absolutely loved it.</li>

      <li>The Croc Pro 450 is just the perfect flat iron.</li>
      <li>Excellent flat iron.  </li>

      <li>I am totally happy with the Croc flat iron.</li>
      <li>I have been an avid fan of the Chi for 5 years or more.  </li>
      <li>In addition, it seems a bit more \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; (for lack of a better word) to the action you&#x27;re performing -curling or straightening w/ ease</li>
      <li>This is by far the best iron I have used that is only around $100.</li>
      <li>so when when I tried it out on those parts and it goes strait right away!</li>
      <li>This is a good product, my daughter loves it, says she only has to go through hair once.  </li>
      <li>The shipping was so reasonable and it was the best one out there and was cheaper by 10$ on any other website!</li>
      <li>I finally have a tool that really works great for me.  </li>
      <li>Delivered quickly.  </li>
      <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
      <li>just was not getting my hair to be as \\&quot;flat\\&quot; as I wanted it or as quickly.    </li>
      <li>Heats up quick.  </li>
      <li>This thing works great on black hair.</li>
      <li>Buy it well worth the price.</li>
      <li>If you want the full warranty you would be better off paying the extra $30 from the Solia site.</li>
      <li>The straightener is very very fast to heat up.</li>
      <li>The price was higher on this one</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair straight and silky looking!  </li>
      <li>I just got this and tried it out for the first time</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I have been looking for.      </li>
      <li>So I took the chance because I love this flat iron.    </li>
      <li>Most flat irons don&#x27;t have problems after the break in period.</li>
      <li>It also has a digital temperature gauge which makes it easy to know just how hot the iron is and also makes it even easier to adjust</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!!!</li>
      <li>It has the long swivel cord which I just love.     </li>
      <li>It heats up so darned fast</li>
      <li>w/ too much heat.  </li>
      <li>, my hair doesn&#x27;t curl as much as it did before.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and does not take long to heat up.</li>
      <li>Even on days when it rains or there&#x27;s high humidity my hair stays straight.  </li>
      <li>The Croc gets hot fast, the digital screen lets you know how hot it is.  </li>
      <li>I love how it memorizes the previous temperature setting</li>
      <li>NOW, with the TurboIon Croc Pro 450 Titanium my style time and amount of product usage is cut in half with even better results.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>After reading all the reviews for flat irons,I chose this because of the quick heat time and ease of operation.  </li>
      <li>My hair is left super shiny and soft!</li>
      <li>This flat iron is worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Croc is the new Chi.</li>
      <li>Brand new.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this flat Iron over a ceramic iron for anyone who really wants to have straight hair.</li>
      <li>Uses it pretty much daily!</li>
      <li>It gets much hotter much quicker than my other one, it&#x27;s digital, and it really makes my hair soooooo much softer!</li>
      <li>I first used the Croc Flat Iron when I was on vacation with my friend and that was the moment I was hooked.  </li>
      <li>But my hair is naturally wavy</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot to make my hair straight.</li>
      <li>I  have naturally wavy/curly hair</li>
      <li>The product survived up until early this year</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally strait</li>
      <li>I have very curly natural hair, and this is the ONLY flat iron that makes my hair look like I have a relaxer in it; it gets that straight.</li>
      <li>I have used many hair irons from regular retail brands that ranged from awful to pretty good to the expensive ceramic brands since they are better for your hair.</li>
      <li>However, the price was right ($100 less than in store).</li>
      <li>I decided to keep it and use it, because Amazon has their own warranty on purchases and if anything was going to go wrong</li>
      <li>It also cools down much faster than some of the others I have used.    </li>
      <li>one showing Turboion croc and the other says classic croc..</li>
      <li>I spend less time on my hair because the flat iron works really well</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The Croc Pro 450 is just the perfect flat iron. I had used several before I bought the Croc. It leaves my hair silky straight and does a great job straightening all the gray hair too. I love how it memorizes the previous temperature setting so you don&#x27;t have to set the temperature every time. It heats up so darned fast I love it. It also cools down much faster than some of the others I have used.    It has the long swivel cord which I just love.     The only draw back is the fact that when I was filling out the warrantee card, it wanted the store name, address and phone number. I had to call the company because Amazon filled this order. They told me the seller on Amazon and Amazon themselves are not legal distributors and there for the warranty is void.     I decided to keep it and use it, because Amazon has their own warranty on purchases and if anything was going to go wrong it would during the Amazon warranty period on purchases through Amazon. So far so good. Most flat irons don&#x27;t have problems after the break in period. So I took the chance because I love this flat iron.    If you want the full warranty you would be better off paying the extra $30 from the Solia site. I would have done that if I would have known at the time of purchase that Amazon and their sellers are not authorized distributors.    I am totally happy with the Croc flat iron.</li>
    <li> The straightener is very very fast to heat up. It&#x27;s nice to be able to control the temp so precisely. I have been getting compliment after compliment on my hair after buying this straightener, all other things being the same. I even had a good straightener before this one, but it died on me.    Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best straightener I have ever used. But my hair is naturally wavy and I&#x27;m afraid with it being such a powerful straightener, my hair doesn&#x27;t curl as much as it did before.</li>
    <li> On this site there were 2 listings for the Croc..one showing Turboion croc and the other says classic croc..They are both the same..The price was higher on this one so i went with it..But later found out they are one in the same Iron. The other iron is like 8$ less than this one. Just fyi..so dont be fooled by the names they are the same product. Im upset that i didnt know that in advance. This product has 17 reviews vs the other at only two..but they are the same. Other than that i like it.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this on me and I wanted the same look she gave me at the salon...so I saved up and purchased one at a great price and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it. The shipping was so reasonable and it was the best one out there and was cheaper by 10$ on any other website! The day i got it and it cut my doing my hair time down by almost 30 min! I am pleased wiht the product. I am sending in the warrenty because it has said error on it several times now so fear that something might be wrong with it! So time will tell</li>
    <li> I first used the Croc Flat Iron when I was on vacation with my friend and that was the moment I was hooked.  I have wavy long hair and lots of it and the other flat iron I was using just was not getting my hair to be as \\&quot;flat\\&quot; as I wanted it or as quickly.    The Croc gets hot fast, the digital screen lets you know how hot it is.  The design makes it easy to get close to the roots.   I get compliments all the time on how I look like I came from the salon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the inexpensive straighteners you can usually buy from Target or Walmart, but I wanted to try something new to try to get my hair softer and smoother. I talked to my hair stylist about it, and she recommended the TurboIon Croc. I was skeptical about the \\&quot;new technology\\&quot; that she mentioned in promoting her product (they all call themselves ceramic/ion technology it seems).  However, I decided to try it.  I was so impressed with the straightener! It gets much hotter much quicker than my other one, it&#x27;s digital, and it really makes my hair soooooo much softer! I was recommend the product!</li>
    <li> I have been an avid fan of the Chi for 5 years or more.  My hair is a mix of African American and Native American and is very curly and THICK.  It takes a ton of product and repetitive strokes with the Chi flat iron to get my hair into a sleek style.  NOW, with the TurboIon Croc Pro 450 Titanium my style time and amount of product usage is cut in half with even better results.  I have had so many friends, including my own hair dresser, comment on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.  I finally have a tool that really works great for me.  It is exactly what I have been looking for.      1. Heats up quickly.  2. You can set temp to your hairs needs.... all the way to 450! ( I need the 450 temp,        but I use heat protection products on my hair too.)  3. Glides through hair easily.  4. Great for curling, as well as straightening.  I have had great results with both styles.  5. Delivered quickly.  6. Great price.</li>
    <li> Delivered in a timely fashion, functions as advertised, very pleased with the seller and the product.    Thanks.</li>
    <li> This thing works great on black hair. My hair doesnt even get curly anymore after I wash it or at the gym. Buy it well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Brand new.  Excellent flat iron.  Heats up quick.  My daughter loves it!  Uses it pretty much daily!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews for flat irons,I chose this because of the quick heat time and ease of operation.  I guess I haven&#x27;t got the knack yet of using an iron because I always end up with a \\&quot;kink\\&quot; about a half-inch from the end of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used many hair irons from regular retail brands that ranged from awful to pretty good to the expensive ceramic brands since they are better for your hair. This is by far the best iron I have used that is only around $100. How great!! I have used one that was over $200 and I felt wasn&#x27;t as good as this one. My hair is left super shiny and soft!</li>
    <li> This product is great and worth the price.  I  have naturally wavy/curly hair and I only have to pull this iron through one time and that&#x27;s it!  It leaves my hair straight and silky looking!  Recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> Bought this Croc for my daughter. She had been using her mothers Chi. She likes it better than the Chi. Croc is the new Chi.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other ceramic flat irons that don&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one.  This one is titanium and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair as ceramics tend to do.  It also has a digital temperature gauge which makes it easy to know just how hot the iron is and also makes it even easier to adjust so you don&#x27;t dammage your hair w/ too much heat.  In addition, it seems a bit more \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; (for lack of a better word) to the action you&#x27;re performing -curling or straightening w/ ease -tho I do have STRIGHT hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is worth every penny.  I have very curly natural hair, and this is the ONLY flat iron that makes my hair look like I have a relaxer in it; it gets that straight.</li>
    <li> I have tried many flat irons, this one works the best. I shopped around and this was the best price for the Titanium Croc. I recommend this flat Iron over a ceramic iron for anyone who really wants to have straight hair. It&#x27;s easy to use and does not take long to heat up. I spend less time on my hair because the flat iron works really well and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot to make my hair straight. Even on days when it rains or there&#x27;s high humidity my hair stays straight.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, my daughter loves it, says she only has to go through hair once.  Happy that I bought it for her.</li>
    <li> I just got this and tried it out for the first time and I LOVE IT!!! My hair is naturally strait but at some parts it does this little flipy curl thing, so when when I tried it out on those parts and it goes strait right away! I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this over 3 years ago after trying a friend&#x27;s and absolutely loved it. It arrived earlier than expected and the box condition was pristine. The only drawback which I knew when I purchased it was the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty would not be upheld because it was not bought from a licensed distributor. However, the price was right ($100 less than in store). The product survived up until early this year so sadly I had to throw it away but I did buy a replacement from Amazon. If I ever need to recommend a straightener this is the one I always do, way better than the more well known Chi.</li>
