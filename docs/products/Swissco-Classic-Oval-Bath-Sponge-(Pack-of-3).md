### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and she is very happy.</li>
      <li>item was excellent.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Great sponge.</li>
      <li>Great shape and firmness.</li>
      <li>Very nice.  </li>
      <li>What used to be a wonderful, soft sponge that made a great lather now feels like I&#x27;m using sandpaper on my skin!  </li>
      <li>Good size to hold in your hand.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find them online, and they are just as good as I remember.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such a great product and great service.</li>
      <li>They fit nicely in the hand.  </li>
      <li>This was an OK sponge</li>
      <li>I tore the sponge clean in two!  </li>
      <li>They are a great size, lather well, and have a great surface for cleansing as well as exfoliating the body - soft but not too soft to exfoliate.</li>
      <li>So, word to the wise, treat them gently - they&#x27;re delicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Swissco Classic Oval Bath Sponges for many years and was very satisfied with the product -- until now.  </li>
      <li>Good product, high price.</li>
      <li>Too small, crumbled apart after a couple weeks use, not made the greatest.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this bath sponge.</li>
      <li>will more than likely purchase more if they still have them here.</li>
      <li>The next three I bought a year or two ago didn&#x27;t seem as good as I remember the first being, but still held up well.</li>
      <li>For some reason they all stopped carrying it and started carrying more natural looking sponges.  </li>
      <li>So I was thrilled, actually, to find these at Amazon.</li>
      <li>I know I will order more when these get old and need replacing.</li>
      <li>The first three I bought around 4-5 years ago were great... soft, and lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>Pretty as they are they just aren&#x27;t my cup of tea.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think they are worth the price, but I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere else.</li>
      <li>They are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy using this as it is soft and holds a lot of water and soap for my shower.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>this is exactly what i was looking for in all sorts of stores.  </li>
      <li>I have looked in many stores, for these sponges, but Amazon, is the only place that had them.</li>
      <li>This, on the other hand, is hands down the best shower sponge I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>Shipped in fresh package and brand new as stated!</li>
      <li>Soft on the skin and dries out fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>My wife says these are better than she expected.</li>
      <li>And I really dislike those nylon puff balls.</li>
      <li>This sponge lasts for months and is much softer.  </li>
      <li>&quot; that&#x27;s very slippery, and out of shape, and does not scrub the body well.  </li>
      <li>For anyone who prefers a real bath sponge, these are the ones.</li>
      <li>I even tried other types and most were too scratchy.</li>
      <li>Such a waste of money on what used to be a good product.</li>
      <li>seriously, I do not understand why you can&#x27;t find these anymore.</li>
      <li>These are interesting sponges - they exfoliate by having a little bit of grit to them, something you wouldn&#x27;t expect from a sponge.  </li>
      <li>Because of this, they also tend to fall apart a bit faster than normal...</li>
      <li>its the same as the sponge u get at target, i own both, and i feel i wasted</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft as well.</li>
      <li>The first sponge disintegrated into a million pieces after only 3 showers.  </li>
      <li>It holds soap far better than my last one, so I go through less bar soap as a result.</li>
      <li>I prefer them over the more common mesh ones found today.</li>
      <li>Stays soft after drying.  </li>
      <li>The one I used this morning, plus the other 2 are going right in the trash.  </li>
      <li>I used the new sponge several time already.  </li>
      <li>For the price, they are very flimsy and won&#x27;t last long before they start tearing.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve noticed that they leave some of their grit residue behind and you need to wash off a bit more vigorously.  </li>

<li> I ordered a set of these to try out as my other sponge was getting old.  </li>
<li> the pack of three should last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Recently, it was again time to order a new 3-pack, and I did so despite seeing some recent negative reviews.</li>
<li> I rarely write reviews but when a product is this poor</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how long they last as I have only had them a little while, but there are 3 to a package.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t even open the other two, and have requested to return them for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> THE SIZE OF THE SPONGE IS A LITTLE LARGER</li>
<li> comes three tiny little sponges where as it will take two to compare with the size that is advertised.  </li>
<li> I have purchased the product before and it performs as expected.</li>
<li> This item is getting harder to find even on the internet.  </li>
<li> That being said, they&#x27;re a little delicate - I attempted to wring one would (Like I would normally wring out a sponge) and felt like the Hulk.  </li>
<li> Have to think of using the sponge around house for other cleaning purposes.</li>
<li> I have used this product in the past, but could not find in my local market anymore.</li>
<li> The sponges were very rough but never advertised as exfoliating.</li>
<li> They were less porous than expected, but they work as well as others I have had.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t typically leave reviews, but years ago did not hesitate to leave a five-star rating.</li>
<li> too dense , too thick , not soft and leave some residue ,will not buy again</li>
<li> Unfortunately, those negative reviews ended up being correct: the sponge felt like sandpaper, which I initially hoped would go away after being broken in, but instead, it began to tear and then after only four uses, was completely falling apart and disintegrating (see attached photo).</li>
<li> I have used these sponges in the past, and then couldn&#x27;t find them in stores anymore.</li>
<li> The problem of the sponge is just too thick.  </li>
<li> not good at all.</li>
<li> Tough and durable comes in a package of three.</li>
<li> Quality was poor.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had to change it to 1 star, and encourage anybody to stay away from these.</li>
<li> I have used this product before; and, have been unable to find them until I came to this website.</li>
<li> I was disappointed.  </li>
<li> Very disappointing quality.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but when a product is this poor I don&#x27;t want others to make the same mistake. I&#x27;ve used the Swissco Classic Oval Bath Sponges for many years and was very satisfied with the product -- until now.  What used to be a wonderful, soft sponge that made a great lather now feels like I&#x27;m using sandpaper on my skin!  Perhaps the manufacturer sought to improve the item, but instead succeeded in ruining it.  Ugh.  These came 3 to a package. The one I used this morning, plus the other 2 are going right in the trash.  Such a waste of money on what used to be a good product.</li>
    <li> Delivery time exceeded expectations.  I have purchased the product before and it performs as expected.</li>
    <li> I have used these sponges in the past, and then couldn&#x27;t find them in stores anymore. I was thrilled to find them online, and they are just as good as I remember. For anyone who prefers a real bath sponge, these are the ones. With a pack of three, I know they will last me for years.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this bath sponge. I&#x27;d been buying them in the stores and all of a sudden couldn&#x27;t find them anymore. They are a great size, lather well, and have a great surface for cleansing as well as exfoliating the body - soft but not too soft to exfoliate.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for sponges like this in stores and could not find one anywhere.  This sponge holds together, where others fall apart after using a couple of times.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This was an OK sponge but it didn&#x27;t stand up well to repeated use.  After a month or so of showers, it started to split apart.</li>
    <li> this is exactly what i was looking for in all sorts of stores.  seriously, I do not understand why you can&#x27;t find these anymore.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  For the price, they are very flimsy and won&#x27;t last long before they start tearing.  Won&#x27;t order these again.</li>
    <li> I have looked in many stores, for these sponges, but Amazon, is the only place that had them. I ordered several.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TK</li>
    <li> My wife says these are better than she expected. I agree with her opinion. I hope that this source doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
    <li> Tough and durable comes in a package of three. Soft on the skin and dries out fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> This item is getting harder to find even on the internet.  I prefer them over the more common mesh ones found today.</li>
    <li> Used to buy sponges like this at local stores.  For some reason they all stopped carrying it and started carrying more natural looking sponges.  They are all courser and fall apart after a couple of weeks of use.  This sponge lasts for months and is much softer.  Great sponge.</li>
    <li> Like several had said, I can&#x27;t find sponges like this in stores anywhere... only the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sponges or plastic loofas. Anything close is garbage; the last one I found at a grocery store fell apart within months. This, on the other hand, is hands down the best shower sponge I&#x27;ve ever had. It holds soap far better than my last one, so I go through less bar soap as a result. It&#x27;s very soft as well. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months, and it has held up very well... the pack of three should last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2016 UPDATE: The first three I bought around 4-5 years ago were great... soft, and lasted a long time. The next three I bought a year or two ago didn&#x27;t seem as good as I remember the first being, but still held up well. Recently, it was again time to order a new 3-pack, and I did so despite seeing some recent negative reviews. Unfortunately, those negative reviews ended up being correct: the sponge felt like sandpaper, which I initially hoped would go away after being broken in, but instead, it began to tear and then after only four uses, was completely falling apart and disintegrating (see attached photo).

Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had to change it to 1 star, and encourage anybody to stay away from these.</li>
    <li> I used the new sponge several time already.  The problem of the sponge is just too thick.  It soaks up soap and becomes a \\&quot;soap ball\\&quot; that&#x27;s very slippery, and out of shape, and does not scrub the body well.  I stopped using it after 2 days.  Have to think of using the sponge around house for other cleaning purposes.</li>
    <li> too dense , too thick , not soft and leave some residue ,will not buy again</li>
    <li> THE SIZE OF THE SPONGE IS A LITTLE LARGER THAN I LIKE, BUT IT HOLDS A LOT OF SUDS. I WILL BUY THESE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. I ONLY USE WASH RAGS FOR SHAVING.</li>
    <li> its the same as the sponge u get at target, i own both, and i feel i wasted s/h charges to get this. i DONT recommend it.</li>
    <li> The sponges were very rough but never advertised as exfoliating. The first sponge disintegrated into a million pieces after only 3 showers.  The second sponge did the same.  I did not bother to open the third sponge.  Very disappointing quality.</li>
    <li> will reorder to have spares</li>
    <li> The sponge started to tear on the 2nd day of use.  Quality was poor.</li>
    <li> The sponges work well.  They fit nicely in the hand.  I would recommend them.  My husband likes to use a sponge to bathe.</li>
    <li> the sponge that is shown  is advertised as a much bigger sponge,than you order and here comes three tiny little sponges where as it will take two to compare with the size that is advertised.  not good at all.</li>
    <li> They were less porous than expected, but they work as well as others I have had. Great shape and firmness.</li>
    <li> Good product, high price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before; and, have been unable to find them until I came to this website. &lt;br /&gt;I will more than likely purchase more if they still have them here. &lt;br /&gt;The speed in which I received said item was excellent. &lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such a great product and great service.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.I have used this product in the past, but could not find in my local market anymore. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Just what I have been trying to find in stores! I really don&#x27;t think they are worth the price, but I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere else.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted these. Couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere. Bought them here and she is very happy. Shipped in fresh package and brand new as stated! Recommend to anyone looking for something like this!</li>
    <li> After looking in every store I could think of for these sponges, I thought I would have to give up. I even tried other types and most were too scratchy. And I really dislike those nylon puff balls. Pretty as they are they just aren&#x27;t my cup of tea. So I was thrilled, actually, to find these at Amazon. They are exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These are interesting sponges - they exfoliate by having a little bit of grit to them, something you wouldn&#x27;t expect from a sponge.

Because of this, they also tend to fall apart a bit faster than normal...</li>
    <li> Too small, crumbled apart after a couple weeks use, not made the greatest.</li>

    <li> Very nice.  Exactly as described.  Stays soft after drying.  Good size to hold in your hand.  I would purchase again.</li>
