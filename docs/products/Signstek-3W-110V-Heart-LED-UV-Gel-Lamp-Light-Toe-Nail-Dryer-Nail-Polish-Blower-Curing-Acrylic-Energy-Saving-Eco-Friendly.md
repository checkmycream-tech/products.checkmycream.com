      <li>Cute!</li>
      <li>I bought this to start doing my own gels at home.</li>
      <li>Works great and for so much cheaper!  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Works great, very cute, but it probably only goes in about 3 or 4 inches</li>
      <li>Just make sure to cure the gel after the UV light with alcohol on cotton balls,</li>
      <li>Super cute.</li>
      <li>Thing is a light.</li>
      <li>I can fit all 5 of my fingers in.</li>
      <li>I could fit either all my fingers or all my toes inside.</li>
      <li>I think one LED light with a fan would be faster with the drying time.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>The space is limited inside, but all you need is the nails to be cured not your whole had lol.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to return it because didn&#x27;t actually use it for many, many months later.</li>
      <li>Great little product for the price!  </li>
      <li>Works well, really dries the gel polish quickly.</li>
      <li>You have to leave your hands under the light longer than more powerful lights, but those are more expensive too.</li>
      <li>I just used this cute little light to finish my gel manicure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as fast as a nail salon,  but for an at home nail dryer, that also works with your toes,  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight &amp; looks just how it does in the pic.</li>
      <li>love it, it small but works great, does takes a little longer but not much</li>
      <li>works ok but takes a long time to dry</li>

    <li> I had hope in this product but unfortunately, it was a lackluster purchase.  It takes so very long to dry. It&#x27;s definitely not worth the buy. Pay a little bit extra to get a quality product.</li>
    <li> Feel like I wasted money on this. Takes forever to dry nails.</li>
    <li> It was excellent..Loved it</li>
    <li> I just used this cute little light to finish my gel manicure. Very nice! I could fit either all my fingers or all my toes inside.</li>
    <li> Works well, really dries the gel polish quickly.</li>
    <li> Junk. Listed as blower and does acrylic nails and such. Thing is a light. That&#x27;s it. No blower. And box says for led gel nail polish. I&#x27;m returning.</li>
    <li> not sure about this one, haven&#x27;t seen it usage to date. I&#x27;m her spouse...</li>
    <li> It does a perfect job just in 30 secs, way better than a uv light</li>
    <li> I bought this to start doing my own gels at home. Works great, very cute, but it probably only goes in about 3 or 4 inches so I have to do my thumbs separately which is kind of annoying.</li>
    <li> Came in today. It&#x27;s very lightweight &amp; looks just how it does in the pic. Cute! Only bad thing is you can only cure 4 fingers at a time.</li>
    <li> So cute and portable, can&#x27;t wait to use!</li>
    <li> love it, it small but works great, does takes a little longer but not much</li>
    <li> Works great, so cute a great find!</li>
    <li> I bought these like a month and it&#x27;s worked just 2 time and died not good. It&#x27;s not working anymore. My boyfriend opened and it was the cables they were destroyed maybe by pulling by accident but I never pulled to hard haaaa! I noticed another thing and it was the cables were to thin and they were not to assembled correctly and that was the reasons. To bad!!!!!!....</li>
    <li> This seemed to help in drying  our  nails.  It&#x27;s not as fast as a nail salon,  but for an at home nail dryer, that also works with your toes,  it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> I think one LED light with a fan would be faster with the drying time. Otherwise It&#x27;s great for fingers or toenails</li>
    <li> You have to leave your hands under the light longer than more powerful lights, but those are more expensive too. I am happy with what I have since I don&#x27;t like spending a lot of money.</li>
    <li> works ok but takes a long time to dry</li>
    <li> Great little product for the price!  Saves paying &amp;40 at the nail salon!  Mine look just as good !!</li>
    <li> Was about what I expected, doesn&#x27;t have a timer tho</li>
    <li> This product works great.  Love it.  Lots and lots of lights so it should last forever.  Would order again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Has never worked.Wasn&#x27;t able to return it because didn&#x27;t actually use it for many, many months later.</li>
    <li> This is all you need to do your expensive gel nail curing!  The space is limited inside, but all you need is the nails to be cured not your whole had lol.  Works great and for so much cheaper!  Just make sure to cure the gel after the UV light with alcohol on cotton balls,</li>
    <li> Love this led lamp! Super cute. I can fit all 5 of my fingers in.</li>
    <li> My only question about this product was whether or not it was a UV lamp.  It says LED.  So I assumed it&#x27;s an LED lamp.  Because both &amp;#34;UV&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;LED&amp;#34; were in the title - I was confused.  But looking at the bulbs; they&#x27;re definitely LED.  I use for Gellish nail products and it works perfect.  I&#x27;ve had it for about two months now.</li>
