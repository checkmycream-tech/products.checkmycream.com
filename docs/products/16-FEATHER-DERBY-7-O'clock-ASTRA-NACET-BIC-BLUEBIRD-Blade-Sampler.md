<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ended up liking the Feather and 7 o&#x27;clock best. I shave twice a week and 7 o&#x27;clock was my choice.  The feather was great, but left me with a little burn after, but the cut was awesome.</li>
    <li> I thought these would be larger since I am a novice, but the entire pack comes in a small plastic bag that is not larger than .75 inches.  It will take me the better part of two years to use all of these blades.  I only shave 10 days a month and wouldnt shave at all if I had the choice, but these are great!  They are far better than the disposable plastic razors or razor heads.</li>
    <li> Paying a high premium to get an assortment, but I recommend it if you&#x27;re recently switching to DE shaving. Not everyone likes the same blade and the same blade doesn&#x27;t feel the same way in every razor. Wide assortment of excellent blades with varying degrees of sharpness.</li>
    <li> I did like this variety  pack because the majority of them worked well for me. I have not been wet shaving for too long so I was able to practice my technique with a wide variety of blades.</li>
    <li> I paid $12 for the pack which is outrageously over priced. I wish I had shopped around first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other places to buy random samples of blades for around 15 cents each. Google the phrase &amp;#34;try a blade&amp;#34; for an alternative that is priced fairly.</li>
    <li> The package arrived a couple days early which was great! I havent tried them all but so far the Derby leaves me with an amazes clean and smooth shave with no knicks. But I will continue to see if there is any others that I will like.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat new to using razor blades for shaving. I purchased the Merkur safety razor. This set comes with a good variety of blades and is a nice way of trying a lot of the different brands.</li>
    <li> Good variety for newbies. I&#x27;m a little disappointed that a good portion of the blades have a sticky residue from the packaging that is very difficult to remove. Hairs get stuck to it and make cleanup a little annoying at times. But all in all, it&#x27;s well worth the money to see which blade works best for you.</li>
    <li> A inexpensive way to wet shaving and to experiment with different manufactures of DE blades, that will actually work well with your own facial skin type, beard and enhance your total shaving experience. Being new to wet shaving and DE blades... I felt that trying out several of these different DE blades before I made my own personal blade selection only made sense... and after about a week or so of shaving using this sample pak... I found a blade that worked perfectly for me... every time I used it... and it wasn&#x27;t the most expensive brand either... which was a big plus to me and my wallet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you cannot go wrong purchasing this sample pak... try all the blades or just a few... you&#x27;ll know which blade will work for you, simply by feel and results... read all the reviews of the different DE blades in the pak... and check them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sample pak really saved me money... time... and found the blade that works for me... mileage may vary...</li>
    <li> Wish I would of just bought a variety pack of blades. These blades were all aged pretty badly (still in package) the only blade that worked well and some what glided through hairs would be the &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Excellent selection to try out several brands and figure out what works best for you.</li>
    <li> Very useful to get an idea of how different products feel. Just make sure to right down your thoughts somewhere so you can compare once you go through them all</li>
    <li> Nice selection for someone new to de razor shaving. Silver Blue and Feather both very good.</li>
    <li> every other week its a new blade. no need to stick to just one brand. those 5 blade razors can suck a bag of d***s</li>
    <li> They are razors and you use them on your face.</li>
    <li> This is a good way to test which blades are good for your face. Kind of expensive though. I just ended up buying a larger pack of Astra&#x27;s and Derby&#x27;s. Decided I liked both, but the Derby&#x27;s I liked a bit more (because they were easier on the face).</li>
    <li> The pack did what it needed to do, but wish I did more research on the blades included first. Seems like these re less popular blades in the shave community and have to go in blind with little reviews on what&#x27;s included. Next pack will include some of the more known brands</li>
    <li> Good sampling of blades.  When you first start using a safety razor you really need to try a bunch of different blades because they all shave differently depending on your style and your beard.</li>
    <li> excellent product, great service.</li>
    <li> Some of the blades are amazing and some were used only once or twice before I tossed them.  Overall, it was a good buy just to get an idea of how different blades feel.  I personally think the Feather and Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock are my favorites out of the bunch, but since sin and hair thickness can vary, I encourage everyone to try a blade sampler to figure out what suits their needs the best.</li>
    <li> Being new to DE safety shaving, I had no idea where to start looking for blades. This is perfect! A great assortment of blades from quite a few countries and manufacturers. Blades all came in their own paper sleeves and all bundled in a little ziplock baggie. Got every blade in the picture.    As is to be expected, some blades are better than others. I&#x27;ve used about 5 of the 16 and have already started noticing subtle differences in the blades. I will say however that I&#x27;ve not used a blade from this pack that was noticbly amazing or horrible.....yet. They all seem to be of average to good quality blades.    Edit 1/6/15: so far I&#x27;ve tried 6 of the blades, using each blade three times. Ill give each blade an avg review from 1-5.    Gillette 7&#x27;oclock- 2.5  Gillette Silver Blue- 3  Treet Platinum- 3  Astra Stainless- 3.5  Astra Platinum- 4  Super-Max Stainless- 2 (this is by far the worst blade I&#x27;ve ever used, tossed it after 1 shave)    Update 2/9/15   Super-Max platinum-2.5 (only slightly less crap than the stainless one)  Nacet stainless- 3.5  Nacet Platinum- 5 (the best blade I&#x27;ve ever used and its sadly discontinued)   Gillette Goal!- 4 (another great blade that you can&#x27;t get anymore. The platinum is avail the stainless, this one, isn&#x27;t)   Bluebird- 2.5 (Not impressed, cut me twice on the first shave)</li>
    <li> This is a must buy for anyone who is first getting into DE razor shaving as everybody has a different face so everyone&#x27;s face has different needs. Used all the blades in this and ended up liking the Gilette Nacet blade the most, so I ordered a 50 pack of them</li>
    <li> Two very good points about this product: 1) You get a very healthy sample of different blades to try so you can decide which one you like the best and then order it.  2) You probably won&#x27;t need to place another blade order for two-to-four months, depending upon your beard&#x27;s thickness and how fast it grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I often don&#x27;t shave over the weekend and I can get away with shaving on alternate days because my beard is silver (not much contrast against my face); it&#x27;s not super thick; and I shave according to the wet shave tutorials I&#x27;ve watched, which means my face feels smoother than a baby&#x27;s butt and smells infinitely better when I&#x27;m done.  Of course, you might not like any of the blades in the sampler, in which case you can try another blade manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No product is perfect, this sampler pack included.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that you get more than one of the blades I didn&#x27;t think were so great, like Nacet and Treet, and only one Feather and Derby, which many think are the superior blades (with Feather having a slight edge in sharpness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the Feather yet because I want to save it for last so I&#x27;ll better remember the shave.  If I like the shave it gives me and it doesn&#x27;t peel my face like a potato peeler (a common refrain I&#x27;ve read in comments about this blade, but I think mostly from wet shaving newbies), my next batch of blades will probably be an order of Feathers.  I&#x27;ll review them when, and if, I order them and, of course, use them.</li>
    <li> This was a good way for me to figure out which blades would work well with my beard.  Honestly, they are all good blades hard to tell the difference. It is a good bet though before committing to a huge multi pack that could last years. I would hate to be stuck with two years worth of razors I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Wish they would put a more even balance of blades in here like two of each. Other then that I would by again, if I were to be searching for best blades for my facial hair and razor.</li>
    <li> Good way to test out many different blades. I recently bought a safety razor and bought this assortment to try a variety of different blades. Everyone&#x27;s face is different but for me the Derby Extra blade and the Astra Superior Platinum seemed to give the closest, nick free shave. I&#x27;m still on the fence about DE shaving, sure it&#x27;s cheaper but it takes longer and requires more attention. Most of the time I just shave while in the shower. My skin is warm and soft and I just grab my Dorco, Pace 3 blade safety razor and I have a very good, fast shave in 2 minutes or less.</li>
    <li> Just got it so haven&#x27;t used them, but as described and all there</li>
    <li> This little kit is great for someone just getting into shaving with a safety razor. Personally I shaved twice with each and wrote down which were the top three that i liked and i ended up choosing the derby&#x27;s. All razors are not created equally and it makes a big difference to find the one that best suits your skin type.</li>
    <li> Nice way to try different blades.</li>
    <li> Great mix. Just starting out so this gave me a nice variety to figure out what I like.</li>
    <li> My recommendation - Do not buy this sampler pack because you really should get 2-3 of each type of blade. Just because one blade of one brand works, doesn&#x27;t mean that if you buy 100 that they will all feel like that. There is slight variation in blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was my fault for ordering this pack, but I would highly recommend that you buy a sampler with 2 or more blades from each company</li>
    <li> Great to know that not all blades are the same. I found my perfect blade in this variety pack.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t underestimate the difference in a blade. I have only gone through about 4 different blades so far but I have noticed some differences in each blade. Some I hated, and 1 so far, I have loved. I recommend this to anyone looking at getting into shaving with a straight razor.</li>
    <li> An assortment of second tier blades with a handful of high quality blades to really pick from if you are looking for which blade will give your face the best shave. I</li>
    <li> If you are tired of using the throw away plastic razors and are considering this type of razor system. This variety of blades is a good way to go. I too thought that a blade is a blade is a blade. There is a difference in the quality of the different brands. Some shave better, some last longer..some do both. I actually have less nicks and razor burn with this system than with the disposable plastic razors.</li>
    <li> good sample that allows flexibility for new users.</li>
    <li> Good sampler, but most of the blades weren&#x27;t very good. I guess that&#x27;s the point of a sample pack though, you find out which ones you like and which ones you don&#x27;t .</li>
    <li> This is an awesome sampler pack of razors, but you have to find out with blades are the best for you.</li>
    <li> I took some time to use a half dozen of these blades before posting my review. This was well worth the cost. Their are definite differences in each blade. This variety gives you a chance to see which one fits your needs.</li>
    <li> a good way to test a bunch of razors before you settle on one</li>
    <li> Arived sooner than expected. was exactly what i wanted. nice variety neatly packaged</li>
    <li> Great sampler, helped me come to the conclusion that the Feather blades are my go to blade now!</li>
    <li> Most razors aren&#x27;t worth it but great way to find a few good ones</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been working on finding the perfect blade for me, and this sampler has been a godsend. It has almost all of the blades I&#x27;ve read about and a few I haven&#x27;t heard of. If you&#x27;re looking to find your perfect shave, give this sampler a shot. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Good variety. I&#x27;m currently on my third blade and I can tell the difference between brands and how I&#x27;m starting to prefer one over the other. Exactly the reason to get this pack- to try out multiple brands.</li>
    <li> Wonderful selection of sample blades. I recently started wet shaving only 2 months ago and I can easily tell the difference between the majority of the blades in the sample pack. I think that the Derby blades are my favorite right now.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice sampler, I&#x27;d just wished I&#x27;d gotten the larger pack with multiples of each blade, just so I could be sure I didn&#x27;t get a bad shave due to manufacturing defect on one of them. If you&#x27;re not worried about that, great pack</li>
    <li> Hopefully, i will be able to find the blades that i do like. Great way to be introduced to other international companies</li>
    <li> Are you shaving with a double edge razor, but you aren&#x27;t sure which blades you want to get? This will help you figure that out. Get a very wide variety of blades to try out and decide for yourself which ones you like best, or if there is even any difference at all. Then after you pick the brand you like, you can buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> As a guy that is new to traditional wet shaving, this sampler pack of different blades really helped me find the blade that works best for me.</li>
    <li> Too many fillers in this sampler, most of the Gillette blades were borderline unusable because they were so harsh. Otherwise good value for the variety.</li>
    <li> Enjoying testing the different brands to see what&#x27;s best for me. I like the Derby&#x27;s so far. If you are not sure, I would recommend the sampler set before you buy a 100 pack and find out they irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> This was awesome for a starter. Gave me a good chance to try a bunch of different brands. More of them worked well than didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> As a new DE razor user I wanted to indulge in the variety of blades to be found. After several months I can now say I&#x27;ve reached a point where I can tell the difference between many of these blades - and I&#x27;m surprised at that. They&#x27;re all good - but I can see how a person might develop a preference so this sampler kit is a good way to begin.</li>
    <li> Perfect for beginners to shaving with a safety razor. Personally I advise anyone purchasing this sampler pack to look up sharpness of blades and start with something more in the middle of the sharpness spectrum. Also don&#x27;t be afraid to change blades mid shave if the blade feels too dull or too sharp then it probably is.</li>
    <li> This blade sampler has a good range of blades at not too high of a price. The price per blade is high compared to buying a single brand in bulk, but that&#x27;s what you pay to trial many kinds. There are many blade samplers out there, this one is no better than the rest, but you have to stop shopping and get one at some point right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have noticed a difference between the blades, so I think the sampler was a good choice for me. I&#x27;ve been using each blade 3 times, taking notes, then moving to the next. I have about 4 blades left, but so far my favorites in this pack are: astra steel, trig silver edge, and supermax platinum. The merkur was very nice but I&#x27;ve seen it&#x27;s very expensive. The worst so far have been the bluebird and treet platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving like I am.</li>
    <li> I used to by the sharpest blades (feather), but they always messed up my face. The trick to get a perfect shave with the double edge system is to get something sharp enough to do the job but dull enough to leave your skin alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I used this package was to fist test each blade once and discard the ones that pulled or irritated my skin. Then I would have a second and a third round, keep discarding blades that went dull. This left me with only two blades by the end of the third round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not surprisingly, the winning blades were both made by Gillette, but do your own test to find the one you like best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more irritation.</li>
    <li> Perfect starter pack of blades if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving or just want to see what else is out there.  There are some nice blades and some okay blades in this pack but everyone has a different face so a razor I might not enjoy might be perfect for your face.  Definitely pick this up before you buy any blade in bulk.</li>
    <li> This is a really good sample pack.  Includes most of the &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; blades and a few of the lesser known brands.  The quality of the blade is purely subjective and, in my opinion, there is wide spectrum of blades in this pack.  Some are excellent - Astra, Feather, and Gillette - and some I threw away in after a single use.  That being, there should be something for everyone.  Highly recommend this pack.</li>
    <li> I am on the 4th blade out of this sample pack. So far there are more than just the derby&#x27;s that have numbered sides printed on blade. So far there has been really no big difference in the blades I have used so far on my face. They give a close shave about the first 2 - 3 uses of each edge then they start to dull and I have to shave a 2nd time to get a close shave or go until the next morning with a 5 o clock shadow. If I go too fast with razor I get nicked and/or razor burn(and that is with all of them so far). Each blade I have skipped a day of shaving and get some skin pull and razor burn. I have to shave daily  because my hair is like wire. Derby, Gillette, Treet, and currently Super max are the ones I have used so far. I will narrow it down to 2 or 3 brands and then buy a 5 pack of each of those to try, then make a final decision as to what will be my blade of choice. As some others have stated not everyone has the same skin, face or toughness of hair on face. So purchase this sampler pack, or one of the other sampler packs, to see what works best for your face and make your own decision before buying a bulk order of blades that you may end up throwing out because they are not the &amp;#34;ones&amp;#34; that&#x27;s best for your face.</li>
    <li> I needed a sampler for my new DE razor, and this works fine.  Only having two of each to try might have been a mistake as it might take a few more shaves with each brand to make a decision on what works best.  Anyone who has looked into these sampler pack knows that they are paying a high cost for someone basically buying these in bulk and shipping out in sample packs, but hey it is still cheaper than cartridge shaving.</li>
    <li> Some blades are good and some are not so good.  Better and cheaper to just look at reviews of blades online and order a couple of the higher rated ones.  Some of these blades seem like they are 5 shaves old when they are brand new.  Still it was a good lesson that not all blades are the same and you get what you pay for with them</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time and good condition. I like the chance to try a variety, my only wish is that the countries of origin were listed per brand on the amazon description.</li>
    <li> I had recently started shaving with a safety razor and saw a variety of reviews online for razors that made it difficult to chose a brand to commit to with a large number of razors. This provided the opportunity to try different razors to find which razor works best with my beard. With this pack I was able to narrow down to a couple of different brands that worked better with my beard than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best way to go when starting out in the safety razor world.</li>
    <li> This sampler is an excellent way to begin the search for *YOUR* ideal double edge blade. I bought this to narrow down to a few blades of which I plan to purchase a 5-pack of each to get a better comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll preface the individual blade comments with my beard type. I have a very thick/coarse, reddish beard with an especially thick portion around my chin. I knew coming in I would likely prefer a sharper blade, so with that in mind I tried to start with some blades that were likely more forgiving in order to hone my skills before getting to the sharper blades. FYI I’m using a late 50’s Gillette Rocket, more specifically a Parat, which is similar to a Super Speed and regarded as a relatively mild razor. I generally shave every other day so unless noted otherwise, my comments are based on two day growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here are *MY* thoughts on each blade in the order I tried them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Derby – Massive tug and pull for me. Couldn’t even get through one pass and finished with my Schick Hydro 5. Full disclosure… this was my first DE shave so that could have played a factor, but the ineffectiveness of cutting my chin hair does not bode well. These may be better in a more aggressive razor, so I’ll likely revisit down the road.&lt;br /&gt;2. Gilette Goal – Much better than the Derby when it comes to sharpness and thus significantly less tugging and pulling. Got a smooth shave on two days of growth with some irritation but not too bad. Significantly better on my chin area. I used this blade for two shaves with comparable results before moving on.&lt;br /&gt;3. Super-Max Stainless – Right there with the Derby. I finished the shave, but with noticeable irritation due to multiple passes to get all the hair cut. One use and I moved on.&lt;br /&gt;4. Super-Max Platinum – A little better than the stainless. I could feel the irritation afterward, but nothing visible. This could have to do with the fact I had 3 days of growth for this shave. Second shave with2 days of growth much the same. Got a smooth shave, but felt irritated afterward.&lt;br /&gt;5. Bic Chrome Platinum – NOW we’re talking! I finally found a blade sharp enough to cut through my chin hair with relative ease. It did leave my face a bit raw and irritated, but that could be due to either the rough shave of the Super-Max prior, or what I feel was a sub-par lather. Second shave left the similar raw feeling, but no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;6. Gillette 7 O’Clock Stainless (aka 7OC Green) – I’d say this blade is about as sharp as the Bic, maybe a bit less. That being said it was noticeably smoother for me. Cut through chin stubble no problem, and left a slight raw feeling which dissipated quickly. Second shave (3 days growth) revealed the sharpness went down a bit after the first shave as I had some irritation on my neck, but not too bad. Despite the bit of irritation I would say the second shave was smoother than the first, so I’ll chalk that up to technique.&lt;br /&gt;7. Gillette Silver Blue (GSB) – Although this blade felt a bit less sharp than the 7OC, it did seem smoother. Only 1.5 days growth, so the bit of tugging keeps the 7OC above this one IMO.&lt;br /&gt;8.  Gillette Nacet Stainless – Right there with Derby and the Super-Max’s with regard to sharpness. Decent shave, but left me very irritated on my neck. Now that I’ve felt some better blades for me, I’m starting to speed up the process for those that don’t give me a good shave. One and done… moving on.&lt;br /&gt;9. Gillette Nacet Platinum – Similar to the stainless, maybe worse. Had a lot of pulling even on my cheek, which was odd. Not for me.&lt;br /&gt;10. Trig – Not the sharpest, but pretty smooth as I was able to get a moderate shave with very little irritation. The lack of sharpness eliminated this for me as it would take too many passes to get a good, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;11. Treet – I was honestly surprised by this blade. Not incredibly sharp, but sharper that the Trig and definitely smoother. I’d put this right there with the Bic but behind the 7OC and GSB with regard to overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;12. Astra Superior Stainless – I was surprised by this one too… but not in a good way. Not very sharp, so it did not do a good job cutting through my facial hair. This blade gets good reviews, but it’s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;13. Astra Superior Platinum – Certainly better than the stainless. I’d put this one right there with the Treet as far as sharpness/smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;14. Bluebird – I honestly thought these would be sharper than what they were. I’d say these are pretty similar to the Treet/Astra SP… not very sharp but incredibly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;15. Feather – I honestly wanted to like this blade better than I do. As far as sharpness I’d put it there with the Bic and 7OC, with smoothness right between the two. It was definitely smoother on the second shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One quick note: they provided two Bluebirds as noted in the listing, thus only 15 blades reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I found the Gillette 7 O’Clock to be the best compromise of sharp and smooth for me followed closely by the GSB, Bic, Treet, Astra SP, and Feather. I honestly had no idea what to expect coming in, so it was indeed worthwhile to go through all of these blades in order to better identify my needs. I rated this four stars due to price and the fact they could&#x27;ve provided some better blade choices here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this helps potential buyers get an idea of how these blades shave before purchasing this sampler. My work isn’t done yet as there are plenty more blades out there to try. Specifically, I now have 5-packs of the 7OC Black and Yellow, Kai, Rapira Platinum Lux, and Crystal to go through, but I’ll keep it specific to these blades here.</li>
    <li> this sampler pack is great. You get a wide variety of razors. I was disappointed however, some of the best razors I cannot find anywhere.</li>
    <li> Good selection of various blades. If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving , this is the way to go. Allows you to decide which blade is right for you without having to purchase packs of each at a time.</li>
    <li> Nice selection of blades, a few I had not tried before. But a little pricy compared to samplers from other online sellers such as West Coast shaving. By comparison I just ordered 100 Astra blades for 10.94 on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this assortment to help me determine which blade works best for me. Having only begun using one it will be awhile becore I have an idea what to purchase regularly.</li>
    <li> For Christmas I got my boyfriend a safety razor, I bought these to go with it to give him some blade options</li>
    <li> Most of the razors in this pack are great. Make sure to pay attention and met which razors work will for you and which don&#x27;t. It was this pack that introduced me to the feather razors. A few in the pack were great, but the feather stood out to me and provided a shave that far exceeded that of the other razors in the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this if you are just getting into double edge shaving. The feather razor is great but it may not be good for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only just started shaving with a dbl-edge for the first time ever. This makes the decision as to what blade to perfer to shave with. I&#x27;ve only had time to try 3 different blades and I was surprised by the differences in those. It&#x27;ll take me awhile to try them all, but it&#x27;ll be worth it when I find the ONE I really like.</li>
    <li> great sampler package to get you started and choose whatever blade works for you, be aware that sharp doesn&#x27;t always mean better, especially if you are just getting started on safety razors</li>
    <li> Everything arrived as expected, thank you!</li>
    <li> I was able to find the blade that worked best for me, a good starter set for people new to de razors.</li>
    <li> Excellent sampling of double edge safety razor blades from around the world. Great for finding out which ones work best in your particular razor. Highly recommended for anyone who is getting into wet shaving.</li>
    <li> The first couple of blades I tried left me wanting. The third one was outstanding. The fourth gave me the best shave of my life, and the quickest. I won&#x27;t say which ones were best for me as every beard is different and the way I understand it you are not necessarily going to get the same mix as someone else. This is the best way to find out which blades work for you. I only give it four-stars because of the delivery time. It is excessive but there is nothing that can be done about that.</li>
    <li> This sample pack helped me choose which blade works best for me (I happen to prefer the Astra Platinum--there were 2 of them in here which helped reinforce my decision and I ultimately bought the 100-pack of them). The blades are all surprisingly different, which i didn&#x27;t expect! I liked a few of the other ones and had originally intended to go with Feather or Bluebird, but found this sampling really helped me fine tune my decision. Worth trying!</li>
    <li> This helped me determine the blade I found best for me. Since everyone likes different blades its a must to try out a sampler like this. I found that astra platinums are my favorite, with feathers a close second.</li>
    <li> I just started using a DE razor. I purchased this variety set of blades to figure out which brand works best for me. It was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I have not used one blade from this pack yet. I am basing this review on the simple fact that what was in the description of the product was provided to me properly (I&#x27;ve read too many reviews or people missing blades or having some exchanged for other blades not in the description).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received 16 blades, all tightly packed into a perfectly sized zip lock bag. So far, every blade seems to be in tact, but I have yet to remove the wax paper from any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only duplicate blade I received was the blue bird, and other than that, every blade in the description was provided to me in its own specific wax paper packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very new to DE shaving, and have been using the 5 pack of VDH blades included with my razor handle (purchased from target for $18.99 and definitely recommend). The VDH blades have provided me a very decent shave, getting a BBS shave with 3 passes. I have been using the VDH blades each about twice, but they tend to tug and pull even from first use, so I only use them twice and toss them. I have been using inferior products since starting and decided to make the full investment into the art of DE shaving as it makes economical sense, as well as quality sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can narrow these blades down to 2-3 top favorites, I will be very happy. I know some of these blades will tear up my face, and some of it will be due to user error, but I have not yet cut myself, and seem to be getting the feel of my blade now after about 15 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of these blades provides a different cutting angle and sharpness, and I&#x27;m looking forward to finding the one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the variety, I know some argue that other more popular blades were not included, but getting 15 different blades to make a choice is quite sufficient to me. $10, although I know there are 100 piece and other variety packs at different prices, wasn&#x27;t too steep for this purchase. I wanted to give multiple blades ashot, and not get stuck with 10 blades of one brand that are garbage to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep log of my ratings of each blade used, how many shaves I got from them, and other details and update this review once I have made the decision of which one is the one for me.</li>
    <li> still using this pack since ordered more than a year ago/</li>
    <li> these are just an assortment of blades....yet...you WILL get a very nice variety to see which one truly matches your face and shaving technique...DEFINITELY purchase a variety pack of blades so you&#x27;ll know which one to invest your money into</li>
    <li> I just recently brought the sampler and I was not completely satisfied and my reason was the blades were extremely DULL. My fast growing facial hair causes me to shave 2xs a day and I used all of them which was a disappointment. Even the feather blade that alot of people spoke about being &amp;#34;killer sharp&amp;#34; didnt even cut my facial hair. I have very coarse facial hair and I thought that the feather would just sliced right thru but no avail. I will not buy this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I believe maybe the seller needs to throw away products that are 6 months old. I believe that will help alot. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I only got 15 blades. I didn&#x27;t get either of the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock blades, but instead received a Gillette Silver Blue blade.</li>
    <li> Great way to try out a variety of blades for both newcomers (myself) and veterans alike.  This sampler was great for me, a new guy to the safety razor world.  I get to try out a bunch of different blades, see what works best, and then compare my list of &amp;#34;bests&amp;#34; against prices and shop smarter going forward.  I&#x27;m about 1/3 of the way through the sampler and it&#x27;s been good so far.  I&#x27;m sure a veteran using the same brand for a while would similarly find value in this sampler as it gives you great variety without spending a bunch on each brand.</li>
    <li> A mixed bag of razors means you get just that.  Definitely recommend a sampler if you&#x27;ve never used double edged razors before to see what you like</li>
    <li> This is a great idea if you are testing a new DE razor. Not all blades shave the same in a razor or for the individual. excellent opportunity to find the right blade that works for you.</li>
    <li> Definitely check this out if you want to test drive a bunch of blades for cheap! I got this as a beginner to shaving with a double edge razor and I&#x27;m hoping to find a favorite amongst all this variety, Would recommend</li>
    <li> It had a lot of crappy samples. Only a few of the blades were sharp and worth buying, the rest were poor quality.</li>
    <li> Did I like all the blades...no. That&#x27;s the point though. This collection helped me find which blades I liked, and a few that I loathed. Now I can find a larger package of the blade I prefer.</li>
    <li> This is a great sampler if you&#x27;re just getting into the world of single-blade shaving and don&#x27;t know what kind of blade you prefer. For my money, the harder/thicker blades have less give and give you a closer shave, but you have to be a little more careful while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I&#x27;m back to my Mach 3. As many websites dedicated to this old-school method of shaving point out, their goal is not a clean shave but a &amp;#34;beard reduction.&amp;#34; They say that you need multiple shaves in order to get really close, and they are right. I don&#x27;t have time for multiple shaves in the morning though! If you&#x27;re looking for a relatively quick, super close shave, you&#x27;re going to have to stick with that 3, 5, or 27 blade contraption you already have, even though the replacement blades cost an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> This pack has a good variety with 2 of each blade but, I found it hard to remember exactly how each compares to another, with just 2 blades of each model. I do feel most blades are similar although some blades last longer than others.  At first I tried changing blades daily but after 7 days each and a few blades there was no way I could remember how I felt about each blade, partly because they were all so similar. I tried keeping notes but sometimes they got lost and/or just cluttered my bathroom and I had used razor blades all over and didn&#x27;t want me or anyone else getting cut especially trying to get them out of my drawer.  Then I tried using each blade for a week but it made it even harder to remember all the other blades. I felt all that work was too OCD so I quit tallying.  By the time I wore out one blade the print on the razor blade had worn off somehow and most labeling does not indicate the exact model anyway so 2 different models of the same brand could not be differentiated.  If I needed to shave 3 times a day and I tossed them before they were used up I could probably determine the best blades, or another option would be to use 5 or 10 of each blade in a row and then change models to more easily notice the performance differences. I generally shave once per day and occasionally shave after 2 days so I have not used the whole pack in 6 months.  For my face, I get small cuts around my mouth and chin trying to cut all of my stubble, new blade or not, Gillette Mach 3 or whatever but, I don&#x27;t get big cuts and rarely have noticeable scabs and those rinse off easily.  No matter how much I shave I still have stubble on my neckline and upper lip so I finish up with a standard safety razor for my tough areas on my upper lip for less cuts. Using both razors, the common safety razor lasts a lot longer.  I would like to try an adjustable pitch double edge razor I had seen.  If someone has a better way to test each blade I&#x27;d like to know how. As of October 2014 I still have not come to a good decision on blade differences so for me I&#x27;m not thrilled by the sample pack and it costs more.</li>
    <li> Razor blades used in a safety razor make a huge difference from one brand to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading reviews of blades some people love some brands and some people hate some brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll never know which will work best for you unless you try them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally found the Feather Platinum, and Astra Platinum to be the best of the bunch.</li>
    <li> Perfect for trying to figure out your blades.</li>
    <li> love this idea of being able to try different blades before buying a bunch of them, some are good some not so good, and some start out great, and just don&#x27;t last.  Not done trying they all, but I think I found my favorite already with the gillette stainless</li>
    <li> This assortment gave me the opportunity to try a wide variety of blades.  Amazing how many different brands and types represented.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that some of the blades didn&#x27;t seem to even make it through half a week, whereas the better blades were still sharp after a week of shaving.  Give wet shaving a try and save some money over buying those expensive cartridge blades.  This is a good inexpensive assortment to try it out.</li>
    <li> There were other kits that had more blades overall, but this had more blade variety and included more of the brands I wanted to try. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Did the trick. I found &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; blade in this pack. Some are great blades and some are awful.... but to each their own.</li>
    <li> I do wish more than one of each blade had been included. However, I did find that I really liked Feathers and Gilette&#x27;s, so thanks for giving me a place to start.</li>
    <li> Also try Shark and Personna.</li>
    <li> There are some very good blades in this sample pack. There are also some that you will be dissatisfied with. It&#x27;s hard to rate the pack on its contents because every blade performs differently on each persons face. For example, I haven&#x27;t tried all the blades yet, but the Bluebirds and Vidyut Supermax gave me razor burn. However, the Astra SP gave me an excellent shave with no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pack itself is exactly as described and contains a wide variety of blades from economy line to premium blades. If you are new to wet shaving, I recommend you try a sampler pack before you commit to a large quantity of DE blades. You have to decide which blade works well for you.</li>
    <li> some of the blades-brands are really junk! Should not be even sold!</li>
    <li> Some great razors, some bad. Really depends on your skin type so it&#x27;s a great way for people new to safety razors to try some out and see what works for them.</li>
    <li> I recommend this sampler to anyone who wishes to test out different blades.  Most of the blades are exceptional with little to no difference.  It is definitely up to the user to decide which is best.  I have my own idea now and will compare prices.</li>
    <li> I would deffently recommend buying a combo pack with different types if razor blades because not ever blade works the same for every guy. Half of the blades in this pack didn&#x27;t work with my face but the others did and I narrowed down what one worked best and purchased it in bulk.</li>
    <li> This helped me dial in my regular blade.</li>
    <li> Bought these after getting tired of the feather blades which I used after first starting with DE shaving. Everyone had said the feather blades were amazing, and they delivered a good shave but unfortunately always left me with razor burn and a lot of Knicks. And everyone always recommended one of these sample packs to find a blade for your face, so I went ahead and bought it. Best decision ever. I can immediately tell which blades I will be buying more of and which ones I won&#x27;t. They&#x27;ve helped me choose a new favorite blade (So far BIC Chrome Platinum) and others that I&#x27;ve loved as well. Definitely recommend if you are starting out and don&#x27;t know which blade is for you. Buy this before buying a large pack of one brand that you might end up hating.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good variety, but I found out very quickly that, for me, most of these blades are terrible. Tore my face to shreds. It seems that the only blades that are nice to my face are the Gillette blades in this pack. But if you&#x27;re unsure of which blades to get, give it a shot. Everyone&#x27;s face is different.</li>
    <li> I am giving this set five stars because I discovered Gillette Silver Blue blades as a result.  If you are starting out with DE shaving, you may need to try out 12 brands of blades before you find the one that suits you best.  Some of the blades in this pack, Blue Birds come to mind, absolute shredded my face.  Others like Astra and Nacet were not so bad.  Buy this pack, find what works for you, and go with that.  See if I am not right about the Silver Blues.  Feathers are also very decent.  Anyway, it is fun to try the different blades - and yes, each of them has its own personality.</li>
    <li> Gives you a good place to start when trying to figure out which blade someone prefers.</li>
    <li> My husband has been very happy with the variety pack.  It is the best way to find your favorite blade or blades.</li>
    <li> Nice Variety for the beginner or vet who wants to try something new.</li>
    <li> Wide variety inside.  There are some good blades and some junk ones.  I wish I would have just bought another pack of Derby&#x27;s instead.</li>
    <li> This kit gives you enough blades to get started, once you find a brand that works for you,buy it and use it until you get experienced. Then go back and try the rest. This is good place to start when you have no experience at DE shaving.</li>
    <li> This set is your basic starter package.  One blade of each brand to give you an idea of what you would like.  It helped me make a bulk order purchase.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and I think it is great for someone that is not familar with the differences in blades. It helped him find the one he likes best.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard not to love a sample pack that does what it purports to do.  A great selection of blades, it really helped me narrow down my personal preferences coming from a &amp;#34;cutthroat&amp;#34; to a safety razor.  It&#x27;s possible that they threw in a few extra for me to enjoy as well, and that doesn&#x27;t hurt either.  It was truly surprising how different some of these blades feel.</li>
    <li> Nice way to try a wide variety of razors to see what works best.</li>
    <li> Package did NOT include Gillette Silver Blue blade as shown in photo.  Major reason I ordered this package was my desire to test the Gillette Silver Blue blade.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a blade sampler guys. But a good, affordable sampler, with a wide enough selection that I usually can buy this same sampler again and find a new blade to try out each time. I&#x27;m happy with the product(s) and the price- what more can you say?</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re new to the safety razor (as I was a few months ago), there&#x27;s no better way to learn what brand of razor best suits you than this sample pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack is a little pricier per razor than a bulk order of a single brand, but it&#x27;s worth it to find the one you like best. I&#x27;ve looked up reviews of these individual brands, and it&#x27;s clear that every man&#x27;s shaving style, skin, hair, and personal preferences differ. Some have given 1-star reviews for the brand I liked the most, while others have given 5-star reviews to razors that left red streaks across my face and stubble under my chin. What you&#x27;re paying for here is a learning experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breaking down my review into reviews of the individual types of razors would defeat the purpose. Buy this pack, and take mental notes while shaving.</li>
    <li> Some good some bad and some extremly bad.  This sampler only got 3 stars becaue I feel they included way too many sub par blades for a good review.  I went with the astra blades as my choice blade.</li>
    <li> get it and find out what works best for you</li>
    <li> Absolutely necessary for new de shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started de shaving and followed many many forums advice and got a blade sampler. I couldn&#x27;t believe in the difference in performance between brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the middle of the road blades, the astra sp and the gillette silver blur were the best for me givingn me the closest possible shave with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feather and the derby were each on opposite ends of the sharpness spectrum and both irritates my face and resulted in razor burns and bumps.  Get a sampler!!</li>
    <li> I loved to try all the different brands</li>
    <li> Exactly as described looking forward to this sampler of blades!</li>
    <li> Great way to try out a bunch of different blades. There is definitely a difference between them and what may work for one may not for another. For my own testing I gave a letter grade and a short review for each blade. As I said this was what worked for me. Some people swear by the feathers and the derby blades but I found the blue birds to be best for my setup.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the complete listing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Bird stainless - great first shave no irritation and smooth. managed to get 4-5 great shaves out of this blade. A+&lt;br /&gt;Astra Superior Stainless - first shave was close with some cuts, I was really trying to get a close shave - some irritation. Second and third shave has been good. some minor irritation. - A&lt;br /&gt;Astra Platniun - good but not as good as the stainless  A-&lt;br /&gt;Gillete nacet stainless - first shave pretty good. second shave pretty good as well A-&lt;br /&gt;Bic chrome platnium  Lasted a long time, pretty decent shaves B+&lt;br /&gt;Supermax platnium - first two shaves not that close and some tugging. , overall meh B-&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Goal stainless - ok shave not great B-&lt;br /&gt;Gillete Silver blue stainless - I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but a pretty decent blade I was able to get four good shaves with minimal irritation. B&lt;br /&gt;Nacet platnium - decent but not great shave gave up after three shaves - C&lt;br /&gt;Treet platnium super stainless - lots of pull and cuts. D-&lt;br /&gt;Derby extra - lots of tugging and not great shave stopped after 3 shaves. F&lt;br /&gt;Supermax - super sucks F&lt;br /&gt;Treet Platinum super statinless - Not a treet, lots of pulling, nicks and irritation F</li>
    <li> Good way to try different blades to find the right one for yourself but many blades are poor quality. Best off just sticking with the Bic or Gillette. They were far better than the rest.</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving and didn&#x27;t know where to start IRT blades.  I tried each blade for a few days.  Trust me, you can tell a difference quickly.  My favorites were the Feather and BlueBird Platinums.</li>
    <li> I really liked this razor blade set! I have been shaving with a DE razor for a year now and just used the blades that came with my razor. I wanted to broaden my horizon a bit to the other brands and this is a great way to do that.</li>
    <li> Only  used one, so far so good</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave this pack two stars is because they ALMOST included all of the blades listed in the description. The following were inconsistent with the description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. There were two Gillette NACET Stainless blades instead of one Platinum and one Stainless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There were two SuperMax Super Stainless blades instead of one Stainless and one Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. There was only one Gillette 7o&#x27;clock blade instead of 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s not a huge deal, as they still sent me 16 blades, but the whole point of a sample pack is to get one of each blade to find out which one works best for my face. If you list something as included in the purchase, you need to make sure those exact items make it into the bag. If you run out of a specific blade you need to change the description instead of just shipping a different product in it&#x27;s place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than substituted blades, everything else  seems to be just fine. They all seem to be brand new, individually wrapped in their factory wax paper wrappings and ready to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on about my 5th razor and I have zero complaints. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in the razors I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s still nice to see what&#x27;s out there. I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase, but I think next time i&#x27;ll just buy a 100-count pack of 1 brand.</li>
    <li> Product as it is shown.</li>
    <li> Some kind of blade sampler is essential for anyone just starting out with a DE razor.  I&#x27;m only about halfway through the pack, but the differences between each blade (even from the same manufacturer) are pretty amazing.  For example, I found the Gillette 7&#x27;oclock to be smooth and sharp, but the Gillette Goal was horribly dull -- barely better than the Bic, which was so dull I had to toss it after just a few strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is a sampler so important?  Just read the reviews here.  One other found the Bic to be just fine.  Nothing wrong with that, this is about getting a good result on your own face, not another&#x27;s.  You can&#x27;t find out what works for you without trying different blades.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to test the various blades to determine which are the best for ones shaving needs. Several were not as sharp as the others,but all in all this gave me a chance to test each blade. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a good options for starters. Lets you choose what type of blade fits your needs best. Not to mention you save yourself some money instead of going to the regular razors. Using this blades with a Merkur heavy durty double edge razor #34c.</li>
    <li> I bought this sampler to compare some of the different blade brands and models. I expected there to be some differences if even slight between them. Nada. Can&#x27;t tell a difference between any of them...  so back to the cheapest thing I can find. While there is nothing wrong with any of these blades my advice is find the cheapest blades you can find on Amazon and buy them by the 500 lot. If you use one blade a day and skip a few here and there your good for two years.</li>
    <li> Great variety for beginners to choose from.</li>
    <li> This was a good start for me . So far I like the astra. Havent went through them all yet. I would recomend this to a friend .</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a DE razor after having used electrics for 50 years.  Choosing the blade that works for you with the razor you choose is more than half the battle.  This assortment makes it a lot easier.</li>
    <li> It is what it is, a sample pack of blades, I have gone through all my blue birds and loved them. They got close but still did not tear me up to bad. The 7 o clocks worked pretty decently too, I havent tried them all yet but I say all in all it is a good way to find what blades work for your razor.</li>
    <li> I have used this to determine which blades I want to use everyday. Experimenting helped and I owe it to the sampler!</li>
    <li> This variety pack let me try almost every popular blade. The best part is that the higher end popular blades weren&#x27;t even the best on my face, I ended up going with a cheap blade. I would have only figured that out from getting this variety pack.</li>
    <li> A little expensive, but a good way to sample a wide variety of blades. All the blades were new and in good condition.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m still on the first blade, but I like the idea of having a selection to try without buying5 or ten blade packs.</li>
    <li> blades were shipped loose in a little plastic bag. I almost discarded them. The assortment was good.</li>
    <li> Great variety of blades to try.</li>
    <li> Just started using a DE razor.. This is a great way to try different blades to see what works best for you.</li>
    <li> Just bought a safety razor? Don&#x27;t know what blade to invest in for the next several years with your 100+ count order? Need to switch from your current razors and want to test some first? Get these there are some quality razors here and some terrible ones but what may work for me might not for your skin type. Try these out and you will not be disappointed...except with a few blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally had the best shaves with the gillette silver and astra feather.</li>
    <li> I bought this sampler because I was new to wet shaving and wanted to try some blades to figure out what was best for me. The first thing that  you realize when shopping for samplers is that it is by far the more expensive way to purchase double-edge (DE) blades. These 16 blades are easily more expensive than 100-count boxes of many of the constituent brands. Still, it&#x27;s work a little extra to find out what you want to slide across your face every day. This box contains several quality brands such as Derby, Gillette, Astra, and Feather. It even contains the stainless and platinum versions of most of these products, which was nice because there is a difference for most people. What would make it better? The lack of the other 50% of the blades, which are arcane and very cheap blades that are, for the most part, not even worth trying. But it&#x27;s a sampler, right? Well, yes, but these blades gave (me, at least) a consistently mediocre shave. If that&#x27;s all you care to get, then don&#x27;t bother buying a sampler and just buy a 100 box of one of the cheap brands and be done with it. I would rather have seen the inclusion of several of the other Gillette lines, as well as a few Sword and Personna products. Overall, though, it was ok and was as described.</li>
    <li> HAVE TRIED TWO DIFFERENT BLADES SO FAR THIS IS THE CHEAPEST WAY TO FIND WHITCH ONE IS BEST FOR MY FACE FIRST GAVE 6 SHAVES (FEATHER)</li>
    <li> I recommend this to anyone looking to get into DE shaving. Each razor, each blade, and each person&#x27;s face is different. It is important to find the right fit. I personally love the Feather and Astra blades.</li>
    <li> Well, just starting out with my Merkur 180 and ordered this set of blades.  Have tried the Astra and have never had a closer shave ever.</li>
    <li> Fantastic option for those new to using a safety razor.  I recommend keeping a log of how you like each razor so you know which one to purchase a lot of once you&#x27;ve tried them all.  I also recommend using the Feather razor last after you&#x27;ve got your technique down because that thing will slice your face off if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
    <li> Definitely some 1 star blades in there, but that&#x27;s the point! I got this and a couple other samples to see what worked best for me when switching to wet shaving. Astra SP and Feather won out, but that&#x27;s not going to be the case for everyone. I actually rotated each blade on an every other day trial for a total of 3 shaves, with 1, 2, and 3 pass trials... noting the results in Evernote after each shave (and elimination). Nerd alert! Hey, it helped me decide definitively so I could save a lot on going ahead and getting a 100 pack of the victor!</li>
    <li> When I switched to a safety razor, I didn&#x27;t know which brand of blade I wanted to use. I don&#x27;t have to shave very often, so this sample pack has lasted me quite a while. The Astras haven&#x27;t seemed to work well with my face, but the Feather and Gillettes are pretty great. I highly recommend this or another sample pack if you decide to make the switch do DE razor blades. Also, the price beats any cartridge razor out there.</li>
    <li> A good variety to choose the blade that you will like.  Start with one and go through them.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong here. If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving or just looking for a different blade, this sampler contains a large variety and includes some of the most popular blades on the market. If you&#x27;re in need of a new style of blade, this sampler is a must have! Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> Came in great condition, all as advertised, looks like it contains most of the blades they say beginners should try. Glad to have two Bluebirds so I can learn DE shaving on one before truly evaluating the blades themselves.</li>
    <li> There are a couple of excellent reviews posted that give an expanded and detailed report of the various blades included in this sample kit.  They were very helpful when I was making my initial purchase.  Suffice it to say that the variety of blades included in this package can provide ample opportunity to see what each specific brand has to offer in the way of a decent daily shave experience.  I had been away from the double edge system for quite a few years and needed to get beyond a one-brand mentality.  There are definitely differences in blades &amp; I was able to narrow down my own preferences to one specific brand.  That would not have been possible without a sample kit.</li>
    <li> Great sampler for any beginner to the DE shaving world.&lt;br /&gt;Included 17 razors total, and had an excellent variety to fit any type of hair/skin.&lt;br /&gt;What works for some may not work for you, so this is a great way to figure out what you like before you drop a bunch ($20) on a years worth of blades.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, good blades</li>
    <li> Nice assortment. I tried the going retro on the saving with a safety razor, but in the end the modern cartridge razors work better and are less prone to cutting.</li>
    <li> wanted to sample the different razor blades out there. this is a good way to sample them, i think it could be cheaper though.</li>
    <li> I never got far through this pack...seems like a lot of mediocre filler razors.  Once I got to the feather razor I stopped, and bought a 100pack of feather blades.</li>
    <li> Will update when I use them all.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, this sampler pack is a great deal. You&#x27;re able to test many different blades and find the right one for you. I highly recommend this pack.</li>
    <li> When getting started, or re-starting with, a double edge razor (DE) one thing that you have to experience is the use of various blades.  Each blade will be a bit different so you must learn what works for you by experiencing them.  While there are several blade sample packages, this one gives you just one of each for a low price.  I like that.  If I don&#x27;t like a blade, why do I want 3-5 of them.  I chose this one so I could test them quickly, settle on the one I like, and order that brand.  Trials are on going.</li>
    <li> Nice variety of razors. Excited to try them all. Great products in the line-up! Future selections will be made from the variety bought</li>
    <li> A good start but there are more interesting sample packs out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty terrible with my safety razor still, So I pretty much nick myself differently with each brand of blade.So far prefer the Atstra and Feather. Great way to find what ya like the most.</li>
    <li> A very nice verity of DE blades for a Bigenner with a safty razor for the price.</li>
    <li> i love this sample pack. ive bought it twice now. after the first time i decided my favorites were both the astras. the gillette 7 o&#x27;clocks are great as well although probably the most dull of all the blades. (still way sharp enough to work just smooooth)</li>
    <li> If you are new to safety razors, this is a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each face and beard is different and will respond differently to different blade types. This gives you an opportunity to test various types and see how each one feels. Some were terrible and didn&#x27;t cut others were way to sharp caused a lot of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up really likely the Treet, Astra, and Supermax and ended up buying 100 of the supermax. I would have had no idea what to buy otherwise. I would say the Supermax is a 7/10 sharp and a 5/10 forgiving. The feather is by far the sharpest but killed my face if I had to rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. Check out the Edwin Jagger safety razors to pair.</li>
    <li> Great set to figure out which blades work for you. Ended up loving the ASTRA Superior Platinum. Getting a very good shave every morning!</li>
    <li> I am new to shaving with double edged razors, and after reading a few reviews decided to order this sampler. I&#x27;ve only had the opportunity to use 5 of the blades so far. I started with the Feather because I read decent reviews. It was, however, a very stiff blade and left me with irritation on my neck and lots of cuts. It was a very close shave and left my face smooth, but was too close of a shave for my liking. I used it about 3 times before replacing with the Derby Extra blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derby Extra blade was awesome for me. It gave me a good clean shave with no irritation and not nicks/cuts at all. I realize that blades are personal preference, and this blade performed to my liking. I got about 5 good shaves before I replaced it with the Blue Bird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blue Bird blade was a good close shave, too, but for some reason cut me up more than the Feather. I used that one twice and chucked it for the Gillette Goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Goal blade was a good comfortable shave that did not irritate my skin, but by the second time I used it I could feel that it had gotten dull. It was pulling my skin as I shaved. Weird feeling. I used that twice only and tossed it for the Bic blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bic blade was surprisingly smooth and gave me a good clean shave. I don&#x27;t have a negative comment about this blade. It is up there with the Derby Extra blade as far as smooth shave, comfort and feel. I used this blade twice and replaced it with the Astra Superior Stainless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Astra Superior gave me a good comfortable shave, no dragging or nicks. There was some irritation in my neck area, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I think it is better than the Bic blade, and up there with the Derby. I still have this blade in my razor and have used it twice. The blade still feels sharp, and I plan on using it a few more times before replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the blades I&#x27;ve used so far, I have decided that the Derby Extra is the right blade for me. So much so, that I ordered the 100 count box two days ago. Mainly, because of the lack of irritation on my neck. Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stated before, blade choice is subjective and personal. Others have said what works for them may not work for you, and I wholly agree with this sentiment. This was a good purchase that led me to my preferred choice of the Derby blade. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have been going through the selected brands one by one, two I have already locked out of competetion, I have one that I like so far &amp;#34;Astra&amp;#34; but I have 13 more to go!</li>
    <li> Great variety of blades. Good idea if you are just starting out and trying to find a blade for you. Comes packaged in a little ziplock bag. Love that a key is included to know where each blade originates from. Purchased two sets as gifts. Wish all the information wasn&#x27;t super taped to the bag, couldn&#x27;t even see it was blades, but it came off easy enough. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades were just what I needed. I&#x27;ve only tried the feather thus far, and I found that it completely altered my shaving experience. I look forward to giving the other blades a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a DE safety for a while now and thing I can tell you is that not all DE blades are created equal and everyone&#x27;s skin is different. Some brands will be better on your face than others, you really should experiment with what&#x27;s out there. Samplers like these are great when your trying to figure out which blades are best for your face, without buying a five or a ten pack blades that give you cuts or razor burn.</li>
    <li> All these blades really do shave a differently so it&#x27;s helpful to try a wide variety when you start using a safety razor. I&#x27;m about half way through and now I know a handful of blades I want to use now.</li>
    <li> Some bad, some good, some great. Easy to determine what your face needs,</li>
    <li> Good sampler pack. I have a very course beard and so far have only shaved with my razor twice. I used the derby first as I heard it was a mild blade and got through a whole shave using both sides of the blade. It was a little dull for me personally. However I still only nicked myself twice and had a little irritation on my neck area. Not to bad for the first time ever shaving with a safety razor I&#x27;d say. Today I used the Gillette silver blue and had a much better time with it. Had a single nick but overall it was a much better blade for me and was able to use one side to get through the whole shave. I plan on using the astra followed by the feather next. I personally think one of these three blades will end up being my go to in the near future. One thing I can even after having only shaved twice is how remarkably better my face feels. I would get mild acne shaving with a regular razor (no surprise there considering it&#x27;s hold bacteria from past shaves.) However I notice now not only do I get a better/closer shave. Overall when I&#x27;m done my face just feels better. I&#x27;m hoping the slight irritation on my neck is just due to my technique or blade which I&#x27;m sure it is. Even with that though my face feels cleaner and much much smoother since I started shaving with a safety. This sampler is a must to find out what blade is right for you. the only reason I give it four stars is the price and I think it would be better if there were two blades from each brand. Just incase you get a total lemon you&#x27;re not judging the brand based on a bad egg. Anyway I&#x27;m super happy I&#x27;m shaving with a DE now and think anyone on the fence should take the plunge. You&#x27;ll be happy you did!</li>
    <li> The last few times I tried to buy razor blades at  a major box store were rather disappointing.  The blades were moved behind lock and key and I had to ring a bell for service, then go to the pharmacy to get someone paged over to open the display.  The last time, I rang the bell and gave up after one minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon to the rescue. Ordering is simple to do. This blade sampler pack gives me a good idea of what is available. My next blade purchase will also be from Amazon. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Still trying out the different blades, but there does seem to be a difference. Stick with what works for you.</li>
    <li> I am new to shaving with an old fashion razor system and I have to say it is the best decision I have made recently. Ordering this sample set of razors is the second best. It has let me make a better choice for my shaving needs. Since everybody has a different skin and hair type it is best to do your own trials. I highly recommend it if you are still trying to get that perfect shave.</li>
    <li> Great assortment of blades so I could see which was best for me and my face so I knew which to buy</li>
    <li> ...but then again, you&#x27;d expect nothing less from a Sample pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m relatively new to shaving with a double-edged safety blade.  Some blades are more forgiving with my relative newness than some, while others would just as soon shred my face as safely remove the hair.  Chalk most of this up to experience...  But the fact is that one blade, properly cared for, should last several shaves.  I shave every day, and the Derby blade has lasted me at least 2 weeks.  Maybe I&#x27;m pushing my luck, but it&#x27;s still giving me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> New to this type of razor blade. Glad there is a sample pack, so I can try several without buying 100 blades only to find I do not like one. I have not tried all the blades yet, but happy with Derby razor I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> An excellent and  cost efficient wayto find the right blade for yourself</li>
    <li> Great selection of blades to try in order to find which is best for me.  Would recommend to all looking for the perfect blade</li>
    <li> I got exactly what is described. A nice assortment of quality blades. Nothing more and nothing less.  These are some nice blades that could be had for a lower cost if purchased in bulk. But this is not bulk. It&#x27;s a sampler pack and still much less expensive than the same quantity of Mach 3 or Fusion cartridges.</li>
    <li> First time using a safety razor and buying packs like these are definitely helpful to figuring out which blades are best for each person.</li>
    <li> I used a DE razor about 10 years ago and decided to start using it again (cartridge costs are ridiculous now).  This variety pack of blades is great to figure out what works for you.  I only heard of Gilette, Feather, and BIC; and I&#x27;m not going to lie but I was a little worried about the other blades.  Here is a quick review on the blades I&#x27;ve tried so far, and hope to update this later as well.  I have a coarse beard and shave every 1 or 2 days.    Merkur (came with my razor): tore my face up, lots of pull and nics.  Bluebird: great sharpness and gave a really close shave with (3-4 uses, 1 and 2 day growth); so far my favorite  Derby: Ok blade, but didn&#x27;t get as close as I would like (3 uses)  Vidyut Super-Max Stainless: I was surprised by this and felt comparable to Bluebird (3 uses, 1 and 2-day growth)  Gillette Goal: crap, did one stroke and felt so dull  Nacet Platinum: doesn&#x27;t get as close like Bluebird or Vidyut, pull was noticeable on the third use and burn.  Gillette Silver Blue:  Lots of residue/glue on the blade from the packaging. Not a bad shave, similar to Super-Max Stainless, a couple nics  Other Gillette blades: crap except for Silver Blue  Super-Max Platinum: real nice blade, clean shave  Nacet Platinum: good quality shave    You pay a premium for the 16 blades, but it&#x27;s better to know what blade suits you.</li>
    <li> Good pack of blades. Some blades were terrible me but that is the point of getting a sampler. Still believe in my feather blades</li>
    <li> Husband loved the set. Good variety.</li>
    <li> Good price, nice selection.  Tip I found on another site, keep a index card and rate each blade after 3 shaves so you have an idea of which ones you would prefer to order separately.</li>
    <li> This great sampler of blades contains some high quality blades, run of the mill average blades, and some real stinkers. It gives a good base line comparison for those starting out wet shaving. *** For those beginners reading all the long, verbose reviews about the art of shaving -- skip &#x27;em. It isn&#x27;t rocket science and the learning curve isn&#x27;t all that steep. If you don&#x27;t do a 4 pass shave with your Mach Fusion, you&#x27;re not going to need to do one with a DE razor.</li>
    <li> ONIY WAY TO START OUT.</li>
    <li> This was a great variety pack of DE blades. I found my favorite blades (Astra SP, Feather) from this assortment of blades. So it was well worth the purchase. If you&#x27;re just getting into DE shaving, and not sure which blades to buy, get this variety pack and find your favorites.</li>
    <li> Great sampler to decide on a final blade suited for you.</li>
    <li> I am new to wet shaving and I didn&#x27;t want to cut my face up, so I took others&#x27; advice to get a trial pack. I looked for the least sharp blade (by reviews) in the pack to make sure I knew the right technique. (I started with the Derby). It worked well and I&#x27;m continuing to work my way through to see which is best for me. Great way to start. No cuts yet.    **Update** I just finished using this sampler pack. (Started February 14 and ended October 22) It was a good introduction to wet shaving. Some I was pleased with (most notably the Feather, Astras and to a lesser degree BIC) and lasted a month for me. Some others weren&#x27;t very good at all, but over 8 months of shaving for this price is a win to me.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Nice to have options without buying each separately.</li>
    <li> Great selection. Hard to tell which blade I like the most. Lost of good choices in this kit.</li>
    <li> This product is needed for a new wet shaver!</li>
    <li> This pack offers a wide variety of blades to help you zero in on one for your face and beard.  As you may already know, blades vary a great deal from each company, and a blade that works great for me might not work for you at all, and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMHO, there are a few duds in this pack, but you do get to try most of the truly popular brands (Gillette, Astra, Bic, Feather, Derby).  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I really liked this sample pack.  It was perfect for me.  I found blades I really liked and wanted to buy and some that I didn&#x27;t like so much and now I know not to buy those blades.  Very nice sample pack indeed.</li>
    <li> Bought my boyfriend a beautiful double-edge razor for Christmas that included one blade. Because he had never shopped for single blades before, buying the sampler has been a great way for him to try different blades and each of these lasts a while. He&#x27;s only on his 4th blade in a little over 2 months and still has 12 more he can use.</li>
    <li> This sampler pack is great. Love the variety of blades. Feather was indeed a sharp blade but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Good sample pack for new Safety Razor Shavers.  I do think it is missing some of the more popular blades that a beginner would want to try, such as the various Personna brands.</li>
    <li> I bought these along with my first double edge razor and did not know which blade to buy after some research everybody has a different favorite that&#x27;s because everybody has different hair so give it a shot and find your perfect blade .</li>
    <li> Came well packaged as described.</li>
    <li> Most of these were unusable for me and a lot didn&#x27;t really hold up for more than a shave or two, but it offered a very broad selection and there were a few gems in there, which I immediately bought more of once I found out what I liked.  Definitely recommend this product for anyone just getting into DE shaving, it was a life-saver!</li>
    <li> Was checking out the variety of razors for my husbands new double blade razor. He liked the options and is finding his favorite for future purchases.</li>
    <li> I got the two Astra blade types (stainless and platium) in a sample kit; they are the worst of the dozen or so types I&#x27;ve tried. The first few blade strokes are usually okay, by the 3rd or 4th stroke I get small nicks, and, on the last try before throwing away 8 packages of these blades, one of them peeled my upper lip like a grape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I don&#x27;t see how anyone shaves with them. The Derby blades are pretty bad too.</li>
    <li> I am new to the double-edged razors which our recent ancestors used to use and find I get my closest shaves with this method.  Started on Derby blades, which are fine, but wanted to see what else is out there. This sampler pack made me realized that Derby is a great mainstream blade, as some of the off-brands in this pack ranged from good to not-so-good.</li>
    <li> Not a bad starter pack. I use one blade per shave. You can get 2-3 shaves out of some, but I prefer a sharp shave every time. A decent assortment. I actually got 17, as 2 blades were stuck by an adhesive. A good way to get used to this type of shave!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong. Try them all</li>
    <li> This is perfect for someone like me who is looking for the perfect blade. I have found three that I really like and 13 that made me look like I had my throat cut open.</li>
    <li> Different kinds of blades, all solid quality and have given me close shaves and was shipped to my apartment very quickly. For people who are new to DE shaving this is one of the best buys. Low cost and a variety of brands.</li>
    <li> items as described.  good way to sample a variety of blades.</li>
    <li> Nothing to say, I just got them, but it will keep my face smooth for the next few months.</li>
    <li> A decent sampler!  And I&#x27;ve found that one really does needto shop around with different blades; there really is a huge difference.  One star deducted for the higher price, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter addition to see what razor blades works well for your face.  With 16 different brands you should be able to find the prefect fit.  I found the ones that we the platinum series tended to be better.</li>
    <li> The variety of blades that came in this set were great quality. I would recommend this set so that you can find the brand that is right for you.</li>
    <li> I purchase this sample pack because I felt like it was the best bang for my buck.  The pack comes with a variety of razors. Which to me is a very good thing because I am new to wet shaving.  I wanted to try different blades before settling on just one Pacific brand. I would recommend this to anyone looking for variety and  value for their money.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome way to find out which blades are good for you, and which ones butcher your face!</li>
    <li> Would have given this 5 stars if there were 16 different blades but there are 2 Bluebird Hi-Stainless. I would have preferred a Hi-Stainless to compare with a Hi-Stainless Platinum but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that a realy good selection. I really like comparing the different Trig/Treet, Nacets and Astras - gives a good idea about one manufacturer and the different products they make (thus - the comment on the Bluebird). Each blade so far other than the Derby has lasted 5 good shaves - great idea for determining which are best for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome way to try different blades to determine best blade for your shaving needs!</li>
    <li> This sampler pack is a good way for you to decide which blade is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I used it and rated the different blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products used: Parker 99R long Handel super heavy weight, Proraso pre shave,Taylor of old Bond street, Tweeserman brush, Old Spice after shave.&lt;br /&gt;I used a one to 10 rating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade make  Shave 1  Shave 2  Shave 3&lt;br /&gt;Astra  9  9  9&lt;br /&gt;Blue Bird  6  6  6&lt;br /&gt;Shark  3  3  2&lt;br /&gt;Bic  4  3&lt;br /&gt;Derby  5  5&lt;br /&gt;Treet  8  8 1/2  8 1/2&lt;br /&gt;Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock  8  8  8&lt;br /&gt;Trig  6  6  5&lt;br /&gt;Feather  9 1/2  9 1/2  9&lt;br /&gt;Super Max Stainless  4&lt;br /&gt;Super Max Platinum  6  5&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Nacet  8&lt;br /&gt;The above is just what I experienced. There are so many variables. Always remember... Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;From the above and on comfort and consistence My choice was Astra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Sedan</li>
    <li> When I purchased a safety razor for my husband (I got him the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor with Guard http://www.amazon.com/Merkur-Long-Handled-Safety-Razor/dp/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1425914159&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;safety+razor), I had no idea which blades to get for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read tons of stories where people loved a particular blade, while others said the same blade didn&#x27;t work for them at all. It seems highly personal as to which blades are best for a particular individual. The only solution that made sense was to get a variety pack so he could try several and buy a larger pack of his favorite. We are both so happy that I went this route. There were several he didn&#x27;t like at all. Some were okay. There were 3 that he particularly liked and we purchased a 100 pack of the cheapest of the 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a worthwhile way to choose your favorite blade.</li>
    <li> If you are new to the safety razor scene, and aren&#x27;t sure what blade to use, this is for you. It&#x27;s fun experimenting with the different options. Great learning experience.</li>
    <li> This is just what you need when you first start out using a DE. This will give you a good example how sharp a blade can be, along with how much of an angel they will bend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, from my experience they are all different. Some cut easier (feather) than others due to the sharpness, while some last more days as well due to material and design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are all decent blades (well so far, I can&#x27;t complain), but tt really depends on which one fits you best because everyone has a different style of shaving. Different angle, different DE shaver base, different swiping action, different shaving cream, etc. With this kind of variety you are bound to find something that fits you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Variety&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t have a decent blade holder the the package (just a plastic bag to hold them all), so make sure not to drop them and store them somewhere safe. The edges can be nicked extremely easily. Hopefully yours was packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great service thanks to the vender. Can&#x27;t beat it for the convenience of trying them all.</li>
    <li> This was a great way to check out a wide variety of blades. It was a very &amp;#34;international&#x27; experience! As a result of buying this variety pack of blades, I was able to try blades made in some really unexpected places (Pakistan, Turkey, Greece, and Russia, for example).Like a lot of guys, I got fed up paying the exorbitant prices for the multi-edge cartridge razor blades. So about a year ago I went back to using the same kind of double edge razor I originally learned how to shave on in the 1960&#x27;s. Since making that switch I&#x27;ve only used Personna blades. Since I had never tried anything else, I was not sure if they were the best ones for me or not. This variety pack allowed me to compare the Personna blades to a nice selection of other blades. As a result, I ended up finding a new brand that I liked a bit better than the Personna (the new one: Feather - made in Japan). Since everyone&#x27;s face and beard is different it&#x27;s hard to just go off of other&#x27;s reviews - what worked great on someone else&#x27;s face/beard may not work well for you. (In other words, just because I liked the Feather, and Personna, doesn&#x27;t mean you will). If you&#x27;re not sure the blade you&#x27;re currently using is &amp;#34;cutting it&amp;#34; for you (pun intended), I highly recommend trying this or some other variety pack. It&#x27;s the best way to experiment with different brands of blades from around the world!</li>
    <li> Perfect way to try out many razors before committing yourself to a 100 ct  box.  I&#x27;m currently using the Gillette Goal. It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;m trying. So far I&#x27;ve had 6 shaves with it. I haven&#x27;t had any nicks or cuts yet. I will continue using it until I feel it pulling or it does start to nic me. Shave 9 and it started pulling. Still didn&#x27;t cut. Tried the Astra. 2 shaves and it&#x27;s done. The first shave had some pulling, second shave and I started getting nicked. I tried the feather next 6 good shaves. I had some pulling from the get go bit no nicks. I shaved with 6 times before it started pulling too much I didn&#x27;t like it. But still no nicks. Gillette silver next....</li>
    <li> If you are new to DE shaving or are looking to find the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; blade for shaving, I highly recommend purchasing this sampler. I really enjoyed getting to try each blade and see how my face reacted to each one. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great starter pack to see which blade works for you.</li>
    <li> I am a beginner and don&#x27;t know much about blades, but everyone I&#x27;ve asked suggested a variety pack.  This has some of the most popular.  By trying out a few I realized how much of a difference there can be between two different blades.  I&#x27;ll be going with Feather from now on, and this pack saved me the time and money of going a different route.</li>
    <li> Worked great to find a blade I like and have purchased more of.</li>
    <li> This variety pack easily showed me the importance of trying different blades. Using the wrong blade for your face will almost be guaranteed to cause a lot of irritation.</li>
    <li> Found the blade that I liked from this package.  Helpful in making the decision.</li>
    <li> Feather, Astra, Gillette, and a few others. It was a pretty good variety, but some brands only had one blade, which makes it hard to be sure you have a good representative sample of the brand.</li>
    <li> These are extremely overpriced for what you actually get. I ordered a different set from another website for a reasonable amount.</li>
    <li> Paying a premium for the convenience is worth it if you&#x27;re new to shaving with a safety razor. I was skeptical, but there&#x27;s definitely a noticeable difference between each blade. Certain blades, I assume the sharper ones, will give me a bunch of tiny nicks on my neck, while other blades are nick-free. I&#x27;m glad I bought this pack because the most popular brands I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon such as Astra, Derby, and Feather are turning out to be the worst shave for me. The &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; blade is not the same for everyone though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it came with 2 of each blade as it&#x27;s difficult to judge when you&#x27;re also still getting the hang of the razor.</li>
    <li> Great sample pack for getting started!</li>
    <li> The only way to shave to find a razor that is right for your face.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I would rather have had a few more of the sharper varieties of blades.</li>
    <li> A good sample pack for those new to wet shaving. As others have recommended, try one of these sample packs when you buy your first double-edged razor. Then buy a small pack of your favorite blades to make sure, then go ahead with a 100 pack when you&#x27;re sure. Your face will thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a good selection of blades to try you can find your favorite combination of razor and blades this is sometimes difficult to do and this pack has made it a lot easier for me thank you</li>
    <li> Recommend this if you&#x27;re new to shaving with a double edge safety razor or if you&#x27;re looking to find the best blade for you skin.</li>
    <li> Perhaps there was a little confusion for the packager... The product header has \\&quot;16... Blade Sampler,\\&quot; the product features section states \\&quot;15 Different Blades. 16 Loose Blades (1 each),\\&quot; and the product description section reads \\&quot;15 of the best Continental Blades... 16 BLADES TOTAL.\\&quot; I received 15 blades. From reviewing the description, I received one Blue Bird blade instead of two. I haven&#x27;t used any of the blades yet, but this sampler has several that I want to try, namely Feather, Derby, Blue Bird, and Astra. Because everyone&#x27;s beard and face are unique, a blade that is great for one person may be terrible for another. Customer Waleed&#x27;s image has a \\&quot;Gillete 7 O&#x27;Clock Super Platinum\\&quot; and \\&quot;Gillete 7 O&#x27;Clock Super Stainless\\&quot; - I received two \\&quot;Gillete 7 O&#x27;Clock Super Stainless,\\&quot; which is per the description. Though I am short one Blue Bird blade, I am happy with the purchase. See my image with the little plastic bag.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re new to shaving with a Double Edge Safety Razor, this is a great sample pack. Lots of good blades in here like Feather, Astra and Gilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find what works best for you. If you can take type up bullet points after each shave with a blade.</li>
    <li> Good to figure out what razor you like.</li>
    <li> I was always skeptical about buying a double edged razor for the fact that the blades are interchangeable with the handle and I wasn&#x27;t sure about which one was right for my face.  After purchasing this trial kit, I was sure that I could purchase a good bulk of the same razor and I did.  This trial kit gives you a very wide range of razors from different manufacturers at a reasonable cost.  A must if you are new to DE shaving.</li>
    <li> This is a great sample pack. They have both Astra greens and Feather, as well as some others. There are enough to get a feel for how the different razors are, without having so many it takes you months to decide which you&#x27;ll go with.</li>
    <li> This is a good set for safety razor noobs, who are just learning or relearning how to shave with a safety razor. I recommend this set if you want to try a variety of blades before committing to a 50 or 100-pack of anything.  I wanted to try the Feather, Astra, and Derby, and they are all here, plus some lesser known brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit pricey for what you get, almost a dollar a blade, but I figure it will save money in the long run once I settle on a favorite one or two.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful way to try out a lot of different blades and a couple of types (metal vs. platinum) of blades to determine which one(s), one would prefer.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re trying to see if safety razor shaving is for you, get a product like this before you get too far down the road.  Despite different reviews on here recommending one blade over another, you should disregard those recommendations.  Everyone&#x27;s face is unique.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is unique.  So what one person recommends for their hairy rough face might be perfect.  But your smooth baby face gets torn up by the same blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of this product is to let you the consumer decide which blade is best for you.  At that job, this product is great.  Make sure you take notes on each blade so after you&#x27;ve gone through the set you can narrow down which blades were best.  Then go back and buy a small package of each of those top blades and test them against each other again.  The point of this product isn&#x27;t to identify which is the best blade for everyone out there.  It&#x27;s to help YOU figure out which blade is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#x27;ve identified your top performers test those blades again.  Don&#x27;t go out and buy 100 blades of one type based on this sample pack.  Try your top 3 again over a longer span before you commit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: buy the sample set to help you find the best blade for you.  Don&#x27;t buy into specific brand recommendations until you&#x27;ve tried a sample pack.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as advertised,  you get a wide assortment of blades. The quality of the blades varies sharply. For someone with a thick, fast growing beard,  some of the lower quality blades are just not up to the task.</li>
