      <li>I should have looked at the pictures better.  </li>
      <li>My mother likes them  , and  I’m glad I found it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>

      <li>Cute tiny brushes.  </li>
      <li>and they do exactly what they are suppose to do</li>
      <li>and I also like how you do not have to buy the whole pedicure set to get these!</li>
      <li>But they&#x27;re cute and I will definitely use them.</li>
      <li>Very nice little brushes for the price!!  </li>
      <li>bought these for our 5 year old granddaughter so she could keep her nails clean as she loves to play in the dirt</li>
      <li>Cheap stuff very soft bristles and cheap fragile plastic</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a good, but small nail brush, this could be the one you are looking for.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t mind much.</li>
      <li>They are also made from that very brittle type of plastic.</li>
      <li>I wish they have more than the pink colored ones.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>They work even better if you have the hands of a seven year old, these things are tiny.</li>
      <li>They seem decent enough, just your cheap run-of-the-mill nail brush.</li>
      <li>be advised these are super super super small.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and came early.</li>
      <li>Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
      <li>These nail brushes are true to the picture and they are exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>Really too small for most people to use.  </li>
      <li>so I recieved these 2 pink nail brushes super fast.</li>
      <li>The old saying:&amp;#34;you only get what you pay for&amp;#34; is right.</li>
      <li>and since they are insanely cheap, they were exactly as expected: small, kinda flimsy plastic, yet they do a fine job of cleaning your nails.</li>
      <li>Great little fingernail brushes that are hard to find in stores -</li>
      <li>Love that I can get this brush online - hard ot find in stores as they want to sell fancier ones.</li>
      <li>Just like my old one.</li>

<li> Love that I can get this brush online - hard ot find in stores as they want to sell fancier ones.</li>
<li> Just like my old one.</li>
<li> These brushes are only 2 inches long.  </li>
<li> There is no size given in the listing, but for some reason I expected the larger ones, like maybe 3 inches.  </li>
<li> but they came way smaller than I expected.</li>
<li> Got these earlier than expected.</li>
<li> Oh, they both broke in half after only two weeks.</li>
<li> Not too hard, not too soft.</li>
<li> When I found these in pink</li>
<li> These showed up quicker than expected.</li>
<li> Just what I expected.</li>
<li> They took a long time to arrive (delivered form China) and not worth returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.</li>
<li> You will have to be careful not to snap these when using.  </li>
<li> I would rather have received one larger one than 2 this small.</li>
<li> other then</li>
<li> Big waste!</li>
<li> This product is small enough to take with you in your purse.  </li>
<li> not worth the money or frustration</li>
<li> Less than 1 week of ordering.</li>
<li> They might take a little longer to arrive since they are coming from overseas</li>
<li> fits my cosmetic supply... pink!!!</li>
<li> Ordering these brushes was a waste of time and effort.  </li>
<li> and she was having trouble cleaning under her nails.</li>
<li> They are really small, its like they are for little kids.</li>
<li> I like that it is small</li>
<li> They were a bit small...</li>
<li> They are small</li>
<li> small and sturdy.</li>
<li> They are uncomfortably small.  </li>
<li> I mean like sized for a child.</li>
<li> Not good quality the bristles come out and are very small....</li>
<li> They are the worst brushes ever.</li>

    <li> be advised these are super super super small. I mean like sized for a child.</li>
    <li> They say it&#x27;s 2 nail brushs, but you only get one.</li>
    <li> Cute tiny brushes.  Its smaller than the ones you see at the nail salon.  It is this size I was looking for.  I wish they have more than the pink colored ones.</li>
    <li> They were a bit small...I must have not read the description.  Would have liked them bigger.</li>
    <li> They are really small, its like they are for little kids. other then that, they are fine I only ordered them for home use so I don&#x27;t mind much.</li>

    <li> Great little fingernail brushes that are hard to find in stores - and they do exactly what they are suppose to do: get your fingernails clean! They might take a little longer to arrive since they are coming from overseas but, hey! look at that price. Totally worth the wait.</li>
    <li> small and sturdy. works great. im very happy with them</li>
    <li> I like them but they came way smaller than I expected. But they&#x27;re cute and I will definitely use them.</li>
    <li> Why did I buy these? They are the worst brushes ever. The old saying:&amp;#34;you only get what you pay for&amp;#34; is right. Ordering these brushes was a waste of time and effort.  Don&#x27;t buy them. Oh, they both broke in half after only two weeks. Big waste!</li>
    <li> Teeny, tiny, Barbie sized nail brush.  I would not buy again.  Quality okay, just not practical to hold.</li>
    <li> Not good quality the bristles come out and are very small....</li>
    <li> This product is small enough to take with you in your purse.  I have one at work also and I love it.</li>

    <li> fits my cosmetic supply... pink!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered from beauticom. They are located in the US so I recieved these 2 pink nail brushes super fast. Less than 1 week of ordering. These nail brushes are true to the picture and they are exactly what I expected. They are great for getting the dirt under your nails. They are small so I ordered them so my sister and I could both have one in our travel kits. You can&#x27;t beat this price and I also like how you do not have to buy the whole pedicure set to get these! Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> They do the job, so good value. Good service. Thanks.</li>
    <li> bought these for our 5 year old granddaughter so she could keep her nails clean as she loves to play in the dirt and she was having trouble cleaning under her nails. When I found these in pink I knew they were perfect for her! She loves it, keeps one at our house and one at home so she can keep her nails nice and clean all the time.</li>
    <li> Got these earlier than expected. I tried them out, works great. removes a lot of the dust when filing. I like that I have 2 of them. happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> great product, happy and clean cuticles</li>
    <li> Easy to hold :)they clean the dust very well and seems to be made with good materials :) So I recommend the product and the price and shipping cost was ok :)</li>
    <li> Works great. I was looking for something inexpensive, this fit the bill. Works well with a bit of soap to clean nails.</li>

    <li> DON\\&quot;T BUY.  These are smaller than I imagined.  Really too small for most people to use.  They are also made from that very brittle type of plastic. You will have to be careful not to snap these when using.  They took a long time to arrive (delivered form China) and not worth returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. Ha they both broke.</li>
    <li> ...and since they are insanely cheap, they were exactly as expected: small, kinda flimsy plastic, yet they do a fine job of cleaning your nails. :)</li>
    <li> Very nice little brushes for the price!!  Glad I bought more than one set  :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and came early. Great price!</li>
    <li> This brush is very easy to use and works as what it is described.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails and I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of using a brush on them after I&#x27;ve cut and filed them to get all the excess off (and to see what I missed). These work great for just that.</li>
    <li> Cheap stuff very soft bristles and cheap fragile plastic not worth the money or frustration</li>
    <li> satisfied with the purchase, really like</li>
    <li> Works how I want it to, good price.</li>
    <li> PERFECT SIZE FOR EVERYONE..EVEN KIDS...AND YOU GET TWO.THEY DO A GREAT JOB AND ARE PRETTY...&lt;br /&gt;BY A SECOND SET TO GIVE TO OTHERS...CAN NOT BEAT THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> They scrub my finger nails well</li>
    <li> It took awhile to get them but they are just as described.  You get two in the package and both have sturdy bristles.  Honestly  , I looked all over but  and could not find anything similar to this nail brush here in town.  My mother likes them  , and  I’m glad I found it here on Amazon.</li>
