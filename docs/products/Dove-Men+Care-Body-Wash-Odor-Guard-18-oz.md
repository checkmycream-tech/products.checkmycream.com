      <li>&amp;#34;I received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>LIKES HAVING HIS OWN STUFF AND NOT SHARING THE DIAL BODYWASH WITH HIS SISTERS.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a Dove product, so it&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>nice but strong smell</li>
      <li>Came quick and in good shape.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a bit more &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; - probably because I just switched from Axe -</li>
      <li>Favorite body wash.</li>
      <li>My oldest son&#x27;s favorite body wash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d go 5 Stars if it had more &amp;#34;Dove-like&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The smell is excellent and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Very effective, particularly for the price.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and clean and it rinses easily.</li>
      <li>Leaves you smelling good and leaves that fresh clean feeling.</li>
      <li>It is nice to be able to try higher priced items at a discounted price.</li>
      <li>But it does what it advertises, effective way to control odor and leaves your skin feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I got it because recently my husband had tried it and loved it!</li>
      <li>Husband had Never used this before but when it became available for such an INCREDIBLE price....</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best body wash I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Smells great and does last.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice, but really dries the skin every time I use it.</li>
      <li>So far so good I will be ordering this again</li>
      <li>Nice smell, does not dry out your skin, rinses easily.</li>
      <li>works as expected and great price.</li>
      <li>Good for the big boys.</li>
      <li>Wash lathers well and rinses off easily, strong almost overbearing smell with a likeness to an incredibly manly cologne which if you&#x27;re ensitive enough can lead to massive migraines.</li>
      <li>Worth the buy.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this stuff, always leaves me feeling clean and smelling like a million bucks (not actually... thankfully).</li>
      <li>I love dove products in general.</li>
      <li>I like it, the smell is a bit strong, but that&#x27;s the point of the odor guard, minus one star for a powerful, axe-like smell that lingers and it stings the eye a bit, but it does leave me feeling clean and at elast I don&#x27;t smell like B.O.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the manly musky smell at first, but it grows on you.</li>
      <li>Just need to get my brother to stop using it ;)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received much positive feedback on the scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for dry skin, however does nothing for body odor, my dad still smell like a garbage dump.</li>
      <li>dOVE IS VERY SCENTILATING</li>
      <li>works as expected now sbscribed for even better pricing.</li>
      <li>My husband is very picky when it comes to scents/smells.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a girl and very athletic</li>
      <li>but I really like it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a &#x27;luxurious&#x27; lather which rinses clean and easy, leaves my normally rough, dry sun-exposed skin much smoother and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I highly recomend.</li>
      <li>I have used it for a while  Highly recommended</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pleasant smell, subtle, but effective.</li>
      <li>Sometimes you don&#x27;t even have to wear deodorant with this body wash because that&#x27;s how strong and long lasting it is.</li>
      <li>However, he likes the way it cleans and keeps him smelling fresh all day long.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin towards dyes and perfumes and this gives me no problems</li>
      <li>While I really like the scent of this body wash, I&#x27;m not the one that has to use it regularly.</li>
      <li>four year old says I smell good!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

    <li> So far so good I will be ordering this again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a couple bottles of this body wash (I don&#x27;t use it as a dedicated face wash, although the package indicates one could) and have been happy with it. The scent is nice and clean and it rinses easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely pricey in my opinion but I think it works well and in dry Colorado keeps your skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant smell, subtle, but effective. I&#x27;ve received much positive feedback on the scent.</li>
    <li> Does not cause excessive drying out and the smell lasts all day.</li>

    <li> Favorite body wash. I didn&#x27;t like the manly musky smell at first, but it grows on you. Also works as a good face cleanser.</li>
    <li> Smells so good, and lasts all day! I&#x27;m a girl and very athletic so I get the strongest stuff. Sometimes you don&#x27;t even have to wear deodorant with this body wash because that&#x27;s how strong and long lasting it is. It&#x27;s also a Dove product, so it&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin. I love it! Just need to get my brother to stop using it ;)</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and he smells nice. That&#x27;s about it!</li>

    <li> Absolutely wonderful product. I have always loved Dove, this smells amazing. I would recommend this to friends and family</li>
    <li> All I ever use, great product</li>
    <li> Wash lathers well and rinses off easily, strong almost overbearing smell with a likeness to an incredibly manly cologne which if you&#x27;re ensitive enough can lead to massive migraines. But it does what it advertises, effective way to control odor and leaves your skin feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and really removes Odor and keeps Odor away! Worth the buy.</li>
