      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>They are a perfect fit for my hair and barely show in my hair.</li>
      <li>I use clips in my hair a lot and these are very strong and fit head and hair well.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good size, so if your hair is regular/average thickness, it should  hold it pulled into a pony.  </li>
      <li>Has a strong grip on hair, so you don&#x27;t have to fix it every 5 minutes, and the foam also causes no damage and is comfortable!  </li>
      <li>This clip has been my favorite clip because it is strong and can hold up my hair for hours.  </li>
      <li>Just a perfect size, I just bought more the other day.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have a mirror to help, they&#x27;re easy to secure again.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait for summer, and days at beach or pool, being worry free about my hair.....</li>

      <li>These were perfect for thin, fine hair!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always on the look out for a good hair clip that can hold my long, fine hair in place.</li>
      <li>The clips were reasonable and came quickly but are very Cheaply made.</li>
      <li>These clips are great because the foam glued inside keeps my clip from slipping out.  </li>
      <li>Great basic clip and clip holds real well.  </li>
      <li>Being an add-on item is a real pain for me!!  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine, not thick.  </li>
      <li>Great little clips hold my hair without pulling!</li>
      <li>I have very fine blonde hair and this clip does stay in my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair looked nice all day long!</li>
      <li>Unless you don&#x27;t have a Walmart or a dollars store that&#x27;s the only reason purchase these for more than a dollar.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Buy now, when I love a product, they usually stop making it.  :-)</li>
      <li>The products look and are exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>Im always struggling to find good quality clips that will hold my hair tight, but looks like I&#x27;ve found them!</li>
      <li>The price was fine for the 2 clips in good basic black and tortoise shell colors.</li>
      <li>These are perfect, due to the memory foam that holds the hair tightly in the clip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Usually my fine hair slips out of most claw hair clips and I have to constantly reclip my hair back up.</li>
      <li>Other clips have been a little too large for my hair, but these do a great job!</li>
      <li>My hair is shoulder length, blonde, straight, medium to fine texture, medium thickness.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really hard for me to find a clip that stays put and has a good grip.  </li>
      <li>Great for hair to wear everyday and keep the hair up in back.  </li>
      <li>Almost everything I picked didn&#x27;t count to go with the add-on, really had a heck of a time.  </li>
      <li>I would load up my cart with items I wasn&#x27;t planning on buying at that time, but I really wanted these foam jaw clips.  </li>
      <li>They hold my thinning hair far better than the just plastic ones, the foam definitely makes the difference.  </li>
      <li>Maybe not big enough for really thick hair, but great for thinner fine hair.</li>
      <li>They are tiny and flimsy and certainly will not hold any hair that is not extra fine.</li>
      <li>The other two were fine</li>
      <li>you need something for a quick hair pickup for a few times these work great; otherwise, too weak.</li>
      <li>They are great clips, but a little hard to open.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The little memory foam pieces work nicely to prevent my hair from slipping out of the clip.</li>
      <li>ingenious solution of simply putting a little grippy, rubber-like pad inside the clip allows me to use something a little bigger to give my hair the appearance of more volume.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I received my clips.</li>
      <li>Clips are always breaking on my hair but these are working out well, so far.</li>
      <li>If anything, they&#x27;re a little small, but that just gives it a good hold on my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rate them a 5 but the clip is difficult to open: while the small area to grasp makes the clip look nice, it makes it hard to grasp especially as it is a strong clip.</li>
      <li>Finally, strong clips for my thick hair.</li>
      <li>Not as big as some other clips, but definitely worth the price.  </li>
      <li>My hair is a little bit below shoulder length and they are the right size.</li>
      <li>The Spring isn&#x27;t as Strong when Fully Open as You&#x27;d Like with Thick Hair.  </li>

    <li> The clip is wound very tight.  I have a hard time opening it without it popping out of my fingers.  Being an add-on item is a real pain for me!!  I would load up my cart with items I wasn&#x27;t planning on buying at that time, but I really wanted these foam jaw clips.  I don&#x27;t have it figured out what type/category of product to add that will work for the add-on item to be purchased.  Almost everything I picked didn&#x27;t count to go with the add-on, really had a heck of a time.  I have very fine blonde hair and this clip does stay in my hair.</li>
    <li> Unless you don&#x27;t have a Walmart or a dollars store that&#x27;s the only reason purchase these for more than a dollar.  They are tiny and flimsy and certainly will not hold any hair that is not extra fine. I was very disappointed and returned them immediately for a refund.  Walked into Walmart and found better bargain.</li>
    <li> The memory foam works great to keep the clip from working loose in my fine hair.  Great idea, great service.</li>
    <li> The are really hard to open.  My hair is a little bit below shoulder length and they are the right size.</li>
    <li> I have long thin, fine, slippery hair that is a challenge because clips and such are forever slipping out.  I don&#x27;t like to use smaller clips because the minuscule size that I need tends to emphasize the lack of volume and make my hair look bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ingenious solution of simply putting a little grippy, rubber-like pad inside the clip allows me to use something a little bigger to give my hair the appearance of more volume.  I used it yesterday for the first time and was pleased that at the end of the day it hadn&#x27;t budged.  My hair looked nice all day long!</li>
    <li> Usually when I get hair clips they are either too small or too large. These are perfect, due to the memory foam that holds the hair tightly in the clip.&lt;br /&gt;I know I can count on these to stay in during a workout, and that&#x27;s invaluable to me!</li>
    <li> This is my first time ordering such a small item from Amazon. I was pleasantly surprised when I received my clips. They came faster than I expected. Even though these clips look very similar to the one I usually get from Target, the quality is on a whole different level!! Im always struggling to find good quality clips that will hold my hair tight, but looks like I&#x27;ve found them!</li>
    <li> This was a good pick. They are great clips, but a little hard to open.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them though</li>
    <li> These are my favorite hair clips! I&#x27;ve transitioned to using clips instead of a pony tail, because my hair stylist said that my hair had a lot of breaking from the rubber band (even though it is coated in cloth/thread). I&#x27;ve tried several hair clips. I have fine/medium hair, definitely not thick hair, that goes past my shoulders. Other clips have been a little too large for my hair, but these do a great job! If anything, they&#x27;re a little small, but that just gives it a good hold on my hair.</li>
    <li> Great basic clip and clip holds real well.  I use clips in my hair a lot and these are very strong and fit head and hair well.  Maybe not big enough for really thick hair, but great for thinner fine hair.</li>
    <li> I buy these four at a time and I always end of losing them. I have long, thick hair. These jaw clips stay put.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my hair.  They also haven&#x27;t lost any of their springyness even though I play with them all the time.  I like them.</li>
    <li> It is often difficult for me to find a clip that holds my long, thick hair in place.  With this clip, I put my hair up and forget it is there.  No clip or hair falling out as I move about my day.  The jaws do not damage my hair, either.  I&#x27;m really happy with these clips!</li>
    <li> Finally, strong clips for my thick hair. Clips are always breaking on my hair but these are working out well, so far. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Man I wish I could still find these! These were perfect for thin, fine hair!</li>
    <li> The products look and are exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;They actually work as described and work wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;My two star rating is because they are flimsy and weak plastic.&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses the tines break off.  So sad.  So bad.&lt;br /&gt;If you need something for a quick hair pickup for a few times these work great; otherwise, too weak.</li>
    <li> I have thick asian hair and it&#x27;s really hard for me to find a clip that stays put and has a good grip.  This clip has been my favorite clip because it is strong and can hold up my hair for hours.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Regular size clips are too big for my long, thin hair (unless it is curled), so I thought I&#x27;d try these tiny little things.  They are a perfect fit for my hair and barely show in my hair. Just a perfect size, I just bought more the other day.</li>
    <li> The clips were reasonable and came quickly but are very Cheaply made. I went to use it and it Broke upon my second use.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They hold my thinning hair far better than the just plastic ones, the foam definitely makes the difference.  Buy now, when I love a product, they usually stop making it.  :-)</li>
    <li> These clips are amazing for staying put all day.  They&#x27;re very comfortable and easy to use.  My only complaint is that they look rather dated.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m always on the look out for a good hair clip that can hold my long, fine hair in place. I&#x27;m so glad I found these! I like the claw style hair clips but I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding ones that work for my type of hair. Usually my fine hair slips out of most claw hair clips and I have to constantly reclip my hair back up. The little memory foam pieces work nicely to prevent my hair from slipping out of the clip.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, not thick.  These clips are great because the foam glued inside keeps my clip from slipping out.  I love them.</li>
    <li> Great little clips hold my hair without pulling! My hair is shoulder length, blonde, straight, medium to fine texture, medium thickness. The memory foam holds this clip in place, rather than slide out.</li>
    <li> The price was fine for the 2 clips in good basic black and tortoise shell colors. I&#x27;d rate them a 5 but the clip is difficult to open: while the small area to grasp makes the clip look nice, it makes it hard to grasp especially as it is a strong clip. Also: the design with missing central &#x27;tooth&#x27; allows hairs to stick out a bit and look messy.</li>
    <li> Why did it take so long for someone to figure this out?!  It&#x27;s been right there staring us in the face all this time,and it&#x27;s absolutely PERFECT!  Has a strong grip on hair, so you don&#x27;t have to fix it every 5 minutes, and the foam also causes no damage and is comfortable!  It&#x27;s pretty good size, so if your hair is regular/average thickness, it should  hold it pulled into a pony.  My hair is very thick....like 3 heads of hair....so, just one won&#x27;t hold it all.  I did find a way to make the cutest crisscross pony, using 2 of them,and once it&#x27;s done, I don&#x27;t have to bother with my hair all day!  I have gotten so many compliments about my sturdy cute pony and the rounded shape of these clips, they deffinitely need more colors.  When people find out that they have memory foam,  they all have the same thought as I did.....how could this not have been thought of sooner, when it was in front of us for years!  I can&#x27;t wait for summer, and days at beach or pool, being worry free about my hair.....</li>
    <li> One was defective with one side completely missing and could not be opened so was useless.  The other two were fine</li>
    <li> These are very comfortable to wear.  Not as big as some other clips, but definitely worth the price.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> Works Ok.  The Spring isn&#x27;t as Strong when Fully Open as You&#x27;d Like with Thick Hair.  Would Work Best with Finer Hair.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, curly hair, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of clips to keep it all under control. These work really well when I want to just wrap my hair in a bun and secure it at the base of my neck. They do the job and they hold all day. They&#x27;re also not fussy, so if I do need to re-do and I don&#x27;t have a mirror to help, they&#x27;re easy to secure again. I bought another pair just in case, but they&#x27;ve lasted well!</li>
