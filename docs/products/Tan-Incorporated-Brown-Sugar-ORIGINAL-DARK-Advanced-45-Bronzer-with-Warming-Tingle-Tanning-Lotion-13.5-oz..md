      <li>the right amount of tingle!!</li>
      <li>The smell is lovely and does not leave the skin w/ that cooked smell that all of us are familiar with..</li>
      <li>This left me beautifully bronzed after one use so now</li>
      <li>I noticed no after tan oder which is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>Smell is important to me.</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent and is very moisterizing.</li>
      <li>I am an experienced tanner and have tried serval different lotions but not a &amp;#34;tingler&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;A light tingle&amp;#34; my A</li>
      <li>It gradually gets more and more intense as your tanning session goes, and the first 2 times I used it</li>
      <li>but it definitely helped me get a good tan going</li>
      <li>Not bad for price mild tingle</li>

      <li>I really like the lotion.</li>
      <li>This stuff worked great, did have a small odor to it when you first open the bottle</li>

      <li>Older lotions can lose effectiveness and/or change color/odor.</li>
      <li>I wish it had a little bit more of a tingle to it</li>
      <li>But it makes me too red to feel comfortable in public after tanning.</li>
      <li>i can tan in the salon without feeling guilty for all the money i spent on lotions , b/c amazing amazon offers me the tanning lotions i love and at a fraction of saloon prices.</li>
      <li>It smells good &amp; produces dark results in just a few uses.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s to basic for a person who is  Pro tanner, and to much for a person who is new tanner.</li>
      <li>Also it gives a slight warming sensation not like other lotions where it gets too warm feels like it is burning into my skin.</li>
      <li>Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but when I tried this lotion the &#x27;tingle&#x27; that you&#x27;re supposed to feel felt like a RAGING sunburn after 10 minutes on a low-intensity tanning bed, and I looked like a boiled lobster for a solid 3 hours afterward.</li>
      <li>Kinda thick, goes on kinda white, packaging looks cheap, and bottle is kinda flimsy.</li>

<li> Kinda thick, goes on kinda white, packaging looks cheap, and bottle is kinda flimsy.</li>
<li> Got me fairly dark after a month of using it in a level 1-3 bed for 8-15 minutes daily.</li>
<li> But its a little thick and if you dont get it on evenly it will leave you very splotchy.</li>
<li> Not intense at all; product left me a little pink but this went away, I am hoping this breaks the tanning plateau.</li>
<li> I noticed getting a shade darker too, only complaint is that it left me with some spots that were splotchy.</li>
<li> My skin was blotchey red, totally uneven and</li>
<li> tingle is not hot, just warming.</li>
<li> I recommend this lotion for those that want a dark tan.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not to dark an</li>
<li> so it makes tanning a little painful at first when you start out as white as I am</li>
<li> Waste of $14 bucks as the bottle is headed for the trash.</li>
<li> but it says 45X which is not overwhelming.</li>
<li> I added a little water to thin it out so it will spread easier.</li>
<li> I used this fall 2013 to Spring 2014, it is rather outdated as of now (04/09/2015)</li>
<li> That was kinda weird.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m shocked to see that it works well for others</li>
<li> I purchased this lotion to use while getting my base tan</li>
<li> You must have a base tan to use this or else</li>

    <li> This is my first tingle lotion I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve been tanning for around 6 months.  This lotion is fabulous!  It gradually gets more and more intense as your tanning session goes, and the first 2 times I used it the tingle was extremely intense, but now I&#x27;ve gotten really used to it.  It smells great, has gotten me plenty darker, and this is a great lotion for seasoned tanners or beginners trying their first tingle.</li>
    <li> over all i like the lotion. It has a nice scent and is very moisterizing. But its a little thick and if you dont get it on evenly it will leave you very splotchy. I added a little water to thin it out so it will spread easier. I noticed no after tan oder which is a huge plus. But it makes me too red to feel comfortable in public after tanning.</li>
    <li> Not bad for price mild tingle</li>
    <li> I really like the lotion. I wish it had a little bit more of a tingle to it but it smells amazing and the shipping was incredibly fast!!</li>
    <li> This product works as well as any I have purchased from the tanning salon at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> It smells great! Great tan!!Just the right amount of tingle!! already purchase another bottle!My boyfriend says I can stop tanning.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;A light tingle&amp;#34; my A**! They should use this stuff on detained terrorists to extract information from them. Felt like my skin was on fire for more than an hour, even after a shower. I am an experienced tanner and have tried serval different lotions but not a &amp;#34;tingler&amp;#34;. My skin was blotchey red, totally uneven and I Iooked rediculous after using &amp;#34;brown sugar&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m shocked to see that it works well for others but glad it worked for you. Waste of $14 bucks as the bottle is headed for the trash.</li>
    <li> Tingle is not so intense, which is very good for me! I noticed getting a shade darker too, only complaint is that it left me with some spots that were splotchy. That was kinda weird.</li>
    <li> This is an okay lotion. I am an experienced tanner and love super HOT tingles and this just did not do it for me. It was a warm low tingle..... I think this is a great lotion for someone who wants to try out tingle. Also it does have bronzers, which is also a plus.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion, came with a sample of totally baked that I am most definitely ordering next time too. Fast Delivery &amp; great price. Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Tanned me very well, highly reccomend</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way this stuff smells. It&#x27;s tingle so it makes tanning a little painful at first when you start out as white as I am but it definitely helped me get a good tan going and I loved it. I plan on ordering more when I start tanning again!</li>

It&#x27;s to basic for a person who is  Pro tanner, and to much for a person who is new tanner. I would say this would be good for a person who is somewhere in the middle between pro and new. Overall its just ok</li>
    <li> Not intense at all; product left me a little pink but this went away, I am hoping this breaks the tanning plateau. Scent is pretty good, some ATO(after tanning odor) after but smells like I have sun lotion on. Could have a touch more bronzers but it says 45X which is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> i can tan in the salon without feeling guilty for all the money i spent on lotions , b/c amazing amazon offers me the tanning lotions i love and at a fraction of saloon prices.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but when I tried this lotion the &#x27;tingle&#x27; that you&#x27;re supposed to feel felt like a RAGING sunburn after 10 minutes on a low-intensity tanning bed, and I looked like a boiled lobster for a solid 3 hours afterward. Anyone with super-white or super-sensitive skin......beware.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it gets me Dark and I have tried all of snookie&#x27;s and pauly Ds and they make my hands orange but this one is great and it has a warming tingle that is great. I get a lot of compliments on my tan from strangers</li>
    <li> Smells great and tans pretty good.  I did not find that it was as hot as some reported but I am a veteran tanner.</li>
    <li> love it brought out my tan, no smelly after tan smell. tingle is not hot, just warming. love the results</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve yet to use. You must have a base tan to use this or else your a** will burn, its THAT intense and temporarily reddens/tingles the skin. This left me beautifully bronzed after one use so now I use it once a week mixed with another lotion (Australian Gold Bronzer). The smell is lovely and does not leave the skin w/ that cooked smell that all of us are familiar with.. The texture and consistency of this bronzing lotion is luscious and creamy. I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> It got here in the time it said. I just do not like the smell of it. That has nothing to do with the seller though.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a week and i have received a nice tan. I&#x27;m not to dark an it doesnt cause redness when i am done. Also it gives a slight warming sensation not like other lotions where it gets too warm feels like it is burning into my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked great, did have a small odor to it when you first open the bottle but once on your skin you couldn&#x27;t smell it. Was probably just the bottle itself. Got me fairly dark after a month of using it in a level 1-3 bed for 8-15 minutes daily. NOTE: I used this fall 2013 to Spring 2014, it is rather outdated as of now (04/09/2015) so I would recommend purchasing a more recent lotion! Older lotions can lose effectiveness and/or change color/odor.</li>
    <li> Accelerates tan, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love lotions that have good bronzers in them. I recommend this lotion for those that want a dark tan.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion to use while getting my base tan and it worked very well.  It smells good &amp; produces dark results in just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Smell is important to me. This has a pleasant odor. The evenness of tan is good. Nice level of darkness.</li>
