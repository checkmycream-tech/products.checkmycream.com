      <li>It has been a great product.</li>
      <li>The 5oz size tube makes this a great value too.  </li>

      <li>Great moisturizer but not for my face.</li>
      <li>Very effective for stretch marks.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product!</li>
      <li>All I can say is this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Its creamy consistency may be too much for oily skin, but it is perfect for mine.</li>
      <li>please give this a honest try and in about 3 months you will see notable difference.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in love with those products.</li>
      <li>This cream does more than moisturize.  </li>
      <li>However the skin of the affected area is much more supple.</li>
      <li>I bought 3 more :-)</li>
      <li>This stuff is phenomenal.</li>
      <li>this is an outstanding product.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t testify to seeing any results yet, but the product itself is very mild on the skin, spreads easily, lasts all day.</li>
      <li>This is a resilient cream which wont rub off easily.</li>
      <li>Great ingredients that make my skin feel soft and smooth</li>
      <li>I even use this on my face - the ingredients help to keep you skin smooth and</li>
      <li>as well - it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
      <li>After a full bottle Ive seen no results.</li>
      <li>I use the cream on my stomach and my skin is SO much softer and better looking since I&#x27;ve started using the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff must work good because my daughter who is 7 mos pregnant uses it religiously</li>
      <li>after long term use my complexion has no dark areas and the best part is my scaring is gone.</li>
      <li>i found this cream to be inexpensive and adequate, but too oily and sort of sticky.&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed with a clean after-feeling.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One quick note...</li>
      <li>It is perfect for my normal to dry skin and wears very well with my makeup and sunscreen.</li>
      <li>however it is way to strong for my sensitive face specially my eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, or super oily, and no weird smell.</li>
      <li>I bought the same product from a very popular Arkansas based big box retailer company for $17.99.  </li>
      <li>I want smoother skin first and foremost.</li>
      <li>Many quality ingredients in it though for daily use.</li>
      <li>My hip and abdomen stretch marks are virtually gone, as in no red marks, no white/silver train tracks, no ugly purple lines!!!</li>
      <li>I love this products after my surgery my scar  little light up thank you</li>
      <li>great for overall skin health; not really for stretch marks.</li>
      <li>So brand recognition and positive experience 2)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I think that if you have reasonable expectations for this product you will be amazed at the results.</li>
      <li>It heal the stretch marks so the skin was not thin, i will order again.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use for stretch marks, nothing really meets it&#x27;s claims for those.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing, non-greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.</li>
      <li>I got this product maybe a couple days after I purchased it, so I was very</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t thick or creamy, it doesn&#x27;t smell good, and it didn&#x27;t improve my skin.</li>
      <li>have rather realistic expectations.</li>
      <li>I have older (3+ years) stretch marks on my knees and thighs.</li>
      <li>Maybe this just doesn&#x27;t work on older marks.</li>
      <li>As compared to other stretch mark creams, this product sits nicely in the middle of the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I feel that they are becoming less noticeable.</li>
      <li>My face is very sensitive</li>
      <li>My first bottle - generously applied to hips, abdomen and upper thighs- lasted a month.</li>
      <li>when I was in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
      <li>have years&#x27; old stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Totally agree with the other reviews as the product does not make the marks disappear but does lighten them rather distinctly.  </li>
      <li>And I think with prolonged use, barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>This is a luxurious, thick, non greasy, truly fragrance free cream.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll put this little number on my affected areas, wear it all day and by the time I&#x27;m ready to have a bath, the cream is still very present.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i found this cream to be inexpensive and adequate, but too oily and sort of sticky.&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed with a clean after-feeling. a little icky, i ended up getting other creams. i will not buy this in the future.</li>
    <li> Worked the best in comparison to others</li>
    <li> This is a luxurious, thick, non greasy, truly fragrance free cream.  I don&#x27;t use it for stretch marks; I use it for my dry hands and feet.  This is an amazing product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a basic lotion. It isn&#x27;t thick or creamy, it doesn&#x27;t smell good, and it didn&#x27;t improve my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff must work good because my daughter who is 7 mos pregnant uses it religiously and she wouldn&#x27;t waste her time if it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer but not for my face. Great ingredients that make my skin feel soft and smooth however it is way to strong for my sensitive face specially my eyes. I got red and burning eyes at the end of the day. But still a very good body and hand moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It heal the stretch marks so the skin was not thin, i will order again.</li>
    <li> still just starting out so hopefully it gives me the results i am hoping for. I do see my stretch marks have lightened some.</li>
    <li> great for overall skin health; not really for stretch marks. Many quality ingredients in it though for daily use.</li>
    <li> This cream does more than moisturize.  I even use this on my face - the ingredients help to keep you skin smooth and supple.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase the Eye cream as well - it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this products after my surgery my scar  little light up thank you</li>
    <li> I have older (3+ years) stretch marks on my knees and thighs. Applied this once or twice a day for 4 weeks. No changes in the stretch marks. Maybe this just doesn&#x27;t work on older marks. I will keep trying, but I am not feeling optimistic</li>
    <li> Works well as facial cream for dry skin!</li>
    <li> What I am using this cream for:&lt;br /&gt;I have years&#x27; old stretch marks. I also have some slightly puckered skin. The locations are butt, tummy, and breasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have I tried any other stretch mark creams/oils/lotions before?&lt;br /&gt;No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are my expectations?&lt;br /&gt;I have rather realistic expectations. I want smoother skin first and foremost. I want the look of the marks to not be as noticeable. Overall I want to see a noticeable difference and improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made me decide on CeraVe considering all the other products out there?&lt;br /&gt;1) I use CeraVe moisturizing cream for my children&#x27;s eczema. It has been a great product. So brand recognition and positive experience 2) The price. I purchased this at Walgreens for $20. As compared to other stretch mark creams, this product sits nicely in the middle of the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How am I using this product?&lt;br /&gt;I am applying liberally to problem areas once a day after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;After one week I can say that my skin is softer. But the stretch marks seem the same. However the skin of the affected area is much more supple. I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two weeks that I&#x27;ve used this product and I have noticed an improvement. The skin around the stretch marks is soft and the marks themselves have become fainter, less pronounced. I will definitely continue use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Three weeks into using. My stomach and butt are vastly improved. Everything is smoother and softer. The stretch marks are definitely not as noticeable. My husband has even commented on the improvement. Also, I have been using daily on three problem areas and still have product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think that if you have reasonable expectations for this product you will be amazed at the results. This cream will not eliminate stretch marks, rather it makes them softer and fainter. And I think with prolonged use, barely noticeable. I plan to continue to use.te again after a couple months.</li>
    <li> It takes along time but it works if you buy you might wanna buy 2-4 use everyday don&#x27;t forget</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using CeraVe cream for approximately two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t remove your stretch marks but what it will do is make your skin firmer which reduces the appearance of stretch marks.  I use the cream on my stomach and my skin is SO much softer and better looking since I&#x27;ve started using the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this cream for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> Just got it tried it just today my skin is just soaking it in seems to be a wonderful product wish me luck</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, non-greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t stain clothing. I applied it morning &amp; night on my belly throughout my pregnancy &amp; did not experience any itching or dryness.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Seriously I still can&#x27;t believe the difference this made in just a month! this lotion is now a twice daily part of my routine. I&#x27;ve told several friends it is a must buy for your post baby body! My hip and abdomen stretch marks are virtually gone, as in no red marks, no white/silver train tracks, no ugly purple lines!!! I still can&#x27;t believe it. My first bottle - generously applied to hips, abdomen and upper thighs- lasted a month. Do yourself a favor and buy this lotion, tons cheaper than whatever laser treatments are out there. Buy it now, just do it! Add to cart.</li>
    <li> My face is very sensitive so I can not use products with fragrance or some of the oils they put in them. it really makes me sad about all the money I used to spend on skin care products when Cerave was right in front of me. ladies believe me this is the best product I have ever used. after long term use my complexion has no dark areas and the best part is my scaring is gone. when I was in my early 20&#x27;s I had acne so bad that it left huge deep scaring around my mouth and cheeks I was so ashamed of them that I would not go to the mail box without my makeup believe me when I say it took me 2 minutes to reach it I mean it.  please give this a honest try and in about 3 months you will see notable difference.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is phenomenal. I don&#x27;t use for stretch marks, nothing really meets it&#x27;s claims for those. Not sure why they marketed this cream for stretch marks.  As a face and body cream for dryer skin this is an outstanding product.  The ceremides, hyaluronic acid and niacinamide are excellent ingredients for the face and body.  The 5oz size tube makes this a great value too.  It is perfect for my normal to dry skin and wears very well with my makeup and sunscreen. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for oily skin though.  Its creamy consistency may be too much for oily skin, but it is perfect for mine. I hope Cereve never discontinues this...it is great.</li>
    <li> I got a lot of stretch marks during my pregnancy, especially on the tops of my upper thighs and I didn&#x27;t wanna spend a ton of money on a stretch mark cream when I&#x27;ve heard they don&#x27;t work, so I decided to try this brand since I use their foaming cleanser and their moisturizer and I&#x27;m in love with those products. Well after using this for a week (twice a day, everyday) my stretch marks on my thighs have faded and also aren&#x27;t as deep. I do recommend a derma-roller as well, but even after using this cream without the roller for 3 days, I noticed a difference. It&#x27;s not sticky, or super oily, and no weird smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with stretch marks between my shoulder and chest from weight lifting.  Totally agree with the other reviews as the product does not make the marks disappear but does lighten them rather distinctly.  Takes a couple of weeks before results become noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One quick note...I bought the same product from a very popular Arkansas based big box retailer company for $17.99.  You probably have one of these stores in your town.</li>
    <li> Not worth the false hope. After a full bottle Ive seen no results.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Very effective for stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this cream for about a week now. I apply it twice daily and ive noticed that my stretch marks aren&#x27;t as rough to the touch as they used to be and I feel that they are becoming less noticeable. It leaves a sticky feeling on your skin but I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it rubbing off onto my clothes. This is a resilient cream which wont rub off easily.</li>
    <li> All I can say is this stuff is amazing. I don&#x27;t have stretch marks, but my skin was getting really dry and crinkly. After just a couple of days I noticed a dramatic difference in my skin. I bought 3 more :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s another stretchmark product that I&#x27;m trying. I can&#x27;t testify to seeing any results yet, but the product itself is very mild on the skin, spreads easily, lasts all day. I&#x27;ll put this little number on my affected areas, wear it all day and by the time I&#x27;m ready to have a bath, the cream is still very present. All day wear, can I tell you? I hope to see results, but if not, the product is on my &#x27;like&#x27; list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The merchant was perfect. I got this product maybe a couple days after I purchased it, so I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep yah posted.</li>
