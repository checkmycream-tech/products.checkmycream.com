      <li>Bound to capture most anyones imagination.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never worn a cologne that&#x27;s gotten as many compliments -</li>
      <li>Favorite cologne of  all time</li>
      <li>More scent of a woman than a man.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT AND WOMEN TOO.</li>

      <li>Better than fragrance.net 😁</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll make sure when it&#x27;s time to order more, that I come here.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its simply the best.</li>
      <li>Brother in law loved it so much he bought one as well.  </li>
      <li>excellent as usual, my favorite fragance</li>
      <li>Bought this for my husband who is a huge Issey fan.</li>
      <li>This bottle is HUGE.  </li>
      <li>only the best cologne in my adult life &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Designer Issey Miyake has accomplished something rare and gorgeous with his signature scent for men.</li>
      <li>bottle is authentic Issey and is priced right.</li>
      <li>be it no fault of Amazon, I am writing this review for my Caribbean people, just so you can be aware to not buy any perfume online more that 100 mls..</li>
      <li>This is my husbands favorite Cologne, I didn&#x27;t realize how LARGE the bottle was but</li>
      <li>Super buy.</li>
      <li>if you do not mind both the originality and want to go for a safe option and well known before trying something new, this is your perfume.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it is the real thing</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells sexy, but my God, my 41 year old husband will be retired before he ever uses this up!</li>
      <li>as expected , good product , recommended.</li>
      <li>Unlike most cologne it&#x27;s not heavy or over-powering.</li>
      <li>and this is a great price, since it is a lot more expensive when bought in stores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest trying it on in a store at first to see how you like it and then splurging if it&#x27;s something you like.</li>
      <li>Just a great cologne and the sent will last a long time.  </li>
      <li>A couple of spurts and the whole room smells fresh.</li>
      <li>I purchased for a present, and I received the product on time and with the packaging ok.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh, long-lasting and far superior to other comparable products.  </li>
      <li>Masculine, and clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>TO ANY TIME MAKE YOU SERIOUS ELEGANT HANDSOME</li>
      <li>This bottle was so large</li>
      <li>Large bottle at discounted price.  </li>
      <li>Very fruity scent and very summery.</li>
      <li>you know they didn&#x27;t skimp on essential oils - and to find the largest 6.8 ounce bottle at such a great price is a terrific value.</li>
      <li>as compared to current much smaller bottle he owns - it is a dead ringer and a great bang for your buck!</li>
      <li>buy it duty free if you travel, or buy it locally..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how good I smell and this is all due to this cologne.</li>
      <li>The owner wanted to send it back with original packing wjich I had already discarded.</li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s a bit of orange blossom and a musk that that&#x27;s not thick and leather</li>
      <li>I had never seem such a big bottle, but worth every dollar!</li>
      <li>This cologne was purchased as a Christmas Gift for our 36 year old son per his request.  </li>
      <li>Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 18yr old son.</li>
      <li>This bottle is the size of an adult shoe.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s faint and clean with evocations of beaches and fresh balmy winds.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is barely discernible and wears off almost immediately.</li>
      <li>Issey is devoid of anything heavy or obtrusive where as most colognes tend to scream for attention this one whispers, you catch a glimpse of it so it to speak and even then only from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am from Trinidad, an island in the Caribbean, unfortunately, I was unaware that any item, with a high content of alcohol, will require me to pay a further, 15 usd, to be able to ship from the US to the Caribbean, after already paying 73 usd, for this product...</li>
      <li>The front notes are floral without being sweet or cloying the center notes are faint with touches of sandal wood, sweet grass and jasmin and the trail of the scent is the most difficult to describe to you</li>

    <li> Always love the Issey!! Great pricing as well!!</li>
    <li> Designer Issey Miyake has accomplished something rare and gorgeous with his signature scent for men. Unlike most cologne it&#x27;s not heavy or over-powering. It&#x27;s faint and clean with evocations of beaches and fresh balmy winds. The front notes are floral without being sweet or cloying the center notes are faint with touches of sandal wood, sweet grass and jasmin and the trail of the scent is the most difficult to describe to you but there&#x27;s a bit of orange blossom and a musk that that&#x27;s not thick and leather like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never worn a cologne that&#x27;s gotten as many compliments - almost always it&#x27;s described by people as \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; and \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and it is. Issey is devoid of anything heavy or obtrusive where as most colognes tend to scream for attention this one whispers, you catch a glimpse of it so it to speak and even then only from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With surprisingly long lasting power you know they didn&#x27;t skimp on essential oils - and to find the largest 6.8 ounce bottle at such a great price is a terrific value. Years ago only Sephora carried this size at a whopping $175 so this is an excellent buy. Bound to capture most anyones imagination.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume, Its really great. After trying so many brands this is my go to now.</li>
    <li> Very good product and service</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my son, he loves it!</li>
    <li> My husband was so happy...</li>
    <li> My partner uses this cologne and it&#x27;s often hard to find this larger-sized bottle. This Christmas, all the local stores had smaller bottles selling for almost the same price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is authentic Issey and is priced right. I&#x27;ll make sure when it&#x27;s time to order more, that I come here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> everything perfect no problems, thank you very much. The preferred user. THX</li>
    <li> Bad product. The fragrance is barely discernible and wears off almost immediately. This is definitely not the same thing I purchase from my local brick and mortar retailer.</li>
    <li> as expected , good product , recommended.</li>
    <li> I think this product is fake, the fragrance does not last long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Issey Miyake for years, and the smell never ceases to amaze me, as well as others around me. I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how good I smell and this is all due to this cologne. I admit colognes are variable in that what may smell good on some wont smell good on others, but this one is a true winner for me. I&#x27;d suggest trying it on in a store at first to see how you like it and then splurging if it&#x27;s something you like. As always, Amazon service was amazing.</li>

    <li> This is my husbands favorite Cologne, I didn&#x27;t realize how LARGE the bottle was but the price for size I thought was great. When it arrived I thought it was a joke. I had never seem such a big bottle, but worth every dollar!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Just like at the department store but cheaper.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, recommended 100%</li>
    <li> Bottle was bigger than I imagined,  should last at least a year with heavier than average usage</li>
