      <li>Be careful not to use too much, or you can see it in your hair and may look greasy.  </li>

<li> I still miss the blue grey in jars</li>
<li> Obviously I like the   product, or I wouldn&#x27;t have used it this long.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 40 years and it&#x27;s the only hairdressing that I used for my hair ,enough said!!</li>
<li> My only complaint is that this size is not sold in stores and I can only order this size online.</li>
<li> I got absolutely no response from the merchant or Ebay.  </li>
<li> Alberto products are getting harder to find in department stores.</li>
<li> And then the hair is not real oily.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve used other hair dressing over the years, but none compares to v05.&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter-in-law uses it to condition leather goods.  </li>
<li> Seriously, this is not the first time this has been complained about ...</li>
<li> No leaks but hard to open.</li>
<li> Only complaint was that it was all gooey when we opened the box.  </li>
<li> This VO hair dressing works in taming the hair down</li>
<li> Apply to hair and dry as usual.</li>
<li> I usually apply this product to wet hair, but it also helps to add a little to dry hair to tame flyaway hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I forgot to add we are Black family.</li>
<li> Odd to me</li>
<li> Just put a little bit in your hand and rub your hands together to heat and liquefy the product.</li>
<li> finding this product in jars instead of the tubes is not easy</li>
<li> and I needed something to tame flyaways.</li>

    <li> Great for protecting hair  (from hot appliances) and also gives it a nice shine.  Be careful not to use too much, or you can see it in your hair and may look greasy.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years and is a more economical product than the little tubes.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Dad for Christmas.  Can&#x27;t buy it in stores where I live anymore and it is a must have product.  Great product.</li>
    <li> David Berve in the first review was very correct about the jars. I ordered 3 jars and one jar top was loose and leaked the conditioner all over the other jars. I know that Amazon can do better packaging. With the shipping issue aside, I LOVE the fact that the hairdressing product is found in these jars for a great price. I see why this product is so expensive, because it works perfectly with either wet or dry hair. Also, this product contains no water or alcohol, which is why you only need a little of it to make your hair soft and sexy. My grandmother uses the version for gray hair and I was visiting and I needed something to tame flyaways. I saw the tube and I decided to try a bit and I fell in love. I searched for a non-gray hair version, found it, and have been hooked every since.     Buy this product you will not be sorry, and you will get more for your money buying the jars versus the tubes.</li>
    <li> i have used this product for yearts as it give my haair a beautiful sheen  and enhances the look of my hair</li>
    <li> I love this product. I stumbled upon this product about 25 years ago and have been using it ever since. It does a great job of reducing frizz (whether I wear my hair curly or straight). Hair will stay soft unless you use too much of this product... then your hair will just feel stiff and icky. I usually apply this product to wet hair, but it also helps to add a little to dry hair to tame flyaway hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this product to lots of people over the years and all of them love it and still use it too.</li>
    <li> I have been using vo5 for many years.  I have gray hair that is briddle and vo5 keeps my hairs easier to manage.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it does not leave my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product and grate price.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this size of this product in the stores and my husband loves it.  It smells good, too.</li>
    <li> Wonderful to find this item conveniently packaged in threes. My husband was ecstatic!! Nice surprise for Christmas....will continue to order to keep him stocked up in the future.</li>
    <li> Nothing else like it! been a user for over 40 years. Odd to me that Walgreens no longer stocks such a great product.</li>
    <li> Thanks sooo much. Timely and the order is exact...!!!</li>
    <li> Alberto products are getting harder to find in department stores. I have used the hair conditioner for many years. No other brand can compare.</li>
    <li> Have always used VO5.  My mother introduce us to it and been using it for the past fifty years. Passing on to grands.  I forgot to add we are Black family.</li>
    <li> My husband has used VO5 for years and when we found the jar at Wal Greens we started getting it.  The one near us doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore so he went to your web site to see if he could get it.  He like the convenience as it last longer.  And because of the size it saves money over the tubes.  Even though it cost more to buy then the tube, it is larger so it goes farther.</li>
    <li> This product is so good for my hair..  Keeps the hair moist and free from breaking.  And then the hair is not real oily.</li>
    <li> Came on time and packaged nicely. It was as if I bought the pack from the actual store itself. Also a great deal!</li>
    <li> I am very happy, I have been looking for this for years. Keep up the good work and I will be get much more from y&#x27;all. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years!  This is the only product that will calm my frizzy curly hair!</li>
    <li> The product came damaged with a broken jar that oozed out all over the rest of the contents. When we tried to get reimbursed or just have the broken jar replaced we were never contacted by anyone. The product is fine but we lost a whole jar because of the way it was packed</li>
    <li> husband only uses this brand</li>
    <li> Only complaint was that it was all gooey when we opened the box.  One of the jars had a hole in the bottom and leaked.  Amazon was great though and we got a refund.</li>
    <li> Great product used it for years.</li>
    <li> I still miss the blue grey in jars</li>
    <li> I have been using Vo5 for years.  It&#x27;s great.  I just have one negative comment. I bought 3 jars but one is only 1/2 full. That did not make me super happy.  Otherwise this product is great.  Donna F</li>
    <li> it is the best hair cream I have ever used.  The tub is by far the economical way to go.</li>
    <li> Hard to find product not in stores for my dad, but you made it easy to order and deliver, thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for something like 55 years and have had a difficult time getting it in the 6oz jars.  Obviously I like the   product, or I wouldn&#x27;t have used it this long.</li>
    <li> I  have used VO5 for  50+ years.  I am sorry that Walgreens no longer carries .the 6oz jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably use a couple of 6oz jars every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product !</li>
    <li> this was used on my hair ago fifty years when i was a child. so very pleased to find it and at rock bottom price. it&#x27;s light on your hair and makes hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 40 years and it&#x27;s the only hairdressing that I used for my hair ,enough said!!</li>
    <li> New Packaging problem.  The product is great but packaging is still a problem.  Plastic was placed under the lid which made it almost impossible to open.  I had to place the jar in hot water which then melted some of the product.  No leaks but hard to open.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair product for over 20 years and love it. I have frizzy, curly hair and this stuff really helps to tame the frizz. Just be sure not to use too much of this product. A little goes a long way. Just put a little bit in your hand and rub your hands together to heat and liquefy the product. Apply to hair and dry as usual.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as the description, thanks!</li>
    <li> This company did what I expected them to do  Excellent</li>
    <li> Love this product, wish the manufacturer still made this.</li>
    <li> Lid came off and slimy goop covered the inside and outside of the box.  Seriously, this is not the first time this has been complained about ... Product great, though. Thx</li>
    <li> Really believe that this is why I have no bald spots and a very healthy head of hair at age 70&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Alberto VO5</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom who has been using it for years. The delivery was less than a week and came in good condition. I however wished the 3 items came in a box rather that a heavy-duty plastic bag.</li>
    <li> shipping was horrible.  the product was damaged.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products ever ! My mother has been using this since the fifty&#x27;s. You can not say enough great things.</li>
    <li> Love VO5, very good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used VO5 for years and have found nothing better.</li>
    <li> Now my husband uses it every day and I still do, too.  It makes our hair lay better, gives a healthy shine and makes our hair so manageable.  We&#x27;ve used other hair dressing over the years, but none compares to v05.&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter-in-law uses it to condition leather goods.  We won&#x27;t be without it ever again.  I was so glad to see it in Drug Store.com at such a reasonable price.  It&#x27;s gotten pretty hard for us to find in the stores, anyway.</li>
    <li> Hair is a lot more manageable after a shower, using this hair dressing. Showers take away the hair oils.  This VO hair dressing works in taming the hair down</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it is no longer available at our local Walgreens stores.  Finding it on your site gives a year&#x27;s supply of something I use every day.</li>
    <li> finding this product in jars instead of the tubes is not easy</li>
    <li> The best hair moisturizer I have ever had! I am natural and like to have straight styles. I apply to my scalp and let the product do the rest. It gives my hair bounce, shine, no fly-aways, and my hair is very soft. I have been using this product for at least 5yrs. My only complaint is that this size is not sold in stores and I can only order this size online.</li>
    <li> I like the product very much, and have been using it for years now!  The merchant was terrible and then some.  The product was poorly packed and the contents were all over the inside of the box.  I got absolutely no response from the merchant or Ebay.  Very, very dissatisfied!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived intact, no damages  :)</li>
    <li> Product is great. The issue with the order was taken care of immediately. I am completely satisfied!</li>
