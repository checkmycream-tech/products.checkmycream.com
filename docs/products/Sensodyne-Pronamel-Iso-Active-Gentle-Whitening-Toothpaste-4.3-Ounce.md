      <li>THE WHOLE FAMILY GRABS THESE AND HIDES THEM BECAUSE THEIR TEETH LOOK, TASTE, AND FEEL GREAT EVERYDAY</li>
      <li>I have used this product exclusively since it first came on the market.  </li>
      <li>It does release some toothpaste after the first use.</li>
      <li>The iso-active foaming action keeps my mouth fresh and clean and the gentle whitening is just that.  </li>
      <li>great toothpaste but really hard to find at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>It takes a while to get used to, but overall I love the new sensation.</li>
      <li>It works great on my super sensitive poor teeth &amp; gums.  </li>
      <li>Cleans my teeth, protects a sensitive tooth (no cavity, but, a receding gum line according to my dentist), and brightens my smile.  </li>
      <li>it varies every morning and night with how much is lost but</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>The tube version is very soupy and tastes awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not much but notable...</li>
      <li>, It gets really foamy in your mouth, which I like because it touches every area of my mouth and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy 6 cans as apposed to 3 twin packs of the paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it really does make you feel like you are getting a deep clean.</li>

      <li>This will go a long way towards your goal of a pain free mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just wanted to update and it restores one&#x27;s faith in products, that they pay attention to things that absolutely NEED TO BE FIXED!  </li>
      <li>I rated this product a 4 because it does meet the ”high end</li>
      <li>I like the toothpaste, great for sensitive teeth, but the bottle oozes a lot, not just a little.</li>
      <li>Have used before for several years and this is the first time I had this problem.</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE PREMIERE PRODUCT THAT I AM WILLING TO PAY EXTRA FOR.  </li>
      <li>I like how it foams up, especially because you don&#x27;t need much product to get the job done.</li>
      <li>the foaming action of the iso-active made it so</li>
      <li>Looks as though they fixed their problem and now it works as it should--</li>
      <li>, I also have sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Sensodyne for over a decade now because of sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>She has sensitive teeth and some acid erosion.</li>
      <li>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in all non natural or non sensitive  toothpastes.</li>
      <li>It leaks after each use and builds up so the next time you go to use it you have to wipe off the wasted paste before it will let more out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m all for new &amp; better packaging, but this just no good.  </li>
      <li>I had a normal cleaning vice deep cleaning.</li>
      <li>things I love about this product are the fact that when you use the canister, it comes out as a gel (similar to shaving cream if you use it), it starts to foam up slightly when you let it sit on the brush with a little bit of moisture.</li>

<li> Complete waste of money.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but was not surprised when I saw the reviews.</li>
<li> My teeth are not sensitive anymore!</li>
<li> Save yourself the mess and buy their standard tube version.</li>
<li> It does create waste and the toothpaste is on average 5-7 dollars so the waste adds up if you use it as much as I do.</li>
<li> out a little faster than a tube and getting the last bit out</li>
<li> The pressure sucks, so when you get near the end of the tube you can&#x27;t fully empty it.</li>
<li> It leaks, as others have said, and in my case, two cans have completely shut down with at least 3/4 of the&lt;br /&gt;contents</li>
<li> They used to have 2 versions but  i&#x27;m assuming the other one did not do well with consumers.&lt;br</li>
<li> It feels like there is at least half a can left, yet I cannot get anything to come out of it no matter how long I sit there and hold the button.</li>
<li> My only complaint: it dries up</li>
<li> on average I go through a can every 2 months.</li>
<li> /&gt;Again, LOVE the tooth paste, HATE the packaging.  </li>
<li> /&gt;They clearly didn&#x27;t test their product before releasing this new packaging, or they would have seen how bad it</li>
<li> you have to press a little harder and wait a few seconds before the gel comes</li>
<li> AT THE DENTIST ARE LESS OF A &#x27;PAIN IN THE BUTT&#x27;</li>
<li> little does come out after you are done while the pressure bleeds off.  </li>
<li> This leaves a little paste that drys at the tip.</li>
<li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, and a little messy since a little of the product does ooze out of the opening after each use, but if that&#x27;s the price I have to pay for pain-free teeth, I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before and it&#x27;s often difficult to get toothpaste out when the pump is getting closer to empty, but never before when there was still half a can left in the container.</li>
<li> and you always have to wash the dried foam from the can, but</li>
<li> This is a really messy way to brush your teeth.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not easy to use either.</li>
<li> Unfortunately the pump quit with about half of the tooth paste left in container.</li>
<li> Thought I&#x27;d try the new dispenser, but the new dispenser is TERRIBLE.  </li>
<li> I mean it keeps going through the night and makes a ginormoys mess (see my uploaded pic).</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not famous for going to the dentist when I should but</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how this product is still on the shelves with all the negative feedback on this product.</li>
<li> It loses one star because of the design flaw.</li>
<li> Because this paste expands a bit when you dispense it, there is always some paste that leaks out slowly after you&#x27;re done using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Just look at the customer pictures to see what I mean.  </li>
<li> Not only does it waste product, but it makes a horrible mess.  </li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This toothpaste does a good job on cleaning my teeth and leaves my mouth feeling clean too.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this in my town anymore.  Delighted to find it on Amazon.  I hope the manufacturers keep making this product.  I like it so much better than the paste.</li>
    <li> good taste... like it a lot</li>
    <li> Addendum: Because I like the product,(not the original package) I tried it again recently--pressure can and all.  Looks as though they fixed their problem and now it works as it should--Just wanted to update and it restores one&#x27;s faith in products, that they pay attention to things that absolutely NEED TO BE FIXED!  So, kudos to Sensodyne for fixing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend the pressure can version of Sensodyne Toothpaste--any kind!  The can design is the worst I have ever seen.  It leaks, as others have said, and in my case, two cans have completely shut down with at least 3/4 of the&lt;br /&gt;contents still inside!  This toothpaste is not a cheap price either--to have it lock up and quit dispensing after two or three uses is just plain bad business!  I tried to address this on the Glaxco-Welcome website and their website works like their cans! It doesn&#x27;t!  Can&#x27;t even leave my comments there for them to see because it will not accept them.  My advice: don&#x27;t buy Sensodyne in the pressurized cans! EVER!</li>
    <li> This is a really messy way to brush your teeth.  It&#x27;s not easy to use either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sensodyne for over a decade now because of sensitive teeth. When the iso-active type toothpaste became available; I tried it and stayed with it. I&#x27;m not famous for going to the dentist when I should but the foaming action of the iso-active made it so I had a normal cleaning vice deep cleaning.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works great.  No sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Great taste and texture&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the tube Sensodyne.  The tube version is very soupy and tastes awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Runs out a little faster than a tube and getting the last bit out is tough.&lt;br /&gt;A little does come out after you are done while the pressure bleeds off.  Not much but notable...</li>
    <li> If I could give this zero stars I would. The store didn&#x27;t have the tube so I got the can. After several days of use I could not taste anything! I&#x27;m not sure how this product is still on the shelves with all the negative feedback on this product. And people saying it tastes like shaving cream your 100% correct. I thought I maybe needed to shake the can but nothing. Avoid this can and stick the tube!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE PREMIERE PRODUCT THAT I AM WILLING TO PAY EXTRA FOR.  THE WHOLE FAMILY GRABS THESE AND HIDES THEM BECAUSE THEIR TEETH LOOK, TASTE, AND FEEL GREAT EVERYDAY THEY USE IT- PLUS, DENTAL CLEANINGS AT THE DENTIST ARE LESS OF A &#x27;PAIN IN THE BUTT&#x27; BECAUSE BRUSHING AND FLOSSING IS &#x27;EASIER&#x27;.</li>
    <li> great toothpaste but really hard to find at a reasonable price.  It&#x27;s the only toothpaste I use.</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of Sensodyne Pronamel tooth paste, and have used it for years.  Thought I&#x27;d try the new dispenser, but the new dispenser is TERRIBLE.  Because this paste expands a bit when you dispense it, there is always some paste that leaks out slowly after you&#x27;re done using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m all for new &amp; better packaging, but this just no good.  Not only does it waste product, but it makes a horrible mess.  Just look at the customer pictures to see what I mean.  You&#x27;ll end up with the cover filled with unused tooth paste, and it leaks everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They clearly didn&#x27;t test their product before releasing this new packaging, or they would have seen how bad it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, LOVE the tooth paste, HATE the packaging.  Save yourself the mess and buy their standard tube version.</li>
    <li> I had bleeding gums and between this, mouthwash and and electric brush, it is all cured now.  I really like it, I also have sensitive teeth and this is perfect for them.  My only complaint: it dries up and you always have to wash the dried foam from the can, but I guess that&#x27;s inevitable since it is a foam.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  Does a great job with sensitive areas.  The iso-active foaming action keeps my mouth fresh and clean and the gentle whitening is just that.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is fine. The dispenser is terrible. It leaks after each use and builds up so the next time you go to use it you have to wipe off the wasted paste before it will let more out. For me, I&#x27;ll just get the tube.</li>
    <li> I have been using this tooth paste for about 2 years now. They used to have 2 versions but  i&#x27;m assuming the other one did not do well with consumers.&lt;br /&gt;The things I love about this product are the fact that when you use the canister, it comes out as a gel (similar to shaving cream if you use it), it starts to foam up slightly when you let it sit on the brush with a little bit of moisture. When you do start to brush your teeth, you&#x27;ll notice that it starts to foam up lightly-not enough to have a noticeable expansion but enough to realize that this is something really different. I love how it creates these microscopic  bubbles that really do feel like it&#x27;s getting between your teeth and it really does make you feel like you are getting a deep clean. It takes a while to get used to, but overall I love the new sensation. Your whole mouth feels clean when you finish brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I dislike about the product is in fact the canister design. It does release some toothpaste after the first use. I have yet to get a can that does not do this. it varies every morning and night with how much is lost but on average I go through a can every 2 months. This is brushing every morning and night. sometimes when you get halfway through the can you have to press a little harder and wait a few seconds before the gel comes out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall. I rated this product a 4 because it does meet the ”high end just visited a dentist feel&amp;#34; and it really makes your mouth feel clean. It loses one star because of the design flaw. It does create waste and the toothpaste is on average 5-7 dollars so the waste adds up if you use it as much as I do. I will continue to use this product and hopefully they will redesign the canister.</li>
    <li> all i can say is wonderful product!! It makes mouth feel so clean and fresh i cant believe ihave not used it before!!!! everyone should try this product</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste that will get rid of my tooth sensitivity. Regular Sensodyne in a tube didn&#x27;t do it, so I guess the iso-active formula is the key to its effectiveness. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, and a little messy since a little of the product does ooze out of the opening after each use, but if that&#x27;s the price I have to pay for pain-free teeth, I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product exclusively since it first came on the market.  It works great on my super sensitive poor teeth &amp; gums.  In fact since the drug store stopped carrying this particular gel type I have had more issues with sensitivity even though I switched to the &amp;#34;old fashion&amp;#34; tube sensodyne.  I am happy to find it here &amp; will buy several to stock up for the upcoming sweets season.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s and my favorite toothpaste. She has sensitive teeth and some acid erosion. Pronamel has made her teeth less sensitive and has stopped the acid erosion from progressing. It was recommended by her dentist. She and I prefer the isoactive formula because it really does foam when we brush, and it gets hard-to-reach places better that way. We use Pronamel isoactive whitening with our Sonicare Elite toothbrush. It&#x27;s the best way we&#x27;ve found to brush our teeth.</li>
    <li> This does not work as well at desensitizing as before.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but was not surprised when I saw the reviews. The toothpaste is good. I like how it foams up, especially because you don&#x27;t need much product to get the job done. I had no issues with the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging, however, is the worst toothpaste packaging I have ever encountered. As some have mentioned, some product does ooze out between uses, so that is annoying. My biggest problem was the fact that within a couple of weeks, the can stopped working altogether. It feels like there is at least half a can left, yet I cannot get anything to come out of it no matter how long I sit there and hold the button. For a while, I thought the nozzle might just have been clogged, so I tried running it under warm water and tried removing any blockage with a toothpick, but Fate had decided that I had gotten my fair share of toothpaste out of that canister. I eventually gave up and threw it away.</li>
    <li> Goofy container. If your mouth gums, or tounge get irritated, or sores pop up it may be time to switch to an SLS free toothpaste. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in all non natural or non sensitive  toothpastes. It is a powerful irritant, and is a mouth culprit for pain, redness, and ulcers.  This will go a long way towards your goal of a pain free mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients - Potassium Nitrate 5% - Purpose - Antihypersensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Fluoride 0.15% w/v Fluoride Ion - Anticavity.&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients Water, Sorbitol, Hydrated Silica, Glycerin, Flavor, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Saccharin, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Sodium Hydroxide.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! I have an issue with getting mouth ulcers. My doctor and dentist both told me to try using a different type of toothpaste. This one was on the list along with a few others (most of them &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;) and this one was the best tasting and feeling.  The only reason I can not give a five star rating is because of the whip off that is required every morning and evening when I use it. The can continues to push out after you are done loading up your brush. This leaves a little paste that drys at the tip.</li>
    <li> This can of toothpaste is like squeezing out shaving gel on your tooth brush. It has a better taste then the squeeze tube, there is more paste in each can then there is in a tube, It gets really foamy in your mouth, which I like because it touches every area of my mouth and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy 6 cans as apposed to 3 twin packs of the paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using Sensodyne Pronamel in any form because I suffer from loss of enamel due to acid reflux and my dentist says that after my use of this stuff for 6 months I no longer have any further acid damage. This stuff really works!!!!</li>
    <li> The pressure sucks, so when you get near the end of the tube you can&#x27;t fully empty it.</li>
    <li> The dispenser will not work and I was unable to return. Complete waste of money. Have used before for several years and this is the first time I had this problem. Switched brands.</li>
    <li> I like the toothpaste, great for sensitive teeth, but the bottle oozes a lot, not just a little. I mean it keeps going through the night and makes a ginormoys mess (see my uploaded pic). Truth be told I have bought this many times, and this kind of mess never happened before. Maybe a defective bottle lot?</li>
    <li> My teeth are not sensitive anymore! I brush twice a day as instructed!!</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste!  Cleans my teeth, protects a sensitive tooth (no cavity, but, a receding gum line according to my dentist), and brightens my smile.  You will get foamy, but, it gets in every nook and cranny.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the pump quit with about half of the tooth paste left in container. I&#x27;ve bought this product before and it&#x27;s often difficult to get toothpaste out when the pump is getting closer to empty, but never before when there was still half a can left in the container.</li>
</ol>
