    <li> I used this as the primary color for my french tips. I paint them on, so the sheer paints perfectly over the white tips.</li>
    <li> not what I expected. its pretty much just clear polish.the picture makes it look like a light pink but its so sheer that its clear even with several coats</li>
    <li> Did not care for this color, but I will wear it in the summer. OPI is a good nail product.</li>
    <li> Love OPI..... this color is my go to color. Natural and neutral, sometimes it&#x27;s the best.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this highly, it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t chip after a few days.</li>
    <li> The polish was very different than the one illustrated.It was very clear in color rather than the pink as shown.</li>

    <li> This is pale but darker than OPI&#x27;s  &amp;#34; tickle my fancy&amp;#34; which I also like. I change color often &amp; will keep this in rotation. It is a pleasant neutral, especially when I am keeping my nails very short at times. Arrived quickly in bubble wrap.</li>

    <li> This OPI polish is very sheer which is what I like.  It has a very light sheen to it.  With two coats it is super translucent and barely noticeable except the for the sheen.  If you want a noticeable pink color, this isn&#x27;t the shade for you.</li>
