    <li> Great price and nice product. Quick service and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Never used it. Ordered the larger bottle. This is more of a travel size bottle.</li>
    <li> My haircutter introduced me to this product. It makes my hair behave. I use it every day and recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I love this product.. This keratin product excels above all others. I use the conditioner as well. Arrived quickly without any issues. Good job!</li>
    <li> This is one of the most magical hair shampoos for women over 40. As you get older your hair is not as smooth and this really makes it so that it looks young, full and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product</li>

    <li> Great product, great price.  I have really fine curly hair the shampoo gives my hair a better texture so it is not so frizzy.  I just wash my hair and also you need to use the keratin conditioner and then just let my hair air dry and my curls are nice and not so frizzy.  My hair will always be frizzy yet it does reduce the friz.  I use it every other day to avoid overdrying my hair because it is so fine.</li>
    <li> Simply Smooth is fine, but isn&#x27;t a &#x27;must have&#x27; product for me.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo, will purchase it again.  My hair is now shiny &amp; manageable, before it was frizzy and coarse.</li>
    <li> Had a mini keratin treatment, and realized the shampoo collection in my bathroom all had sodium chloride in them. I had used one sodium chloride shampoo in the past, and was not impressed. This shampoo was amazing, however. It really helps to calm my fine, frizzy hair without making it look thinner &amp; flat.</li>
    <li> I really have not noticed any difference in my hair being &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; at all :-(</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo to use if you have had a keratin treatment or you color your hair.  It smells good too and this a a great travel size.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my split hairs seal, and lay flat.  My hair feels so silky and smooth. Love this product, and will buy again.</li>
