    <li> poor quality, but doesn&#x27;t look bad</li>
    <li> This hairband is really small and short didn&#x27;t go across while back of head like picture describes. Luckily for me it was less than $2 so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m out off a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Extremely impressed with the professionalism of this company. Small issue I had was resolved easily and very very quickly. Extremely pleased and will order again soon.</li>
    <li> This piece is gives your hair a different touch. The one I received didn&#x27;t match the right side from the left side but I fixed it in less than 5 minutes. Here is a fast tip, I have very fine straight hair so I grab a little hair from the right &amp; a little from the left &amp; pin it back with bobby pins, and the combs sit great on the pins.  Although I wish the chains were a little longer, it&#x27;s a great piece, &amp; good price. Loved, loved the fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful piece of hair jewelry. It is difficult to stay in hair even though my daughter has thick hair. Extra help may need to be used.</li>
    <li> I love it my hairband. It&#x27;s very stylish. Everybody liked it and they asked me where i got it from.</li>
    <li> The metal for the chain and hair clips is very cheap.  It is Halloween costume quality, not something you&#x27;d want to wear out in public.  I paid under three dollars total, but wish I had spent much less. I was disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> its made with cheap materials--would not buy it from the store.  It is not solid and will probably break when you pull your hair back with it.</li>
    <li> item as described seems a little delicate, going to spray with clear spray paint to keep it from fading but looked amazing many compliments</li>
    <li> Cute and gets compliments. What I expected. Holding up and seems sturdy so far. No warping or discoloration or anything yet. I&#x27;ve had about a month and have worn 3-4 times. Combs a little rough but work great. So worth the price for the look.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and so subtle. It was a great addition to my New Years outfit.</li>
    <li> Is cute but it rusts really fast so if you&#x27;re looking to buy something that will last for a long time do not purchase this because it will not last it will turn!</li>
    <li> I am extremely impressed with this piece.  It is sturdy enough and the price is perfect.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> All I have to say it that this is one CLASSY Piece, I purchased for my neice last christmas and she wore it on picture day and even the teachers were asking where she got it.  I loved it so much I got one for myself and my three sisters.</li>
    <li> I thought this was so cute. It is really flimsy and broke the first time I tried to wear it.</li>
    <li> It tangled a lot and hard to put on, although it looks pretty at first</li>

    <li> This is very pretty, but some of the links are a little rusted.</li>
    <li> The concept of this head band is cool.  However if you have fine hair like I do... forget about it! It is almost impossible to get the side combs to stay in place.  It just slides out the hair.  I think if you have medium to coarse hair, this would work a lot better for you.  On another note, the chains tangle A LOT. But if you have the patience to untangle before each use, go for it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy, this item is a waste of money. I would rather buy a tropical smoothie with the money. This is  way too cheap bubble gum machine type cheap.</li>
    <li> Mine came tangeled somehow , so I only wore it once . When I tried to untangle it , it broke . But it is soo beautiful with a high bun .</li>
    <li> I love this headpiece. I always get compliments when I wear it. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it&#x27;s still hanging in strong.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. This thing is stupid. I would probably change the combs to clips though. Did not stay in place.</li>
