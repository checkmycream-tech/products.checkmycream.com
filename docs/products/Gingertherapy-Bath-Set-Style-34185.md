      <li>THE PACKING WAS GOOD.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s how good of quality it is.</li>
      <li>I did not expect it to be as attractive as the appearance on line, but it is and makes for a splendid gift for someone who is special to you.</li>
      <li>The products are nice, the price is right and it&#x27;s actually a great value!</li>
      <li>I purchased these baskets for a shower, and the women couldnt believe how many things were in it!</li>
      <li>Looks nice and makes nice presentation</li>
      <li>THERE IS NO BODY SPRAY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE FOR THE PRICE.  </li>
      <li>and I honestly could have found better items elsewhere.</li>

      <li>Great present for Christmas .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just nothing special to use.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t believe the soaps, lotions &amp; Salt are anything special.</li>
      <li>The actual gift is as good as the picture.</li>
      <li>I am honestly thinking about just throwing away a majority of this product and buying everything locally.</li>
      <li>She was pleasantly surprised with how elegant the set was.</li>
      <li>HALF AS GOOD AS THE DISCONTINUED AVON PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>thanks so much!</li>
      <li>I got this mainly for decoration.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product, reasonably priced, as one of those gifts for someone difficult to buy for.</li>
      <li>Not too big, nor too small - just right!</li>
      <li>I think if you were going to buy it for yourself to use, you could probably do something yourself that had exactly what you wanted for a little cheaper.  </li>

<li> IT ONLY HAS BODY WASH AND LOTION AND A BUNCH OF USELESS ITEMS.  </li>
<li> The bath salt smells just as bad as the sponge.</li>
<li> I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT HAD NO FRAGRANCE.  </li>
<li> Price wasn&#x27;t outrageous and that&#x27;s why I did give it 3 stars.</li>

    <li> I got this mainly for decoration.  It looks great with my bathtub.  I think it would make a great gift.  I think if you were going to buy it for yourself to use, you could probably do something yourself that had exactly what you wanted for a little cheaper.  But it does look great.  I read where some said the basket was low quality.  I don&#x27;t see that.  I think it looks just fine.</li>
    <li> A very nice gift basket.  Not too big, nor too small - just right!</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy and I would not cross the street to get another one! Items arrived in a wrapped basket but they all were upside down... Not very presentable for a present!</li>
    <li> The actual gift is as good as the picture. I did not expect it to be as attractive as the appearance on line, but it is and makes for a splendid gift for someone who is special to you.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, reasonably priced, as one of those gifts for someone difficult to buy for.</li>
    <li> I EXPECTED THIS PRODUCT TO AT LEAST SMELL HALF AS GOOD AS THE DISCONTINUED AVON PRODUCT.  I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT HAD NO FRAGRANCE.  IT ONLY HAS BODY WASH AND LOTION AND A BUNCH OF USELESS ITEMS.  THERE IS NO BODY SPRAY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE FOR THE PRICE.  BUT THAT IS A MOOT POINT SINCE THERE IS NO FRAGRANCE AT ALL!</li>
    <li> The sponge smells like some sort of chemical was used on it. The hand massage tool is indented and the prongs don&#x27;t stick out. The bath salt smells just as bad as the sponge. I am honestly thinking about just throwing away a majority of this product and buying everything locally. Every single item in the basket is manufactured in China and I honestly could have found better items elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This was a very nice bath set that my daughter, whom I sent it to as a gift, loved!  The products are nice, the price is right and it&#x27;s actually a great value!</li>
    <li> They liked it and probable want me to get them more.  The price was a little to high for what a person gets.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift several times and is always a hit</li>
    <li> Looks nice and makes nice presentation but I don&#x27;t believe the soaps, lotions &amp; Salt are anything special. Certainly not any spa I would have wanted to go to. I believe the bath salt was nothing more than table salt, not that I&#x27;m not into homeopathy or good old fashioned home health remedies, it&#x27;s just not how this production description read to me. It might have been my assumption. But the basket does make a nice looking addition to my quest spa bathroom and people are impressed when they see it. It&#x27;s just nothing special to use. Price wasn&#x27;t outrageous and that&#x27;s why I did give it 3 stars.</li>

    <li> This product was wonderful my friend really liked it for christmas and let me tell you it smells WONDERFUL I am so glad that I got this for her...she told me all of the bath stuff is alnmost gone</li>
    <li> For $40, your wife or partner will love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, it&#x27;s not the best quality bath basket you can buy, but my wife loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massaging scrub, loufa and basket are built well enough to be used again. And the ginger therapy scent is something that any woman can appreciate.</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES taking long baths, I got this for her a couple of months ago, and I am still a hero in the house, thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Very nice presentation. Something that can actually be used for decor in the bathroom or left in the guests bathroom when u have visitors.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT AS A GIFT FOR MY NEICE.  SHE TRULY ENJOY IT.  THE PACKING WAS GOOD.  DELIVERED IN TACK.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift for my aunt for a Christmas present.  She loves the smell.  Nice basket too :)</li>
    <li> The basket is beautiful looking, but the products are not as high quality as I thought they would be. Don&#x27;t think I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my sister in-law. She was pleasantly surprised with how elegant the set was. Great gift!</li>
    <li> This is a great gift, for me I&#x27;m using on my raffle table that&#x27;s how good of quality it is.</li>
