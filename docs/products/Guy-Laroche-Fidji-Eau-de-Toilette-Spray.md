      <li>Fidji has always has been my favorite spicy scent!</li>
      <li>Love Fidji forever!</li>
      <li>but still a nice scent .</li>
      <li>However, they liked it.</li>
      <li>And... she liked it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t seem to market this perfume in the US, but according to my childhood memories, this was my mother&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>Will order again and again &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I am really satisfied by the product.</li>
      <li>One of my all time favorite fragrances...along with J&#x27;ai Ose.  </li>
      <li>Just gets better.</li>
      <li>I am pleased.</li>
      <li>Favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>Ever since I smelled Fidji by Guy Laroche, it is and will always be my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>Wealthy friends of my Swiss auntie wore it and that&#x27;s how it started for me.</li>
      <li>The scent is truly elegant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The combination of Hyacinth, Lemon, Bergamont, Carnation, Jasmine, and Rose - make it a unique and pleasing</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like florals so well, but I always loved Fidji.</li>
      <li>I had originally purchased this perfume in France for my wife many years ago.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t easy find this product</li>
      <li>would recommend to anyone that likes light floral fragrances.</li>
      <li>The service was just great, but smells different.</li>
      <li>Floral and light</li>
      <li>This is the greener smelling version - not the more soft floral one - but still nice.</li>
      <li>Is much softer than the original version, the formula have change, but still kind of a hint of the good old smell.</li>
      <li>It smells clean, not flowering or fruity is just right, specially for a youg girl</li>
      <li>The aroma took me back in time, I love it!</li>
      <li>Fidji of old had a fantastic scent.</li>
      <li>I searched the web , looking for this, after someone mentioned , how this was my favorite back in the eighties, and I wondered if they still made it.</li>
      <li>Am delighted to have my long time favorite perfume again--one of the few with no allergy problems for me.</li>
      <li>I have loved this scent for over 50 years, and although I am unable to find it retail, I am grateful that I am able to get it through Amazon.com at a reasonable cost.  </li>
      <li>Except there was white paper sticker on top of the transparent film with some digital code and a suspicious word &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; on it.</li>
      <li>As usual  the service was good, packing was done properly, arrived on time.</li>
      <li>The perfume literally seemed to be scented with salt; it was complex and sophisticated and really beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A natural perfume, has been on the Market for quite a long time, but is worth trying.</li>
      <li>Clear this one, it is not a disadvantage of amazon but of the manufacturers of fidji because lamentably they have lowered the quality of fragrance of the perfume fidji.</li>
      <li>Same fast delivery, about 3 days from order date.</li>
      <li>but it had a scent of the ocean, if you&#x27;ve ever lived near it.</li>
      <li>I still enjoyed the scent, it is a little different from what I remember, I think it has changed  formula a little.</li>
      <li>As difficult as it is to find in stores, it was just that easy to order online!</li>

    <li> I searched the web , looking for this, after someone mentioned , how this was my favorite back in the eighties, and I wondered if they still made it. of course I found it at Amazon.com. Like a lot of things, your memories are not  able to live up to  reality. I still enjoyed the scent, it is a little different from what I remember, I think it has changed  formula a little. but still a nice scent . I have worn it several times and got a few complements.</li>
    <li> Fidji has always has been my favorite spicy scent! As difficult as it is to find in stores, it was just that easy to order online!</li>
    <li> My mother wore this in the 70&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ve bought it when I could find it in the decades since. Fidji of old had a fantastic scent. I don&#x27;t really like florals so well, but I always loved Fidji. Floral and light but it had a scent of the ocean, if you&#x27;ve ever lived near it. The perfume literally seemed to be scented with salt; it was complex and sophisticated and really beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is very different now. Just a typical floral perfume and certainly not worth the price, such a shame.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite fragrances...along with J&#x27;ai Ose.  Have worn these for years and years.  Just gets better.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. This one has a terrible bitter sulfur smell! I have never paid so much for such fake quality.</li>
    <li> Ever since I smelled Fidji by Guy Laroche, it is and will always be my favorite perfume. Wealthy friends of my Swiss auntie wore it and that&#x27;s how it started for me. It is unforgettable.</li>
    <li> The item arrived in good condition and was as advertised.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> The aroma took me back in time, I love it!</li>
    <li> Love Fidji forever! Same fast delivery, about 3 days from order date. Will order again and again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t seem to market this perfume in the US, but according to my childhood memories, this was my mother&#x27;s favorite. So now, 35 years later, I took a risk of ordering the same for my wife.  And... she liked it!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is as pleasant as I remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was very decent, no visible sign of fake. Except there was white paper sticker on top of the transparent film with some digital code and a suspicious word &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; on it. This caused me a pause: what do they mean, do they actually sell &amp;#34;Used&amp;#34; perfumes from same location?</li>
    <li> Good, but not the best quality</li>

    <li> Horrible smelling!! I had to say! I wasted my money and time !!!</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent for over 50 years, and although I am unable to find it retail, I am grateful that I am able to get it through Amazon.com at a reasonable cost.  The scent is truly elegant.</li>
    <li> I had originally purchased this perfume in France for my wife many years ago. I had problems finding it in the US until recently, This was an excellent deal on a good size dispenser of this great perfume. It came packaged well and arrived in a timely matter.</li>
    <li> A great fragrance. A natural perfume, has been on the Market for quite a long time, but is worth trying. Great seller too.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed-watered down version and slight scent that didn&#x27;t even linger.  Past scents not even similar.  Watered down or replica?</li>
    <li> As usual  the service was good, packing was done properly, arrived on time. I am not sure about the quality, because it was ordered for someone and delivered directly. However, they liked it. I am a great fan of this parfume, since 1989, when it was used by my wife, this time was bought as a gift for others.</li>
    <li> Have always (51 years) bought my wife&#x27;s perfume, her favorite is Joy (mine too) However along with some others she does a &#x27;crossover&#x27; and puts something else on. This is one.....could mean I&#x27;m in trouble sometimes....;)</li>
    <li> The service was just great, but smells different. Is much softer than the original version, the formula have change, but still kind of a hint of the good old smell. Sad to say, but will not purchase it again. I wish they go back to the same formula.</li>
    <li> Am delighted to have my long time favorite perfume again--one of the few with no allergy problems for me.</li>
    <li> Although product arrived in mew, sealed packaging, the fragrance was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  Cannot use it. Smells awful on.</li>
    <li> I like a pour bottle,  but it seems that the manufacturer don&#x27;t agree with me....they are hard to find...don&#x27;t know why...</li>
    <li> Excelent. It isn&#x27;t easy find this product</li>
    <li> I began using it in 1966 - received as a sample.  It&#x27;s flowery scent is pleasing yet not over powering. Reminds me of Spring time.&lt;br /&gt;The combination of Hyacinth, Lemon, Bergamont, Carnation, Jasmine, and Rose - make it a unique and pleasing perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone that likes light floral fragrances.</li>
    <li> It smells clean, not flowering or fruity is just right, specially for a youg girl</li>
