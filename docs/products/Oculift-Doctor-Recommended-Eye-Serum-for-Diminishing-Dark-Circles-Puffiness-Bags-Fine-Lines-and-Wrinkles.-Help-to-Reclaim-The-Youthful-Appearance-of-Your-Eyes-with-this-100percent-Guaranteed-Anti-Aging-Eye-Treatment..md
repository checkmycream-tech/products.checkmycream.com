<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I live in the upper Midwest where it&#x27;s freezing more than half the year. Oculift works well on the dark circles and puffiness caused by the cold.</li>
    <li> I had previously been using a neutrogena eye product and it worked well.  However, I have a habit of looking for something better.  I tried this specifically for the puffiness reduction.  My eyes are puffier than ever.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my eyes look awful. Horrible lines that I never had before. I&#x27;ll definitely be returning to neutrogena.</li>
    <li> My eyes used to be very attractive while I am in my twenty&#x27;s. But now because of work pressure and tension am very much tensed so started using various products and went in vain. Now after knowing this Oculift product, my eyes got back that vibrant energy and am very happy for that. There is lot of difference in my face even as those wrinkles are no more found in my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oculift for a few weeks now and have noticed a slight change in the area under my eyes.  I have very fine lines and puffiness in this area and was looking for something to address these problems.  Though the change has not been dramatic, I think it&#x27;s worth continuing to use this product.  I really love the feel of the cool gel under my eyes.  With continued application (and patience!), I may see more significant progress in the next several weeks.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product from amazon ...there was no more than 4 drops of serum in the bottle ,I got few days ago n now am struggling to get some serum out of the bottle which seems to be empty inside.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I had to stop using this product before I could judge accurately whether or not it was working.  I did feel some tightening of the skin around my eyes, but it seemed to cause my eyes to burn and tear, so I had to stop using it. I think over time it would benefit someone who is not allergic to it.</li>
    <li> I work swing shifts and a few days a week still have to wake up early. I look like hell sometimes. I was reluctant to use Oculift because I thought that kind of stuff was for women. Turns out, it works, getting rid of those raccoon eyes that I often get. Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product and I have tried plenty of others. I&#x27;m sticking with this one, it really works!</li>
    <li> I just star used this product, and I noticed big difference under my eyes, I want to tanks you for this great product.</li>
    <li> I have puffy, dark circles under my eyes no matter how much I sleep. My eyes are less puffy and brighter since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> In all fairness, this might just be me, but when I put it on, my eyes burned. I tried it two days later and the exact same result. I am disappointed that I paid so much for me not to be able to use it.</li>
    <li> This product gives good results and fast</li>
    <li> I have used this very consistently for 2 months now and I am really seeing a difference. If you use it for a week and expect it to take years off your face, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I work, go to college and have different other activities I engage in so it goes without saying I often don&#x27;t get enough sleep and the result...well&amp;#60; eye bags! I need this product! simple, small, easy to use and works great.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s great and worked within 2 weeks! I am 46, used to be a sun-goddess, now my eyes are paying for it. I tried this product, loved it! Goes on great under my  primer. The price isn&#x27;t crazy, considering I&#x27;ve tried so many others that have never worked! I&#x27;m done searching, and so happy to have younger-looking eyes! I&#x27;m not the only one who can notice.</li>
    <li> I have used Oculift anti-aging serum for 2 years , everyday without fail. My skin has not aged in 2 years!! I love it and no matter how much it costs, I will buy it. I started using it at 45 years old. My skin is still at 45 years old.</li>
    <li> I have used several serums purchased in department stores at a much higher cost, and I have to say I like this one the best so far. I like that it is scent-free, lightweight, and makes my skin feel tighter than an anti-wrinkle cream. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have one dark area on my left eye. I have used several products trying to lighten this area and this product works!&lt;br /&gt;I can really tell because now my eyes match. Love this!</li>
    <li> I have used the product for almost a month now and honestly cannot see any big improvements. I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a week and have notice a difference. My eyes are less puffy a I look less fatiged. Relly does lighten dark circles</li>
    <li> Helps with the puffiness and make my eyes look more lifted. I like it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Oculift for a couple of months now.  I noticed a big difference in the area around my eyes after the first month, even my daughter notice. The fine lines and darkness, which I hated, has smooth out and eyes look brighter. Even my sagging eyelids have tightened up. Wonderful product, great price compared to other more expensive products I bought and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.</li>
    <li> Have been using the serum in conjunction with the cream for a year now and it tightens my skin, seems to prevent fine lines and even though it may be pricey compared to some other age prevention regimes, a little goes a LONG way with this series.</li>
    <li> I haven’t been using this product for an extended time, but I have already noticed some changes in my skin. All you need is a small dab, and it covers the whole eye area. I have been able to see some pretty immediate results. I’m a horrible sleeper, so I have been using this to combat the bags under my eyes. From what I have noticed so far, it has helped with that. It seems to tighten up the skin underneath the eye, and rather quickly.</li>
    <li> This eye serum jam packed with Vitamin C smells like heaven, and you just need to place a little bit on your ring finger and dab it under both eyes around to the side of the eyes (my main problem area)! You can definitely feel it doing something when you apply it, but not too intense or chemically strong. After a few weeks of using this product, I have noticed a difference in dark circles are wrinkles - I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles, or wrinkles, but I do have puffiness. This eye serum is fantastic because it does reduce some puffiness. The formula moisturizes well and absorbs into my skin.</li>
    <li> I just bought the second container of Oculift . I am 65, so I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but I do think my eyes look good since I started using this. My eye area definitely does not look as lined as before I started to use it. I would recommend it for older skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I am a products junkie and I&#x27;ve used many different things but this is one of the only things that not only brightens and tones but it also depuffs.  Some of them puff my under eye area up trying to remove wrinkles so I have swelling under my eyes.  This one doesn&#x27;t do that.  It gets rid of the swelling and makes my eye area firm.  I like it. I quit using my Sonya Dakar stuff and started using this if that says anything.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get a lot of sleep so I really love how this product helps me reduce the look of being extremely tired all the time! It is the best one I have tried for reducing my under eye circles.</li>
    <li> Great for dark circles and bags under your eyes</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s primarily for use under your eyes, to combat dark circles, dry skin, fine lines &amp; wrinkled, puffiness....you know, all the signs of being a full-time employee/mom/wife/adult. You can apply it all over your (clean) face, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels cool, and a little bit goes a long way. It takes about 6 minutes to fully absorb into my skin, during which time it&#x27;s a bit tacky. But amazingly, there&#x27;s no irritation AND the product does what it says.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with other reviewers that this product is terrible.  It did not hydrate The skin under my eyes or help with any fine lines or dark circles.  In fact the consistency is very similar to hand sanitizer as someone has already mentioned.  It dried out the skin under my eyes horribly and cause the eyelids to look droopy in the corners.  It caused my skin to feel tight in a very unpleasant way and deepened all the lines around my eyes. It burns when I applied it.  And even three days after I stopped using it the skin under my eyes remained very sensitive to the touch. It almost feels like sunburn skin and I&#x27;m using vitamin EE now to fix the problem I strongly caution people to stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes the skin right away, doesn’t feel oily whatsoever. All the dark circles and fine lines around my eyes have completely disappeared! The effectiveness is long lasting too and I couldn’t be any happier!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the bright orange color discourage you! It&#x27;s so emollient and has lessened my under-eye circles TREMENDOUSLY! Also, the amount you get would last you forever! A MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> This serum is smooth and feels quite nice! I like it and I think others will like it too!</li>
    <li> I grew up having these dark circles under my eyes that made my face scary, even to me. I have been using this stuff for a little over a few months now and i can see the changes around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Wow what a great eye serum! It has a wonderful fruity smell and a nice color due to the Nexgen Biolabs as the company nicely informed me. This is loaded with incredible ingredients in one serum to tackle different problems. You definitely don&#x27;t need a lot and you just need to pat it all around your eyes. After it is dry the area around my eyes feel so refreshed and firm, fine line is smoother and in the morning there is less puffiness. I am very impressed. This eye cream does it all and is a favorite eye serum of mine!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but since I have loved every other Nexgen product that I have used, I decided to try it. Thank God I did. I love how my eyes look and my overall appearance.</li>
    <li> This product is very light, not greasy. I use it sparingly and it really lasts. It makes my skin feel so good and nourished. I have been using this about 3 months now and you can really see the difference. The skin around my eyes is more firm and youthful looking.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that diminishes any wrinkles around my eyes which are only starting to form, but I&#x27;m doing preventative measures. I love this product and seriously cannot go a day without it. If you have slight wrinkles I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> It is the BEST product out there to combat dull, uneven skin tone as well as lines and wrinkles! Your skin won&#x27;t believe you managed to live so long without this! I try to save each month to treat myself to another bottle but it is sooo worth it as there&#x27;s nothing out there I&#x27;ve tried that compares to this for skin tone and pigmentation correcting! Please give it a try and you&#x27;d see what I mean!</li>
    <li> Disappointing results, if any.</li>
    <li> This Nexgen product is AMAZING! This anti-wrinkle serum is probably my favorite eye treatment. I work late nights in a hospital and I never have dark circles anymore due to this serum.</li>
    <li> I have very dark circles and although they are not gone completely, they sure have faded a lot! I liked it, I have only been using it for 3 weeks so it is really working.</li>
    <li> I have used several different products over the years and this is by far the best. I have problems with allergic reactions to different products and I have had much success with this and my face is smoother and healthier looking.</li>
    <li> This product brought the radiance back to my eyes. People used to tell me how beautiful my large eyes were, but as I grew older those complements became less frequent. Since I started using this eye serum people have told me I look happier, refreshed, and even beautiful. This product wipes the saggy depressing tired look away from your eyes forever and gives you a lovely glowing new perspective!</li>
    <li> I normally use eye creams just for some hydration, to keep the outer corners of my eyes from getting really dry... but this is genuinely the first eye product I&#x27;ve ever used where I can also see a marked difference in my skin. The little lines and wrinkly bits under my eyes are largely gone, and the crows’ feet are definitely lessened!</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used. It is like a drink of water for your face. Try this you will see a noticeable difference in your skin.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of reducing dark circles around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Would order it again.</li>
    <li> It made no difference on my dark circles or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I tried sample packets of this, and my face was smooth right away. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I bought a bottle of this, and after 3 days my face is glowing, the bumpiness is ALMOST GONE, and my face is clearing up dramatically. I don&#x27;t know what is in this formula, but it&#x27;s not just for wrinkles. My forehead wrinkles do look a lot better, though, and it hasn&#x27;t even been a week.</li>
    <li> This just replaced everything that I have ever tried. I have both sensitive skin that is oily and prone to breakouts, but being over 50, I am fighting wrinkles as well. With this I just won the battle.</li>
    <li> This was a good serum.</li>
    <li> Great product. Definitely noticed a slight difference in my laugh lines and its only been 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I used this treatment for 5 months and it worked great as a moisturizer. I don&#x27;t have dark circles, puffy eyes or wrinkles. I do have saggy eye lids, which I was using Oculift for. I used it morning &amp; night faithfully. I have a 25% difference in my eyelids.</li>
    <li> Love the citrus scent, been using this for a little over a month and I think my skin looks better already!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using Oculift for a very long, but I have noticed that all the lines around my eyes are less noticeable. I won&#x27;t say that they are gone or that I believe they will go away, but they definitely are not as obvious as they were a week ago. The product as also reduced the puffiness under my eyes. Again, I don&#x27;t believe my bags will ever go away, but I haven&#x27;t looked sleep-deprived for the last couple of days, so I am calling this a win.</li>
    <li> Hydrates, renews, restores shine...skin feels great</li>
    <li> So I will admit that after using this for awhile that the skin around my eyes is in fact softer to the touch, less puffy, and seems to be smoother. The serum is a bright orange in color, and actually smells quite good. You just have to put a few drops on your finger, and gently press it from the inner corner to the outer corner of your under eye area. I received this product in exchange for my inspection and honest review, and I would recommend this to anyone wanting to make their eyes look a little bit younger.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I cannot use it because of the citrus like scent so I passed it along to my mom and she loves it and is seeing results.</li>
    <li> It goes on nicely, not sticky, and absorbs well. My wife&#x27;s makeup applies nicely over. This serum helps her lesson the depth of her lines and smooths her skin, improves the texture which tends to look a bit crepe like.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product the line are less noticeable</li>
    <li> In my forties, I started noticing that my skin was no longer as firm as it used to be.  The fine lines were slowly taking over my confidence. I stumbled upon Oculift quite accidentally and it just became a part of my skin care regime. I use it daily and people keep on guessing how I look so young</li>
    <li> Helps alleviate puffiness. I have high hopes for the long term use of this product. I love rose hips, brings back fond memories of hiking in the Rocky Mountains picking rose hips and making tea and jam. Rose hips contain a huge amount of vitamin C so I feel I can&#x27;t go wrong with this ingredient. fast shipping</li>
    <li> Not a 5 star item. Check the reviewers&#x27; profiles too before you order.</li>
    <li> I have tried Clarins, Estee Lauder and Oro Gold products in the past and have not been impressed with results. With Oculift, I did see results...within a week. I was so impressed with the immediate results that I purchased another bottle the following week. This is the real deal! It does was it’s advertised to do. Noticeable firmness!</li>
    <li> I am 70 years old and this is the best eye serum I&#x27;ve ever used!!&lt;br /&gt;The skin under my eyes gets puffy and saggy, but this product completely takes all of that away. I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is the ONLY one that actually does it. I would recommend it to anyone of any age. I will use it forever. It is AWESOME!!!!</li>
    <li> After just over a week using it, I&#x27;ve noticed I don’t need to apply concealer for my dark circles. While I haven&#x27;t noticed a little reduction in wrinkles, my skin texture is improving. Very happy with results so far!</li>
    <li> Reduces the crepe paper sags under my eyes!</li>
    <li> This goes on smoothly, does not sting my eyes, it is NOT greasy, my fine lines around my eyes are disappearing. My skin around my eyes feels soft and well moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other eye products to reduce the appearance of the fine wrinkles I am beginning to get. None worked nearly as well as this! It took two weeks for me to see the difference, but now I am thrilled with how well it is working! Will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> My first exposure to this product was when I received it as a sample, but I was so impressed with how it worked, I had to buy it. I love the way it feels and, with sensitive skin that reacts poorly to so many products, I was delighted there were no issues. My skin looks great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks...wrinkles so much smaller I can barely see them my dark circles are 60% better and my circles were really dark!!! I would buy it all over again my friends have said ....u look so rested...I look 10 years younger yep sure do. Don&#x27;t be a hate r&lt;br /&gt;.....just try it!!</li>
    <li> I inherited permanent eye bags from my father and assumed I couldn&#x27;t do anything about it, but after a week of using this there is a definite improvement.  And this is so cheap!  Why buy the $100 face creams from the department store when there&#x27;s this?</li>
    <li> I love this product. Skin glows</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-thirties. This past year I began to see the sagging of my checks, my wrinkles in my eyes, that stupid line between my eyebrows. I was thinking, &amp;#34;What is this? I&#x27;m finally done with my acne and now I have wrinkles?&amp;#34; I have to admit, I haven&#x27;t tried everything out there, but I know that Oculift works a lot better than the others.</li>
    <li> This serum smells light and fresh, feels soft and velvety, this serum seems to be helping to firm the little lines around my lips (not from smoking!). It seems to be resulting in firmer skin tone. I am happy with it at this time.</li>
    <li> This product is not that great. It is a cooling gel that tingles on application. Have no changes to dark circles under my eyes but it may help with puffiness.</li>
    <li> I really love Oculift  and was  running out of the product. So I purchased it and it seems to be just as good. I need more time to evaluate</li>
    <li> I have not been using this product long enough to give it a higher rating. I did base my purchase on its high ratings and I believe I just need to use it longer to see greater results. So far I&#x27;m kind of pleased and do intend to continue using it twice a day to give it a fair chance to make an improvement on the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Getting old is mandatory, growing old gracefully now there are options. I just turned 4o a few months ago and although I never smoked or drink alcohol, I do have the start of crows feet and some wrinkles on my forehead. So, I decided to try Oculift, eye serum. It is a complete solution that restores brightness, firmness and smooths skin around the eyes. It moisturizes the skin, diminishes dark circles and fine lines around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using Oculift my skin has improved in elasticity and I have reduced wrinkles around my eyes and forehead. I have a more awake appearance to my face and it seems a little brigher but really soft and smooth. I already have recommended my family and friends to try this product for all their complete facial needs. I recieved this product free for my unbiased review, although all thoughts, ideas and words  my own.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of its great reviews, gave it to my friend because she has problems sleeping so she has very dark circles under her eyes. Within a few days of her using it I can already see changes!</li>
    <li> BE VERY CAREFUL.. 98% of these reviews are fake. I ordered the product and have not seen any results, but only get a burning sensation on my face. DO NOT TRUST.</li>
    <li> Not bad helped dark circles, moderately helped puffiness but still not the miracle that I am looking for, decent for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with dark circles under my eyes for years. I have tried nearly all eye serum products out there and very few of them have worked. The ones that have worked are wildly expensive and I just couldn&#x27;t justify spending that amount of money. Finally there is an affordable product that works. Oculift has smoothed out the skin beneath my eyes and the dark circles are almost completely gone!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE Nexgen Biolabs products. I have many different ones and this one is not any less than those. I use this for the little fine lines around my eyes and am noticing a great improvement as well as prevention of those lines. Its definitely making a difference and I can tell my eyes look more supple and smooth. The liquid itself is a nice quality and a smooth texture. Its easily dispensed out of the bottle and is well worth the price. I know I will be buying another bottle once this one runs out. I just am very impressed with the great results of it and cant wait to see what another couple months will do!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not old enough to have to worry about anti aging just yet, but I do get quite dry around the eyes if I do not use an eye cream. Oculift moisturizes without being heavy or oily, and undereye concealer smooths over it gorgeously without balling up or creasing. It does not cause clogged pores and a little goes a LONG way for me, so I can imagine this bottle lasting a decent amount of time for the price. Perfect! :)</li>
    <li> This product is superior to the others I have tried! It feels so nice on, and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it either. After 2 weeks, I see a difference, not only in the way my skin looks, but the way it feels too. Definitely recommend, i will be reordering it when it runs out!</li>
    <li> The product helped me be more comfortable in my own skin. Oculift brought about such a change in my skin care regime. I used to spend thousands of dollars monthly on clinical treatments to maintain my appearance. Now it’s just one serum and I’m good to go.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, a friend had originally given me some to try.  I have always had issues with Dark Circles and I worry about the few lines that are starting to show around my eyes.  Since I started using Oculift, I can honestly say that the Dark Circles are now few and far between.  I have also noticed some tightening around the eye area and I&#x27;m hopeful that with continued use the lines I&#x27;m noticing will start to go away. I will post another review after I have used it for a little longer to let you know my continued results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that products like these often contain very strong ingredients.  People with overly sensitive skin can experience things like, burning and tingling and drying of the skin when using any product with ingredients that are not specifically designed for sensitive skin.  If you notice any of these symptoms when using any skin care product, discontinue use and seek a dermatologist to help find products that will not irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a flight attendant and have been looking for a very good anti-aging product! This stuff is not a miracle, but it works for my dry skin area around the eyes. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it&#x27;s not perfumed what is great for sensitive eyes! I have to repeat every 2 to 3 hours due to the dry cabin atmosphere, but it smoothes my eye area when I need it most.I will buy it again soon!</li>
    <li> Was nicely surprised this product has a great citrus smell. I used it under my eyes at night and it didn&#x27;t irritate or bother my skin which is important to me. I will continue using it I am trying to combat signs of aging and I think this product can help do that since its packed full of vitamins and other ingredients formulated to do that. Received a complimentary sample and the reviews and opinion are my own.</li>
    <li> I love this eye serum. I have been having more fine lines and dark circles under my eyes and this product does help. I like that it is not greasy,not too thick, but not too thin either. I highly recommend this product to help reduce dark circles and fine lines.</li>
    <li> It has a wonderful fruity smell and a nice orange color due to the Nexgen Biolabs as the company nicely informed me. This is loaded with incredible ingredients in one serum to tackle different problems. You definitely don&#x27;t need a lot and you just need to pat it all around your eyes. After it is dry the area around my eyes feel so refreshed and firm, fine line is smoother and in the morning there is less puffiness. I am very impressed. This eye cream does it all and is a favorite eye serum of mine!!</li>
    <li> I’m always ready to make myself look the best. Oculift is exactly what helped me achieve it! With this serum I was able to maintain myself when I don’t get enough sleep. (I work a lot so I tend to get tried every day) This really helped me look the best!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks, I see the change already, I love it.</li>
    <li> It works! It works good! I instantly saw results the first time I used it!</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this eye serum! I was sent a bottle to review which I&#x27;m so thankful for. When I saw that this was a bright orange, it was interesting to me. However, it blends in well and I don&#x27;t notice any orange residue near my eyes. I have hereditary dark circles that are hard to cover, even with concealer. This had been helping with that a little, and I&#x27;m noticing my dehydration lines getting plumped up as I use it. Great product Oculift!</li>
    <li> I have premature crows feet from too much sun and smiling, as well as pretty dark under eye circles. This serum takes care of both problems.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this eye serum, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m in love with it! It&#x27;s very rich and moisturizing, I&#x27;m still waiting to see the full on results, like treating fine lines, but I have to give it at least 1 month for that. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep buying it!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this serum and really enjoyed it so I thought I would give it a try. Usually I am let down when I buy the actual products. I have used EVERY super expensive cream and serum out there. I can honestly say this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. I never mentioned to anyone that I tried something different. My husband asked me if I was doing something different. He said my skin glowed and looked younger. My friends asked me if I lost weight. They said they could see it in my face, my skin looked so good. I&#x27;ve bought the serums from some very expensive brands and have been very disappointed even after using them for a while. With this product you&#x27;ll love it the first time and really see a difference over time. I look forward to putting this serum on every morning and night</li>
    <li> I suffer from chronic sinusitis which causes me to have very puffy eyes with dark circles under. couple that with hooded eyes I could see my eyelids when looking forward. I have been using vitamin c serum along with oculift.After a couple of weeks my dark circles are gone and there is a marked difference in the puffiness of my eyelids</li>
    <li> I began using Oculift a year or so ago and then ran out of it. After awhile, I noticed that my skin did not look as good as it had previously. I was redder on the cheeks and on the nose and my skin just did not appear as youthful. Hard to pinpoint exactly but I thought about my skin care regimen and what I had changed and it dawned on me that the only difference was that I was not using Oculift any longer. I immediately ordered a bottle and it is back to doing it&#x27;s job which is to help me look younger.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I thought my eyes looked younger. I thought the wrinkles and bagginess were less visible. Most people guess my age to be much younger than it is.</li>
    <li> I have used so many anti-wrinkle products that promise you the moon and everything in between, but somehow always fall short. This one is a keeper. It really does what it says it will. Especially for the aging woman. I love this product! It has a really good texture that is not too greasy. It is just a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I am 56 years old and Oculift eye serum is the best. It only takes a small amount for both eyes. It moisturizes without being greasy like a lot of eye creams and serums. I have noticed a definite decrease in wrinkles and lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered my second bottle of eye Cream.  It works great !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old I do have a skin of a 40 years old, the best creation for skin care benefits. I highly recommended to use morning and night or all day long LOVE IT no saggy skin or wrinkles to worry about</li>
    <li> Although I cannot exactly say that this products gets rid of wrinkles since I have yet to get any, it diminished the lines under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I&#x27;ve ordered it a few times now and will stick with it because the product does what it says it will do and it is for a fair price.  For a while I was experiencing bags under my eyes and started to develop fine lines, mostly due to a busy schedule and caffeine overdose. I tried a few products including alpha hydroxy and wasn&#x27;t getting the results I desired. After reading reviews on this product I decided to give it a shot and  noticed a positive difference within about a week. I&#x27;ve made sure to apply it every morning and every evening, and when I ordered my second bottle I paired it with the VC20 Vitamin C Serum, which has also shown improvement in firming up the skin on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I cannot always afford it in my budget, but when I do splurge I definitely see and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nexgen&#x27;s products for about two years. My husband of 24 years says I look better today, at almost 43 years old, than when I was 19-20 years old. My brother told me the other day, &amp;#34;You get more beautiful as you get older.&amp;#34; His words, not mine! I rarely break out anymore, and, when I do get a pimple, It is gone overnight. It&#x27;s light and sinks in to skin quickly.</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd bottle of this product and it truly works. The lines on my forehead &amp; neck are almost gone &amp; it has even helped with the sun damage on my decollete.</li>
    <li> This is the fastest working thing I found that actually eliminate my dark spots and actually keep them away. I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t leave me with an oily or grease face.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s make this very simple..........GREAT....BUY IT!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!  I use Queen Bee eye cream for nights for my dark circles but this for the daytime.  This cream tightens up my looser skin under my eyes.  I am 46 and have not really started to wrinkle except for the loose skin under my eyes (genetics and being pregnant at a later age) and this product has made me feel like I looked when I was in my late 30&#x27;s.  You can feel it keeping the skin tight right away.  Do not add anything else to your eye area if you want to keep things tight, otherwise this is not as effective.  If you are very oily you may have to reapply early afternoon, but this is a miracle in a jar.</li>
    <li> My aunt was starting to worry about her looks and tried a few differ products and gotten no where till she found oculift. She looks 10 time better with barley a sight of bags, I think I might try it..lol</li>
    <li> Heard alot about Oculift, can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
    <li> This Oculift Serum really works! My dark circles have diminished and my skin feels tighter and more elastic. The little lines I used to see are barely even noticable. When I started using Oculift, I was sceptical, but now that I feel great looking in the mirror, seeing the real results, I have no doubt that I made the right choice. Wow, Oculift!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am a 23 year old grad student with dark circles due to late night studying, at least I was until I noticed that my friend who usually looks as tired as I do started to look like we were actually 23 again. I began sneaking to her bathroom to try her oculift and after 1 week I decided it was time to buy my own. I will be buying this product over and over again. My dark circles have lifted and I don&#x27;t look so tired anymore. Thank you Oculift</li>
    <li> This is much better than any of the loreal or obagi stuff I have tried, and cheaper!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the rapid results I received using Oculift and will certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Not only is Oculift a Doctor Recommended eye serum, but it really does reduce those dark circles and bags. I mean you can really see the difference almost immediately after you start using it, and other people will soon notice your flawless, wrinkle-free face too. This product gives you a more youthful glow. Being the night owl that I am, this serum really does come in handy. Since using Oculift, I’ve used a lot less foundation and makeup on my face to conceal what used to be bags, as a result giving my skin a much more healthier appearance and maintaining its natural tone. I also have pretty sensitive skin and so far I have not had an irritable reactions.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews before buying and should have checked out the reviewers profiles because they all seemed to reviewed the same products from NexGen Biolabs positively. I actually purchased this product and it is not good at all. Serum is thick and did nothing for my dark circles. It irritated the area around my eyes and made it puffy and red. I used it for two days and it made me look like I had less sleep than usual. I now know better and will definitely question a product with too many positive reviews. Do not buy this product! All the positive reviews are a scam.</li>
    <li> BEWARE PEOPLE! I am convinced that many of the positive reviews are fake. I was looking at reviews for baby sunscreen (Thinkbaby) and there was this link embedded in one of the reviews to this product. I was close to putting it in my shopping bag after reviewing all the amazing reviews until I started reading some one star reviews. Somebody is spending some time (and money probably) on this cheesy internet marketing techniques. Unfortunately (and fortunately for us) they are not doing so tactfully. They say money back guarantee so it may be worth the try if you are still adventurous enough to give it a try but I warn you to be careful.</li>
    <li> Anti-aging never been easier for Oculift. Quality, and quick treatment to make skin look and feel healthier and younger than ever.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from Innovex Nutrition and received it a few days ago.  The product was not sealed in any way, and it seemed to me that it had been used by someone else prior to being sent to me.  Apparently, I was correct because after using the product for only 3 days, the bottle is empty.  I cannot give a positive review in light of this situation.  VERY disappointed...waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks but I have noticed a little less darkness below my eyes as well as a softening of the fine lines.  I like this product and hope to see further improvement...then I will love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for two months for eye wrinkles (I&#x27;m 45). I have not seen one bit of difference. Product&#x27;s consistency is like hand sanitizer. We&#x27;ll see if Amazon returns it. I purchased three products from this brand and was not impressed. Highly suspicious ratings, in my opinion. Proceed with caution. Another skin product bites the dust.</li>
    <li> I like that the bottle is so big and will last a long time. I only use one little drop and it is enough ti use under both eyes. It has seemed to help with dark circles. I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference the first week so I waited to do my review and I have noticed a difference in the second week. Yes, my skin does not look orange and I use before applying my foundation. I also love that it is lightweight, not greasy and absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> I was seeing results almost right away. It has helped to get rid of all the dark circles as well as wrinkles around the eyes. Best of all, the results are long lasting so I don’t have to constantly apply it! Great stuff</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to give this a try. I used this faithfully for 6 weeks and never noticed a difference. I am very disappointed and will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> For years I have battled dark circles/ puffiness under my eyes. A few weeks ago I started using this in the mornings, and friends have commented that I look really relaxed. I figured out that this is the reason. It is very light weight and you need very little. I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product,&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a problem with puffiness around my eyes even when I was younger. As I have gotten older, the puffiness has gotten worse in addition to the annoying wrinkles that are starting to form. I have only been using this serum for a few weeks, but I can already see an improvement in my skin. The puffiness has decreased somewhat and I am starting to see a noticeable difference in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> A good choice,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only expect the results to get better each week going forward. The pump is perfect for dispensing the correct amount of serum so there is no waste. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review and opinion. I highly recommend this product if you want to improve the appearance and feel of the skin around your eyes!</li>
    <li> I am 35 and have started to see fine lines under my eyes, especially when I smile. I needed something to decrease the look of my lines and something that would not irritate my skin. I have very sensitive skin. This has almost elimated my fine lines around my eyes. I apply this every night before going to bed. I would definitly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Oculift is a great product to use to keep wrinkles from forming. I mainly use it at night, but it is good any time.</li>
    <li> I’m a college student and I do not get much sleep so I started to get a lot of dark circles. Luckily, I was recommended this and I’m super happy with the results. No more dark circles and it has left improved my skin to be brighter and very smooth!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to review this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have had a case of the &amp;#34;I am on Youtube too long and I have bags under my eyes&amp;#34; syndrome and needed a really good treatment and I have certainly found it in this anti-wrinkle serum for under eyes and was really impressed with it&#x27;s effects after a few days use, The serum is non-greasy and cooling so you can feel it&#x27;s effects. The best is when you wake up and those lines are no longer an issue. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs those lines GONE!! A really great serum.</li>
    <li> Very effective,&lt;br /&gt;This serum is a must have for tired moms. I apply it nightly followed by Oculift&#x27;s eye gel and it is very effective in fighting dark under eyes as well as puffiness. I noticed the skin under my eyes became much smoother after continued use. It is also an amazing value. You receive so much product for the price point. I would think this would last close to an entire year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for a week and have enjoyed seeing my puffy under-eyes tighten up each day. Big fan!</li>
    <li> Works well and is not greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> very good at dimishing those dark circles under your eyes I was impressed.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a bit of difference by using this product. I would recommend to going to Walmart and getting an eye cream there.</li>
    <li> My eyes look so much brighter,&lt;br /&gt;I received the eye serum and I absolutely love it! When I opened the eye serum I was quite surprised to see that the serum was a coral colored serum; perhaps because I am used to seeing opaque colored serums. The serum smelled citrusy and went on evenly when applied against my face. The consistency of the eye serum is quite thick. It will not run off the dropper and the dropper has to be squeezed to get the amount you want onto your face. The quality of the eye serum is really superb and I cannot rave enough about it. My eyes look so much brighter, alive and awake because of this stuff!</li>

    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it--something that acutally does what it says!</li>
    <li> I like this product.I have tried lots of products that cost much more &amp; this works just as well.</li>
    <li> First time using this product and I love it.</li>
    <li> As an allergy sufferer, prone to the dark allergy under eye circles, I have tried countless eye products that did nothing. This one really works! I saw instant results and putting it on before bed kept the puffy eyes at bay in the morning. Great product.</li>
    <li> It doesn’t seem to creep up into your eyes as some other eye products do. And so my eyes don’t get teary and it gives me an instant smooth look.</li>
    <li> Truly this product makes a difference in my eye appearance. Keeping your eyes looking young can be a challenge, but this product gives me a more youthful appearance. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I have noticed lately the saggy baggy look from my eyes. Using rehydrating creams would help, but the skin would reduce and the skin was &amp;#34;layered&amp;#34; and very thin and looked baggy... YIKES! A tiny little dab of the Oculift eye serum helps that reduction to happen in a gentle way that the skin layers are still cohesive and not baggy. I could not live without this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this a few times at night and each time that I&#x27;ve applied it as recommended, I would feel a burning sensation along with a tightening feeling around my eyes and I would break out. I&#x27;m returning this product. I&#x27;m so glad my purchase went through Amazon Prime. Their customer service never fails to impress me and they issued a refund immediately.</li>
    <li> I received the eye serum and I absolutely love it! When I opened the eye serum I was quite surprised to see that the serum was a coral colored serum; perhaps because I am used to seeing opaque colored serums. The serum smelled citrusy and went on evenly when applied against my face. The consistency of the eye serum is quite thick. It will not run off the dropper and the dropper has to be squeezed to get the amount you want onto your face. The quality of the eye serum is really superb and I cannot rave enough about it. My eyes look so much brighter, alive and awake because of this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since November 2013. My eye area not only feels supple but the delicate skin smoothed out and doesn&#x27;t look wrinkled I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I love Oculift eye serum. I&#x27;ve tried many brands! It completely delivered on its promise of reducing the fine lines and hydrating skin from my very first use. I just love it!</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this is the best eye serum I have ever used...seriously. I have tried so many creams and serums that promise what this product does, but this one actually works. Dark circles and puffiness were my main concerns. I look tired sometimes because of them, so I always wear makeup which I hate doing every time I leave the house. I had been using the product for around two weeks just as directed, and one day I was looking in mirror and noticed that the darkness and puffiness under my eyes were gone. I looked closer and thought...wait, did I put makeup on? No, I had bare skin and no puffy eyes or dark circles! I thought it would take much longer to see results if it worked at all, but nope. About 2 weeks. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Did not live up to its glowing reviews. Made my eyes have more lines if anything! Also could not use it under makeup. Did not allow eyeshadow to glide on.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes under my eye look and feel. I&#x27;m so grateful to have found this Nexgen eye serum, my skin has never felt and looked so good!!&lt;br /&gt;WOW!!!! WHAT A PRODUCT...&lt;br /&gt;It reduces puffiness within half an hour, absorbs right into my skin without making my eyes burn, and has permanently removed two wrinkles on the outer side below my eye, that&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a year now. Goes on easily and is a good foundation base to use around eyes.</li>
    <li> After a short time using this, I found the skin around my eyes to be tighter w/crows&#x27; feet less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin (&amp; like compounds) is a primarily ingredient of Oculift.  Since glycerin, a known emollient/moisturizer, is known to drawn moisture to the top skin layer, it makes sense that my skin has plumped a bit &amp; thus my wrinkles seem less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a chemist but do expect that I&#x27;d lose any positive results if I stopped applying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers need to be aware that the manufacturer practices good customer service by asking that users contact them w/a problem rather than posting negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, positive reviews are strongly encouraged since once reviewed buyers submit proof of a review, they are supposedly eligible to receive a free bottle of this product.  The promise of free product may contaminate/inflate our reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review after several weeks of use.  I plan to also try plain old glycerin - &amp; add some alpha hydroxy acid &amp; vitamin C - to see if this achieves the same temporary, positive cosmetic effect.  If you&#x27;re curious about the key ingredients, e.g., glycerin, here&#x27;s a trustworthy website to start learning more:  http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-20275/glycerin-top/details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Delivery was late due to weather conditions beyond the vendor&#x27;s control.)</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing. I was very hesitant about spending the money on this serum, but it has lasted me literally 7 months. It requires one pump for the entire face, when touched in 4 quadrants. My skin is never dry or dull. Makeup goes on very nicely when also used with the moisturizer. This is a product that I will continue to use. Love it!</li>
    <li> I did not see any result on me ,</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about three weeks and it has made my face so glowing and bright . I had lots of dark spot on my face and it helps a lot to clear it</li>
    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t see any difference !</li>
    <li> Finally, face protection that is much needed! Living in the Colorado Mountains can dry you up in a hurry. A face here can use extra protection. Oculift is a must, it will be used every day. Five stars*</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know my makeup could go on so smooth. I always bought moisturizer at the drugstore--never again! Oculift is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> GREAT, GREAT STUFF WILL DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
    <li> Been using for about a week. Not sure if I notice results... update again later</li>
    <li> This serum works wonders! Its non oily and absorbs quickly. It can be used on any type of skin and it&#x27;ll give you immediate results. It&#x27;s very hard to find a firming product that works this quickly. Overnight you can see a difference in facial contours. It doesn&#x27;t really brighten from what I&#x27;ve seen but it does lift &amp; firm. It works great with smoothing out wrinkles too!</li>
    <li> I could feel the burn when I first applied this restoring serum, which means that it was getting rid of all the impurities under the eye. As promised, I saw results within the hour and was satisfied as it minimized the appearance of my dark circles. The serum does not leave any greasy film and gives a &amp;#34;near-naked&amp;#34; feeling a few minutes after use. All you need is one small squirt for both eyes so the bottle will last you a long time and is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I bought this that it would work since I had tried a variety of other products with no changes. After using it for only three weeks, mornings only, my upper lip has plumped up which has eliminated almost all the tiny lines. I have to pucker my lips to see any. A friend whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in months ran into me the other day and complimented me on my complexion.</li>
    <li> I think I might be seeing some improvement in the fine lines around my eyes when using this in combination with the eye cream. However, I&#x27;m not sure about the rest of my face. I have been using the product for about three weeks or so. I think I will use it a bit longer before I say anything definitive.</li>
    <li> I got a sample from Nexgen and bought a full-sized bottle almost immediately after trying it. I don&#x27;t often get too excited over skincare products, but not even the price can keep me from this stuff. My face felt firmer and silkier instantly! My skin just feels healthy now.</li>
    <li> Great buy, it lasts a long time and you will see a noticeable difference in your skin tone within days.</li>
    <li> Within the first week I started getting compliments and asked what I was doing differently.</li>
    <li> This my second bottle of Oculift Serum. My skin is healthy, smooth and barely showing lines considering my age!</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend. I have not been disappointed. The texture of my skin has improved and overall it feels firmer.</li>
    <li> This serum makes my skin beautiful day and night. My new must have product.</li>
    <li> I used to have dark circle, after using this product I don&#x27;t have dark circle anymore. This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I fell for it! These reviews are fake! I just received my product. Although I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, it burned the fragile skin around my eyes. So I went back to read more about the product. As you read all the reviews, you realize how contrived they all sound. And the dates are all within the same week or so. It may be a decent product, but I feel fooled!!</li>
    <li> Seriously good results in less than 2 weeks. No scent, not oily, easy to apply, comforting. Love this product. Dark circles are going away fast as is the puffyness under my eyes. I almost can&#x27;t believe it. After reading a review on Amazon I tried this product and am very surprised with the quick results. I use this product 2 times a day as recommended.</li>
    <li> i couldnt use regularly so i don&#x27;t know how it works. it is light and not greasy..</li>
    <li> Oculift is GREAT. The morning after I used this for the first time the skin around my eyes felt plump yet firm, soft, supple, rested. Over time, with use at night and day, this product seems to be keeping my dark under eye circles from forming. This absorbs quickly and my mascara doesn&#x27;t run when i use it.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom to try and she loved it. She is a 56 year old women that has tried so many creams and serums.. she said she loved it and she was very happy with the results</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily for close to a month now, and I can notice the results. It has certainly helped with my dark under eye area problems. It has lightened then some, and reduced puffiness. When using the serum, I can instantly feel the tightening, and my eyes feel more alive and awake! The serum is a beautiful bright orange color, which absorbs instantly into my skin. The eye serum is a bit thinner than other serums, and it only takes the smallest drop that you can dispense, when I used more my skin felt kind of tacky. A little goes a long way with this one. Oh, and the citrus smell is uplifting, I really enjoy that aspect.</li>
    <li> I’d highly recommend this if you want to get rid of all the fine lines and dark circles FAST. I also noticed that my skin has gotten a lot softer and shiny! There were no irritation and side-effects as well as no oily skin!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Oculift skin care line and I have tried quite a bit of their products. I am happy to announce that most of them are part of my day and night skin care routine. One product like this, that I enjoy using every morning and night is Oculift Eye Serum. I already have tons of face serums, but I have never had my hands on an eye serum before.</li>
    <li> Good product,&lt;br /&gt;This did a great job of getting rid of my dark circles and puffiness under my eyes! And you can really smell the Vitamin C. It makes me feel good to use a product that doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful parabens, sulfates or alcohol. I was provided this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> The Oculift Eye Serum is super easy to apply. Simply apply a small amount to your fingertips &amp; gently press in a rolling motion, under each eye - starting at the inner corner &amp; ending at the outer corner. That&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> The dispenser makes it easy to use without wasting any product, and that&#x27;s good. I am 65, so I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but I do think my eyes look good since I started using this. My eye area definitely does not look as lined as before I started to use it. I would recommend it for older skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get a lot of sleep so I really love how this product helps me reduce the look of being extremely tired all the time! It is the best one I have tried for reducing my under eye circles.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product and have had astounding results that have been noticed by people that I haven&#x27;t seen for some time and have been asked what I am doing because I look so much younger.  I love the cool feeling when I use it and I have keep checking in the mirror because I can see amazing results.  Anyone looking for help with dark circles and under eye puffiness should try this and I am sure they will be happy and amazed.</li>
    <li> It makes an immediate visible difference. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is perfect under makeup in the morning. It&#x27;s cool and refreshing. I&#x27;ve noticed some softening of the fine lines around my eyes in just a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I got my sexy eyes back just after a few days of using it.</li>
    <li> Oculift works very well and quickly. I am not using concealer anymore which is unbelievable for me. Try this product!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it first came out and love it. I am definitely less wrinkled than my friends who don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This serum does everything it says it does and absorbs quickly into the skin. Exfoliation is the key to any sort of serum or moisturizer and the results you get from it.</li>
