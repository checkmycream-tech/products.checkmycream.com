      <li>Love this hairspray and have been using it for awhile.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite hairspray.</li>
      <li>Shaper has been my favorite hair spray for decades.</li>
      <li>and I just love them.</li>
      <li>I always love this hairspray, but one of the three cans will not spray---what do do?</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
      <li>But my wife likes it better.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to finish a can without breakage.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this hair spray for many years and would not change it for anything else.</li>
      <li>But even though it brushes out easily and doesn&#x27;t build up, it does hold well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold.  </li>
      <li>the smell isn&#x27;t strong</li>
      <li>It shampoos out beautifully even after 2-3 days of daily use.</li>
      <li>Hairspray works fine.</li>
      <li>i love sebastian products and especially shaper, this is a great hair spray because it holds well and smells nice but is not hard or sticky</li>
      <li>It is a light and touchable hold that lasts my hair all day.  </li>
      <li>As with any aerosol hair spray, rinse the nozzle in hot water and wipe dry after each use to ensure the best spray density.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with everything, thanks!</li>
      <li>I have tried other professional products and I find that Sebastian works best for me.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>I love that it goes on &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and that I can brush through it easily and restyle my hair if necessary.</li>
      <li>I suggested it to a friend who has the same kind of hair.</li>
      <li>Item is exactly as described, and arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend the regular Sebastian Shaper Hairspray, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
      <li>Goog price and received very fast.</li>
      <li>Excellent, light spray for fine or thin hair; does not weigh down the hair.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what my wife wanted at a competitive price.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I have tried so many others and always go back to this</li>
      <li>first time my hairdresser put it on my hair, 4 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s really not as expensive as you might think.</li>
      <li>this is a terrific hairspray that I have used for a long time and will continue to use because it is great at holding the hair and just brushes out.  </li>
      <li>The hold is good, but not sticky and the smell is not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>This hairspray really holds my curls, no matter what the weather.</li>
      <li>It really does not hold.  </li>
      <li>It is far better than I expected</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Because I have long hair, I don&#x27;t shampoo it daily, so I also love that there is no hairspray build-up with Shaper.</li>
      <li>love the small diameter cans</li>
      <li>I found this seller, because the price with free shipping is significantly less than I would pay anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>Used once in the morning, this spray doesn&#x27;t get sticky, isn&#x27;t too stiff, just gives the hair some hold and combs out easily, but helps the hair maintain its shape.  </li>
      <li>Not stiff or sticky but holds.</li>
      <li>It just keeps your hair in shape in a soft and natural way.</li>
      <li>It is not heavy nor sticky.</li>
      <li>It leaves the hair looking natural, softer and lasts without stiffness.</li>
      <li>I have fine but thick hair, and live in south Florida with a lot of humidity.  </li>
      <li>This hair spray and the extra hold (which is too heavy for fine hair) are packaged almost identically, so check the description or label carefully.  </li>

    <li> This is the best hair spray I ever tried. I&#x27;d try hundreds before but they don&#x27;t work...leave my hair a mess.</li>
    <li> Yes I like it.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine/thin hair and yet keeps the style without getting sticky and stiff.  I suggested it to a friend who has the same kind of hair.</li>
    <li> I love Sebastian Shaper! The regular - not the Shaper Plus. I&#x27;ve been using this for over 20 years and it&#x27;s the one hairspray that I cannot be without. I love that it goes on &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and that I can brush through it easily and restyle my hair if necessary. Because I have long hair, I don&#x27;t shampoo it daily, so I also love that there is no hairspray build-up with Shaper. It shampoos out beautifully even after 2-3 days of daily use. But even though it brushes out easily and doesn&#x27;t build up, it does hold well. Best. Hairspray. Ever.</li>

    <li> Goog price and received very fast. This is my favorite hairspray. It is not sticky and holds my hairstyle well</li>
    <li> Shaper has been my favorite hair spray for decades. You can work with it. It is not heavy nor sticky.</li>
    <li> perfect and quick and easy--thank you</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended it.  It really does not hold.  It could be that I am not using enough.  On a 5-star rating, it is not sticky.</li>

    <li> The best AND right to my doorstep. Love PRIME!</li>
    <li> constantly reorder so that says alot..........happy with product</li>
    <li> finally found the &amp;#34;original formula&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Hairspray works fine.</li>
    <li> Great product , it&#x27;s a must have</li>
    <li> Love the shaper spray..hold&#x27;s great and the smell isn&#x27;t strong</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Have used for year.s</li>
    <li> This hairspray really holds my curls, no matter what the weather. The hold is good, but not sticky and the smell is not overwhelming. This is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  It smells very nice - but not an overwhelming scent.  It is a light and touchable hold that lasts my hair all day.  It&#x27;s the only hairspray I use.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my wife wanted at a competitive price.</li>
    <li> great price. this is the only hairspray I use. I have tried so many others and always go back to this</li>
    <li> this is a terrific hairspray that I have used for a long time and will continue to use because it is great at holding the hair and just brushes out.  There is never any sticky or hard feeling using this spray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and like it a great deal.  Before deciding to look online, I bought this from the beauty/barber shops; but they are much more expensive there.  My hair is very fine and this spray allows me to spray it on and then style it.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold.  It just allows you to spray and style.  You would need the Shaper Plus for a stronger hold.</li>
    <li> Product is great. Spray can is horrible. Lost pressure in can and can not use half if the product. Contacted seller and have not heard back yet.</li>
    <li> While I absolutely adore this hairspray, hate the defective nozzles.  Haven&#x27;t been able to finish a can without breakage.  Sebastian needs to fix this so I can quit wasting my money on half-empty cans.  Using L&#x27;Oreal Elnet until that happens.</li>
    <li> Love this holding spray! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff.</li>
    <li> But my wife likes it better.</li>
    <li> It is a very light hair spray.  Holds your hair in place but does not look or feel stiff. Great for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Sebastian products since the late 80&#x27;s and I just love them. I have tried other professional products and I find that Sebastian works best for me.</li>
    <li> i love sebastian products and especially shaper, this is a great hair spray because it holds well and smells nice but is not hard or sticky</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair spray for years and like it. Thank you for good service</li>
    <li> love the small diameter cans</li>
    <li> I love Shaper!  It&#x27;s the best hairspray ever!!</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as described, and arrived quickly.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> met every expectation</li>
    <li> This hairspray is very light but holds well. I cant stand the smell though</li>
    <li> Superb product!&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian is wonderful.  I also use Sebastian&#x27;s Laminates Conditioner which is the best conditioner on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;I can spray my hair and it doesn&#x27;t take the shine out of my hair and has no residue.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended to me by someone at work.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product! Doesn&#x27;t leave over any residue like some haisprays do.</li>
    <li> No hold, not happy at all with this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter &amp; granddaughters love Sebastian Shaper Hairspray! It brushes out easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t clog their hair! Have a wonderfully blessed 2015!</li>
