      <li>I got the lotion as a gift &amp; just love the smell of it</li>
      <li>I Love The Smell &amp; It</li>
      <li>Love Bath &amp; Body Works Products.......</li>
      <li>so I just had to have this Fragrance mist to go with it :)</li>
      <li>Use often..light and refreshing</li>
      <li>fragrance itself is...not my favorite.</li>
      <li>I use it every day. :)</li>
      <li>My favorite body mist was discontinued</li>
      <li>My husband told me this was his favorite smell.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this......</li>
      <li>I love the fresh scent, and get so many compliments on it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS FINE FRAGRANCE</li>
      <li>Now, I have to make sure I don&#x27;t spray too much because it can be so overwhelming!</li>
      <li>when i purchase the full size i have to grab a couple of the travel size to have with me , so glad i can find it on amazon.</li>
      <li>Love the fresh clean scent!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this scent , i first purchased it at bath and body works and fell in love</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real thing, which is nice.</li>
      <li>The Cherry Blossom is a light scent that reminds me of baby powder and cleanliness.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re testing different scents, this is a great price for a ton of fragrance.</li>
      <li>As long as she loves it, then I&#x27;m happy as well too.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this for a Christmas gift.  </li>
      <li>Was as described, packed nicely and brand new in the bottle.</li>
      <li>It quickly has become my new favorite perfume!</li>
      <li>It is light yet very pretty.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent is rose and the Japanese cherry blossom scent is very similar---maybe even better.</li>
      <li>I knew it was the last straw when my husband, who also loved the scent, walked into the room right after I&#x27;d sprayed it and said with a wince, covering his nose, &amp;#34;Wow babe!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was kind of ecstatic to learn that Bath &amp; Body Works products were on Amazon in the first place, so I half-expected them to be some watered-down knock-off version of the real thing when they arrived (that happened to me once when I ordered Crew shampoo online).</li>
      <li>Not as sweet as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>I love the new look!</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance in this new packaging.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no longer the light, freshly showered, barely there fragrance that I fell in love with.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend love this fragrant like wow!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such an amazing smell.</li>
      <li>I apologized to others if my smell was over powering in some way, because I didn&#x27;t want to be that lady who walked by and filled the room with too much smell.</li>
      <li>Maybe it would have been when I was in college or fresh out of school.</li>
      <li>Even the perfume I use right up.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more from this seller in the future.</li>
      <li>I will be sure to order again at a later date.</li>
      <li>I first stumbled across this fragrance at one of the Bath and Body Work store.</li>
      <li>When it arrived it was exactly as advertised</li>
      <li>I understand that it is a matter of personal preference and that what I do not like may very well be someone else&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this same product for years, and it&#x27;s my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>she couldn&#x27;t remember Japanese only cherry blossom and told me she loved it, therefore i did some research and found it,  </li>
      <li>I love this fragrance, so I&#x27;m happy, but it isn&#x27;t as long lasting as some of the other Bath and Body Works fragrances I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>The scent is still beautiful from the last time I received it few years ago as a gift.</li>
      <li>However, after watching a Bethany Mota YouTube video in which she (a popular 17-year old girl) has two of her guy friends smell her fragrances and rate them, I decided I didn&#x27;t have enough variety in my fragrance collection and needed a new</li>
      <li>Very &amp;#34;grown&amp;#34; up smelling.</li>
      <li>I love B&amp;BW products, but I really do not care for this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am very grateful that it came on time too</li>
      <li>I received my order fast.</li>
      <li>However, this is the real thing...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll purchase more in the near future.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For me it&#x27;s the perfect scent. I get lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Smells good and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this fragrance and she was so very happy to get it as a christmas present. I received it in a short amount of time and was just what I expected</li>
    <li> Love the scent and shipping was fast, not happy with the sprayer, it fell off after 4 uses and would not stay back on</li>
    <li> Product is great. Shipping&#x27;s a little steep but capitalism marches on.</li>
    <li> Soft and gentle scent.  I spray it on my hair after I shower and sometimes spray it on my pillow before I go to sleep.</li>
    <li> Very &amp;#34;grown&amp;#34; up smelling. Not as sweet as I thought it would be. Smells like a flowery grandma.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much !!!</li>
    <li> I got the lotion as a gift &amp; just love the smell of it so I just had to have this Fragrance mist to go with it :)</li>
    <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT....IT IS EXCELLENT</li>
    <li> My girlfriend love this fragrant like wow! As long as she loves it, then I&#x27;m happy as well too. I&#x27;ll purchase more in the near future.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS FINE FRAGRANCE IT IS THE BEST IT HAS A WONDERFUL SMELL. YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG BUYING THIS I PROMISE</li>
    <li> My husband told me this was his favorite smell. So I bought this on Amazon and we are both thoroughly satisfied with it! I use it every day. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a grown adult and a mother. However, after watching a Bethany Mota YouTube video in which she (a popular 17-year old girl) has two of her guy friends smell her fragrances and rate them, I decided I didn&#x27;t have enough variety in my fragrance collection and needed a new scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boys in Bethany&#x27;s video rated the Bath &amp; Body Works Japanese Cherry Blossom scent as one of their favorites from her collection, so I decided to order some and start using it. What can I say, my husband works nights sometimes and I spend a lot of time hanging out on the internets watching things and buying things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of ecstatic to learn that Bath &amp; Body Works products were on Amazon in the first place, so I half-expected them to be some watered-down knock-off version of the real thing when they arrived (that happened to me once when I ordered Crew shampoo online). However, this is the real thing...I compared the scent to a little sample-size Cherry Blossom lotion I already had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance itself is...not my favorite. Maybe it would have been when I was in college or fresh out of school. However, I&#x27;m more of a Chance by Chanel kind of person these days...I just like those richer scents that stay on you all day and stick to the fibers of your clothing so that when you walk in the closet, it just smells so delicious. The Cherry Blossom is a light scent that reminds me of baby powder and cleanliness. It lasts for a few hours and I cannot smell it in my clothes after I change...or the next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re testing different scents, this is a great price for a ton of fragrance. It&#x27;s the real thing, which is nice. I&#x27;ll probably end up giving it to my sister.</li>
    <li> The scent is still beautiful from the last time I received it few years ago as a gift. I was so happy that I was able to find it on Amazon at a great price. I received my order fast. This is a wonderful birthday present to myself. I will be buying more from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> I like the smell but doesn&#x27;t last long and its not as strong as I hoped for overall a okay body spray</li>
    <li> AS I saide before I like it very much and would give as a gife, and the smell is great</li>
    <li> i bought this for a friend as a Christmas gift.  she couldn&#x27;t remember Japanese only cherry blossom and told me she loved it, therefore i did some research and found it,  she was thrilled.  thank you.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing. I was kind of leery buying perfume online and not being able to smell it but this is a good choice if you are going to buy one. Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance in this new packaging. It is just what I was hoping for and use it daily. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I love B&amp;BW products, but I really do not care for this fragrance. I understand that it is a matter of personal preference and that what I do not like may very well be someone else&#x27;s favorite. With that being said this specific fragrance also seems to wear off quicker than some of the other fragrances from Bath &amp; Body Works that I have. I&#x27;m not sure why that would be; however, that is the main reason for the two star review.</li>
    <li> I usually go to the store and purchase this, but I found it on here for cheaper. I love the new look! I&#x27;ve bought this same product for years, and it&#x27;s my absolute favorite. I&#x27;m only 26 so finding something that doesn&#x27;t smell like a 5 year olds cotton candy scent, or an older ladys perfume sometimes is hard. Not with this though! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Love this product, it came perfect.</li>
    <li> it looks and smells awesome thank you and would recommend to friends and family. I am very grateful that it came on time too</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this......it&#x27;s the best....not overpowering.........and I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments about it.  The price was much better also!</li>
    <li> very good product..love it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents! I got it here for a few dollars cheaper than if I went to the store! Love it for a casual scent.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for a Christmas gift.  She loves this scent but I did not want to have to go all the way to the local mall across town during the holidays.  When I found this on Amazon I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  When it arrived it was exactly as advertised and she loved it!</li>
    <li> This is no reflection on the seller, because the product came promptly and there were absolutely no problems with shipping. But there seems to be a change in the aroma or smell of this fragrance! I had Japanese Cherry Blossom about 3 years ago and couldn&#x27;t get enough of the fresh, clean scent. Now that they&#x27;ve changed the bottle, the fragrance seems to have undergone some sort of fragrant, perfume-y, intolerable change as well. It&#x27;s no longer the light, freshly showered, barely there fragrance that I fell in love with. Now, I have to make sure I don&#x27;t spray too much because it can be so overwhelming! I knew it was the last straw when my husband, who also loved the scent, walked into the room right after I&#x27;d sprayed it and said with a wince, covering his nose, &amp;#34;Wow babe! What in the world IS that?!&amp;#34; Yyyyyyep. Definitely not the same scent I had a few years ago.</li>
    <li> I got this mist and to my disappointment it did not smell like the original. Smells like rubbing alchol. I read some where tha they changed up, i hate don&#x27;t buy this crap</li>
    <li> One of the best scents on the market.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, so I&#x27;m happy, but it isn&#x27;t as long lasting as some of the other Bath and Body Works fragrances I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Was as described, packed nicely and brand new in the bottle. Just as good as from the store without going to the store.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!! Love it!! Quick delivery!!</li>
    <li> The stuff is absolutely amazing my lady friends absolutely love it and so do I</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this one because I ordered another body wash and not this one, but you sended to me another one. I will keep this one but I can not order that body wash what my wifes like</li>
    <li> The fragrance smells wonderful and at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;Scent lasts long on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love Bath &amp; Body Works Products.......I Love The Smell &amp; It Lingers For A Long Time, A Very Satisfied Customer &amp; Will Definitely Order Again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, it has always been a favorite. The package arrived before time and I appreciate your services. Thank you! 😃</li>
    <li> Love this spray...and everyone else around me loves it as well!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t even give this to my wife, it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectation..</li>
    <li> My mother loves it. I don&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m a guy who is 23 years old with bad taste, so...</li>
    <li> I do like the smell of this product, its not one i can use everyday because the scent doesnt last long, which i can say is the only downfall.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that no complains here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes i would recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> My daughter wears this fragrance and I just had to buy one for myself. It is light yet very pretty. I have expensive colognes but I just love the aroma of this product. Great value too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and transaction</li>
    <li> Was a christmas gift.  My niece luvs the way it smells.  I would definitely purchase other items with this scent.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh clean scent!</li>
    <li> My favorite body mist was discontinued so I branched out looking for candidates to take its place. This body mist was okay but very strong. I kept smelling myself throughout the day and wondering how far that cloud extended. I apologized to others if my smell was over powering in some way, because I didn&#x27;t want to be that lady who walked by and filled the room with too much smell. My co-workers reassured me that I wasn&#x27;t doing that. Maybe I was using too much, so I tried it again with much less applied. I still could smell myself all day and I still felt like I had a cloud. If people like the smell, maybe it&#x27;s a great buy. I felt I smelled like an old ladies house.</li>
    <li> Use often..light and refreshing</li>
    <li> It is just what I ordered. I will be sure to order again at a later date. I love this fragrence.</li>
    <li> My complaint is I go through this stuff like crazy! Even the perfume I use right up. It&#x27;s such an amazing smell. My favorite scent is rose and the Japanese cherry blossom scent is very similar---maybe even better.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh scent, and get so many compliments on it! It quickly has become my new favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents. Received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> excelent produts an service</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent.  I first stumbled across this fragrance at one of the Bath and Body Work store. This is a great for anyone whom may like exocite scents.  Give this a try.</li>
