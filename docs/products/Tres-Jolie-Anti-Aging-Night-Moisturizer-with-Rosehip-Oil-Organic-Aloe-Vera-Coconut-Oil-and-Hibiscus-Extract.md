    <li> Love this night cream, it goes on creamy and really leaves the skin feeling smooth. The most important factor to me is the run up of superb natural ingredients, all of them providing good nutrients for your skin. And a 4 ounce jar at this price is for sure a great deal!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream!.. Leaves my skin moisturized without being greasy.  I seem to be always trying to find a cream that gives me what I need and finally my search is over. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I don’t usually like moisturizers that are to be worn at night. They are too heavy &amp; make my face feel greasy. Not this one! I’d been looking for a great nighttime moisturizer when I was given the opportunity to test &amp; review this Nighttime Face Cream. And I’m so glad that I found it. It’s exactly what I was hoping to find!&lt;br /&gt;This cream comes packaged in a red satin drawstring bag. So pretty! And this large size jar will last a while because the cream smoothes on so smoothly that it doesn’t take a lot to cover my face, neck &amp; hands. It doesn’t have a scent, which I like because I don’t want to smell anything on my face when I’m trying to go to sleep. And when I wake up, my skin feels hydrated instead of dry.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is perfect for my skin as I’m trying to push back those little signs of aging. I’ve recommended it to my friends &amp; family who are looking for a great nighttime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This night cream really worked well for me. After using it for a short time I seen a major difference in my skin each day.</li>
    <li> Ok the first thing you notice about this is how beautifully it is packaged and how nice the jar looks. The niceness of this product stop there!&lt;br /&gt;* The smell is not something I would want to use on my face let alone have to sleep with. It is a like the smell of a dusty old box that has been sitting in your grandmothers attic for years. Yuck is all I can say&lt;br /&gt;* Next we have the texture. It is greasy on your face and makes your fingers feel sticky, kind of like a lollipop that has touched a child&#x27;s fingers or the feel of melted ice cream that had the misfortune to drip on your skin and dry.&lt;br /&gt;* Made my face feel so sticky and gross I immediately went and washed it off.&lt;br /&gt;I would never use this again and I wish I had never tried it. I&#x27;m sure there is some out there that would find this amazing but I&#x27;m not one of those people.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I got this free in exchange for my review or I would be on the fast track of returning it.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and love how this cream keeps my face moisturized without looking oily! Very light, pleasant smell as well.</li>
    <li> Loved the cream. It keeps my face well hydrated and moisturized throughout the whole night. I wake up feeling fresh and not dry. It is very soft and perfect for using every night.</li>
    <li> I got this night time cream as a gift for my mother. I really appreciated that it came in a beautiful red bag as I didn’t even need to pack it as a gift for her. The jar itself looks expensive and together they make a wonderful gift for every occasion. My mom really enjoys this product and she said it’s rich and moisturizing and doesn’t leave any oily residue. It makes her face and neck soft and smooth. She will be using this cream every night. I received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes and I highly recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> I have to say this product is far beyond my expectation. First, the packaging looks very luxury with a nice red satin silky fabric bag. The cream smells amazing. My skin really falls in love with this cream. I love natural and organic skin care because I do not want to put any harmful chemicals on my face. This product is trully amazing.

    <li> I;ve been using tres jolie for several weeks now and I&#x27;m really impressed by the noticeable results in my skin. I have sensitive and pale skin and so blemishes and wrinkles show really easily. I&#x27;ve noticed that some of the lines have begun to fades and also I&#x27;ve been breaking out less after using this cream nightly. I&#x27;d recommend this product for any age group or gender. It does a great job hydrating skin and slowing down signs of physical age!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! Light and not greasy. A little goes a long way, too. I use it during the day under my make-up.</li>
    <li> This cream by Tres Jolie arrives on your doorstep in a fabulous red satin drawstring bag.  It is a soft and luxurious cream that feels so smooth when you apply to your skin.  It absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky.  It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to me which is perfect.  I suffer from migraines and skin sensitivity issues that are sometimes caused by different fragrances.  I love the list of ingredients.  It has: Rose hip Oil, Hibiscus, Aloe Vera, and coconut.  This cream is also made in the USA which is always important.  I  highly recommend this cream.  I was provided a sample for free  to test and review. That in no way influences my review.</li>
    <li> With Organic Aloe Vera, Coconut Oil, Rosehip Oil, and an array of Vitamins, Tres Jolie Anti Aging Face Cream is a great all natural anti-aging night cream.  It moisturizes while it fights wrinkles, sagging skin, and other signs of aging.  It works to increase skin&#x27;s elasticity and firmness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tres Jolie should be applied in the evening before bed.  Massage it into your face and neck in upward motions. It will work while you sleep, and leave your skin soft and moisturized come the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that Tres Jolie Anti Aging Face Cream comes in a luxurious maroon drawstring bag. It would be the perfect presentation for a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discount in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best night face creams that I have tried before. It goes on smooth without making your face feel greasy. A little bit goes really a long way. I give this product a five star rating.</li>
    <li> WOW! The Tres Jolie arrived in a pretty red velvety drawstring sack and I almost didn&#x27;t want to remove it from the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients alone sold me! These are all my favorite and the things they can do alone...and knowing they are all working together for the Tres Jolie Moisturizing Cream is AH MAZ ING!! This cream is such a great product. I use it at night since I&#x27;ve gotten it 4 days ago and the results are phenomenal. I can immediately feel my skin absorbing the cream leaving no signs of oiliness to the skin and the morning I wake up it still feels smooth. I will post pictures after 14 days of using the product. I use a dime size of cream and just spread all over my face by dabbing. If you rub it together on your fingers you will notice that you won&#x27;t be able to spread evenly and then you&#x27;ll have to dip back into the jar. Just remember a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I was really excited  when I opened the package  and saw a beautiful burgandy satin pull string bag. This Creme is full of wonderful Organic materials,Organic Hibiscuc Extract,Organic Aloe Vera Juice,Rosehip Oil,Organic Coconut Oil all of these together make for a wonderful creme.I use it everyday in the morning and at night before bed and leaves my skin  smooth and feels soft and refreshed. It is non- greasy and leave the skin soft and well moisturized.I have been using it for two weeks now and  I can feel my skin tighting up and I can see it working my fine lines and wrinkles are starting to decrease daily.I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a very good nighttime face creme. It is naturally exfoliates the skin,a very good anti aging cream and no fragrance that can damage the skin.I received this at a discounted rate for my honest opinion.</li>
