### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect size</li>
      <li>it works great</li>
      <li>Great bag.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s the perfect size for two people who want to travel light but still have to pack toiletries and medicines for a week or two away.</li>
      <li>It arrived in good condition and on schedule.</li>
      <li>With the exception of the plastic hook that the bag hangs from, everything is made of good quality.  </li>
      <li>But I got it for my husband who used it this weekend on a business trip and said it was perfect - very convenient.</li>
      <li>The thing is, you can&#x27;t hang it while closing it up because the hook is at the top of the flap and goes in side.  </li>
      <li>Fully loaded mine doesn&#x27;t take up any more space than a light sweater.</li>
      <li>For the price, I guess this is a fine travel case.  </li>
      <li>The compartments are great, but the front wall is way too low</li>
      <li>and I got it super quick.  </li>
      <li>On either side of the main compartment is a small pocket which perfectly holds a full size toothbrush holder, or a 7-day pill box.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what my boyfriend needed for his shifts at the Firehouse!</li>
      <li>exactly what is listed online!</li>
      <li>My husband works on an oil plattform and this toiletry kit is perfect for him to keep all his toiletries in while showering and allows him to hang it back up in his locker so he doesn&#x27;t clutter up the bathroom for his other co-workers.</li>
      <li>Very useful product, quality design and materials, plenty of space and extra exterior pockets, great for taking on trips or even just for everyday use at home to keep hanging in your bathroom.</li>
      <li>In addition to that, you can get a full size brush and comb across the bottom of the main compartment, if you haven&#x27;t put too much stuff in it already.</li>
      <li>I was able to fit a medium sized bottle of lotion, a can of shaving gel (edge) toothbrush, toothpaste, a razor, small electric trimmer,</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and</li>
      <li>I bought this for overseas travel, as I needed something really compact for the new restrictions, yet organizable to hold all our stuff.</li>
      <li>Its kind of hard to do with out spilling out the contents of the bag.  </li>
      <li>Also, the middle pocket/partition in the main big compartment does not connect to the bottom and things go underneath and to the front, only to then fall out.</li>
      <li>I had ordered one of these a few years ago and had trouble finding it, love it</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s not too big and not too small. I was able to fit a medium sized bottle of lotion, a can of shaving gel (edge) toothbrush, toothpaste, a razor, small electric trimmer, approximately 30 q-tips in there without any problems.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my boyfriend needed for his shifts at the Firehouse! Fast shipping and exactly what is listed online!</li>
    <li> It comes as describle in the ad, but when I had it with me, I see that the opening of the lid is a little uncomfortable, also has a reinforced bottom prevents easily accommodate in small suitcases. It arrived in good condition and on schedule.</li>
    <li> With the exception of the plastic hook that the bag hangs from, everything is made of good quality.  I see that plastic hook snapping one of these days.  Only time will tell how long it will last but for now it works.  I don&#x27;t like how the zipper zipps from the back towards the front and then down the middle.  Its kind of hard to do with out spilling out the contents of the bag.  I mean, you can put some of the stuff in the net/elastic pockets but they aren&#x27;t large enough for my larger items.  The material is flimsy and not reinforced which makes it a two hand job.  I don&#x27;t like to put my bag down on the sink because the sink I use is a community sink.  I prefer to keep the cross contamination to a minimum.  Not that I&#x27;m a germaphobe, just not a big fan of other people&#x27;s spit hence the reason I picked a hanging bag.  The thing is, you can&#x27;t hang it while closing it up because the hook is at the top of the flap and goes in side.  Also, the bag is much smaller than I thought it was going to be.  I have down graded all of my toiletries to the travel size where I didn&#x27;t have to do that with my previous travel case. I&#x27;m gonna ride this out for a little while.  Maybe it will grow on me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for overseas travel, as I needed something really compact for the new restrictions, yet organizable to hold all our stuff. It&#x27;s got two mesh pockets that zip closed to hold small items like nail clippers and travel size toothpaste, and it&#x27;s got 3 open pockets as shown in the photo for other items. On either side of the main compartment is a small pocket which perfectly holds a full size toothbrush holder, or a 7-day pill box. In addition to that, you can get a full size brush and comb across the bottom of the main compartment, if you haven&#x27;t put too much stuff in it already.

Fully loaded mine doesn&#x27;t take up any more space than a light sweater. I just wish it came in some colors other than black.</li>
    <li> Personally I haven&#x27;t seen this out of the bag yet.  But I got it for my husband who used it this weekend on a business trip and said it was perfect - very convenient.</li>
    <li> My husband works on an oil plattform and this toiletry kit is perfect for him to keep all his toiletries in while showering and allows him to hang it back up in his locker so he doesn&#x27;t clutter up the bathroom for his other co-workers.</li>
    <li> I had ordered one of these a few years ago and had trouble finding it, love it it works great and I got it super quick.  THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> Hook is plastic, and will break. Other than that, plenty of capacity. I would not recommend buying this product for hanging use.</li>
    <li> Great bag. As described.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receipt of this product, I placed travel items in the lower storage bin.  The product became unbalanced and dumped the product out onto the floor before I could place another item inside the storage area.  I attempted this several times with the same results while in the hanging position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company, DB Roth via US Postal Service stating the unbalanced effect returning the item for credit for possible purchase of another product.  DB Roth did not credit my account and sent the sent the malfunctioning product back to me without explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respectfully,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L.N. Yarbrough&lt;br /&gt;USN (Retired)</li>
    <li> The compartments are great, but the front wall is way too low and if you try hanging this cosmetic case up - stuff falls out. Also, the middle pocket/partition in the main big compartment does not connect to the bottom and things go underneath and to the front, only to then fall out. It&#x27;s perfect size and like I said, great amount of compartments, but I will be buying another cosmetic case since I find the inability to hang this up annoying.</li>
    <li> Really convenient layout and still showing no signs of wear after several months of heavy use.</li>
    <li> lived for 1 month then got cut, be advise dont put alot of things even if its small , thats all</li>
    <li> For the price, I guess this is a fine travel case.  However the mesh pocket inside had a seem burst and now it drops stuff into the rest of the bag when it is zipped shut.  Not worth the hassle of trying to return it.  I&#x27;ll just stitch it back together.</li>
    <li> Very useful product, quality design and materials, plenty of space and extra exterior pockets, great for taking on trips or even just for everyday use at home to keep hanging in your bathroom.</li>
