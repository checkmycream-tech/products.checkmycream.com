    <li> Perfect as always, love the product!</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion of all time.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this smell!</li>
    <li> When this first arrived I was a happy about the size, it&#x27;s much larger than what I expected it to be. Since this was the first time I was trying the lotion I was a little scared (cause I can be quite picky) Then I thought \\&quot;what they hey, why not just try it\\&quot; ... and at first I was thinking, \\&quot;Oh no, it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all and kinda waxy\\&quot;...or something like that.....but I gave this darling lotion a try and continued to rub it into my hands and up my arms..... and then...something magical happened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This enchanting, enrapturing smell drifted toward my nose and I was immediately taken into an enchanted world on the wings of faeries and pixies! Oh my! It is literally the BEST and most AMAZING scent that my nose has ever had the pleasure of smelling......*sighs a sigh of love*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about trying this, don&#x27;t think any longer! Put it in your cart and rush order it to your door! I am not even waiting for it to run out before ordering the matching perfume!. I have the smaller hand creme already on the way (for my purse), and because of the lotion I will be investing in the others like the body wash, and bubble bath! (the perfume is still on the way). I keep smelling my hand and the inside of my wrists, and I am taken into a world of wonder.....The most mind blowing, sweet and sensual creme! A++++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case your wondering, it smells sweet, but not an overpowering \\&quot;I just rolled in powdered sugar\\&quot; sweet, but the \\&quot;You know you want to come closer and smell me cause I just ate a small sugary treat\\&quot; sweet. I can see myself swinging on a hammock on the shore of a white sanded beach wearing all sheer flowing silk. I smell a little caramel in there somewhere, with hints of macadamia, vanilla and Jasmine. So delicate and elegant. Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~***Just want to add an update! (the Lotion will \\&quot;seem\\&quot; light/watery but its not and it&#x27;s as if it turns from lotion to a powder as there is no greasy after effect. Even my lil&#x27; ones loved the smell!) Somehow even after hours of using my hands for numerous things that I might not mention and fixing baby bottles and getting them in stinky situations, then washing....the scent of the lotion has stayed! Amazing staying power and I have been in heaven for hours, it has made my day and I needed it after the week I had, just one whiff and I am back into an enchanted world with a smile on my face*~ A little goes a very long way, about the size of a pea amount was applied earlier and the scent is still there and my hands and forearms are magically soft like babies skin, or how about a chinchilla or a really soft bunny? (gave multiple examples just in case you haven&#x27;t felt one of them) lol***~y lil&#x27; ones loved the smell!)

    <li> was old smelled nothing like the scent ..disapointed</li>
    <li> This is my secret weapon I carry in my wallet . I say that because this fragrance has the power to instantly lift my mood and take me to my happy place. Whenever I need a little bit of peace or my hands are dry (whichever comes first;), I reach for this .  The lotion is rich but not greasy. The fragrance is heavenly.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s creamy and not greasy where you feel like you need to wipe your hand with a towel. Smell is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love it and so does my sister</li>
    <li> I found out about this product from my boyfriend&#x27;s sister. If I had to describe this product in two words it would be: Silky Happiness. The product lasts a long time as you only need about the total size of a dime for both hands (I have average size hands even though I&#x27;m only 5&#x27; 3&amp;#34;). I use this product every day (especially now) because I live in California and the Santa Ana winds are torture to my knuckles.  My boyfriend loves the product so much that he will ask to use some whenever I&#x27;m around. His game plan is to be manly and blame the &amp;#34;smell good&amp;#34; scent on his hands on me. ;)</li>
    <li> My hands feel silky smooth and the scent is so heavenly I keep applying it just to continue the joy.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This hand creme is a little pricey but is well worth it.  Smells great and goes on smooth not greasy.  Big plus in my book as this product is made in the USA!</li>
    <li> I was given a mini-tube as a gift. Couldn&#x27;t wait to order the larger size. Smells like heaven and feels even better. My hands love it!</li>
    <li> I love this amazing lotion! Smells great! Feels great! Expensive but worth it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Like all of the cremes in this line, perfect fragrence and makes your hands feel great.</li>
    <li> If I could imagine the smell of heaven this would be it. Absolutely beautiful. The cream itself is average, it&#x27;s the smell, and how it stays! Wow!</li>
    <li> This lotion smell so good. I also love the packaging, it makes feel so glamorous and chic.  I am not 100 percent happy with the lotion formula. It is not greasy at all, so it leaves my hands feeling a bit more tacky feeling then I would like, but the smell of it makes up for it. lol I guess I should just stick to the perfume, instead of the hand lotion.</li>
    <li> My favorite hand creme. Nice strong fragrance and super soft hands. Will be back to buy more.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hand cream. My first experience with it when it was given to me as a hostess gift. It has a wonderful fragrance while softening my work- weary hands. What a treat it is to rub it in well while enjoying the fragrance!  I have since given it to friends for Christmas and again as a hostess gift.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream! I usually don&#x27;t use lotion because I can&#x27;t stand feeling like a have a film of yuck on. This lotion absorbs right in and moisturizes well. Also, it is my favorite scent. It isn&#x27;t too strong that it permeates everything. It is light and lovely. I purchased a small amount of it in a hospital gift shop and then proceeded to buy the 4 oz version the next month because I ran out.</li>
    <li> Excellent gift for loved ones. They all love and use it regularly and get several compliments and inquiries from others.</li>
    <li> Works well, the smell is a bit off for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I am a nurse and it keeps my hands from drying out since I wash them so much throughout the day. Nice scent but not too strong. I recommend this product to everyone. My co-workers love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells so fresh and clean. Reminds me of abridged on the beach durning summer.</li>
    <li> LOVE this creme although the one in stores is thicker and the scent seems to last longer on the store-bought one..</li>
    <li> I spotted the hand cream at Anthropologie while I was traveling and didn&#x27;t want to check a bag just to buy hand lotion (over the 3 oz limit), but I had loved the smell so much that I ordered it as soon as I got home. I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. The smell is subtle but really yummy (sugary, but not overpowering). The lotion is also pretty thin, so it absorbs into my hands quickly while still provided a really nice moisture boost. The really pretty packaging doesn&#x27;t hurt either. This will last me a long time, but when I do run out, I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> This hand cream smells fantastic! It&#x27;s light and aromatic but not too over powering. Is soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. I LOVE it! One of my favorites!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, but I generally use it to surprise her with foot and hand rubs. It goes on clean, meaning non-greasy, and the scent is mild  but nice.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels heavenly!</li>
    <li> very hydrating and soak in my skin really quick, and the pakage is just beautiful, yet I dont really like this kind of creamy sweet sense</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live in the winter without this lotion. Wisconsin winters are harsh and they dry out my hands. This is the only lotion that helps me. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> I love this cream it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Very nice &#x27;girly&#x27; scented hand lotion.  Good price. Very very smooth and creamy hand lotion. Would buy others.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my mom and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Best hand creme i have ever purchased, love the smell and the way my hands feel like silk. Can&#x27;t wait till i try the shower gel.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hand cream!  Thick, but not greasy.  Smells amazing!!  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My sister discovered this lotion first and after she put it on, I asked her what that amazing smell was!  The smell makes me thing about being at the beach.  This is my all time favorite lotion because of the way it smells and because it contains shae butter, which is great for my normal/dry skin.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I did not care for the fragrance, but it does soften the hands nicely.  I gave it to my daughter.  Like any cream you will need to re-apply each time you wash your hands.</li>
    <li> Beautifully light scent. The perfect moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand cream. The smell is wonderful and it is rich and creamy.  It is expensive but, I think well worth it. I recommend it...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent that Lollia does &amp; I was thrilled with the price &amp; that it was delivered sooner than promised. Would order from them again!!</li>
