      <li>my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in ages.</li>
      <li>smells good</li>
      <li>I found that the best used for this product are to A. Apply to damp hair right before blow drying.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It has been great for us and easy to use.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not at all cost effective.</li>
      <li>The foam is a nice change for a detangler.  </li>
      <li>I will give it points for smelling nice like most Garnier products.</li>
      <li>Not to mention that it smells really nice and fruity. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>The rest of my hair is covered with a mix of the HR with a (very light) mousse .</li>
      <li>it sure as heck does not feel lightweight.</li>
      <li>My hair seems a lot better looking and shinier.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much more convenient &amp; easier on the hands than spray in conditioners.  </li>
      <li>love Garnier.</li>
      <li>but okay.</li>
      <li>What I wanted was a more touchable look and this provided just that.</li>
      <li>(so better curls for me,</li>
      <li>Save your money for something much better than this.</li>
      <li>Leave-in is my favorite in the purple bottle at the salon.</li>
      <li>I have a processed curly perm that can absorb most products and get frizzy at the ends.</li>
      <li>but in between, I needed something to give my hair some more moisture and smoothness as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would like to suggest a leave in that I love.</li>
      <li>I wouldn’t say I LOVE it</li>
      <li>the perfect twistout that lasts all day without turning into a massive un-defined &#x27;fro!</li>
      <li>This made my hair tangle even more.</li>
      <li>I think it works best on hair that is already completely dry and has started to frizz or when curls needs a pick-me-up.</li>
      <li>and I would consider this a cheap, good-smelling runny mousse at most.</li>
      <li>love and it does not dry your hair, I have fine hair and it works great.</li>
      <li>I can brush it just fine as well.</li>
      <li>have shoulder length hair, fine and medium thickness type of hair</li>
      <li>and you put a cheap lotion on</li>
      <li>on my own personal experience, I would say this product is excellent for people with short to medium-short (hand-length hair</li>
      <li>It moisturizes and helps keep the curls smooth and in place throughout the day.</li>
      <li>and I think that is a far superior product to this one.</li>
      <li>product is rich, and if you have fine hair, then it must be used in moderation.  </li>
      <li>I guess I should have just stuck with worked in the first place!!</li>
      <li>no stiky, I like the odor, no drandruff, leave hair soft and clean after you style it, and the time delivered is good</li>
      <li>I can go more than 3 days without having to wash my hair to get bouncy, light curls thanks to this product.</li>
      <li>great for my dry hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my tried and true Infusium 23.</li>
      <li>Use light handedly with just 1 pump for shoulder length hair for starters until you get a feel for how much is right for you.</li>
      <li>and it comes out frothy and foamy but quickly turns into a gooey liquid.</li>
      <li>I feel it is more suitable for men, just because it seems to me that men usually prefer more firmness in their hair styling.</li>
      <li>The product performs very well, is silky, and is ultra light.</li>
      <li>Currently I am really liking Loreal&#x27;s EverSleek leave in, which is a light creamy conditioner, oil based with some glycerin in it.  </li>
      <li>and so far it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>If you have thicker hair it would be perfect but for someone with thin hair it is a no go.  </li>
      <li>Its been two months and the only reason my hair looks nice is because of this.</li>
      <li>I saw the words &amp;#34;hydra recharge&amp;#34;, they definitely piqued my curiosity since my hair could ALWAYS use some kind of hydra recharge.  </li>
      <li>it was going to be a nice lightweight creamy foam that I could put on my hair after a shower for extra conditioning.</li>
      <li>Not even worth trying.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty fantastic for no heat curls I chose a no heat curl method that is suitable for wearing in public held all day no other products then slept on it</li>
      <li>I think it would get higher ratings that way.  </li>
      <li>It smells great, but the product itself sucks.</li>
      <li>This is different than most leave in conditioners the first day it is like a mousse</li>
      <li>and I have to use SOOOO much of it!</li>
      <li>but I think I will have to throw this product away, which is a first for me.</li>
      <li>But I wait about 5 min then blowdry, and it ends up making my hair really soft, light &amp; bouncy.</li>
      <li>and I apply the Hydra Recharge first</li>
      <li>I think this stuff is perfect IF you have thick, coarse and/or curly hair.</li>
      <li>I found that this left me with soft, defined curls and my hair looked nice and shiny.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it would work better on severely dry hair??</li>
      <li>, it is a foam, and my leave-in cream (Loreal&#x27;s Ever Sleek)  after, and I do that for each section, then let my hair air dry, and my curls are happy and soft, not dry and</li>
      <li>It is probably better for those people who blow dry</li>
      <li>it to be a bit flexible, have certain degree of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>but really, my hair is super SOFT with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It actually felt smooth going onto my hair</li>
      <li>The consistency of the product is very mousse</li>
      <li>This is my go-to product for reviving tired or frizzy curls, and is also a great finisher.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in spray, no that stuff is great for thin hair in my experience.</li>
      <li>and it’s also really curly</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it and it REALLY works.</li>
      <li>but it really depends on what hair you have, you just have to try out what might or might not work with your hair.</li>
      <li>and I really wanted to like it,</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much those reviews were using or if company has changed formula maybe.  </li>
      <li>This foam acts much like a foam version of hair spray and goes on damp, dries in seconds.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like this leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>Immediately upon pumping it into my hands I noticed that it was really sticky and gooey.</li>
      <li>and It does help keep my hair very moisturized</li>
      <li>I consider this great-smelling product to be as much a styling product as a conditioner because it provides medium hold, so use sparingly.  </li>
      <li>It dries stiffly, like gel or hairspray, and combing it out kind of softens it</li>
      <li>It just takes one or two pumps to smooth down the top layer of my hair (even though it&#x27;s pretty long and wavy)</li>
      <li>I distributed it throughout my hair easily and let it air dry.</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair look alive again and super soft.</li>
      <li>That is pretty much the exact opposite of the result that I had hoped to achieve.</li>
      <li>wise, it runs a little over $6 at my local drugstore.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> love and it does not dry your hair, I have fine hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to product for reviving tired or frizzy curls, and is also a great finisher.  I consider this great-smelling product to be as much a styling product as a conditioner because it provides medium hold, so use sparingly.  I wish that Garnier might have labelled it as &amp;#34;a moisturizing styling gel&amp;#34; so people can know what to expect. I think it would get higher ratings that way.  I think it works best on hair that is already completely dry and has started to frizz or when curls needs a pick-me-up. Use light handedly with just 1 pump for shoulder length hair for starters until you get a feel for how much is right for you.</li>
    <li> This is different than most leave in conditioners the first day it is like a mousse so yes it will be sticky when you apply it and probably should be used as a styling product and then on second day hair it is very soft. It probably should have been labeled as Moistuizing mousse so you know what you are in for you will only get the moisture if you don&#x27;t wash your hair the next day. It&#x27;s pretty fantastic for no heat curls I chose a no heat curl method that is suitable for wearing in public held all day no other products then slept on it took it out the following morning expecting some pretty loose curls given I was using leave in conditioner much to my surpise it caused my hair to look exactly like the tutorial (which I had to use normal mousse to get them to hold) but be extremly soft instead of crunchy like regular mouse. I&#x27;d recommend this product for use for hold on the first day and super soft hair on the second</li>
    <li> Hair products is really a highly personalized market. If what you need is a gel, than moisturizing cream is not the thing for you.&lt;br /&gt;However, sometimes it&#x27;s not a clear cut. I like certain \\&quot;fullness\\&quot; in my hair, but in the same time I like it to be a bit flexible, have certain degree of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;For me - this is the perfect product. I use it after the shower to kinda let my hair \\&quot;settle in\\&quot; while still maintaining some of the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;Based on my own personal experience, I would say this product is excellent for people with short to medium-short (hand-length hair) haircut. I feel it is more suitable for men, just because it seems to me that men usually prefer more firmness in their hair styling.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful and I really wanted to like it, but there&#x27;s no way this could be classified as a leave in conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t condition in the least, it makes hair sticky and tangles your hair. I have wavy, normal hair and I would consider this a cheap, good-smelling runny mousse at most. I would like to suggest a leave in that I love. Regis design line enchanted midnight Leave-in is my favorite in the purple bottle at the salon. Only around $12.00. Returning the hydra charge.</li>
    <li> I have super dry hair that tangles in the back and this works well on it.  The foam is a nice change for a detangler.  I use it only on the hair at the back and so far it&#x27;s okay.  Not terrific but okay.</li>
    <li> smells good it&#x27;s just wonderful</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been finding this post-hair-wash product hard to find in stores so perhaps Garnier is phasing out this product. It has been great for us and easy to use. Three pumps, rub into hair, brush, and done.</li>
    <li> I have a processed curly perm that can absorb most products and get frizzy at the ends. I use Hydra Recharge as a styling aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a couple pumps of just the leave-in on the ends of my hair. The rest of my hair is covered with a mix of the HR with a (very light) mousse . I then let it air dry. Later I gently scrunch away the slight &#x27;crunchy&#x27; feel and have  bouncy frizz-free curls all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not stop making Hydra Recharge!</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick, coarse hair that I take very good care of. I use dry shampoo religiously to minimize unnecessarily drying out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked after reading the other comments. This product is most excellent.  I apply it to my dry hair and it really does moisturize.  I like that it foams up and helps me to distribute the product as evenly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like the other people who reviewed the product negatively must have very fine, thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product is rich, and if you have fine hair, then it must be used in moderation.  Perhaps they just didn&#x27;t know how to use the product correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Thick haired people like myself know that it&#x27;s very difficult to use too much product.</li>
    <li> I suppose the mixed reviews have to do with varying hair textures between users however I have big curly hair that tangles easily and will get dry without some sort of taming product. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products and this is one of the very few that actually improves the quality of my hair and keeps moisture in it days later. I can go more than 3 days without having to wash my hair to get bouncy, light curls thanks to this product. You have to think of it like moose rather than a leave in conditioner. It&#x27;s meant to be an additional supplement - not just something to use without any other products or without a little work on your own part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do:&lt;br /&gt;1 : comb out my hair completely&lt;br /&gt;2 : wash it with my shampoo (not garnier)&lt;br /&gt;3 : wash it with garnier damage eraser conditioner&lt;br /&gt;4: comb it out with a wide tooth comb&lt;br /&gt;5: let it air dry for a few minutes and when it&#x27;s still damp, section my hair into layers and add 2 pumps to each layer and scrunch it.&lt;br /&gt;6: after it dries I add my leave in conditioner spray (not garnier) and add a little more of the hydra recharge moisture whip&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry hard and it stays soft (it actually gets softer throughout the day) all day.</li>
    <li> Permed hair - helps the curl!!</li>
    <li> I bleach my dark brown hair blonde so need to use many hydrating products. I wouldn&#x27;t call this product a miracle by any means (can&#x27;t buy miracle for $4) but I don&#x27;t ahve any complaints.  Not sticky or goopy.  I don&#x27;t know how much those reviews were using or if company has changed formula maybe.  Seems to leave my hair soft.  Honestly, I use such a combo of products its hard to tell what each one does! I use detangler/leave-in conditioner, this, then a hair silk to prevent tangles in my lonnggg hair, and a mouse to manage flyaways &amp; maintain my part.</li>
    <li> I give this a one star for the pleasant smell and price.  It really weighs my hair down and makes my hair feel sticky.  I would not purchase it again or recommend it to anyone.  Perhaps it would work better on severely dry hair??</li>
    <li> I think that a lot of people misuse the product. It&#x27;s suppose to go on damp hair just a small squirt into the palm of your hand and worked into the ends of your hair worked to the top. I&#x27;ve used it and it REALLY works. I destroyed my hair by bleaching it and this product has been a life saver. It never leaves my hair sticky slimy or stiff. I can brush it just fine as well. It&#x27;s really a great product.</li>
    <li> I color my hair like crazy so it gets dry. I do leave-in hair masks overnight once a week but in between, I needed something to give my hair some more moisture and smoothness as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Garnier. I use their other hair products and usually have good luck but this leave-in treatment is a bit of a bust. I don&#x27;t think it made my hair worse and it was a *little* softer after two week&#x27;s use but…meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump design and it comes out frothy and foamy but quickly turns into a gooey liquid. I tried both damp and dry. DON&#x27;T PUT IT ON DRY HAIR! On damp hair, after a shower (I only condition every day, and shampoo once every two weeks--dry climate + hard water&#x3D;hard on hair), I apply it pretty much right away. It dries stiffly, like gel or hairspray, and combing it out kind of softens it but it doesn&#x27;t feel all that great…and a little sticky. Plus, if you don&#x27;t dry it completely and put it up, it&#x27;s like a bird&#x27;s nest. And sticky. Not, run your fingers through it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair, fine and medium thickness type of hair and I have to use SOOOO much of it! I just bought it and I&#x27;m almost out and at five bucks a pop, it&#x27;s not at all cost effective.</li>
    <li> Finding a great conditioner has been so difficult for me. I&#x27;m a biracial woman with long, very thick, and curly hair. This makes styling my hair MUCH easier and very soft. Make sure to use it on wet or damp hair ONLY. It&#x27;ll be hard to comb your hair if you use it on dry hair.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair feeling extremely heavy, sticky and dry. It was terrible, I tried it 2x and had the same results twice. I threw it out.</li>
    <li> I would save the 5 dollars and the condition of your hair and not use this. This totally dried out my hair and made it lose all moisture and shine.  This made my hair tangle even more. The only positive is the tropical scent. I like garnier conditioners and other hair oils but I think I will have to throw this product away, which is a first for me.</li>
    <li> no stiky, I like the odor, no drandruff, leave hair soft and clean after you style it, and the time delivered is good</li>
    <li> I have THICK wavy hair. After using the straight iron for so long I grew unhappy with the constant fried hair, so i needed to come up with a &amp;#34; natural look &amp;#34; or at least stop with the heat. Its been two months and the only reason my hair looks nice is because of this. This leave in condition works almost like a jell, but doesn&#x27;t get hard. I noticed the reviews are all over the place but it really depends on what hair you have, you just have to try out what might or might not work with your hair. This product makes my hair look alive again and super soft. I stock up when I can. It completely eliminates all my frizzes.</li>
    <li> This stuff helps control the crazy frizzies that come with naturally curly hair and summertime weather.  This is something I cannot run out of EVER!</li>
    <li> This product actually left my hair stiff, like if I put gel on it.</li>
    <li> Best product to moisturize your hair!</li>
    <li> Horrible...leaves hair feeling sticky and gummy. Hard to comb through. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought it would make my hair dry straight, because when I let it air dry my hair gets frizzy. this made it WAY worse, my hair is currently blown up literally 2x bigger than when I wouldn&#x27;t use this. this isn&#x27;t the first time garnier disappointed me.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this locally, then read reviews and thought ISH... but really, my hair is super SOFT with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that after I towel dry my hair, then apply this foam, my hair doesnt feel soft or smooth at all. But I wait about 5 min then blowdry, and it ends up making my hair really soft, light &amp; bouncy. Love it!</li>
    <li> Wow! what??? these negative reviews are about to make me go out and buy every bottle of this off the shelf before Garnier discontinues. Seriously though people - don&#x27;t believe the hype! And by hype I mean the negative reviews on this product. Has no one ever heard of re-purposing? I wash my hair, I detangle it - preferably with hb olive creme then once my hair dries, i use this product along with olive oil to twist. I go to sleep, I wake up, I untwist, and voila. the perfect twistout that lasts all day without turning into a massive un-defined &#x27;fro! Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with a &#x27;fro. An accidental &#x27;fro though? no thanks! this is a staple!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got very thick &amp;#34;2B - Wavy Curvy&amp;#34; hair as described on Naturally Curly dot com. Using just the moisture whip by itself my hair was crunchy in spots; like if I used a bad curling mousse and didn&#x27;t work it in right. It also leaves your hands sticky. It may have reduced the amount of frizz by the end of the day but I wasn&#x27;t paying it any attention. Because I have the stuff, I&#x27;ve been mixing it in with my curl mousse for the past three weeks. I&#x27;ve seen no change in my hair. At least it didn&#x27;t make anything worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed! My usual leave-in was out of stock and my preferred leave-in is expensive. I was looking for a less expensive substitute and decided to give this a try. After reading the reviews, I was a little scared that I had purchased a bad product for my hair. Couldn&#x27;t be more wrong. I still prefer my it&#x27;s a 10 leave-in, but this is definitely a less expensive option that if used correctly works. I found that the best used for this product are to A. Apply to damp hair right before blow drying. It acts as a conditioner and a straightening agent at once. B. Use on damp hair, apply product to scrunch and curl (I use Frizz-ease daily curl enhancing spray) and let dry naturally. It moisturizes and helps keep the curls smooth and in place throughout the day. I have naturally wavey/lightly curly hair, it&#x27;s dry from over-coloring, not thick but not thin either. I recommend this product for similar hair types.</li>
    <li> I like this product! I wouldn’t say I LOVE it but I like it and it’s something I would buy if it were on sale again. I have thin hair but a lot of it so it comes off as thick and it’s also really curly so whatever products I use I will always put in my hair while wet or damp. The consistency of the product is very mousse like but lighter in density. I put about 4-5 pumps on my hands and combed, with my hands, through my wet hair. I don’t know how the other users applied it but my hair did not come out stringy, hard or crunchy. It actually came out softer and it feels nice(I didn’t use a blow dryer or anything because that would be counterproductive, I air dry my hair always). I bought this product because in the winter months my hair becomes very dried out and here in Pennsylvania we had a very long winter so I needed something to rejuvenate it. I give this product an overall 4 out of 5.</li>
    <li> This made my hair very heavy and weighed down, opposite of what i have read in reviews.  If you have thicker hair it would be perfect but for someone with thin hair it is a no go.  I ended up not using this and instead spent the extra money on the it&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in spray, no that stuff is great for thin hair in my experience.</li>
    <li> I give this 2 stars simply based on smell. It smells great, but the product itself sucks. I was looking for some leave in treatment last minute at the store. Unfortunately, I should have read the reviews first before buying. I have really long, thin hair and it&#x27;s prone to breakage so I was hoping to find something that softened my hair up while moisturizing. This works really well going on, but when it dries, it is like a sticky mess. My hair ends up in a little nest by the end of the day. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair soft, doesn&#x27;t help smoothness and it sure as heck does not feel lightweight. Maybe it&#x27;s my hair type, but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Smells great but extremely difficult to spread through my long hair. Also, you can purchase this at Walmart for around 5 dollars instead of 12.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel it conditions well for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was going to be a nice lightweight creamy foam that I could put on my hair after a shower for extra conditioning. It literally feels like foaming mousse. It gets sticky and hardens hair just like mousse. It&#x27;s as insubstantial as mousse. Sigh... I don&#x27;t like to use heat tools on my hair so I don&#x27;t think I should have to blow dry after using this product. It doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s necessary on the bottle. I will give it points for smelling nice like most Garnier products. I gave it at least two stars because I am just using it as a light mousse on my damp hair for scrunching when I want wavy hair. It works well for that purpose. Hope this helps someone else considering this product.</li>
    <li> As advertised. I have been using this product for over a year and have been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> great for my dry hair</li>
    <li> This product made my hair so sticky and straw like I felt like my hair become a big mess of a tangled birds nest. This is absolutely horrible for the hair! I used it twice than tossed that junk into the trash. I brought this at my local Target thinking it would do something for my hair and since it was fairly new when I first got it I wanted to try it out. BIGGEST MISTAKE. Save your money for something much better than this.</li>
    <li> my hair is DRY.  Like it will look like dried straw without any product in it after a shower.  I have ALWAYS left conditioner in my hair as a leave-in, since the 80&#x27;s when the concept of a leave-in didn&#x27;t exist.  I still use a leave-in today.  Currently I am really liking Loreal&#x27;s EverSleek leave in, which is a light creamy conditioner, oil based with some glycerin in it.  I am now, using this moisture whip product before my leave in conditioner and It does help keep my hair very moisturized (so better curls for me, less frizz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the words &amp;#34;hydra recharge&amp;#34;, they definitely piqued my curiosity since my hair could ALWAYS use some kind of hydra recharge.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now, every time I wet my hair (about every other day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after I am out of the shower and have gotten some of the excess water our of my hair with a towel, and before I apply my leave in cream.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to keep my hair dripping wet for the moisture.  I can t-shirt dry my hair some, until no water is dripping, then I section it in about 5 large sections (I have LOTS of hair)  and I apply the Hydra Recharge first, it is a foam, and my leave-in cream (Loreal&#x27;s Ever Sleek)  after, and I do that for each section, then let my hair air dry, and my curls are happy and soft, not dry and frizz is fairly under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a watery, almost clear liquid in the bottle and comes out as a foam in your hand.  It does have a slight sticky residue, so you have to wash your hands when you are done.  But I do not notice any visible residue on my hair at all.  But my hair feels very soft in the shower when I go wash it every couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ir doesn&#x27;t leave any crunch in my hair, but I think it is because I use it under my creamy leave -in.  So the oils in my cream I think do away with the possible crunch for this product.  I have used the foam of Hydra Recharge by itself as a second-day hair refresher and it does leave some crunch on my hair when used by itself.  Not a stiff crunch like a gel though.  Less than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Water, propylene glycol, vinylamine/vinylformamide copolymer, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, phenoxyethanol, polyquaternium-4, parfum, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, hydroxyethylcellullose, lactic acid, hexyl cinnamal, lycium barbarum fruit extract, kiwi fruit water, methylisothiazolinone, benzyl alcohol, linalool, amyl cinnamal, citric acid, passiflora fruit juice, bisabolol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;price wise, it runs a little over $6 at my local drugstore.  The $4.97 here at amazon is the same I&#x27;ve seen at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this product.  I think if you have normal hair and are looking for an everyday or once in a while leave in, it would be good.  I have very fine, thin hair with ends damaged from coloring.  One review said perhaps people are misusing this product and using too much, leaving a sticky feeling, but for seriously dry hair, if you don&#x27;t use a lot, it doesn&#x27;t do much.  I also have a hard time spreading it through my fine hair.  I&#x27;ll stick with my tried and true Infusium 23.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair a little shinier&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Feels like hair spray when I put it in my hair. I had a lot of trouble getting a comb or my fingers through my hair when this product was in it.&lt;br /&gt;Made it harder to get tangles out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I combed my hair afterwards I got TONS of fallout. I had to use tape on my clothes and lap to get all of the hair that fell out after I combed it out. I could pull a handful of my hair out of my comb, brush, and clothes every day when I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy this again. The cons far outweigh the pros</li>
    <li> I use this stuff a lot in lieu of hair spray since hair spray irritates my lungs and gets on my glasses. This foam acts much like a foam version of hair spray and goes on damp, dries in seconds. As it dries, it acts like a little tiny top layer of hair spray, keeping flyaway hair and frizz tame. As the day wears on it incorporates into your hair making it very soft and yet it keeps my hair from frizzing out in humidity. It is true that the foam is slightly tacky on your hands as it dries momentarily, but that passes quickly and simply washing your hands or rubbing them on a cloth fixes it. The solution is not &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s just foam, it&#x27;s wet at first. It just takes one or two pumps to smooth down the top layer of my hair (even though it&#x27;s pretty long and wavy) and I use it daily! Will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly it has a pleasing scent and works for sensitive skin with allergies and strengthens your hair - I have fewer split ends!</li>
    <li> because of having coarse, frizzy hair, I have to let mine air dry, as this makes it curly, while blow drying makes it very frizzy.  This product is terrible for just leave in.  As other reviewers have said, it left my hair feeling more dried out than ever as well as sort of greasy.  It actually was good for setting curls but my hair felt terrible.  It is probably better for those people who blow dry</li>
    <li> Puzzled by the mixed reviews but everyone has different needs and hair issues. In my case being a &amp;#34;woman of a certain age&amp;#34; who still has oily skin in the T zone and used to have to wash her hair daily - well, things have changed as I&#x27;ve gotten older - e.g. less oil. Have reasonably thick but fine textured straight hair past my shoulders that was just frying from getting colored - e.g. I air dry my hair, hardly do anything to it except comb but it was dry, dry - great color but DRY and felt like straw, and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my stylist says stop trying oils they are too heavy for me, go for a product that&#x27;s a humectant e.g. a product that holds and attracts moisture. So I&#x27;ve been round the block with all kinds of products$$$, and gave this a try - OMG my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in ages. Or felt so silky. No serum or leave-in or oil has done what this did, and makes the fly-way ends hang together and the shine is ridiculous, looks like I used a glosser. This doesn&#x27;t seem heavy to me at all, not like an oil serum. But on me it WORKS - no more frizzy straw hair. The only bad part is companies never seem to hold onto their products, but I just bought 3 bottles and am thinking about writing the company to thank them. I use as directed, towel off, 2 pumps spread into damp hair, comb, done. Wonder if I buy a case how long this stuff will last?</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this product and man was I disappointed. This is basically in a liquid form in the bottle, and the nozzle makes it foam up before you put it on your hair. I thought it would be a light moisture that would not weigh down my hair. Immediately upon pumping it into my hands I noticed that it was really sticky and gooey. Not a good start. But I decided to put it in my hair anyways. It actually felt smooth going onto my hair so I still had hope that it would work well, but that was not meant to be. When I tried to comb my hair to put in a ponytail (which is what I always do when I let my hair dry naturally) The comb was getting stuck in my hair really bad and it felt like I had glue in there. It only got worse as the product dried. My hair feels straw-like, and it is very frizzy and has tons of little flyaways.  That is pretty much the exact opposite of the result that I had hoped to achieve. I will definitely not purchase this again. I have already used the Garnier sleek and shine anti-frizz serum for quite some time and I think that is a far superior product to this one. I guess I should have just stuck with worked in the first place!!</li>
    <li> I think this stuff is perfect IF you have thick, coarse and/or curly hair. My hair is all of that plus extremely dry. I found that this left me with soft, defined curls and my hair looked nice and shiny. I don&#x27;t like the crunchy feel of mousse or gel. What I wanted was a more touchable look and this provided just that. I have long hair and two pumps was enough. I distributed it throughout my hair easily and let it air dry.</li>
    <li> Weighs my hair down, I prefer the leave in conditioner I think.</li>
    <li> Smells great and dries swiftly</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t attest to whether this helps moisturize hair because after two uses I am going to quit. I used barely one pump that made my hair feel sticky.</li>
    <li> Has that delicious fruity smell that Garnier is known for. It&#x27;s so much more convenient &amp; easier on the hands than spray in conditioners.  The product performs very well, is silky, and is ultra light. Price is good too. I&#x27;m not left with those nasty white flakes in my hair when it dries. Conditioning thick curly hair is no longer a chore. A plus product!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this leave in conditioner. It leaves slimy goopy sticky gel like strands in my hair even though it is foaming. The same slimy stuff gets all over the side of the pump even though I wipe it after every use. It makes my hair feel heavy and weighed down. The strands feel dry, yet greasy. It is hard to explain but it is sort of like if you have dry skin and you put a cheap lotion on, you feel greasy but yet you still have dry skin because it didn&#x27;t actually moisturize. This is the same feeling I get with this product. It is a let down because I am a garnier fructis fan.</li>
    <li> This does not work. Not even worth trying.</li>
    <li> I feel that the issue that lots of people were having with this product (maybe) that they were using it wrong. I used it on damp hair and used a blow dryer. My hair seems a lot better looking and shinier. Not to mention that it smells really nice and fruity. &#x3D;)</li>
