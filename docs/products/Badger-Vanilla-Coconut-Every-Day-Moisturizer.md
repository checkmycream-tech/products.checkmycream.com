### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of processed chemical junk in it.  </li>
      <li>just applying it at night before bed does the trick and keeps my hands in great condition.</li>
      <li>a great all around non-irritating  moisurizer / body lubricant</li>
      <li>Feels very nice.</li>
      <li>Smells very nice.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice hand balm.&lt;br /&gt;After buying it, though, I tried Badger&#x27;s nutmeg &amp; shea moisturizer, and that was simply amazing!</li>
      <li>I keep rubbing, or wipe them with a paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of vanilla is pleasant, and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>We love it!</li>
      <li>We love this!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>my husband and I find this subtley-sweet moisurizer handy...</li>
      <li>Nice smell, absorbs well into the skin.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant, not too strong, fragrance.</li>
      <li>Love the ingredients and the very mild but nice vanilla coconut smell.</li>
      <li>This product is USDA certified organic, and is scored \\&quot;0\\&quot; (\\&quot;0\\&quot; being best) on EWG&#x27;s skin deep cosmetic safety database.</li>
      <li>All of the ingredients are top notch, no nasties in this one.</li>
      <li>I use it to moisturize my hands and arms mostly and carry it in my bag.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a balm.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I guess everyone has their favorite.</li>
      <li>I have never used a better moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I am quite pleased with this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Wasnt pleased with consistency.</li>
      <li>very nice, you need very little great for winter chapped hands</li>
      <li>Good price and really like that it is chemical free.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I was able to return it with full refund.</li>
      <li>Smooth and silky with a light fragrance.</li>
      <li>Even applied lightly, my face feels like I am wearing a wax mask.</li>
      <li>Nice light smell, feels good, but not as healing as other reviews suggest.</li>
      <li>As with all all of the Badger products I&#x27;ve purchased over the past ten-plus years, this vanilla coconut is excellent.</li>
      <li>It has a wonderfully light sweet scent of fresh coconuts and vanilla.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad if accidentally tasted, either...</li>
      <li>Goes on nicely and moisturizers my skin, the scent fades quickly, but leaves my skin soft.</li>
      <li>although not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>Best for dry  skin prone to eczema , wish it came In bigger sizes.</li>
      <li>(I save the herbier-scented products for home), and that the tin fits perfectly in my work jacket for a little moisture after frequent hand-washing.</li>
      <li>Nice balm, more heavy on the vanilla scent than coconut.  </li>
      <li>I use this primarily on my knees and elbows, and the key is to use this after showering since your skin is more likely to be warm, as it will help soften the product up.</li>
      <li>Tip - use the back of your fingernail to scrape out some, then warm it in your palms before trying to spread it on your body.</li>
      <li>To apply it lightly on my face and neck, I have to keep rubbing across the surface until the heat from my fingers melts it enough to get a light coating on my fingers to apply.</li>
      <li>Basically applying this once a day does a better job than lotions that you have to apply constantly throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It would take hours to get enough of the \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; to be able to spread it on my skin.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very subtle and pleasant!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the small tin put you off, it&#x27;s super handy to travel with</li>
      <li>I purchased this item to use on my legs that suffer from dry skin in the winter and have been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>The fact that it is organic is certainly an added bonus.</li>
      <li>In the warmer months, this really softens up and is much easier to work with.</li>
      <li>Digging a glob of it out of the can might work for covering larger areas, but not for a light application.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t like as much as the &amp;#34;hard working hands&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Scent is ok, not really coconut or vanilla,</li>
      <li>and like I said, you don&#x27;t need much so</li>
      <li>It it rated really low on EWG website, which means it has very few harmful chemicals in it, which is great because moisturizers absorb into your skin!&lt;br /</li>
      <li>it smells light and relatively neutral for a natural product</li>
      <li>Highly recommend all Badger products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for softening the occasional dry, rough patches on my face and arms.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m prone to breakouts, this does really well on my body and my skin stays soft all day.</li>
      <li>While I love the clean scent, it is difficult to apply.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s kept my hands completely soft this winter.</li>
      <li>It is super moisturizing and the only thing that heals my dry winter skin.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light, melts quickly (isn&#x27;t waxy like other balms) and isn&#x27;t irritating to even the most delicate body parts.  </li>
      <li>You can then dip your fingers in to apply to other areas, but it is kind of a slow process.</li>
      <li>No dry, chapped hands this year!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say how well it works because I haven&#x27;t really used it due to consistency.</li>

<li> We Use it for dry hands, chapped cheeks or wind block when playing outside in the winter, use on the baby after bath, lip balm, and on my son&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way too, I was surprised.</li>
<li> A little does go a long way, and I would consider this as a product for targeting specific problematic (dry) areas rather than as an overall moisturizer, which really wouldn&#x27;t be practical, given the texture and small 2 oz.</li>
<li> I have to repeatedly wash my hands at work and they really dry out in the winder.</li>
<li> I do not like, not moisturizing, very dry Used up.</li>
<li> My hands get very dry in the winter months.</li>
<li> Mo more dry painful hands</li>
<li> The texture is a thick and solid balm.</li>
<li> Can be a little &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; just just coconut oil.</li>
<li> I do find that after applying it and rubbing it in, my hands are sometimes a little greasy.</li>
<li> Possibly I received an old, dried up can, but it&#x27;s impossible to use.  </li>
<li> It is like a hard wax in a can.</li>
<li> Hard to get out of tin.</li>
<li> It absorbs well, but it is a little difficult to spread.</li>
<li> Not happy with the product at all.  </li>
<li> I use it as a lip balm, which makes it, ounce for ounce, the least expensive of all the balms I buy.</li>

    <li> While I love the clean scent, it is difficult to apply. It is like a hard wax in a can. To apply it lightly on my face and neck, I have to keep rubbing across the surface until the heat from my fingers melts it enough to get a light coating on my fingers to apply. Digging a glob of it out of the can might work for covering larger areas, but not for a light application. Even applied lightly, my face feels like I am wearing a wax mask. I don&#x27;t like the feel of it on my face.</li>
    <li> my husband and I find this subtley-sweet moisurizer handy... it&#x27;s light, melts quickly (isn&#x27;t waxy like other balms) and isn&#x27;t irritating to even the most delicate body parts.  It&#x27;s not bad if accidentally tasted, either... a great all around non-irritating  moisurizer / body lubricant</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been putting this on at night before bed and it&#x27;s kept my hands completely soft this winter. No dry, chapped hands this year! It takes awhile to soak in, and definitely not something I could handle during the day because of the greasy feel, but just applying it at night before bed does the trick and keeps my hands in great condition. Basically applying this once a day does a better job than lotions that you have to apply constantly throughout the day. I will definitely keep this gem on hand!</li>
    <li> This item arrived in well packaged box.  I am quite pleased with this moisturizer.  I purchased this item to use on my legs that suffer from dry skin in the winter and have been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like as much as the &amp;#34;hard working hands&amp;#34;</li>

    <li> Yummy scent.  Keep it next to my bed and apply every night.</li>
    <li> I put this on every night before bed, it smells like vanilla ice-cream and I love it. It it rated really low on EWG website, which means it has very few harmful chemicals in it, which is great because moisturizers absorb into your skin!&lt;br /&gt;** Tip - use the back of your fingernail to scrape out some, then warm it in your palms before trying to spread it on your body.</li>
    <li> very nice, you need very little great for winter chapped hands</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! It has a wonderfully light sweet scent of fresh coconuts and vanilla. A little bit goes a long way too, I was surprised. All of the ingredients are top notch, no nasties in this one. Although I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face- I&#x27;m prone to breakouts, this does really well on my body and my skin stays soft all day. Don&#x27;t let the small tin put you off, it&#x27;s super handy to travel with and like I said, you don&#x27;t need much so it lasts longer than you&#x27;d think.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice. Feels very nice.</li>
    <li> Best for dry  skin prone to eczema , wish it came In bigger sizes.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is super moisturizing and the only thing that heals my dry winter skin. The scent is very subtle and pleasant!</li>
    <li> I have never used a better moisturizer. My hands get very dry in the winter months. This totally revitalizes my skin.</li>
    <li> Nice light smell, feels good, but not as healing as other reviews suggest.</li>
    <li> Smooth and silky with a light fragrance. Can be a little &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; just just coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Wasnt pleased with consistency. I thought it would be creamy. Hard to get out of tin. Had to dig it out . It&#x27;s more of a balm. Scent is ok, not really coconut or vanilla, although not unpleasant. Can&#x27;t say how well it works because I haven&#x27;t really used it due to consistency.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hand balm.&lt;br /&gt;After buying it, though, I tried Badger&#x27;s nutmeg &amp; shea moisturizer, and that was simply amazing! I guess everyone has their favorite. I would give this a &#x27;8&#x27; and the nutmeg &amp; shea a &#x27;10&#x27;. I am still using both; this one sits on my desk at work. I do find that after applying it and rubbing it in, my hands are sometimes a little greasy. I keep rubbing, or wipe them with a paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of vanilla is pleasant, and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I do not like, not moisturizing, very dry Used up.</li>
    <li> As with all all of the Badger products I&#x27;ve purchased over the past ten-plus years, this vanilla coconut is excellent. I use it as a lip balm, which makes it, ounce for ounce, the least expensive of all the balms I buy. It&#x27;s also great for softening the occasional dry, rough patches on my face and arms.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I have to repeatedly wash my hands at work and they really dry out in the winder. Started putting this on each morning, and problem solved. Mo more dry painful hands</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients and the very mild but nice vanilla coconut smell. I use it to moisturize my hands and arms mostly and carry it in my bag. Highly recommend all Badger products.</li>
    <li> We love this!  We Use it for dry hands, chapped cheeks or wind block when playing outside in the winter, use on the baby after bath, lip balm, and on my son&#x27;s eczema.  It smells great and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of processed chemical junk in it.  We love it!</li>
    <li> Personally I like the smell (reminds me a bit of cocoa butter) and the texture of this product. The fact that it is organic is certainly an added bonus. The texture is a thick and solid balm. I use this primarily on my knees and elbows, and the key is to use this after showering since your skin is more likely to be warm, as it will help soften the product up. You can then dip your fingers in to apply to other areas, but it is kind of a slow process. In the warmer months, this really softens up and is much easier to work with. A little does go a long way, and I would consider this as a product for targeting specific problematic (dry) areas rather than as an overall moisturizer, which really wouldn&#x27;t be practical, given the texture and small 2 oz. container.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, absorbs well into the skin.  Good price and really like that it is chemical free.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product is USDA certified organic, and is scored \\&quot;0\\&quot; (\\&quot;0\\&quot; being best) on EWG&#x27;s skin deep cosmetic safety database. I like that it smells light and relatively neutral for a natural product (I save the herbier-scented products for home), and that the tin fits perfectly in my work jacket for a little moisture after frequent hand-washing. I will be replacing my tube of aquaphor in my inbox at work with another tin of this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my least favorite of the Badger line, not easy to spread on to hands.</li>
    <li> It has a pleasant, not too strong, fragrance. It absorbs well, but it is a little difficult to spread. Overall, I like it and I would recommend it.</li>
