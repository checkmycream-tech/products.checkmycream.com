      <li>I also have tried the other two Olay In-Shower Body Lotion formulas and have enjoyed the same wonderful results.</li>
      <li>I am so glad to find someone who not only sells it, but will sell more than one at a time.</li>

      <li>I love this product and when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the local stores, I came to Amazon.com to see if I could get it there.  </li>
      <li>This product works very, very well, as far as I can tell the instructions if followed, makes this a very useful product</li>

      <li>This is such a unique product.  </li>
      <li>This product is becoming harder to find in the stores</li>
      <li>Great product, but so hard to find at our local stores.  </li>
      <li>Now, on the flaky areas when I get out of the shower I still rub a little tiny bit of Shea Butter lotion on top of the Olay, just because I&#x27;m super paranoid.</li>
      <li>I love this in-shower lotion because I usually get very bumpy and itchy after shaving, even while still in the shower.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy sufficating feel either</li>

      <li>In the summer months I don&#x27;t even have to use lotion and as a bonus it leaves a soft hint of glitter on your skin.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your skin so soft...</li>
      <li>just layer this on and let it sit for a few minutes and rinse clean..</li>
      <li>We live in a very dry area of the country &amp; THis product really helps.</li>

      <li>My whole family has to deal with constant dry skin.  </li>
      <li>You just need a small about after you finish washing, smooth it over your body, rinse and pat dry.</li>
      <li>I live in Montana where your skin gets very dry</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 73 years old and my skin is dry.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> All of the olay in shower body lotions are the BEST!  I have very dry skin- in the winter I get flaky patches on my lower back, forearms and shoulders. After a week of use- BAM! gone!!!    NOTHING has ever worked like this for me.     Now, on the flaky areas when I get out of the shower I still rub a little tiny bit of Shea Butter lotion on top of the Olay, just because I&#x27;m super paranoid. But the rest of my body stays VERY supple.    Would recommend to ANYONE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product for years!  I love that it has a hint of sparkle in the lotion so my skin glows when I am done with it.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff because my skin is dry.  It is hard to find it in retail stores so was happy to find it on Amazon.  It is just like a conditioner for your hair but for your skin instead.</li>
    <li> My whole family has to deal with constant dry skin.  This product has been fantastic for us!  It has especially made a difference for my children.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I like that I don&#x27;t feel too greasy after applying this product. It&#x27;s not a heavy sufficating feel either and it smells nice, but not over powering. My skin is improving after only a few uses. I intend to keep using this product as suggested.</li>
    <li> I love this in-shower lotion because I usually get very bumpy and itchy after shaving, even while still in the shower.  This helps sooth my skin immediately and moisturize at the same time.  Plus, it smells great! I don&#x27;t understand why I don&#x27;t see these in the stores anymore!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002DMJM52 Olay In-Shower Body Lotion, Age Defying with VitaNiacin, 15.2 Ounce (Pack of 3)  This is a great product. I have been using it for 7 or 8 years and then earlier this year I was unable to find this product in the store. I went a couple months without it and noticed my skin no longer had that wonderful soft silky feel it had when I used Olay In-Shower Body Lotion. In addition to how great it makes my skin feel it is so easy and quick to use in the shower. You just need a small about after you finish washing, smooth it over your body, rinse and pat dry. I also have tried the other two Olay In-Shower Body Lotion formulas and have enjoyed the same wonderful results. I was so glad when I was able to find this product again.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my winter legs from looking like they have dandruff, &#x27;nuff said.  It smells good too- just enough of a scent without it overpowering my usual April Fresh Downey Fabric Softener allure.  I am not sure about the age defying advertisement, but that is not why I buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect product, and I found it here on Amazon![[ASIN:B000FKEUL0 Olay in-shower Body Lotion, Age Defying with VitaNiacin (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> The Oil of Olay In-Shower Lotion is everything it&#x27;s advertised to be.  After showering and while still in the shower and wet, apply the lotion all of the body.  When you lightly rinse off, it leaves your skin soft and thoroughly moisterized.  This will last from shower to shower.  Not only does it really get the job done, it is easier and more fun to use.  When you towel off, remember to just \\&quot;pat\\&quot; dry your body so you don&#x27;t rub the lotion off onto the towel.  I have used Oil of Olay In-Shower Lotion for over a year and have been so happy with it that I tell all of my friends and family to try it.  I&#x27;m 73 years old and my skin is dry.  This product replenishes it and makes my skin feel like I&#x27;m 23!  Because of my age, I purchase the Age Defying lotion.  They have different kinds so you can buy the lotion best suited for your own skin.</li>
    <li> I live in Montana where your skin gets very dry and this is a Godsend!!!! I use it every day and on the off chance that I forget, I can tell a difference all day - skin feels dry and itchy. I have bought this for 4 friends here in Montana (including guys who don&#x27;t mind or don&#x27;t notice the faint shimmer) and they all LOVE it.  You will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really does help fight dry skin as well as aid with keeping your skin young. Wal Mart won&#x27;t keep it on the shelves, and as always, will order enough to get you hooked on something, then they will quit selling it. I am so glad to find someone who not only sells it, but will sell more than one at a time.</li>
    <li> I get up at 4:30 in the morning and go to the gym to workout.  I use this in the shower every morning then I do not have to take the time to put lotion on.  It is a real time saver!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002DMJM52 Olay In-Shower Body Lotion, Age Defying with VitaNiacin, 15.2 Ounce (Pack of 3)]]This is a very good product and Amazon.com was the only place that I could find it.  Will be ordering more products from you, that are just not in-shower body lotion.  This product works very, very well, as far as I can tell the instructions if followed, makes this a very useful product and it does do what is stated on the bottle.  Your skin feels so soft and the smell is soooo good.  I would voluntary and recommend this product to everyone to use.</li>
    <li> i have long struggled with dry skin, but found baby oil too greasy and lotion right out of the shower too late. This unique product bridges the gap. It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve ever written a company about - asking them to keep making!</li>
    <li> Before I found this lotion, I had dry itchy skin all winter.  I hated regular lotions that meant waiting for them to dry so that I could get dressed.  This is the perfect solution!  Now I use this every day.  No more standing and freezing while I wait for lotion to dry.  I&#x27;m ready to dress as soon as I dry off after a shower.  My skin feels great too!</li>
    <li> Great product, but so hard to find at our local stores.  Thanks Amazon for your market.  I was able to find several things that my husband and I like.  We will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was very glad to find this product online at Amazon.com, because i love it &amp; could no longer find it at any store in my area.  I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to come &amp; it cam within a week. We live in a very dry area of the country &amp; THis product really helps.</li>
    <li> This product has been a lifesaver for me!! My skin is very sensitive to smells and other things, so lotions never really worked for me. Since this in shower conditioner came out I have been using it and my skin has never been better!! It&#x27;s so soft and shiney and you never have to put lotion on again after you shave. It keeps women from getting all those shaving bumps and you just feel so soft. I used to have the driest skin in the world! Now it&#x27;s so perfect. I&#x27;m angry because they have pulled all of these from the stores to bring out all those new smells of in shower wash for Oil Of Olay. What about all of us that love the in shower conditioner? I&#x27;m so grateful that I can still find it at Amazon. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just can&#x27;t enough of Olay and it&#x27;s product line.  Will continue to use when I can afford.  Love, love and love again.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mom for Christmas every year and she is absolutely obsessed with it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is simply wonderful. It is becoming harder to find this product in the local stores...I am trying to find more so I can stock up.</li>
    <li> I love this product: it leaves your skin silky smooth and the more you use it, the better the results.  A lot of stores have stopped carrying it, so I&#x27;m so glad to see that Amazon is still selling it.  I&#x27;ve been a fan since it first came on the market, and just love the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> This lotion really keeps skin hydrated for a long time, close to 24 hours. I have tried numerous lotions for my dry skin(Eucerin, Lubriderm, Aveeno, etc), nothing comes close to this.</li>
    <li> This is such a unique product.  You put it on your skin in the shower and then rinse it off.  It leaves your skin smooth and soft, just as you would expect from Olay and it smells great too.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I have very dry itchy skin but since I&#x27;ve used this I haven&#x27;t had a problem</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I believe in layering moisturizers and this is the first thing I start with.  After you cleanse with soap just layer this on and let it sit for a few minutes and rinse clean.. Leaves your skin so soft...In the summer months I don&#x27;t even have to use lotion and as a bonus it leaves a soft hint of glitter on your skin.  This product is becoming harder to find in the stores so I&#x27;m glad that Amazon offers a 3pack and at a discount if you subsribe and save.  I need to start stocking up on this..buying a 3 pack every month before this product is taken away!</li>
    <li> I love this product and when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the local stores, I came to Amazon.com to see if I could get it there.  I have to have this when I am getting ready for work every day. This product moisturizes my skin so that I do not have dry skin.  I also smells good, but is not an overpowering smell, so I can still wear perfume if I want to.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Easy to use, makes my skin feel great.  If I skip the after shower moisturizer, it&#x27;s no big deal if I&#x27;ve used this stuff in the shower.  Just have trouble finding it around here, so I&#x27;m glad to be able to get it through Amazon.  It makes the shower very slippery for the next person, so be sure to squirt the shower floor with a cleanser of some sort when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else but Oil Of Olay... I love this product...Leaves me soft and it smells really good...Price is right when you order on line...</li>
    <li> we use this product and the other in-shower body lotions Olay makes.  I can&#x27;t imagine getting through a winter without it.  Thank you Olay for making a product that TRULY lives up to its declarations.</li>
    <li> After suffering with dry itchy skin during the winter for decades and trying every lotion on the market, I decided to give this a try three years ago.  It seemed like a miracle.  I&#x27;ve used it ever since and now my mother, who suffered from the same condition swears by this product. I use it every day during the winter and am itch free all day.</li>
