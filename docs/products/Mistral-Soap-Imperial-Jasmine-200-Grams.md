    <li> I love how these soaps smell, especially this jasmine. My one big complaint is that the soaps are not smooth all the way through. As I use them, hard lumps in the soap are exposed. I find using the soap unpleasant. I will not be buying more.</li>
    <li> Again mistral makes such deliciously inviting scented soaps,hands down. I have purchased over six of their select brands since January 2014. Their fragrances are not offending to sensitive noses and non drying after bathing....I just bought another from the Jasmin Imperial line. Set of 2..Great buy..</li>
    <li> this soap smell so good.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the scent of jasmine and it was not easy to find a jasmine soap until I found this one.  I have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> love the way it lathers and the heavenly smell. Definitely will recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> This bar is highly fragranced- beautiful scent of Jasmine.  My whole bathroom smelled wonderful just with the bar sitting in the dish.  Wonderful lather and though I wouldn&#x27;t say moisturizing its not drying either.  I am going to try some other scents!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this jasmine smell, not long lasting as others.</li>
    <li> vetiver is great , so is blackberry , great&lt;br /&gt;scent and these hold their fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;jasmine is great for same reasons.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used the others yet , not dirty&lt;br /&gt;enough .</li>
    <li> VERY NICE SOAP AND LAST A LONG  TIME</li>
    <li> The smell of Jasmine is just sheer perfection.  I will buy again and again.  Love it! Nothing compares, this is the best hands down.</li>
    <li> The product smells so good!</li>
    <li> Long lasting with a wonderful scent. Lots of lather</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the wonderful fragrance of this soap while I&#x27;m using it- and the gentle waft of scent when I walk into the bathroom where I use it. It suds like really good soap, cleanses really great and is such a remarkable pleasure to use. The lilac is just as swoon worthy.</li>
    <li> The soap itself  is terrific but I find the scent not as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;It has a &amp;#34;grandmother&#x27;s toilet water&amp;#34; smell to me but smell is so particular to the individual.&lt;br /&gt;Others giving reviews seem to like it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all Mistral soaps I have tried, it lathers well, rinses cleanly, and does not leave my skin dry.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this fragrance</li>
    <li> Nice, do not know what jasmine smells like but was told after the fact it can be cloying. this has a strong scent but is not overpowering. Also bar last, not whipped full of air like store bought soaps. Bought a couple Mistral Soap and all had nice smells and long lasting.</li>
    <li> With the water in my area, I always have had a problem getting soap to lather. But not with this soap. It lathers easily even in cold water and rinses away cleanly leaving my hands squeaky clean. While the scent of the bar of soap is quite strong, the scent left on my hands is very light. All in all an excellent soap!</li>
    <li> Thank you Mistral LLC for your excellent service</li>
    <li> I really love the fragrances of the Mistral soaps.  The bars are a really large size and seem to last longer than soaps purchased in the market.  I am really glad I tried them and will definitely repurchase Mistral soaps.</li>
