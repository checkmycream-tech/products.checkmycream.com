      <li>i bought different ones along with this one, and i have to say i&#x27;m really impressed .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought many af fierce shopping at Abercrombie.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of Abercrombie and Fitch stores.</li>
      <li>Id be in heaven:)</li>
      <li>I think i will recommend for this one  . :-)</li>
      <li>I just love it..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to be able to afford the stuff, but I just couldn&#x27;t ever justify it in my head.  </li>
      <li>Smelled ok....</li>
      <li>The smell is ok, last a good hour or so, and has a good smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was able to get 2-4 hours of the strong smell before it began to fade.</li>
      <li>Very cool product I must say.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time, smells great, and is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I owned the original one</li>
      <li>Wow this is just an amazing fragrance.</li>
      <li>If you want to see my full thoughts on these body sprays and colognes, check out my review of the Mascolino body</li>
      <li>About 4 good sprays will last you 24 hours.</li>
      <li>This stuff is BETTER than the real fierce, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Not a bad deal considering the price</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a more piercing, vibrant, bright smell than Mascolino, which is more down to earth and warmer in its approach to hitting your olfactory nerves.  </li>
      <li>Power is pretty strong in the smell department.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very strong and smells exactly like the real deal.</li>
      <li>I had one lady asking other people to smell me, lol.</li>
      <li>Its close to Fierce, but fades away quickly (a couple of hours)..</li>
      <li>&quot; body spray smell with it that goes away quickly</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a bit on the strong side so watch how much you spray.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells GREAT!I first smelled it at a Target and was immediately sold on it!</li>
      <li>So worth your money.</li>
      <li>Even though it is not origianl Abercombie and fitch the smell is very close to the original one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure sooner or later</li>
      <li>At first it has that &amp;#34;Canned&amp;#34; Axe type body spray scent, but just seconds after it settled on the skin and started drying</li>
      <li>it has a higher water content so it doesn&#x27;t spot fabrics.</li>
      <li>Pretty close to Abercrombie&#x27;s FIERCE, as they claimed it.</li>
      <li>it was a exact match to A&amp;F Fierce  at 3/4&#x27;s the price.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless, a nice attempt at imitation.</li>
      <li>I stumbled upon this body spray and thought it would be a gimmick, but let me tell you it smells EXACTLY like the real deal.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing that the CHEAP stuff can sometimes be BETTER than the expensive!</li>
      <li>It is available at most retailers like Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreens usually at the $3.99 price.</li>
      <li>Considering a large bottle is $50-$70 you can stock up.</li>
      <li>their series of fragrances really shows how much we just pay for the names of the designer</li>
      <li>/&gt;Let&#x27;s be real with Fierce from A&amp;F.</li>
      <li>Smells like the real thing.</li>
      <li>Very close but don&#x27;t spray to much</li>
      <li>For the fist 6-8 hours you can really tell your wearing it, but it&#x27;s in no way overpowering.</li>
      <li>omg I can&#x27;t stop spraying it on all my clothes, ordering at least 3 more cans very soon!!!</li>
      <li>It gets extremely close to the skin soon after applying, and the result being, people may not be able to smell it on you unless they are in close proximity.    </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the other ones yet, but I love this stuff to death, and I would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
      <li>Just a warning that the body sprays come out much faster than your normal body sprays</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s highly concentrated.  </li>
      <li>Being 92 years of age I can highly recommend this product,  and my son-in-law likes it too.  </li>
      <li>Buy you some NICE cologne for at least $30...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyhow, the Raw Power body spray and cologne are phenomenal.  </li>
      <li>So if you really like this scent, and want massive amounts of compliments, then please stop \\&quot;penny-pinching\\&quot; and buy the real A&amp;F Fierce cologne; you get what you pay for, as the saying goes.    </li>
      <li>This is a very loud and spicy scent.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s strong and doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve ever walked into an A&amp;F store, the first thing you will likely smell is this.  </li>
      <li>Smells like AF and lasts nearly all day.</li>
      <li>Only smells like the real.</li>
      <li>Very similar to other Parfums de Coeur product but with an extra kick :-).</li>
      <li>a long way!&lt;br /&gt;A single spray usually leaves you smelling great for almost the entire day - no need to cover your clothes in it.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent.</li>
      <li>However, them smelling you happens to be a good thing in this case since Raw Power happens to smell like raw awesomeness.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is very inexpensive and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews of all the different body sprays and colognes that Designer Impostors offers, I bought them all since it was still only the cost of maybe two bottles of the real stuff of any one of these</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Only smells like the real. Not really efficient against perspiration. Each spray on the skin reminds a basic deo, it&#x27;s streaming !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be real with Fierce from A&amp;F.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is very potent. A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;A single spray usually leaves you smelling great for almost the entire day - no need to cover your clothes in it.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent.</li>
    <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last that long but it&#x27;s very strong and smells exactly like the real deal.</li>
    <li> We can spray it on our clothes like in anf just like the pros do. It smell 95% alike. Since it&#x27;s not as concentrated as parfum and it&#x27;s a body spray it has a higher water content so it doesn&#x27;t spot fabrics. Considering a large bottle is $50-$70 you can stock up. It&#x27;s a great fierce faux. If only there was a version of hco socal Id be in heaven:)</li>
    <li> At first it has that &amp;#34;Canned&amp;#34; Axe type body spray scent, but just seconds after it settled on the skin and started drying it was a exact match to A&amp;F Fierce  at 3/4&#x27;s the price.  I have already ordered more to stock up on.</li>
    <li> If you want to see my full thoughts on these body sprays and colognes, check out my review of the Mascolino body spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the Raw Power body spray and cologne are phenomenal.  If you&#x27;ve ever walked into an A&amp;F store, the first thing you will likely smell is this.  They spray it all over the place.  I&#x27;ve always wanted to be able to afford the stuff, but I just couldn&#x27;t ever justify it in my head.  Then there came Raw Power.  After reading the reviews of all the different body sprays and colognes that Designer Impostors offers, I bought them all since it was still only the cost of maybe two bottles of the real stuff of any one of these impostors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raw Power is pretty strong in the smell department.  It&#x27;s highly concentrated.  Trust me when I say that people will smell you when you enter their presence.  However, them smelling you happens to be a good thing in this case since Raw Power happens to smell like raw awesomeness.  How do I describe it . . . it&#x27;s a more piercing, vibrant, bright smell than Mascolino, which is more down to earth and warmer in its approach to hitting your olfactory nerves.  I haven&#x27;t tried the other ones yet, but I love this stuff to death, and I would recommend it to anyone.  As for the length of time it lasts, it&#x27;s definitely a good length of time.  It&#x27;s not short or anything.  For me, it lasts for a few days if I spray it on a shirt.  On the skin, I&#x27;d say 6-8 hours.  Just a warning that the body sprays come out much faster than your normal body sprays, so you may want to tone down the length of time you spray compared to a regular body spray.  Also, it burned my armpits for a minute or two when I sprayed them, but it didn&#x27;t last long, nor was it bad enough to warrant me not ever doing that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designer Imposters delivers with these body sprays and colognes.  They&#x27;re definitely everything they claim to be.  Some of the best products I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Very similar to other Parfums de Coeur product but with an extra kick :-). Pretty close to Abercrombie&#x27;s FIERCE, as they claimed it. Very cool product I must say.</li>
    <li> I picked up a can of this at my local Walgreens after reading some of the reviews, and holy crap, this smells like the real deal. Although it has an initial alcohol smell, like the other aerosol sprays, it only lasts for a few seconds and other than that this stuff is legit. No one will know the difference unless they actually work at A&amp;F.</li>
    <li> This body spray smells exactly like A&amp;F Fierce cologne, but do not expect great projection with it.   It gets extremely close to the skin soon after applying, and the result being, people may not be able to smell it on you unless they are in close proximity.    So if you really like this scent, and want massive amounts of compliments, then please stop \\&quot;penny-pinching\\&quot; and buy the real A&amp;F Fierce cologne; you get what you pay for, as the saying goes.    All in all, it does have great longevity, but like I said, it fails to project. For this reason, I am rating this 4 out of 5 stars.   Nevertheless, a nice attempt at imitation. A very nice attempt indeed...</li>
    <li> Fragrance is awesome.. I just love it..&lt;br /&gt;Abercrombie u rock.. I think i will recommend for this one  . :-)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Abercrombie and Fitch stores. After realizing that smell is Fierce, I decided to look for it and discovered that Raw Power, a body spray I actually already have, is a Fierce imposter! After using this spray, and other scents by this brand, I&#x27;d say that the spray is rather strong to me when I&#x27;m wearing it, and is a bit harsh on my throat and nose. I suggest you use it sparingly and spray the majority of it on your back so you you don&#x27;t get a sore throat and headache.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Huge fan of designer impostor colognes! and walmart sells them for like $3 a piece!</li>
    <li> Much better than axe and playboy bs</li>
    <li> It smells just like abercrombie &amp; fitch fierce. i always receive compliments on this cologne and people think it&#x27;s fierce :)</li>
    <li> Even though it is not origianl Abercombie and fitch the smell is very close to the original one. I owned the original one and I couldnt tell the difference and this is way cheaper..</li>
    <li> Its close to Fierce, but fades away quickly (a couple of hours).. Not a bad deal considering the price, I mostly use it before a run and it gets the job done..</li>
    <li> I like this product, but it is just okay in my book. When you initially spay it on you get what I refer to as the &amp;#34;axe smell.&amp;#34; After that smell goes away it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Thsi is the most awesome cologne EVER!    I was looking for Ambercrombie&#x27;s Fierce, which by the way, is 44$, when I stumbled opon this at Target. It&#x27;s a 40$ that smells the same!     I suggest you get it!</li>
    <li> The smell is ok, last a good hour or so, and has a good smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sillage and Longevity is 2/5</li>
    <li> This stuff is BETTER than the real fierce, in my opinion. I bought AC&amp;F Cologne a month age for almost 60.00. It was okay, but when someone told me about this stuff, I ordered 3 cans to see if it was any good. OMG...I get so many compliments!!!! Every where I go, I can see the reaction of people when I come around or pass by. I luagh to myself. I had one lady asking other people to smell me, lol. This stuff is very inexpensive and the smell lasts a long time. It&#x27;s completely worht ordering a few cans. I&#x27;m sure sooner or later, the price is going to be raised. I will EVER buy AC&amp;F for 60.00 again! A waste of my hard earned money! It&#x27;s amazing that the CHEAP stuff can sometimes be BETTER than the expensive!</li>
    <li> VERY STRONG smell.... not worth spending your money on. Buy you some NICE cologne for at least $30... it would be BETTER than this crap.</li>
    <li> This Body spray is amazing. Smells really good and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I buy my Designer Imposters Raw Power Deodorant Body Spray 4 oz. for $2.98 at Walmart.  It lasts a long time, smells great, and is easy to apply.  I use it every morning and again if I&#x27;m going out at night.  People often complement the way it smells.</li>
    <li> it smells great even guys say so</li>
    <li> Wow this is just an amazing fragrance. their series of fragrances really shows how much we just pay for the names of the designer brands smh . i bought different ones along with this one, and i have to say i&#x27;m really impressed . i believe you will be to if you buy this. 11-21-2012</li>
    <li> Smells like AF and lasts nearly all day. The fragrance is a bit on the strong side so watch how much you spray.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells GREAT!I first smelled it at a Target and was immediately sold on it! It smells about as close to Fierce as you can get without buying the actual cologne. For less than $5 a can, you honestly can&#x27;t go wrong especially since 3.4 oz of the Fierce will run you $74 online. As far longevity goes, a little goes a long way, this spray isn&#x27;t like axe, where you can empty half the can on your shirt, and then 2 hours later, you can&#x27;t smell a thing. About 4 good sprays will last you 24 hours. For the fist 6-8 hours you can really tell your wearing it, but it&#x27;s in no way overpowering. All in all it gets a 5/5 from me, for its awesome smell, longevity and the price. You can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Loveeeee it!!!! 💖💖💖 omg!!! So worth your money. I was very skeptical at first but omg I can&#x27;t stop spraying it on all my clothes, ordering at least 3 more cans very soon!!!</li>
    <li> I spray it in my car bc it smells so amazing</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.  If you like Fierce, You will love this one.&lt;br /&gt;Great.  Great.  Great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and it smells just like the cologne that you could purchase from Abercrombie And Fitch Fierce cologne. I was definitely impressed!</li>
    <li> Being 92 years of age I can highly recommend this product,  and my son-in-law likes it too.  And it smells good too!!!!</li>
    <li> Very close but don&#x27;t spray to much it&#x27;s strong and doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I bought this body spray because I absolutely love Fierce cologne. I have bought the cologne over the years as well as using the expensive body wash for the shower. I can&#x27;t get enough of Fierce, that said it is extremely costly and I cannot afford to keep buying A&amp;F Fierce in its multiple forms. I stumbled upon this body spray and thought it would be a gimmick, but let me tell you it smells EXACTLY like the real deal. At an amazing price, I bought a ton of this spray to stock up on because it smells identical to Fierce cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said the only downside of this spray is it does have this \\&quot;axe\\&quot; body spray smell with it that goes away quickly but I cannot describe what that smell is, but all body sprays I&#x27;ve ever used have had this smell. It may have something to do with the higher concentration levels or the spray delivery system itself, not sure. It also does not last the entire day, it sort of mutes itself on your skin until you re-apply. I was able to get 2-4 hours of the strong smell before it began to fade. I have been searching all over the place to find this fragrance in a spray cologne which according to their website, they do make but I cannot find it anywhere in my area. I hope they might sell it on Amazon soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I highly recommend this purchase if you like A&amp;F Fierce cologne but don&#x27;t want to go to their annoying stores or pay the high price for it. It is available at most retailers like Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreens usually at the $3.99 price. Check it out!</li>
    <li> They are Cheap! and are of Good quality! certainly Long lasting!&lt;br /&gt;They are Perfect in this price.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to others.</li>
    <li> Smelled ok....But, didn&#x27;t quiet smell like Fierce and didn&#x27;t last all day. I was a little disappointing considering all the reviews.</li>
    <li> This is a very loud and spicy scent.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smells excellent worth buying.  Walmart sells it for half price.</li>
    <li> Great cologne but target and walmart sell if for like $3 don&#x27;t pay $9 here</li>
    <li> Smells like the real thing. I have both..cologne from A&amp;F and this bottle and I can hardly tell the difference. But it is only $2.98 at walmart. I got it from there and saved a lot of money.</li>
    <li> came on time and was great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many af fierce shopping at Abercrombie.  This smells just like it. Definitely cheaper.  Thank  u</li>
