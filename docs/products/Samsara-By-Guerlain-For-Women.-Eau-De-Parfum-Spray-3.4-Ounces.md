<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not quite how I remember the fragrance of Samsara.  I thought it was a stronger, muskier fragrance.  I still love what it is though.</li>
    <li> I received an authentic EDP.  It lasts well, smells good and just like the sample I got from a reputable perfume vendor.  I&#x27;m happy with this transaction.  The scent is lovely, it&#x27;s strong rather than delicate (noting this because not everyone is into that) and evolves from a very perfumey beginning - sorry, don&#x27;t know how else to describe it - I don&#x27;t like the very top notes but it settles in to a vaguely tropical smelling floral vanilla that plays well with different body lotions, but especially well with mango.  It is not for the faint of heart, and be careful not to overapply.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  This one is the same as all previous purchases.  Hope you will continue to offer it for sale.</li>
    <li> the perfume was older and very strong</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. It was what I was expecting. Smells just as I remembered. This is hard to fine.</li>
    <li> Samsara has been my favorite scent since I first found it at age 19 back in 1990.  I occasionally wear other scents, but this remains my undying favorite.  I always receive compliments when I wear it and I&#x27;ve never tired of it. It is deep and complex scent with a beautiful mystical feeling which always makes me feel sexy and feminine.  I recommend the Eau De Parfum simply because it easily lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Purchashed for my wife. She has gotten alot of compliments on the smell. A very good buy!</li>
    <li> Finally found it after many years of searching. I Love this perfume.</li>
    <li> I drown myself in this before I leave the house in the morning. The sent is gone by Noon or earlier. I went to the mall and sprayed \\&quot;the real thing\\&quot; and the sent lingered through the night.  Why I didn&#x27;t read reviews before purchasing???? I can&#x27;t even return due to shipping flamable restrictions.  Don&#x27;t be fooled. This was a waste of my money!</li>
    <li> I have worn Samsara since 1995, and this bottle, even though it looks as if it is the real item, does NOT have the same wonderful fragrance as my previous bottles, AND the fragrance disappears quickly.  My previous bottle, Eau De Toilette,which is almost empty is much MUCH better.  It is as if the manufacturers have really DILUTED DOWN the product.  It&#x27;s a shame I paid so much for the Eau De PARFUM, maybe I should have bought the much cheaper Eau De TOILETTE, like my previous bottle.  Totally Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED A HUGE BOTTLE OF MY FAVORITE PERFUME... AND &#x27;YES&#x27; IT IS THE REAL THING FOR THE FRACTION OF THE RETAIL PRICE!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! REAL BOX STILL WRAPPED SEALED.. I GET COMMENTS EVERY DAY! IT MAKES A STATEMENT EVERYWHERE I GO...I COULDN&#x27;T&#x27; BE HAPPIER! THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely dissatisfied. I received a fake product, i&#x27;ve owned this parfum many times, bought in Europe, Mexico. Authentic Samasara is so strong that you&#x27;ll smell it on you the next day and in your sheets.</li>
    <li> Great long lasting scent</li>
    <li> I had considerable misgiving about purchasing this fragrance from Amazon after reading some adverse comments about the quality/genuineness of the Samsara Eau de Parfum by another purchaser. My wife who has used Samsara Eau de Parfum for at least the last ten years on a regular basis confirmed that the fragrance was exactly the same as in the bottle she was currently using which I purchased at the duty free shop at London&#x27;s Heathrow airport last year. The packaging of the Samsara Eau de Parfum purchased at Amazon was also exactly the same.  The Samsara Eau de Parfum is available only in select shops. Last week I was traveling through Seoul South Korea and looked for the Samsara Eau de parfum at the Lotte Duty Free Shop at the airport.  Only the Eau de Toilette was available. Need I say more.</li>
    <li> It opens a bit green &amp; citrus, and moves to the ylang ylang before heading straight for business ... powder, violet, powder, rose, powder, orris. Did I say powder? The powder is at the perfect level - not in your face or stiffling. However, the powder is there, changing and morphing, coming to the front, moving to the back, and teasing the senses. It&#x27;s a changeable powder that is a powder lover&#x27;s dream. It dries to a powdery, vanilla, tonka bean, amber on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samsara is not an 1980s powerhouse. It&#x27;s an oriental woody at its finest. Ironically, it seems fresh &amp; unique after the onslaught of edible, aquatic, and happy scents of the last 20 years. I&#x27;ve got the office-appropriate EdT, which is soft and close-wearing - very samsara. I will be adding the EdP to my wardrobe soon. I love it!</li>
    <li> I am so happy that you carry this &amp;#34;hard to find&amp;#34; cologne.  It is a favorite of my mother.  Her birthday is soon, and I know she will love it!l</li>
    <li> This partum smells wonderful and mine was authentic. It lasts all day. It smells just like the partum that I bought at high end departments stores. Everyone asks what are you wearing. They tells me how wonderful I smell.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this perfume and loved it. This bottle I got for Christmas didn&#x27;t smell right. I even had people ask me what I was wearing and comment that it was VERY strong and not in a good way. It smells like a cleaning chemical and not the perfume. Very disappointed. I threw the box away or I would return it.</li>
    <li> Totally not long lasting like the I used to get.&lt;br /&gt;Totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> For many years this was my favorite scent - then it disappeared from all of the stores.  I asked the person at the Guerlain counter why it was discontinued and he sent me to Amazon. Thank goodness I can still get it. I have always received many comments about how good this perfume is on me,  Jane</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom in another state, she loves it. I personally don&#x27;t know what it smells like since i couldn&#x27;t give it to her in person but she was gushing on the phone so it must be good.</li>
    <li> I have been using Samsara for years, and I am never disappointed.  Amazon has the best price around, too.</li>
    <li> If you like sandalwood, this is for you. It&#x27;s so much more complex than just sandalwood, but if you want full on reviews, just go to fragrantica. Lasts a good 6+ hours on me, and not offensive in any way. I&#x27;ve got around 25 perfumes so far and this one is steady growing as a favorite.</li>
    <li> Perfection in a bottle....&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that it might be old, but seems to be fine..&lt;br /&gt;In fact so fine, I bought another bottle.</li>
    <li> I have worn this for many, many years.  The best scent (I was told once) was to be told you smell great, not wow, nice perfume.  Everytime I wear this, I get, \\&quot;God, you smell sooooooooo good\\&quot;  Best compliment I could get.  It&#x27;s just a tad different on everyone due to body chemistry, but the same flavor is consistent.  To feel mysterious and sexy? I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  I&#x27;ve had perfect strangers ask me what I am wearing and that they love the scent.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I get stopped by total strangers, especially men to ask what my fragrance is!  It&#x27;s an oldie, but def. a goldie!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Samsara for several years and recently I have been having trouble finding it in stores. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. I will purchase it again. Everyone who smells it on me just loves it. I do recomend it to others.</li>
    <li> my wifes favourite...mine also</li>
    <li> Love product and I received the product fast.</li>
    <li> Samsara is the only scent that I wear!  It&#x27;s subtle with distinct aromas only found by products by Guelain.&lt;br /&gt;Hints of Sandlewood, jasmine, and rose... mmm so sweet, so heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best prices, and my fragrance arrived super fast!  I only purchase this product from Amazon, because they deliver quickly, and I am a Prime member, so I don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping... Yay!  Best deal around!</li>
    <li> I wore Samsara for years but it&#x27;s a difficult product to find.  Last year I bought a bottle at Macy&#x27;s and it must have been OLD because it smelled awful.  I thought maybe it might be a chemical change in me or a change to the Samsara formula (but that seemed unlikely because they would have made the new formula a new product) and so exchanged the bottle for a different scent.  I&#x27;d really been afraid to try online now because I couldn&#x27;t be certain it wasn&#x27;t as old as the bottle in Macy&#x27;s.  Well, either this is a great vendor or I lucked out but either way, this bottle was the Samsara I remembered.  I&#x27;d recommend taking the chance with this product if you like Samsara because it was a good choice for me.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers! I have wore Samsara for over 15 years. Though I received a real Samsara bottle, the fragrance is not like the real Samsara. The fragrance only lasts a few minutes unlike the real Samsara that lasts for hours. Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> This has been my scent for as long as I can remember.  Have always received complements when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Favorite perfume. Best pricing.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the perfume. It is her favorite scent. Just in time, she only had a few drops left.</li>
    <li> Visited Paris years ago and fell in love with this grown-up scent.  I will always have this perfume in my small collection.</li>
    <li> Love this scent, people always ask me what I am wearing  and say how much they love the way it smells!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome fragrance I have been using it for many years it might be a little expensive but it&#x27;s worth the price and will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing samsara for many years and the last  two purchases don&#x27;t smell the same.  The smell is very faint and I&#x27;m so unhappy that I switched to Laura Mercier.  Something has changed and I wish the old samsara would come back.</li>
    <li> I tend to purchase sweet perfumes: Princess, Euphoria, etc.  When I tried this at Ulta I was totally shocked. It&#x27;s sweet and spicy and yummy.  I only buy perfumes from Amazon because I had a poor experience with what I&#x27;m certain was a fake Coach perfume.  This smells great.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite fragrance. Was happy to get and really enjoying it.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I wanted and for a much better price! It&#x27;s impossible to find this in Eau De Parfum and Amazon had it!</li>
    <li> Always loved this perfume</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> I have used Samsara for nearly 20 years, I love this perfume - however - this is not the same - it says it is - but it is not - it smells of alcohol, it doesn&#x27;t have the fragrence of Samsara.  The real perfume will last all day - giving off hint of fragrance.  This is an imitation or is somehow spoiled.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only fragrance I wear.  I have worn it for more than 10 years and can&#x27;t imagine wearing anything else.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Samsara! I have been using it for many years and couldn&#x27;t find it locally this Christmas or more accurately, I was running out, so I knew if I went to Amazon, I could be sure to find what I was looking for. I was happy with the price and I received my perfume in a timely manner, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I would recommend Samsara to any woman who likes a spicy kind of exotic fragrance. I receive compliments frequently when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Samsara for over 20 years and everytime I wear it someone asks me &amp;#34;What is that beautiful perfume you are wearing?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> mom likes it no! she loves it so thats all that matters!  parfum last longer and smell stronger.  good price</li>
    <li> Once upon a time this was my most favorite scent.  For some reason I experimented with others.  Decided it was time to go back to Samsara and have definitely not been disappointed.  Delicious and so special.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is a classic. I like its floral notes, and they are nicely balanced by a hint of spice. Not a young girl scent, but not a grande dame fragrance either. My wife has stayed with it for a couple of decades, and I&#x27;m onboard.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the complaints from some others .But I&#x27;ve used samsara\\&quot;since 1989 and the bottle I received smells just like it is supposed  to same sensual sexy scent I&#x27;m very satisfied and will reorder again without hesitation★★★★</li>
    <li> Ordered big bottle - I wore this in college about 20 years ago, and loved it. Not quite the scent I remember, a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. Still nice for evenings out, wish I would have ordered the smaller bottle though.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this for his mother as it is the ONLY parfum she wears....found it on Amazon and at a fantastic price!  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST PERFUME EVER! I have been wearing it for years! SUPER FAST SHIPPING TOO!</li>
    <li> I was kind of suspicious to buy this one after reading the other reviews. I do not know about the others but for me this is exactly the same Samsara scent I have always known. In my own experience and observations throughout years being perfume appreciator, I noticed that perfumes, depending on the period of our life, I do not know why, for whatever reason - stress, aging, hormones, temperature - smell slightly different or have less fixation, even if we are using the exact same perfume bought in the exact same store. It happened to me with a couple of them and I was very disappointed because they were perfumes I really loved. With this one though, I got lucky, in my case it stays on for a long time, it&#x27;s the same wonderful and exotic scent, and I get a lot of compliments for the choice. I am very happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> She liked it. Best deal on the internet.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new scent, as I am fond of the rose petal perfumes (Dolce &amp; Gabbana - Rose the One and Vera Wang - Truly Pink).  So I googled \\&quot;powder scented perfume\\&quot; and came across Samsara.  Review after review stated that this is such a wonderful scent, so I ordered it without ever smelling it!  I am so glad that I did!!  Although the smell is very different than what I am used to, it is very engaging, beautiful and warm.  I can&#x27;t stop sniffing myself.  It almost reminds me of Hugo Boss - Deep Red.  Samsara is a great scent and I look forward to enjoying it for years to come.</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL SMELLING, TRUE QUAILTY..ITS REALLY EAU DE PARFUM!</li>
    <li> Great perfume to use. It last all day and I&#x27;ve been using Samsara for more than 20 years.  I highly recommend it. You&#x27;ll get great complement.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance because I have rarely smelled it anywhere. I have worn for a number of years and always have someone ask, what are you wearing, it smells wonderful. And to my surprise, working in a male dominated workforce, both white &amp; blue collar, they always noticed that fragrance.  And love the price I could get thru Amszon. It exceeds for the EDP over $100 in department stores.</li>
    <li> I love this partum it&#x27;smy signature parfum I have been wearing it for overtwenty something years.it&#x27;snice to see I can purchase it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My wife enjoy this perfum. She use it everyday!</li>
    <li> My mom looooooves loves loves it!!</li>
    <li> Product as advertised.  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> All my favorite fragrances are by Guerlain and Samsara is the best.  I always get compliments when I wear it.  Plus Amazon&#x27;s price was more reasonable than the last time I  mde such a purchase.</li>
    <li> im glad amazon carries samsara i love it</li>
    <li> The smell is very persistent, mysterious fragrance, I do not do compliments. I will order again!</li>
    <li> Have been using for years; love it &amp; so does everyone else...</li>
    <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long. I even tried &amp;#34;over doing&amp;#34; it, and it was still difficult to smell.  If I had known this I would have spent my money on something I KNEW lasted.</li>
    <li> Price was perfect! A gift for myself! Delivery time was excellent!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Samsara for 12 years, and always get compliments from people.  It is the only scent I wear.  It is long lasting and smells fabulous.  It is an elegant scent, not overpowering as so many of the newer perfumes can be.  This one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I grew up wearing Samsara. I totally loved it and so hoped that the person who claimed the fragrance quickly faded was wrong. Alas, the truth is that in less than an hour you&#x27;ll never know you sprayed this &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; on you. This is either a knock off or Guerlain has lost their product control. It is NOT worth your money. You&#x27;ll be very disappointed like I am.</li>
    <li> The perfume was too old as I feared it might be.  I ordered vintage perfume from the 80&#x27;s and was hoping that in a dark bottle and unopened it would be OK.  It doesn&#x27;t resemble the perfume I used to wear before they changed the formula.  I took a gamble and lost!!</li>
    <li> I have worn this as my favorite for almost 26 years.  This bottle has no scent at all!  Something is wrong!  Smells like alcohol. Cannot be returned either.  Very disappointed in a product I always loved!  Where can I buy the REAL stuff! This apparently was defective</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter who always wears this fragrance.  Personally I love it too!  People always ask her what she is wearing</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this  amazing product through the Amazon site, and I swear this is the ,&amp;#34;REAL DEAL PEOPLE!!!!&amp;#34;  This PARFUM , is the. OIL based, which means that it&#x27;s not going to just disapate,&#x27;fade away&#x27; right as you all walk the door to go out on your hot and steamy date, due to the  simple fact that this spray is oil based NOT alcohol based which ifbu had chosen the other &amp;#34;toilettte spray&amp;#34; you would be tossing ur money out the window!!  The pricing on Amazon does in fact range from the lowest avaliable to the highest. Just because the pricing may vary on the inter. net doesn&#x27;t mean that you are getting a &#x27;knock off&#x27; product if you chose even the most inexpensive product listed and available at that time. The only thing you need to keep in mind is weather it&#x27;s tolette spray or parfum spray. Either way on here the delivery, the quality and the packaging are all the same from what I&#x27;ve seen!. I laugh at people at Nordstoms and all higher end stores in The mall who think that the price tag listed on the very same thing u just purchased MUST BE  better than anything you could find on line like &#x27;AMAZON&#x27;. TRUTH BE TOLD,  My purchases were delivered directly from the &amp;#34;GUERLAIN&amp;#34; diastributers right here in the USA!!! I received the package the very first day within the window of FREE delivery dates. No damage, no complaints, PURE COMPLIMENTS!!! If I owned the company, I&#x27;d be the person on TV saying if you or your special person in your life don&#x27;t absolutely love it, return it for a full refund, and I&#x27;ll finish it for you!!! LMAO!!! SHOP WISE  MY FIENDS , AND I HOPE THA I HELPED YOU OUT. JUST FOR SHITZZ N GIGGLES I CHECKED MY ORDER , TO COMPAIRE IT  TO AN IN  STORE PURCHASE, AND I GOT MY PARFUM FOR LESS THAN 1/2 OF THE $ THAT IT WOULD HAVE ME ON LINE!!! WHOO HOO !! THAT TOTOALLY MADE MY DAY! WEEK,!! YOUNAME IT I HIGHLY RECOMEND YOU TO PURCHASE WISELY MY FRIENDS !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for over 20 years now. Either Samsara has changed its formula or this is the not the real thing. I sprayed a piece of paper and less than an hour later you could&#x27;t tell I sprayed it. I have to reapply after just one short hour if I want to smell again.I guess I won&#x27;t be buying this anymore</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for 22,years. Great sweet smell, with some cinnamon notes. It&#x27;s The best perfume ever!</li>
    <li> I really liked this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I will recommend this parfum for any woman ... Always have been one of my favorite fragrances .. i love it</li>
    <li> My favorite scent.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife.  She was more that pleased with the surprise.  I know little about perfumes and stuff like these, but my wife does, and she says it is a delicate fragance that suits any occation.</li>
    <li> It is a great perfum, lasts for hours... I just love it. I got it on time. It is worthy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom and wanted to keep it myself!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume&#x27;s gentle yet exotic fragrance...you don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it stays on me all day!</li>
    <li> Sweet. Kind of expensive for wife.</li>
    <li> The price was great and I love the fragrance.  I have been using it for over 20 years and it never disappoints.</li>
    <li> I hope they never discontinue this perfume as i have worn it for twenty years and always get compliments from people.</li>
    <li> I have worn Samsara for years and ran out.  What a good buy this was.</li>
    <li> my favorite fragrance at such an incredible discount. Fast, and reliable shipping!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom not long before she passed away. She had numerous different bottles of scents. Her great granddaughter now has this and loves it.</li>
    <li> What I wanted at a reasonable price and in stock. Amazon is reliable and has products in stock. I went 3 stores in an attempt to shop locally. None in stock no idea when available. Clerks with no knowledge. This turning into an Amazon review. My wife loves this perfume an is not allergic to it so it was a planned purchase not an impulse and we are happy.</li>
    <li> I was given this as a gift for Christmas the bottle is very lovey a deep and sensuous  ruby red color with gold accents, it looks very elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time ever using Samsara the scent when it first goes on is very very very strong, it does mellow out significantly through out the days to a more powerdery soft smell.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume at a good price.  Came in original box and bottle.  Comparable to any Dept store purchase.</li>
    <li> The Best of the Best. Last a long time. Have tried several kinds but none as good as Samsara perfume.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume - it goes so well with my body chemistry.  It is hard to find in stores, though.  The body cream and lotion are my favorites too.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for 20 years. I smelled that fragrance on another lady and she gave me the name and said it was her all time favorite. And it became mine.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for years.  Over the years I&#x27;ve only had one man tell me that he hated it.</li>
    <li> Was wonderful! All as expected!!</li>
    <li> I would never purchase a perfume from Amazon again.  I am sure that they are defects or old or something along those lines. I paid the extra money to get the Eau de parfum, as apposed to the Eau de toilette, because when I last bought this fragrance from a department stor,e I remember it lasting- even until the next day!  Not so with this purchase! It smells different than I remember-just kind of off...and it fades by mid-morning. Sooo it boils down to a very large bottle of  \\&quot;TOILET\\&quot; water.</li>
    <li> As good as I had hoped it to be.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance...  I love it and get compliments on it all the time from women and men alike.</li>
    <li> I used to love this fragrance and almost used up an entire bottle in a yr. Till i stopped going for the heavy smells and stick to fine light fragrances or lotions. But it&#x27;s a great smell for anyone who goes for the heavier scents.</li>
    <li> I´m using Samsara since I was a child. Is one of the different parfums, smells like wood and sandal, very sofisticated!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume...my favorite</li>
    <li> toujours tres satisfaite de ma commande et je renouvelelrai des que j&#x27;aurai besoin..facilite, rapidite et securite , c&#x27;est tres agreable</li>
    <li> This product is mislabeled. It is not Eau de Parfum, or even Eau de Toilette. Now I understand why it has been marked down by 50%.</li>
    <li> My ultimate favorite! Everything was perfect!</li>
    <li> did not smell at all like Samsara. I have bought this parfum from othe stores(macy&amp;#34;s), this one was not even close. Would have returned it if I didn&#x27;t have to go out of the country.</li>
    <li> Iusually wear floral perfumes but I love this fragrance too.  It smells dark and smokey and a little dangerous.  I only wear it in the late autumn and in the wintertime because it&#x27;s quite heavy and just a couple of spritzes are enough for the entire day.  It&#x27;s unusual and was an almost instant classic.  I always have a bottle of the perfume on hand and I move it to the front of my perfume shelf when the summer is officially over.  It&#x27;s my one departure from the floral melange.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to purchase this with all the negative reviews. But the price was too good to pass up. I&#x27;ve been wearing Samsara for over 25 years. This is the real deal. I compared boxes and wrapping and bottles. The scent is exactly what it should be. Very happy. Great buy. Shhhhhhhhhh.</li>
    <li> This perfume has been around for many years and is loved by many women for its amazing smell - not too strong.  Expensive, but worth the money.</li>
    <li> My mother in law LOVES this scent but she has a hard time finding it. I checked on Amazon.... Bingo! Great price and shipped straight to my mother in law.</li>
    <li> Lovely, exactly what I wanted. Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Samsara for over 25 years and it is the same today as it was when I first started using it. Everyone who smells it comments on how wonderful it smells,and wants to know the name of the scent.</li>
