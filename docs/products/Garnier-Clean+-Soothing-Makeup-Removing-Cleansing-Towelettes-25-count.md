    <li> These are very nice clothes, I only deducted 1 star from my review because I thought they were a bit dry. I would just add a little water too them and then they would work fine.

So overall I was satisfied just think they could be a little more moist.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irate my eyes  or skin</li>
    <li> Not helping with the occasional breakouts but I use it mostly for while I&#x27;m at work.  I don&#x27;t always have access to a sink and soap.  I work with animals so being able to wash up quickly goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Not fabulous just fine</li>
