      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the Profectiv Products..</li>
      <li>:) I am looking forward to using this product the rest of my life</li>

      <li>though yes ,it did work wonderfully ssoooooooooo little hair was shedding and breaking ,I love it.</li>

      <li>It definitely makes my hair softer and it&#x27;s a good detangler for coily hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair grow or really strong, but I still love it for moisture in my hair</li>
      <li>I have used while chemically straightened and now as I transition to naturally curly, I am still loving it.</li>

      <li>Absolutely!!</li>
      <li>now i put it in everyday :) and the smell is amazing</li>
      <li>but I love it so far.</li>
      <li>Nooooo, my hair isn&#x27;t extra soft, smooth, good hair, etc.,  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this product for my natural 4C hair.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it after use of it my hair has a soft......</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like to write any reviews on anything s  ,but  I been shedding, breaking so much hair ,I try so many product from high to lows</li>
      <li>all day I comb my hair over and over again no shedding specially in the morning you know how much hairs shed ,but before the shower maybe 2-3 hair was shedding ,I well contuilly use this product ,mega  growth rock......</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>My hair stop falling and it is growing fast!</li>
      <li>In between swims and washes I use it to keep my hair from getting really dry and damaged from the chlorine and its very light in my hair.</li>
      <li>just beautiful black hair that&#x27;s been flat ironed once (going on two weeks now &amp; still looks</li>
      <li>so I mix with water ,and spray on the top hair, leave it dry it</li>
      <li>It is GREAT for twistouts, flat twists, braids and any other protecive hairstyle.</li>
      <li>The only product I don&#x27;t use is the shampoo because it&#x27;s not sulfate free.</li>
      <li>&amp; yes indeed my hair is growing fast</li>
      <li>i haven&#x27;t noticed really any growing yet</li>
      <li>My hair is very coily.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping that this product would work as it said.</li>
      <li>This product has helped my hair so much....</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I transitioned from relaxed hair to natural and finding the right moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t petroleum or mineral-oil based that smelled good was HARD!</li>
      <li>I suggest using on slightly damp hair just to make sure the hair absorbs it.</li>
      <li>but my hair also,i would highly recommend this to any one.</li>
      <li>If you feel you need more moisture you can put a little shea butter or jojoba oil on your hair after you have put this product  in to seal it in.</li>
      <li>I would buy again because my white/native American combination straight, wavy, curly odd hair looks more healthy with use of this product vs other leave in conditioners I use.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many other products, this product defines and mosturizes my hair like no other product I have tried.</li>
      <li>I am new to using this brand</li>
      <li>just what your hair needs to keep it lively and the oils provide what you need to keep the moisture locked in and the hair shiny.</li>
      <li>I ran out of my old jar so I just bought a new one from Amazon with prime shipping (yaay!)</li>
      <li>I first tried the relaxer on my hair (I am mixed) and</li>
      <li>I do not usually write reviews for products, but I had to for this item.</li>
      <li>Overall I saw much less breakage in combing than any product i have ever used (I have used many) and my hair has grown longer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Breakeage - hardly any hair comes out with my comb or brush.&lt;br /&gt;Smell - &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although this stuff is a keeper for my natural hair.</li>
      <li>I had a very thinning hairline, it grew not only my hairline</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impress,but to early to tell I will update on this product soon.</li>
      <li>After using this product my hair COMPLETELY stopped breaking.</li>
      <li>This also does not provide any &#x27;hold&#x27;, just soft hair</li>
      <li>so I decide to get one wet home wash my hair right way to see.  </li>
      <li>Ive been natural for 4 months but did the big chop 2 months ago</li>
      <li>(i have coarse hair) and it makes it feel really soft</li>
      <li>It moisturizes and softens my chemically treated and natural hair equally well.</li>
      <li>Hair is left soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I am an African American woman who has natural hair.</li>
      <li>But not for a person, such as myself who has natural short hair.</li>
      <li>it moisturizes and instantly softens my hair like no other product.  </li>
      <li>ok it was little to heavy for my long hair</li>

<li> I deal with dry hair/skin so with this product alone wont do so</li>
<li> Or totally dry hair on scalp and hair ends.</li>

    <li> moisturizes the hair well</li>
    <li> Finding this product was a Godsend for my hair! I transitioned from relaxed hair to natural and finding the right moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t petroleum or mineral-oil based that smelled good was HARD! But when I happened upon it one day in the store and tried it at home, it worked Amazingly! It leaves your hair soft, moisturized, and smelling good! I put it in before blow-drying for detangling and before roller setting my hair at night. Oh my...I don&#x27;t know WHAT I&#x27;d do without it now that I have it. It&#x27;s a necessity for me now. I recommend this product for those of us who neeeed moisture for hair that demands it!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that this product would work as it said. But unfortunately it did not. However, if you have permed hair, it probably will work for you. But not for a person, such as myself who has natural short hair. I does detangle the hair, but that&#x27;s all it did for me, I did not see any hair growth because of it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to write any reviews on anything s  ,but  I been shedding, breaking so much hair ,I try so many product from high to lows it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t make any different .I went to wartmart I happen to see this product ,they were only $5.00 so I decide to get one wet home wash my hair right way to see.  hardly any hair was breaking .or shedding .(I conditioner with assies most).  I&#x27;m impress,but to early to tell I will update on this product soon. hopelly it will workout for me.  Thank,      update 1-9-15      ok it was little to heavy for my long hair so I mix with water ,and spray on the top hair, leave it dry it little bit comb though yes ,it did work wonderfully ssoooooooooo little hair was shedding and breaking ,I love it. all day I comb my hair over and over again no shedding specially in the morning you know how much hairs shed ,but before the shower maybe 2-3 hair was shedding ,I well contuilly use this product ,mega  growth rock......</li>
    <li> Product smells wonderful and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling to the hair. I use it daily and it dies nourish the hair and helps with hair growth.</li>
    <li> I had a very thinning hairline, it grew not only my hairline but my hair also,i would highly recommend this to any one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn my hair in twist styles for more than 3 years (&amp; loved it) however, decided to flat iron, for a change (did it myself.) I smooth this in my hair every night to keep the shine &amp; moisture &amp;#34;locked in&amp;#34; &amp; by the morning I have &amp;#34;jaw dropping sheen&amp;#34;.................  Nooooo, my hair isn&#x27;t extra soft, smooth, good hair, etc.,  just beautiful black hair that&#x27;s been flat ironed once (going on two weeks now &amp; still looks FAB).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growth?  Absolutely!!, 100% started at my shoulder &amp; is now in the middle of my back (without me tilting my head back.)  In addition, the parts in my hairstyle that were thinning out have now filled in, along with the &amp;#34;temple&amp;#34; area which is growing back beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakeage - hardly any hair comes out with my comb or brush.&lt;br /&gt;Smell - &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency - Thick &amp; Creamy - a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what am I trying to say???...............I&#x27;ve purchased a million &amp; one air products, but this is the one for me!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic for my natural hair! I have tried so many other products, this product defines and mosturizes my hair like no other product I have tried. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work this well considering the packaging seems to be marketed more towards ladies with perms, color-treated hair, or weaves but don&#x27;t let the packaging fool you this stuff does wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it after use of it my hair has a soft......it stays moist, and my hair has grow an inch since I started us three weeks ago</li>
    <li> I love the Profectiv Products.. They are good for my hair. I use all the Profectiv products, perm, shampoo, conditioner and so on.</li>
    <li> it is okay just overpriced</li>
    <li> It has done a LOT for me :) i have very thin hair that i have straightened every single day and almost killed it :/ but using this stuff has cut down the breakage and moisturized my hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as it used to be ! i haven&#x27;t noticed really any growing yet but i have only used it for like a week now i put it in everyday :) and the smell is amazing :) I am looking forward to using this product the rest of my life and i truly recommend this product to everyone  !!</li>
    <li> Well Ive used their cream &amp; lotion, it was just meh! Although this stuff is a keeper for my natural hair. I use this first then top it off with Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil &amp; Im good. I deal with dry hair/skin so with this product alone wont do so the oil is so necessary. Ive been natural for 4 months but did the big chop 2 months ago &amp; yes indeed my hair is growing fast (my hairline is growing back as well). This amazing product, the amazing oil, &amp; an amazing biotin supplement is the reason for growth. Healthier natural hair too! :-)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have used while chemically straightened and now as I transition to naturally curly, I am still loving it. It moisturizes and softens my chemically treated and natural hair equally well. Side note, it does not mix with Eco Styler gel, mixing these two items together will result in white flakes. This also does not provide any &#x27;hold&#x27;, just soft hair</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products, it keeps my hair and scalp in great condition.  I am in a pretty harsh environment at the moment and my hair was getting quite dry and was starting to break off so I ordered the Strengthener and I am so glad I did.  My hair has stopped shedding and breaking and looks great!</li>
    <li> I am faithful to these products, they smell deliciously wonderful packed with great ingredients your hair will love. I ordered 2 containers of this. I also use on my children hair when I french braid or twist their hair. Great moisturizer keeps hair soft. I suggest using on slightly damp hair just to make sure the hair absorbs it. Or totally dry hair on scalp and hair ends. The only product I don&#x27;t use is the shampoo because it&#x27;s not sulfate free. But it&#x27;s a great line regardless.</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, A WHIPPED PRODUCT, LOOKS LIKE IT WONT DO ANYTHING ??</li>
    <li> I had dry, brittle hair that was continuously breaking until I bought this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 days and my hair is softer and stronger - less breakage than I&#x27;ve had in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m AA with color treated relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> This product has helped my hair so much.... I recommend it for relaxed hair.  Your hair grows longer because it reduces breaking drastically. This is very good to keep your hair from breaking too much if you  are overdue for a re-touch. Overall I saw much less breakage in combing than any product i have ever used (I have used many) and my hair has grown longer. The hair is less dry and it does not weight down hair if you don&#x27;t put to much. If you feel you need more moisture you can put a little shea butter or jojoba oil on your hair after you have put this product  in to seal it in. It smells good too and has no mineral oil..and its reasonably  priced too thankfully. My mom and aunt told me about it and I have told my friends about it and everyone loves it!</li>
    <li> I do not usually write reviews for products, but I had to for this item. I had been looking for a product that would moisturize my hair without being heavy or oily. This product moisturizes my hair just right, one of the best products Ive used for moisture. It also defines curls</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman who has natural hair. My hair is very coily. Since I live in Georgia near the beach, styling is difficult due to the humidity here. Not to mention, my hair is prone to frizzing and breaking. My hair was at the beginning stages of breaking. I saw short broken pieces in the shower while washing my hair but no loss in overall length . I was frustrated because every six months I had to cut an inch and a half off of my hair yielding only 3 inches of growth annually. Talk about frustrating!! After using this product my hair COMPLETELY stopped breaking. It is GREAT for twistouts, flat twists, braids and any other protecive hairstyle. It brings out your curl pattern beautifully, defining curls like you would not believe. It&#x27;s water-based- just what your hair needs to keep it lively and the oils provide what you need to keep the moisture locked in and the hair shiny. Plus, the amount of product you get in the jar is enough to last at least 3 months with moderate usage every day. It also refreshens hair styles if you plan to keep for awhile. I use it to revive my two strand twists when I keep them in for up to two months. This product is a Godsend! It smells wonderful, it is nourishing, and lightweight. To add, there is no mineral oil in it so it penetrates deep into the hair shaft. You can even use it as a deep conditioner! Leave it on for 20 minutes, cover your hair with a plastic cap and add heat. Hair is left soft and manageable. To me, it works best on dry hair as a styling product. I LOVE THIS STUFF! Keep in mind that products that claim to stop breakage only do so temporarily- long enough to grow your hair to a preferred length. Then you can cut the damaged hair off. They don&#x27;t permanently repair split hair so plan to cut those ends off, but enjoy your manageable, shiny, curl enhanced hair until you are ready to cut them!</li>
    <li> I am an African American with relaxed hair and I love to swim, but as most of you know our hair and chlorine just don&#x27;t mix well. It became a nuisance to wash my hair all the time and keep it from breaking. In between swims and washes I use it to keep my hair from getting really dry and damaged from the chlorine and its very light in my hair. Also works well during a relaxer to keep from over processing the hair and afterwards to minimize any damage. I ran out of my old jar so I just bought a new one from Amazon with prime shipping (yaay!) I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product for my natural 4C hair. it moisturizes and instantly softens my hair like no other product.  clip your ends then use this daily and your hair will grow. I promise!!!</li>
    <li> I love  mega grow  products. I order more. I recommend to  others.</li>
    <li> Not making my hair grow, but this stuff smells amazing and gives my hair nice texture without greasiness, as long as I use it sparingly. I would buy again because my white/native American combination straight, wavy, curly odd hair looks more healthy with use of this product vs other leave in conditioners I use. My favorite of all.</li>
    <li> I love it. My hair stop falling and it is growing fast! Exactly what I needed. Will be using this forever.</li>
    <li> It definitely makes my hair softer and it&#x27;s a good detangler for coily hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair grow or really strong, but I still love it for moisture in my hair</li>
    <li> i love this i can put it on every day it doesnt make my hair greasy (i have coarse hair) and it makes it feel really soft and i love the smell i just put it in wrap it , get up in the morning comb and go great</li>
    <li> I am new to using this brand but I love it so far.I first tried the relaxer on my hair (I am mixed) and it well the ends still gets curly but I blame the person that did it. I have a very thin patch of hair on the front left side and after using the relaxer i noticed my hair growing so I used all the samples it came with and loved them.&lt;br /&gt;The package had a sample of this and tried it and my my I love it. This moisturizes your hair without that greasy feeling. I will be trying all the products to see what works for me.</li>
