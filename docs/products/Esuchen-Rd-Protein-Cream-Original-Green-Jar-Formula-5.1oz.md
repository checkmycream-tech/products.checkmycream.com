      <li>Works wonderful in my hair and makes it super soft and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair silky smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>and I always thought it was her technique that made my hair so smooth and silky</li>
      <li>To smooth it out I used to use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Shaping Cream after using heat but ever since I&#x27;ve been using this product I haven&#x27;t had to use any sort of smoothing cream.</li>
      <li>Best product ever found to condition hair and provide much needed protein to dry, over-processed hair.  </li>
      <li>Product is well worth price!  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it, especially if you style your hair often of which I have to for work.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it, especially if you style your hair often of which I have to for work.</li>
      <li>First time using this after my perm!  </li>
      <li>Love how it makes your hair silky and soft without being greasy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, I find this product to be 100% worth every dollar.</li>
      <li>it has kept my hair healthy, soft &amp; tamed.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Package came in fast!</li>
      <li>I should buy more and stock enough for life!</li>
      <li>hair is generally healthy but not fully prone to split ends, especially with the use of heat.</li>
      <li>My wife first tried this product after her hairstylist used it on her hair.  </li>
      <li>Shine and very easy to blow dry.</li>
      <li>Good conditioning for my hair but not greasy so stiff at all!</li>
      <li>My coworker who does my hair every month started using this product on herself as she colors it very often &amp; uses lots of heat.</li>
      <li>but it exceeded all my expectations and looks that were already quite high!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>My hair is curly &amp; I like it straight.</li>
      <li>It also does not bother my eyes or skin, as strange as that may sound.  </li>
      <li>My hair is shiny, silky, full of volume and feels terrific!</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
      <li>I highly reccommend.</li>
      <li>my hair came out soft, straight and shiny.</li>
      <li>my hair is normal, and i haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
      <li>Ever since my hairdresser turned me onto it I cannot live without it.</li>
      <li>My hair never, but it never became so soft, silky and treated with any product like this.</li>
      <li>Really puts moisture back in your hair.</li>
      <li>I work at a spa of which also has professional hair stylists.</li>
      <li>After 1 week on this product, my hair was soft and shiny and healthier looking.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair, and usually in the summer the humidity makes it hard to tame, but this product makes my hair gorgeous and healthy.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair very soft, and since I have fine hair and use just a little bit at a time,  a jar will last me a long time...</li>
      <li>Many hair products irratate my eyes due to the heavy scent.  </li>
      <li>I naturally have medium-dark brunette hair with auburn highlights &amp; recently added ash-blonde &amp; ombre highlights to it.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s worth the money...</li>

<li> i didnt need to flat iron...</li>

<li> This one leaves my hair feeling soft and fluffy.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m usually reluctant to try new products as everyone has different hair &amp; skin, just as well as everyone tries to sell their products.</li>
<li> Other leave in products left my hair fizzy and brittle.</li>
<li> I have been using this for my hair for several years and find it difficult to find at a reasonable price.</li>
<li> &amp; I use it every other day (after washing my hair).</li>
<li> I tried this product for several months, and it&#x27;s not better than any cheaper product.</li>
<li> It is the only stay on product that I have ever used that does not leave my hair feeling heavy and limp.  </li>

<li> A little tiny bit is all you need and its lasts for at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
<li> I have long, THICK hair (length is below my bra strap,</li>
<li> i applied this as a leave in and blow dried my hair...</li>
<li> I have thin weak hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My salon uses this product so I tried to find it on line to use daily.  Love it.  People are always commenting on how shiny and heathy my hair looks.  I have thin weak hair so obviously it works!</li>
    <li> Very happy to finally find product available for purchase!  Best product ever found to condition hair and provide much needed protein to dry, over-processed hair.  Great to use on hair after shampoo and before blow-drying or to use for shine after styling. Product is well worth price!  Very pleased with receipt of merchandise - quick delivery and order/delivery follow-up!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser always uses this on my hair and I always thought it was her technique that made my hair so smooth and silky...wrong!  It is this product!!  It makes my hair silky smooth and shiny.  It makes it even easier for me to style my hair.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in two days, great service!!   The leave in is great! Leaves my hair very soft, and since I have fine hair and use just a little bit at a time,  a jar will last me a long time...</li>
    <li> My aunt saw this product in a fashion magazine as one of models&#x27; secrets. Now it is my secret of shiny, soft, and frizz-free hair. I have wavy hair, and usually in the summer the humidity makes it hard to tame, but this product makes my hair gorgeous and healthy. I should buy more and stock enough for life!</li>
    <li> My wife first tried this product after her hairstylist used it on her hair.  It&#x27;s the best protein cream ever;  she&#x27;s in her fifties and has the hair of a twenty-year-old!  She plans to use it forever!</li>

    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I&#x27;m especially pleased to have found it at Amazon.  I received the product quickly and as advertised.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have type 4a hair which is underprocessed and sheds alot. Other leave in products left my hair fizzy and brittle. i applied this as a leave in and blow dried my hair...my hair came out soft, straight and shiny. i didnt need to flat iron...but when i flat ironed....u can just imagine the results.... :-)  love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for 4 years now: the best! Your hair will definitely feel different with it. And it also smells very good. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Ever since my hairdresser turned me onto it I cannot live without it. If I don&#x27;t use it for a couple days I noticed a big difference.</li>

    <li> This is great stuff. I had my hair highlighted last summer, and it was really dry and was breaking. No shine. After 1 week on this product, my hair was soft and shiny and healthier looking. It smells   nice and clean too...kinda like Ivory soap. A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s worth the money...</li>
    <li> 5 stars is not enough to rate this product. It is simply wonderful. I have lots of hair products and excellent and respected brands, but the SH-RD Protein Cream demolishes them all. I am eternally in love with him. I had heard lots of comments about him and was expecting a good performance but it exceeded all my expectations and looks that were already quite high! My hair never, but it never became so soft, silky and treated with any product like this. He is by far the best thing I bought. Never gonna let it lacks. I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. After using 3 times, I could see the difference in my hair. Shine and very easy to blow dry. I totally recommend</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
    <li> Great product! First time using this after my perm!  Absolutely love it!  Good conditioning for my hair but not greasy so stiff at all! Even my daughter is using it now to take care of her hair because she swims 6 times a week. She loves it too.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair feel amazing.  My hairdresser no longer carries it so I was thrilled to find it online at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I work at a spa of which also has professional hair stylists. My coworker who does my hair every month started using this product on herself as she colors it very often &amp; uses lots of heat. I&#x27;m usually reluctant to try new products as everyone has different hair &amp; skin, just as well as everyone tries to sell their products. Anyway, she is a trusted coworker &amp; after seeing how her hair hasn&#x27;t frayed even with her constant recoloring &amp; use of heat (blowdrying &amp; curling), I bought the product. She has used it on my hair when she cuts &amp; color it. I naturally have medium-dark brunette hair with auburn highlights &amp; recently added ash-blonde &amp; ombre highlights to it. Lightening your hair causes some damage but I have been using this product since &amp; it has kept my hair healthy, soft &amp; tamed. I started curling my hair more often as when I straighten it, the highlights peek out like split ends (peek-a-boo highlights) &amp; appear unhealthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is generally healthy but not fully prone to split ends, especially with the use of heat. Now another factor for some can be,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I find this product to be 100% worth every dollar. I have long, THICK hair (length is below my bra strap, sorry if this is TMI for you). The 5.1 oz. jar lasted me over two months &amp; I use it every other day (after washing my hair). You can always think about it as $1 a day. Another beauty about this product is usually, even with healthy hair, my high-heated flat iron &amp; curling iron usually makes the ends of my hair look frayed &amp; feel almost crunchy. To smooth it out I used to use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Shaping Cream after using heat but ever since I&#x27;ve been using this product I haven&#x27;t had to use any sort of smoothing cream. The ends of my hair are just as healthy as the root. But since the product makes my hair so smooth/ sleek the only extra product I need is, yours truly, hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;ONE MORE BENEFIT, I have humidity hair spray (JONATHAN PRODUCT IB SHIELD HUMIDITY LOCK-OUT SHINE SPRAY ). Haven&#x27;t had to use it once since picking this product up. It even locks out humidity BUT I haven&#x27;t been to the beach, that may be a different story.&lt;br /&gt;Hope you try this, good luck! I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it, especially if you style your hair often of which I have to for work.DITY LOCK-OUT SHINE SPRAY ). Haven&#x27;t had to use it once since picking this product up.

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it, especially if you style your hair often of which I have to for work.</li>
    <li> As a middle-aged woman (yikes), anything that gives my hair some extra life and youth is wonderful! This product is IT! Recommended to me by my stylist cousin, just the smallest dab massaged into my hair after towel drying gives me the best results I have ever experienced. My hair is shiny, silky, full of volume and feels terrific! And because you only use a tiny bit, the jar lasts quite a long time. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> It works well in my hair &amp; that is saying a lot. My hair is curly &amp; I like it straight.</li>
    <li> You can feel the difference instantly with this product! No need to wait a week and see the results. Will never stop buying it. It&#x27; truly fantastic!</li>
    <li> Package came in fast! I love this product. Works wonderful in my hair and makes it super soft and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Delivered on time, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
    <li> Really puts moisture back in your hair. My daughter  is  a  swimmer and the chlorine  dries out her hair. She uses this a couple  of  times  a  week.</li>
