      <li>This is a great color!</li>
      <li>The color is awesome too!</li>
      <li>&lt;3 Gelish!</li>
      <li>It is very bright</li>
      <li>so I feel like it is a very good value.  </li>
      <li>I tried putting on 4 coats of this by itself but it still did not look very good on</li>
      <li>Looks great on all skin tones, but best when 2-3 coats are applied!</li>
      <li>All five of the colors I ordered were delivered promptly, packaged well, and turned out great.</li>
      <li>and I was completely happy.</li>
      <li>I like the quality of this product and they have a great color selection</li>
      <li>It is transparent and needed 3 layers to look great.</li>
      <li>Two coats with no base color and the best you can call it is a tint.</li>
      <li>Good product for the money.  </li>
      <li>Love the color and lasts me for weeks!</li>
      <li>This is a really cute color though!</li>
      <li>Definitely a good buy, great color, and worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Nice color.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE gel polish!</li>
      <li>I am a big Gelish polish buyer, and this one is another excellent color.  </li>
      <li>I am absolutely in love with this color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more into shimmer polishes</li>
      <li>Gelish is one of the best gel polishes out there, but it is cheaper than OPI and some of the other designer brands, but it works better than they do!</li>
      <li>This color is so girly and cute.  </li>
      <li>This color looks better in the bottle than on me.</li>
      <li>I used June Bride over it and it makes it better.</li>
      <li>An added bonus is that the price is better here on amazon than it is in the beauty supply stores.</li>
      <li>Love it ...</li>
      <li>This is a great color, and a nice staple if you want a pink in your collection.  </li>
      <li>i strongly suggest that those buying any gelish colors online take the time to google image</li>
      <li>It is a nice moderately bright pink glitter polish that you can stack to make darker.  </li>
      <li>whatever shade they might be interested in to get a better idea of what it will look like once applied.</li>
      <li>I was sooo excited to get this color</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been in love with the Gelish brand since September when I first purchased the set and UV lamp from Sally Beauty Supply.  </li>
      <li>I love this color, it&#x27;s nice and simple but still fancy.</li>
      <li>Overall nice color, but not my favorite.</li>
      <li>Its super easy to apply and WELL worth the cost.</li>
      <li>The color is awesome and I love that the size is bigger than what I have been getting at other places and you guys have it for a cheaper price.</li>
      <li>I think it would look nice on anyone really, but sometimes us clear people can look washed out easily.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty color *</li>
      <li>Very pretty color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
      <li>It is a nice color, I just like my polishes more vibrant and usually only like to do two coats.</li>
      <li>Will DEFINITELY order again and again, thanks so much for the great deal!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very sheer and may be nice over another color.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t mine the led light and love how this last up to two weeks and maybe longer....</li>
      <li>Though there is enough glitter and pigment to layer nicely over another color.</li>
      <li>but it is a fun color.  </li>
      <li>Another thing I wasn&#x27;t aware of was that this was a FULL sized polish.  </li>
      <li>Was nervous to order online because I&#x27;ve heard nightmares of people buying Gelish that didn&#x27;t cure right from online stores.</li>
      <li>Very sparkly, just how I like it!  </li>
      <li>This polish is a nice pink color.  </li>
      <li>The package got there faster than scheduled and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>I first tried it by itself.</li>
      <li>I am used to the \\&quot;Gelish Mini\\&quot; sets from Sally&#x27;s, which actually ends up costing the same or MORE than what a full sized bottle costs on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>I have very pale skin, cool undertones, and this looks nice on me.  </li>
      <li>The only drawback I found was that it looks best with 3 coats, not really that big of a deal when it dries so fast.</li>
      <li>I would NOT recommend this product for anyone who wants quality.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast with no issues</li>
      <li>Reviews said this was much lighter than the picture</li>
      <li>Color nice, arrived in time, but although i have not complained to seller, the bottle had polish all around the base/ rim if bottle, i would say it had previously been opened or used,</li>
      <li>I have dark streaks underneth my nails that needs to be covered better.</li>
      <li>I also appreciated being able to see the colors on actual nails, as the colors look completely different on the bottle than when painted on.  </li>
      <li>If you are interested in half a dozen coats, this polish is very pretty for all others, please avoid.</li>
      <li>It is pretty but a bit sheer.</li>
      <li>but when I used it, the color was pretty sheer.</li>
      <li>i guess, i should of complained but its not end of world and have more things to worry about than that.</li>
      <li>this is a pretty pink glittery polish.</li>
      <li>I have priced this nail polish at other places and it has been much higher.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a solid pink, but more like a glittery sheer pink!</li>
      <li>did I know that Amazon would have such an amazing selection of Gelish colors that I was unable to find in stores.  </li>
      <li>I bought this color hoping that it would be an intense glitter, but it&#x27;s a very sheer pink.  </li>
      <li>This color is melon colored pink with sparkles but was a little more sheer than I expected.</li>
      <li>I have more than 30 gelish colors and this one is the 2nd least favorate that comes after the neon yellow ( don&#x27;t even remember the name of it).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of pink color</li>

<li> It did take much longer to cure than clear coat and other colors I have done in the past.</li>
<li> The next time I used a soft pink base coat and it still took three coats to get a good show of color.</li>
<li> Last a long time too!</li>
<li> so I feel a little sophmoric wearing it to my professional job</li>
<li> and therefore two coats are enough for the shade of pink I wanted.  </li>
<li> This particular one goes extremely well with my very pale skin and will be a regular in my nail polish rotation.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other colors that I have and starts to get dingy</li>
<li> The only problem for me personally has been the darker purple glitter that seem to be few</li>
<li> I thought this would be a deeper shade of pink with glitter.</li>
<li> It has a shear pink under tone with small gold and pink sparkles and bigger purple sparkles throughout.</li>
<li> but this will do for now until I test some other colors.</li>
<li> Like with other gelish colors i&#x27;ve tried, it takes three coats to get the desired effect.</li>

<li> On the fourth coat out of frustration, my wife ended up glob-ing it on so thick that her nails were lumpy and uneven.</li>
<li> so when I wear it I have to change the color about a week and a half after.</li>
<li> but* this polish is so thin that even after three coats it is barely noticeable.</li>
<li> I was not sure what to expect because it is hard to tell what color it actually is in the picture.  </li>
<li> I put in three coats to try and get the color a little darker.</li>
<li> Little</li>
<li> Only problem with glitter polish is it&#x27;s hard to apply (myself) in thin, even coats.  </li>
<li> Very little glitter too.</li>
<li> It would cost me at least $30 at the salon.</li>
<li> and I see what they mean</li>
<li> as usual harmony gel has to be applied thin.</li>
<li> The polish itself is somewhat thin and runny.  </li>
<li> This polish is HORRIBLE, it does not stay on as the description claims, although I am using a PH Bond, Gelfish Base coat, and Gelfish Top coat.</li>

    <li> This polish is a nice pink color.  I was not sure what to expect because it is hard to tell what color it actually is in the picture.  When I first opened the bottle I thought the color would be too pink (dark).  After applying it I realized the color is rather sheer and therefore two coats are enough for the shade of pink I wanted.  Keep in mind this is a \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; polish.  I&#x27;m more into shimmer polishes but this will do for now until I test some other colors.</li>
    <li> I have more than 30 gelish colors and this one is the 2nd least favorate that comes after the neon yellow ( don&#x27;t even remember the name of it).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of pink color but this one is just ugly to me!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it;s just me...</li>
    <li> The package got there faster than scheduled and it was exactly what I ordered. Gelish is one of the best gel polishes out there, but it is cheaper than OPI and some of the other designer brands, but it works better than they do!</li>
    <li> This color is melon colored pink with sparkles but was a little more sheer than I expected. I put in three coats to try and get the color a little darker. It is a nice color, I just like my polishes more vibrant and usually only like to do two coats. Overall nice color, but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love this color, it&#x27;s nice and simple but still fancy. Shipped fast with no issues and I was completely happy.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a deeper shade of pink with glitter. It is very sheer and may be nice over another color. I would not have ordered if I thought it would be see thru. I have dark streaks underneth my nails that needs to be covered better.</li>
    <li> I bought this color hoping that it would be an intense glitter, but it&#x27;s a very sheer pink.  I had to use three coats to get an opacity that I could stand.  It&#x27;s very pretty but I think that I will use it over another color from now on.</li>
    <li> This color looks better in the bottle than on me. It is pretty but a bit sheer. I used June Bride over it and it makes it better.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money.  I have priced this nail polish at other places and it has been much higher. I will buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I first tried it by itself. Two coats with no base color and the best you can call it is a tint. The next time I used a soft pink base coat and it still took three coats to get a good show of color. Very little glitter too. This one&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> The color is awesome and I love that the size is bigger than what I have been getting at other places and you guys have it for a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with the Gelish brand since September when I first purchased the set and UV lamp from Sally Beauty Supply.  Little did I know that Amazon would have such an amazing selection of Gelish colors that I was unable to find in stores.  I also appreciated being able to see the colors on actual nails, as the colors look completely different on the bottle than when painted on.  Another thing I wasn&#x27;t aware of was that this was a FULL sized polish.

Definitely a good buy, great color, and worth every penny.  &lt;3 Gelish!</li>
    <li> Very pretty color. Last a long time too!</li>
    <li> Very pretty color *but* this polish is so thin that even after three coats it is barely noticeable. On the fourth coat out of frustration, my wife ended up glob-ing it on so thick that her nails were lumpy and uneven. If you are interested in half a dozen coats, this polish is very pretty for all others, please avoid.</li>
    <li> Reviews said this was much lighter than the picture and I see what they mean but with two somewhat thick coats, I have a very similar color to the picture.  The polish itself is somewhat thin and runny.  After reading reviews, I was prepared to have to add a color under it but found I did not need to.  It is very bright so I feel a little sophmoric wearing it to my professional job but it is a fun color.  This bottle is twice the size of the Shellac brand so I feel like it is a very good value.  It did take much longer to cure than clear coat and other colors I have done in the past.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this color. i strongly suggest that those buying any gelish colors online take the time to google image whatever shade they might be interested in to get a better idea of what it will look like once applied. This particular one goes extremely well with my very pale skin and will be a regular in my nail polish rotation. Like with other gelish colors i&#x27;ve tried, it takes three coats to get the desired effect. Though there is enough glitter and pigment to layer nicely over another color. An added bonus is that the price is better here on amazon than it is in the beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE gel polish! The color is awesome too! This stuff stays on for 10-14 days! Its super easy to apply and WELL worth the cost. It would cost me at least $30 at the salon.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments on this color.  Very sparkly, just how I like it!  I have very pale skin, cool undertones, and this looks nice on me.  I think it would look nice on anyone really, but sometimes us clear people can look washed out easily.  This is a great color, and a nice staple if you want a pink in your collection.  It&#x27;s got glitter, so be prepared for that!</li>
    <li> Love the color and lasts me for weeks! If you like shimmery then this is the nail polish for you!</li>
    <li> This polish is HORRIBLE, it does not stay on as the description claims, although I am using a PH Bond, Gelfish Base coat, and Gelfish Top coat. I requested a return, and was denied. I have had NO problems with the CND shellac polish. I would NOT recommend this product for anyone who wants quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great color! It&#x27;s not a solid pink, but more like a glittery sheer pink! Looks great on all skin tones, but best when 2-3 coats are applied!</li>
    <li> This color is so girly and cute.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other colors that I have and starts to get dingy so when I wear it I have to change the color about a week and a half after.</li>
    <li> Only problem with glitter polish is it&#x27;s hard to apply (myself) in thin, even coats.  This is a really cute color though!</li>
    <li> I like the quality of this product and they have a great color selection and I don&#x27;t mine the led light and love how this last up to two weeks and maybe longer.... Love it ... I don&#x27;t like how you have to soak your nails in acetone that eats up my skin and my skin starts to peel so I had to stop using it for that reason...</li>
    <li> Nice color.  Somewhat subdued and a bit transparent but I like this one especially if my nails are short. I&#x27;d buy this color again.</li>
    <li> Color nice, arrived in time, but although i have not complained to seller, the bottle had polish all around the base/ rim if bottle, i would say it had previously been opened or used, just unlucky i guess, i should of complained but its not end of world and have more things to worry about than that.</li>
    <li> This color is one of my favorites.  It has a shear pink under tone with small gold and pink sparkles and bigger purple sparkles throughout.</li>
    <li> I was sooo excited to get this color but when I used it, the color was pretty sheer. It should be used over a solid color. I tried putting on 4 coats of this by itself but it still did not look very good on it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> It is a nice moderately bright pink glitter polish that you can stack to make darker.  The only problem for me personally has been the darker purple glitter that seem to be few and so I end up with like 3-4 per nail.</li>
    <li> I am a big Gelish polish buyer, and this one is another excellent color.  The only drawback I found was that it looks best with 3 coats, not really that big of a deal when it dries so fast.</li>
    <li> All five of the colors I ordered were delivered promptly, packaged well, and turned out great. Was nervous to order online because I&#x27;ve heard nightmares of people buying Gelish that didn&#x27;t cure right from online stores. Not the case here, the product is Salon quality as promised. Will DEFINITELY order again and again, thanks so much for the great deal!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.- unless you have a salon card, the only place open to the public to purchase is Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply where they are $13.99 for only a 3rd of the size!! YOU CANT beat this price!!!</li>
    <li> as usual harmony gel has to be applied thin. this is a pretty pink glittery polish. It is transparent and needed 3 layers to look great.</li>
