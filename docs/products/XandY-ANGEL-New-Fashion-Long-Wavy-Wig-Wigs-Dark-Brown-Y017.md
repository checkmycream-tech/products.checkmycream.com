      <li>A fantastic wig for the price!</li>
      <li>Very natural looking with a beautiful cut, which is not shown in photo.</li>
      <li>love its hair style, but the hair comes too easily.</li>
      <li>The wig itself is a very nice natural color, which can make a world of difference.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to take care of.</li>
      <li>The bangs needed some trimming, but otherwise I barely had to do anything to it at all to make it look great on me.</li>
      <li>Take it down when you get to your destination and check a mirror to perfect it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more curly than wavy, but it&#x27;s very very pretty.</li>
      <li>with no tracking details theres a huge risk</li>
      <li>Theres a brush for wigs and its great since youll end up pulling out alot of hair brushing with a regular brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>silky feel, comes with the wig cap, the color is true and is easy to wear.</li>
      <li>Great quality wig, can&#x27;t tell when on that its not real.</li>
      <li>As seen and true to color.</li>
      <li>I am not sure how many times I could wear it, but good quality as comparing to its price</li>
      <li>I was not in love with the cut of the wig but somthing that can be fixed.</li>
      <li>I really love this wig, it arrived super early and looks very realistic.</li>
      <li>Very long, which was nice.</li>
      <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t been easy to straighten</li>
      <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Get</li>
      <li>Overall, Ok for the price..</li>
      <li>The wig is pretty.</li>
      <li>Most likely go shorter.</li>
      <li>And, I love the fact that it can be styled with heat (at a low setting).</li>
      <li>but I was able to run my straightener on it using low heat</li>
      <li>/&gt;&amp;#62;Obviously sewing in clips was great, I wanted the extra security and have enough real hair to grip onto..&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Braid or gently twist into a bun if you are walking somewhere.</li>
      <li>This is a nice wig, fits comfortably, but it probably won&#x27;t last long after a couple of wears.</li>
      <li>Great for a single wear, but even the most delicate care will cause it to fall apart.</li>
      <li>The wig is pretty, but it doesn&#x27;t really look like the one in the picture.</li>
      <li>even tell!&lt;br /&gt;It does feel real</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold much heat</li>
      <li>Looks and feels like real hair.</li>
      <li>and it works really well.</li>
      <li>she will love it, also she is good at cutting hair.</li>
      <li>So pretty and soft.</li>
      <li>shipping was decent.</li>
      <li>checking out some of their other colors right now!!</li>
      <li>It is also much thicker than I thought, not to mention soft.</li>
      <li>So far I like the wig I haven&#x27;t styled it too much yet</li>
      <li>It is definitely well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little shiny, so it might not look great for everyday wear, but I purchased this for a costume</li>
      <li>Not easy to brush or put on, and the styling wasn&#x27;t quite like in the picture,  more of a natural curl.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m naturally blonde)&lt;br /&gt;Awesome brown locks!</li>
      <li>The bangs are a bit long, but are pre-cut and you can just trim them to make them the right length.</li>
      <li>This wig looks really natural.</li>
      <li>It actually looks real too.</li>
      <li>The wig is nice but is slightly thin.</li>
      <li>The only down part is that it tangles easy but can be combed out.</li>
      <li>The wig itself is pretty small, but I have a large head</li>
      <li>curls are cute though, and overall it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s about to fall apart that quickly, like some less expensive wigs.</li>

    <li> The wig is pretty. too long for me. I thought about cutting it myself because I love the color. I am going to give it to my daughter she will love it, also she is good at cutting hair. Wish she were here with me.. then I can keep it for myself</li>
    <li> The wig is nice but is slightly thin. The color is perfect and the wig looks natural.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels like real hair.</li>
    <li> Nice color, good quality , and came on time!!:)</li>
    <li> The wig is pretty, but it doesn&#x27;t really look like the one in the picture.</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected. Shiny, but not like a halloween store wig. The bangs are a bit long, but are pre-cut and you can just trim them to make them the right length. Comes like the picture.</li>
    <li> This wig came in just in time, I was starting to get worried.&lt;br /&gt;Really silky feel, comes with the wig cap, the color is true and is easy to wear. The length is long as in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is perfect! It&#x27;s a little shiny but nothing a little hair spray can&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like a bad ass with brown hair (I&#x27;m naturally blonde)&lt;br /&gt;Awesome brown locks!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice wig as always from this company. Shed very little. The only down part is that it tangles easy but can be combed out. Only wish it comes in black.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the wrong color and looks nothing like the picture.... i would give it five stars if the color was right because it is absolutely beautiful... just dont like the color</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you paid for. Looks nothing like the picture. Disappointed. Oh well I&#x27;m going to try to fix it. Most likely go shorter.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! Cut my dreads off and as my hair is growing out, itslooking quite ridiculous! I sewed on some clips to the wig and wore it out today and everyone loves it (: strangers cant even tell!&lt;br /&gt;It does feel real but I have a wig brush and have been careful not to tangle it (lesson learned)&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Obviously sewing in clips was great, I wanted the extra security and have enough real hair to grip onto..&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Braid or gently twist into a bun if you are walking somewhere. Take it down when you get to your destination and check a mirror to perfect it. Its so beautiful down!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;check mirrors often to make sure its secure! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Get the brush! Theres a brush for wigs and its great since youll end up pulling out alot of hair brushing with a regular brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im checking out some of their other colors right now!! Repeat customer for sure&lt;br /&gt;(Expected delivery was sept 1 and I got it aug 20.. which is great but with no tracking details theres a huge risk it could&#x27;ve been stolen!I guess keep an eye out for the mailman!? )</li>
    <li> This wig looks really natural. But it&#x27;s shorter than I thought.</li>
    <li> Nice color. Very natural looking with a beautiful cut, which is not shown in photo. It looks much better than photo.</li>
    <li> A fantastic wig for the price! It&#x27;s a little shiny, so it might not look great for everyday wear, but I purchased this for a costume and it was absolutely perfect. The bangs needed some trimming, but otherwise I barely had to do anything to it at all to make it look great on me.</li>

It has a very nice styling to it that is not in the picture. It&#x27;s more curly than wavy, but it&#x27;s very very pretty. And, I love the fact that it can be styled with heat (at a low setting). Overall, it has everything I look for in a wig.</li>
    <li> bangs are way longer than pic portrays, by a good inch or more. curls are cute though, and overall it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s about to fall apart that quickly, like some less expensive wigs. shipping was decent.</li>
    <li> Very long, which was nice. Not easy to brush or put on, and the styling wasn&#x27;t quite like in the picture,  more of a natural curl. So far it hasn&#x27;t been easy to straighten</li>
    <li> I really love this wig, it arrived super early and looks very realistic. I posted a picture of myself with it on Instagram and people thought I had gotten a haircut because I don&#x27;t have bangs. As said in other reviews, it is a bit shiny but that&#x27;s to be expected and it&#x27;s easy to take care of.</li>
    <li> Really great wig. Bangs don&#x27;t need trimming or anything. Doesn&#x27;t hold much heat but I was able to run my straightener on it using low heat and it works really well. The wig itself is pretty small, but I have a large head so it was expected. Great product; can&#x27;t wait to use it for a lolita coord and at school.</li>
    <li> This wig is well made, beautiful, and adjustable. It actually looks real too. I will be ordering another. It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> This wig is an auburn redish brown, not at all like the dark brown in the picture. I needed it for a cosplay so it&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is a nice wig, fits comfortably, but it probably won&#x27;t last long after a couple of wears. Overall, Ok for the price..</li>
    <li> love its hair style, but the hair comes too easily. I am not sure how many times I could wear it, but good quality as comparing to its price</li>
    <li> Looks great. . Very natural long and thick</li>
    <li> This wig is whisp thin. Great for a single wear, but even the most delicate care will cause it to fall apart.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s curly than in the picture and also thicker, the color is spot on though. It was also a little shiny but adding baby powder takes out the shine a lot. So far I like the wig I haven&#x27;t styled it too much yet but I plan to cut a fringe into it.</li>
