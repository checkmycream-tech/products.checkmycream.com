    <li> This product was excellent. It was still in the plastic wrap like it had come from the store. I was very pleased with the honesty of the seller. I would definitely buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I was hunting for this all over town. I had one in reserve for when I had finished what I was using. When I opened my reserve supply, it had spoiled (I had never had that happen before). Ulta said they hadn&#x27;t carried it in years. I was really crushed because this is my go-to Spring/Summer fragrance. The customer service rep at Ulta suggested I try the manufacturers website or Amazon..duh. Bingo! Fast and fabulous.</li>
    <li> My wife loved getting this as a Christmas gift</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume since I was a sophomore in high school in the late 90&#x27;s. It was my signature scent. I have used other perfumes since, but this is the one that my husband likes the best. He, as well as others who smell this scent on another woman say that when they smell it, they think of me. I was excited to get two large bottles for Christmas a couple of years ago, but when they ran out, I was unable to find more. Thank goodness its still online. I will be using this fragrance for years to come. There is no musk to this perfume, which is a main reason I like it so much. Its very clean and floral. Its not too heavy or overpowering, no matter how much you apply. This is a great purchase!!</li>
    <li> The price was unbelievable and it came in record time. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have not bought this perfume from Amazon (yet) but I will when my current bottle is about to get over. This is my second bottle and I love it! It&#x27;s such a beautiful fragrance - light and fresh, brings Spring and Summer to mind. It never fails to lift my mood when I use it. It&#x27;s a decent price for a wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with Sunflowers.  I love Elizabeth Arden!!  This has a nice floral fragrance, not too overpowering.  It does not stay with me too long, however.  That is the only problem.  Otherwise, I still love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. And love it. Love to have some discount coupons for the next purchase. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Packaged nicely and new!  My mom loves this perfume, and for it being an older scent it still smells good to me also!</li>
    <li> Very speedy delivery, l&#x27;m very pleased with the product and the price and will order again from this provider.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes. This product is the real deal. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price anywhere and it was shipped very quickly. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells on my wife. It also makes me itchy, my eyes burn, and of course, tastes funny.</li>
    <li> But it does not last long that is my disappointment! I come from a premise once you spray you should be good foe the day.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product Very Good</li>
    <li> Love it! Been using it for years. This perfume is good for all ages it lasts all day ;-). I daughter also loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance since it 1st came out in the 90&#x27;s &amp; continue 2 wear it...2 this day ppl still complement me &amp; ask what I&#x27;m wearing...I wear this fragrance in spring &amp; summer bcuz it smells just like a beautiful sunny spring or summer day...flowery fresh &amp; clean!</li>
    <li> My favorite scent- not to heavy but enough there to be noticed. I am often told &#x27;I smell nice&#x27; :)</li>
