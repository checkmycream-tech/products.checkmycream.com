      <li>Was glad to find some.</li>
      <li>LOVE it.</li>
      <li>sanitizer is pretty good, though I sure as heck wouldn&#x27;t pay anything close to the 40 dollars</li>
      <li>The scent is wonderful and not chemically like other sanitizers.</li>
      <li>Easy to spray/rub on and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
      <li>I find that to be true for most brands, though.</li>
      <li>If you just need something to sit on your desk, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent and, more importantly, does not dry out your hands like some sanitizers do.</li>
      <li>During flu season I wanted something triclosan and propylene glycol free that would help kill germs.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for anyone but especially moms.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fresh scent, so it doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol, as most others do.</li>
      <li>Bought these for cruise to help keep kids hands clean.</li>
      <li>No chemical smell and gets your hands clean.  </li>
      <li>use Burt&#x27;s Aloe &amp; Witch Hazel as my regular hand sanitizer &#x27;cause it is much more cost effective.</li>
      <li>Besides that, this is pretty good stuff and most definitely</li>
      <li>This is really hard to find in stores so the price and availability on amazon is perfect.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff so much, I will never buy another brand of hand sanitizer.</li>
      <li>a worthwhile purchase (when the price is reasonable, of course).</li>
      <li>My all family use it when we go out, yes ,It&#x60;s really handy,we all love it</li>
      <li>Drys quick and clean.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s hard to find in most stores, so was happy to find I can buy it in bulk on amazon.</li>
      <li>It also helps that it smells amazing and is somewhat moisturizing, unlike most other antibacterial gels/sprays.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite hand sanitizer and once my friends try it, they want to know where I bought it.  </li>
      <li>Use this all day long at work and everyone asks what that good fresh scent is.</li>
      <li>and I was so delighted, only to find out that immediatly upon shipping my first order they took the item off the subscribe and save program.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are a bit pricey but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It has a fresh clean scent, dries fast.</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>EO is my favorite, but Burt&#x27;s Bees comes in a very close second.</li>
      <li>Leave my skin feeling soft and smells pretty good too (at least to me; some people may not like the potent scent initially).</li>
      <li>and it really works.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really tyte, seriously, very tyte.</li>
      <li>this stuff really does what it says it&#x27;s going to do (i think).</li>
      <li>I like the way it sprays, not too much.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice and does not dry out my skin like other hand sanitizers.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, it&#x27;s in a convenient spray bottle, it&#x27;s lightweight, etc.</li>
      <li>I love rubbing the back of my next with them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After use your hands feel fresh but not dry.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>since it&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s bee, I know it is more natural than other brands.</li>
      <li>so glad you had it...would recommend this product ...does not leave a long lasting medicinal odor,</li>
      <li>The smell is so fresh and the spray is light but wet enough to do the job.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands, and just seems altogether healthier for you than other products</li>
      <li>It is not harsh on our hands and leaves them very soft.</li>
      <li>I have eczema and dry skin issues, but this does not sting like so many other hand sanitizers.</li>
      <li>This is a natural ingredient/ non-viral evolving hand spray.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love that this is a spray product.  Just spray your hands and let them dry.  The scent is best described as clean grapefruit.  I like it.  The active ingredient is Ethyl Alcohol (same as Purell and Germ-x).  After use your hands feel fresh but not dry.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Subscribe and Save and I was so delighted, only to find out that immediatly upon shipping my first order they took the item off the subscribe and save program.  This is a great product for anyone but especially moms.  I love that it is safe as well.</li>
    <li> This is Always my go to choice for hand sanitizer.  We love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this is great.  Another great one!</li>
    <li> i bought this just to try but now it is all i use. im a pharmacist and i am always sanitizing my hands. this stuff smells great and leaves my hands feelng nice. it doesnt build up on your ands like the traditional hand sanitizers.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have been using it for years and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, so glad to be able to get it at Amazon.  It has a fresh clean scent, dries fast. great hand santizer!</li>
    <li> hard to find in stores..so glad you had it...would recommend this product ...does not leave a long lasting medicinal odor,</li>
    <li> Leave my skin feeling soft and smells pretty good too (at least to me; some people may not like the potent scent initially). It also makes for an effective acne treatment. I applied it topically to an infected pimple, and the infection cleared up overnight. The combination of witch hazel and alcohol makes it excellent for use as an antibacterial/antibiotic AND an antiseptic (can be applied to cuts or blemishes to clean and reduce swelling). And the aloe moisturizes your skin, unlike some other hand sanitizers that can leave the skin dried out. I may have to subscribe to this stuff.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. My husband and I needed a sanitizer for health reasons and I knew Burt&#x27;s Bees reputation so I ordered it. We have been very pleased. It is not harsh on our hands and leaves them very soft. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees hand sanitizer is pretty good, though I sure as heck wouldn&#x27;t pay anything close to the 40 dollars I see it listed for at the moment. That&#x27;s insane. EO hand sanitizer is also very nice, and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than that! But anyways, I do think this sanitizer is one of the nicer brands out there. It has a pleasant scent and, more importantly, does not dry out your hands like some sanitizers do. EO is my favorite, but Burt&#x27;s Bees comes in a very close second. The only downside is that, for me, the spray sanitizers just don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the gels do. I find that to be true for most brands, though. Besides that, this is pretty good stuff and most definitely a worthwhile purchase (when the price is reasonable, of course).</li>
    <li> A friend gave me one on a whim and since then I&#x27;ve been hooked. This stuff is absolutely amazing. Not only is it a hand sanitizer, but the scent is the real seller. I love that it&#x27;s spray too. If you have a casual cigarette and need don&#x27;t like the after smell of smoke on your fingers, I swear that this spray does a great job of diffusing the smoke smell -plus it sanitizes! You cannot go wrong, RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
    <li> The Herbal Essential Lavender hand towelettes smell wonderful. Everybody that uses them asks me where I bought them. They make great gifts!&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 packages last month and have given 2 packages away as gift already.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful Lavender smell opens up your sinuses. I love rubbing the back of my next with them.&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit pricey but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I use Burt&#x27;s Aloe &amp; Witch Hazel as my regular hand sanitizer &#x27;cause it is much more cost effective.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a non chemical hand sanitizer and Burt&#x27;s Bees uses only Ethyl Alcohol to achieve this! It is safer than products using Isopropyl alcohol and other alcohol types. It also smells nice. Some might prefer that it have no added fragrance but that is its only negative! I like the way it sprays, not too much. Great product!</li>
    <li> During flu season I wanted something triclosan and propylene glycol free that would help kill germs. It also helps that it smells amazing and is somewhat moisturizing, unlike most other antibacterial gels/sprays. Will for sure repurchase this over &amp; over.</li>
    <li> My family loves this burts bees hand sanitizer. Easy to spray/rub on and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s hard to find in most stores, so was happy to find I can buy it in bulk on amazon. thanks!</li>
    <li> Use this all day long at work and everyone asks what that good fresh scent is. It doesn&#x27;t burn like purell so I hope it&#x27;s actually doing something!</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Wish Burt&#x27;s Bees would continue making it. Was glad to find some.</li>
    <li> YA&#x27;LL ARE OUT OF YOUR MINDS FOR CHARGING $39.99 TO $45 DOLLARS FOR 3 of THIS PRODUCT JUST BECAUSE IT IS DISCONTINUED.  I reported all you sellers to BURTS Bee&#x27;s directly and they are appalled that AMAZON allows this kind of price gouging.  Good luck moving it off your shelves you greedy individuals.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, this works well.  However, don&#x27;t plan on keeping it in your purse/bag because it leaks.  If you just need something to sit on your desk, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have eczema and dry skin issues, but this does not sting like so many other hand sanitizers. It also does not cause me to breakout like some of the other products I have used. I like knowing that my children are using a natural product to help reduce their exposure to germs also and that it is not harsh like some of other other brands.</li>
    <li> Does the job and has a great smell but it does leave your hands sticky for a couple of seconds</li>
    <li> Love this hand sanitizer.  No chemical smell and gets your hands clean.  Also doesn&#x27;t make your hands stink for ages after use.  Pleasent smell.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much, I will never buy another brand of hand sanitizer. It smells fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, it&#x27;s in a convenient spray bottle, it&#x27;s lightweight, etc. LOVE it.</li>
    <li> this stuff really does what it says it&#x27;s going to do (i think). but it&#x27;s really tyte, seriously, very tyte.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered the 3-pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Sanitizer. I love the scent and the containers are small enough to easily fit inside my purse or slip into our glove compartment. Even when it is in the car (heat and cold) it never freezes or clogs up.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I keep one in my car and use it all the time,also keep one in my purse</li>
    <li> This sanitizer is small enough to fit in my purse or diaper bag. The spray is convenient, especially for kids. Smells great, too.</li>
    <li> non-alcoholic spray, wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a natural ingredient/ non-viral evolving hand spray.  This means that it does not promote the evolution of &amp;#34;super-bug&amp;#34; viruses which some scientists believe are enabled by traditional hand sprays.  The fragrance is pleasing and not &amp;#34;medicine-y&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s really handy, I think. My all family use it when we go out, yes ,It&#x60;s really handy,we all love it</li>
    <li> I have been using this hand sanitizer for years and love it.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell or a greasy or slick feel.  It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, and I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;A lot to purchase them in bulks at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except this time, one of the 3 bottle slightly leaked.  Wasn&#x27;t too bad, but took my by surprise.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo, I like the scent, like that it&#x27;s a spray and not a gel type that always seems to slip and fall to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;And since it&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s bee, I know it is more natural than other brands.</li>
    <li> The scent definitely will be everywhere and I don&#x27;t mind it but I wish they had an unscented option. I feel better using this around my daughter than some of the more chemical options.</li>
    <li> Bought these for cruise to help keep kids hands clean. Worked well, nice scent! Package small enough to fit in pocket.</li>
    <li> Smell is awful. Seriously?? You press the top of the spray and almost nothing comes out. Very difficult to use. Never buying this again. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I have tried many many sanitizers, from sprays to gels and this one is the very best I have every tried. Anytime I use it someone always asked me what kind it is. The smell is so fresh and the spray is light but wet enough to do the job. I will never buy another kind again.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite hand sanitizer and once my friends try it, they want to know where I bought it.  Smells great and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> It has a wonderful smell and I loved being able to spray it onto my hands.  I used it during my clinical rotation (Nursing student) and would give me classmates a spray if they forgot their sanitizer.  My husband took one to work, as well.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This has been discontinued like all good things and someone is trying to profit greatly  from it.</li>
    <li> I love it and have used it for years.....unfortunately Burt&#x27;s Bees discontinued it and now only available through &amp;#34;Gougers&amp;#34; such as you have advertised her......original price thru BB&#x27;s was $5.00 per and now you guys are asking about $15.00......simply outrageous!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product - I am in love with it. However, there is a price mistake as these three little bottles cost less that $15.00 in a store. Not the $99.00 quoted. Hope it is corrected soon so I can buy.</li>
    <li> I love this hand sanitizer.  It smells really nice and does not dry out my skin like other hand sanitizers.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses this everyday at every possible situation. She is obsessed, so i am happy that this product doesn&#x27;t dry her hands out like other products do. It smells better than oil and alcohol based products as well. In fact, everyone she has demonstrated the product on has ended up converting to using this product. The only shame is that it is hard to find in a regular bricks &amp; mortar store so i have to get it on Amazon for her.</li>
    <li> I love this product, have used it for over 4 years.  No strong odor and it really works.  I keep one in my car and my purse.  Prevention is the only way to protect you from all the germs out there.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands, and just seems altogether healthier for you than other products</li>
    <li> Cleans my hands with a subtle refreshing scent, and does not dry them out. One is always in my purse!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for tucking anywhere you might need them. The scent is wonderful and not chemically like other sanitizers. This is really hard to find in stores so the price and availability on amazon is perfect.</li>
    <li> Bought it based on reviews that I red here. Product has good smell, and protects skin from dryness and redness as it&#x27;s has aloe. I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this sanitizer. It&#x27;s a fresh scent, so it doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol, as most others do. And, the convenience of a spray!!!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this hand sanitizer.  No sticky residue either.  Drys quick and clean.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
