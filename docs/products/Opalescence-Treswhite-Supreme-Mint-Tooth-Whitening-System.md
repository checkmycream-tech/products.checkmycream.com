      <li>this is the best product out there for at home teeth whitening.</li>
      <li>Ordered online and very happy.</li>
      <li>and I was impressed, but was not going to pay the $200 plus at the dental office.</li>
      <li>Before bed seems to work best for me.</li>
      <li>the best price out there.  </li>
      <li>I have had wonderful results and will continue to use them.</li>
      <li>This stuff workers great.</li>
      <li>NO PAIN &amp; Great results.      </li>
      <li>The trays work great, however, I do have increased sensitivity-</li>
      <li>I bought these from my dentist for 2x the price (lesson learned), and have had great results after 4 days.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>but they worked good.</li>
      <li>She loved them too.</li>
      <li>Loved the job it did and then found it for 1/2 the price here.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use and works great.</li>
      <li>Gotta be honest here...</li>
      <li>They are comfortable and taste good.</li>
      <li>So far these are great!</li>
      <li>And my mom has asked for more too.</li>
      <li>I have 6 more trays, and will probably use 3 more, as I don&#x27;t want my teeth to be \\&quot;too white\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>more thing I meant to add:</li>
      <li>I love these...</li>
      <li>I was able to brush afterwards with no pain either.</li>
      <li>I can feel them \\&quot;working\\&quot; (for lack of a better word),</li>
      <li>Just a tip, store these in the fridge for a longer shelf life (but make sure you take them out and let them set for 10 minutes or so since they should be room temperature when you use them).&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now I have been able to wear them for an hour or even a bit longer.    </li>
      <li>I rescheduled the fix so that I had more time to recover and try again if I felt up to it.</li>
      <li>why pay more at the dentist?</li>
      <li>I will order more.</li>
      <li>Im glad I found them on amazon for cheap...</li>
      <li>These are easy to apply.</li>
      <li>No burning, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I was able to keep them on for a full hour with no discomfort.</li>
      <li>It will go away quickly!</li>
      <li>Best to refrigerate  and then let sit for a few minutes before using.</li>
      <li>When I talked to the hygenist, she mentioned that I may have had a buildup of bacteria in the gum area although my gums appeared to be in great shape from my exam a week earlier.</li>
      <li>they work good and fast and they dont cause your teeth to feel sensitive.</li>
      <li>and I can see a difference in my first use!</li>
      <li>I have used 9 of the 10 trays and have had great results over a 4 week period with little to no pain unless the gel overlaps onto the gums</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended this product but after two treatments of twenty minutes each, it makes my teeth fifty times more sensitive than they were before.</li>
      <li>For the $50 price tag I figured I&#x27;d be getting something better than Crest strips yet cheaper than any professional whitening.</li>
      <li>but it was worth trying..</li>
      <li>I like it much, the teeth are getting whiter very fast, but still it seems a bit strong for my teeth.</li>
      <li>I just wouldn&#x27;t use them right before going out.</li>
      <li>Just know if you see this right after use, I wouldn&#x27;t be concerned.</li>
      <li>(I had used the trays right before bed), they had evened out.</li>
      <li>I had such great results from only one application that I made my mom try them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While the first use produced results, each use afterward has also produced results.</li>
      <li>and they were pretty pricey...</li>
      <li>The first day I tried the product, I used my Sonicare toothbrush first and flossed.  </li>
      <li>Simply stick the trays in and when you are sure the strips are in place, remove the trays.  </li>
      <li>I could notice a difference after the first use.</li>
      <li>I bought the Opalescence Treswhite Supreme first from my dentist.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest that you don&#x27;t brush too vigorously at first and use for a shorter duration with your first tray or two...maybe 1/2 hour.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and experienced stinging only on the second day.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t do that at first and it was very helpful.     </li>
      <li>A big hint it to wait about an hour after brushing since your gums will be more sensitive right after brushing.  </li>
      <li>This product is easy to use and definitely whitens your teeth!</li>
      <li>I can easily keep them in for a full hour without any stinging, like I have had with other tooth whitening systems, thanks to the protective gel.</li>
      <li>The gel is very sticky and holds the tray in without having to press them on.</li>
      <li>They go on your teeth very easilly, just read the directions included.</li>
      <li>Very Minimal results although the kit was very easy to use and not messy.</li>
      <li>I had some lighter spots on my teeth right after use, but by the time I woke up the next morning</li>
      <li>and I mean a whole hell of a lot better than they were before I bought these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already seen results in my first use compared to seeing results after 3 weeks with crest white strips.</li>
      <li>I noticed a big difference after my first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I just noticed a slight warm tingling senstation, like a had a piece of big red gum in my mouth.</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive teeth or gums.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried crest white strips before, but I didn&#x27;t really notice any results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that is true, but it did get much easier.    </li>
      <li>If my teeth whiten even more in my next few uses, I will definitely buy these again.</li>
      <li>yes they caused slight discomfort the first time</li>
      <li>You may experience uneven whitening at first.</li>
      <li>As to the previous person who posted saying that there was too much gel... not so.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> this is the best product out there for at home teeth whitening. I will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> I have only used one other tooth whitening system before, but the other one did not cause any pain or discomfort. With this kit, I have severe shooting pains in my teeth after about 10 minutes of use. My dentist told me that this is the brand she recommends for her patients, but I have had to discontinue the treatment after three 10-minute applications.</li>
    <li> I got these from my dentist. I had such great results from only one application that I made my mom try them. She loved them too. They are comfortable and taste good. As to the previous person who posted saying that there was too much gel... not so. There are two gels in the trays. One is to whiten the teeth and the other is to protect the gums from the bleaching gel. When you put the trays on you are not supposed to press them against the teeth to the the point that gel oozes out and away from the teeth. The gel is very sticky and holds the tray in without having to press them on. When used properly there is no oozing. I can easily keep them in for a full hour without any stinging, like I have had with other tooth whitening systems, thanks to the protective gel. I have had wonderful results and will continue to use them. And my mom has asked for more too.</li>
    <li> I like it much, the teeth are getting whiter very fast, but still it seems a bit strong for my teeth. maybe I should choose the same system but with less peroxid level.</li>
    <li> I bought these from my dentist for 2x the price (lesson learned), and have had great results after 4 days. I have 6 more trays, and will probably use 3 more, as I don&#x27;t want my teeth to be \\&quot;too white\\&quot;. The trays work great, however, I do have increased sensitivity- which my dentist warned me of.</li>
    <li> I bought these from my dentist.  The first day I tried the product, I used my Sonicare toothbrush first and flossed.  Maybe I should have taken it a bit easier before the application.  I was in MAJOR pain on the gums and an area where I have a small cavity to be repaired.  The next day was worse but I was having a chip repaired and wanted my tooth color to lighten before the repair.  I rescheduled the fix so that I had more time to recover and try again if I felt up to it. I waited about 5 days for my gums &amp; teeth to settle down &amp; tried them again.  NO PAIN &amp; Great results.      When I talked to the hygenist, she mentioned that I may have had a buildup of bacteria in the gum area although my gums appeared to be in great shape from my exam a week earlier. She said that the use of the gel may have gotten rid of the bacteria.  I&#x27;m not sure if that is true, but it did get much easier.    A big hint it to wait about an hour after brushing since your gums will be more sensitive right after brushing.  ALSO, use a wet Q-tip to remove gel that is overlapping onto the gum area.  I didn&#x27;t do that at first and it was very helpful.     I have used 9 of the 10 trays and have had great results over a 4 week period with little to no pain unless the gel overlaps onto the gums and I don&#x27;t remove it within a few minutes.    I&#x27;d suggest that you don&#x27;t brush too vigorously at first and use for a shorter duration with your first tray or two...maybe 1/2 hour.  As you build up add more time but remove if they become uncomfortable. Now I have been able to wear them for an hour or even a bit longer.    Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used tres white in the past and this is what my dentist recommends to me unless I want to sit in a chair for $500.00 to whiten my teeth. The gel is preloaded in strips, which sits in a tray for both the upper and lower teeth.  Simply stick the trays in and when you are sure the strips are in place, remove the trays.  As long as the trays are at room temperature, the strips stay in place and not once have I had a problem with gel oozing out of my mouth.  These can stay in for 30-60 minutes each day for ten days.  I have sensitive teeth and experienced stinging only on the second day.  After that, there was not pain.  Something else to note is that my dentist told me to NOT drink coffee, tea, red wine, or soda (like Coke) while whitening my teeth. Your teeth will absorb the color of these products and restain. I noticed a difference in my teeth after the second day.  They were definitely whiter.  This product is easy to use and definitely whitens your teeth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using these for two days (15%) and while it&#x27;s too early to see what the results will be, the product is somewhat painful to use!  I just had my teeth cleaned, so I know I don&#x27;t have any build up or problems, but when the gel gets on my gums, it burns and stings.  I do not have sensitive teeth or gums.  I&#x27;ve been tempted to take them out after only a few minutes, but considering I paid a lot (since I purchased through my dentist), I leave it in despite the pain.  I&#x27;m going to use the suggestion from another review and try to run a q-tip along my gums after I put them on my teeth, but I unless the results blow me away, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using again.</li>
    <li> I bought the Opalescence Treswhite Supreme first from my dentist.  Loved the job it did and then found it for 1/2 the price here.  No burning, easy to use.  Best to refrigerate  and then let sit for a few minutes before using.</li>
    <li> this product works well.  the best price out there.  I would recommend it</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product but after two treatments of twenty minutes each, it makes my teeth fifty times more sensitive than they were before. Experiencing teeth pain, sensitivity to cold and hot liquids. I don&#x27;t recommend this for repeated use.</li>
    <li> This product works! Received it in about 2 days and it came with a long shelf life into 2016.</li>
    <li> I love these... they work good and fast and they dont cause your teeth to feel sensitive. I used to get these from a cosmetic dentist in LA and they were pretty pricey... but they worked good. Im glad I found them on amazon for cheap... The only thing I hate is that I have to keep adding words because amazon thinks my reviews are too short</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product.  It is easy to use and works great. I will order more.</li>
    <li> Just recieved these today in the mail, shipped in under 5 days! I have already used them for an hour and I can see a difference in my first use! They go on your teeth very easilly, just read the directions included. I was able to keep them on for a full hour with no discomfort. A lot of people have meantioned having some pain during or after using these and I just noticed a slight warm tingling senstation, like a had a piece of big red gum in my mouth. But it wasn&#x27;t enough to make me want to take them out. I was able to brush afterwards with no pain either. So far these are great! I&#x27;ve already seen results in my first use compared to seeing results after 3 weeks with crest white strips. If my teeth whiten even more in my next few uses, I will definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Didnt work at all... Hated it!!</li>
    <li> Very Minimal results although the kit was very easy to use and not messy. a bit expensive too compared to other brands but it was worth trying..</li>
    <li> My uncle is a dentist, and he recommended this product. I&#x27;ve tried crest white strips before, but I didn&#x27;t really notice any results. These are easy to apply. Since my teeth are relatively white already, I just use these once a week or so. I noticed a big difference after my first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the first use produced results, each use afterward has also produced results. I will continue to use this product. Just a tip, store these in the fridge for a longer shelf life (but make sure you take them out and let them set for 10 minutes or so since they should be room temperature when you use them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing I meant to add: You may experience uneven whitening at first. I had some lighter spots on my teeth right after use, but by the time I woke up the next morning (I had used the trays right before bed), they had evened out. Just know if you see this right after use, I wouldn&#x27;t be concerned. It will go away quickly! I just wouldn&#x27;t use them right before going out. Before bed seems to work best for me.</li>
    <li> Recently bought these trays. For the $50 price tag I figured I&#x27;d be getting something better than Crest strips yet cheaper than any professional whitening. So I try these things out. I could notice a difference after the first use. I can feel them \\&quot;working\\&quot; (for lack of a better word), yes they caused slight discomfort the first time but I got over it. As I kept using them (around the fourth time) they started to irritate my gums. Although, around the fourth tray my teeth were white...and I mean a whole hell of a lot better than they were before I bought these. So make no mistake about it. These things \\&quot;WORK\\&quot; 100%, they are quite the steal at only $50, but they do come at a price. The gel is discomforting, the strips sometimes won&#x27;t stay in place, but that&#x27;s all just a small price to pay. I leave them in for 45 mins - 1 hr every time. I would definitely recommend these to someone wanting to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> why pay more at the dentist? My dentist gave me a sample and I was impressed, but was not going to pay the $200 plus at the dental office. Ordered online and very happy.</li>
    <li> Gotta be honest here... This stuff workers great. Teeth got very white in a short time. Good product.</li>
