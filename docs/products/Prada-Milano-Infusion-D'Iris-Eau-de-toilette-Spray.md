      <li>Prada makes the best smelling perfumes.</li>

      <li>Nice, light scent.  </li>
      <li>I love this product...</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m severely allergic/sensitive to so many things - can&#x27;t wear or even smell perfumes without getting a headache - but not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the subtleness of the fragrance.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this perfume at Macy&#x27;s and very much love it.</li>
      <li>Didnt smell quite the same as the sample I had, but still a good refreshing feminine scent.</li>
      <li>good perfume, to my wife likes, would like it to last longer, That is the reason to give it 4 stars.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to women&#x27;s perfume as most women&#x27;s scents cause headaches</li>
      <li>Great fragrance for everyday of summer</li>
      <li>Smelled nice but not the same as the one I purchased at Macys.</li>
      <li>and this is the first time I ordered perfume on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Okay, that was dramatic, but it really does have a clean, refreshing scent.</li>
      <li>I used to use only on special occasions, but now use every day - smells</li>
      <li>Not bad, just different.</li>
      <li>Half the price of in-store and the lotion was free!</li>
      <li>Nice everyday perfume, not too heavy or strong.  </li>
      <li>Not sure which one is the more accurate scent, so be careful.</li>
      <li>Gave it 3 stars because has a soft fragrance but doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
      <li>Most designer perfumes smell as serious as the names on their boxes.</li>
      <li>This is the second bottle of Milano that I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon and this one smells very different from the first one.</li>
      <li>However, this perfume is not only feminine, its very soft.</li>
      <li>The only downside to this aroma for me is that its scent is not long lasting!</li>
      <li>I like this perfume very much but felt it was not as lasting as others I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>

    <li> I love this product...and this is the first time I ordered perfume on Amazon. however and unfortunately did not get it. UPS tracking said they dropped off on front door. I have no idea who to talk with about this, or who to talk with. Only that I was in the middle of moving and it may have looked like no one lived at this address.&lt;br /&gt;By chance... Was it returned to you?&lt;br /&gt;Lisza</li>
    <li> Great price!!! This perfume smells delicious! I love it!!! Prada makes the best smelling perfumes. My next is going to be Prada Candy!</li>
    <li> Most designer perfumes smell as serious as the names on their boxes. For this reason, I usually stick to mists. They&#x27;re lighter and have an overall nicer smell to them. Especially during the spring. But I went to Sephora and got Prada Milano Infusion D&#x27;Iris as a sample, and I was astounded to find that it is the perfect fragrance. It is light and fresh and perfect for springtime. It reminds me of clothes drying on a line in the Italian country side. Okay, that was dramatic, but it really does have a clean, refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this perfume at Macy&#x27;s and very much love it. I am very sensitive to women&#x27;s perfume as most women&#x27;s scents cause headaches so I don&#x27;t often wear any. However, this perfume is not only feminine, its very soft. The only downside to this aroma for me is that its scent is not long lasting!</li>
    <li> Gave it 3 stars because has a soft fragrance but doesn&#x27;t linger. Nice size bottle and came well packaged with a silk makeup pouch and lotion.</li>
    <li> Didnt smell quite the same as the sample I had, but still a good refreshing feminine scent. I&#x27;ll continue to use</li>
    <li> Was thrilled to find this thru Amazon. Half the price of in-store and the lotion was free! My fav scent.</li>
    <li> Bought this for wife, she lived it</li>
    <li> Great fragrance for everyday of summer</li>
    <li> Nice everyday perfume, not too heavy or strong.  Very light and sensual.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for the past 3-4 years. It has a very light scent that lasts all day. I get a lot of compliments on the way it smells.</li>
    <li> This is twice the price at our local stores.  A good value.  I didn&#x27;t think I could afford to ever wear Prada, now I&#x27;ll wear it when every the mood strikes.</li>
    <li> Smelled nice but not the same as the one I purchased at Macys. Still a good deal for the price</li>
    <li> I like this perfume very much but felt it was not as lasting as others I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of Milano that I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon and this one smells very different from the first one. Not bad, just different. Not sure which one is the more accurate scent, so be careful.</li>
    <li> I love the subtleness of the fragrance. It isn&#x27;t cloying and does not aggravate my allergies. Airy floral scent with a powdery background scent. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent.  Non-flowery, non-citrus.  Nice, light scent.  ALWAYS get compliments when I wear this scent.  I used to use only on special occasions, but now use every day - smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great gift for the lady who doesn&#x27;t usually like perfume, or has lots of allergies/sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m severely allergic/sensitive to so many things - can&#x27;t wear or even smell perfumes without getting a headache - but not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful and may be a great option for the allergy-prone lady.</li>
    <li> Not a real perfume!&lt;br /&gt;Not HAPPY with the product!&lt;br /&gt;Please dont order this if you do you are westing Your monet</li>
    <li> good perfume, to my wife likes, would like it to last longer, That is the reason to give it 4 stars.</li>
