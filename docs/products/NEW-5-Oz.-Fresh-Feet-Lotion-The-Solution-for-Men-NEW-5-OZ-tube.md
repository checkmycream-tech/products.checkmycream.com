      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to find a product that works well.  </li>

      <li>Better than an Avon product I also tried and reviewed.</li>
      <li>This goes on as a cream but dries more as a powder.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to wash your hands after applying</li>
      <li>And make sure to wash your hands</li>
      <li>No problems with odor any more.</li>

      <li>Fresh feet has changed my life for the better!</li>
      <li>Fresh Feet is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Now that summer is on the way this product will keep us cool and comfy all season!</li>
      <li>Tried this because I like the fresh balls so much, not as happy with this.</li>
      <li>This system works very well if your doing any kind of minimalist travel.</li>
      <li>Much more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>Overall, great buy.</li>
      <li>The Fresh Body Fresh Feet has a very strong peppermint smell.  </li>
      <li>Great at keeping my feet dry</li>
      <li>I had a huge issue with swampy smelly feet after 3 days of very hot desert weather.</li>
      <li>Now that he has an almost full time job</li>
      <li>Fresh Feet is Hypoallergenic and is Talc Free.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure if you buy fresh feet right now</li>
      <li>There is a mild medicine-mentholy smell but it doesn&#x27;t permeate through the socks or shoes.</li>
      <li>I got Fresh Feet for my oldest son who lives in combat boots and would even wear the in gym class if allowed.  </li>
      <li>The dry feeling lasts all day--I was wearing shoes that had canvas tops with a synthetic footbed and the day was warm around 80F.  </li>
      <li>Does good job of keeping feet dry and comfortable for the entire day.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re pretty stinky.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my husband’s feet from smelling in the hot summer.  </li>
      <li>Lotion feels and smells good, just messy.</li>
      <li>While Fresh Feet has made it so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about taking off my shoes to enter a friends house (I live in Hawaii where we don&#x27;t wear our shoes in the house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to test it out much.</li>
      <li>I wash my hands after using but suppose I could get away with not (I just wouldn&#x27;t tell anyone because who wants to touch your hands after you&#x27;ve touched your feet?).  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping .</li>
      <li>I do not find the issue others mention of it drying on your hands to be much of an issue.</li>
      <li>cream beats messy powders, although it would be nice if they sold a size that was TSA compliant</li>
      <li>but it leaves a white powder which doesn&#x27;t look good if you&#x27;re wearing dark colored dress socks</li>
      <li>main ingredient is tapioca powder in case anyone needed to know.</li>
      <li>I gave him the Fresh Feet and totally deodorized his boots with charcoal and baking soda, and I think we may have this under control.  </li>
      <li>This goes on quickly and makes my feet feel refreshed all day long, it has a cooling effect in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The St. Ives product was a little better but this is a close second.</li>
      <li>Before fresh feet I would walk around the house in a cloud of white baby powder dust similar to the style of pig pen!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a no mess solution.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly and there isn&#x27;t a mess of powdery residue afterward.  </li>
      <li>he&#x27;s on his feet for many hours making his issue even worse.  </li>

<li> he&#x27;s on his feet for many hours making his issue even worse.  </li>
<li> I have been searching for a replacement to a St. Ives product used a few years back that they apparently stopped producing.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t seems to get my socks on (wet or dry) without getting white everywhere.</li>
<li> It keeps my husband’s feet from smelling and keeps them dry all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It works feet dry</li>
<li> Put in on, give it 15-30 seconds to dry, put on socks and then wash hands.</li>
<li> I put on in the morning let dry and put on before bed.</li>
<li> Now I walk stealth through the house like a dry footed ninja!</li>
<li> Before using this, I would have to take off my shoes while at work to let the socks air out, but I&#x27;ve managed to go all day and only feel slightly damp between the toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> On all these type of outings I bring minimal equipment so I wash out socks every evening in a creek or sink and let dry at night.</li>
<li> When I finally got to take my shoes off, I wasn&#x27;t knocked out by the usual smell</li>
<li> It has Eucalyptus Oil, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Aloe Vera and other</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t make a powdery mess handling my black socks.</li>
<li> You can get it in between your toes and not miss a nook or cranny, and unlike powders, you don&#x27;t leave a geenormous mess on the floor</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t put a lot on each foot--just a small dab.  </li>
<li> dries to a powder that is thick.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve found that if you apply a thin layer, you won&#x27;t get the chalk look on your feet</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor just not a good one.</li>
<li> I was having a terrible time with my feet.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> Just make sure to wash your hands after applying</li>
    <li> Great at keeping my feet dry but it leaves a white powder which doesn&#x27;t look good if you&#x27;re wearing dark colored dress socks</li>
    <li> If you have a teenage boy then you know their feet sweat and they&#x27;re pretty stinky.  Sometimes I know they&#x27;re coming in the room before they even get in because of the smell.  I got Fresh Feet for my oldest son who lives in combat boots and would even wear the in gym class if allowed.  Now that he has an almost full time job he&#x27;s on his feet for many hours making his issue even worse.  I gave him the Fresh Feet and totally deodorized his boots with charcoal and baking soda, and I think we may have this under control.  It&#x27;s nice to find a product that works well.  He does apply this 2 times a day though.  Once in the morning and then one before he goes to work.</li>
    <li> it leaves white residue, and it look embarassing!</li>
    <li> Great item for those on their feet hours daily.</li>
    <li> Works as it suppose too</li>
    <li> Tried this because I like the fresh balls so much, not as happy with this. I can&#x27;t seems to get my socks on (wet or dry) without getting white everywhere. Lotion feels and smells good, just messy.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to test it out much. Much more hassle than it&#x27;s worth. It turns to a powder on your feet.  AND your hands! So I gotta run around with my powdery feet to wash my powdery hands so I don&#x27;t make a powdery mess handling my black socks.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Feels great!  Now that summer is on the way this product will keep us cool and comfy all season!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t keep my feet from sweating, don&#x27;t care for the lotion to powder experience.</li>
    <li> Fresh feet has changed my life for the better! Before fresh feet I would walk around the house in a cloud of white baby powder dust similar to the style of pig pen! Now I walk stealth through the house like a dry footed ninja! I&#x27;m pretty sure if you buy fresh feet right now you can become a ninja too!</li>
    <li> I was SO happy to find this! It goes on like a lotion then dries to a powder so it&#x27;s a no mess solution. You can get it in between your toes and not miss a nook or cranny, and unlike powders, you don&#x27;t leave a geenormous mess on the floor (well, I do anyway...) Many women&#x27;s shoes are designed to be worn without socks, but unfortunately this becomes a hotbed so to speak for stank causing bacteria. This goes on quickly and makes my feet feel refreshed all day long, it has a cooling effect in my opinion. Interestingly, because it turns into a powder, it also helps prevent blisters!</li>
    <li> Finally. I have been searching for a replacement to a St. Ives product used a few years back that they apparently stopped producing. This goes on as a cream but dries more as a powder. Avoids the problem with powders and sprays of keeping the overspray off wherever you apply it. I do not find the issue others mention of it drying on your hands to be much of an issue. Put in on, give it 15-30 seconds to dry, put on socks and then wash hands. Does good job of keeping feet dry and comfortable for the entire day. The St. Ives product was a little better but this is a close second. Better than an Avon product I also tried and reviewed.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Use it whenever I wear heels to avoid the mushy sliding foot.</li>
    <li> dries to a powder that is thick. It works feet dry</li>
    <li> This works about 80% effectively to prevent my toes from sweating when I wear leather oxfords. Before using this, I would have to take off my shoes while at work to let the socks air out, but I&#x27;ve managed to go all day and only feel slightly damp between the toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream beats messy powders, although it would be nice if they sold a size that was TSA compliant so I could pop it into my carry-on luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredient is tapioca powder in case anyone needed to know. There is a mild medicine-mentholy smell but it doesn&#x27;t permeate through the socks or shoes.</li>
    <li> Keeps you smelling fresh and feeling good. Fast shipping . Thank You A++++</li>
    <li> I wear weatherproof motorcycle boots on multi day tours every year. I had a huge issue with swampy smelly feet after 3 days of very hot desert weather. I did some research and found this product. I put on in the morning let dry and put on before bed. No problems with odor any more. I use it backpacking as well. On all these type of outings I bring minimal equipment so I wash out socks every evening in a creek or sink and let dry at night. This system works very well if your doing any kind of minimalist travel. It is remarkable</li>
    <li> Product actually works well.  Only drawback is the powder finish.  Overall, great buy.</li>
    <li> I was having a terrible time with my feet.  This product turned them around.  It doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor just not a good one.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for keeping my feet drier than when not using it.  I don&#x27;t put a lot on each foot--just a small dab.  It dries quickly and there isn&#x27;t a mess of powdery residue afterward.  I wash my hands after using but suppose I could get away with not (I just wouldn&#x27;t tell anyone because who wants to touch your hands after you&#x27;ve touched your feet?).  The dry feeling lasts all day--I was wearing shoes that had canvas tops with a synthetic footbed and the day was warm around 80F.  When I finally got to take my shoes off, I wasn&#x27;t knocked out by the usual smell so I think it works.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working on my feet and toes.</li>
    <li> The Fresh Body Fresh Feet has a very strong peppermint smell.  It keeps my husband’s feet from smelling in the hot summer.  It also prevents his feet from getting sweaty without having to use powder in his work boots while at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on like lotion - just shake the tube well.  Apply it with hands.  And make sure to wash your hands after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fresh Feet is Hypoallergenic and is Talc Free.  It has Eucalyptus Oil, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Aloe Vera and other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it says.  It keeps my husband’s feet from smelling and keeps them dry all day.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product above in exchange for my unbiased review. Regardless, I only recommend products I personally have used.</li>
    <li> Fresh Feet is amazing.  I suffer from sweaty, stinky feet.  While Fresh Feet has made it so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about taking off my shoes to enter a friends house (I live in Hawaii where we don&#x27;t wear our shoes in the house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some reviews that claim the product can get in your socks and makes your feet look like you stepped in chalk.  I&#x27;ve found that if you apply a thin layer, you won&#x27;t get the chalk look on your feet and it won&#x27;t gunk on your socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Feet Lotion is definitely a must if you suffer from sweaty, stinky feet.</li>
