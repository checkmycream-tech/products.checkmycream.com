      <li>Covers flawlessly and feels natural.</li>
      <li>Such a great deal, I will keep ordering!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the coverage is &amp;#34;total&amp;#34;, but I have found that the concealer in pots does seem to cover better than sticks or liquids.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very creamy- lovely!!</li>
      <li>Great for my 60 year old skin.  </li>
      <li>I have a fair skin tone and this concealer really works for me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>I have fine lines under my eyes and this product does glide over them.  </li>
      <li>so it goes on smoothly without tugging the skin.  </li>
      <li>This is so smooth and creamy, does not tug or pull on at all.</li>
      <li>SMOOTH AND CREAMY CONSISTENCY.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure there is any perfect makeup for under the eyes.</li>
      <li>Very sheer without good coverage.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about Honeybee Gardens.</li>
      <li>After lightly powdering my fact, I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
      <li>I have bought quite a few under eye concealers through the years and this is by far the best one I have ever purchased.  </li>
      <li>After I heal I know it will perfectly cover the remaining few big freckles (age spots?!?!)</li>
      <li>I will absolutely stick with this product from now on!</li>
      <li>but it DOES do better than most of the products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t have the problem that I have experienced with other types of concealers that actually make wrinkles under my eye more obvious.</li>
      <li>The Total Coverage Under Eye Concealer goes on easily.</li>
      <li>It blends very well.</li>
      <li>This concealer is very creamy</li>
      <li>It does a really nice job concealing and does not give me a heavy made up look.  </li>
      <li>other than that it was ok</li>
      <li>I fortunately just happened to invest in quality make-up for the first and was extremely thankful I had this product.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>Probably a little too light for my skin tone (my fault!)</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It clearly reads methylparaben and propylparaben.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy coverup.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say you don&#x27;t see the lines after applying</li>
      <li>no, I am not affiliated with them at all...just searched all the other healthy brands and was relieved to finally find an entire product line I can use!</li>
      <li>I seriously would not be able to leave the house without it.</li>
      <li>and I actually looked older</li>
      <li>I use very little of this concealer by just patting lightly under my eyes and on a couple of spots on my face.  </li>
      <li>Not really thick at all and offers little coverage.</li>

    <li> Great coverage.  Blends well.  Such a great deal, I will keep ordering!</li>

    <li> I am happy with this concealer. Probably a little too light for my skin tone (my fault!) but it covers well and is not chalky.</li>
    <li> too small but it does the job I just wish it would be a little bit bigger. other than that it was ok</li>
    <li> Although the ingredient list is in small print on the back of the item, there are parabens in it.&lt;br /&gt;It clearly reads methylparaben and propylparaben. That&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
    <li> I had a medical procedure done on my face that resulted in 8 weeks of spotty redness and some inflammation while it healed. I fortunately just happened to invest in quality make-up for the first and was extremely thankful I had this product. I seriously would not be able to leave the house without it. It covers so well that no one would every know the shockingly bad condition of my skin. After I heal I know it will perfectly cover the remaining few big freckles (age spots?!?!) on my face. I&#x27;m Irish fair and this color was perfect.</li>
    <li> I have a fair skin tone and this concealer really works for me.  Every time I want to brighten up around my eyes I use it.  It stays in place.</li>
    <li> A small amount of this product does a great job of covering the worst under-eye cirlces as well as other dark areas on the face,  It lasts all day and works well with make-up.  It great for even the most senisitive eyes, no fragrance, non-irritating.</li>
    <li> Best concealer EVER!! This is so smooth and creamy, does not tug or pull on at all. Covers flawlessly and feels natural. Love it!!</li>
    <li> REALLY GREAT CONCEALER.  IT HAS MAXIMUM COVERAGE WITHOUT A &amp;#34;CAKE LOOK&amp;#34; UNDER THE EYES.  A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. SMOOTH AND CREAMY CONSISTENCY.  I WILL DEFINATELY REORDER THIS CONCEALER WHEN MY CURRENT SUPPLY RUNS OUT.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Very sheer without good coverage.  I prefer a concealer that covers well and stays in place.  I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> This concealer is wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t cake on my eyes and I chose the Light/Neutral color for my fair skin.  This product has meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> A nice product but a bit oily</li>
    <li> Good product for concealing. It blends very well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have very dark undereyes- just sometimes, somedays, I could use a concealer. I felt like this made my wrinkles stand out and I actually looked older (im 41). Blending it is difficult as it is very tacky and seems to want to stay right where you initially place it</li>
    <li> The Total Coverage Under Eye Concealer goes on easily. It hides how red and puffy my lids are under my eyes with just a dab. And I don&#x27;t have the problem that I have experienced with other types of concealers that actually make wrinkles under my eye more obvious. The color is perfect-just as shown. I will absolutely stick with this product from now on!</li>
    <li> Best cover up I&#x27;ve found. Very creamy- lovely!!</li>
    <li> I have fine lines under my eyes and this product does glide over them.  I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say you don&#x27;t see the lines after applying but it DOES do better than most of the products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  This product is smoother and it does cover.</li>
    <li> I have bought quite a few under eye concealers through the years and this is by far the best one I have ever purchased.  It does a really nice job concealing and does not give me a heavy made up look.  The seller was great and I received it within 3 days.</li>
    <li> Not really thick at all and offers little coverage.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about Honeybee Gardens. Paraben free and healthy!!! Awesome company and no, I am not affiliated with them at all...just searched all the other healthy brands and was relieved to finally find an entire product line I can use!</li>
