<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This was a gift for my sister and she loves it and uses it daily. So far so good. There have been no problems and the item arrived on time, packed nicely, and in good condition.</li>
    <li> It works great! I love the setting that it runs on without light so I can leave it on overnight.</li>
    <li> Loving it! Use it everyday with my essential oils. Goes for hours! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> ITEM ONLY LASTED 60 DAYS, DONT EVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER, RETURN POLICY ONLY LETS YOU RETURN FOR 30 DAYS, THIS IS A SCAM</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser, as I was looking for something that would last a long time before it was empty (especially to run at night in the kids&#x27; rooms). The larger capacity took care of that.  It started off working great right out of the box, but a week or so ago I went to use it and when I turned it on, the light came on for about 3 seconds, no mist came out (it usually starts instantly), and then it shut itself off. I kept trying it, hoping for a different outcome, but no luck.  I was hoping to get a diffuser that was not SUPER expensive, but would last.  I emailed the company 11/11, and am now waiting for a response...</li>
    <li> Might be a stretch to say the Mirage was life changing, but I now love diffusing oils and use it daily. It creates a calm and happy aura to wherever I use it. I bought the Zaq Mirage model first and liked it so much that I bought the Noor and Dew for other rooms.  This one has almost double the capacity so I prefer the Mirage.  It&#x27;s quiet and the colors are beautiful. The smell is very subtle, not like a scented candle, and fairly local to the area where you&#x27;re diffusing. I use distilled water and Edens Garden synergy blend oils. The steam is cool and the unit is very stable. The auto off works great - it lasts about 4-5 hours.  The packaging is very nice and would make a great gift.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Fantastic diffuser! Very happy</li>
    <li> My first eo diffuser, works great. It does make a slight noise aside from the bubbling water, it doesn&#x27;t bother me but my husband can&#x27;t sleep with the sound.</li>
    <li> It puts out a small amount of vapor. I keep it on the night stand near my bed for night use. If I move it across the room it has little effective. Of course it also depends on the scent &amp; amount of essential oil used. Do not even consider this as a humidifier, the output will not do squat. It has a small reservoir, 150 ml that can last 4 to 5 hrs. However I found after two plus hours the scent gets very weak. I&#x27;m not thrilled with it, the only reason I kept it was because it works. That&#x27;s saying something for most of these units.    Edit June 8 2015 - The vapor is even less, it runs a lot before I notice the scent. I seldom use it but I took it apart thinking I could clean it better. Its still the same less than 7 months for a few hours use. Most diffusers work on the same principal. You would think some would produce a good unit. Spending a 100 bucks a year, buying one then a replacement for it - I should be committed!</li>
    <li> Live this diffuser and will be ordering more as gifts !</li>
    <li> Looks so sleek and nice in my living room.  Lights up in all different colors continuously.  I wasn&#x27;t aware that it did that.  I had the impression that I bought a blue one.  Either way, it was perfect and it worked superbly.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised but it will only be effective in a small room due to the low volume of mist it generates.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this diffuser! I had purchased a different brand diffuser and I really didn&#x27;t like how it would shut off and still be half way filled with water/oils. This diffuser works for 6 hours straight and all the water is gone when it shuts off. I also love the different lighting options it has. You can have it change different colors, pick a steady color, or shut the light off and still have the mist on. If you are thinking about buying a diffuser. I would definitely recommend that you buy this one!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great.  works instantly.</li>
    <li> Works very well for the most part. I love not depending on burning tea lights constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost -1 star for the deskspace it consumes, but it wasn&#x27;t quite enough for the deduction. Overall, we&#x27;re very pleased with it</li>
    <li> It stops working after a month for no reason.</li>
    <li> Enjoying this item; thanks.</li>
    <li> Works great, looks great, easy to fill, and my toddler can&#x27;t topple it over (due to the wide base).  I&#x27;m tempted to buy another couple of them, but thinking of something more cost effective.  I&#x27;ll be mad I did right?</li>
    <li> absolutely wonderful. easy set up works great.&lt;br /&gt;and the colors are awesome.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on the 10th of November and it is now December 19 . I have used this almost every day and now it is dead. I used the proper water ( distilled ) and kept this clean. I loved this while it lasted but at the cost of around forty some dollars and less than two months that it lasted I would say I was very stupid to purchase something that cost so much and get so little use. I would not recommend this to anyone. I do not like to leave a negative review but this one has me fuming. I am not one that expects something to last forever and I was really hoping that this could last 6 months. I can only say this is total junk and if you like to blow your hard earned money than this is just what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Great completely natural way to change the smell of a space for little investment! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Water lasts quite a bit longer than I thought which is a real bonus! Also really like how I can manage light!</li>
    <li> Great easy travel companion</li>
    <li> Mirage review:&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Came quickly works great. Love how you can turn the light off completely. I have been using citrus oils because they are in the blends I have. Hoping it doesn&#x27;t break the diffuser but I wipe it clean after each use. I will up date in a month or 2 if I still love it</li>
    <li> Love this! I use it everyday. It&#x27;s easy to clean and if I forget it&#x27;s on I don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking because it automatically shuts off. The colors are beautiful and it can work well as a night light. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Uses up your oil in redivide very quickly</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been great. It&#x27;s everything that I expected it to be. Quiet, simple and long running.</li>
    <li> I recently started using essential oils so bought this after reading many positive reviews. This diffuser is so easy to use and it works wonderfully! I have been using it daily for the past 7-10 days and it generally runs for 5-8 hours before running out. I have used it with a variety of different essential oils. The unit continually changes color and I worried it would be distracting but the colors are soft and relaxing. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have  3 diffusers and this one is my favorite. The mist is substantial and runs the whole night for me. You can have the lights fade in and out, set it at a color you prefer or keep it lit with no color. You can also not use any light. It works very well.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really like this diffuser so far. I got it friday and used it right away with roman chamomile, lavender and vetiver essential oils. I do wish it would produce more mist. i have a 12 ft by 13 ft bedroom and it doesnt seem to scent the room. if i have it next to my bedside it works perfect. thats what i got it for anyways was for sleep. so far ive had full night sleeps. i hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this product.  I used it maybe 8 times, and it has stopped working, and Amazon says no return, it is past the return window!  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Soothing and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It instantly spews out mist, which is always surprising to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s practically silent and lasts for about eight hours on what I can only describe as shockingly little water. I am very pleased with this purchase, it was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Item was so light weight it slid easily across furniture surface making it prone to spilling water and oil contents.  I also did not like the size and look of the design.</li>
    <li> I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this one. I had read the reviews and I was sold. I was so excited to get it and try it out. The first couple times I used it, it worked ok, I thought maybe it&#x27;s just the brand or how much oil I am putting into it. Well it&#x27;s been almost two months of using it almost every night and over all it is disappointing. I am sitting next too it right now with almost 20 drops of one of my more potent oils and I can&#x27;t even smell it unless I stick my face right into the cool mist part. I was hoping for at LEAST a 10 foot distance of scent.</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it every night. I would definitely recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> This is a very soothing product.  The lights are not to bright and this device makes little to no noise.  The device will shut off when the water runs out so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the motor burning up.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit in january and it has worked fairly well until today. The diffuser started the night working well, just like it had since January, however it dimmed to about 1/10th its normal light output and began flashing to white light like a thunderstorm was in my daughters bedroom.  Pushing the power button only further prevoked the flashing and it did mot cycle through its options.  The only way to turn it off was to unplug it.  When it was plugged back in it immediately turned back on and began doing what it had been doing before it was unplugged.  This to me tells me that it is shorted and that is a big safety hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the unit worked it was great, but when it failed it failed dramatically and didnt even make it to 6 months old.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s beautiful and Ive gotten a lot of compliments! Downside, is not large enough to diffuse oil throughout my entire living room (rather large) and the top does not secure to the structure so it can leave or spill if bumped or moved which would fry the mechanism. Other than that it is beautiful and I would recommend for a bedroom area</li>
    <li> This one is half the price of others I&#x27;ve bought and 10 times better</li>
    <li> Defiantly recommend this love it! Perfect size easy to use and like the shape and the colors</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, and it could also be used in China, which surprised me.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I love the fact it can be completely dark and only the mist can be set to work. I use it every night in my room.</li>
    <li> Have had this for 8 months. Works great. Nice variety of colours. LED light low energy. I prefer the white light option as it burns slower, while the colour options seem to burn through water faster.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser! It&#x27;s very easy to use and extremely quiet. It turns off automatically on its own once all of the water is gone.</li>
    <li> Awesome lighting and makes very strong oils way less overpowering. Good alternative to scentsy wax melts even if you don&#x27;t care so much about the health benefits of oils just the smell itself without using toxic chemicals is a reason to buy if you love a fresh smelling room.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves this little machine. She uses it every night with essential oils and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> I love this. It is not messy and really works well. I would give it a definite thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Great diffuser, very noiseless (I am comparing Young Living diffuser to this one, although, both work great). Everybody loves the appearance, colors it&#x27;s making, the size, and the absence of hubble-bubble, lol, which is very important for us at night. I hope this product will last very long. Already recommended to all my friends who enjoy essential oil therapy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I just wish the water holder was a tad bit bigger!</li>
    <li> I used it through out the winters. I have used it as a humidifier rather than a diffuser as I have a small bedroom. It has helped a lot with my dry itchy skin. Easy to use and clean. Does not make a lot of noise. Just be careful around kids as they might topple it. It looks beautiful and people usually love seeing the different colors on the diffuser.</li>
    <li> So far it works much better than the spa vapor, which turned off after 30 minutes. This will run continually for several hours (not that you really need it for that long). I use it in my living room, though it works best in smaller rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is, it&#x27;s kind of obnoxious to have do press the button 3 times to turn it off, but I do like the different options for lighting. All around, recommended.</li>
    <li> Our new home princess :) I love this diffuser. It works perfectly, and when the oil is pure and strong, the aroma fills all my two bedroom apartment. If you look for some quit, relaxing and special moments; don&#x27;t hesitate to pick one for yourself. I use Eden Gardens oils, they are amazing, and last very long. I purchased the 12 collection blend (50$ and free shipping) since last November, and I think I won&#x27;t last out of them, at least, one more year to come.</li>
    <li> Provides many hours of diffusing! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I have had this diffuser for 4 months now and am still immensely please with it!!! I use it daily both at home and at work and it holds up great.</li>
    <li> Love this! I use it very often with my essential oils; works great.</li>
    <li> Ok... usually I don&#x27;t write a review immediately upon receiving a product unless there is something seriously wrong, but in this case I&#x27;m making an exception (and will likely follow up in a few weeks). I&#x27;m still waiting on my oils to arrive, but decided to plug this in and give it a go. Just like some of the other reviewers said, this immediately started putting out mist! The instructions are simple, set up took less than 5 minutes, and it operates super quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser is working great! I&#x27;m using Eden&#x27;s Garden Essential Oils (usually I don&#x27;t mention other products in a review but these are really good). I have had it on every night and have had not issues with the mist, fragrance (I use 4-6 drops), or the auto turn off. It appears that the water lasts about 6 hours and the oils are diffused evenly the entire time. The mist can feel a bit cool if you are really close to it. When the water reservoir gets low you will sometimes here the water (kind of like a very soft sounding ornamental fountain)</li>
    <li> I purchased the mirage diffuser just over a year ago and was initially very happy with the functioning, but less than 6 months later, the misting action was barely working and unit shuts off before the oil has been diffused.  I use high quality essential oils and have tried cleaning it after each use with vinegar/water solution. Unit will work slightly better for a brief time (a few minutes) and then quits. I have contacted ZAQ 4 times and they have not responded. I am very disappointed with ZAQs customer service.  While having difficulty with the Mirage, I purchased the ZAQ Allay, the Paradise and the Lotus models and they all put out MUCH more plume/mist and so far they continue working until all oil/water has been diffused, however, I have only had them 2-3 months, so we&#x27;ll see if they last. I love ZAQ diffusers, while they work, but may need to plan to replace them every 6 months to a year.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that  ZAQ does not stand behind their products and at the very least respond to emails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this diffuser. It works well, i like the colour options. I&#x27;ve used it almost everyday since i bought it (couple weeks) with no problems. Turns off when the water runs out which is perfect. No need to worry about forgetting to turn it off. My room smells wonderful when i use it with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used another diffuser, however I think this one works great. It runs a lot longer than the listing says. The oil doesn&#x27;t last as long as the water and I let the diffuser run until it stops on its own. The water noise is so minimal that its more soothing than annoying (comparing to others reviews). I would like to buy another. If I had any complaints it would be that it is larger than I expected.</li>
    <li> This has been a wonderful product. Paired with lavender oil outer daughters night terrors have ceased.</li>
    <li> Fantastic diffuser!  I purchased this for my wife and there was a LOT of options out there for diffusers.  I chose this one due to simplistic operation (one button does it all), multi colors, filling is much easier than some, and the capacity/run time is larger than most.  Will be buying another one..</li>
    <li> This works really well, but it is quite wide and takes up a lot of room on the surface of my dresser or counter. We also keep the light turned off at night because it is too bright to sleep to.</li>
    <li> This item is quite affordable and well-made. It also works very well and is reliable and easy to use. It works pretty much exactly as advertised, too, except that the water and essential oil in the reservoir last significantly longer than the product description says: 4 or 5 hours rather than 3 or 4. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the second ZAQ that I have bought from Amazon. The first was for myself and the second was for my son and wife, and their two little children.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it because it was a 4 1/2 star on Amazon with over 100 reviews.&lt;br /&gt; I owned a different diffuser (well-known company brand) and it is not the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this and I run it in my salon room with OnGuard oil by doTerra oils.&lt;br /&gt;My clients absolutely love it and Amazon  has probably sold a dozen or so because of this one machine.&lt;br /&gt;Word-of-mouth is 99% of business I believe....&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser!!  It is so quiet, half of the time I forget that it&#x27;s on except for the wonderful smell in my house now!  I live in a duplex and can often smell what the neighbors are cooking, so this is a very nice thing to have in the house. I will probably be ordering another one for the upstairs!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love using this product. I infuse lavender essential oils at night for relaxation and to help me sleep. Works great! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love that this turns off automatically! It is easy to use and works very well.</li>
    <li> I use this diffuser daily and love it.  You can use it with alternating light color, same light, or no light.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews prior to purchasing this diffuser - it has exceeded my expectations!  I have taken the advice given not to put essential oils in it that are resin-based.  I use it nightly with lavendar and other such essential oils to aid in peaceful sleeping.  Absolutely this is a great product.</li>
    <li> This product stopped working and is not longer eligible for return to Amazon or the seller. The product originally had no issues but stopped evaporating water and steam would fall as droplets onto the white base instead of diffussing into the air. Used less than 10 times. Not happy with this purchase at all due to the defect/short shelf life.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with these diffusers. They truly last 8 hours. My last diffuser worked for over a year. They are also very quiet. Just some water trickle sounds. I have used at least 20 different types of diffusers.</li>
    <li> The essential oil doesn&#x27;t really travel so it seems kind of worthless. I don&#x27;t want to just put my nose over it to smell it. I want the room to smell nice. It looks nice and works though.</li>
    <li> Ordered one to try out. and ended up buting another a few weeks later for a friend. I fill it to the top level and it runs for around 7 hours. Totaly quiet with a good volume of mist.</li>
    <li> We use this all the time for our essential oils. The light can be turned on, off, or slowly change colors. My kids all want one in their own rooms now. It will run for about 8 hours and supplies a light mist, that diffuses our oils perfectly without much noise. You can hear a quiet bubbling noise, but its more like quiet white noise. Most of the time I didn&#x27;t even notice that it was making any noise at all.</li>
    <li> I read reviews before purchasing this and many said it lasts from 5-6 hours. I don&#x27;t know why, but mine emits the vapors for 10-11 hours! I fill the water to the water line, put 5-7 drops of essential oils and push the button. It&#x27;s so easy to use and does last long.</li>
    <li> I really hate to put a negative comment. However I do not want others to have the same issue. This diffuser doesn&#x27;t work with essential oils. The amount of mist is very small and I can not smell anything (peppermint &amp; lavender). I have another ZAQ product and it works amazing but its smaller. I don&#x27;t understand how that is possible. Sadly I will return this item only using it for the evening.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I just received my ZAQ Mirage Diffuser today, so I have limited experience. If any issues arise as time goes on, I&#x27;ll be sure to edit my review promptly. If I haven&#x27;t edited it, you can assume it&#x27;s still working as well as ever :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just recently started using essential oils and this is my very first diffuser purchase, so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what I was looking for. I did my research and read many reviews of various diffusers (from the least to most expensive), but kept coming back to this one. What really convinced me to purchase this was the 4.5 star rating out of 214 reviews. That and the cool design. I also liked the fact that this diffuser stays on for a long time. I was a little worried that it would look cheap or poorly put together, but it looks amazing! It&#x27;s smooth &amp; overall cool to look at. The light feature is a nice touch and my 6-year-old brother especially loves watching it change colors. I also like that you can set it to stay on one specific color, or shut off the light entirely while the diffuser continues diffusing. On the Mirage model, the button does NOT glow if you turn the lights off. This makes it perfect to use while sleeping. Another thing I appreciate is the cord length - I hate when cords are super short &amp; this one is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use the diffuser, you first remove the cover on top, then fill the water tank to the water line (you can always put less water if you&#x27;d like it to run for a shorter amount of time). Add a few drops of essential oil into the water, put the cover back on, and you&#x27;re ready to go! Simply plug the adapter in and press the power button. If you press it once, the diffuser turns on with the alternating lights. Press it again and the light will pause, staying lit on whichever color it was on when you pressed it (the diffuser is still on). Press it a third time to keep the diffuser on but turn off the light. And the 4th time you press it will shut it off entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s readyto use right out of the box, which is exactly what I did. One tiny complaint I have is that the lid is SO smooth that it&#x27;s a little hard to get it off...it just slips out of your fingers. I don&#x27;t really mind it, but I just thought I&#x27;d mention it. Anyways, right after opening it, I rinsed it &amp; then added water + 2 drops peppermint + 2 drops lavender + 2 drops lemon. As soon as I turned it on, it started working. I love it! It looks like it&#x27;ll be extremely easy to clean. Definitely happy with this purchase so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more reason why this is a great diffuser is that it doesn&#x27;t heat up! It stays cold/room temp the entire time. Heat and essential oils do not mix - it ruins the benefits you&#x27;d otherwise get.</li>
    <li> I noticed some reviews said the power light stays illuminated even when color lights are off. That is not the case with the 150 ml style. When the setting is with light off there is no light. You can tell it is on if it is in a very quiet place because of the faint water trickle sound. I find it peaceful. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing a review for the mirage model. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t speak for the products durability, as I just got it in the mail today, but I am absolutely in love! For the past 4 yrs or so, I&#x27;ve been using soap stone oil burners to diffuse my essential oils. It took me a while to pick out a brand/model of electric diffuser I wanted b/c there are just so many options but I&#x27;m really happy with this one. The difference in the smell that&#x27;s being released into the room is amazing! And I am facinated that the diffusion is almost instantaneous (like as soon as I hit the power button)! When I mix my essential oils they seem to mingle a lot better better than they had while using my older fashioned diffusers. I personally thinks it smells nicer out of this diffuser. I love the bubbling noice the mirage makes (almost like a fountain). It&#x27;s very quite/relaxing and not obtrusive at all. In fact, I hardly notice it if there are other noices present in the room. I like that I can have the lights on or off and the the power button isn&#x27;t lit (I&#x27;ve read other reviews mentioning that the bright power button on other models was annoying). And last but not least, my 2yr old thinks it&#x27;s awesome! He usually wakes up from his mid day nap super cranky but not today. He gravitated to the mirage as soon as I brought him downstairs b/c he really likes watching the colors cycle (although that will probably change once we&#x27;ve had it for a while. If anything changes, I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review but so far so good!</li>
    <li> This diffuser works like a charm! I have had it for about a month and it has given me no problem. It diffuses a good amount of mist and easily fill my basment room (about 18&#x27;x30&#x27;) with aroma. I dont fill my water up to the line, just a little bit below it, and it will last about 5-6 hours. Which is pretty amazing for how much little water can do. The lights offer you every range of color, having a smooth transition in between each color shift. You can press the button once to stop it at any color you desire. So for example when the red fades into a blue, I stop it at an in between, purple-ish color. You cant go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm- essential oils are readily dispensed in a cool mist. The changing lights are lovely and calming. One complaint: when the lights are turned off, the light around the button still shines, and is light enough I can&#x27;t sleep with it on. Instead I let it run for 15 min while I get ready for bed. Then the dispersed essential oil droplets stay suspended in the air while I sleep. I love to let it run for hours, but 15 min is all you really need.</li>
    <li> This is not my first diffuser, but I will be buying more of this model.  This diffuser scents my entire room and the room is 16&#x27; x 16&#x27; with a very high ceiling--14&#x27;.  The light is mellow and you can turn it off if you want to.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> we use this in a 15x15 room and it smells great. it sometimes runs up to 7 hours on one fill.  i have gotten a lot of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever oil diffuser. In the beginning, I considered buying an electrical  or candle oil warmer.  But, after studying the topic, realized that the mist diffuser is better option in spite of being pricier.  I&#x27;ve received it today and turned it on right away. It gives a good mist, smell  spreads well around my one bedroom apartment. I like the fact that this diffuser changes colors, looks very pretty when it&#x27;s on. Also, mirage diffuser has bigger water capacity and can run longer. I can&#x27;t be happier! This is a great gift option as well!</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit to diffuse oils to calm our hectic household during the school day mornings.  It diffuses wonderfully and fills my rather large family room with scent that then wafts into my kitchen.  It works best in a semi-confined room.  When I used it in my open kitchen, the scent dispersed and was difficult to notice.  My husband felt the unit was rather large.  It is about 3.5in high x 7in x7in.  I tucked it out of way so it&#x27;s not clearly visible but it is obviously there.  I wanted the larger unit because the water oil combination lasts 4 hours.  I didn&#x27;t want to constantly refill the unit.  I use distilled water and have not had to perform any excessive clean up on the unit.  My kids like the alternating colors feature.  I like that you can choose alternating colors, white light, or just turn the light off completely.  I have had it for about two months and had no trouble with it.  It&#x27;s a nice unit. I really enjoy it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> The colors produced by the LEDs are very nice and the operation is quiet.  It performs as advertised.  My only wish is that the stream of diffused water was a bit heavier so it would fill the room more.  The reservoir is almost twice what the other ZAQ diffusers are, per their website.  I&#x27;d definitely buy this again for common use.  If you want a higher-end look this may not be the one for you but it certainly performs and looks as expected for the price.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent diffuser that works very well, and the beautiful colors just make it that much more wonderful!  It diffuses well, and I love the choice of all of the different colored lights (or the choice to have no light at all)!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I just started using my ZAQ mirage, and, so far, I&#x27;m thrilled with it! To be honest, when I first opened the package, my first reaction was, \\&quot;This is it!!??\\&quot; It is flimsy, cheap looking plastic. I expected at least part of it to be ceramic, or at the very least something more..... substantial. I was disappointed and almost put it back in the box to send it back. I&#x27;m very glad that I decided to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;  First of all - it works. You immediately get puffs of fragrant steam that fill the room. The steam, thankfully, is not hot and the zaq stays cool. It is a very efficient diffuser. I got the mirage version specifically because it holds the most water and lasts the longest.&lt;br /&gt;  The added bonus - it is SO PRETTY!! I was looking for a high quality diffuser, and I got a pretty light show to go along with it!! I think the lighting aspect is the reason the plastic seems so flimsy. It is made SPECIFICALLY to enhance the colored lights. When it&#x27;s working, you can see that it was crafted carefully. The plastic needs to be light and ceramic would not cut it. This is not junk. The person responsible for the zaq has got to be a very capable engineer. Kudos to whover created the zaq - it really is a work of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS TIP - If you have a cat, the MIRAGE model is the best one for you. It is flattish and sort of looks like a manta ray, so your cat won&#x27;t tip it over with his or her butt while rubbing up against it. Of course, kitty will still be able to push it off a table. We all know kitties can push over twice their body weight when they want to. If you keep your mirage on the floor, kitty will be pretty safe with it. One of the best aspects of the zaq is that it stays cool, and even the vapor is cool, so no one will get burned.</li>
    <li> I love how long it runs.  Great diffuser.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and fantastic product!</li>
    <li> glad I spent a little more and purchased this Mirage by ZAQ! granted,it&#x27;s brand new so I have no idea how it will last,but right out of the gate,it is REALLY nice.very good diffusing of scents and the colourful display is delightful.i recommend this item for doing what it&#x27;s meant to do with panache and hopefully,with reliability.will update if any problems develop.i am impressed:)</li>
    <li> Before ordering this item I did my research by reading all of the comments for essential oil diffuser.  This diffuser has 150ml reservoir and runs for 8 hours. It is very simple to use. The footprint of diffuser 8x8x4.5 inches does not match to the dimensions provided in the Product Description 6x8x6. That is confusing if one depends on the size of the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used KIS Oil Aromatherapy oils, it works fine so far. I&#x27;ll be ordering the 80ml size diffuser version of same brand, since this one does not fit at my available space in the bath room.</li>
    <li> Works well helps me breath better when using Lemon, Eucalyptus, and Peppermint</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter as a gift and she loves it.  Good price and good find.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this product. I don&#x27;t get the feel that this product really dispurses the oils as good as my old young living diffuser does.</li>
    <li> Relatively new to essential oil diffusing scene, I have tried a few other diffusers before purchasing this one.  I purchased this as an extra one for my large living room.  After realizing how great it was, I got rid of the others and keep one in the living room and one in the bedroom.  In the living room, I keep it on from the time I get home from work until time for bed, using pleasant fragrances along with essential oils that are relevant to my current situations (headaches, stress, etc.) and my whole house smells great.  I always receive positive feedback from visitors, asking me what is making my house smell so great!  In my bedroom, I mostly use lavender oil and chamomile to assist with my sleeping problems.  I take diphenhydramine, melatonin, valerian root, magnesium, among other things to assist with sleeping, along with four fans on and two sleeping machines.  After placing this in my bedroom, I have been sleeping much better and feeling substantially more relaxed.  One of the great things about this diffuser is the fact it can last ten hours or longer before running out.  I turn it on an hour or two before going to sleep, and manually turn it off upon waking up.  The first time you hit the power button, it starts with a white light and gradually changes to a plethora of colors.  If you hit the power button a second time, the color of light will stay the color that it was on when you hit it.  A third time turns the light off.  I almost always have the light off.  When the light is off, this diffuser produces NO light which is important to me when trying to sleep.  Hitting the power button a fourth time turns this diffuser off.  I have yet to have any problems with it turning off prematurely like all other diffusers, even with excessive essential oil added.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it everyday! This paired with a collection of amazing oils is just wonderful.</li>
    <li> I had done a lot of research on this defuser before I made the purchase. I can say after using this produce to defuse essential oil that this is one of the best defuser products available.</li>
    <li> As described, works great!</li>
    <li> Easy to fill and diffuses for over 8 hours.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser! So easy to use and great for sleeping!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous. And quiet. The colors are nice. I like that you can set it for multi color, one color, or no color. I may have opted for a taller one. I didn&#x27;t consider how flat and wide this would be. But overall no complaints. no leaks etc. You will smell your oils immediately.</li>
    <li> I love the design but worked 20 minutes and quit had to send  it back .I bought another a few months ago by well something and it worked great for a month.and quit right after warranty was over.</li>
    <li> I love this item and use it everyday for aromatherapy in my home! My husband told me that this was the best investment I have ever made. He works night shift and often has a difficult time relaxing and sleeping during the day. I just put a few drops of lavender essential oil in my mirage and he falls asleep easily. I also love the gentle light show that this item provides. I know when it is time to refill because my mirage shuts itself off when empty. If is easy to fill and refill.</li>
    <li> Light broke after a week.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! We use it everyday. Very easy to use and clean up and leaves no mess at all. You just lift the lid, add water and EO and put the top back on and turn it on. I love the light show that comes with it too.</li>
    <li> Takes up entirely too much space for what it is.  Unless you have a modern style living space in which it will accent or be a centerpiece then go for style elsewhere.  Only effective at diffusing scent while it is on.  Several cans of high quality artisan room spray would do better for a pleasant lingering scent.</li>
    <li> This is the second ZAQ diffuser that I&#x27;ve purchased. I also have the Noor diffuser and love it. I like this one too but I think I like the Noor one a little more. I have tried several other diffusers and the ZAQ ones are superior to the others I&#x27;ve tried. I feel like they diffuse essential oils and scent into the room really well. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with either one and I&#x27;ve had them almost a year. I like that the Mirage holds more water and will last longer but I feel like the oil and scent may diffuse a bit unevenly and at the end of the cycle, I don&#x27;t really notice the scent as much (and I don&#x27;t think it just me getting used to it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend the ZAQ brand diffusers. I love them so much I bought a second Noor. I love the light up color changing feature. I feel like they add so much to my house. I love my diffusers!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Easy to use and works great.  The seller ships quickly.  Easy transaction.  I loved it so much I purchased one for my Mom and she loves it too.  We both usually use Scentsy products but for some reason lately it seems like they don&#x27;t give off as much smell or last as long as they used to.  These are much easier and definately more economical.  Now the challenge is findings scents that you like!</li>
    <li> The product stopped working after few days. Tried contacting the company and the seller, but no response from any of them. If you deride to buy these products and if it stops working (most likely), you are out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish their customer service and product was as good as the concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you are better of looking for alternative products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed experimenting  with various oils; recently I had a sinus infection and added eucalyptus and cinnamon oils for their therapeutic effects.  I also slept with it on all night. Normally a sinus infection would last 7-10 days; for the first time it lasted about 5 days and less intense. I have recomended it to many.  Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it almost every day.  At night, I turn off the light display, but during the day, I like it on.  It works great!</li>
    <li> love the color and mist coming out but doesn&#x27;t have any oil scent. I use young living products and i put many many drops in it and i still can&#x27;t smell it. disappoitning :(</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my sister. She loves it! I need an extra diffuser and will be getting myself one of these. I will also be getting one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> Thought this was something I needed.  Used with lavender oil.  Smelled great for the first 10 minutes and then it was over.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Looks like a UFO. Changes colors or can be locked into favorite color, or no color at all. The mist is strong and flows like a volcano. I recommend buying some reputable, good quality, water soluble aromatherapy oil and the scent will flow beautifully into the surrounding space.</li>
    <li> I use it regularly since I live in a house that is nearly 80 years old but it works very well.  Love the colors for me and the Mrs.</li>
    <li> I like the ease of operation.. Also like that it&#x27;s run time can be adjusted by the amount of water you put in.</li>
    <li> Nice lighting but little capacity of water. The manual did not really mention about caution of running it without water in the container. I do not know the answers of that yet and I do not want to test it. It would break off the unit or might something happen to it. Other than that I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before ordering this unit. The Litemist looks exactly like the picture,it performs exactly as described. It&#x27;s a light mist that streams from the hole at the top. It&#x27;s easy to fill as the top lifts off,water line is visible and accessible. Pop your essential oil in after you fill with water, plug it in, click the button the disired number of times, presto it&#x27;s working. The noise is very faint from the mist/motor, therefore wouldn&#x27;t interupt me if I used it while I slept. Coverage area for the mist/aroma is good. You would need a couple of units if you had a large open room, however that&#x27;s a no brainer really. Would I buy this product again, definitely yes, as I love everything about, just hope it keeps on puffing away for a long time, otherwise I&#x27;ll write another review.  BTW I&#x27;m in Australia so I had to buy a voltage converter, this was approx $10 from the hardware store, again no real issue.</li>
    <li> This is one of 3 diffusers I got from ZAQ. I do like the other two diffusers I got from them which were smaller, the Allay and noor. I really like the slim Allay as well as the way the vapor comes out of the allay, like an elegant stream of cool mist.This Mirage diffuser is quite big so be sure to look at the measurements before you buy. The unit I got would not work so I returned it right away. Seller was very prompt at refunding my money.</li>
    <li> This thing is great!  Works perfectly and looks cool too.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love it, but it is beginning to slow down, so I am worried about it.  I liked it so much I ordered one for a friend and shipped it to them.  I am afraid to ask.    My experience with another diffuser, has not been good, found out it is too late to send back so I am stuck with it.  Have been looking on internet for an answer to to repair it and have come up with nothing.    If this ZAQ Mirage LiteMist lasts a year I will be satisfied and buy another just like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent - seems to run more than 4 hours.</li>
    <li> works only for 5 minutes. I add 10-12 drops of eucalyptus oil. But it didn&#x27;t work for more than 5 mins. I increased to 20 drops. Same result</li>
    <li> This was a little larger than I thought but it is perfect.  In fact, I ordered one for my sister too.  It will actually go throug the night and it automatically shuts off when the water is out!</li>
    <li> Love, love this unit!  It worked right away.  I just wish I could find a larger one for larger rooms.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser!  It&#x27;s reservoir is very large and holds enough water to last approximately 8 hours.  I love that the light feature can be shut off, completely.  Would definitely purchase another one!</li>
    <li> Disperses scent MUCH better than my candle and dish heater.  I put about twice the drops of oil recommended and the whole house smells REALLY good haha.  Looks beautiful.  Got on gold box for forty.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Easy to use.  Nice for a bedroom or small room.</li>
    <li> I have had this diffuser for a bit more than a year. When it worked, it did a decent job. Now 13 months down the road it just died. I&#x27;ve contacted the ZAQ customer service and they only asked me what it was wrong with it. After I responded back and just inquired on the warranty, they just went quite on me. So much for ZAQ&#x27;s customer service. I took it apart just to see what happened and discovered that inside was a cheap construction with no waterproof insulation. Quite dangerous. There is  a small vent on the edge of the water container where the water can easily get inside and either fry the circuit or worse electrocute someone. Stay way from this one.</li>
    <li> I really loved this diffuser for the brief time that it worked. I used it for two weeks, and I loved the smell of essential oils in my home. I used it with care, however, after two weeks, it completely stopped working. Don&#x27;t waste your money; get a different diffuser that will work longer than two weeks.</li>
    <li> Great diffuser! It is very quiet, and delivers a nice, cool mist - ideal for people with pets/children.</li>
    <li> Works great at diffusing my essential oils!</li>
    <li> IT IS VERY GOOD. TO ME IT COVERS AN BIG AREA WITH GOOD ESSENTIAL OILS. WHICH HELPS DIFFUSER I LIKE EDEN GARDEN OILS.</li>
    <li> works great, really happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Love it! I have had no problems with it and I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> This review is for the \\&quot;Mirage\\&quot; (the one that looks like a manta ray and not the dew drop mistakenly pictured here on Amazon). I liked it okay at first, but eventually had to return it, which I&#x27;ll get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I was somewhat underwhelmed when I took it out of the box. I couldn&#x27;t help but feel, \\&quot;This is it?\\&quot; Fortunately, it seemed to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It&#x27;s very quiet, EASY to use (no need to really look at the little instruction booklet included), with just the faintest bubbling sound, which to me was peaceful and relaxing. Usually, I didn&#x27;t even really take notice of this, and I do have my sound threshold issues. The colored lights cycled nicely in the same order over and over, fading from one color to the next. For instance, red fades to purple with a brief intermediary color between the two, so there is always seamless color of some shade. There was a mist, and you could smell the essential oils. The outer machine stays cool, but I did notice the bubbling water inside sometimes got rather warm. The mist was always cool though, but hardly deserves to be considered a humidifier. I suppose after 8 hours it must add some moisture to the air. Adding oils like ravensara, sage, peppermint, tea tree, camphor, lemon balm, eucalyptus etc. is great for clearing the lungs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it would be great for large rooms. I used it in a small study, which was fine. I also think it would have worked well on my nightstand since it would have been close to my nose, although I never got around to using it for sleep. The mist that rises from the hole at the top is not much bigger than a meager plume, so if you think your room will be pumped full of heavenly-scented vapors, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. If you are truly desiring a really strong, room-saturating scent, it may be better for you to use fragrance oils rather than the more subtle essential oils. I did use a honeysuckle fragrance oil once, which the machine diffused well. The honeysuckle definitely filled the room and was very strong. When I would use essential oils (my preference), the power of the scent was related to which essential oil(s) I chose. Some are just stronger (geranium and ylang ylang) than others (ambrette and cistus), so don&#x27;t be disheartened if your initial essential oil choice isn&#x27;t satisfying (simply add a little more oil for the ones that need it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had a water/oil reservoir that you could lift out for cleaning. With this model, it&#x27;s built in. Cleaning it well involves unplugging it and taking it to a sink because it can be a little messy. I would add vinegar to the reservoir to remove the build up of oils. I did this daily, although I did run the Mirage quite often (at least 8 hours per day). I also changed the type of oil frequently, which requires removing past residues that have built up so as not to affect the current scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are basically three separate parts: the plug, the base, and the lid. That&#x27;s it (and the box and tiny manual). It is very, VERY light. The slightest bump, and it slides significantly and easily across a smooth desktop. So, if the lid is off (while you&#x27;re adding oil) and you bump it even just barely, water can sometimes slosh out onto your table surface since the reservoir isn&#x27;t that deep. I swear, when it&#x27;s empty of water, it felt like you could almost blow on it, and it would move. They could have made it a little weightier. This makes it seem flimsy, especially for $60. It does seem to last a rather long time with just a small amount of water. The scent slightly lessens after running awhile, so adding a few more drops is sometimes necessary. It never failed to shut itself off when the water/oil reservoir emptied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, (this may sound like nit picking), one of my favorite colors is orange. This is not one of the main colors it features (Clear, Red, Purplish, Blue, Light Blue, Green, Yellow). You cannot dim the colors to lessen their brightness (although you can shut them off completely with the mist still running). You can pause on whatever color you like as it cycles, and it will stay at that shade. It kind of annoyed me that when I&#x27;d freeze it on a color as it cycled and ended up not preferring that particular color choice, I&#x27;d have to turn it completely off and back on in order to start the cycle of colors again to make a new choice. Not really a big deal, I guess. I wish that when you paused it at a color and didn&#x27;t like it, you could start the cycle from right where you had paused it. I did enjoy the look of how the underbelly of it glows with color just as the top funnel part does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, an okay item that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do fairly. With a bit more attention to some of the details I mentioned, especially considering its price, it could have been a lot better. After less than a month, the LED lights stopped working correctly, and there was no longer any blue or purple color. So, back it went.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good diffuser.  I bought it for our living room but I think it may be too small.  I do like the fact that it holds more water than smaller diffusers so it obviously goes longer.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this diffuser. I have had others but this is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> NOT a Essential Oil Diffuser. Oil must be purchased separately and MUST be water soluble, per the recommended pamphlet instructions. Otherwise the diffuser can get clogged. I had all kinds of oils to try, but didn&#x27;t.  I returned the item as the description was incomplete; and finding water soluble oils was an expensive proposition.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the smell of the essential oils I put in. this product is easy to use and it is great that it turns off when out of water.I also like that it holds more water than some models</li>
    <li> This is my favorite diffuser. I have both styles. They diffuse for hours so it&#x27;s perfect for falling asleep. Love that you can turn the light off if you like.</li>
    <li> Runs longer at times then they say. Calming and stable because of shape.</li>
    <li> So nice and easy to use...love the way it diffuses quietly and with or without the light on...use it all the time!</li>
    <li> I love this. I have it running practically round the clock for use with Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils, and especially appreciate that it is easy to clean and fill, lasts for hours, fills my room with a lovely scent, and in general is an aesthetically pleasing product.  I bought it in October and so far I have had no problems with it. The previous diffuser I got broke after a year (of very heavy use) so I hope this one lasts longer. I am considering buying more for other rooms in my house, since this is also very well-priced for the quality.  All in all, very highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is the best diffuser I own.  I have several, most were more expensive than this one.  I have purchased several of these as gifts.  The scent is immediately noticeable and it is a pretty unit to display.  Very easy to fill and use, unlike the doTerra diffuser.  If you are new to diffusing, try this product.  I think you&#x27;ll be pleased you didn&#x27;t spend the money on a more expensive one, assuming it would be better.  The doTerra oils are very good, just not thrilled about their diffuser.  The roll-on oils they sell are really nice too.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I did A LOT of research before I finally ordered this diffuser and I love it!  I love that it holds more water than most of the other diffusers and will go for 8+ hours. A few months later I ordered the Riverock by Deneve because it had the most positive reviews of all diffusers. The ZAQ is WAY better, in my opinion. The Riverock doesn&#x27;t diffuse as long and I really don&#x27;t like how you turn it on and off. It&#x27;s not bad, I just don&#x27;t like!</li>
    <li> I have purchased raw Shea butter previously in a brick form.  I love the convenience of the bottle and it&#x27;s not messy like the block of Shea butter. I love the quality of this one, it feels smoother than the other one.  I make diaper salves with Shea butter as one of my primary ingredients.  No more diaper rash for my grandson! I also make lip salves for me with Shea butter as the primary ingredient, add a bit of mineral colour and castor oil for shine and I&#x27;ve got a dynamite mousurizing lip gloss!&lt;br /&gt;A teeny bit goes a long way and this is a very large bottle.  For most people this will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I like this device, it looks nice and the color changing feature is cool. However, I find that essential oils diffused through this product are hard to smell. I have a 14&#x27;x12&#x27; room and even if I use 12 drops of oil (way higher than the recommended 3-5 drops) the smell often doesn&#x27;t spread far from the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I can&#x27;t be confident if any other diffuser would do a better job, this type of process might just spread the scent in a smaller area than I expected.</li>
    <li> I got this on 7/22/14 and as of 10/21/14 the lights burned out. It still diffuses and does a nice job of that but I partly bought it as a night light so I&#x27;m disappointed. It hasn&#x27;t been mistreated and actually hasn&#x27;t even been used much, maybe a total of 40 hours.    UPDATE: 10/28/14  Well, it wasn&#x27;t easy finding a way to contact them through Amazon. All roads lead back to Amazon but I finally was able to send them an email and got an immediate response. All they wanted was my original invoice and they are replacing the unit. Couldn&#x27;t be happier as I really like the unit.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:2fc1b937d19f60ec74ede0b5c29782f1]]Bigger than I thought. But I suppose it&#x27;s also a good thing that it provides a steady foothold. Simple. Works like a charm. Very quiet. In fact, no sound at all. Perfect for a good night sleep. The colors are beautiful, especially in dark.    The only downside is that you have to handle with care not to knock it off balance while it&#x27;s filled with water. The well is shallow and water can spill out. There is a slit on the side of the rim (facing outward). If water somehow spills over it (which isn&#x27;t that rare a chance if you move it around with water in it) and trickles into the opening, there is a risk of damage. Also, the power button on the body isn&#x27;t protected from water spill either.    Overall I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it. I&#x27;ve only used it for two nights. Will see how it lasts.</li>
    <li> I bought this diffuser for eucalyptus oil when my husband and I both had a terrible bronchitis... but also for other essential oil uses.  We don&#x27;t use the lights but my grandsons did and it keep them interested enough to stick around for the full benefit of the oil.  With very little water it lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s much more attractive than a typical humidifier.  I use it ALL the time.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my daugther. She loves it and uses it a lot</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.  Stays on for a long time but uses all the oil in just about an hour.</li>
    <li> Ours just came in today, so we tested it out with some Peace &amp; Calming before bedtime.  It works very well; my wife was starting to nod off before the show we were watching was halfway finished.  It is a bit larger than I was expecting, but we found a place for it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product back in July for my fiancee as she has fallen in love with Essential Oils. After about a month (4-5 weeks) the diffuser suddenly stopped working. I had seen other people comment on similar issues/occurrences and hoped if i only used a few drops of oil that i wouldn&#x27;t have that issue. Sadly i did, and when i reached out to the company. They said that they are the importer of the item and while it was purchased through Amazon and not directly through them, they would make an exception and replace the item. However, unlike most companies that I feel I deal with, they requested i pay for packing and shipping of the defective product. That seemed odd, but regardless i did it. Despite having shipped the product back over a week and a half ago, there&#x27;s been no contact from them. Just seems poorly organized and sketchy, and the product only lasted a month. I thought i&#x27;d done enough research to find a great diffuser, but starting to believe there may be better ones out there.</li>
    <li> So beautiful and I love the way it functions. Has great color options, and I love that it shuts off by itself when it runs out of water. I would recommend it. You just need the right pure oils to get it to work efficiently.</li>
    <li> This is my new best friend! I love it! Great product and is easy to work!</li>
    <li> A really awesome addition to my music studio. Now I smell orange blossoms 24/7. Heaven. It also looks really cool with the color changing LEDs inside. Looks like a little white flying saucer. I&#x27;m a lifer now. Aromatherapy rocks with this little guy!</li>
    <li> Love this product so much we bought two! Fast arrival and well packaged! Would definitely order from here again!</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser. I use it in my little girls&#x27; room and it pulls double duty as a nightlight and to diffuse essential oils to help the girls sleep.</li>
    <li> works great! it is much bigger than I thought it was going to be. Easy to clean and add oil and water to.</li>
    <li> This mister works like a charm. I use it in my therapy office as well as on my night table with my essential oils and it calms and relaxes the mind and body</li>
    <li> The changing lights are nice and it lasts several hours.</li>
    <li> This had been a wonderful diffuser until it completely quite working.  I purchased it on July 11 and it died on October 9.  It lasted three months.  If you purchase one, keep the box, the warranty information.  You&#x27;ll probably need it.</li>
    <li> Nice diffuser! Works like it should and I love the color light options as well!</li>
    <li> Lights are pretty works good</li>
    <li> This product is a Christmas Gift, so I really do not know that much about it</li>
    <li> Threw away the candles and plugins and got this instead.. Wow what a difference! A few drops of your favorite oil and distilled water, and your house will smell amazing. I&#x27;d say the smell spreads through a large room quite well. I love the colors and the different modes.</li>
    <li> Works great! Definitely recommend this diffuser.</li>
    <li> i purchased the Mirage for its capacity..i needed a large capacity diffuser to put in my bedroom to run all night.. and boy this one does!! i am even more excited that the lights can be turned off and it is completely dark. most other models ive seen still has the power button lit..  very happy!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this thing!  The scent fills a decent sized living room well.  I suggest experimenting with essential oils and DO NOT use generic scents that are not essential oils.  Cleans easily and is always asked about by guests.</li>
    <li> I had previously owned a few different brands of diffusers that stopped working after a few weeks, so I waited several months before reviewing this one. Cared for properly, I&#x27;ve had no issues with my ZAQ diffuser. We&#x27;re purchasing a second for my child&#x27;s room, we&#x27;ve loved this one so much. I love that you can set it for just mist, one color light, or rotating colors. It makes efficient use of a few drops of oil, so I don&#x27;t have to waste my precious essential oils. The shape (we have the one that looks like a ufo) helps keep it from tipping and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it spilling or anything, even when my curious 3 year old is around.</li>
    <li> I received one Mirage Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser to review!  This diffuser is really AWESOME and I would highly recommend it!  I absolutely love it! I love being able to put any scent of essential oil in it!  Did you know that Aromatherapy is very popular as a treatment for relieving stress?  Even hospitals are using aromatherapy to relax their patients.  Aromatherapy works on the central nervous system to relieve depression, anxiety and stress.  Just walking into a room that has a pleasant aroma is always relaxing and very enjoyable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mirage Diffuser is one of the finest energy efficient diffusers available, it will provide enchanting aromas that distribute evenly.  It will improve air quality by ionizing and humidifying.  Just imagine coming home each day to sit back and unwind, while bathed in scents you love.  Your mind can drift and your body can rest, while your skin is soothed by the moisturizing caress of water vapors.  Relaxing with a Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser is perfect for a little &amp;#34;ME&#x27; time or meditations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The craftsmanship of the Mirage Diffuser is excellent and the vibrant LED colors that it provides are beautiful, plus you can add your favorite essential oil!  It&#x27;s made with durable materials, sleek and compact shape to enjoy in every room in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review on Quick Tattletails and enter the giveaway!</li>
    <li> love this diffuser; diffuses my favorite oils and fills the room with wonderful aromas!</li>
    <li> Worked fine for a week. Then the lights just started flickering and changing and then no longer put out the mist. Now it won&#x27;t turn on at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few weeks but so far I am really pleased with my purchase. Works well and puts out a good amount of essential oils. Took a while to ship, but I did receive it by the promised date. I have contacted the manufacturer in regards to the best water to use in the diffuser, and they emailed me back the next day with an answer that distilled water is best and will extend the life of your machine. Instructions read fill with tap water which is why I contacted them.</li>
    <li> I was pretty pleased for the first 8 months but then the motor slowed down and it stopped sending out the vapor. No longevity with this item.</li>
    <li> Kinda big and very plasticky. It works well but not a fan of the design.</li>
    <li> We loved it were getting ready to get another and then it just stopped working</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t maintain the oil scent in the home.  fades after an hour or so.  returned.</li>
    <li> I actually do not hate this diffuser, but I hate that it only lasted three months before it died. I loved that the diffuser would run almost all night long, which is why I bought it. I&#x27;m sad that after only three months it no longer works. I cleaned it regularly, and didn&#x27;t over fill it. Just really really disappointed.</li>
    <li> This item is a champ.  It lasts easily 8 hours and I have had it for 6+ plus months before I posted this review and use it daily and it just keeps on working.  I would definately buy it again.</li>
    <li> We love it. For six months it has put out a perfect vapor. The light transitions are the perfect night light.</li>
    <li> Very nice appearance.  Doesn&#x27;t have the same or as many operating options as does the Quooz Lull.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling. Lasts 12 to 13 hrs. However use new bottles of aromatherapy as old ones don&#x27;t smell as strong.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product! I love this diffuser! Great seller. Prompt delivery! A+++++++!!!!!</li>
    <li> The smoke and lighting effect is pretty cool. The scent does spread and lasts long as long as its running. One nice feature also is that it turns off automatically when there is no more water.</li>
    <li> I love it.  My daughter hasit and liked it so much I thought  I would give it a try.  The changing light at night is so pretty and it&#x27;s so quiet you can&#x27;t even hear it.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone considering buying a diffuser.</li>
    <li> No problems. Works great. I have had it for 3 days and I have used it every day since with no issues</li>
    <li> Puts out a wonderful smell. The lights r beautiful. Great therapy. I have purchased 3 of these. I gave one away.Great way to relax with the lights. I mix a couple of drops of eucalyptus and several drops of peppermint and the smell is wonderful. Last up to 10 hours. I was told to mix tangerine with this, would be even better. I think I like these better than candles. Thanks I hope it last, these r new to me.</li>
    <li> Loved it, while it worked.  Three months after receiving it as a gift and it stopped working.  NOT happy.  Too expensive to break that soon....</li>
    <li> Thus far I have had no issues with this product. I&#x27;ve had several people note how great my place smells when i&#x27;ve recently had this running. I find that it runs well past the 6-7 hours I typically sleep as I often use lavender oil in it. It is nice for the lighting but can also be ran without which is good as I like dark to sleep.</li>
    <li> Good diffuser. Just wish that it can be kept more clean. Good bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> My son got this for Christmas and has had it going every night in his room.  Somehow water got inside and it quit working.  When I took it apart, everything seemed to be in the right place but the gasket apparently wasn&#x27;t quite big enough to keep moisture out.  We&#x27;ll be replacing it with another Mirage, most likely, so hopefully this isn&#x27;t a &#x27;thing&#x27; with this model.</li>
    <li> Nicer looking than all the others Ive seen.</li>
    <li> I love the looks of this diffuser and how easy it is to use and clean.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!</li>
    <li> Amazing little machine.  It is bigger that the pictures make it look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unsure about putting oil in water to diffuse it, but the results are just awesome.  It has taken a little experimenting, but the results are great.  No more getting a &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; smell if the candle diffuser is too hot.  The water vapor is cold and brings the oil out in the air in a manner that is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion to new users: Start with one drop of your oil, one may be enough.  Add as needed from there.</li>
    <li> It is an awesome diffuser</li>
    <li> Love the liteMist diffurser... works extremely well. I like hhow it gently hydrates the air and I have actually have been able to sleep better.... Thank You so much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this diffuser. Not only does it seem to diffuse just the right amount, I like the color changes or the option to select just one color.  Also cleanup on it is very easy.  Filling the cup inside full will give you about 3 hours or so of diffusing.</li>
    <li> This is honestly a great diffuser no regrets simple easy to clean I live in the desert in phx so I just use distilled water to keep it in top notch conditions.</li>
    <li> Works great. Ready to get another.</li>
    <li> I spent quite a bit of time researching diffusers and for the money, the is the best. The soothing way it rotates between colors and it&#x27;s excellent dispersal of the essential oils you add is amazing. I have run this thing for 8 or so hours a day for the last 3 weeks and it has been wonderful. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great diffuser - works perfectly!!</li>
    <li> Lasts for hours and hours. Smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Worked fine, but it is loud. I returned it.</li>
    <li> It runs for 6hr-8hrs.I like the color changes.Great for the price.</li>
    <li> Loved this diffuser when I first got it. Worked great for the first two weeks, but then the light stopped working. After about a few months of using it, the diffuser stopped working completely. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this diffuser -- I higher recommend going with a different diffuser.</li>
    <li> Works well. Nice little nightlight for our two toddler boys. Oldest one enjoys &amp;#34;pressing the button&amp;#34; at bedtime.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is aesthetically pleasing, works quietly, and diffuses for a very long time (up to 12 hours in my large house)! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I just received my diffuser yesterday and already I love it!  I would say that the website does provide dimensions, but I have to say this was a bit larger than I expected it to be.  It is going on the nightstand by my bed, so it takes up a good bit of room on the table top.  With that being said though, I definitely wanted a unit that would hold a bit more water, so I see the size of this as the swap out to having a unit that will run longer/hold more water, than some of the smaller models.  I enjoy the changing colors of the lights and being able to &#x27;freeze&#x27; the unit on whichever color I choose.  I&#x27;m fascinated by the little trail of &#x27;smoke&#x27; that comes from the unit (how does it do that?!).  It sure does look cool!  The unit does a great job at dispersing the scented oil that I have added to the water.  I&#x27;m already planning to buy one of the smaller units to place in my office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does make a bit of sound when it is running, both from the unit running as well as hearing a slight bubbling of the water.  If you are planning to use this in your bedroom while you sleep, and you need dead silence, this background sound will likely bother you.  On the other hand, if you enjoy background noise such as a fan or a white noise machine, this unit will do the trick and you may find the noise soothing.  I personally find it very peaceful and it reminds me of being at a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to my next purchase from Zaq.</li>
    <li> I love ZAQ diffusers. It is the only one I haven&#x27;t returned. Runs great day/night in my son&#x27;s room.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic, looks like an alien space ship and works for about 30 minutes of whatever.  I&#x27;d rather use a simple oil based scent with a few sticks in it to provide the aroma.  My brother said it looked like an oversized butt plug.  LOL.  No, wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it! It works great!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the ZAQ Mirage Diffuser! I use it to diffuse my Young Living oils. I&#x27;ve used some of the diffusers sold by YL in the past, and I would not hesitate to choose this over those. It works beautifully, and it&#x27;s sold for less! I rely on reviews like this one to choose products, and I compared dozens of diffusers for HOURS before ultimately deciding on this one. I made the right choice! I love everything about it!</li>
    <li> This was my first diffuser purchase and I love it! It works great and the led lights are so soothing! I have had no issues with this diffuser like I have heard about some of the other diffusers so all in all I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now... and let me say, this diffuser is by far the best of all that I&#x27;ve bought and tried (6 different units in total)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts the FULL 8 hours per fill that it claims to, something I&#x27;ve found less than accurate with other diffusers / brands. It&#x27;s able to diffuse citrus oils just as well as any other, which puts it above half of the competition for having that ability alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are a little funny, but it&#x27;s nice to be able to hold it at any given color to best accent the mood or mirror other decor in the room. If this is important to you, I dont think you can find a better looking more attractive diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this thing all day and all night, diffuse various blends of my Doterra essential oils depending on what i&#x27;m doing (sleeping, needing to focus on work, or other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It packs up really easy and cleans up fast to take anywhere and everywhere you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken it to hotels with me on business trips and will leave it running so the room is smelling great when I return. Literally, there are times when my room has been over 30 doors down the hallway, and I&#x27;m able to smell the essential oil I was diffusing immediately as I step off the elevator. This thing kicks a**. You wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I received this diffuser in perfect condition. Over the years I have invested in a number of different essential oil diffusers, and this is my FAVORITE by far. I love the design which compliments my kitchen decor. I diffuse 5 drops of essential oil daily to help eliminate pathogens in the air, especially during the fall and winter months. It runs ALL DAY. This is a 5-star product.</li>
    <li> Diffuser stopped working after 2 months. Contacted Zaq but no reply, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Easy to refill and runs a long time.  My favorite mister, and I have several different kinds.</li>
    <li> Item works &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but unit is very flimsy. Contacted company to replace a part via amazon &amp; their website, 2 months ago and did not hear back. Disappointing quality and no customer service.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these. One of them is working fine. The other one ran for 9 hours straight the very first night of use. This was odd as it is only meant to run around 6 hours. Every night since, it will not turn off, but is still running 9 hours later with water in it (although mist appears to be coming out). Also, it barely leaves the scent of oil although I use very high quality oil. Please let me know how to solve this problem or I will be returning it and never buying another ZAQ product. I have very low expectations for the other one I purchased that is working when this one had problems the very first night of use.</li>
    <li> Great little diffuser. We put this in our boy&#x27;s room and works great, and the light makes a great nite lite for them. Good price, too.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for the ZAQ, but after only 4.5 months the diffuser has stopped working.  I have meticulously cleaned it according to the product guidelines and it just died on me.  Now I am beyond the return deadline so I&#x27;m stuck with an almost $60 diffuser that is broken.  I do not recommend this product.  NOW works better - I have that one too.</li>
    <li> I bought the ZAQ Mirage diffuser and the Deneve Riverock Essential Oil Diffuser at the same time for the house and the office. I was originally going to use the  ZAQ for the office but it has a larger footprint than I would have expected. They seemed to put out comparable amounts of diffused oil but the ZAQ has a larger reservoir than the Riverrock so it lasts roughly 2 to 3 hours longer at a sitting. They were both just under $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both allow you to turn off the colored lights so it could be just Aromoatherapy (GREAT feature for my Migraine Headaches). If you want the colored light, I recommend the ZAQ. Though the Riverrock does have it, it is much more subtle. I will use this one in my bedroom in the event I want the light, I will want it subtle. In the office, the brighter light will be more acceptable. Admittedly, I originally bought them for the opposites spaces based on footprint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Riverrock comes with a small watering cup which is quite handy and I am surprised the ZAQ does not... especially considering the price is the same. Why the 4 out of 5 stars? Mostly price for the quality of the unit... Given their construction, I would have put them both at the $35 to $40 retail price rather than a $50 price tag. However, based on reviews of the Aromatherapy diffusers, these two had the better ratings and many in the $35 range seemed to stop working within 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in 6 months and let you know if one or both are still working.</li>
    <li> So far this has been great.  It diffuses for 10 hours which is so convenient!  I do love this diffuser, but I originally gave it 2 stars after purchasing 2 just like it that quit working (one after a few months and one after a few days.)  My husband and I each have one on our night stands and we diffuse all night.  I&#x27;m trusting this one will keep working....</li>
    <li> This looks like it is probably nice but it is huge. I had to return it because I didn&#x27;t have a place to put it. It measures 8x8x4.</li>
    <li> I love that this aromatherapy mist system runs for at least 10 hours, automatically shuts off,and you can have the colors change constantly, or you can pick one color or not at all, as it runs.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several months now. They way I use this is to fill DISTILLED water to the line and put a drop of an essential oil on the top of the water. The aroma fills the room perfectly. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this unit. The light is awesome, adjustable. You can let it slowly cycle through the colors, stop on a color, or let it run with no light. It is light weight and looks nice.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of the LiteMist. I have one I love, so I bought the second one as a gift. I&#x27;ve had it for quite awhile and it keeps ticking along. I use a variety of oils in it and I love the changing light. It also puts a tiny bit of cool moisture in the air which is good for the dry winters of the northeast. It really does a great job of freshening the air without the sickly smell of air fresheners.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this. I have only had this for 2 days so I will update my review if it stops working or something but as of now I LOVE this. Very easy to use and beautiful and the oil smells the room up! LOVE!</li>
    <li> So far it has been a great product. Hopefully it will hold up to daily use.</li>
    <li> This machine is only alright. The output is only good to fill a small room (8x8) and its better with a fan blowing the scent. Tried to fill a larger room 12x15 and it was not able to do that. You could barely smell the scent. Additionally there is an inconsistency with how long it takes for the auto shut off. Some times it is 4 hours but most of the time it&#x27;s a couple hours. Not familiar with other machines but this will do for now. Good luck shopping!</li>
