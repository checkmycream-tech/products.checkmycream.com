<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is so much better than my $60 rack. Its sturdy and takes up almost no space.</li>
    <li> While the item is what I wanted, it arrived broken in one place and cracked in another.  It would still function as intended but I did not pay to get something that is broken.  I will be looking in to returning this item.</li>
    <li> She loved it held many nail polishes and sturdy construction. Can also hang on the wall if you wanted to</li>
    <li> fiance loved  this item. She has so many nail polishes and now she can display them instead of leaving them in baskets or making holes on the wall.</li>
    <li> It actually holds 65 bottles. My daughter loved it for holding  her nail polishes. Now I have to get a 2nd one.</li>
    <li> These came quickly, we&#x27;re SO easy to put up, and hold all of my nail polishes! I actually bought more nail polish to fill them up</li>
    <li> We had so many bottles of polish here at home just thrown together in a basket. It was always a chore trying to locate a color. With this rack we can now see all the colors we have organized. It makes it much easier to select just the colors we are looking for.</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for the SO to keep her battlestation organized. Easy to assemble and has a ton of space. It was a lot larger than I had expected, guess I don&#x27;t know how big a nail polish bottle is.</li>
    <li> It works great! It was easy to assemble. I was excited to see all my OPI polish fit in the shelves without a problem.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken and damaged. I was left completely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Build well, sturdy. I am actually using it to hold my essential oils from Young Living. You can read each label and it doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of room.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for holding paint bottles. The quality was a little better than i had expected from some reviews. A fairly thick poly product that went together easily. I use mostly dropper bottle paints (Reaper, Vallejo, Army Painter, etc) and this makes it easier to organize and see the different bottles. I was happy enough with it that i ordered a second unit for the rest of the paint.</li>
    <li> not happy and missing the screws!! and cracked my daughter would like a new one and I feel they should just send out a new one on their dime!!!!!</li>
    <li> Where&#x27;s the screws???? No paperwork in box which I hate, seems like a easy assembly however no screws to put it together! What the heck</li>
    <li> Great rack, was delivered chipped so had it returned.</li>
    <li> Item missing. Returned item.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for my craft paints.  Works great!  I don&#x27;t have 60 bottles on the rack yet, but it will accommodate 60 craft paint bottles. (I have  3 rows all filled up).</li>
    <li> The rack is great but you need to use padding for the packaging. I received the rack broken :( such a disappointment!</li>
    <li> very helpful to organize your nail polish</li>
    <li> This slim polish stand doesn&#x27;t take up much room, yet holds 60 bottles of polish.  And each bottle is easy to see.</li>
    <li> Fantastic table rack, when I received it I was pleasantly surprised, it looks much much nicer than the photo shows, I simply love.  I have lots of friends wanting to know where I got it!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Awesome product, great price! Fast delivery. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I bought this nail polish rack as a way to organize my hobby paints. Works fine for either purpose, and is plenty sturdy enough to hold all of my paint bottles.</li>
    <li> This is probably intended for stores and salons, but when you have a lot of nail polish, it works just fine for your house.  This is an inexpensive way to find colors quickly.</li>
    <li> Using this rack for painting supplies (bottles of alcohol inks). They fit perfectly - a great price for such a nice organization tool!</li>
    <li> the product itself is okay, except that there are few cracks here and there, and the holes on the sides were completely off so I had to drill it myself again:)</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 and one was cracked rally bad when I recoeved it</li>
    <li> Three of the four holes for the screw to go through were not pushed through. I was able to push through two but the third one will need drilled or something. Disappointed. Contacted the company but have not heard back yet</li>
    <li> Great storage, however I wish the width of the levels was given..Does not fit the Nicole by OPI bottles..the shelves are very narrow...Most of my polish bottles fit, but it is quite a tight fit...Will find something else for my other nail polishes.</li>
    <li> The item was chipped off on two corners</li>
    <li> VERY Disappointed. Damaged !</li>
    <li> One was great but the other one was broken...</li>
    <li> It came pretty quickly and was bigger than I expected. Very easy to put together with absolutely no screws whatsoever. Extremely pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This table rack looks exactly like the product photo and does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I keep it on my dresser to organize my OPI brand nail polish. It was easy to assemble and high quality.</li>
    <li> Great rack holds a bit more then 60 polishes, worth the buy</li>
    <li> This rack is just what I needed. I did not realize how many bottles of nail polish I had until I purchased this. Fast shipping and very helpful.</li>
    <li> I attempted to purchase two racks. 1 out of 4 came to me broken. I finally gave up and kept the last one despite the fact that it is cracked and broken. I just got tired of dealing with it. The functionality is very good, but they still should have come to me in good condition.</li>
    <li> Perfect! It was easy as pie to set up and it holds all my nail polish.</li>
    <li> I use this for my essentisl oils. Everything is in it&#x27;s place and I can see all of them. Keeps them very organized.</li>
    <li> Product served it&#x27;s purpose.  Just wished it was better packed for shipping purposes.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for the 40 or so bottles of polish I have plus the assortment of files, and polish remover.  It does indeed hold 60.  Also, the little boxes of other nail goodies fit on it as well.  There is enough space that you don&#x27;t knock over the other bottles when picking one up.  putting it together was easy!  And it does not take up much space. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish rack. It was easy to put together and displays my extensive and ever-growing collection of nail polishes. I never realized how many polishes I had until I put them on this. I will likely order another one for the rest of my polishes.</li>
    <li> Got the tracking orders mixed up so when I thought it should have arrived it hadn&#x27;t, but that wasn&#x27;t a huge deal. Good quality and nice packaging. Much bigger than it looks in the picture. The one thing that bugs me is that the holes don&#x27;t line up perfectly with the sides, so I hope it wont be a problem when putting it together.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these. Great storage, really sturdy and very easy to assemble. I would definitely recommend this to store your polishes</li>
    <li> I order two to put all my polish in it;</li>
    <li> I used this inside my drawer for my eye shadows and blushes!  Works fabulous! Can also be used for nail polish.</li>
    <li> gorgeous, totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> Had one small broken piece but it was on the bottom and does not show so wasn&#x27;t concerned about it.  Holds my essential oils just like I wanted it to and is the right size.</li>
    <li> I have bought this before and love it. This time it had some broken pieces on it. I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of packing it up and having to drive 10 miles to take it to a ups place. They gave me some dollars off. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to return it. I use these to put my young living essential oils. It fits both size bottles.</li>
    <li> I was extremely impressed by this nail polish rack. The product came packaged beautifully. It had no nicks or scratches what so ever, and was super easy to put together. You do not need a man for this product, not even a tool but your fingers! I screwed in the side screws using my fingers and it held over 70 Deborah Lippmann and OPI nail polishes just fine :) I included a photo, so you can get a better idea! You will not be disappointed, I promise you!</li>
    <li> The product is very easy to assemble and suits my purpose perfectly!!!!!</li>
    <li> It makes my dresser look like the nail shop. Only drawback is it is a little difficult to get both sides to line up evenly.</li>
    <li> Sturdy nail polish rack. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their polishes neat and organized. Very easy to set up, no tools needed.</li>
    <li> This nail polish display rack came in handy! It fits my nail polish perfectly. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stand. Very nice and holds many shapes sizes nail polish. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Simple setup, holds many polishes, and looks great!</li>
    <li> corner piece broken but I still kept it.</li>
    <li> This works great to organize my DoTerra essential oils collection!</li>
    <li> Thirteen year old has all her polishes on display, very pretty and neat.  Perfect way to store and have quick access.</li>
    <li> These display racks were terrible!  I got two sets for my daughter and we put them together.  The ends (triangles) did not match.  The whole rack was off-balance by an inch/inch and half on both.  Amazon was terrific and took back the product right away and gave us a refund (THANK YOU AMAZON!)  Don&#x27;t waste your time though messing with this terrible product!!</li>
    <li> This product has been useful to organize the place of prodcutos beauty of my wife, deifinitivamente I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy and great value . A must have for every teenage girls room to organise all there nail polishes !!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! Displays all my polishes perfectly, never had an issue with it, great buy!</li>
    <li> Sitting on my dresser! It arrived quickly, with all pieces intact, and was super easy to assemble. It took me longer to arrange my polishes by color and put them all on the shelf than it did to actually put the shelf together. I also managed to fit closer to 80 polishes on it than the sixty it is reported to contain, though that is probably because many of my polishes are irregularly shaped. I love seeing all my polishes in one place at a glance, and would by another if I had a larger dresser! All in all, money well spent.</li>
    <li> This nail polish table rack was exactly what I needed! Came quickly and was packaged well. There are 3 parts and 4 screws, quite possibly the easiest assembly I&#x27;ve experienced in awhile! Maybe took 5 minutes to put together. Looks great, just like the picture. Love that I can see what polish I have now! It isn&#x27;t full yet, but would easily fit 60 bottles! Love it!</li>
    <li> I now have 2 of these for my home collection of nail polish.  I use this for my OPI bottles and my Gelish bottles.  I like to organize my polish by color.  These are nice.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish rack.  It fits all my nailpolish - OPI, Essie, Orly, China Glaze.  The only one that doesn&#x27;t fit is Nicole by OPI - you have to turn it to the side.  The rack is durable and easy to put together - no tools required.  Just beware, I bought this and only had about 20 nail polishes, now it is filling up fast!  I do my nails every week and it is so nice to be able to look at the rack and decide what colors to use, instead of going through a drawer.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my college daughter for Christmas. She loved it, though she did wish for some instructions to come with. However, she figured it out and loves the display.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect! It was easy to assemble and is very sturdy! The shipping took less time than I expected that was a plus. Overall it is a great product!</li>
    <li> well i got the nail polish rack, but it took about a week of searching and wondering with the post office of its whereabouts.  apparently, the postage was short $1.15, so that sucked.  otherwise, the product itself is exactly what you get.  just need a screwdriver to assemble it all together.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and well packaged so that all the pieces arrive without damage through the mail. Also well priced and sturdy. Overall I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase- it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I received a smaller rack than what I ordered, the one I got holds about 50 averaged sized bottles instead of 60 as advertised. It does the job though.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the doctor ordered. Sturdy, acrylic.  It sits on my printer as a nice display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is the Styrofoam it comes packaged in is hell to keep from clinging to the acrylic.  You literally have to chase it around and off the shelf until it&#x27;s all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you keep any Nicole by OPI polishes, they don&#x27;t fit.  Standard sized bottles do fit very well, however. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this not for nail polish but to hold my model paint. Each row is a little smaller than 1 and 1/2 inches deep. It perfectly holds Testors model master paints or the smaller 10 ml Tamiya jars. If you load it up it will hold 36 Model master or 30 Tamiya. anything smaller will fit. Alclad, humbrol tinlets, and  valejo will all work, Floquil railroad colors do not as they are just slightly to large. I like is so much I bought 3 more to hold most of my paints.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife for Christmas. Shipping took a little long, but not too bad. Ordered two, but one was missing the screws to assemble. That didn&#x27;t bother me as I went to Lowes to get some screws and nuts, simple enough. Wife loves the racks. Good quality, missing a set of hardware, but not a big deal to me.</li>
    <li> Nice product and service</li>
    <li> When I got this I loved it so much that I am ordering another!  Great service and item!  I was able to display all of my polishes and it looked so organized.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but wanted to give others a heads up about this product.  First, the rack I received works great.  However, just note that the one the vendor sends is NOT actually the one listed.  The one they send is actually the 6-row item.  Was concerned at first.  However, that item technically costs more, so better off ordering this item knowing you&#x27;re getting the more expensive one.  Also, no instructions included.  Once I figured out how it was supposed to be put together, it was fine.  I actually think it holds a little more than this one as well.  Worked for all my bottles, including OPI, Essie, Butter, etc.  Take a look at http://www.amazon.com/Nail-Polish-Table-Display-Bottles/dp/B0052FZ3CI/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1RAMR366E5Q78EF46P4J  to see what you will get.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was hoping for! Easy to put together. Fits all the bottles that I have and still room for more!</li>
    <li> Received it broken. Had to return.</li>
    <li> Nice piece for keeping your polish in a nice display!  A bit pricey for plastic but it does the job.</li>
    <li> This product was easy to assemble and does a great job of displaying your polishes. It makes the task of picking a nail polish much easier. The only downside is that it does take a lot of room, but if you&#x27;re like me, and don&#x27;t want to drill holes in the wall to hold a nail polish rack, then this is a great alternative!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Great for storing all of my nail polishes, and fits perfectly on my shelf! Took a lot longer than expected to actually ship out to me, but it was worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Worked and fit all types of nail polishes. Convenient, easy to build and comes as explained. Would recommend this product for people who want to organize</li>
    <li> I really like this stand.  Fits all different sizes and shapes of nail polish bottles, including major brands like OPI.  It takes up kind of a lot of room, but it&#x27;s so nice to be able to easily see all of my nail polishes instead of having to dig around in a box.</li>
    <li> I love my nail polish rack. I definately get the benifits of the rack instead of having my polish all in a box. I wish I would had bought the one that holds more polish. Otherwise this is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish rack. So easy to assemble, and I had my nail polishes organized and displayed in no time. Might have to get another and will definitely purchase from Beauticom again. Items were shipped on Monday and were to me on Wednesday. Thank you, Beauticom!</li>
    <li> I use these racks (I now have 4 of them) to hold the small bottles of acrylic paints that I use for painting miniatures for table top wargaming.  For those interested, they hold 13 bottles of Citadel paints per shelf, and you can get 14 bottles of P3, &amp;#34;Minitaire&amp;#34;, or Vallejo paints per shelf. These racks work great for storing my paints while keeping them organized and within easy reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice and easy to assemble.  Word of warning though, they are clear acrylic/plastic so do not tighten the screws too tight during assembly or it will crack the plastic at the join.  Nothing terrible, just some &amp;#34;spider webbing&amp;#34; at the screw hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product that has kept my life a little more sane.</li>
    <li> I bought this to organize my bottles of model paint. It handles all sizes and shapes and with the tiered design, I can see all my paints at a glance. This makes finding the color I want a breeze. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Works great for YLEO collection.  Holds a lot of bottles and looks good on my dresser!</li>
    <li> I had about 40 bottles of nail polish I needed to organize. This holder had more than enough room. I like being able to see all of the colors, too.</li>
    <li> use to display/store our essential oils.</li>
    <li> Cute product but arrived cracked, it needs to be wrapped better for shipping</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly on my shelf. Super sturdy and so easy to assemble. Such a lovely way to store your favourite nail polishes.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this for about month.  It was very easy to put together, just a couple of screws.  Not too bad a footprint size, and with it being clear it&#x27;s not very intrusive of a design.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife who has like 100 bottles of nail polish strewn about the house. Extremely easy to put together, looks nice, and organized some of my wife&#x27;s polishes. It actually held a couple more than 60 bottles, but some of those were skinny, so I guess it typically holds 60 bottles +/- depending on bottle size. But yeah, nice rack and I&#x27;ll probably order one or two more soon...</li>
    <li> So this came in a small box in a bigger Amazon box, but there were no packaging foam or anything between the two boxes so it&#x27;s no wonder that the item came broken. There&#x27;re parts of the clear plastic that&#x27;s cracked. Other than the two big triangle pieces that&#x27;s screwed in, all the other parts are glued and mine had parts that had come unglued and fallen out. Overall, the material looks cheap and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;ll actually hold all the weight of the nail polishes I have, so I will be returning this.</li>
    <li> Im really happy with my purchase, it came as I expected , it need it a little of assemble but it was not that hard to put it together.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this! It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and I&#x27;ll probably purchase another one for my sister because she loves mine. It&#x27;s really sturdy and super easy to put together. You don&#x27;t need any tools, either. I&#x27;m so happy with this and it arrived in just a few days. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this item, looks just like the ones at the nail salon.</li>
    <li> Durable material! It looks so cute without being too big and we actually got 65 bottles to fit! Will definitely be buying more and is perfect for storing the nail polish!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately my nail polish rack came cracked &amp; had broken pieces. It is still functionally and I have the bad side up against the wall. But beware that the plastic is thin and can be easily damaged during shipping. Otherwise I like the product &amp; serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> At first i couldnt figure out what went where, but im horrible at that kind of stuff to begin with. Once i figured it out it took me a few minutes to put the screws in and i was done. Pretty sturdy, holds my essie, orly, gelish, and revlon perfectly. Had to turn my nicole to the side but thats ok. I did get the 5 shelf that was advertised as well.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble, even holds more than 60 nail polishes (if you use smaller drug store bottles such as Milani and arrange them sideways). Glad I purchased this stand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing, easy assembly.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Needed a place to display my abundance of nail polishes (mostly Essie) so that I could easily see all the colors. Was previously storing them in a large shoebox. This is perfect. Good strong quality and fits the nail polishes beautifully so that all the colors are visible. It also fits most other nail polishes too, not just Essie.</li>
    <li> This is great, literally, I didn&#x27;t realize it was so big. But is very good to have an organized nail polish shelve.</li>
    <li> So easy to put together and now I have my nail polish organized and I can see all the colors better now. I already filled this one full so I need to buy another one, this is great for anyone with a lot of nail polish. You should defiantly buy it it was the best 20 dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, all of my polish fits in there nicely, the cost was appropriate and it arrived quickly</li>
    <li> This was bigger than I thought it would be. Plus a huge chunk was broken out of it and it was cracked in many places. Returned immediately.</li>
    <li> Rack was larger than I thought.  Even with the dimensions provided.  It would have been ideal to have a wall attachment possibility included.</li>
    <li> Very easy to put together and looks very nice! Great for the unorganized soul, Makes your space more presentable. Lightweight so it won&#x27;t get too heavy, lots of space to show off your colors.</li>
    <li> Really nice and held a lot of polish</li>
    <li> Very nice table rack display; clean and neat. I would buy this again in the future. Price was good too.</li>
    <li> Like the headline says it&#x27;s not super high quality but it is decent, does what it needs to do, and doesn&#x27;t look to bad. Mine gave with a piece of plastic broken off but it was in a place that you don&#x27;t see so it wasn&#x27;t worth returning. Also you have to put it together but it doesn&#x27;t come with directions all though it&#x27;s easy to figure out. I have several different brands of nail polish including OPI, Nicole by OPI, and Essie and they all fit.  For me it was worth getting.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to put together&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick&lt;br /&gt;fits most nail polish bottles (except) Nicole by OPI they have to go sideways&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It arrived cracked in one place</li>
    <li> This rack arrived today in over protected shipping status  , Wrapped in a protective package  , Bubble wrap underneath , In composite container with foam wrap protective of the contents.... Awesome shipping !! Upon removing the display from the container 2 of the shelving fronts fell off  , The rack is cracked , with no visible damage to the shipping container ! There was no hardware shipped to assemble the rack to a functioning status.. Total production failure !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m THIRLLED w/this item. It arrived quickly and was SUPER easy to assemble.  My nailpolishes are finally organized so well.  The price was very affordable in comparison w/other similar nail organizers. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Nail polish table rack Is poorly made .two days later it all came unglue and fell apart.had to trash it.poor investment</li>
    <li> I have a whole lot of nail polish that is now all neat and orderly thanks to this thing! Exactly what I expected :)</li>
    <li> The stand looks professional and was very easy to put together. It sits nicely on a table or shelf, but you can&#x27;t hang it up on a wall.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time! And it was very easy to assemble. You just need a screwdriver. It holds my Sinful Colors nail polish!</li>
    <li> Put together in mere minutes and exactly as expected..Would recommend.  Excellent plricing.  Review requires too many words and it is just not that complicated</li>
    <li> I love this all my nail polish look great, it&#x27;s big, but I do have a lot of polishes, and most importantly is sturdy.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product!  It was a sinch to put together which is great because I hate assembly.. and it makes all your polishes seem so much more organized and you can actually view and find colors way easier.. was going to get a rotating rack but I&#x27;m glad I went with this instead because the price is so much cheaper! Holds all my brands of nail polishes.</li>
    <li> The plastic was a little cracked upon delivery but it was not anything beyond comsmetic so I let it go. Makes organizing really easy.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my collection look super organized and pretty! I would recommend this product to everyone especially if you have a nail polish fetish.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, easy to assemble. It was a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it, she could fit all her nail polish bottles in it.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  The only issue I have is that it it does take up some space...but it&#x27;s still great!</li>
    <li> Met &amp; exceeded expectations!</li>
    <li> super easy to put together. love the display. looks great and really fits a lot of my nail polish.</li>
    <li> Very simple construction and seems to hold all sizes of my wife&#x27;s polishes.  She loves it and you will too.</li>
    <li> This rack is really good for the price and my girlfriend loves it. Something nice and cheap and now there is no mess in my room.lol</li>
    <li> We are overrun with bottles of e-liquid, so I picked up this rack. It holds a ton of bottles and was a great purchase for this purpose. Very easy to assemble (just 4 screws). I was able to fit about 75 bottles of varying sizes on it.</li>
    <li> This product has totally organized my nail polishes. I can glance at them &amp; easily pick out the one I want without disturbing any others. Take it out, put it back. No moving, rummaging, knocking over, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Only con is that the plastic is a little thin, &amp; mine came with a missing piece on the side ? It also takes up some space, so need to have room for it.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do and looks sleek and elegant.  I may need another one because apparently I have more than 60 nail polishes.  Also this rack fits most nail polish bottles, the only nail polish bottle it did&#x27;nt fit was a Nick K nail polish, but it was ok because I only have 1 nail polish from Nicka K.  If your&#x27;re looking for a nail polish rack to display all your nail polishes (60 bottles) I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Met all of my expectations. Easy assemble</li>
    <li> Fantastic display to show my husband, exactly where my allowance goes! This rack holds most nail polish brands well, and can squeeze in a few more of the smaller bottles. The price has increased since I purchased,  but I will still be ordering another!</li>
    <li> Easy assembly and a sturdy product.  If I happen to need them, I will definitely be buying more. :-)</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone!  I bought it to help organize my essential oils (which are very pricey.)  I wish I would have put it together in March when I ordered it because I would have definitely sent it back! Straight out of the box it fell apart.  The only part you have to assemble are the sides (which is handy) but the glue or whatever is holding the shelves in place, does not work at all.  When I pulled it out of the box, I had three pieces to work with. I set it down to grab a screw and nut and the lip fell off of each shelf! I could&#x27;ve found something better quality at the Dollar Tree!</li>
    <li> Great for viewing all your nail polish. Looked a little different from the picture. Easy to assemble. Looks more like the displays for nail salons. Might be too big for home use. Not all size bottles fit.</li>
    <li> It came early and was exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> Good simple solution.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately one of the side pieces arrived broken, luckily I was putting it in a corner so it&#x27;s holding up okay.</li>
    <li> Thanks Is very fast and good comunicatio. AAA++++</li>
    <li> I was looking for a great way to store and organize my ink mist, embossing powder, and glitter. This little guy was wonderful for doing just that. I haven&#x27;t received my shelves for my room yet but these two racks are going to be placed on one shelf. thecraftypickle dot com is where you can see more photos of how I used these awesome racks :)</li>
    <li> I love this product!  All of my polishes fit and I can see whatI have!</li>
    <li> Fits all my opi products with ease. Looks so nice, and all colors are easily accessible. Definitely get this if you cannot do a wall mounted one.</li>
    <li> Received this product and it was damaged - two pieces of the plastic were broken where you insert the screws to hold the rack together.  This is a great product overall and holds a lot of polishes. Sad that it came broken but was able to glue together so I did not have to return and pay postage again.</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail today and realized 2 pieces were missing from it and I found them at the bottom of the box. I hate having to send stuff back because it&#x27;s such a hassle that I was able to make it work simply by super gluing the top so the pieces would stay together. I should&#x27;ve read other reviews about it being cracked or chipped or pieces broken off of it before buying. Save your money this thing is super cheap and obviously breaks easily. Not worth the $17 if you ask me. Buy a cute spice rack, hang it on your wall and display your nail polishes that way.</li>
    <li> Works well, sturdy.  Makes it a lot easier to see the colors you have.  I have three girls and they are at the age where they want to do nails quite a bunch.  We end up having nail polish in everyone&#x27;s rooms with no organization.  Easy to assemble</li>
    <li> I loved this nail Polish rack! Great quality. Very beautiful . Fast shipping . I don&#x27;t have too much nail polish so on the 2 bottom rows I out some everyday makeup. I love this rack sooo much . Definitely recommend for sure!</li>
    <li> Easy to put together. I have different shape polishes and I have more than 60 bottles on it.  This table rack has really help organize my space without taking up lots of space to do so.</li>
    <li> Love it very good quality  :) Beautiful on my makeup table, very modern style, fast shipping! I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very thin &amp; flimsy, was broken already when I opened box.</li>
    <li> My rack looks exactly like on the picture. The rack is sturdy, well-made and it fits OPI nail polishes. Proper screws were attached. I am very happy. I bought my rack from \\&quot;Hunnt\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Holds all my polishes nicely</li>
    <li> Easy to put together, holds the nail polish perfectly.</li>
    <li> It is holding all of my bottles of polish and it looks very nice and neat. It was easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> Really nice display rack for my essential oils. I wish it had a taller rail on the front so tall, slender roller bottles didn&#x27;t fall out easily. I hope someday they make one adjustable width wise, for more placement options.</li>
    <li> This tray holds many bottles of nail polish but not securely.  The bottles tip easily if the tray is bumped.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering more of these and this is a great product. And will tell my friends as well</li>
    <li> Holds 1oz  inks perfectly, nothing bigger(I put larger bottles into 1oz for easy use, access). Organized my ink Great!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted.  Easy to put together, easy to clean.  This is a great product for the money.</li>
    <li> Love it! No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for when looking for something to hold and display all of my nail polish! I&#x27;m afraid I will have to get ANOTHER one because my collection is just becoming HUGE!</li>
    <li> Great nail polish rack, the quality is as expected, some other acrylic displays are less durable.</li>
    <li> This is attractive and was very simple to assemble. Nice quality acrylic, and sturdy. I might get another one, actually.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem totally sturdy and parts of the rack were chipped/broken off by the time I got it in the mail.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this to hold fingernail polish. I bought it to organize my color gels, temporary hair color bottles, etc. Worked great keeping all those little bottles organized.</li>
    <li> First one came broken and they replaced it with extremely fast mailing.  LOVE IT and recommend it to all my oilers:)  Great Essentail Oil holder.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it came broken and severally cracked in several places. I asked for a replacement which they sent and it was also broken and cracked in several places. The product is not packaged properly which after the first one they said they would make sure it was packaged better......it was not!  I asked for a refund which they would not give unless I sent both racks back at MY expense, which is not worth it. Don&#x27;t buy this nail polish rack.</li>
    <li> I really like the way these look on my counter. While I had issues with assembly, once I had it assembled I totally thought it was worth the hassle!</li>
    <li> How embarrassing ! I purchased this a bday present. The pieces fit well enough that the stand will work and was truly fine once assembled. The downer is that one of the three washers that was included was the incorrect so the bday girl had to go purchase the correct washer at our local hardware store</li>
    <li> great organizer for all my bottles of polish</li>
    <li> My 15 year old daughter asked for it and she loves it, good pricing</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I ordered, as described in their description. OPI nail polish fits perfectly well in the rack. Great product. Here are a few photos: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7idqwjw1alwq5fz/DSC_0122.JPG?dl&#x3D;0 ,  https://www.dropbox.com/s/6h1lg919g26bbfq/DSC_0123.JPG?dl&#x3D;0 , https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ose17yqvk1tnad/DSC_0127.JPG?dl&#x3D;0 , https://www.dropbox.com/s/qqsly0f9avkpg79/DSC_0129.JPG?dl&#x3D;0</li>
    <li> So Excited to finally organize my nice polishes.  I&#x27;m a Ulta junkie and have more than 1000 nail polish colors.  I&#x27;ll just change colors out per season and keep the others in my clear tub organizer until I need them.  Nice clean looking counter thanks to this display.</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack meets my needs. It holds all my nail polish and it fits perfect on my vanity. It also holds most size and brands of nail polishes. The only thing is, I wish the front that keeps the polish in place were a little higher so the nail polish does not keep falling forward. It&#x27;s fine as long as I don&#x27;t carry it around like I did when I moved it from my bedroom to my living room. If you keep it in one place you won&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
    <li> Keeps your polish organized….every lady should own one!!</li>
    <li> I am a huge nail polish junky, so this product was great for me. Easy to construct and it holds all 58 bottles of my nail polish. It sits comfortably on my dresser without throwing off the decor. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this. The one I got looks exactly like the one pictured. I ordered from the seller &amp;#34;eachdesk&amp;#34; It does hold my China Glaze perfectly, however it will hold 11 bottles per row for a total of 55. Smaller bottles from other brands may make the 60 it claims to hold. Just the same I love it and am ordering a second one.</li>
    <li> I am a miniature painter and have well over 200 paints in my collection.  They range from the Games Workshop paint pots to Vallejo dropper bottles.  I purchased two of these racks and have fit my paints into them.  They are now organized neatly, easy to get to, and I can see the color in the bottle so I dont have to hunt for what I am looking for.  They are sturdy, easy to assemble.  I highly recommend these for anyone with a painting station.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic purchase.  It sets up easily and is very sturdy.  I would have liked to see it offered is a few different colors, but I do like the clear.</li>
    <li> My mom got me this for Christmas, it was the first thing I went right after! It was very easy to assemble (took me 5-10 minutes) and it holds all my nail polish. I recommend this for any nail polish lovers :)</li>
    <li> i love the quality of this table rack, due to some of the size of my nail polish bottle I was able to store up to 71 bottles. It is a very good organizer it help me to keep all my bottles in one place.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and was well price, however once I opened the package it was broken. Not broken enough for me to be unable to use it (and because I needed it ASAP I could not afford to lose time returning it and waiting for a new one). I wish that the company would package it better for next time and list it as fragile or something because I had to super glue it. I am not fully satisfied, but whatever</li>
    <li> one corner of one of the legs was broken off, but since the piece was in the packaging, i was able to glue it back on.  the holder works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Great product, but the four screws did not come with it.</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack is exactly what i had in mind, quick easy set up and displays up to 60 bottles efficiently!</li>
    <li> This is a joke!! No instructions,holes on shelves don&#x27;t match up with side pieces.  Ridiculous. Spend a little more &amp; get yourself a quality product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to organize all of our nail polishes. Believe it or not I still have nail polish&#x27;s left and this thing holds a bunch! It&#x27;s kind of nice to go pick out your nail polish feels like you were at the salon at home. We have everything organized by brand.</li>
    <li> Amazing it looks like I have a salon in my bathroom . All my friends think its soo cool</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchased this item.  The first time a piece if the acrylic was broken off but I kept it anyway. This time it didn&#x27;t come with any screws or washers to hold it together.  Again, didn&#x27;t want to go through all the trouble of sending back so I used screws I had and a glue gun. Bottom line, I don&#x27;t know why there are so many issues.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Had a piece broken off but not a big deal.  Wasn&#x27;t in a place that made a difference.  I didn&#x27;t tell the seller about it because it really didn&#x27;t make a problem for me.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> OK I see that several people who ordered this got what they expected.  Not so here.  I got the main tray, but the side pieces were - are you ready for this? - press board with holes drilled in them.  They aren&#x27;t the same size and the holes on one of them don&#x27;t line up!  What??  And no screws were included to get them on even if the holes did line up!  I am not using this as a display, and my husband is an engineer so we will figure out a way to make it work.  Maybe.  Maybe I will send this piece of junk back.  That is to be determined.    **Update  So my engineer husband got home and checked it out.  The stand legs are not in fact press board.  They are covered with brown paper.  However, one still does not match so he will drill new holes and there still were no screws.</li>
    <li> Recently, I found myself with an over abundance of nail polish ,but no place to display or organize it. So I searched Amazon for and found this item which looked like the perfect solution. Price was good, it would hold lots of polishes and the multi level display seemed visually appealing.&lt;br /&gt; I was  looking forward to getting this, but when I opened it, I was so disappointed. Rattling around the packing container were several loose shards of plastic that had broken off from middle of rack where the bottles are supposed to sit. Three of the rack&#x27;s five levels had cresent shaped chunks missing from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put everything back in the box and began the process of returning the item. Turns out this item was not eligible for return. This was not something that I saw written anywhere when I purchased it. Obviously, some items are non returnable, like foodstuffs, cosmetics...but a broken nail polish display? Ridiculous! I was hot under the proverbial collar.&lt;br /&gt;Although this was from a third party seller, since I ordered from Amazon, it was Amazon whom I complained to. And now comes the only good part of this ordeal. I thought I&#x27;d get a form email telling me they were sorry, but there was nothing they could do to help. But instead, the rep said he would refund the entire price and that I didn&#x27;t even have to return the item. I could keep it, throw it out or do whatever i wanted with it. Also, for my trouble, he offered me free one day shipping on my next order which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, since I had the item, I figured it was a waste to throw it out. Even though it was pretty badly broken, I decided to try and fix what I could. So I found some super glue and managed to glue most of the broken pieces back in and the areas that I could fix, I set my nail polish against so that the &amp;#34;wounds&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t show. So, I am able to use it now and it actually doesn&#x27;t look too bad, which is why I gave it three stars. If I hadnt been able to fix it up, it, it would have gotten one star. However, the shame of it is, if it hadn&#x27;t come broken, it would have been a fantastic item and I would have given it four or even five stars.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken and cracked.</li>
    <li> Item arrived BROKEN and cut my hand. I don&#x27;t even understand how such hard plastic could break but it did and picking the pieces out of the box cut my hand. I posted pictures on packing feedback. I deserve a refund or to be send a new one!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Came well wrapped to avoid damage. Very good quality!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble. Works better than the huge storage container that I was using before! I plan to purchase another one. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Love the item. Now i need to buy more nails polishs.</li>
    <li> I just received mine today and I gotta say, at first I was worried that it would come either scratched up, broken or missing parts. Luckily it was all in tacked, everything was there and it looks amazing, I get why they didn&#x27;t send instructions, it&#x27;s better to just look at the picture online to get how it goes together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I know people have complained about was the packaging, mine came in packed good and tight. While it didn&#x27;t have instructions (as I said above) it was packaged rather well, on the box it says \\&quot;glass, handle with care\\&quot; it&#x27;s plastic NOT glass, but I&#x27;m glad they put that there to help prevent  damage to the product. I&#x27;d give this 5 stars over all.</li>
    <li> I bought this rack for my airbrush paints, it does the job. HOWEVER, they need to serious work on the item not breaking in transit. A rather large piece was broken off on the back part of the &#x27;steps&#x27;. Not a big deal since it doesn&#x27;t hurt the function of the stand, however for what I paid for it, I would expect my items to be intact on delivery.</li>
    <li> This was very easy to put together which is a must for me!  It works great and holds all of my nail polish.  I love the look of this holder as well!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift for my mom. It came with a piece broken off and a big crack where it looks like another piece will break off soon. I disclosed this info to my mom before giving it to her and she was fine with it as it wasn&#x27;t something that would keep it from functioning structurally and it&#x27;s not going to be on display. So 3 stars because it came broken but my mom was still happy.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Sturdy plastic. Ledges are perfect size for just about any brand. Displays well.</li>
    <li> Returned.  Thought the bottles were held in better. Also, came without any screws. Not as sturdy as I wanted.</li>
    <li> 4 screws you have to assemble and wha~la this is the best little rack I have ever purchased.  Definately worth the money.  Very Sturdy, I love the clear acrylic look  holds plenty of polish and makeup.</li>
    <li> bigger than I thought it would be.  holds a BUNCH of polishes</li>
    <li> Ordered this exact item on this page \\&quot;MODEL PR60\\&quot; acrylic Holds 60 bottles including OPI, ESSIE, CHINA GLAZE. I ordered this one because it had a&lt;br /&gt;measurement of 16\\&quot; x 11\\&quot; x 2\\&quot; (unassembled size) with 5 Rows....  THE LEDGE shelf IS 2&#x27;&#x27; WIDE AND WILL HOLD THE OPI NAIL POLISH..This IS WHY I ORDERD THIS ONE!! They SENT ME MODEL \\&quot;NPS-60\\&quot; IT HAS 6 ROWS AND MEASUREMENT OF 14\\&quot; Length x 9.25\\&quot; Width x 8\\&quot; Height Nail Polish Table Rack Display  THIS ONE IS ONLY 1.5&#x27;&#x27; WIDE NOT 2\\&quot; like the one I orered. It will not hold the OPI size nail polish bottles... Contacted them to let them know they sent the wrong stand (and there is a price difference), they would not write back till amazon contacted them, this is their direct quote..&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Yes, we are aware of which item you ordered, and the rack you received is the rack we ship to all of our customers that purchase the item.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;They have several of these racks on several pages with different prices, please be aware of what they may send.</li>
    <li> Easy Assembly and displays nail polish bottles beautifully. I have a large variety of polish brands and they all fit fine except Nicole by OPI bottles need to be put in either sideways or at a tilted angle.</li>
    <li> The screws were missing and the side pieces werent matching. I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> pleased with item thank you</li>
    <li> If you are growing girls that paint nails, get this. You will be able to keep all polishes in one place. You parents with similar experience know what I&#x27;m talking about. Holds plenty in one spot.</li>
    <li> I hate this stupid thing! The one of the holes for the screws were closed! Never buy this!!!!!!!  Would give it 0 stars but would not let me!!!!!!</li>
    <li> When I received mine is was broken on the side piece, but I am lazy so I just glued it and it works fine.</li>
    <li> pieces were broken off, but it is still usable</li>
    <li> item as described and fast shipping</li>
    <li> As a prior nail tech for over 20 years, I have so very many bottles filling up many bins, &amp; strewn about my home, in every room. It got old quick, when looking for a specific color. I used to have these on my desk @ work. Of course spotted it here @ my beloved Amazon, &amp; purchased several. Easy to put together! Sturdy enough. Reasonable price. Now it&#x27;s organized, colors are easy to find. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. Very organized. it keeps all my nail polish together. Very simple set up and light. Product is as described!</li>
    <li> Love it! Best way to display my nail polish collection.</li>
    <li> Love it hold a lot of nail polish looks need and great,. Will recommend if you want your nail polish organized</li>
    <li> Perfect just what we ordered.  Great shipping time, and good price for product.</li>
    <li> The rack is cool, but it came with NO SCREWS, which isn&#x27;t in the description at all... sooo this is a completely useless product, since I can&#x27;t even assemble it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> this was easy for me to put together and fits nicely on my shelf.  Holds alot of polish really happy with it</li>
    <li> This is a great little rack. We used it at craft fairs to display 1/2 oz bottles of essential oil blends. It held up well and looked great. Now if only someone would make one of these racks that held bottles with a 2 1/2 inch diameter I&#x27;d buy a couple in an instant</li>
    <li> It is small enough to sit on my shelves, yet each row is wide enough for all kind of brands, even OPI bottles fit well on it. Super easy to put together, took two minutes or less.</li>
    <li> I will never ever again buy anything there is a 3rd party attached to it.  Horrible experience and taught me a lesson.</li>
    <li> Was easy to put together. Had a couple of cracks in it from the shipment but is holding up well</li>
    <li> Easy set-up + holds more than 60 nail polishes AND it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space. I&#x27;m so pleased with this purchase. I&#x27;ve been looking for this rack everywhere.</li>
    <li> Perfect for storing and organizing you polish. Easy to assemble. Great bang for your buck. Bought 2 as a gift, definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect display for my nail polish.</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL! I bought this to store my Young Living Essential Oils. It will hold 14 of the 15ml bottles or 18 of the 5ml bottles in each row. Very pleased with the quality. The rack was simple to put together as well. No tools needed.</li>
    <li> Depending on the size of your nail polish bottles, it may or may not hold 60 bottles.  This product reminds me of a display case one might see in a nail salon, but I don&#x27;t think I would trust hanging it on the wall (as I have seen displayed in some nail salons).  It is great to display your nail colors if you have the space to put this container.  Sturdy; durable.  It was shipped to me and suffered a small piece of plastic that was broken off, but once the legs were screwed on, the damage was negligible.  I like having all my nail polish displayed on this case so that I can find the exact color that I want without rummaging through my basket.</li>
    <li> I rec item damaged and cracked in several place great product but needs a better way of protecting package during shipment.</li>
    <li> Nice quality for something so cheap.  I put it together in 3 minutes and it holds all her nail polishes just fine, odd and weird shaped bottles fir great too.</li>
    <li> There are three large cracks on the stand. Not happy. Looks like it was already used and resold to myself.</li>
    <li> love this nail polish organizer.  holds lots of polishes and all different bottle sizes and types.  my daughter has it on her bedroom dresser and loves it.</li>
    <li> Got this for the girlfriend for Christmas and she likes it.  It&#x27;s light plastic so it&#x27;s not the most durable stand out there, ours got knocked over and the piece of plastic holding the screw snapped.  It&#x27;s currently super glued together :-/</li>
    <li> Came broken.. if not, it would have been a great purchase... as expected.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price.  I don&#x27;t use it for nail polish though.  I purchased it to store my Young Living oils on.  It fits perfectly in my glass cabinet and I can easily find the oil I need without having to hunt through a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like my oils are sitting right in the cabinet through the glass.  The acrylic is almost invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some commented that items slide off of it.  I do not seem to have this issue.  While there is no non-slip surface, the glass bottles really do seem to grip nicely and I do think moving it with items in it would work fine.</li>
    <li> Guys. I have a confession to make. I have a bit of a problem. &amp;#62;.&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pretty little acrylic racks are the PERFECT solution to displaying my problem and keeping my problem organized. Check it out! The racks hold a LOT of polish. The one on the right has 66 bottles. Granted, these bottles are of varying brands. I own polish bottles ranging in size from Funky Fingers to StudioM (StudioM bottles are exactly perfect to sit in these slots sideways which can maximize the amount of polishes these racks can hold) all of them fit perfectly! (Don&#x27;t mind the strays in the center. They&#x27;re doubles or ugly and are on their way out anyway. ;) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for ease-of-assembly: do you think you can match up 4 holes, insert a short screw, and then twist on the back? Because that is literally all the assembly there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the stadium style seating is clear acrylic. I&#x27;ve put a string of mini blue LEDs behind them for display purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I hadn&#x27;t purchased these sooner.</li>
    <li> This rack is perfect for storing nail polish. I have been garnering quite a collection, all different shape and size bottles. This rack holds all of them without any issue. It is made from sturdy plastic, so I am not worried about it falling apart. It was easy to assemble, I mean really, only four screws, so simple. When I run out of room I will order another one of these.</li>
    <li> It didnt come with screws!!!! Sorry for the late review. What am I going to do with it now?</li>
    <li> It surprised me that it was here so quickly.  It was perfect for my essentials oils.  Thank you so much, easy to assemble as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday it was nice but came in mail broken so had to return.</li>
    <li> Edge of the side penal was broken...</li>
    <li> Great for a teen, my niece loved it, it is a cute way to store nail polish.</li>
    <li> Packaged perfectly, not one scratch on it.  It went together quickly and works perfectly for my assorted oils.</li>
    <li> For my collection of essential oils this is PERFECT. I can see each label at a glance and find what I need. And no, it&#x27;s not made for traveling, it&#x27;s designed as a display shelf for small bottles. I looked at a lot of holders for essential oil bottles and they were so pricey I considered making my own. Then I thought about the bottles being close to nail polish size, and that&#x27;s how I ended up buying this rack. This holds the typical bottles that have a half ounce or even 1 ounce. It holds fourteen bottles across on each row. If you&#x27;re like me and accumulate a lot of essential oils and such, it&#x27;s just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This rack is great. Very large and the bottles fit perfectly. Would be too large for a counter top in my opinion. Looks nice and was easy to put together.</li>
    <li> Item arrived broken. So I returned back.</li>
    <li> My friend has so many nail polish bottles that I was only happy to contribute something to her collection that would help her organize them a little better.</li>
    <li> Love it. I  use it for essential oils and some other things.</li>
    <li> It makes my nail polish look so pretty!!</li>
    <li> This shelf is perfect for my bathroom. It fits just right on the counter and all of the different nail polish bottles fit just fine...even the odd shaped ones.!</li>
    <li> Came in fast, perfect for my nail polish collection. But I ran out of room now I have to buy a bigger rack or a new one lol.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy! Awesome Ty!</li>
    <li> This product arrived in a timely manner and with good packaging, however, this product arrives with four screws and four bolts in which the screws are placed. One of the screws that was sent to me had no grooves in it at all, meaning it was essentially just a nail. I went to a local hardware store and purchased new screws, determined to make this product work! After it was assembled, the display case completely leaned to one side! This product ships in three parts; the main display rack and two triangle shaped side pieces that the screws go into in order for this product to stand up. The two plastic side pieces that came with my rack werent the same size, and that is what caused my shelf to lean. I knew that I was purchasing cheap plastic shelves to begin with, but I didnt know that this product would essentially be garbage. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Easy to put together. Works great for what I bought it for (essential oils). But it arrived cracked, and doesn&#x27;t seem too sturdy. Overall, I like it for what it does and it still looks pretty good despite the crack on the side.</li>
    <li> I love mine it is very sturdy and looks great.</li>
    <li> Came together nicely. Impressed with the quality of the materials and the overall construction and appearance of the display rack.</li>
    <li> Arrived to my house broken where the screws were suppose to go. Some quick dry clear glue from Staples fixed it in a jiffy. Don&#x27;t want to deal with returning and replacing. Works like a charm not but wish the packing would have been better protected. Probably will not buy again from user.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a large selection of nail polishes and wanted to get organized, so we bought her this and it looks really nice now that things have a place to go.</li>
    <li> Front of display separates from bottom of tray.  It was broken upon arrival. I had to super glue the tray.</li>
    <li> As I said in the title, this shelf fulfills a lot of purposes: cute, easy to put together, and holds a lot of polish. Here are just some brands that can fit inside the shelves:&lt;br /&gt;-Zoya&lt;br /&gt;-OPI&lt;br /&gt;-Essie&lt;br /&gt;-Julep&lt;br /&gt;-butter London&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only one that can&#x27;t fit is Nicole by OPI, and you can either turn it sideways or sorta put it in at an angle and it stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have four of these shelves and I&#x27;ll probably buy more soon!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Simple to assemble.  Recommended for anyone with nail polish.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this to store all my nail polished! To my disappointment as soon as I opened the box &amp; got the rack out I noticed one of the shelves fell of , I wasn&#x27;t that worried since I saw screws but when I started to put it together I found out the screws where not for the shelves as a matter of fact the shelves are glued in! Yeah It could b fixed I have a hot glue gun but who wants to that when you payed for the item! Wish I could return it but no paper work came in the box!</li>
    <li> I received this for Christmas so when my granddaughter was here over New Year&#x27;s, we collected all my nail polishes throughout the house. I then had her divide them by color, she counted them out, had to make a goodie bag for her; then stacked them on the rack. She is four going on fourteen but this Nana had a great time with her. I love knowing what colors i have or which ones I need to buy.</li>
    <li> The plastic pieces were not cleanly cut along the edges. The holes were the screws were supposed to insert were not cut through all the way. Most of them I was able to pop out, but one in particular was not going to budge. I had to go at it with a drill, and luckily I did not break the plastic doing so. With that said, now that it&#x27;s assembled it functions and looks fine.</li>
    <li> i like my nail poilish holder and i got it for a good price , but the only thing i didnt like was the fact it was little crack when i got it but i still would recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Great item for its price.</li>
    <li> I love these! I ordered 8 and they are really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people in the reviews are saying that they received a different one than they ordered, but if you order from E-Discount you will get the exact item in the picture and they ship super fast. I literally had mine the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great for my shop!</li>
    <li> Sturdy, easy to assemble.  Just like in a salon and perfect for organizing and displaying your nail polishes.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried that it would arrive broken or with missing pieces like I read the reviews but it came complete &amp; in great condition.</li>
    <li> This holds a lot of nail polish, and came with the screws and bolts to put it together. The material cracks easy, so be careful with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed to keep my nail polishes organized.</li>
    <li> Great for hobby paints. Citadel, Reaper, and Vallejo Bottles fir perfectly.</li>
    <li> I am using this for my essential oils and it works fabulous!!</li>
    <li> Great sturdy stand, I bought this to actually use for my plastic model paints :P works great and I can grab and read the bottles with ease!</li>
    <li> This was great for organizing my bottles. Now I know where to find everything.</li>
    <li> Plenty of slots for your everyday color polishes. I also use it for my lipsticks and medications. Great item to have!</li>
    <li> Using this as my essential oil display!</li>
    <li> I had ordered this, but the first time I received it I got it broken with pieces missing. So, I reported it and they were extremely helpful and gave me an exchange. When I got my replacement it came cracked on the side, but nothing tape couldn&#x27;t fix so it won&#x27;t break. Other than the problems mentioned this nail polish rack is great. I like it.</li>
    <li> Recieved cracked and damaged... Too lazy to send back. Fits its purpuse and others cant tell its damaged. I am happy with this product....</li>
    <li> This is a MUST HAVE for those who have a lot of nail polishes.  The assembly took 5 minutes and when I was done putting all of my nail colors in, I felt like I was at a nail salon getting a manicure b/c the display was so beautiful and it looks so professional.  I was able to put 67 bottles in (some of my bottles are small).  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was b/c the side cracked a little when it arrived. It&#x27;s not that noticeable, thankfully, b/c it&#x27;s on the side but still.  I absolutely LOVE THIS!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my niece for Christmas and it looks really cool.  It was on her Christmas list, so probably won&#x27;t be too much of a surprise, but it appears to be a cool item!  I inspected it when I received it and it looks to be in great condition (nothing broken that I could see).  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nice, large polish organizer.  Good quality, sturdy, good looking.  Would purchase again.  It stores different types of bottles nicely. Luv it.</li>
    <li> This case houses 50 nail polishes perfectly. My daughter was just as thrilled w/ this, as she was the nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish rack! Keeps all my nail polishes organized and easy to find....It&#x27;s Grrrreat!  I totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I wish it was a bit easier to put together because I kept messing up and yet I don&#x27;t really have experience putting things like this together. I wish it was a bit more durable but thats what you get with plastic. My sister came into my room trying to kill a moth that she let in through her window with a box. The box fell on it and broke it. I am not so sure if I want a new one since I don&#x27;t have all that much room.</li>
    <li> I only gave a star because i had to.&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs down!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The display picture is misleading. This is not what I got and when I tried to return it, my request was rejected. I have never been this pissed about an Amazon purchase. Now I have to find someone to sell or give it too.</li>
    <li> I love that it holds all my nail polish I have sixty bottles. I just thought it should be cheaper because its plastic. However I couldn&#x27;t find anything for cheaper hat would hold sixty bottles</li>
    <li> I purchased for my 16 yr old its a great size. Not too bulky. Sits on a dresser or vanity perfectly.Great buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not only did it come broken, but it was not the five shelf unit pictured that I recieved and by the way it was even pictured on the packaging box as the five shelf, it was the six shelf with smaller width shevles that I got.  Who checks these things?</li>
    <li> This was made of very thin plastic.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough.I&#x27;m afraid it may not last very long.I&#x27;m hoping it does</li>
    <li> I purchased this to hold the 48 piece nail color set that I purchased for my teen daughter for Christmas. The item arrived quickly and in great shape. It was easy to assemble and she had her polishes set up in no time.</li>
    <li> easy to assemble, looks as it does in the picture.  fits regular OPI bottles, revlon, and so on.  I have to turn the &#x27;Nicole by OPI&#x27; bottles sideways, but not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife as she had all her nail polish bottles in a box under the sink.&lt;br /&gt;This was a great way to organize them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem was that it arrived with a small piece broken off one of the sides.&lt;br /&gt;It did not effect the integrity of the item so I just kept it.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Now I can see all my nail polishes instead of dumping out my basket every time I paint my nails.  I bought 2 of them, and they are almost full (I&#x27;m a nail polish junkie) - it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to orgainize my nail polish.  It fits in my cabinet perfectly, and when I am looking for a certain color, they are neatly organized by hues.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for at home use.  When the package was delivered I opened it to find that it was broken on one side and no way to repair it.  It looked different from the one in the picture and was actually much larger.  It is very cheap made and poorly designed. I would caution anyone wanting to purchase this item...Look else where...save your money and time.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great &amp; exactly what I was looking for but the packaging was terrible. Received this and it was cracked on each side stand. Luckily was able to super glue it back together.</li>
    <li> I use this in my tattoo studio for my ink bottles. It holds 1oz and 2oz round bottles perfectly. Clear so I can see all of my colors, and I have had many compliments on it from other artists. It does make my life much easier when I&#x27;m working.</li>
    <li> Handy for my Alcohol Ink collection.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping.  I would have given it 5 stars but it is much bigger than I thought and take up all my vanity space.  Other than that I like it.</li>
    <li> The shipping on this was fast, and it was a breeze to put together! It took maybe like 5 minutes, and then I was ready to put polish on it! Right now, I have about 50 ish bottles of polish, and I have quite a bit of room left. So it does hold roughly 60 bottles.</li>
    <li> All my fingernail polish at my fingertips, I can see what colors I have, what colors I want and love love love the organization of having it all in one place</li>
    <li> Great nail polish rack, it just unstuck when I opened the package; I had to krazy glue a few pieces back together</li>
    <li> One of the backs to the screw didn&#x27;t fit. These screws keep the side panels in place. Which is very important. I&#x27;m so upset. So now, I have to go out to find one to replace it.</li>
    <li> excellent to organize your nail polish easy to see and reach</li>
    <li> Have had this for a year. Love it!!! Sturdy and can see all of my nail polishes @ a glance.</li>
    <li> it is an ok unit but way to much money for a piece of plastic  I am looking to buy the same type of item elsewhere</li>
    <li> It was easy to assemble and it holds ALL of my nail polishes regardless of brand. It works are both an organization tool and a display case so I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Really liked this except it didn&#x27;t come with screws. Had to dig around to find some spares at home</li>
    <li> Very fast shipment . Very well packaged . Solidly made quality product . Holds my essential oils perfectly. I ordered 3 more now that I know how great this product is</li>
    <li> I originally purchased two  racks to use in my hair salon, when it arrived I only received one but paid for two. The one I received was damaged. After contacting Beauticom about the missing rack and the damaged one it took  a couple more weeks to get the replacements. The racks were packaged in boxes with very little styrofoam packing and the boxes were heavily damaged in shipment.  Once again, one rack was damaged and the other was OK, I am not going to do anything about the broken one because I am pretty much done with this company, this process has taken about five weeks and I still only have one rack that is useable. The racks are exactly what I was looking but very dissatisfied with the service. Products either need to be packed better or find another method of shipment.</li>
    <li> The screws were not included with this product.  My grandaughter was very disapointed she wasn&#x27;t able to use set it up</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to paint her nails and change her polish like every other day so you can imagine how many polishes she owns.  This is a great product, well made, and easy to put together and of couse we need another.</li>
    <li> Easy to put together and very sturdy</li>
    <li> Perfect for essential oils!!</li>
    <li> This is a great rack for my polish, but it is not as sturdy as I was hoping</li>
    <li> This rack was easy to set up and fits well on a shelf. I have multiple different brands of nail polish (China Glaze, OPI, Sally Hansen, Orly, Avon) and it doesn&#x27;t fit quite 60. I was able to put about 54 with some of the bottles turned to the side. It&#x27;s still a good product and better than just having the nail polishes on a table or in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I received the actual item that is pictured and described. I was unsure which rack I would receive since many reviewers say they got a six shelf one with smaller ledges. But I received the pictured item and love it! It has five large rows which hold all the different types of nail polish that I own, even the bigger bottles. It fits perfectly on a shelf in my bathroom and is easy to move around. It was simple to put together, there are two small screws on each side that you use to screw the side support onto the shelves. This is exactly what I wanted to store my nail polish and be able to see all the colors when I am deciding which one to use. I recommend this product if you have the room for it (it is about 15&amp;#34; wide so it takes up a decent amount of space).</li>
    <li> Great way to get organized! I ordered this item and it came just as expected. It did not come with assembly instructions but I was able to figure it out after 5 minutes. I am using it for both nail polish and MAC eyeshadow. Top three rows hold 12 bottles of OPI. Bottom two rows hold 10 shadows. I love that I can see all the shades I have without having to rummage through bags and bags of stuff! Great buy!</li>
    <li> It came chipped but decided to use it anyway rather that send it back and it works fine.  Really nice to have.</li>
    <li> fits all my polishes!!</li>
    <li> Good product, looks good on bathroom counter</li>
    <li> It would have been a great product if there were holes on the other side for the screws to go in. So basically I have 1 functioning side. Obviously these things don&#x27;t go through inspection before shipping.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Larger than I expected but I&#x27;m not complaining. Only issue what it was chipped in one spot upon arrival. I fixed it and it works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to use as a rack for my paints (I am a miniatures gamer). It fits several different manufacturers perfectly. Has cleaned up my painting desk immensely and looks really sharp as a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend the product for anyone looking to clean up a space with a lot of little bottles, whether it be miniatures paints, nail polish or anything else!</li>
    <li> Fits all my polishes nicely and makes my makeup area look neat and tidy.  Was easy to put together and looks good.</li>
    <li> The rack is very long and I find it hard to place on my split vanity. So my suggestion is to measure your placement before purchase. The rack have attachable sides that&#x27;s easy to screw together by hand only. I would recommend friends to buy</li>
    <li> This product was crackle in three places when I received it. Cheap!</li>
    <li> Arrived broken where legs connect. Due to work conflicts I was unable to ship item back but returns are possible. I decided to live with it and fixed the broken legs myself. Doesn&#x27;t look nice but oh well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this rack!  It&#x27;s the perfect size and exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Easy to put together, all it has is four screws and bots. A great acrylic it seems heavy duty, and for he price you wouldn&#x27;t think so. I will be ordering another one since this does not fit all of my polish, but now I can see my full collection very clearly now. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product quick delivery</li>
    <li> I purchased from MizzStar and the product was exactly as described!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> perfect condition, fits many more than the 60 bottles that it states so that&#x27;s even better! hated spending that much but at least now i can see all of my polishes!</li>
    <li> Perfect size to store essential oils!</li>
    <li> Does exactly as described.Hold all my polishes in a neat and organized way.I own two of these racks.they are holding up nicely.</li>
    <li> WE JUST SET IT UP YESTERDAY.  MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED IT!  I WILL BE PURCHASING A SECOND ONE.  AT LEAST ALL HER POLISHES ARE IN ONE PLACE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two previous racks, i recently ordered another and selected the reorder function within my account info. I received a rack that has 4 rows not five and is much smaller in size than the previous ones. Highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> So excited about filling it up, I&#x27;m half way there lol.  My grandkids love it also :)&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying more of them. Very kool idea... Thanx A Bunch</li>
    <li> I gave the product 4 stars because one of the screws provided with the product wouldn&#x27;t fit into the washer.  I had to purchase one that did fit in order for the stand to be stable.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Had a crack in the acrylic, thankfully hasn&#x27;t come apart though.</li>
    <li> Finally a place to put all my nail polishes-I have them organized by brand and it&#x27;s now so easy to find just what i need at a glance. Beats the heck out of the big basket I used to keep them in.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish rack. It fits the amount of nail polish it says it will. I use mine for OPI and China Glaze, I do have 1 bottle of Nicole and I got it to fit by turning it to its side. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works great as a display case for essential oils</li>
    <li> Very simple to put together, perfect for my dresser and its perfect to display my nail polish collection.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these nail polish racks, both showed up with chips in the acrylic and one of them came with a screw that did not fit, so I had to run to a hardware store to get a new one. Not very good quality control.</li>
    <li> The side panels arrived with 2 cracks but the display was still functional so I decided to keep it.  It would have been too much hassel to return it.  The unit was easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> I needed something to organize my polish disaster.  This did the trick.  This makes it much easier to find the color you want and keep things neat.</li>
    <li> This product was great.....once I finally put it together. I don&#x27;t know if it was just me but it was hard to put together. I didn&#x27;t receive any directions. But overall fabulous product!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Carefully packaged.  Well wrapped acrylic pieces all were covered to prevent scratches.  Take care during assembly and this will be shiny and new forever.</li>
    <li> This display rack is exactly what I was searching for.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to set up. It fits many bottles of nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;The price was best compared to other racks. Very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price</li>
    <li> Disappointed to see the item had arrived broken.</li>
    <li> Love this handy display.  Easy to assemble - so screwdriver needed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect to sit on the dresser or counter and have all of your polish neatly organized. It is easy to assemble and shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> GOOD, PERFECT FOR THE DISPLAY I NEEDED</li>
    <li> I rarely leave reviews but I thought I&#x27;d share my thoughts on this nail polish rack. First, it came right on time. However, upon opening the box within a box I discovered that mine had the exact same break in the top corner as one of the above pictures except my corner is completely broken off.  It also has a small crack near the break off. Even after reading reviews I didn&#x27;t think that would happen to me but it did. I don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle or time to take a trip to UPS to do a replacement so I&#x27;ll keep it and super glue it, something I shouldn&#x27;t have to do with a NEW item. Maybe if the company used better packing materials such as a better quality bubble wrap, they could avoid their customers receiving damaged merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as putting the rack together, it took under 2 minutes to screw the sides on. You could use a butter knife if you don&#x27;t have a screwdriver. I love that it holds all my nail polishes like OPI, Essie, Butter London, Revlon, etc. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be moving this rack around too much to avoid more damage. In the future I would spend a little more money on a higher grade acrylic to avoid taking a chance on a damaged product and wasting my time and money.</li>
    <li> This arrived broken. We glued it back together and my daughter organized her nail polishes only to find that where the polish bottle contacted the plastic, it discolored the bottle. What in the world is this made out of? Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is just what it say . now have to order another one because I have more polishes .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed mine was a bit broken I had to use crazy glue I don&#x27;t think this is my job to do</li>
    <li> Great to store all my nail polish bottles.</li>
    <li> Got this for my granddaughter&#x27;s many, many bottles of polish and it works great for her.  She can easily find the polish and helps her stay organized.</li>
    <li> I bought this rack for all of my nail polishes, it was easy to ensemble but took up too much space it fell off my table 3 times which broke a few of my nail polishes .. I ended up throwing it away and making my own rack on the wall. Would not repurchase unless I had a lot of table space</li>
    <li> Broken in 4 places, no screws to put together, had to use my own.  Would not recommend.</li>
