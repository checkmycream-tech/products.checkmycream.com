<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nexus is MY SHAMPOO !!&lt;br /&gt;I just have nothing else to say! It&#x27;s PERFEC for my brokn hair :D</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. I have fine hair and it works perfectly for it.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this, I did a little research. What a surprise. These products did exactly what it said. I was sold!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good these products work!&lt;br /&gt;They are absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;They make my hair soft and literally tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;I just went into get my hair done last week and my hair dresser noticed my split ends were disappearing and she commented on how fast my hair was growing and how soft and shiny it was. Defiantly recommend!</li>
    <li> Yes, it met all my wifes expectations thank you</li>
    <li> Bought this as a treat have always wanted to try it and decided to go ahead and just get it.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much but I am generally happy with the product and what it does for me. I used to have long thick coarse hair, I always thought it was pretty straight, a few curls or waves here and there.. Now I am a wee bit older I have found my hair has its own personality It is now thinner, just as coarse and I have ringlets, whether I want them or not. My hair falls about halfway down my back. The Nexxus Shampoo it great. You need much less than what you think you do. It lathers and lathers and lathers. Rinses out easily and leaves my hair like I just conditioned it. The conditioner seems to work a little of the opposite it feels like it takes some of the moisture out . I can still run my fingers through my hair after conditioning but it did take a few uses to get acquainted  to it. The leave in conditioner is nice, and isn&#x27;t greasy or oily. absorbs and leaves no residue.  The scents of them all are nice. I would buy this again.  It is just different from store products and what our accustomed to. This was a hard choice as I was deciding between Redken and Nexxus.</li>
    <li> I have very fine , naturally light blonde hair. My hair tends to break very easily and doesn&#x27;t seem to grow very much. Since I started using pro mend, my hair is longer than it&#x27;s ever been in my  entire life (39yrs) and I have virtually no split ends! I&#x27;m in love with this stuff!</li>
    <li> even though I have fine hair, this is not too heavy for me unless I use both the conditioner and leave-in treatment daily. alternating it&#x27;s perfect and I really notice a healthy difference in feel and look for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, sun-bleached long hair and live in the desert with dust and low humidity. I was having a problem with split ends when I tried Pro Mend, and immediately I could run a brush through my hair after washing it and no tangled ends. This stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip - a little of the treatment cream goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Good bargain, can&#x27;t find it a Sam&#x27;s Club anymore. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> really did not notice much of a change</li>
    <li> Prefer the Humecctress</li>
    <li> The price for these products are unbelievable</li>
    <li> They shipped it very fast! Love the product x</li>
    <li> I have very thick, very wavy long hair that I blow dry and flat iron every day. I also color frequently, all of which leaves me with lots of unhealthy split ends. I started out with just the leave-in treatment (which smells AMAZING!) because the shampoo and conditioner are really hard to find in stores (and expensive when I can find them). The leave-in helps, especially with flyaways and frizz, but it wasn&#x27;t helping enough. Let me say, the shampoo, conditioner and leave-in treatment together are AWESOME! The shampoo is gentle and really helps to detangle. The conditioner is very rich but surprisingly not heavy. I combed the conditioner through my hair and left in for the rest of my shower, then rinsed and followed up with the leave-in after towel drying. After styling, I smoothed a tiny (dime-sized) amount of the leave-in over my ends for added smoothness. My hair is silky, soft and shiny, and smells WONDERFUL! It really does help with split ends!  Separately, this 3-part system would cost over $60, so Amazon definitely is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I love these products and I can&#x27;t find a better price for them anywhere!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Nexxus fanatic for about 20 years. I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds of their shampoos and condtioners. I like this one the best of all that I&#x27;ve tried. It works really well on my hair which is long, straight and fine.It smells awesome too!</li>
    <li> The Pro-Mend set of shampoo and conditioners has helped my hair - tremendously. I had lost my hair from being very sick along with a horrible treatment. I needed something to help restore the remaining 3 strands - JK - but this has added strength, shine and elasticity back into my hair. I do recommend the &amp;#34;Nexxus Pro-Mend Split End Binding Straightening Lotion&amp;#34; as a final conditioning - it helps bind split ends and really feels like a fresh cut - I give the Pro-Mend series 5 stars</li>
