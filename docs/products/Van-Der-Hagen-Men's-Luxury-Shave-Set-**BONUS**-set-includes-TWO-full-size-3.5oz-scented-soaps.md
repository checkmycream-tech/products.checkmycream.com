      <li>Everything is great except the stand.  </li>
      <li>For the money it is a great product.  </li>
      <li>item is great but did not come with the two &amp;#34;bonus soap&amp;#34; as stated when reaching the seller they were out of the soap and gave me a 10% discount.</li>
      <li>Overal great for a beginner.</li>

      <li>Just got this set and is awesome although I got it a Targ&#x27;et for $20 so way better price</li>
      <li>The soap dispenser is aesthetically pleasing, and the soaps provided are pleasant.</li>
      <li>but if you think you&#x27;ll going to luv shaving with safety razor and money is not an issue then don&#x27;t be cheap a$$&amp; invest in the awesome kits with virgin unicorn brushes, gold dust soap, diamond/gem encrusted mug and Adamantium safety razors.</li>
      <li>I think it is a good alternative to the &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; line.</li>
      <li>I bought this for a gift and the person loved it.</li>
      <li>This is good as a starter kit.</li>
      <li>Grandson was very pleased.......</li>
      <li>I love the apothecary cup as it whips up GREAT shaving cream.</li>
      <li>Nice starter kit all you need is a good safety razor to go with it.</li>
      <li>The soap lathers nicely and smell good.</li>
      <li>I have used boar brushes over the years and have not been impressed when they fell apart after 5 or 6 years, but I have also not been treating them right.</li>
      <li>and I know he will love it!</li>
      <li>This tea has a delicious soothing flavor that I like to drink hot.  </li>
      <li>It looks nice.</li>
      <li>I really recomend this for anyone is a great starter deal!</li>
      <li>Nice set.</li>
      <li>Looked like a good deal, but like most things, you get what you pay for.  </li>
      <li>The soap has a nice, not overpowering, scent.</li>
      <li>He says it&#x27;s nicely made and</li>
      <li>Packaged nicely and arrived as described.  </li>
      <li>The brush has held up nicely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unique and a great value.</li>
      <li>The soaps that are included smell great and was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>They do lather up to look nice, but they don&#x27;t lubricate or protect as well as some more quality soaps.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a unique \\&quot;nostalgic\\&quot; item that was a good find.</li>
      <li>Chanda&#x27;s Stuff was considerate, quick, and extremely pleasant to order from</li>
      <li>The soap evaporates on face pretty quickly, so its best to lather one side, shave one side, then lather again and repeat.  </li>
      <li>This is the first shaving set I&#x27;ve owned, and it is great for a starter kit.  </li>
      <li>My first hand brush after years of shaving in the shower and this is great.</li>
      <li>okay,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s bigger than a coffe mug :D</li>
      <li>brush handle is nice &amp; is made of plastic though which I really dont mind as the brissles is doing its thing great lather uP soap to get a purrfect shave and get your skin baby smooth to get them cougars pouncing on you</li>
      <li>But there is better available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I have heard its better than the VDH soap.</li>
      <li>Love the soap bowl and included soaps.  </li>
      <li>What more can you ask of it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been enjoying the products I have received.</li>
      <li>if you get it thru Targ&#x27;et make sure they have it on stock call ahead even if the website states they are in stock</li>
      <li>If you are a noob as I was then this would be a cheap yet nice fancy looking starter kit to begin with :)  after sucking it uP when carving your face&amp;getting used to it then maybe</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: After being able to contact the company that shipped out the product in this review</li>
      <li>You can buy this brush by itself for $26, but there are better brushes for $10 all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but there are MUCH better options.</li>
      <li>It looked okay when I first got it, but now the bristles have lost their shape and it looked like I just pulled it out of grandpa&#x27;s attic (not in the good way).</li>
      <li>The soap smells pretty good and masks</li>
      <li>It may be pure badger, but you&#x27;re better off getting off good boar instead of this.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product from Chanda&#x27;s Stuff for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday and was more than happy with the quality of the product and pleasantly surprised by the quality of the service.</li>
      <li>great set for getting into more traditional shaving</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It always has a strong, palatable taste.</li>
      <li>Nice functional product at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>and it works fine now</li>
      <li>The brush and razor stand is too light, so I purchased a stand that also holds the mug.</li>
      <li>Brush is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I am also finding it takes a light touch</li>
      <li>I enjoy the scent of the soap as well as the feeling of the brush as I lather it on.</li>
      <li>the holder is nice too very sturdy for brush and razor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Received my playthings early, a good thing.</li>
      <li>Got this product super quick!</li>
      <li>Another reviewer gives \\&quot;5 easy steps\\&quot; which I found useful.</li>
      <li>The stand is functional and convenient, providing a space to hang your brush to dry (very important) alongside your razor (not provided in the kit -- I had my own).</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is also not the promised full size 3.5oz</li>
      <li>If your going to go out of your way to say you&#x27;re getting something in the product&#x27;s title, then you really should make sure it&#x27;s included when shipped.  </li>
      <li>I had the privilege of introducing my son to &amp;#34;the manly art of shaving&amp;#34; Using warm lather like the old time barber shops.&lt;br</li>
      <li>hope somebody at Amazon will read this and do the right thing and send the product I was supposed to get free of charge...</li>
      <li>and yes right next to it they also sell shaving soaps for cheap in case you want extras!!</li>
      <li>Actually bought one for myself and another for a friend after seeing how nice it was.</li>
      <li>The only trade off is that the bonus shave soaps that come with this package are not luxury soaps as is implied, but rather deluxe lime scented glycerine soaps.</li>
      <li>The actual kit is great, but this particular seller is very misleading in the description and photos.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this as a gift for the right person.  </li>
      <li>it would be the right thing to do, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but it has a very neutral, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping and exactly as described!</li>
      <li>I was able to super glue this back together</li>
      <li>This is a great kit for starting out with a safety razor but the brush looses bristles daily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My biggest complaint about ordering this product was that it did not come with the **BONUS**.  If your going to go out of your way to say you&#x27;re getting something in the product&#x27;s title, then you really should make sure it&#x27;s included when shipped.  Maybe it was a while supplies last thing, or maybe the person who put my order together was out to late the night before and simply forgot.  Either way the product did not arrive as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The items that did arrive look exactly like they do it the picture.  The brush appears to be slightly better than low end.  The mug and stand do what they should. I have not used the soap yet but it has a very neutral, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: The brush broke on me after about 5 uses.  The top section with the bristles seperated from the handle during regular use.  I was able to super glue this back together and it works fine now but it was disappointing when it happened.</li>
    <li> Though it states it comes with two soaps the second soap isn&#x27;t a Van Der Hagen like I thought it would be,  The second soap isn&#x27;t really what I was looking for and I think they should state that it comes with just a toss in for the second bar.  If I had known this sooner I would have just bought the regular set and another Van Der Hagen soap on the side rather than pay around 10$ more for a soap that is sold on amazon for 5$ that I didn&#x27;t even want. The package did come early and well kept but just really disappointed with the second bar...</li>
    <li> this is a great set whoever posted the reviews about the brush falling apart obviously doesn&#x27;t know how to use it if you the proper way this will last you a very long time</li>
    <li> Glad I went back to shaving 55 years,ago, feel fresher and cleaner</li>
    <li> A gift for my husband. It&#x27;s just what he wanted!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this.  I enjoy the scent of the soap as well as the feeling of the brush as I lather it on.</li>
    <li> Just got this set and is awesome although I got it a Targ&#x27;et for $20 so way better price and yes right next to it they also sell shaving soaps for cheap in case you want extras!! the soap holder is bigger than I though it was going to be it&#x27;s bigger than a coffe mug :D brush handle is nice &amp; is made of plastic though which I really dont mind as the brissles is doing its thing great lather uP soap to get a purrfect shave and get your skin baby smooth to get them cougars pouncing on you ;) the holder is nice too very sturdy for brush and razor. I really recomend this for anyone is a great starter deal! So dont hesitate get moving and get this asap!&lt;br /&gt; if you get it thru Targ&#x27;et make sure they have it on stock call ahead even if the website states they are in stock so your fancy shopping experience wont be ruined!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As another reviwer found out the Targ&#x27;et set is identical EXCEPT that the brush is not badger and instead boar! If you are a noob as I was then this would be a cheap yet nice fancy looking starter kit to begin with :)  after sucking it uP when carving your face&amp;getting used to it then maybe yeah time to uPgrade :D but if you think you&#x27;ll going to luv shaving with safety razor and money is not an issue then don&#x27;t be cheap a$$&amp; invest in the awesome kits with virgin unicorn brushes, gold dust soap, diamond/gem encrusted mug and Adamantium safety razors.</li>
    <li> My husband was looking at one of these shaving sets. Never used one. He loves loves loves it. Says its the only way for a man to shave. The brush has held up nicely. The soap lathers nicely and smell good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for a really good price. I really like the black minimalist design and the brush feels very good.</li>
    <li> great set for getting into more traditional shaving</li>
    <li> What can I say?  For the money it is a great product.  Only complaint is the razor likes to tip out of the holder occasionally.</li>
    <li> Looked like a good deal, but like most things, you get what you pay for.  The badger brush smells like fresh wet badger ass and even worse when dipped in hot water.  On 3rd use the badger fur fell out of handle, but superglue seems to be holding it in.  The soap smells pretty good and masks the badger ass smell pretty well and it seems to be dwindling.  The soap evaporates on face pretty quickly, so its best to lather one side, shave one side, then lather again and repeat.  It&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. High quality. Actually bought one for myself and another for a friend after seeing how nice it was.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift and he loves it. The soap has a nice, not overpowering, scent. Nice gift if you are looking for something a little different.</li>
    <li> The man I bought it for was  very happy to get this item for Christmas.  I was shopping at a local store one day and a question and idea came to me what if I found a product that would meet all the shaving needs at home but feel like it is a barber shop experience? And I found this product on Amazon and works great</li>
    <li> Everything is great except the stand.  It is a little too light for the brush and razor, and tends to tip over.  Nevertheless, it is a great value.</li>
    <li> Soap is OK, brush is horrible.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift and the person loved it. He tried it out right away and didn&#x27;t have a negative thing to say. The soaps that are included smell great and was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This is a great kit for starting out with a safety razor but the brush looses bristles daily. I love the apothecary cup as it whips up GREAT shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This tea has a delicious soothing flavor that I like to drink hot.  It always has a strong, palatable taste.</li>
    <li> Grandson was very pleased.......young ya know.  You know it&#x27;s hard to come up with a line of crap for this stuff.....ya either like it or ya don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time wet shave user. I have a beard but trim it very close to my face and I use this kit to shave the hair that grows by my eyes and my neck.  I&#x27;ve always wanted to try this method instead of just using everyday soap. I would recommend this to any &amp;#34;first timer&amp;#34; to get the hang of it and then go out and get other products and give it a try.  Thanks</li>
    <li> the brush Fell a part in a month.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Chanda&#x27;s Stuff for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday and was more than happy with the quality of the product and pleasantly surprised by the quality of the service. Chanda&#x27;s Stuff was considerate, quick, and extremely pleasant to order from and I will definitely consider them as my first stop for beauty products (for men and women!) in the future. Great people and great products!</li>
    <li> Nice functional product at a very reasonable price. No issues whatsoever and stand functions well to hold both brush and razor in a space saving manner.</li>
    <li> Got this product super quick! Got it for a wedding gift for my fiance and I know he will love it! Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> Gave this kit to the man in my life as something different.  He shaves his head almost every day and prefers the brush &amp; lather rather than the spray on foam or gel. He says it&#x27;s nicely made and it&#x27;s really easy to use.  The soap/lather is not too heavily scented or perfumed so it doesn&#x27;t clash any time he uses cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a unique \\&quot;nostalgic\\&quot; item that was a good find.</li>
    <li> I had the privilege of introducing my son to &amp;#34;the manly art of shaving&amp;#34; Using warm lather like the old time barber shops.&lt;br /&gt;He was surprised by the much closer shave and his fiancé liked how soft his cheeks were.</li>
    <li> The ordered products arrived within the stated delivery period.&lt;br /&gt;However, besides of the advertised regular Van Der Hagen shave set, it did not come with the pictured second Van Der Hagen soap.&lt;br /&gt;The second soap is a Col. Conk in which I was not interrested...or I would have ordered it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;It is also not the promised full size 3.5oz as advertised, but only a 2 1/4oz. soap.&lt;br /&gt;I am not impressed with cheap practises like this even when it only concerns a piece of soap... I did end up paying more for less since I could have just ordered the regular Van Der Hagen set and order an extra Van Der Hagen soap block and save myself 5 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;I hope somebody at Amazon will read this and do the right thing and send the product I was supposed to get free of charge... it would be the right thing to do, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I am not all that surprised this happened. It seems to be norm at Amazon rather then the exception having read tons of similar reviews on a wide variety of products..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After being able to contact the company that shipped out the product in this review I was told I would be send the missing soap.&lt;br /&gt;Within a week I did receive a whole new shave set (instead of just the soap I didn&#x27;t get and asked for) that once again had the wrong second piece of Col. Conk soap with it.&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to contact them again ... but they should really check out what it is they ship out and if it is consistent with the advertised merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;I did get that second piece of soap after all and everything else I did get in the first place so I&#x27;m not complaining anymore.&lt;br /&gt;And I have been enjoying the products I have received. So far they have been very adequate.</li>
    <li> The brush, while not a top notch badger brush, is a wonderful brush for the price, the considering the financial outlay for this set, I would imagine it would be difficult to find similar quality at the same price</li>
    <li> This is the first shaving set I&#x27;ve owned, and it is great for a starter kit.  The brush is a little bit cheap, a couple of the bristles fall out each time I use it, but not so much that it&#x27;s going to be unusable any time soon.  I&#x27;m not an expert on shaving soaps either, but the scent is nothing great.  I&#x27;d like to try something else out, like almond or sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to someone just starting out, but it definitely would not impress someone who has been DE shaving for while.</li>
    <li> The brush is great for the price, and the soaps smell good.  Not too fragranty for a man. Overal great for a beginner.</li>
    <li> The actual kit is great, but this particular seller is very misleading in the description and photos. The second soap is not van der Hagen as others have noticed, in mine it was col conks bay rum. I could have bought that soap and the kit separately from amazon and paid less. Very disappointed with these business practices on amazon, and surprised that with all of the reviews like this, that amazon has not addressed the issue with the seller</li>
    <li> All you need to get great shaves except the razor.  Love the soap bowl and included soaps.  Brush is fantastic.  I feel like I got a complete, quality shave set for the price of the brush.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a birthday present for my brother and he was very excited for it.  I think it is a good alternative to the &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; line.</li>
    <li> Nothing special, but completely functional and keeps thing organized.  Dish is deep enough, and soap is nice.  I ordered extra brushes and soap.</li>
    <li> Nice starter kit all you need is a good safety razor to go with it.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a birthday gift to a friend and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Happy that the gift works out.</li>
    <li> Packaged nicely and arrived as described.  Very happy with gift!!!</li>
    <li> Good Product Bad Advertisement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is great but did not come with the two &amp;#34;bonus soap&amp;#34; as stated when reaching the seller they were out of the soap and gave me a 10% discount. Very happy with the brush and the cup and stand. My first hand brush after years of shaving in the shower and this is great. Seller needs to get their act together; I usually do not expect this from an Amazon seller.</li>
    <li> the extra soap isn&#x27;t Van Der Hagen. Everything in this kit is mediocre but a good spot to start. extra words.</li>
    <li> This is good as a starter kit.</li>
    <li> Got this for my fiancé for Christmas and he loved it! He absolutely raves about it and tells me at least once a week that its the coolest gift he&#x27;s ever gotten. Super fast shipping and exactly as described! Thank you!</li>
    <li> A very good set for the price. The mug alone was very costly on other sites and the handle knob is comfortable. The brush and razor stand is too light, so I purchased a stand that also holds the mug.</li>
    <li> I like this set the brush actually came apart the first time I used it but I popped it back together been using it ever since</li>
    <li> Great Father&#x27;s Day gift for my Dad and my husband. Both report a cleaner shave with the product.</li>
    <li> This shave kit has served me well. The only trade off is that the bonus shave soaps that come with this package are not luxury soaps as is implied, but rather deluxe lime scented glycerine soaps. Still lathered well, it was just a bit of  a surprise.</li>
    <li> I have been using a shave brush for about 20 years, ever since Gillette had an all in one. The shave cream was in a cartridge in the handle of the brush. Someone tried to revive it a couple of years ago but it apparently did not fly. I have a double edge \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot; from 40 years ago. It was not any safer back then, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received my playthings early, a good thing. Tried them out with a new blade, the 100 blades for $8. I am figuring out the correct formula for the amount of water, about three to four shakes will give you a good lather, rather thick. This is better quality soap, rather than the cheaper VDH (green box), thick and maybe more glide. I will see how the COL Conk does in a few months, and then see if Williams is better or worse. I am also finding it takes a light touch or you will slice and dice your face and neck. My razor also has an adjustment for angle of the blade so you will have to experiment with that also. Another reviewer gives \\&quot;5 easy steps\\&quot; which I found useful. I have used boar brushes over the years and have not been impressed when they fell apart after 5 or 6 years, but I have also not been treating them right. I will see how the silver tip badger does. I am still loosing a couple bristles per shave after a month but time will tell. Still life is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is doing its thing, a little light so therefore slides on the vanity. Some other stands you can attach to the wall, nay. The mug fits the soap and the soap fits the mug. The \\&quot;wet dog\\&quot; smell was gone in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my father-in-law.  I thought it seemed really made well,  not cheap.  The cup did arrive broken but the company replaced it with no hassles... even in time for Christmas. I would recommend this as a gift for the right person.  It&#x27;s unique and a great value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll rate each of the items here individually:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VDH soap: This is the luxury version of VDH soaps, and it is probably better than the regular one. However, I do not like their soaps in general. They do lather up to look nice, but they don&#x27;t lubricate or protect as well as some more quality soaps. The smell is...decent. There are better though, even in the low price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is actually my least favorite part of this. It may be pure badger, but you&#x27;re better off getting off good boar instead of this. The knot is weak, as is the glue. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and I lose about 5 hairs with every shave. I&#x27;m going to have a bald brush before too long. It looked okay when I first got it, but now the bristles have lost their shape and it looked like I just pulled it out of grandpa&#x27;s attic (not in the good way). It holds water okay, but there are MUCH better options. You can buy this brush by itself for $26, but there are better brushes for $10 all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mug is decent. It&#x27;s a mug. It looks nice. What more can you ask of it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same goes with the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second soap it comes with is a Col. Conk soap, which is glycerine based. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I have heard its better than the VDH soap. Lets hope thats true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because, for the price, it works. It will get you wetshaving, and for hardly any money. But there is better available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was $35 when I purchased, for future reference.</li>
    <li> This kit is just what I needed to start wet shaving. The badger hair brush is top-notch and the best part of this kit. The stand is functional and convenient, providing a space to hang your brush to dry (very important) alongside your razor (not provided in the kit -- I had my own). The soap dispenser is aesthetically pleasing, and the soaps provided are pleasant.</li>
    <li> my father in law loves it</li>
    <li> Nice set. What is annoying is that the hair is coming out and ends up on my face.&lt;br /&gt; Soap very good.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think it would be THAT big but it&#x27;s for men so the shaving dish is large. Shipping was fast but the actual box it came in was a little damaged, kinda of flimsy and seemed like it had been previously opened. Regardless mmy BF loved the gift ans uses it all the time!</li>
