### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>from those around me as to how wonderful the scent is on</li>
      <li>Probably the best perfume, I have ever used</li>
      <li>I just hope it lasts longer on skin, then it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>Perfect for spring and summer.</li>
      <li>Perfect combo.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>The longevity is excellent for a citrus based fragrance (6 - 8 hours).</li>
      <li>It has been awesome.</li>
      <li>Powdery, very pleasant, is well suited for work or play.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This is simply fantastic!!!</li>
      <li>You can try it at most good department stores, but the best price is at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Loved it.</li>
      <li>It smells good when I spray it</li>
      <li>I was introduced to the Guerlain perfume at the Macy&#x27;s perfume section, and I loved Guerlain Homme ever since.</li>
      <li>Very elegant and understated, I&#x27;ve used it and gotten compliments, when I tell my friends</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This has been my first Guerlain try and experience has been wonderful; its peppermint, lemon and brown sugar \\&quot;melange\\&quot; plays with your mind and feelings.</li>
      <li>This arrived promptly (amazon prime), the bottle is beautiful and streamlined, the scent is very fresh and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>What an amazing earthy, floral cologne formen.</li>
      <li>From the start, I get a very nice sweet lime with some mint in the background.</li>
      <li>My husband travels with this as the bottle is very strong and packable and does not leak.</li>
      <li>loved it, great scent, highly recommend to all men, sophisticated.</li>
      <li>From the box I was already excited that it smelled like lime Kool-Aid with a good amount of sugar.</li>
      <li>but love the smell</li>
      <li>Guerlain for Men Eau de Toilette has more of a citrus fragrance.</li>
      <li>But on the skin, I get so much more.</li>
      <li>With this being a Woody Aromatic, I&#x27;m sure others will be able to detect this on you well after the 4 hour mark.</li>
      <li>Sexy, heady scent.</li>
      <li>I got to say, I really enjoy this!</li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is better than any, even duty free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a classic for sure!</li>
      <li>I received the product and was excited to have gotten it for such a great price.</li>
      <li>His new favorite!</li>
      <li>This Eau de Toilette has a clean and non aggressive scent.</li>
      <li>cause Amazon had it much cheaper than most department stores.</li>
      <li>If you like a fresh, clean scent that doesn&#x27;t arrive before you do, or linger after you&#x27;ve gone, try this one.</li>
      <li>After purchasing L&#x27;Instant and really enjoying the quality of a Guerlain fragrance, I was interested to see how they could do a more modern/popular take on a summer fragrance.</li>
      <li>A really fresh lime with mint and a touch of vetiver.</li>
      <li>I can kind of detect another citrus note (maybe the bergamot), but sweet lime and mint is center stage.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t too much of a gamble, it is Guerlain!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost a sober perfume, but with an fresh &amp; sorta sweet way.</li>
      <li>The first couple of hours this fragrance projects pretty well,</li>
      <li>The mid gets a bit softer with the geranium and a very clean vetiver.</li>
      <li>You should definitely try this, it&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
      <li>or so it really projects.</li>
      <li>This is not the real deal.</li>
      <li>When I sprayed it however, it was not the real mccoy.</li>
      <li>From the classic House of Guerlain; can&#x27;t miss with anything they whip up in their fragrance labs.</li>
      <li>A new must-have in my selection of fragrances.</li>
      <li>My bottle is the new one, it does not have the steel front, it is just clear.</li>
      <li>Not a very common scent, will draw compliments and inquiries.  </li>
      <li>The juice is a light green color, and it smells that way too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a minty, woody, soft type of smell.</li>
      <li>I am now ready to order my next bottle!</li>
      <li>Good for casual or formal wear.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;It sprays every time down to the last drop.&lt;br /&gt;I am constantly getting&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once it mellows down I can pull it off at work, but that first hour</li>

    <li> Probably the best perfume, I have ever used</li>
    <li> My girl loves this cologne. The only drawaback is because it is a tester so the pushbutton swivles around and is sometimes hard to see first thing in the morning.</li>
    <li> It not really as I want it .it I&#x27;d not stranger</li>
    <li> loved it, great scent, highly recommend to all men, sophisticated. I just hope it lasts longer on skin, then it would be perfect. Longevity is so-so. but love the smell</li>
    <li> Guerlain for Men Eau de Toilette has more of a citrus fragrance. I prefer that to a heavy &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; cologne.</li>
    <li> This was a blind buy gone right. After purchasing L&#x27;Instant and really enjoying the quality of a Guerlain fragrance, I was interested to see how they could do a more modern/popular take on a summer fragrance. I got to say, I really enjoy this! From the box I was already excited that it smelled like lime Kool-Aid with a good amount of sugar. But on the skin, I get so much more. From the start, I get a very nice sweet lime with some mint in the background. I can kind of detect another citrus note (maybe the bergamot), but sweet lime and mint is center stage. The mid gets a bit softer with the geranium and a very clean vetiver. The base adds a seductive element with the cedar and rum combining with the fresh and sweet mid. The first couple of hours this fragrance projects pretty well, but soon after becomes a skin scent. With this being a Woody Aromatic, I&#x27;m sure others will be able to detect this on you well after the 4 hour mark. The longevity is excellent for a citrus based fragrance (6 - 8 hours). I can&#x27;t wait to wear this when the weather gets warmer.</li>
    <li> This is not the real deal. I have used this product for years. The scent doesnt last but a few hours. Would never purchase again.</li>
    <li> Sexy, heady scent. My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> I bought this blind for the summer time. It has been awesome. A really fresh lime with mint and a touch of vetiver. Perfect for spring and summer. Definitely an outdoor scent rather than an office scent. Once it mellows down I can pull it off at work, but that first hour or so it really projects. My bottle is the new one, it does not have the steel front, it is just clear. The juice is a light green color, and it smells that way too. This blind purchase turned out to be one of my favorites. Wasn&#x27;t too much of a gamble, it is Guerlain!</li>
    <li> What an amazing earthy, floral cologne formen. This is now one of my favorites. It&#x27;s a classic for sure!</li>
    <li> Loved it. Great product!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this fragrance. She asks me to wear it often. It&#x27;s a minty, woody, soft type of smell. Good for casual or formal wear. Safe bet for a blind buy. Everybody loves it.</li>
    <li> It was a lot less in price than a department store. You should definitely try this, it&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
    <li> The perfume fades away in less than 2 hours. It smells good when I spray it but I would expect such an expensive perfume to stay longer (~8 hours). It may be a fake.</li>
    <li> I hope they keep producing this Eau De Toilette Spray.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Husband loves Vetiver and Guerlain. Perfect combo. This arrived promptly (amazon prime), the bottle is beautiful and streamlined, the scent is very fresh and not overpowering. A trademark of Guerlain. Very elegant and understated, I&#x27;ve used it and gotten compliments, when I tell my friends it&#x27;s a man&#x27;s cologne, they can&#x27;t believe it. Amazon&#x27;s price is better than any, even duty free. If you like a fresh, clean scent that doesn&#x27;t arrive before you do, or linger after you&#x27;ve gone, try this one. You can try it at most good department stores, but the best price is at Amazon. My husband travels with this as the bottle is very strong and packable and does not leak. His new favorite!</li>
    <li> I received the product and was excited to have gotten it for such a great price. When I sprayed it however, it was not the real mccoy. I will purchase from the department store from now on.</li>
    <li> A lighter fragrance, it lingers for the entire day. Powdery, very pleasant, is well suited for work or play. Not a very common scent, will draw compliments and inquiries.  A new must-have in my selection of fragrances.</li>
    <li> This has been my first Guerlain try and experience has been wonderful; its peppermint, lemon and brown sugar \\&quot;melange\\&quot; plays with your mind and feelings. This is simply fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> Smells just like it should. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;It sprays every time down to the last drop.&lt;br /&gt;I am constantly getting&lt;br /&gt;compliments from those around me as to how wonderful the scent is on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am now ready to order my next bottle!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the Guerlain perfume at the Macy&#x27;s perfume section, and I loved Guerlain Homme ever since. It&#x27;s almost a sober perfume, but with an fresh &amp; sorta sweet way. Anywho, I had to buy it cause Amazon had it much cheaper than most department stores.</li>
    <li> Vetiver gives this its appeal. From the classic House of Guerlain; can&#x27;t miss with anything they whip up in their fragrance labs.</li>
    <li> This Eau de Toilette has a clean and non aggressive scent. I hope it is not being discontinued because I could not find it in department stores in my area.</li>
