### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great for relieving itchy scalp</li>
      <li>It was a good price.  </li>
      <li>Good to try for relief.</li>
      <li>Never saw this in a store, I saw it here on Amazon (love you, Amazon) and tried it.</li>
      <li>but I am OK with that :)</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>what more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>After that it will get constantly better.</li>
      <li>tried many things to fix it but to no avail.</li>
      <li>I think so far so good for this product!</li>
      <li>All is smooth and healthy looking now for 5 weeks.</li>
      <li>I am more bothered by cheap Suave flower/cake smell than a medicinal cooling smell (I might be in the minority</li>
      <li>Try the Kirkland conditioner after using this shampoo, its surprisingly fantastic.</li>
      <li>Since my first usage of this product, my scalp has began to experience great relief from an overly sensitive and itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>My hair stays shiny and clean between washes with no shedding.  </li>
      <li>A good product that actually does help.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m itch free for the first time in years.</li>
      <li>Same as &amp;#34;original formula.&amp;#34; Nothing special about it except costs more.</li>
      <li>The price is right and the product works...</li>
      <li>years ago I used T Gel Stubborn Itch Control in the hot, humid summers of MA to cure my itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>Just want to share my experience with this shampoo, I have suffered from dandruff and dry skalp for many years but after using this shampoo, its all gone in 10-12 days</li>
      <li>only con here is that you have to use it long term to see some good effects.</li>
      <li>I like this product because it really helps just as it describes.</li>
      <li>For those who want to try, please keep in mind to try using this shampoo CONSTANTLY for at least a week or two to see the results ( I almost give up since the 3rd day but decided to carry on for a week more which i&#x27;m glad i did:))</li>
      <li>The night before you are supposed to wash your hair give your scalp and hair a good massage with almond oil mixed with a few drops of peppermint oil and sleep on it</li>
      <li>So I tried the Jason anti dandruff shampoo, tried peppermint essential oil before a wash (this is a good option because it cools the itch) which did not take care of the little white particles (again I am distinguishing between dandruff and dry scalp).</li>
      <li>I try to be as natural and organic in my choice of products as possible.</li>
      <li>I reverted back to T Gel, I used the T Gel Extra Strength, T Sal, while the former worked reasonably well</li>
      <li>Tried the usual suspects without success.</li>

    <li> Just want to share my experience with this shampoo, I have suffered from dandruff and dry skalp for many years but after using this shampoo, its all gone in 10-12 days (i used everyday without any conditioner or other shampoo) ***BUT!! Your dandruff will get even worst during first 2-3 days (and itch like hell) because the shampoo will get rid of the existing dandruff first, before prevent the reproducing of new cells. After that it will get constantly better. For those who want to try, please keep in mind to try using this shampoo CONSTANTLY for at least a week or two to see the results ( I almost give up since the 3rd day but decided to carry on for a week more which i&#x27;m glad i did:))</li>
    <li> I have used other TGel products, this is the only one for me that gets rid of the ich!</li>
    <li> Our ShiTzu&#x27;s have some skin issues. The vet said we could use this product for their baths, so we do. We see improvement.</li>
    <li> Since my first usage of this product, my scalp has began to experience great relief from an overly sensitive and itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> My mom who is 96 had an annoying problem with an itchy head.  It even kept her awake at night.  I bought this shampoo at Walmart on a closeout for her to try and it solved the problem.  It is somewhat thick but not hard to pour out and apply.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t flowery but it is acceptable and doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal.  She likes it so well we ordered two more--one for the hairdresser&#x27;s shop and one for home use.</li>
    <li> I have had an itchy scalp for years. Not so much dandruff, just an annoying itch. Tried the usual suspects without success. Never saw this in a store, I saw it here on Amazon (love you, Amazon) and tried it. It WORKS! I&#x27;m itch free for the first time in years. the smell is rather medicinal but it goes away and I&#x27;m not sitting here constantly scratching. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks and I love it. Hope it keeps working....</li>
    <li> Have used for years.  Have tried others but always comes back to this.  Helps control all symptoms of dandruff.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it really helps just as it describes. I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have tried to control a dry scalp condition through other shampoos. I researched on line and this shampoo was recommended. It has controlled the problem for me. I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> A good product that actually does help.</li>
    <li> Same as &amp;#34;original formula.&amp;#34; Nothing special about it except costs more.</li>
    <li> Nothing works like this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an itchy dry scalp (google dry scalp versus dandruff and chances are you will find out you have dry scalp not dandruff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried many things to fix it but to no avail. I try to be as natural and organic in my choice of products as possible. But not at the cost of results. So I tried the Jason anti dandruff shampoo, tried peppermint essential oil before a wash (this is a good option because it cools the itch) which did not take care of the little white particles (again I am distinguishing between dandruff and dry scalp). Basically I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair everyday. Who has time for that? Plus washing daily would strip my thick, heavy, wavy hair of moisture, not to mention daily time investment in flat ironing and styling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I reverted back to T Gel, I used the T Gel Extra Strength, T Sal, while the former worked reasonably well I craved itch relief.&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago I used T Gel Stubborn Itch Control in the hot, humid summers of MA to cure my itchy scalp. I remembered that so I went on a hunt for it at Target and Walgreens. No luck there and I found it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I credit this shampoo for changing my OUT OF CONTROL dry scalp to a manageable dry scalp and providing itch relief that lasts. I wash my hair on Sunday Night and Wednesday Night. Don&#x27;t judge. My hair stays shiny and clean between washes with no shedding.  I am usually pushing it on Saturday but I am OK with that :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell does not bother me. I am more bothered by cheap Suave flower/cake smell than a medicinal cooling smell (I might be in the minority here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con here is that you have to use it long term to see some good effects. My tips for dry scalp are:.&lt;br /&gt;(1) The night before you are supposed to wash your hair give your scalp and hair a good massage with almond oil mixed with a few drops of peppermint oil and sleep on it (cover your pillow with a towel!)&lt;br /&gt;(2) Ever so often mix this shampoo with a regular shampoo to give your hair a break and shake it up!&lt;br /&gt;(3) Try the Kirkland conditioner after using this shampoo, its surprisingly fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great for relieving itchy scalp</li>
    <li> This is the only over the counter  product I&#x27;ve found that will keep my psoriasis at bay. It was packed well and arrived without damage to any of the product containers.  The price is right and the product works...what more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo for my husband who suffers from an itchy flakey scalp.  He has tried other dandruff shampoos but claims the other brands that are a 2-1 shampoo contribute to the flakey condition.  I think so far so good for this product!</li>
    <li> The shampoo helps for scalp issues.  It was a good price.  It does have a tar odor which will sometimes come out again if you sweat in your head area.  Good to try for relief.</li>
    <li> Another add that does not work. It does cause that tingling sensation while showering, but that itch returns an hour later.</li>
    <li> Had a terribly scaly patch that wouldn&#x27;t go away. Started with a little triamcinolone cream and then followed with a regular regiment of TGel. All is smooth and healthy looking now for 5 weeks.</li>
