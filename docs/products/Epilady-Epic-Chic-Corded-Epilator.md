      <li>/&gt;This was a good choice for a beginner product I feel like-</li>

      <li>Nice packaging, timely arrival&lt;</li>
      <li>aka, I wasn&#x27;t confident in this kind of item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Honestly, though the Epilady does do a better job than the Panasonic.  </li>
      <li>Has a nice cute and sleek design.</li>
      <li>first LOL.</li>
      <li>Thank God for free return shipping!</li>
      <li>it is okay</li>
      <li>It is the cheapest product in the market for its function, but I would rather pay a bit more and get something better.</li>
      <li>I also love the shape</li>
      <li>All in all, I feel glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>When I opened the package(which is very cool), I was worried about how well this work.</li>
      <li>Comes in this neat can and the epilator itself is very cool and easy to hold.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s has a cute shape and comes with a brush to clean it after used.</li>
      <li>Very easy and powerful to use.</li>
      <li>and it is super cute.</li>
      <li>no LED light up...</li>
      <li>All that said, this would be a fantastic epilator if it weren&#x27;t for a couple of glaring flaws.  </li>
      <li>Meaning the sound from it will freak you out</li>
      <li>so it sounded magical &amp; exciting to me, but the reviews ranged from 1&#x27;s to 5&#x27;s-</li>
      <li>The new design with the pairs of tweezers works SUPER!!!</li>
      <li>However, this Epilady is much faster and the pain is virtually non-existent!!!  </li>
      <li>Ok, I was pretty scared about using one of these.</li>
      <li>But I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Also, to be fair, these issues (especially the power issue) could just be that I received a defective one.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good indicator that it&#x27;s totally tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but really it is not bad at all.</li>
      <li>but I can tell you the legs were not bad at all.</li>
      <li>Those who  want the best quality  go after the most expensive cost.</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t think that I would have very much pain even if I was a newbie!  </li>
      <li>and my legs are still just as smooth as when I first did it.</li>
      <li>For someone who has trouble getting a clean removal, this worked great.</li>
      <li>I love my new epilady.</li>
      <li>It is as easy as using an electric shaver except it lasts so much longer.</li>
      <li>I love this Epilady Epic Chic corded Epilator.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Won&#x27;t always turn on (in fact, rarely)-</li>
      <li>Of course, I&#x27;ve waxed for many years prior to using the original Braun epilator, so I am no stranger to pain while epilating.  </li>
      <li>just right and</li>
      <li>Did not work right out of the box.</li>
      <li>I couldnt bring myself to use it right then.</li>
      <li>It is working great, but I am having my doubts that it will be a long lasting product.</li>
      <li>I admit it hurt at first, but now that the hair is reduced it is a breeze.</li>
      <li>First, the Epilady doesn&#x27;t always turn on.  </li>
      <li>For now though, I&#x27;m going back to my trusty Panasonic until I can find a better option.</li>
      <li>This is such a refreshing change.</li>
      <li>I chose a corded model because they tend to last longer with more power.</li>
      <li>when I first put it on his leg.</li>
      <li>First off...</li>
      <li>This is my first time ever using an epilator of any sort.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic ES2045P epilator for a couple years now, which has been good except for a few things I was hoping the Epilady would make up for: the Panasonic runs solely on battery and cannot operate while plugged into the wall, the Panasonic has a tendency to break hairs instead of always pulling them out, and the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like.    </li>
      <li>Pretty reasonably priced as well.</li>
      <li>luckily I had an old one supply that sill worked</li>
      <li>The product inside is fine, but I probably can&#x27;t use the &#x27;can&#x27; since if I close it, it might not open again!  </li>
      <li>At first I thought it was just &#x27;cause I wasn&#x27;t used to this particular epilator, until it kept happening</li>
      <li>It is working very well on leg and underarm hair.</li>
      <li>but much easier to pay to get waxed a couple times a summer.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to everyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much money on epilator but needs to get the job done well.</li>
      <li>The cheap price equaled a short product life.  </li>
      <li>i bought this so i don&#x27;t have to shave very often.</li>
      <li>I watched 1 episode of the real housewives and it took the whole show to do both my legs.</li>
      <li>It comes in a tin case and is very compact.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t mind not being able to use it in the bath, as I typically don&#x27;t use the epilator function of my Panasonic there anyway.    </li>
      <li>This seemed to be a constant issue across many different epilators, so I was prepared for it.</li>
      <li>This seemed to be a constant issue across many different epilators, so I was prepared for it.</li>
      <li>I looked at some of the newer brands but went back to the original thats tried and true and offers a corded model with a larger head.</li>
      <li>I bought this corded epilady epilator a few months ago, and  so far I am pretty contend and satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Epilady Original for at least 20 years with fantastic results.  </li>
      <li>Comes in a little cute container and travel pouch.</li>
      <li>After much study, I decided to buy the Epic Chic Epilator.  </li>
      <li>Also, sometimes the spinning mechanism gets hot and you will have to wait 5 minutes for it to cool down.  </li>
      <li>be prepared to buy a new power supply after you purchase and receive unit.  </li>
      <li>but, this new design removes all but a couple.</li>
      <li>The jury is out as to whether it is better than shaving my legs, because it takes much longer than shaving (at least at this point).</li>
      <li>My only complaints are that it won&#x27;t turn on when I hit the On button every time and I wish it didn&#x27;t take so many run-overs (over a few days) to get smooth, but, it beats shaving every single day for now.</li>
      <li>Is time consuming because it takes several days in a row, consistently, to get a \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; hair-free type leg</li>
      <li>I give this product 4 stars only instead of 5 just because of the cheap price which I don&#x27;t associate with long duration.</li>
      <li>the sound scared me half to death.</li>
      <li>The product seemed fine at first, but sometimes it would not turn on due to a loose connection in the cord.</li>
      <li>It plugged along with sporadic starts and stops for another 5 months, before completely dying.</li>
      <li>sensation- it feels and looks like you shaved with a crappy old razor head afterwards, too.</li>
      <li>about 2 days after you knew you needed to change it because it&#x27;s old.</li>
      <li>The travel one is still going since purchase in the early 1980&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>And if it weren&#x27;t for the power issue, I might even forgive the heating issue (all you&#x27;d have to do is turn it off and let it cool down for a couple minutes before continuing).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using the Epilady Original for at least 20 years with fantastic results.  It finally stopped working.  After much study, I decided to buy the Epic Chic Epilator.  I love it!  It&#x27;s much smaller but works just as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! I owned the original epilady design in both a small travel size and the larger 3 speed rechargeable. The travel one is still going since purchase in the early 1980&#x27;s. My rechargeable finally gave out and would not recharge or start when just plugged in. So, I went looking again for a hair remover that could tackle the problem of my coarse and hard to remove facial hair. I chose a corded model because they tend to last longer with more power. The small inconvenience of a nonrechargeable is easily accepted when up against power that will last over time. The new design with the pairs of tweezers works SUPER!!! For someone who has trouble getting a clean removal, this worked great. I always have to tweeze the  last stubborn hairs no matter what but, this new design removes all but a couple. This is such a refreshing change. As time has gone by my hair has gotten thicker and coarser and couldn&#x27;t even be removed with the strongest Nair type product. Shaving (which leaves terrible stubble and is back by night) and tweezing (which is more time consuming) just aren&#x27;t as accetable an alternative to the Epilady Chic. Once you have become accustomed to the tweezing action you don&#x27;t even feel the twinges as the hair is pulled, even on the upper lip. It is as easy as using an electric shaver except it lasts so much longer. For my fast growing facial hair I can go a week between touch ups, and my legs several weeks between removal. I looked at some of the newer brands but went back to the original thats tried and true and offers a corded model with a larger head. Plus it is less expensive than the fancier models.</li>
    <li> the power supplies are bad on these units.  be prepared to buy a new power supply after you purchase and receive unit.  luckily I had an old one supply that sill worked</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Very easy and powerful to use. Has a nice cute and sleek design. Comes in a little cute container and travel pouch. This is my first time ever using an epilator of any sort. Just very pleased with this product. I would definitely recommend this to my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this item and have used it twice now. It is working great, but I am having my doubts that it will be a long lasting product. I hope I am wrong on this one, because I really like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic ES2045P epilator for a couple years now, which has been good except for a few things I was hoping the Epilady would make up for: the Panasonic runs solely on battery and cannot operate while plugged into the wall, the Panasonic has a tendency to break hairs instead of always pulling them out, and the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like.    Well, the Epilady does resolve all of those issues.  I also love the shape-it&#x27;s a little less awkward than my Panasonic.  I don&#x27;t mind being tethered to a power cord, as the cord is sufficiently long.  I also don&#x27;t mind not being able to use it in the bath, as I typically don&#x27;t use the epilator function of my Panasonic there anyway.    All that said, this would be a fantastic epilator if it weren&#x27;t for a couple of glaring flaws.  First, the Epilady doesn&#x27;t always turn on.  There have been several times when I&#x27;ve had to press the power button multiple times before it does anything.  There have also been a few times where I&#x27;ve given up trying to get it to work and come back at a later time to see if it&#x27;ll cooperate then.  The other flaw is that the tweezer discs start to get hot before I&#x27;m even done with one leg, which gives a not-so-fantastic burning sensation.  At first I thought it was just &#x27;cause I wasn&#x27;t used to this particular epilator, until it kept happening and I turned the thing off and felt the heat on the discs.    Honestly, though the Epilady does do a better job than the Panasonic.  And if it weren&#x27;t for the power issue, I might even forgive the heating issue (all you&#x27;d have to do is turn it off and let it cool down for a couple minutes before continuing).  Also, to be fair, these issues (especially the power issue) could just be that I received a defective one.  For now though, I&#x27;m going back to my trusty Panasonic until I can find a better option.</li>
    <li> i bought this so i don&#x27;t have to shave very often. i gave up on using it on my arm pits and legs. i only use it for my bikini line. it is okay but much easier to pay to get waxed a couple times a summer.</li>
    <li> I bought this corded epilady epilator a few months ago, and  so far I am pretty contend and satisfied with it. It works at the level I expected. For 30 bucks is very good. Those who  want the best quality  go after the most expensive cost. Just like some of the reviews before mine,I guess you&#x27;ll get what you paid for.But I hope it will last long enough. I give this product 4 stars only instead of 5 just because of the cheap price which I don&#x27;t associate with long duration. However,I hope it will endure for  a while.At least that is what it shows so far. All in all, I feel glad I bought it. I would recommend it to everyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much money on epilator but needs to get the job done well.According to the pain it causes, it is not bigger than any other epilator.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package(which is very cool), I was worried about how well this work. But I was not disappointed. It is working very well on leg and underarm hair. I recommend. Pretty reasonably priced as well.</li>
    <li> Ok, I was pretty scared about using one of these. I watched some youtube people using them and it didn&#x27;t look nice. Well I got this package and it is super cute. Comes in this neat can and the epilator itself is very cool and easy to hold. Soooo I turned it on and AHHHHHHH the sound scared me half to death. I couldnt bring myself to use it right then. When my husband got home from work I made him let me do a part of his leg first LOL. He is alot worse on pain then I am. Of course he let out a scream (just to scare me) when I first put it on his leg. LOL He said it wasn&#x27;t bad. So I got up the nerve to try it. Let me tell you the bark is alot worse then the bite. Meaning the sound from it will freak you out but really it is not bad at all. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 is it does take a little bit of time to do both legs. I watched 1 episode of the real housewives and it took the whole show to do both my legs. BUT on the other hand. It has been 5 days since I have used it and my legs are still just as smooth as when I first did it. SOOOO I will take that over shaving any day. I have been to scared to try it anywhere else at this time. but I can tell you the legs were not bad at all. Very happy I got it and tried it. This is a great one!!</li>
    <li> I read review after review on all the different brands and types and sizes and... I hadn&#x27;t ever tried this so it sounded magical &amp; exciting to me, but the reviews ranged from 1&#x27;s to 5&#x27;s- aka, I wasn&#x27;t confident in this kind of item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Nice packaging, timely arrival&lt;br /&gt;- Very nice style and easy to hold, seemed \\&quot;natural\\&quot; to use&lt;br /&gt;- Plug in cord is long&lt;br /&gt;- Is not where NEAR as terrifying as some of the pain oriented horror stories I read&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Won&#x27;t always turn on (in fact, rarely)- This is why it would get a two, but all epilators seemed to be moody per reviewers&lt;br /&gt;- Is time consuming because it takes several days in a row, consistently, to get a \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; hair-free type leg&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t always pull the hairs out, it cuts about 50% of them \\&quot;short\\&quot; on each go around&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those afraid of pain- (I&#x27;ll admit, I was nervous myself), this product doesn&#x27;t hurt bad- no squeals or bearing down to \\&quot;take it.\\&quot; I&#x27;m covered in tattoos &amp; one reviewer said it was similar to getting a tattoo- PFF no way!! These best way to describe the sensation (and I went buck wild, using it all over my leg areas in a constant motion, going over areas repeatedly, ect) is that it feels like your shaving razor about 2 days after you knew you needed to change it because it&#x27;s old. It&#x27;s that sort of annoying, scratchy/burn sensation- it feels and looks like you shaved with a crappy old razor head afterwards, too. Definitely something anyone can handle. YES- there ARE a few areas that are sensitive, like the lowest part of my ankles, around the knees... but duh, that&#x27;s sensitive even if you just scratch an itch. Using an epilator isn&#x27;t scary. If a zillion people were using these things, reviewing them, and have also been using them for years and years- it&#x27;s a good indicator that it&#x27;s totally tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a good choice for a beginner product I feel like- it wasn&#x27;t too expensive, but it wasn&#x27;t a piece of crap either. But, like lots of people say, this item is ridiculously moody &amp; turns on when it feels like IT wants to turn on. This seemed to be a constant issue across many different epilators, so I was prepared for it. But, when it DOES turn on, it can go for a quite a long while with constant use without heating up or smelling bad like some people experience with epilators. My only complaints are that it won&#x27;t turn on when I hit the On button every time and I wish it didn&#x27;t take so many run-overs (over a few days) to get smooth, but, it beats shaving every single day for now.ke lots of people say, this item is ridiculously moody &amp; turns on when it feels like IT wants to turn on.

    <li> I used to have a Remington epilator which lasted 5 years and did a great job, but they discontinued the model.  The Epilady Epic Chic didn&#x27;t even last a year. I began having problems with the start button after about 6 months. It plugged along with sporadic starts and stops for another 5 months, before completely dying. The cheap price equaled a short product life.  In the realm of hair removal, I would say it was average.  Nothing great, at times it would miss hairs or break them off. The round design was not always easy to hold, but for the price I was willing to put up with a little inconvenience.  The problem is less than a year later I&#x27;m purchasing another epilator (not an Epilady). So my initial savings has now turned into a bigger expense.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work upon arrival, returned 10/28 - still waiting on replacement as of 11/17/11.   Plugged in but wouldn&#x27;t take a charge.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s has a cute shape and comes with a brush to clean it after used. It comes in a tin can and a cloth bag, so storage is not a problem.</li>
    <li> this product didn&#x27;t work when it arrived and was missing the cleaning brush.  It was returned to amazon with no hassles.</li>
    <li> If you have never used an epilator, and want to try it, this is a good product because it is inexpensive without sacrificing functionality.  Epilating does NOT feel like waxing and I do recommend trying it before investing in a $75 product.  This was a good option for that purpose.  As mentioned by the other reviews, it is certainly &#x27;low end.&#x27;  If when you plug it in the blades do not spin, try unplugging it and then rotating them a little by hand.  Also, sometimes the spinning mechanism gets hot and you will have to wait 5 minutes for it to cool down.  Two small tricks (mentioned in a few of these reviews) are that you have to get the 120 degree angle just right and sometimes moving the device in a small circular motion will help the blades catch the hairs. However, after a little practice, it removes hair very well and is very compact.</li>
    <li> I like that this is not battery operated (I hate having to replace or recharge batteries all the time).  I have no problem with the cord as it is long enough.  Haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product yet.</li>
    <li> I had used the Braun epilator for approximately 15 years when it finally bit the dust.  I looked long and hard and read MANY reviews until I found this little Epilady Chic on sale.  I decided to give it a try and I am REALLY impressed!!  I have very little hair remaining on my legs, so even with my old one, it didn&#x27;t take that long.  However, this Epilady is much faster and the pain is virtually non-existent!!!  Of course, I&#x27;ve waxed for many years prior to using the original Braun epilator, so I am no stranger to pain while epilating.  However, I don&#x27;t think that I would have very much pain even if I was a newbie!  I love this Epilady Epic Chic corded Epilator.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Hey Amazon. you might want to check the description - it describes a rechargeable wet/dry shaver while this is a corded epilator, and if you check ASIN B0000BVOSS, it shows a picture of the shaver with a description of an epilator.  I haven&#x27;t bought it yet, but it forced me to rate it, so I picked 1 star.  According to the woman I spoke with in customer service, this was your only mechanism to alert you to a possible problem like this...</li>
    <li> Did not work right out of the box. Just got it today and plugged it in...nothing...no LED light up...no motor movement. It&#x27;s broken! Going back to Amazon! Thank God for free return shipping! I did give it two stars only because I&#x27;m giving it the benefit of the doubt and I&#x27;m thinking I just got a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I love my new epilady. I admit it hurt at first, but now that the hair is reduced it is a breeze. The jury is out as to whether it is better than shaving my legs, because it takes much longer than shaving (at least at this point). That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;It is essential in my bikini area where I can&#x27;t shave without leaving ingrown hairs and big red bumps. Yuck!</li>
    <li> It is the cheapest product in the market for its function, but I would rather pay a bit more and get something better. It is slow, gets hot with use and eventually even stops working if overheat. Check for Brawn. That&#x27;s my advice.</li>
    <li> First off...Amazon advertises this as a Corded Epilator..yet the description tells us: Built-in rechargeable batteries offer 45 minutes shaving time!!! Now that is not available with the corded model!!! Secondly I received mine with a dented holder.  It comes in a &#x27;can&#x27; and when I got mine the dent made it so I could not easily open it.  The product inside is fine, but I probably can&#x27;t use the &#x27;can&#x27; since if I close it, it might not open again!  I put that in the comments about the packaging..but who knows if anyone reads those or will get back to me on it!!</li>
    <li> best thing since cotton candy.  It works so well, with little pain.  I have gotten them for myself, daughter &amp; daughter-in-law.</li>
    <li> The product seemed fine at first, but sometimes it would not turn on due to a loose connection in the cord. I tried to contact the seller for an exchange, but he never responded. Poor customer service.</li>
    <li> It is quite small so it is very hard to hold. It comes in a tin case and is very compact.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, therefore, I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
