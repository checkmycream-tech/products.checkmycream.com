      <li>You press the top to dispense and out comes just enough into the palm of your hand.</li>

      <li>it before I blow dry my hair to keep the friz down on my fine hair and it works great.  </li>

      <li>Has a very calming scent and leaves my hair soft and slightly shiny.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy or coated, because the product itself isn&#x27;t a very heavy paste like most leave-ins.</li>

<li> This product actually made my hair feel dry</li>
<li> One of these bottles can last me from 3 - 4 months if I&#x27;m careful.</li>
<li> I use it on eet and dry hair.</li>
<li> I tried other, cheaper products, but they made my hair feel and look oily.</li>
<li> Depending where you get it, MILK&#x27;s price typically ranges from $25-46 US dollars, I got mine for about $26, but the quality matches the price in this case.</li>
<li> The smell on my bottle was very faint and dissipated right after I put it on my hair.</li>
<li> I add water to it to make it less heavy.</li>
<li> A little expensive but a tiny bit goes a long way with my shoulder length hair.</li>
<li> A little too herbal scented @</li>
<li> When I applied it to my damp hair, I immediately felt a difference through each swipe through a handful of strands (my hair is a little longer than shoulder-length).</li>
<li> It really bugs me when a product dispenses way too much into your hand even at the slightest touch, it&#x27;s a terrible waste of money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure about the reviews stating this has a &amp;#34;strong smell&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not completely sure if it is color-safe, but I haven&#x27;t seen any signs of my hair color fading, either.</li>
<li> It comes in a sleek, hard, glassy case with a cap that stays in place on the nozzle.</li>
<li> This product works so well on my curly dull hair!  </li>
<li> If you have thick hair, trust me, do not buy!  </li>
<li> My husband has very thick, curly hair.</li>
<li> I will probably continue to use it, unless it becomes ridiculously expensive.</li>

    <li> This stuff is amazing. Smells great, makes air dried hair look finished. First time I bought it from an overpriced salon, so I thought I&#x27;d never see it again unless beamed down from the heavens. So happy to find it on Amazon.</li>

    <li> This stuff is worth every penny! It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> This product smells fantastic with so many herbal, subtle undertones.  It is rich and luxurious, and the scent works for a man or a woman. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my hard to manage hair.  A friend of mine got this at her hairdressers and told me about it, and I found it here on Amazon.  This is a mainstay on my dresser an I use it on eet and dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love this MILK hair product.  I us it before I blow dry my hair to keep the friz down on my fine hair and it works great.  I also absolutely love the smell of MILK.</li>
    <li> It keeps my fine hair soft and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down . My hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and overtime it makes them healthy . Definitely recommended!! The seller customer service is great . Its definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love it. I add water to it to make it less heavy.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended at my salon and I have been using it for about 6 months. I have very fine hair that often appeared a little dry, even with great conditioners. This product is amazing and helps with breakage and keeping my hair moisturized and healthy, but without being heavy or oily. Everyone I know has commented on how healthy my hair looks, even without knowing that I had been using this product. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great if you need a light holdn smell is d o amazing that I would love it even if it did nothing but smell good.</li>
    <li> I had a hair stylist introduce me to this and love getting it on the net. Save so much money. Use it constantly as I am very outdoors person and have highlighted hair. Just a couple pumps all you need at a time.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have never been to Garret Markenson Coiffure, but I&#x27;ve been looking for an organic color-safe leave-in treatment. I&#x27;m not completely sure if it is color-safe, but I haven&#x27;t seen any signs of my hair color fading, either. Depending where you get it, MILK&#x27;s price typically ranges from $25-46 US dollars, I got mine for about $26, but the quality matches the price in this case. It comes in a sleek, hard, glassy case with a cap that stays in place on the nozzle. You press the top to dispense and out comes just enough into the palm of your hand. It really bugs me when a product dispenses way too much into your hand even at the slightest touch, it&#x27;s a terrible waste of money. I&#x27;m also in love with the texture of the product. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy or coated, because the product itself isn&#x27;t a very heavy paste like most leave-ins. It feels watery/slippery, but without drip, so it evenly distributes just enough on your hands. When I applied it to my damp hair, I immediately felt a difference through each swipe through a handful of strands (my hair is a little longer than shoulder-length).</li>
    <li> Great service. Great product. Keeps my hair straight without heaviness. Wish I had found this product years ago.</li>
    <li> A little too herbal scented @ first but I have really gotten used to it and now I love the scent &amp; how nice it makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price! Especially with Amazon Prime and no shipping!</li>
    <li> This product tames my unruly hair and keeps the fizz away in hot, humid Texas.</li>
    <li> I sincerely love this stuff. I&#x27;m not sure about the reviews stating this has a &amp;#34;strong smell&amp;#34;. The smell on my bottle was very faint and dissipated right after I put it on my hair. I will say that every person I&#x27;ve had smell it smells something different. My husband smells flowers, I smell an herbal &amp;#34;lush&amp;#34; like scent, and a friend smells lemon verbena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair but lots of it. My fine hair tends to get dry and a bit frizzy on the ends. This solves that problem for me and gives it a mirror like shine. My husband has very thick, curly hair. This product does wonders for his hair especially in humidity. It helps his curl to lay in a cleaner more defined manner without frizzing plus it&#x27;s adds shine. I&#x27;m hooked on this line. I&#x27;ve also tried the conditioner from this line and would recommend it as well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I actually know the person who invented this and go to the Salon, but because it is so popular and they sell out, I had to purchase it here.  The price is comparable and delivery was fast.  I can&#x27;t imagine not having this product for my hair, it makes it so soft and silky, I really noticed a difference when I ran out and couldn&#x27;t get it at the Salon.  It doesn&#x27;t just coat your hair, it actually provides nourishment, and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> Love this! Has a very calming scent and leaves my hair soft and slightly shiny. A little expensive but a tiny bit goes a long way with my shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I believe it is a good product, but the fragrance is unappealing and is too strong.  My fault for ordering a hair product without being able to smell it first.</li>
    <li> This product works so well on my curly dull hair!  It now feels and looks silky.  Best of all it is completely organic.  I would recommend this to any and everyone.</li>
    <li> Got it within 3 days.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy at all, and it tames my hair&lt;br /&gt;and makes brushing easy during the day. Perfect for my thick&lt;br /&gt;color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, though the price keeps going up. I tried other, cheaper products, but they made my hair feel and look oily. I only use a little of this on my bangs and the top of my head, where my hair seems to need it. One of these bottles can last me from 3 - 4 months if I&#x27;m careful. I will probably continue to use it, unless it becomes ridiculously expensive. And personally, I LOVE the way it smells, too!</li>
    <li> Great product, shipped fast</li>
    <li> I truly do not understand these reviews.  I have long thick hair that tends to be frizzy most of the time.  This product actually made my hair feel dry AND it was frizzier after I applied it.  I tried it 3 times and it did not work!  There are way better anti-frizz smoothing creams and oils on the market.  Perhaps it is geared towards people with fine hair as it seemed to add volume and frizz to my hair.  If you have thick hair, trust me, do not buy!  It will not work!</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair and this product was recommended to me by my hair stylist. It helps tame the frizziness and smells great. I would recommend for all hair types.</li>
    <li> Love it! It leaves your hair so soft and silky. Plus, it smells great!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Just awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> The first 3 ingredients listed are water, behentrimonium methosulfate, and cetearyl alcohol even though the product is advertised as containing all natural, organic products. The scent is a masculine, musky smell.</li>
