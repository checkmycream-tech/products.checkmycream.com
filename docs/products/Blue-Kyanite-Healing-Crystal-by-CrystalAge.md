    <li> I can see from others&#x27; reviews they are not exaggerating about chinsy sizes or quality, but I just wanted to say my experience was great, and I think a much better deal than many other kyanite sources. I ordered them on two ocassions, I think two each time. The second time I was confused, because the first time my kyanite pieces were awesomely gigantic! The second they were not, but when I realized how gorgeous and transparent the second smaller set was I was elated and grateful to not get big (but still beautiful) ones again &#x3D;)</li>
