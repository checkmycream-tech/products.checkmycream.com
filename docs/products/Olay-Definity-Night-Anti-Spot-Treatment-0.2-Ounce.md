### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but would also say that the packaging is 2-star at best.  </li>
      <li>I was very impressed.</li>
      <li>Loves it and uses it every day and made a great difference.</li>
      <li>The price is good if you&#x27;re reluctant to spend a lot.</li>
      <li>I never tried the Olay Spot treatment, but I truly love Olay products and feel that if I use my tip with the Olay, problem solved!    </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Amazing product .</li>
      <li>I honestly thought I received someone else&#x27;s used &amp; returned product.</li>
      <li>So far very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>This is so far the best spot corrector ever.</li>
      <li>got much better results from 7 signs serum that I can no longer find.</li>
      <li>I will try one more  tube.  </li>
      <li>Just in and out like we all do, but I swear something more keeps them brown besides  the sun.</li>
      <li>I am really glad it works for some people, I just wish I was one of them.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t going to shell out more $ to finish the 6 weeks they say it takes for results.    </li>
      <li>I use Olay products and am generally satisfied, but this product is an exception.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, and I already see some changes in the color shading of my age spots.  </li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t been pregnant in 18 years.</li>
      <li>I am trying this product because Olay usually gets very good reviews through Consumer Reports.  </li>
      <li>New is not always better.</li>
      <li>but there was not 6 weeks worth of treatment in the tube</li>
      <li>If anyone has tried a product that really works on brown spots please comment on my post and tell me what it is!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a REAL chore!</li>
      <li>The applicator is funky and he even cut the tube at the bottom to see if there was more product when he felt like it was getting low.</li>
      <li>After that, if there isn&#x27;t a better result I will not go for a third one.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I am willing to give the product</li>
      <li>but unfortunately it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a waste of good product and consumer&#x27;s</li>
      <li>It does take 3-4 weeks to really notice a difference but the brown spots on my nose and above my eyebrows did fade away and hands did disappear completely by week 6, and its been 6 months and no sign of returning and not to mention I look 10 years younger everyone says.feeling great now.</li>
      <li>He was highly motivated to use it consistently and noticed results after having used it for about a month.  </li>
      <li>Nothing really worked.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be more gentle than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>Unlike the other reviewer&#x27;s husband who was able to cut the tube, I don&#x27;t have a tool that I could use for that.</li>
      <li>I was not as satisfied as I have been with their other products.</li>
      <li>There was nothing in the wording to indicate that my original post had been read, and it is possible that this was an automatic response.  </li>
      <li>These spots were a source of embarrassment for him as he is very trim and fit and these spots, he felt, aged him.  </li>
      <li>I like the older version.</li>
      <li>I have used Olay products for almost two decades and have always been happy, this is my first disappointment with one of their products.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s only worth about a dollar.</li>
      <li>I contacted Olay and received a \\&quot;thanks for the email\\&quot; reply which repeated the same instructions from the packaging (very UNhelpful) and offered a coupon for another Olay product.  </li>
      <li>Despite all the tapping I&#x27;ve done, I&#x27;m sure there is still a little of the serum left inside the tube ...</li>
      <li>it have become very irritated, red and a bit sensitive.</li>
      <li>As the old adage goes with weight gain/loss, I didn&#x27;t get my brown spots overnight</li>
      <li>So far this product seems to working without the usual skin irritation that I&#x27;ve experienced in the past.</li>
      <li>Rotate all over face in soft circular motions for approx.</li>
      <li>While it didn&#x27;t completely erase all of his spots, it faded them dramatically.  </li>
      <li>When you insert the applicator into the product container and pull it out, there is a miniscule amount of product on the inside of the applicator, not enough to wick out when you touch it to your skin, and there is NONE on the outside, thanks to a plastic ring which \\&quot;squee-gees\\&quot; off any product that might be adhering to the outer surface.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for a more dramatic reaction.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent way more with little or no results on other products.</li>
      <li>a little longer try if only because I DO notice some positive</li>
      <li>I do not normally have sensitive skin so this result came as a big surprise.</li>

<li> Do not waste your money on this or the other Olay Definity products.  </li>
<li> Olay really needs to work on their packaging waste!</li>
<li> Tried lots of different creams, cheap and expensive.</li>

<li> so that, by the time you get to the last, maybe, quarter of the product, you would have to tap the bottle hard against a wall or countertop to get the serum from the bottom to adhere to wall of the tube, after which you&#x27;d need to wiggle the wand back and forth just to grab some serum.</li>
<li> The packaging has NO instructions on using the applicator, only a few lines about using it nightly; the rest of the packaging is promises about the miraculous results.  </li>
<li> Most of the creams were usually expensive and irritating to my skin.</li>

<li> There is some credance to the other reviewer&#x27;s complaint about the poorly designed stick, although that is not my main gripe.</li>
<li> The substance has no smell and is slightly sticky.    </li>
<li> I had after pimple dark spots in few areas on my cheeks after using the spot corrector all dark spots gone in 4 weeks.</li>
<li> For over 10 years I have tried both prescription and over the counter \\&quot;fade creams\\&quot; with little or no success.</li>
<li> I am a big fan of the Definity Intense Hydrating Cream &amp; Night Restorative Cream but was extremely disappointed in this Spot Treatment.    </li>
<li> Pen size package has so little product</li>
<li> After massaging your face, leave the sour cream on your face for 15 minutes and then rinse!    </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t have to wear heavy make up to cover trouble areas .</li>
<li> 1 teaspoon sour cream  4 drops of juice from a lemon    Mix with fork on small plate  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few days now and the spots where I have applied</li>
<li> There is very little product in the tube.</li>
<li> Very little in the container, and very little results.</li>
<li> The packaging is 3x the weight of this product (if not more).    </li>
<li> My biggest complaint is that the tube is made of hard plastic (have some environmental conscience, P&amp;G!)</li>
<li> it resent and still not happy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read the other reviews and most complained about the poor design of the handle, so I was prepared for that to be a problem.  What I wasn&#x27;t prepared for is that the product does NOTHING.  I have been using it on a dark spot on my face every night and there is no change.  I even switched over to the entire Olay Definity facial line, hoping it would help to minimize the spot, but it doesn&#x27;t.  Do not waste your money on this or the other Olay Definity products.  I have used Olay products for almost two decades and have always been happy, this is my first disappointment with one of their products.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night for a month, but it does not remove spots from my face.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Definity Intense Hydrating Cream &amp; Night Restorative Cream but was extremely disappointed in this Spot Treatment.    There is very little product in the tube. I honestly thought I received someone else&#x27;s used &amp; returned product. I noticed -no- fading in pigmentation but there was not 6 weeks worth of treatment in the tube and I wasn&#x27;t going to shell out more $ to finish the 6 weeks they say it takes for results.    The substance has no smell and is slightly sticky.    Olay really needs to work on their packaging waste! The packaging is 3x the weight of this product (if not more).    If anyone has tried a product that really works on brown spots please comment on my post and tell me what it is! I am only 45 but have been getting brown patches on my skin in the last couple of years. It looks like a pregnancy mask but I haven&#x27;t been pregnant in 18 years. I wear zinc oxide on my face daily for protection, but the sun just makes them darker.</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t do anything, have used it on three age spots for about a month with no results. got much better results from 7 signs serum that I can no longer find. Product Packageing is also terrible. Pen size package has so little product it&#x27;s only worth about a dollar. DON\\&quot;T BUY.</li>
    <li> Very little in the container, and very little results. Difficult to apply with applicator. Had to have  it resent and still not happy.</li>
    <li> I tried this product reluctantly, not having confidence anything could reduce or eliminate age spots. I was very impressed. It does not eliminate the age spots but it does reduce them to the point that makeup actually covers them. I&#x27;m a believer in this product!</li>
    <li> I am trying this product because Olay usually gets very good reviews through Consumer Reports.  My three spots that I am working on appear lighter.  I was hoping for a more dramatic reaction.  I will try one more  tube.  After that, if there isn&#x27;t a better result I will not go for a third one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to rate the product 5-star but would also say that the packaging is 2-star at best.  I have gone through one tube and have seen a couple of spots progressively shrinking in diameter. As the old adage goes with weight gain/loss, I didn&#x27;t get my brown spots overnight so I don&#x27;t expect them to disappear with just one tube of use either. Therefore, I am willing to give the product a little longer try if only because I DO notice some positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the tube-n-wand design is terrible. There is some credance to the other reviewer&#x27;s complaint about the poorly designed stick, although that is not my main gripe. My biggest complaint is that the tube is made of hard plastic (have some environmental conscience, P&amp;G!) so that, by the time you get to the last, maybe, quarter of the product, you would have to tap the bottle hard against a wall or countertop to get the serum from the bottom to adhere to wall of the tube, after which you&#x27;d need to wiggle the wand back and forth just to grab some serum. It&#x27;s a REAL chore! Unlike the other reviewer&#x27;s husband who was able to cut the tube, I don&#x27;t have a tool that I could use for that. Despite all the tapping I&#x27;ve done, I&#x27;m sure there is still a little of the serum left inside the tube ... I just can&#x27;t get to it. It&#x27;s a waste of good product and consumer&#x27;s money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see re-design of the packaging, perhaps to a regular squeezeable tube like that of the Olay Pro-X discoloration concentrate (which I have not tried using).</li>
    <li> I never tried the Olay Spot treatment, but I truly love Olay products and feel that if I use my tip with the Olay, problem solved!    For face skin discoloration    1 teaspoon sour cream  4 drops of juice from a lemon    Mix with fork on small plate  Rotate all over face in soft circular motions for approx. 10 min.    Apply in the am and pm before bedtime.  After massaging your face, leave the sour cream on your face for 15 minutes and then rinse!    You will start seeing results in a week.  And your skin will glow!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 47, had my 3rd (and last) child 4 years ago and started to notice several age spots on my face. Tried lots of different creams, cheap and expensive. Nothing really worked. Saw this product and gave it a try. I don&#x27;t use it every night, but after about 2 months I did start to notice some of the spots had faded a bit. I&#x27;m going on the 4th month of use and can say this product works, but it&#x27;s not the miracle cure I had hoped for. The price is good if you&#x27;re reluctant to spend a lot. I&#x27;ve spent way more with little or no results on other products.</li>
    <li> For over 10 years I have tried both prescription and over the counter \\&quot;fade creams\\&quot; with little or no success. Most of the creams were usually expensive and irritating to my skin. But after using the Olay Definity Night Anti-Spot Treatment for about a month I saw a big improvement on my darkest age spots. So far this product seems to working without the usual skin irritation that I&#x27;ve experienced in the past. And the price can&#x27;t be beat for its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I must have really bad spots because this did nothing for me. I have been using it for over 3 months EVERY nite with no results. The sad thing is I don&#x27;t get in the sun. Just in and out like we all do, but I swear something more keeps them brown besides  the sun. I also wish I could find something to get rid of them besides surgery. Why can&#x27;t some company come up with what would get rid of them because we all are different and what works for one won&#x27;t work for another. I am really glad it works for some people, I just wish I was one of them. Will keep searching tho.</li>
    <li> I use Olay products and am generally satisfied, but this product is an exception.  Frankly, I can&#x27;t tell if it works because I can&#x27;t get the applicator to work.  The applicator is a cheap, thin, plastic tube - think coffee stirrer - attached to a handle.  When you insert the applicator into the product container and pull it out, there is a miniscule amount of product on the inside of the applicator, not enough to wick out when you touch it to your skin, and there is NONE on the outside, thanks to a plastic ring which \\&quot;squee-gees\\&quot; off any product that might be adhering to the outer surface.  Ergo, there is no way to get the stuff onto your spots.  The packaging has NO instructions on using the applicator, only a few lines about using it nightly; the rest of the packaging is promises about the miraculous results.  I contacted Olay and received a \\&quot;thanks for the email\\&quot; reply which repeated the same instructions from the packaging (very UNhelpful) and offered a coupon for another Olay product.  There was nothing in the wording to indicate that my original post had been read, and it is possible that this was an automatic response.  My recommendation: don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> I purchased this anti-spot treatment for my husband, who has lots of brown spots on his forehead at age 47.  He was highly motivated to use it consistently and noticed results after having used it for about a month.  While it didn&#x27;t completely erase all of his spots, it faded them dramatically.  These spots were a source of embarrassment for him as he is very trim and fit and these spots, he felt, aged him.  The applicator is funky and he even cut the tube at the bottom to see if there was more product when he felt like it was getting low. There was enough for another week&#x27;s application.</li>
    <li> it says it takes about six weeks.  will let you know then.  i keep putting it on and keep hoping.  i hate age spots.  soooooo ugly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few days now and the spots where I have applied it have become very irritated, red and a bit sensitive. I thought this would be more gentle than other products I&#x27;ve tried but unfortunately it&#x27;s not. I do not normally have sensitive skin so this result came as a big surprise.</li>
    <li> It does take 3-4 weeks to really notice a difference but the brown spots on my nose and above my eyebrows did fade away and hands did disappear completely by week 6, and its been 6 months and no sign of returning and not to mention I look 10 years younger everyone says.feeling great now.</li>
    <li> This is so far the best spot corrector ever. People don&#x27;t know about it . They end up spending many on very expensive products. I had after pimple dark spots in few areas on my cheeks after using the spot corrector all dark spots gone in 4 weeks. You can&#x27;t even see where they were. Amazing product . My face looks even toned . Don&#x27;t have to wear heavy make up to cover trouble areas . Love it!</li>
    <li> I was not as satisfied as I have been with their other products. New is not always better. I like the older version.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and I already see some changes in the color shading of my age spots.  So far very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Ordered for a family member to try it out.  Loves it and uses it every day and made a great difference.</li>
