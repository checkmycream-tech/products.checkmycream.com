    <li> These are great. The seller got them to me quickly and they were just what I wanted!  I just wished I purchased more of them!</li>
    <li> These are great for eye shadow</li>
    <li> Really do like these applicators!!</li>
    <li> Had researched for awhile for these simple makeup applicators. I have been using one for a month now and it has no signs of breaking apart yet like the little sponge applicators you get with eyeshadows. I like the longer length and colors and quality is good so far for me.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for longer applicators in the stores locally.  Since I couldn&#x27;t find any, I chose to look online.  These looked perfect and at a good price.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them five stars is that I would like them even a little longer. The price was great for the number you get and free shipping.  They are soft and now my eye shadow doesn&#x27;t flake onto my cheekbones as it does with a brush.  Would buy again after I use them up.</li>
    <li> These are awesome.  I love them.</li>
    <li> Very attractive and nice product</li>
    <li> These surprised me.  All of sudden a little packet arrived in the mail from HongKong and this was it.  I like the different colors and the length.  They&#x27;re sturdy and can be reused several times.</li>
    <li> These have been Working Great.. something to use when applying my eyeshadow! &amp; what a Cheap price!!</li>
    <li> A little rough on the eyelids and doesn&#x27;t pick up much of the shadow to apply</li>
    <li> Product is as described</li>
    <li> Pretty great and they&#x27;re high quality</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t find these in the store for some reason.  These are good quality at a great price.  It&#x27;s worth the wait for the shipping time.</li>
    <li> These are better than I expexted for the price!</li>
    <li> Work great- seem very durable!</li>
    <li> I bought these a few weeks ago, and have already went through a whole pack.  The foam tops fall off only after 2 to 3 uses.  They are made poorly.</li>
    <li> LOVE these! They took a little while to arrive but it doesn&#x27;t matter. They are worth the wait. So much better than any eye makeup applicators you can buy at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Didnt apply eye shadow very well. The handles are cute but I ended up throwing them out cuz it doesn&#x27;t apply eye shadow evenly. I use top brand eye shadows that have fabulous pigmentation, but these applicators apply the eye shadow very pale, like eye shadow they&#x27;d sell in the toy section at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I love the longer length and they blend my eyeshadow perfectly.</li>
