<li> I ordered a hot pink and white bag.</li>
<li> I feel that is a ridiculously long time to wait for a purchase.</li>
<li> I never would have ordered it if I knew it was going to take that long to get to me.</li>
<li> , just wish it was a little bigger!</li>
<li> The bag arrived on time but was a  little smaller than i expected, but still qw</li>
<li> I wish the bottom of the bag (second pouch) should have a carton or something hard that will support the upper pouch.</li>
<li> And for the price, the size is about what I expected.</li>
<li> I received a black and dark pink bag.</li>
<li> this was bought to give as a gift and who wants to give a gift that has a terrible smell and needs to be washed first?</li>
<li> This little thing can hold a lot of stuff, believe me.</li>
<li> I think those would not fit for this bag</li>
<li> The material is quite stiff and the zippers stick.  </li>
<li> I thought it would be small after all the reviews I read</li>
<li> it was too small...</li>
<li> you have excessive makeup that you travel with you</li>
<li> this is much small than i had hoped</li>
<li> just 2 weeks delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;I am not thrilled with it</li>
<li> It is so cheap and I am horribly unimpressed.</li>
<li> I mean if you got a lot of it</li>
<li> This bag was broken as soon as I opened it.</li>
<li> for 6$ how can you go wrong?</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m really confused as to why my experience was so bad.</li>
<li> But I am really unhappy with the product.</li>
<li> I thought I would like the stacking but find it inconvenient.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m highly disappointed.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
<li> Horrible customer service.  </li>
<li> Terrible smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I thought it would be small after all the reviews I read but it works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> SO CUTE! And for the price, the size is about what I expected. Ordered for a Christmas present for my daughter. Filled the bottom with LOTS of nail polish. Was able to fit some lip glosses, nail files, nail polish remover and some cotton balls in the top compartment. It&#x27;s very well made, and just ADORABLE! My daughter will LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be bigger. Still cute though.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this purchase. I ordered a hot pink and white bag. I received a black and dark pink bag. Also the material feels very cheap. The mirror in the top part was also shattered when I opened it for the first time. I&#x27;m highly disappointed. I guess it&#x27;s true when they say, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Cute and functional. Although the brush pockets don&#x27;t actually hold the brushes in very well.</li>
    <li> This seemed to come slow in the mail--not as fast as alot of items I order--but it is really cute and I am happy with the product itself--barely made it for Christmas though</li>
    <li> Love this bag it&#x27;s cute and holds all my make up and lipsticks. I&#x27;m planning  to order 1 for my nail polish stuff next. Can&#x27;t wait to see it in another color</li>
    <li> I received this cute little bag in the amount of time they said i would receive it. It is wonderfully made and compact but holds all of my cosmetics. I do not use a lot of cosmetics, but it holds my lipstick, brushes and eye shadow and pencils. it has an upper and lower compartment with a mirror. I recommend this product for your carry on makeup bag for home or travel.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.I recommend this product it is very very useful.I really like the bright color pink. This product met my expectations.👌</li>
    <li> love the duel compartments. only flaw it is not so sturdey so its always collapsing i tried to put cardbord on the sides but i havent figured out how to hold it in place as it falls two. but i do love it. for 6$ how can you go wrong?</li>
    <li> this is much small than i had hoped</li>
    <li> Cute bag.  For some reason I was expecting it to be bigger but I probably misjudged the size.</li>
    <li> I like this bag. Only thing i don&#x27;t like is the fact that it&#x27;s flimsy and foldable. It has no rigidity to it at all.&lt;br /&gt;Fits a lot of stuff though.</li>
    <li> I got this bag a few weeks ago and absolutely love it. It is larger than I thought but its definitely a good thing.</li>
    <li> I like the item this helps me organize my make up. For those who have different make ups, brushes etc. I mean if you got a lot of it I think those would not fit for this bag but as for me everything USB just in  place. I love the color too. The reason i only have 4 stars instead of 5 is that it doesn&#x27;t stand up on its own I wish the bottom of the bag (second pouch) should have a carton or something hard that will support the upper pouch. But still I like it coz the reason I bought it is to organize my make up.</li>
    <li> For the money, its a good deal</li>
    <li> I like this, just wish it was a little bigger! It does match my suitcase too.</li>
    <li> The bag arrived on time but was a  little smaller than i expected, but still qw</li>
    <li> This is cute and very hand with the two compartments.</li>
    <li> good size, great color</li>
    <li> The material is very flimsy so it cannot support a large amount of makeup. My brushes fall out consistently. Get a better quality bag if you have even a medium amount of makeup</li>
    <li> Cool bag, she liked it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as big as I need it to be.if you travel light this bag can be perfect for you.if you have excessive makeup that you travel with you may want something different.</li>
    <li> Cute bag...much smaller than I had anticipated. It doesn&#x27;t even fit my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This came more quickly than I expected...just 2 weeks delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;I am not thrilled with it but you get what you pay for.  It is way too tall for my use of it.  The color is true and it is a pretty pink. The material is quite stiff and the zippers stick.  I thought I would like the stacking but find it inconvenient.  I gave it a try and luckily didn&#x27;t spend much for it.  It will go in my goodwill box and I will check out the more costly ones.</li>
    <li> I use it for all my 1 year olds accessories. Good portable storage and cute!</li>
    <li> Ok so when I got this in the mail I tough it was too small...there is no way I&#x27;m going to be able to fit all of my make up in here. Ummmmm.... Yes it will! This little thing can hold a lot of stuff, believe me. It&#x27;s cute, &amp;#34;little&amp;#34;, but holds a lot. Love it!</li>
    <li> Was dissapointed..looked to be bigger and brighter color. Not what I was hoping for, but price was inexpensive so not out a lot. Thank you. Mary L.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a Christmas present about 5 weeks ago and have yet to receive it. It wasn&#x27;t until after I clicked the purchase button that it said it may take 6-8 weeks to arrive. I feel that is a ridiculously long time to wait for a purchase. I never would have ordered it if I knew it was going to take that long to get to me.</li>
    <li> Lost of space in the bag.  It&#x27;s a very cheap vinyl (as would be expected from the low price).  The mirror is an unexpected bonus.  I used it for about 3-4 months and it worked just fine.</li>
    <li> I wish I could put zero stars. This bag was broken as soon as I opened it. The zippers were disconnected and the handle wasn&#x27;t on. It is so cheap and I am horribly unimpressed. The other reviews are great so I&#x27;m really confused as to why my experience was so bad. But I am really unhappy with the product.</li>
    <li> Terrible smell. There is no way this is usable. Horrible customer service.  Was told I should wash it with shower jell and hang it out I the sun. #1 I shouldn&#x27;t have to wash a brand new item. #2 this was bought to give as a gift and who wants to give a gift that has a terrible smell and needs to be washed first? #3 this company wants me to pay return shipping to China!! Still trying to get my money back and pre paid shipping label.</li>
