      <li>it&#x27;s perfect if the strap can only be longer...</li>
      <li>and it fit fine.so I took a star away because of</li>
      <li>cheaply made.</li>
      <li>the shoulder strap is not suited to fit over an adults shoulder that I can see unless your strap is longer.</li>
      <li>Thought that I would love this product...did for about 3 days then the main zipper broke!  </li>
      <li>I love the fact you can see through them and they are very well made.</li>
      <li>I tested this bag I put two bottles in this one full size shampoo and one full size conditioner</li>
      <li>I had this bag for just a couple months and the whole thing ripped on the top.</li>
      <li>For the price not bad though..</li>
      <li>, that I&#x27;ve been able to keep the bathroom organized by using these clear bags.</li>

      <li>prefer the rectangular shaped tote - height is just right and holds a lot of product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its a nice size and has the long carrying strap if I ever need to take it if I travel.</li>
      <li>I like the clear because you can easily see what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I place all the loose travel-sized items in the interior side pocket &amp; amazingly everything stay in it despite it not being zippered.</li>
      <li>zipper broke the first day I used it</li>
      <li>I use as notebook,  to put make up in, hold vitamins bottles and RX bottle to keep in one place, us for first aid kit.use one for hair products etc</li>
      <li>I made first aid kits for upstairs, downstairs and the car.  </li>
      <li>amazing with two messy teens</li>
      <li>It was not sewed very well.</li>
      <li>Originally got this bag for sporting events, wanted the strap for a friend who likes those types of cross body bags.</li>
      <li>not sure how full she filled it</li>
      <li>one &amp; this clear carry all makes all of them useable as I please!</li>
      <li>This bag is nice and big to put all my make up and other items I use on a daily basis instead of shoving them all in the bottomless pit</li>
      <li>The NFL came up with this new rule of clear purses...</li>
      <li>The zipper feels a little cheap</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s clear</li>
      <li>These are just what they appear to be, Clear.</li>
      <li>and i noticed it wasn&#x27;t sewed together completely on the bottom.</li>
      <li>As far as the shoulder  </li>
      <li>OK for a few uses, but they wont last long.</li>
      <li>use the smaller clear cosmetic bag for my purse</li>
      <li>I bought 3 clear bags in different shapes to see which one I would prefer.  </li>
      <li>.Still be careful if your letting your child  use this because the strap could very well be a choking hazard.</li>
      <li>The clear totes (I ordered two) not only appear much smaller coming out of the box.</li>
      <li>I cut the large strap off - not useful.</li>
      <li>Bag is clear which I prefer, but it is not very sturdy plastic</li>

<li> so I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
<li> They have extra zippered pockets than I expected.</li>
<li> this was not what i expected.</li>
<li> Yes, I&#x27;ve purchase a few different bags searching for the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;</li>
<li> And the strap barely goes around my shoulders, and I&#x27;m quite small.</li>

<li> i thought the strap was going to be longer other than that i like it..</li>

<li> so I don&#x27;t set it down and forget it.  </li>
<li> There is a half pocket on</li>
<li> this is my new purse for game day!</li>
<li> Not worth the money I paid!  </li>

<li> it&#x27;s still in tact after a few days away.</li>
<li> the only bad thing is the zipper broke...</li>
<li> it&#x27;s useless unless you have a small child who uses this</li>
<li> All of the stitching is extremely weak and does not hold this product.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not even fixable :(</li>
<li> disappointed</li>
<li> I hate wasting my money.</li>
<li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <li> I just used this bag and i noticed it wasn&#x27;t sewed together completely on the bottom. It was need for work and now I need a better bag stronger I hate wasting my money. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> The clear totes (I ordered two) not only appear much smaller coming out of the box. Once unfolded, you&#x27;ll find the measurements of the bags about an inch smaller</li>
    <li> These are just what they appear to be, Clear. I love the fact you can see through them and they are very well made. They have extra zippered pockets than I expected. Good buy.</li>
    <li> zipper broke the first day I used it</li>
    <li> Thought that I would love this product...did for about 3 days then the main zipper broke!  Not worth the money I paid!  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This bag is nice and big to put all my make up and other items I use on a daily basis instead of shoving them all in the bottomless pit I call my purse. It&#x27;s nice that&#x27;s it&#x27;s clear so I can see what I&#x27;m grabbing.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 clear bags in different shapes to see which one I would prefer.  I made first aid kits for upstairs, downstairs and the car.  I like the clear because you can easily see what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the smaller clear cosmetic bag for my purse so I don&#x27;t have to dig around and can spot the shade of lipstick I need quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the rectangular shaped tote - height is just right and holds a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing with two messy teens, that I&#x27;ve been able to keep the bathroom organized by using these clear bags. WooHoo!</li>
    <li> i thought the strap was going to be longer other than that i like it..</li>
    <li> Owned this product for a couple months now. I use it for my diaper bag(s). I place all the things I need for changing my baby&#x27;s diaper in here except the actual changing pad. Since it&#x27;s clear I can easily see everything &amp; grab quickly as needed. I place all the loose travel-sized items in the interior side pocket &amp; amazingly everything stay in it despite it not being zippered. This product also makes switching diaper bags easy! Yes, I&#x27;ve purchase a few different bags searching for the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; one &amp; this clear carry all makes all of them useable as I please!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this to use for my nephew and neice to keep their art supplies in. Will work perfectly! There is a half pocket on the inside which I didn&#x27;t know when I bought it. The zipper feels a little cheap but we&#x27;ll see if it holds up to kids. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> This bag serves the purpose for what I needed it for . honestly I can&#x27;t  complain for the price yes it is smaller than what you see in the picture but I can fit more than enough in this without over loading it,I have not had any problem with the zipper it&#x27;s still in tact after a few days away.As far as the shoulder  strap it&#x27;s useless unless you have a small child who uses this .Still be careful if your letting your child  use this because the strap could very well be a choking hazard. This can be cut off however I left mine on to hang over a Bathroom door at the hotel I was staying at.Almost for to mention this,also has a zippered inside pocket too.when I tested this bag I put two bottles in this one full size shampoo and one full size conditioner and it fit fine.so I took a star away because of the shoulder strap is not suited to fit over an adults shoulder that I can see unless your strap is longer.</li>
    <li> Thicker than a ziploc freezer bag, but not a lot.  OK for a few uses, but they wont last long.</li>
    <li> Bag is clear which I prefer, but it is not very sturdy plastic so I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long. I cut the large strap off - not useful. The zipper pull was missing when I received but I kept the bag ONLY because I was traveling the next day and needed it. Would not buy again unless I knew it was sturdier plastic.</li>
    <li> this tote is the perfect size, shoulder strap very handy.  the only disappointment zipper broke first week.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift but it was a good size. Also it has a pocket inside which comes in handy... has handles or strap so either way its workable... took a week to come in.  the only bad thing is the zipper broke...not sure how full she filled it but just a heads up...For the price not bad though..</li>
    <li> this was not what i expected. cheaply made. It was not sewed very well. Probaly will not last long. disappointed</li>
    <li> Originally got this bag for sporting events, wanted the strap for a friend who likes those types of cross body bags. Seems a lot smaller than it looks. And the strap barely goes around my shoulders, and I&#x27;m quite small. But I guess it will do the job for now.</li>
    <li> Zipper broke 2 days later</li>
    <li> I bought it to carry around my ipad at work so I don&#x27;t set it down and forget it.  I wear the shoulder strap across my chest and put my ipad in it.  The only critique I have is since I put it across my chest, the shoulder strap could be longer, especially for someone larger than a size medium if they wanted to use it for the same purpose.</li>
    <li> I just received this item yesterday. I wanted a nice big bag for all of my cosmetics. Its a nice size and has the long carrying strap if I ever need to take it if I travel.</li>
    <li> The NFL came up with this new rule of clear purses... well you gotta do what you gotta do, so this is my new purse for game day!</li>
    <li> After one hour of use, the zipper came apart from the seams.  All of the stitching is extremely weak and does not hold this product. together.</li>
    <li> IT HAS LOTS OF ROOM EVEN THOUGH IT WAS WELL UNDER THE LARGEST ACCEPTABLE  SIZE THE NFL WILL ALLOW. I SEE NO NEED FOR ONE ANY BIGGER.</li>
    <li> I had this bag for just a couple months and the whole thing ripped on the top. It&#x27;s not even fixable :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I was disappointed in the strap not being long enough for carrying it cross body. I don&#x27;t think I can recommend this product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s perfect if the strap can only be longer... I love this product since the company required us to have clear bags and I just go in and out the employee entrance without security peeking inside...</li>
    <li> I use this for everything.  I have 10. I use as notebook,  to put make up in, hold vitamins bottles and RX bottle to keep in one place, us for first aid kit.use one for hair products etc</li>
    <li> Very handy bag for travel and storage. Good size. Great for storing anything that needs to be seen (so you don&#x27;t have to rummage to find what you&#x27;re looking for).</li>
    <li> ripped after a few days</li>
    <li> Too small to be of use for anything other than a Kids coloring book carry all that barely has room for a few crayons or markers.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Xmas gift. My friend is happy so if she loves it then I&#x27;m happy. Seams and zippers look top quality.</li>
