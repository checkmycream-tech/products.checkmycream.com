      <li>Nice colors</li>

      <li>I have to be honest.</li>
      <li>The glosses are nice as well.  </li>
      <li>But color-wise and strictly by appearances I would say they look like a nice product, hence the 4 stars.</li>
      <li>Great pigment, fun colors!</li>
      <li>very light colors, stain your skin tastes</li>
      <li>The glosses are lighter than the lipsticks which i love about them.</li>
      <li>The lipstick is nice, smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>I love the color choices.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the lipsticks and even bought the liner.</li>
      <li>The lipgloss is stunning .</li>
      <li>The hues are stunning do yourself a favor get it you will not regret purchasing this lipsticks set.</li>
      <li>Too many reds.</li>
      <li>I love the way the colors look on me and you can go matte or glossy or both.</li>
      <li>If they had 20 more colors ,I would buy them.  </li>
      <li>i love it ..</li>
      <li>The colors were pretty and they smell really good</li>
      <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!</li>
      <li>Wow what a great cosmetic product.</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying how rich the colors are i just love them.</li>
      <li>the lipstick breaks easily.</li>
      <li>These are my absolute favorite!</li>
      <li>smooth and generous but colors are gaudy</li>
      <li>Cheaply made and gloss and lipstick broke apart.</li>
      <li>but they are cheap lipsticks.</li>
      <li>, there are two lips gloss lipstick in one, this is very useful.</li>
      <li>Appears to be more of a higher end product</li>
      <li>Overall good product.</li>
      <li>I love the 2-in-1 which gives you the ability to be bright or just everyday!</li>
      <li>i must say this is by far one of my favorite purchases</li>
      <li>I thought it was pretty cool to have a dual end lipstick/lip gloss in one product for a cheaper price</li>
      <li>so the neon pink color and the bright red were a bit too bold for my taste.</li>
      <li>So I think it can be long-lasting in color, not so much of the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>THanks</li>
      <li>for the price this product is better than expected.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful colors lipstick is smooth and creamy not sure how long they will last</li>
      <li>Apparently, the lipstick size is larger than the packaging because when I opened the lipstick, the top was smudged to the lid.</li>
      <li>The colors are fantastic, long wearing and natural in appearance.</li>
      <li>The lip gloss is pretty much standard.</li>
      <li>I received colors from the second picture which I exactly wanted.</li>
      <li>I recieved mine today and both of my pinks were smashed nd comming out of the top so it not only was all over the other 4 but also got all over my hands!</li>
      <li>The colors are too bold compared to the picture and there are two kinds of each color except one is shimmer and the other matte.</li>
      <li>Hooker red &amp; hot hot pink.</li>
      <li>Weird smell and taste.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are good but who cares...</li>
      <li>Nice &amp; long lasting but kind of ugly colors.</li>
      <li>I am usually hesitant to buy makeup online unless its a product I&#x27;m familiar with.</li>

<li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as the name says but can&#x27;t complain for what you pay for</li>
<li> AS IT SAYS IT DOES.. NOT EVEN AN HOUR LONG LASTING.</li>
<li> IT  SAID LONG LASTING</li>
<li> But it doesn&#x27;t seem to be long lasting.</li>
<li> Lucious &amp; long lasting.  </li>
<li> but you guys sent me the same colors just one is sparkle and the other is not</li>
<li> seems to make the lips very dry....</li>
<li> I did test one of the products and wiped it away roughly to take it off</li>
<li> Absolutely not the colors shown.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that the lipgloss tastes a little chemical-like.</li>
<li> but feels a little heavy on my lips.</li>
<li> This stuff is not smooth</li>
<li> This is the very first time I&#x27;ve bought lipstick and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
<li> 2 of my lipsticks came broken off into the cap, and the gloss is a little oily for my taste.</li>
<li> colors are horrible and look cheap</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick and shiny.</li>
<li> but that wasn&#x27;t enough for me to get mad over.</li>
<li> So needless to say, I intend on returning this product as it was not worth the purchase.</li>
<li> The packaging was poor.</li>
<li> but this failed for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I am really disappointed...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> very light colors, stain your skin tastes yucky.but doesn&#x27;t stay on lips, smears and tastes yucky. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow what a great cosmetic product. The colors are fantastic, long wearing and natural in appearance. The value one gets for the price is perfect.</li>
    <li> great product for the value</li>
    <li> loooovvvvee it ! i don&#x27;t feel the need to buy more lipsticks , great work</li>
    <li> smooth and generous but colors are gaudy</li>
    <li> The colors were pretty and they smell really good but they are cheap lipsticks. The color does not stay on one bit. Good for a picture or something temporary. Went to a dinner party and took the lipstick off in the restroom when I saw the tables set with wine glasses. Didn&#x27;t want the embarrassment of having lipstick come off all over the glass.</li>
    <li> OMG, I was so impressed by the pigment of the lipstick.  The glosses are nice as well.  I was pleased with all the colors and they look great on my medium brown skin tone.  I will order again!</li>
    <li> I love the way the colors look on me and you can go matte or glossy or both.</li>
    <li> for the price this product is better than expected.  Gorgeous colors, feels good on lips, no taste or odor.  Appears to be more of a higher end product</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and gloss and lipstick broke apart. Plus too bright of colors.</li>
    <li> Only one of the colors matched my skin tone...</li>
    <li> I like it, it&#x27;s very good but you guys sent me the same colors just one is sparkle and the other is not I think that&#x27;s a rip off</li>
    <li> Too many reds. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest. I was looking forward to this product. I am usually hesitant to buy makeup online unless its a product I&#x27;m familiar with. But I didn&#x27;t want to spend $20 per lipstick. I thought it was pretty cool to have a dual end lipstick/lip gloss in one product for a cheaper price but this failed for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, some pros. The lipstick is nice, smooth and creamy. The lip gloss is pretty much standard. I did test one of the products and wiped it away roughly to take it off but some color remained. So I think it can be long-lasting in color, not so much of the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the cons. The packaging was poor. Apparently, the lipstick size is larger than the packaging because when I opened the lipstick, the top was smudged to the lid. The colors are too bold compared to the picture and there are two kinds of each color except one is shimmer and the other matte. I&#x27;m not fair-skinned so the neon pink color and the bright red were a bit too bold for my taste. So needless to say, I intend on returning this product as it was not worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice and cheaper this set, there are two lips gloss lipstick in one, this is very useful. I recomended.</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are awesome, very smooth and colors can be worn alone or I put the goldfish ones over my darker shades...would purchase them again...price is great as well.</li>
    <li> I recieved mine today and both of my pinks were smashed nd comming out of the top so it not only was all over the other 4 but also got all over my hands! I gave it 2 stars because I still like my red!</li>
    <li> I love it. It came well packaged and just in 48 hours. The quality is very great and what is important the smell of the product is very nice also. The lipstick is creamy and stays on all day. The lipgloss is stunning . It&#x27;s thick and shiny. I received colors from the second picture which I exactly wanted. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Weird smell and taste.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are good but who cares...I am really disappointed...&lt;br /&gt;Removed it immediately after trying it on.</li>
    <li> Felt smooth and went on beautifully, even smelled great. Just didn&#x27;t like the colors on me.</li>
    <li> seems to make the lips very dry....colors are great - cheap -</li>
    <li> Love the lipsticks!! Great colors!! Lucious &amp; long lasting.  A great buy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is not smooth</li>
    <li> These are my absolute favorite! I love the 2-in-1 which gives you the ability to be bright or just everyday! Will definitely be buying these again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely not the colors shown. I got 2 red, 2 neutrals, and 2 pinks. I was expecting warmer colors, this was a waist.&lt;br /&gt;FYI the lipstick breaks easily.</li>
    <li> Im a makeup artist and i must say this is by far one of my favorite purchases, so far, The colors are perfect, there bright, creamy and  with the gloss it gives it the shine that you may want or just the lipstick for the matte look! ITS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are a gift, and I haven&#x27;t given them yet, so I don&#x27;t know quality-wise how they measure up. But color-wise and strictly by appearances I would say they look like a nice product, hence the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I love the lipsticks and even bought the liner. Great pigment, fun colors! My only complaint is that the lipgloss tastes a little chemical-like.</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; long lasting but kind of ugly colors. Hooker red &amp; hot hot pink. Nice gloss too except for the colors</li>
    <li> colors are horrible and look cheap</li>
    <li> IT  SAID LONG LASTING BUT  AS IT SAYS IT DOES.. NOT EVEN AN HOUR LONG LASTING. I REALLY LOVED THE COLORS</li>
    <li> I will be buying this again and again for gifts...etc...i love it ..i get compliments</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as the name says but can&#x27;t complain for what you pay for</li>
    <li> Overall good product. 2 of my lipsticks came broken off into the cap, and the gloss is a little oily for my taste. But overall they get the job done.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors lipstick is smooth and creamy not sure how long they will last but im satisfied with my purchase and price is great</li>
    <li> I love the color choices.  But it doesn&#x27;t seem to be long lasting.</li>
    <li> These lipsticks and glosses are amazing! Let me start by saying how rich the colors are i just love them. The pigment of the lipsticks is just amazing,they are so moist and cover in just one stroke. The glosses are lighter than the lipsticks which i love about them. If i feel i just want a ligjt sheen on my lips the glosses do the job. tthough when i recieved my package the heads of all the lipsticks were a bit smashed but that wasn&#x27;t enough for me to get mad over. They are perfect i just love them!</li>
    <li> I like the variety of all the colors.</li>
    <li> Every person that works with makeup must have this lipstick set.  the colors are AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!   If they had 20 more colors ,I would buy them.  This is the very first time I&#x27;ve bought lipstick and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  I bet thousands of you, have had the same dissapointment and never put the lipstick you bought on or you gave it away.  Each one of these colors is beautiful. The hues are stunning do yourself a favor get it you will not regret purchasing this lipsticks set. I Guarantee  them 100%  P.s this seller in my opinion has the best lipstick set and price out there. THanks</li>
    <li> Nice creamy texture and beautiful colors!</li>
    <li> Nice colors but feels a little heavy on my lips.</li>
