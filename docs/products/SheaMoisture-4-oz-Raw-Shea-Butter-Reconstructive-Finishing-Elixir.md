      <li>when I was returning Shea Moisture&#x27;s Hold &amp; Shine Moisturizing spritz, because it did none of those things for my hair, this very sweet girl there took me over to the hair aisle to tell me how wonderful she found the Organix Penetrating Serum to be.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>Works so well and the hair feels so nice.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and does not overpower.</li>
      <li>It smelled nice though,</li>
      <li>so this oil is appealing appearance wise.</li>
      <li>In the sea of products out there, this is awesome and NATURAL!  </li>
      <li>It did a pretty good job and kept my hair smelling good.</li>
      <li>If you have very fine hair, or hair that tends to be greasy</li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love it!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than It&#x27;s a 10, Pantene, argan oil, and every detangling product I&#x27;ve tried (which is A TON).</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Just love anything by SheaMoisture.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>There are better products.</li>
      <li>Smells great, really does what it says it will.</li>
      <li>Now how much better</li>
      <li>It takes away any tangles better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT.</li>
      <li>My husband noticed when I switched and says I smell great and my hair looks so much healthier.</li>
      <li>Love this item.</li>
      <li>Even though this product didn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m glad that I found this brand</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t initially in love with the price [either online or in store]but</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It went much better.  </li>
      <li>I love these produces.</li>
      <li>Any more</li>
      <li>Makes them smooth and glistening and sexy.</li>
      <li>my hair is smooth and shine :)</li>
      <li>After I rinse the conditioner, I spritz the elixir on damp hair and whew, the fragrance is strong as all get out.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this works for me.</li>
      <li>The smell is fine ....</li>
      <li>This did NOT make my hair greasy, however I guess if you have fine hair then it will make your hair greasy.</li>
      <li>This oil works fine on</li>
      <li>I was literally light headed after I applied this elixir on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I will also use nightly, with a light spritz all over, before putting on my bonnet.</li>
      <li>Use after blow drying to smooth flyaways from breakage.</li>
      <li>So far,  my hair is in good condition, I just need to trim my ends.      </li>
      <li>Leaves hair super smooth and not as tangled.</li>
      <li>When I wear it straight, I like my hair to bounce and be very light.</li>
      <li>by the next morning it has absorbed and hair is detangled, soft, oiled but not greasy, sooo manageable and best of all hair</li>
      <li>I took off a star because the fragrance can be bit overwhelming at times and there is a learning curve on how much to apply this elixir to the hair.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.</li>
      <li>the thing is the fragrance is so strong and intense that it may not be comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount, and your hair will be silky, shiny, light, bouncy, etc...</li>
      <li>I love it and recommend it highly :</li>
      <li>Great for sealing moisture into Black hair.  </li>
      <li>If you have coarse, dry, damaged hair this elixir is EXCELLENT for transforming and taming your hair.</li>
      <li>I find best results when&#x27;s  applied to damp hair, NOT dry nor WET.  </li>
      <li>However I won&#x27;t be recommending this to any natural friends, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>I use as a sealing oil on freshly washed hair overtop of my leave in conditioner (done in twists or braids</li>
      <li>It arrived a day prior to the scheduled delivery date which was a nice surprise.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair shiny, soft, tangle free, and frizz free.</li>
      <li>My hair looks clean and shiny and the product is much lighter than the heavier oils</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other oils that I have had very good results with (mixed chicks and Ion glosser)</li>
      <li>Actually, the second and even the third day, my hair still looked great and even better than the first day.</li>
      <li>I even like that it&#x27;s called an elixir because that&#x27;s exactly what it was for me.</li>
      <li>I think this would work more effectively on a different hair texture.</li>
      <li>works really great for thick curly hair and does not leave your hair greasy.</li>
      <li>If you have never had oil on your hair, it may feel somewhat oily at first, but it does dissipate and you will still notice a difference.</li>
      <li>She Moisture really got it right with this one</li>
      <li>in fact it still looked really dry and fly away in certain places so an hour later</li>
      <li>Honestly this maybe the ONLY Achilles heel to be found in this entire line and because their other products are so good...</li>
      <li>Based on my experience with this oil and a different moroccan oil I tried, I really think these \\&quot;true oils\\&quot;  are best for natural hair and or really thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>and it was a bit much for my hair.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping though.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really judge the efficacy yet</li>
      <li>A couple of mixes to cover my whole head</li>
      <li>It really is an elixir.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST MOISTURIZING RE-CONSTRUCTOR I&#x27;VE EVER USED    I REPAIR &amp; SHINE SPRAY (SOFTENED MY HAIR, BUT IS A PROTIEN)</li>
    <li> Just love anything by SheaMoisture. This product leaves my hair shiny but not loaded down with the weight of an oil. Great product .</li>
    <li> I think overall this product is... good... the thing is the fragrance is so strong and intense that it may not be comfortable to wear. It really smells like the body spray I used to buy from walmart when I was a little girl (really cheap and overpowering). It also seems to sit on my hair. But it gets the job done as far as adding moisture. Honestly this maybe the ONLY Achilles heel to be found in this entire line and because their other products are so good... I will cont. to use this. However I won&#x27;t be recommending this to any natural friends, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Since I have recently gone natural. I spent so much money on products that did not stand by what it was required to do. Shea Moisture products are the TRUTH. It does what it says it will do. I have been using this product for approximately three months and I love it. It leaves my hair very soft with no breakage when attempting to comb through my thick mane. I am very pleased with Shea Moisture and will defintely support this product.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product at my local Target since I was curious about this product.  It claims to strengthen hair from the roots and protects hair from damage.  In time I have used it, I haven&#x27;t noticed any of those but then again I only used it in a short time period so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a complete 180 in my hair.  So far,  my hair is in good condition, I just need to trim my ends.      There aren&#x27;t any specific instructions on the bottle on how to use this product, but if you go to the Shea Moisture website, they have a *.pdf file on it.  Here is what it says: After styling, spray evenly into hair to seal the cuticle as well as add sheen, hydration and shine. May be used on wet hair only if hair is going to be  air dried, not heat styled. Hair may be styled after thoroughly dry.      I used the accompanying shampoo and conditioner from the same line.  After I rinse the conditioner, I spritz the elixir on damp hair and whew, the fragrance is strong as all get out.  I was literally light headed after I applied this elixir on my hair.  I ended with a weird headache and decided to sleep it off.  My hair was shiny and greasy but apparently I used too much.  So a spray here and there goes a long way.  Next time I used it on dry hair that was cleaned.  It went much better.  I only spray like twice and it was a bit much for my hair.  Granted my hair is very porous so it can absorb moisture but cannot retain it.  But what I learned is that I have to spray this product in my hand and rub it on the ends of my hair.  I took off a star because the fragrance can be bit overwhelming at times and there is a learning curve on how much to apply this elixir to the hair.  I would not recommend this for fine or relaxed hair because it is heavy.  Plus a little goes a long way so do not go overboard.      Ingredients:  Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Oil*, Argan  Oil, Vegetable Squalene, Carrot Oil, Macadamia  Nut Oil, Isopropyl Myristate, Avocado Oil, Castor  Oil, Sebacic Acid, SeaKelp Extract, Essential Oil  Blend, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower  (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle)  Flower Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E). *Denotes  Certified Organic Ingredient.</li>
    <li> Adds a wonderful sheen and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I am Black with long hair.  It is not too heavy.  Perfect for adding at night to moisturize or as a finishing spritz.</li>
    <li> Best product for moisturizing oil.  I use this as an alternative to Moroccan oil</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  A little dab will do ha just right!</li>
    <li> Works so well and the hair feels so nice. The smell is nice and does not overpower. If you have never had oil on your hair, it may feel somewhat oily at first, but it does dissipate and you will still notice a difference. Give it a try and decide for yourself.</li>
    <li> great moisture for women of colour who have coily hair. You do not need to use it with any other moisture product.  The smell is fine .... however, everyone is different when it comes to aroma preference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a week and already has improved the health of my hair. Less breakage, less shedding, and more elasticity. Important: a little goes a long way. If your hair is on the thin or fine side, try only one or two light sprays arms length distance away. Or spray one spray into hands and work through starting at the ends. On the day I plan to wash my hair, for an extra boost of conditioning, I spray a few sprays, more than normal, really hitting every strand of hair, letting it sit for an hour or two then shower and wash it out. Leaves hair super smooth and not as tangled. I have also used this on my legs believe it or not. Makes them smooth and glistening and sexy. I really love this stuff. Oh be careful with the residue settling on the tile floor. It will make the floor slippery. Found that out the hard way! Stand on rug or lay down a towel.</li>
    <li> *The blend of restorative and beneficial oils/extracts will leave your hair feeling pampered. *I find that whether or not I use a considerable amount,my hair has a sheen to it.Not all oils even leave any sign of shine(oddly enough) so this oil is appealing appearance wise. *The smell is very pleasing to me.I think it&#x27;s the honeysuckle. But by no means is it overpowering so thumbs up for that. *This oil works fine on it&#x27;s own but it also enhances the effectiveness of deep conditioners.Experimenting with this oil has yielded good results. I wasn&#x27;t initially in love with the price [either online or in store]but this 4 oz product has lasted me several months so I think it&#x27;s worth it to splurge a bit on an all natural,decent product such as this one.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love it!  This product and everything made by this company is fabulous!!!  I color my hair alot and it needs all the help it can get and this product makes it baby soft and shinny without being greasy!</li>
    <li> I like the product, however it was leaking in the package.  I am not sure if the company did not tighten the top or not.  But I continue to use the remainder of the product.  I like Shea Moisturizer products.</li>
    <li> I brought this because I was looking for a lite and natural shine product for my hair.  I wanted an all natural product but this product has isopropyl, which is a type of alcohol. It flaked my hair and made it itchy. It smelled nice though,</li>
    <li> Just tried this today.  They are absolutely correct when they say a little goes a long way, HOWEVER, it didn&#x27;t go far enough!  My hair didn&#x27;t really look any different after the first application- in fact it still looked really dry and fly away in certain places so an hour later I added a little more-- big mistake.  The second application was clearly too much- then I seemed to have an oily feeling on my hands if I touched my hair and even on my forehead.  I ended up having to wash my hair again because the \\&quot;oily\\&quot; feeling was so intense.  I&#x27;ve used other oils that I have had very good results with (mixed chicks and Ion glosser) so guess I&#x27;ll go back to one of those.  Based on my experience with this oil and a different moroccan oil I tried, I really think these \\&quot;true oils\\&quot;  are best for natural hair and or really thick hair.  I&#x27;ll stick with the other types of glossers that are  blended with a few other ingredients.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way when applied to damp/dry hair to tame frizz and enhance curls.&lt;br /&gt;Love the fragrance too!&lt;br /&gt;There is always a bottle on my shelf.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine blonde hair.  This is too heavy for day use, but I put it on my hair at night and wash it out the next morning.  It seems to be helping my over-processed, damaged hair after a week of use.</li>
    <li> Amazing moisture! Hair feels very soft and much easier to brush through. best hair oil I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
    <li> leave your hair way to oily.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair off and went natural. I bought this along with some other products to help retain moisture while getting my hair healthy. It arrived a day prior to the scheduled delivery date which was a nice surprise. It has a slight musky scent which is fine with me but in addition to other products it might be a little overwhelming for some, I don&#x27;t mind it. For now I am going to use this as a leave in for my wash and go&#x27;s. I can&#x27;t really judge the efficacy yet but it is not greasy or oily. I will update my review when I&#x27;ve used it for a longer period, that is the reason for the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair moist and not too oily .</li>
    <li> It is definitely not my go to product. It does tame fly aways but that is the only use I give it. This is quite heavy if you have very straight hair like I do. I think this would work more effectively on a different hair texture. It weighs mine way too much. So I just use the tiniest bit every now and then for those pesky hairs. Wouldn&#x27;t reputchase though. There are better products. Fast shipping though.</li>
    <li> I would buy again I love it</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, wavy, frizzy blonde horse hair that I&#x27;ve had trouble taming for years. Moisturizing conditioners etc were  either greasy or made the frizz worse. This stuff works. I will say this though: USE IT SPARINGLY!! I have a lot of hair (to my waist) and I use two squirts in my hands, worked into wet hair. Any more and it is just too much oil, weighs the hair down and clumps up..  Just the right amount, and your hair will be silky, shiny, light, bouncy, etc... If you have very fine hair, or hair that tends to be greasy this is not for you, unless you&#x27;re using it as an oil treatment that you would wash out.</li>
    <li> i love how this product works perfectly for my hair. You just spray it and you see results in 3 days. my hair is smooth and shine :)</li>
    <li> I have thick naturally curly (3B/4A) hair. In the winter i suffer from dullness and extreme dryness. I&#x27;ve tied a ton of products, some of which don&#x27;t moisturize my hair enough, while others leave a yucky residue that leaves my hair even more dull than before and tons of build up on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;  I was recently turned on to the Shea Elixer by a friend of mine, and the difference is night and day! In the two weeks i&#x27;ve been using the spray my hair is bouncy shiny and downright amazing (if i do say so myself). I&#x27;ve gotten complments walking in the grocey store, so hopefully Shea will see a spike in sales from my testimonials. LOL.&lt;br /&gt;  I use as a sealing oil on freshly washed hair overtop of my leave in conditioner (done in twists or braids so i can get some oil on my scalp) I will also use nightly, with a light spritz all over, before putting on my bonnet. I can say nothing bad about it. Smells great, really does what it says it will. This will be part of my hair routine from this point forward.&lt;br /&gt;  I wish there was a way to give it more than 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> I have skin sensitivities which come with my autoimmune disorder and I have never had a problem with any of the Shea Moisture skin and hair care products.  Besides non-irritating, they are moisturizing and pampering.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb. After going no-poo (no shampoo) but only a co-washer (washing with only conditioner), I still needed the right moisturizing finish. THIS, one spritz in the palm of my hand along with a small blob of Shea Moisture&#x27;s Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Milk (dilute w/a shot of water) and it&#x27;s MAGIC! A couple of mixes to cover my whole head and I&#x27;m good. I have thick, easy curly hair, (Italian), that only needs the right encouragement to let my hair curl like it was meant to. (Try NOT to touch it while it&#x27;s wet, but shape it with those little clips if you need, and I usually wind up diffusing because 1) I&#x27;m impatient, and 2), thick hair, heavy and I need to keep it from drying pulled down by the weight.)&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile. when I was returning Shea Moisture&#x27;s Hold &amp; Shine Moisturizing spritz, because it did none of those things for my hair, this very sweet girl there took me over to the hair aisle to tell me how wonderful she found the Organix Penetrating Serum to be. But I went home, checked that item out and it had silicones. Sorry. Can&#x27;t go there. The Shea Moisture Elixir has no parafens, no silicones, no sulfates. It&#x27;s just awesome, and naturally good for my hair. For the reviewer who found it greasy, you probably used too much. It ISN&#x27;T greasy, and even after reviving my hair two days later with my mix (and I might thin it out with a shot of water from my spray bottle), my hair still was never greasy, and not weighted down with build up. Actually, the second and even the third day, my hair still looked great and even better than the first day. Love this item. I&#x27;d give it ten stars if I could. In the sea of products out there, this is awesome and NATURAL!  Good for your hair!  Now how much better can you get???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: When I saw my hairstylist the other day, for a WAY overdue haircut - 8 weeks, he pointed out that my ends showed VERY LITTLE damage - even about 1/4 of an inch!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I DO apply this to dry hair to revive curls between co-washings, and then spritz either water or a water mix diluting some Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Milk - just to dampen it enough. Scrunch and then DON&#x27;T TOUCH until it&#x27;s dry (my challenge). Great product. Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it makes my hair healthier and strengther without being oily. The shine stays all day.</li>
    <li> works really great for thick curly hair and does not leave your hair greasy. spray in hands and then apply to hair, this method works really well.</li>
    <li> I have normal thickness of hair.  Not fine nor course.  Nevertheless, I get dry scalp, DULL lifeless. Lackluster hair. I&#x27;ve recently changed to a healthy diet since I lacked omega 3, but I discovered this companies lotion a few years ago. Works amazing. This really is my fav brand for conditioner, lotion, and now hair elixir.  This did NOT make my hair greasy, however I guess if you have fine hair then it will make your hair greasy. I find best results when&#x27;s  applied to damp hair, NOT dry nor WET.  Comb thoroughly or run fingers through. Use the remains on your hand as lotion. Goodluck</li>
    <li> I only use this when my hair is really REALLY dry. Its too greasy to use as an everyday product.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair daily, sometimes twice a day and use products such as Moroccan oil on it to help retain moisture and for shine. I wanted a product for knew I couldn&#x27;t wash it daily and tried this. Works well. My hair looks clean and shiny and the product is much lighter than the heavier oils so washing your hair daily doesn&#x27;t need to occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it four stars because there are no instructions on how to use it. And I like instructions!</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair feeling greasy and oily. I use Shea Moisture&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner so I figured I would try this too. I was very disappointed! I have kinky curly hair and alternate between wearing it naturally styled, and blow drying and flat ironing it. When I wear it straight, I like my hair to bounce and be very light. That&#x27;s why I do not use a lot of styling products on my hair. Just two sprays of this and my hair was weighted down and looked oily. I even brushed it all the way through my hair to distribute it evenly but it made no difference. And when I wear my hair in a naturally curly style, this She Moisture Raw Shea Butter Reconstructive Finishing Elixir still makes my hair feel greasy. Yuck! I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly frizzy hair and love this product, it controls my hair and was a savior on vacation in the steamy hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;You just can&#x27;t use too much or you can get a slick look.</li>
    <li> So... I bought this mixture to keep my scalp from drying out while I had twisties. It did a pretty good job and kept my hair smelling good. Although I&#x27;m still not really sure if that&#x27;s the way it was meant to be used....</li>
    <li> I have fine (read: thin) caucasian hair and I bought this without being aware of the target consumer base that has thicker hair.  That being said, this product is not meant to style hair like mine.  I used it sparingly by spraying a short pump on my hands before I applied it, and my hair was weighed down immediately.  That being said, it smells so good that I have no intentions of giving it to any of my friends with coarser hair!  I&#x27;ll be using it as an overnight leave-in conditioner.  Even though this product didn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m glad that I found this brand and I look forward to trying out their soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at my local Target for about $6, so if you are thinking about buying this please don&#x27;t buy it through this seller.</li>
    <li> Its ok, not worth the pRice.  Greasy and sits on the hair.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  Can get cheaper product with similar results.</li>
    <li> If you have coarse, dry, damaged hair this elixir is EXCELLENT for transforming and taming your hair. I spray my hair at night and tie up with a stocking cap. by the next morning it has absorbed and hair is detangled, soft, oiled but not greasy, sooo manageable and best of all hair DOES NOT BREAK while combing. My hair always breaks off so that alone sold me. I have thick, coarse, dry hair and this is now my staple! This is really honestly all you need as it has a range of excellent ingredients that offer hair many many nutrients between washes. Most of the negative comments are coming from customers with oiled, fine/thinner hair which makes sense because this product seems to be PERFECT for hair that is thick dry damaged and thirsty. This is a revitalizer! I love it and recommend it highly :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it smells very nice, most of the good oils stink! She Moisture really got it right with this one</li>
    <li> I have been using this product with the shampoo and conditioner. I LOVE IT!!! I used to straighten my hair or use a curling iron a lot but now with these products my curls are less frizzy and more defined. Once I started using the shampoo and conditioner and the spray I got the body wash. I love these produces. I love that they are natural, are American made and a family run company and they smell AWSOME! My husband noticed when I switched and says I smell great and my hair looks so much healthier.</li>
    <li> Helps my parched color damaged hair feel &amp; look a lot healthier. Use after blow drying to smooth flyaways from breakage. Hair is silkier &amp; shinier. Smells really good but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this works for me. It gets EXTREMELY tangled and can be impossible to comb after a shower. I saw this elixir in a YouTube video and the girl recommended a lot of products I&#x27;d already tried and this one. She said this one was the best of the bunch and was her &amp;#34;cream of the crop&amp;#34;, so I had to try it. And OMG IT&#x27;S AMAZING! I only spritz it 1-2 times if my hair is really tangled, or I wear it at night. It really is an elixir. It takes away any tangles better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT. It also smells really, really good (all Shea Moisture products smell great). It leaves my hair shiny, soft, tangle free, and frizz free. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this. If your hair is extremely dry or tangled, try this. It&#x27;s better than It&#x27;s a 10, Pantene, argan oil, and every detangling product I&#x27;ve tried (which is A TON). I even like that it&#x27;s called an elixir because that&#x27;s exactly what it was for me.</li>
    <li> Great for sealing moisture into Black hair.  Light penetrating oil, actually soaks into that hair leaving it shiny, but not leave feeling greasy or heavy.  Takes just one squirt, so it actually goes a long way.</li>
