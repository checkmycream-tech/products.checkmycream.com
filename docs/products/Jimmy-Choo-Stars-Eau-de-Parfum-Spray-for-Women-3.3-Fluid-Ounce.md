    <li> This parfum smells awesome. I first discovered it when I was shopping at Macy&#x27;s. But I was hesitant to purchase it because it was expensive and I already own quite a few other perfumes. But, I saw it in different locations when I shopped and sampled it again, decided I really enjoy the fragrance. So, I purchase it on amazon. It is authentic and looks and smells like those I sampled at the department stores. The scent lasted for a long time. I am very happy!</li>
