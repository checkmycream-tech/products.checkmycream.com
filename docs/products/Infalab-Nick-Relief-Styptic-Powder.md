      <li>I was glad to find this product as I&#x27;ve never seen it in stores, and my one tube ran out years ago.  </li>
      <li>This particular product and vial is great.</li>
      <li>However in my experience that stinging sensation is more mild than most competitive products.  </li>
      <li>Since it come as a powder, it&#x27;s really easy to apply.</li>
      <li>stops the bleeding instantly, easy to keep around house or in car.</li>
      <li>Be sure at but a hand full of these.</li>
      <li>He is on blood thinners and says this is the best thing for clotting the little nicks and cuts he gets.</li>
      <li>This stuff comes in handy to stop the bleeding fast.</li>
      <li>I first bought this product many years ago from my barber.  </li>
      <li>, I often just let it bleed and clean up after I&#x27;m done.</li>
      <li>BUT A WORD TO THE WISE:  the powder will permanently stain items, especially towels.</li>
      <li>Best stuff for small cuts!  </li>
      <li>Stops bleeding quickly.</li>
      <li>Works quickly and well.  </li>
      <li>Quick Solution</li>
      <li>Over the first two months I purchased every available remedy to stem the flow.  </li>
      <li>Great for stopping minor and kind of serious cuts, scrapes, or whatever kind of woud you might get at work, or in the woods.</li>
      <li>Amazon.com had it and a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>It works fantastic though, better than any other styptic I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I keep a vial in my first aid kit</li>
      <li>I normal and a party or anywhere cool</li>
      <li>More importantly it works, the mild sensation a small price to pay for bringing the blood to a halt instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better than using toilet paper.</li>
      <li>Since this product has somewhat of a cosmetic (covering effect), I wouldn&#x27;t be too certain that it is the product, or the blood that is doing the staining.  </li>
      <li>As a straight razor newbie my morning shave started out as a bloodbath with every manner of cut, nick, and gash.  </li>
      <li>One of the reasons I use this methos is because the mfgrs caution about staining clothes is REAL</li>
      <li>Stops the bleeding fast.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t really do much on some deeper cuts.</li>
      <li>Really like that I can put a &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; of Nick Relief to take care of these cuts.</li>
      <li>Really like this product as I shave with a straight razor and it works well for deeper cuts.</li>
      <li>It may take sever applications depending on how much powder transfers to and from your finger.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommened it!</li>
      <li>Really works.      </li>
      <li>Blood itself is highly staining because of its iron content and the protein components of the blood that &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the stain.  </li>
      <li>Sure it burns, a little.</li>
      <li>Best technique is as follows: 1) put the tip of your index finger over the tube and invert it to apply a small amount of dry powder, 2) dab the nicked spot with tissue so it is dry, and 3) immediately dab the spot with your powdered finger tip.</li>
      <li>I really have nothing else to compare because this is the only product of its kind that I have used over the past fifteen years.  </li>
      <li>I like it far better than the styptic pencil you have to wet, or rub back and forth.</li>
      <li>Like most of the products in this category application can sting a little especially with deeper cuts and nicks.  </li>
      <li>I am \\&quot;old school\\&quot; when it comes to shaving.  </li>
      <li>So far even the deepest cuts have been controlled in just seconds.  </li>
      <li>I regularly slice open bits of my fingers and hands, this stuff does exactly what it is supposed to and stops the bleeding.</li>
      <li>Stops very minor bleeding fast.</li>
      <li>Sometimes the process may need to be repeated, but so too do all of the other products sometimes not succeed on first try.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone whether it be for professional or personal use.</li>
      <li>After a couple min of the bleeding not even slowing I dumped a small pile on my sink counter and quickly tapped the tip of my finger on it.</li>
      <li>A light dusting takes care of those small nicks instantly while a deep gash may require 2 applications.  </li>
      <li>Next day, after some cream was put on it over night, the wound was clear and flesh red</li>

<li> Next day, after some cream was put on it over night, the wound was clear and flesh red</li>
<li> I move fast in my work and nicks are common.</li>
<li> After the adrenaline from thinking I might have to go to the hospital wore off I sucked it up and brushed the residue off just the dark clotted blood left.</li>
<li> This works well to stop bleeding of minor icks caused by shaving.</li>
<li> It goes an unbelievably long way, as well.  </li>
<li> I had used it on only minor cuts until a few weeks ago...</li>
<li> But be careful, it can stain your shirt.</li>
<li> This product will stop blood flow quicker than any other that I&#x27;ve tried - even for those of us who take an aspirin a day for its blood-thinning effect against heart attacks.  </li>
<li> I open the cap and invert the tube between my thumb and index finger to deposit a small film of the powder onto my finger.  </li>
<li> So use it very carefully and sparingly.  </li>
<li> I have not been let down by this product once.</li>
<li> but as they get bigger and deeper you need something serious to get the bleeder under control.  </li>
<li> The trick is, no minding that it burns a little.</li>
<li> However, I&#x27;m bold, stupid, and lazy.</li>
<li> The tubes are small but you do not need a lot to stop the bleeding.  </li>
<li> I take blood medication and for small nicks and cuts this does help.  </li>
<li> Must be a \\&quot;hard to find\\&quot; item.  </li>
<li> I am on blood thinners and it is hard to stop bleeding.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve ever encountered (forget styptic pencils, worthless compared to this product) for arresting bleeding from razor nicks, paper cuts, etc., but VERY staining.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not the safest attitude, I know, but this stuff at least keeps me from having to wipe up blood, even when I get a cut that&#x27;s a bit worse than usual.</li>
<li> For very small nicks you can get away with almost anything</li>
<li> Less work than a styptic pencil as you merely dab it on with a fingertip.</li>
<li> It is difficult to find in the stores</li>
<li> I asked my barber for styptic powder and he was unable to get it for me.  </li>
<li> I am also a cook and the kitchen can also be a dangerous place for my fingers, so I keep a vial in the kitchen as well as the art studio.</li>
<li> As a multi media artist, I am always cutting myself!</li>

    <li> I have used almost every styptic product and this works best for me.

Sometimes the process may need to be repeated, but so too do all of the other products sometimes not succeed on first try.</li>
    <li> Stops the bleeding fast. Great companion for razor work</li>
    <li> I use this product when I nick myself while shaving.  I just open it up put a dab on the nick and the bleeding stop instantly.  I like it far better than the styptic pencil you have to wet, or rub back and forth.</li>
    <li> I am \\&quot;old school\\&quot; when it comes to shaving.  I still use the razor with the blade and NOT the electric shaver.  I, therefore, have a lot of nicks after shaving.  I asked my barber for styptic powder and he was unable to get it for me.  Must be a \\&quot;hard to find\\&quot; item.  Amazon.com had it and a very reasonable price.  I now know where to find styptic powder for the future.</li>
    <li> I regularly slice open bits of my fingers and hands, this stuff does exactly what it is supposed to and stops the bleeding. I keep a vial in my first aid kit and I often use this without bandaids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously we should all observe the best of hygiene and first aid rules. However, I&#x27;m bold, stupid, and lazy. When I&#x27;m working and a piece of metal gives me a good jab, I often just let it bleed and clean up after I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s not the safest attitude, I know, but this stuff at least keeps me from having to wipe up blood, even when I get a cut that&#x27;s a bit worse than usual.</li>
    <li> Works quickly and well.  I have not been let down by this product once.</li>
    <li> Great product to stop the bleeding fast. Better than using toilet paper. It actually feels like its working. Highly recommened it!</li>
    <li> As a straight razor newbie my morning shave started out as a bloodbath with every manner of cut, nick, and gash.  Over the first two months I purchased every available remedy to stem the flow.  For very small nicks you can get away with almost anything but as they get bigger and deeper you need something serious to get the bleeder under control.  Well look no further, this is the stuff, the only product you&#x27;ll ever need.  I open the cap and invert the tube between my thumb and index finger to deposit a small film of the powder onto my finger.  A light dusting takes care of those small nicks instantly while a deep gash may require 2 applications.  So far even the deepest cuts have been controlled in just seconds.  Like most of the products in this category application can sting a little especially with deeper cuts and nicks.  However in my experience that stinging sensation is more mild than most competitive products.  More importantly it works, the mild sensation a small price to pay for bringing the blood to a halt instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and check this out for yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a couple years ago to keep it around just in case. I had used it on only minor cuts until a few weeks ago... when I cut the tip of my finger off. After a couple min of the bleeding not even slowing I dumped a small pile on my sink counter and quickly tapped the tip of my finger on it. The bleeding instantly stopped. After the adrenaline from thinking I might have to go to the hospital wore off I sucked it up and brushed the residue off just the dark clotted blood left. Next day, after some cream was put on it over night, the wound was clear and flesh red (Since I took off a good chunk of both the epidermis and dermis. Any further and I might have hit bone) with no discoloration or issue. Weeks later it&#x27;s almost fully healed and I was thankful I had this. Saved me from what I know would have been a hospital visit just to stop the bleeding and for them to bandage it.</li>
    <li> Awesome...Quick Solution</li>
    <li> Works great.....wish I would have found this years ago for those pesty nics. But be careful, it can stain your shirt.</li>
    <li> Really like this product as I shave with a straight razor and it works well for deeper cuts. Had an alum block but it didn&#x27;t really do much on some deeper cuts. Really like that I can put a &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; of Nick Relief to take care of these cuts. Very inexpensive but a great product.</li>
    <li> best stuff in the world</li>
    <li> Is Barry good Parada powder sooner Apply is like nothing happened everything goes away I normal and a party or anywhere cool</li>
    <li> I used this product for years.  I am on blood thinners and it is hard to stop bleeding.  This power works for me.  A barber used it on me years ago and I have been using it since.</li>
    <li> This is the best around, way better than the sticks or the liquid. I would recommend this to anyone whether it be for professional or personal use.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find this product as I&#x27;ve never seen it in stores, and my one tube ran out years ago.  This is THE BEST way to stop more than a nick.  Really works.      So 5 STARS for the product!    BUT A WORD TO THE WISE:  the powder will permanently stain items, especially towels. So use it very carefully and sparingly.  Again, best product out there I&#x27;ve ever encountered (forget styptic pencils, worthless compared to this product) for arresting bleeding from razor nicks, paper cuts, etc., but VERY staining.  So 1 star on this measure.</li>
    <li> I take blood medication and for small nicks and cuts this does help.  it does stain and leaves a residue on your skin,but overall it helps.</li>
    <li> All mem should own this product and it&#x27;s excellent at stopping the blood ,it is a must-have in everyone&#x27;s first aid kit</li>
    <li> My dad is a cosmetologist an barber. He uses it in his shop. My husband an I also have a preteen who is learning how to shave. This stuff comes in handy to stop the bleeding fast.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product many years ago from my barber.  This is the product that he would apply when I got a nick from him shaving my outline or around my ears.  I was always impressed at how quickly it stopped the bleeding.  He says that he&#x27;s never found anything better in 53 years of barbering.  I wholeheartedly concur.  There have been a couple of comments about its propensity to stain clothing.  I have found this not to be a problem.  Blood itself is highly staining because of its iron content and the protein components of the blood that &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the stain.  It will put a permanent stain in any clothing if not properly removed before washing the garment.  Since this product has somewhat of a cosmetic (covering effect), I wouldn&#x27;t be too certain that it is the product, or the blood that is doing the staining.  This product will stop blood flow quicker than any other that I&#x27;ve tried - even for those of us who take an aspirin a day for its blood-thinning effect against heart attacks.  It goes an unbelievably long way, as well.  My last purchase was to share with my sons...</li>
    <li> This works well to stop bleeding of minor icks caused by shaving. Less work than a styptic pencil as you merely dab it on with a fingertip.</li>
    <li> Excellent way to control nicks painlessly and quickly from shaving or toenail bleeding in dogs</li>
    <li> Best stuff for small cuts!  stops the bleeding instantly, easy to keep around house or in car.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years, excellent results.</li>
    <li> Great for stopping minor and kind of serious cuts, scrapes, or whatever kind of woud you might get at work, or in the woods. something i always carry in my hunting bag.</li>
    <li> As a multi media artist, I am always cutting myself! Either a knife, an exacto blade, a needle. I move fast in my work and nicks are common. I do not want to wear a bandaid when I am using my hands as it can be too limiting to my movements. I am also a cook and the kitchen can also be a dangerous place for my fingers, so I keep a vial in the kitchen as well as the art studio. Stops very minor bleeding fast. Like many reviewers, I&#x27;ve used styptic powder for years and always have some on hand. This particular product and vial is great.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that works for my husband when he nicks himself while shaving. It is difficult to find in the stores so he was delighted when I found it online.</li>
    <li> Time proven product. Works great, but some one should invent a dispenser for to for easier application.</li>
    <li> hi love the product  great price thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and never see it in pharmacies anywhere. Does it burn when you use it? Sure it burns, a little. The trick is, no minding that it burns a little. It works fantastic though, better than any other styptic I&#x27;ve ever used. Since it come as a powder, it&#x27;s really easy to apply. Be sure at but a hand full of these. Not just for shaving either. . .</li>
    <li> Great product, have used and will use for years</li>
    <li> great for Barber work</li>
    <li> I really have nothing else to compare because this is the only product of its kind that I have used over the past fifteen years.  The tubes are small but you do not need a lot to stop the bleeding.  I have found the easiest way to apply is to remove cover, put my finger over the open end, shake it, and dab the bleeding area with what ever powder had stuck to my finger.  It may take sever applications depending on how much powder transfers to and from your finger.  One of the reasons I use this methos is because the mfgrs caution about staining clothes is REAL and I find this methods tends to keep thing neat.  Bottom line, it works and works well.</li>
    <li> My father asks me to order this product for him on a regular basis.  He is on blood thinners and says this is the best thing for clotting the little nicks and cuts he gets.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Almost no burning sensation when applied.Stops bleeding quickly.Great product.</li>
