<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Definitely one of the better products out there for curly frizzy hair. I have naturally curly frizzy hair, and I am not talking a few frizzy strands. This definitely smooths my hair and defines the curl. Whether I put a little or a lot, it still tends to dry a little crispy, but I finger comb it or use a pick and it softens up and still maintains the shape and frizz free. I don&#x27;t put anything else in my hair and I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I ordered these 3 items as a hair treatment to replace my Brazilian blowout products and Matrix SleekLook. They didn&#x27;t even come close to being able to smooth my hair during shampooing in the shower or during blow drying with a round brush. The flat iron didn&#x27;t help. My hair felt coarse and full of fly always. I was surprised since this is the same company that makes Kerastase. I returned all 3, the shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in creme. I have thick, curly, long, coarse hair that normally blows out straight with the right products. I re-ordered Kerastase Oleo Relax and Slim. It&#x27;s much more expensive but works every time. Maybe this product is for thinner, lightly curly hair.</li>
    <li> O.K. Believe it or not, I finally have my hair product routine nailed down to combat my frizzy, naturally curly hair! The cabinet under my sink is filled with countless products that I&#x27;ve bought and tried, with minimal success. This L&#x27;Oreal product feels and smells great. I&#x27;ve tried lots of leave-in conditioners, but none keep the frizz at bay. Since I&#x27;ve started using this, I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair anymore, even in the summer. I do combine this with other products, but this product really does make a difference. It feels lightweight, and I love the way my hair feels and smells with it in. I have fine, professionally dyed blond hair. This is now my routine (please note that this has been my routine with another leave-in conditioner, but it&#x27;s now more effective with the L&#x27;Oreal product): (1) I start with a small amount of mousse for adding volume to the crown area; (2) a nickel-size amount of One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil distributed throughout and combed through; (3) 2 pumps of L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek Leave-In Creme, distributed throughout and combed through; (4) about a quarter-size of Crome BloneSoft Flexible Hold Conditioning Gel for holding style, distributed throughout with fingers; (5) two pumps of John Frieda Weather Works Frizz-Ease Style Sealant Creme for sealing the hair against humidity, distributed throughout and combed. While hair is wet, fluff it out with fingertips and scrunch and lift to give it some body. Then 2-3 pumps of Phyto Phytolisse Serum over the entire top of hair to give it shine. I let my hair COMPLETELY dry naturally (I only have to wash my hair once a week because it&#x27;s dry). When it&#x27;s dry, I used a 1\\&quot; curling iron to smooth the air and give it some style. Finger fluff it out. Don&#x27;t comb the first day. Before going out, spray generously with Garnier Fructis Flexible Control, Anti-Humidity Hairspray. It is not the least bit sticky or stiff. You&#x27;ll be able to comb your hair with no problem, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like most hairsprays. I do hope this helpsthose of you with lifelong frizz problems like it did for me!</li>
    <li> This product is horrible, it leaves a film in my hair that if left to dry naturally dries hard and if I dry with a hairdryer it feels weird, I would not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product does not do anything for my hair.  It also smells like soap. Don’t waste your money! I am AA with a relaxer so I was looking for something to help control frizz after working out. Doesn’t do  a thing so the search continues.</li>
    <li> I live on the West Coast and often don&#x27;t have to worry about humidity issues, but I wanted something to help tame my unruly hair for my trip to Maryland, which was also smack-dab in the middle of springtime. I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for this inexpensive product, but was low and cash and decided to give it a go.     I was happily surprised by how great this product really is and how well it worked on my hair. I&#x27;m biracial, with thick and slightly damaged 3A/3B/3C hair. Up until this product, nothing would really keep the frizz down (Frizzease, etc), even when my hair was straight, which is how I planned to keep it as during the trip. This stuff did a fantastic job, even with when my hair was curly. What&#x27;s more is that it was raining quite a bit while I was in Maryland, but my flat-ironed hair didn&#x27;t turn into its typical troll doll state as it usually does.     I love that it makes my hair soft, doesn&#x27;t weigh things down and that it also has some beneficial ingredients such has argan oil, which I know works wonders on my hair already. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s silicone and sulfate-free. Since the weather is pretty bone-dry on the West Coast this summer, I don&#x27;t need it as much, but I did feel that it made my hair extra soft.    If you&#x27;re curious about the ingredients, they seem to be as follows: Aqua (Water) , Stearyl Alcohol , Glyceryl Stearate SE , Glycerin , Cetyl Esters , Inulin , Caprylic , Capric Triglyceride , Dicaprylyl Ether , Parfum , Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil (Sunflower Seed Oil) , Simmondsia Chinensis Oil (Jojoba Seed Oil) , Hydroxypropyl Guar , Sodium Benzoate , Caprylyl Glycol , Xanthan Gum , Olea Europaea Oil (Olive Fruit Oil) , Citric Acid , Ethylhexyl Palmitate , Argania Spinosa Oil (Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil) , Hexyl Cinnamal , Linalool , Tocopherol , Benzyl Alcohol , Citronellol , Coumarin , Geraniol    Would purchase again and I&#x27;m liking the other products in the Eversleek line as well.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this new product after the one I used previously by Garnier had been discontinued.  Everything felt good. It was easy to apply to damp hair, made blow drying the hair a lot quicker and made my hair look good after blowdrying.  A half hour after I had finished blow drying my hair however, my skull got very itchy. And an hour later I had a bad headache from this product.  I had to rewash my hair to remove this stuff after three hours due to these problems of Headache and Itchy Skull.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine, color treated wavy to curly hair that some days I let dry curly, but most I blow out and put large waves in... I have been looking for a product to keep my hair smooth and not frizzy when I blow it out, improve the fine texture but keep it soft, as I hate my hair to feel anything but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything, conditioners, deep conditioners, top of the line, drugstore brand, smoothing cremes, serums... Anything that actually smoothed left my hair feeling yuck...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works, changed the nature of my hair to smoother, sleeker texture... I love the Intense conditioner too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjust how much you need for what you want, more for sleeker, but a little sticky or waxy feeling, less for softer, but not quite as controlled... my just below shoulder length, fine hair takes just under one pump for a good amount of smoothness, but still soft throughout the day...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing if using the sulfate frees over time improves my hair...</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair so I need something to make it look thicker. This product does just that. I use it on damp hair with other thickening products and it works very well. I definitely would recommend this product if you want your hair to look fuller.</li>
    <li> Indeed does as advertised, keeps hair straight and frizz-free in humidity.</li>
    <li> Like this because of price and also because its CG friendly. At the time felt I needed a finishing product, but it has turned out much more.  After my oil blend is mix with Evercreme Nourishing Conditioner are left in as a deep treatment, I do a cool rinse add my leave-in and style with gel, hair is extra hydrated smooth and soft a JOY... you can also add three pumps to cool boiled water (4oz) to make your daily spritz perfect!! Thanks to L&#x27;oreal  I am happy to be natural my hair is doing great no fuss and without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t understand why the reviews for this stuff are all over the place. With my normal shampoo and conditioner combination, my hair is a little frizzy, but always soft... until I used this product. It turned it stiff and it felt like straw. I just wish I had found a free sample instead of paying full price for a full bottle. Hopefully, I can save someone else the cost of putting this horrid junk in their hair.</li>
    <li> A leave-in conditioner that imparts body to limp hair.  I love it.  I don&#x27;t know of anything like it on the market.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! The whole EverSleek (and EverPure &amp; EverStrong) line is great, but the EverSleek Humidity Defying Leave-In Cream, as well as the EverSleek Repairative Conditioner, are REALLY, REALLY good!!! I used to use Kerastase, which is WAY more expensive, and didn&#x27;t work as good as this leave-in cream. I have fine, very curly, puffy, frizzy hair, and this stuff changes the texture of my hair like no other leave-in product ever has!!!!  It puts my hair in smooth, shiny, almost perfect corkscrews, which I thought was impossible for my hair. In high humidity, it still gets just a tad frizzy, but this is still the best product ever...and its inexpensive!!! My hair is just past my shoulders, and I&#x27;ve found that 1.5 pumps is great for my hair...1 pump is not quite enough, &amp; 2 pumps makes my hair limp. It has a lot of different kinds of oils in it, not silicone, so it seems that it is actually moisturizing your hair.  Haven&#x27;t tried the Eversleek mask, but am definately going to!!! I&#x27;m going to be very distraught if they ever quite making this product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is easier to put in hair and keeps the shiny and healthiness in and the frizz and fly aways out. I went outside so many times today and it definitely defies humdity.I like alot of different products Dove Aussie Herbal Essences John Frieda Tresemme Renpure etc. But I&#x27;m sticking with this.     It works really really well. I have to have this my hair is really long and this makes all of my hair including the ends! smooth! And it&#x27;s natural it&#x27;s the best I will definitely buy it again when I run out.     I even read once that over time the ammonium laureth sulfates in cheaper shampoos and conditioners eat away at hair follicles. Who knows for sure? But I know I like this alot and it works for me Thank God and secondly thank you L&#x27;oreal please don&#x27;t take this off the market ever it&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s day 2 since I have been using this and it&#x27;s amazing. I love the way it&#x27;s controlled my friz and made my curls beautiful. I have shine in my hair and got so many compliments saying how healthy my hair look. I have been investing in the wrong products all this time where I could have stopped at the local drug store and picked up this bottle for less than $10!!   Great product - Highly recommend it to any one who have crazy frizzy, uncontrollable, dry, damaged hair.</li>
    <li> works well. priced well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I received a sample and fell in love with it.  It helps keep my hair from getting frizzy, even after hot flashes.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores so I ordered it on Amazon.  I highly recommend it.  A little goes a long way, and it leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.  The shampoo and conditioner in this product line are great as well.</li>
    <li> Best product for taming wild curly hair ever.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so smoothing and definitely worth the price.  I love that it&#x27;s also an amazon add-on item for less $.  For use out of the shower, it&#x27;s a leave in cream and totally worth it.  Use it after using the leave-in conditioner in the shower.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked! I very often try new hair products and after going through 6 or 7 new ones I have found my new favorites. Holds up well in humidity, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> For my frizzy, curly, type 3c hair this works really good after washing and conditioning. I don&#x27;t need any other product to finish my hairstyling. But: be carefull, at first I used to many, and that can make your hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I liked the one in the purple bottle much better for my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have your average head of curly hair.  It&#x27;s very thick and the curls are very tight.  I bought this thinking it was a leave in conditioner.  I didn&#x27;t realize that it also had hold to it.  In the past I&#x27;ve used Biolage&#x27;s Hydrofoam (very expensive) and Herbal Essence mousse (works well, but I have to use a LOT!).  I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this product.  I comb through about two pumps after washing and toweling dry my hair.  I then let it dry naturally.  It really tames my frizzy curls, and I often get two days out of one washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have complained about it being heavy or greasy feeling, but if you have thick, coarse, curly hair like mine you want heavy and slightly greasy (I can totally see how this would be too heavy for many hair types).  And as an added bonus, it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was compelled to write a review because two stores I&#x27;ve been in recently have stopped carrying this product in the EverSleek line.  I just hope that L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t stop making it!  When you have my kind of hair it&#x27;s rare to find a product that works this well.</li>
    <li> It felt very sticky after I applied it to my hair :( that was my number one concern!! And I don&#x27;t feel like it actually nourished my hair, it just seemed to give it a shine...</li>
    <li> I have naturally unruly wavy hair... not in a cute way. The waves are normally too loose, random, and frizzy to qualify as a style, so I tend to straighten my hair. But with this product, I can wear my hair wavy and it actually looks like a style-- beach waves, loose but not frizzy. I have thickish hair just past my shoulders. I wash my hair at night and it air dries as I sleep, and in the am I put some water in my hands and distribute through my hair to make it just slightly damp. Then I pump one pump on my hands and carefully distribute it through my hair, scrunching as I go. Then it just air dries the rest of the way while I put on my makeup. Love the look and get compliments all the time from people who think I spend a lot of time on my hair ;)</li>
    <li> This cream is really nice. I usually take a shower every morning and put on this cream.  It keeps my hair looks nice an shiny the whole day. It also has a very nice smell.  I started to use in on my child&#x27;s hair after showering him. it makes his hair look nice and easy to brush throughout the whole day</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products for my naturally-curly hair.  I apply it generously when my hair is wet, and once it has air-dried I scrunch.  Makes my spiral curls look great.</li>
    <li> The hair does not gett frizzy but get sticky after applying it, i would suggest not buy this product. it doesnt worth it</li>
    <li> I have very curly frizzy hair. Summer in Ohio is hot &amp; humid &amp; my hair is always crazy. This stuff is great. Woke up this morn to smooth shiny hair.</li>
    <li> My hair frizzes in the summer and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I don&#x27;t like how it makes my hair feel.  Perhaps it&#x27;s best for those that don&#x27;t blow dry their hair - maybe for put on and go hairstyles. It also took me forever to dry my hair - not sure if it worked or not.</li>
    <li> This stuff is miraculous. Individual strands of my hair are fine, but I have very unruly, thick, curly hair. I live where there is high humidity and this holds up better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it every day and it has made a huge difference. It makes my hair very curly and manageable and gets rid of a lot of the frizz. Definitely give it a try!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this stuff works great! I add this with a little hair oil with curl gel and I&#x27;m good to go. Really fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works great even on my fine hair and doesnt weigh hair down. Hair can look a little oily if used when letting hair dry naturally but i only use it when i blow dry my hair. I can even skip conditioner in the shower when I use this. The pump bottle makes it easy to use the same amount each time.  I use one full pump each day.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and use this after towel-drying my hair and before I put on my normal hair product. Keeps the frizzes away beautifully without spending a fortune on expensive products. Cheaper here on subscribe and save than my local Walmart.</li>
    <li> This works great as a leave in conditioner &amp; smells amazing. I love it and will continue to use and reorder.</li>
    <li> Does dramatically cut down on frizz from humidity easy to use too!</li>
    <li> this is exactly one i wanted. the quality is good and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> one of the best leave ins i have used, very detangling and has good enough oils for dry and curly hair, but my favorite thing is the smell, one of the best, so gentle, clean smell that stays in the hair, love it period</li>
    <li> Gave me the best twist-out I&#x27;ve ever had.  I added this product after misting my hair with water, adding a hydrating pudding or curling pudding, then this humidity defying cream and then a small dab of gel to each section.  Woke up and untwisted and for the first time since going natural, my twists did not frizz as soon as I styled them.  Using the whole thing turns in to an afro since my hair is chin length and I like to unravel my twists.  With this anit-frizz cream, I&#x27;m sure I will be able to go 2-3 days on one twist-out and I live in HotLanta!!  Prior to adding this product I was desperate to find something that would prevent my thick curly hair from turning in to an afro by mid day.  This is a life saver!!</li>
    <li> Over the last year I have gone through a BUNCH of leave ins and keep coming back to this one.  For example, I really like Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Milk, it leaves my hair very very soft and makes the curls pop, but it tends to be a bit heavy for my hair int he sense that it takes a LOOOOng time (maybe 5 hours?)  to be 100% completely dry and not greasy looking.  Similar problems with other leave ins.    I have a TON of 3b/3c hair, like even when I part my hair, you can barely see the scalp unless I really pull the hair aside.  But it is also SUPER dry so I have to use A LOT of product to give it moisture and avoid the frizz.    This loreal leave in is my current holy grail in the sense that it is not heavy, so I can apply a lot to make my curls clump and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t take forever to air dry (only about 3 hrs!  hey that&#x27;s good for me LOL)  and it does leave my hair very soft after it is dry and even gives me decent second day hair.    I do need a styling sealing product after this leave in, and again, after trying many gels, custards etc, I keep going back to Pantene&#x27;s regular curling mousse.  This leave-in, plus pantene&#x27;s curling mouse gives me very defined soft curls that stay fairly frizz free all day (I live in dry, low humidity area).    I hope Loreal keeps making this because I really do not have a second best option at the moment.    UPDATE: as of Nov. 2014 I continue to use this product as my daily leave in. However, I have added a little extra, because my hair is so dry that it was getting a little damaged using only this and the Pantene Mousse. I never have time to do Deep treatments so maybe that&#x27;s why.    So to help my hair from drying out,  I found out I need to add a bit of a heavier, oilier leave in.  My two current go to&#x27;s are Shea Moisture Curl Milk or Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful Sweet Ambrosia (cheapest place for these is Target.  The Loreal I buy in bulk here at Amazon).       My magic ratio is a ton of the loreal and a touch of the Curl Milk or Sweet Ambrosia.  For example, I think I squirt about 2 full quarters full of Loreal on my palm, and add about 1 dime worth of the other leave in, mix it all in very well in my palm and then apply to my hair, which is parted in half, left side first, then right side, or whatever, and comb through really well with my fingers.      I also switched out of my Pantene mousse to Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Gel.  Also from Amazon.  I apply that as final step, while helping the curls along with my fingers.      This system has been working super well.  So I thought I&#x27;d share for any ladies with extra dry 3B/3C curls!</li>
    <li> I use this product each time I shampoo my hair. It keeps the frizzies under control without flattening too much. I try not to forget to use this product. I massage it in after towel drying. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m testing long curly hair against a very humid environment here in DC, and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference between using this product and going without it.  I will not spend the money on it again because it doesn&#x27;t fight the frizz as I expected it would.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has become impossible to find in retail stores.  I have tried Walgreens, Walmart, Target, etc.  I&#x27;m not really sure why it is no longer in the stores.  I have thick wavy hair which I blow dry with round brush.  This product makes it very smooth and keeps it from getting frizzy in humidity.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair, has nice scent and helps untangle after I wash it. It does seem to make hair smoother.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great!!! I bought several of these because I love the product but only gave it 4 stars because a couple of pumps did not work, so I had switch pumps from other bottles, but this would have been a bigger nuisance if I didn&#x27;t have an extra bottle/pump with which to do this.</li>
    <li> My hair is normally unmanageable. I can normally not even run my fingers through it after a shower. Its super thick and curly (I have italian thickness and spanish curls) but this has made my hair nice, soft, and tame. I no longer find myself having to straighten my hair to style it because this makes my hair nice and smooth. There is no more frizz and poofyness!!! Super happy with my hair!!! After a shower I use one pump of it and comb it through my hair and boy is it noticeable! I thought my hair was done after bleaching it but this has restored it back to the way it was before I ever dyed it! LOVE THIS</li>
    <li> Better than the other keratin products I have used.  Makes my hair silky but not oily.  Loved all the Loreal products for smoothing</li>
    <li> My Granddaughters have flyaway hair and this product works great to eliminate that problem.</li>
    <li> The product arrived within the expected period, it is great.</li>
    <li> Got a sample in the mail of the new Ever Sleek shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner.  The shampoo and conditioner were \\&quot;fine\\&quot; meaning, they didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair; nothing as promised on the bottle...just \\&quot;fine\\&quot;.  The leave in treatment on the other hand.. HATED IT! Sticky, greasy, yucky mess. I added a pea size amt to my palm and smoothed it all over my hair concentrating on the ends like it suggested. It even looks like lotion, it is thick and white. When I went to style it, it wouldn&#x27;t dry, I blew it dry and combed it out. It felt like I had a glob of lotion in my hair. It was sticky, and would not hold curl on the ends like I normally style it. It looks ok but when you touch it, it just feels gross and greasy. I threw the rest of the sample away. I never want this junk in my hair again!  I will stick with the nice spray leave in treatments I have been using thank you very much.  I guess if you have REALLY frizzy coarse hair, you may like this stuff, but if you have fine slighly frizzy hair or if you plan to put a curling iron thru your hair do not use this. You probably won&#x27;t like it.  I\\&quot;m happy I didn&#x27;t pay for a full size.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the ONLY product that has every worked well with my curly hair. I am 20 years old and had been straightening my curly hair since the 5th grade.  Straightening was a hassle but I just could not keep my curls under control. I hated the way gel made my hair hard and sticky and still left it frizzy &amp; mousse does nothing good for your hair because of all of the alcohol.  As a fluke, I picked up this product and decided to try it this summer.  It&#x27;s been 5 months and I&#x27;ve literally straightened my hair maybe 3 or 4 times since.  After NINE years of straightening my hair all through my adolescence and hating my curly hair, I found a product that has made me LOVE my curls.  I use about a pump and a half on my mid-back length curls after I&#x27;ve washed my hair and blotted the water out as much as I can with a cotton shirt.  I let that sit for a few minutes while I do make up and etc and then add about a quarter sized amount of mousse for my entire hair just to set in the style.   I have never gotten so many compliments on my curls. They&#x27;re super soft, not AT ALL crunchy, and full of bounce and fun!! I CANNOT express how happy I am that this product exists.  The bottle lasts me about 3 months (I use it every other day when I was my hair).  I use it with EverStrong Shampoo, which I would also definitely recommend (Sulfate free is the way to go!!) and with John Frieda frizz ease conditioner.  I switched from the John Frieda conditioner and tried the eversleek conditioner for a while but it really made my hair unhappy. (It was beginning to dry out and get frizzy again).</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I think it does a really good job with keeping my hair smooth.  I have thin hair that is neither straight nor curly.  I apply 1/2 to 1 full pump to towel-dried hair, comb through and then blow dry.  I feel like this thickens my hair even though it doesn&#x27;t claim to do so.  I was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find this in any stores near me anymore but am glad to see it on Amazon.  I will continue to purchase as long as I&#x27;m able to.</li>
    <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverSleek Humidity Defying Leave-In Crème is incredible. I have very curly hair and have been looking for a cheaper alternative to Redken and Bumble &amp; Bumble products. Finally, I found something that works and is affordable! It&#x27;s super light, sweet smelling, and the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands super sticky and greasy all day. Aside from that, it leaves my hair in great condition and I am able to style it with just this one cream, as opposed to several different products. I&#x27;m amazed at how well it tames frizz and keeps my curls intact. I highly recommend this product, especially for those who have curly hair that has a mind of its own, never looks the same way twice, and is hard to control. I&#x27;m definitely buying more!</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair and this is just o.k.  I have found the sulfate-free L&#x27;Oreal for curly hair is much, much better.</li>
    <li> Use it to tame my curlz the next day.</li>
    <li> Great hair care products.</li>
    <li> I picked this up because my fine hair tends to have numerous fly aways on the top of my head and occasionally frizzes out on the sides in humid weather thanks to the natural waves in my hair. I use a straightener every day but still some of those pesky hairs just won&#x27;t cooperate. I was excited to try this.. until I actually used it. It recommends 2-3 pumps of creme and I used 1, being it was my first time and I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it. Not only did it do NOTHING for the frizz, it made my hair stiff and greasy. My hair that is normally soft and shiny is now a clump of gross, greasy straw. It has been a WEEK and I have washed my hair once or twice daily to get rid of it and my hair is STILL stiff and greasy. Maybe this is only intended for extremely curly or frizzy hair and it&#x27;s not the right product for my hair type, but jeez, at least let me wash it out!! :( VERY frustrated and returning for a refund.</li>
    <li> Product along with conditioner made hair feel like it still hade product in it after it was washed out and dried...very unhappy with it</li>
    <li> This product definitely helps with frizz and makes your hair smells great in the process. My boyfriend was constantly telling me I smell good when I used this. I mostly use argan oil for my hair which works better but this was a pretty good alternative when I ran out of argan oil. I got a sample in the mail and loved how it smelled and tamed the frizz so I gave it a try and I would get this again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased at least 10 different brands over the last couple of years.  This one is light weight, smells great, and the pump helps me control the amount I use.  I am pretty happy with this one.  It helps eliminate static and smooths out really thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years, and for hair my length (back pocket length), it adds moisture where my natural oils cannot reach. The natural scalp oils have trouble reaching beyond so many inches so I substitute using this leave-in conditioner. I then braid my hair. The next day when I take out the braid, I have silky, shiny hair that has luster. Without this product my hair is drab and dull. My hair color is dirty blonde/blonde/light brown tones. The blonde hairs look more ragged because of the process of coloring. This product brings life to that part of my hair, making it look as healthy as the hairs that do not receive color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot think of a better product for myself. You don&#x27;t want to use too much as it can draw lint, making it stick to your hair more than if nothing was in it. ;)</li>
    <li> Wife cannot find locally any more.  Glad she found the product here.</li>
    <li> I think this is a very good leave-in creme, but not the best I&#x27;ve used.  I like the Bumble and Bumble and Sunsilk leave-ins better.  This might be a better match for other people.  And the price is really affordable compared to the other 2 leave-ins I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that a leave-in conditioner is a good base for my &amp;#34;confused,&amp;#34; shoulder length hair.  My hair is a moody, not quite straight, not quite wavy, not thin, not thick, frizzy hot mess.  Products help a lot, especially a good leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> It may seem stifff feeling when you put on but it does its job well after dried</li>
    <li> Works on my long dry, color treated curly hair. And no sulfates. We have enough toxins put in our bodies, don&#x27;t need more!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I have dry frizzy unmanageable curly hair. this product makes my hair feel silky and hydrated. I put it on when my hair is still wet and it dried so nice. You gotta watch out if you put too much on it might make your roots a little greasy looking.</li>
    <li> I have wavy frizzy hair. I don&#x27;t like blow drying my hair because it gets damaged very easily. Instead I use cremes like this to help it stay down. I have used several and this one is the one that worked the best. Yes, it is a little sticky but I don&#x27;t care as long as it tames my lion mane. It is the only one that got rid of the frizz and kept my hair frizz free even after a little bit of rain. It does last for 48 hours, even more, but eventualy you have to wash your hair. The first time I used it, my scalp felt a little itchy but it does not do that anymore. I took a star away because it is sticky and when I use it my hair gets dirty faster. Other than that, I like the ingredients, and I think it smells ok. I have good day hair when I use it, and it does not damage my delicate hair.</li>
    <li> WOW! This is the first product I have ever found to make my frizzy hair into the nice curly waves I love. I live in Hawaii which has crazy humidity. I hadn&#x27;t found a product before this one that made my frizz disappear without making my hair feel sticky or oily. I have very thick, frizzy hair, and tons of hair so I always have a lot of volume with my frizz. I used to only wear my hair in a bun or flat iron my hair when I go out because the frizz on my natural hair is just too much. This product tames the frizz &amp; lets your natural curls come out. AMAZING. Highly recommend this product &amp; what a bonus that it&#x27;s only $5!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair impossible to brush. I don&#x27;t know why but I use it the way it has to be: wet hair after washing. I can&#x27;t brush my hair after I use it. It is on the trash can after many chances</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair with this stuff.  Seems like it&#x27;s too light maybe too watered down.</li>
    <li> I have super thin frizzy curly hair but when i use this to leave my hair curly itsleaves nice big frizz-free curls. I also use it before i flat iron and i feel like it does protect my hair</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Makes my hair so soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair smooth and shiny! Also smells really good :)</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work PERIOD! I live in Florida. so say hello humidity. This product doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does! Try Living Proof products...more $$ but it works!</li>
    <li> I live in very humid climate.  This stuff really works to keep the frizz down and my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> With my recently bleached hair and the million degree heat and humidity this summer in nyc, my hair was a giant fluff of frizz and dryness. I got this and used in wet hair. My comb went all. the. way. through. I used Loreal&#x27;s Evercream leave in spray and it took me 20 minutes to detangle.</li>
    <li> I use this product every time I wash my natural curly hair. It helps give a nice smooth curly look to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed 4c type hair for those who don&#x27;t  know it&#x27;s very a course texture. My hair tends to be naturally dry and I&#x27;m trying to take better care of it. I gave this a try for about  couple of months now the health of my hair has improved. It&#x27;s made it easier  for me to air dry my hair after washing it, my hair is not as frizzy and brittle. I will continue to use it and see how it works on my new growth.</li>
    <li> I really do like this. I put it on when my hair is damp out of the shower, and it makes it smoother and softer. Just watch how much you use, if you overdo it, it can become greasy feeling. It works best on frizzy, dry areas like the ends.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek Cr&amp;egrave;me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works very much like a leave-in conditioner. It left my hair silky soft but did not ever feel greasy or sticky. I wouldn&#x27;t use it to style my hair or expect it to hold very well, but it does seem to hydrate my hair and it smells great like conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t contain any silicones or polymers that coat hair, and instead uses natural oils to fight the effects of humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5, rather pricey but does a great job as a leave-in conditioner or cr&amp;egrave;me that uses natural oils.</li>
    <li> Sorry but this stuff made my hair frizzy puffy and ugly. I looked like I had a helmet on. I only used a very small amount in my thick wavy hair. Not recommending this to anyone :(&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I decided to give this stuff another chance since it has such great review. And boy am I glad that I did! I used more than my usual tiny pea sized amount of product this time (about a dime size this time) and this stuff is fantastic! My hair is smooth and isnt frizzy or puffy anymore. I live in Florida so that is quite a feat for this product to accomplish :) I would recommend this to thick frizzy puffy haired people</li>
    <li> I think the price is fair for this pleasant product with it&#x27;s light feel and subtle scent.  It&#x27;s not a miracle in a bottle, but it does seem like a decent smoothing leave in cream for hair that can be coarse and dry.  It smells good and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, but I did find that I also needed a touch of argan oil even with this product.</li>
    <li> Its my wife that loves this, actually. She has really long, thick hair (takes three days to dry after washing).  This is the only product she will put in her hair (besides shampoo and conditioner).</li>
    <li> My hair is too flat after using this product.  Even when you use just a little bit, itn still is greasy looking.</li>
    <li> My grandmother loves this, she got this once on clearance and has me order it for her online</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and can&#x27;t get it at my store anymore.  Arrived quickly.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I live in FLorida and humidity is high so frizz control is a must-have here. This product works well and is priced ok.</li>
    <li> Smell good but did not do anything else on my hair. I was expecting more, after I use I feel like my hair doesn&#x27;t have any product at all.  Does not help do anything also beside the good smell.</li>
    <li> This is what I was looking for the greatest product&lt;br /&gt;for my type hair.  Love it love it love it.</li>
    <li> This is great for my 4c hair during a bantu knot out, it helps hold but also form the perfect curl, very moisturizing, but take note if your hair gets wet you will feel this slick, slip type of feel. The feelinging may not be all that pleasant but for me it hint that it&#x27;s working in a way.</li>
    <li> I used this leave-in treatment after using the shampoo and conditioner from the same product line. Overall, I would say that the whole system is good, but not perfect. (It is free of parabens, sulfates, silicones, and synthetic dyes, so may be good for people avoiding particular ingredients.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has some definite benefits: I noticed a reduction in frizz (not a 100% reduction, but a reduction, nonetheless). I can&#x27;t speak to 48 hour control because I wash my hair every day. But I would say it&#x27;s decent at 24 hour control. It also made quite a good detangler. I applied this to wet hair and combed it through with a detangling brush, and it worked as well as a detangling spray. So that was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few things I didn&#x27;t like as much. First, you really have to be careful about how much you use. I used a fair amount because I have a lot of hair (mine is thick and down to my waist). And my hair absorbed this quickly. It didn&#x27;t leave a residue when my hair was still wet -- but I did notice residue once my hair dried. You also need to make sure the product is evenly-distributed. There were some parts of my hair where I guess I didn&#x27;t brush this through very well, and they were stiff the next day -- I had to do a LOT of brushing to remedy that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a leave-in treatment, this performs well enough for the price -- especially if you&#x27;re careful about applying it and distributing it evenly. 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very light product and I need to use a lot... a whole lot.  It is the only product I&#x27;ve found that controls frizz but my hair stays soft and touchable and looks completely natural.  You can&#x27;t tell I used any \\&quot;product.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product at all.  First the bottle came with the dispenser broken almost completely off which was bad on the packaging end, but the product itself is extremely greasy &amp; weighs your hair down.  Then after a couple of hours it almost felt like it dried my hair out and I had fly-aways every where.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!!!!!! this is the first time in my life i use a product that leaves my hair sooooo shiny, soooooft and silky!!!!! , i,ve noticed that my hair does not like silicones, my hair has a BKT so i cant use anything with sulfates or sodium or cones (remember that in order to remove most of silicons from your hair you need a shampoo with sulfate which is the fisrt enemy of the BKT), i use the shampoo from keratin research which is the keratin treatment i got (bought here on amazon which i totally recommend) this shampoo is perfect and so soft coz it has no cones, no sodium or sulfates, then i use the deep conditioner from loreal eversleek and then this defying leave-in creme and OH MY GOD!!!! this is one the moments i worry and think &#x27;i hope they never discontinue this product!!!</li>
