      <li>The package arrived in 3 days which was good.</li>
      <li>This is a good hair spray for men.</li>
      <li>This allows you to get good coverage without over applying.</li>
      <li>off.&lt;br /&gt;Other than needing a better cap design, this holds well and has a great manly scent to it.</li>
      <li>The time I did get to use it, it was an amazing hold and</li>
      <li>I keep this in the office and it comes in handy.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product for my type hair, viz: unmanageable and straight</li>
      <li>The product seems to work good and it smells much better than women&#x27;s hairspray.</li>
      <li>Hold is great and dries quickly which is a must.</li>
      <li>It was fine to use, but I put it in my trunk when I was traveling, and the spray somehow leaked and everything inside came out!</li>
      <li>Works well and smells appropriate for a man.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this stuff for my husband and toddler son.</li>
      <li>But, I was able to use it once</li>
      <li>It has a very strong hold, but a fine mist when it is sprayed.</li>
      <li>Very clean.  </li>
      <li>The twist-style top gave out and now I have full can of hairspray that I can&#x27;t use.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own thing in certain spots.</li>
      <li>Smells pretty great actually, decent hold, not sticky.</li>
      <li>And the smell is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Product is good, but spraying mechanism needs to be fixed.</li>
      <li>Some did better than others, but nothing compares to actual salon-quality hairspray, honestly.</li>
      <li>guess is the gas pressure inside the canister finishes waaaaay before the product does, so although the can is full of product, there is no way of spraying it out.</li>
      <li>The can is completely full.</li>
      <li>Quality product and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Great for strong hold without making your hair look greasy or making it hard.</li>
      <li>It worked great, but the fragrance was a little too perfume-like for my taste.</li>
      <li>(not that I care that much since shipping was free, but still).</li>
      <li>Hairspray works well, smells good, lasts long and doesn&#x27;t require a lot applied to work, and is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Smells a little more masculine and hold hair in place while giving a nice shine.  </li>
      <li>This hairspray works very well!</li>
      <li>The smell is okay, not fantastic, but dries very quickly.</li>
      <li>Used maybe 3 or 4 times and it stopped spraying with the can completely still full.</li>
      <li>(Trust me, I&#x27;m laughing writing this review just as much as you are reading it.)     </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve already used some of it, so I guess I&#x27;ll just see if my Grandma wants it.</li>
      <li>my hair wants to do</li>
      <li>It works for about several days before the can just stops spraying, although it is almost full.</li>
      <li>and I live in a very humid climate.</li>
      <li>It starts to look less \\&quot;done\\&quot;, for lack of a better term.</li>
      <li>If you need something that will keep your hair rocking steady without having to deal with all the gook.</li>
      <li>Smells good, but not sure if this is actually holding my hair very well.</li>
      <li>It has a very &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; hold, meaning it wont make you look like you have a helmet-hair, no sheen or shine at all, so your hair looks perfectly natural.</li>
      <li>Used 4-5 times until the head piece got stuck and spray wouldn&#x27;t come out, so I had to throw away a brand new bottle.</li>
      <li>It holds up better than any other hairspray for their hair!!!</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time this has happened to me, so beware, if you want to pay for a product that works for several days and then just stops, go ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That was the first thing I thought of the second</li>
      <li>It has a nice subtle (not overpowering) masculine fragrance.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and strong hold without the crazy weight of most hairspray.</li>
      <li>I love this product, I have had a hard time finding it at the salons, they always seem to be out.</li>
      <li>I used TIGI Hard Head hairspray as an experiment after getting my haircut, as the lovely lady who cut my hair was styling it for me, I asked her to use the hairspray to finish it off</li>
      <li>This was also supposed to be a Prime item, yet it took nearly two weeks to arrive</li>
      <li>Spray will spew out wildly at times with globs of hair spray.</li>
      <li>The bottle is pretty small, but you don&#x27;t need very much of it.</li>
      <li>holds really well for a long time</li>
      <li>No real complaints to think of although when the product was first received it seemed to take a bit to get it going.</li>
      <li>By the end of the day, my hair had lost most of its volume and curl due to being weighed down by the hairspray.</li>
      <li>Another major bonus is that this product (Bed Head by TIGI) does not test on animals.</li>
      <li>I think they have some major quality control issues.</li>
      <li>Every bit as potent and tear-jerking as you remember from sitting behind a row of old ladies at church, squinting because the aroma was so grating it actually made your eyes hurt.</li>
      <li>The problem however, is that 99% of aerosol type sprays are clearly designed to attract the fairer sex since they usually smell much like my grandma&#x27;s perfume.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cap gets crusty residue on it sometimes and makes it spray crooked and messy, but just needs to be cleaned off.&lt;br /&gt;Other than needing a better cap design, this holds well and has a great manly scent to it.</li>
    <li> Spray accumulates by the nozzle. Sometimes doesn&#x27;t spray correctly.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I feel a bit ridiculous writing a review for hairspray but it&#x27;s definitely needed. I&#x27;m a guy with relatively thick hair. Although I use American Crew Fiber to actually style it, as the day goes on (just using American Crew Fiber) my hair wants to do it&#x27;s own thing in certain spots. It starts to look less \\&quot;done\\&quot;, for lack of a better term. This is why I always try to cover my head with a finishing spray of some sort. The problem however, is that 99% of aerosol type sprays are clearly designed to attract the fairer sex since they usually smell much like my grandma&#x27;s perfume. This is different. It has a nice subtle (not overpowering) masculine fragrance. It holds up to humidity and keeps my faux-hawk in check for 12+ hours. (Trust me, I&#x27;m laughing writing this review just as much as you are reading it.)     Another major bonus is that this product (Bed Head by TIGI) does not test on animals. I&#x27;m very careful to buy from companies that don&#x27;t believe a rabbit needs to have  products dripped into its eye until it goes blind, all while kept in restraints as it shrieks from the pain. Or a dog (usually a beagle) is force fed large quantities until it dies.</li>
    <li> Quality product and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff for my husband and toddler son. It holds up better than any other hairspray for their hair!!!</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised and will reorder again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and strong hold without the crazy weight of most hairspray. Definitely will reorder.</li>
    <li> It was fine to use, but I put it in my trunk when I was traveling, and the spray somehow leaked and everything inside came out! I only used it less than five times! It also ruined my clothes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong this product is amazing, but the functionality of it is HORRIBLE! It works for about several days before the can just stops spraying, although it is almost full. This isn&#x27;t the first time this has happened to me, so beware, if you want to pay for a product that works for several days and then just stops, go ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is the gas pressure inside the canister finishes waaaaay before the product does, so although the can is full of product, there is no way of spraying it out.</li>
    <li> Great for strong hold without making your hair look greasy or making it hard.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair and I live in a very humid climate. So, I started using hairspray a couple years ago to help keep my hair in check throughout the day. Some did better than others, but nothing compares to actual salon-quality hairspray, honestly. I used TIGI Hard Head hairspray as an experiment after getting my haircut, as the lovely lady who cut my hair was styling it for me, I asked her to use the hairspray to finish it off so I could test it out. It worked great, but the fragrance was a little too perfume-like for my taste. I&#x27;d used Bed Head products for men (shampoo, conditioner, etc.) in the past and came across this hairspray here on Amazon and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW! This stuff is absolutely perfect for my use. It has a very &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; hold, meaning it wont make you look like you have a helmet-hair, no sheen or shine at all, so your hair looks perfectly natural. And the smell is fantastic. I&#x27;d almost wear a cologne that has this fragrance. Very clean.  Just really great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good-holding, no gloss hairspray that doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers and candy, this is your ticket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED: Removing a star from a previous 5-star rating. The last can I received stopped dispensing almost immediately. The twist-style top gave out and now I have full can of hairspray that I can&#x27;t use. Please fix this, TIGI!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have had a hard time finding it at the salons, they always seem to be out.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Smells a little more masculine and hold hair in place while giving a nice shine.  Do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my type hair, viz: unmanageable and straight as pump water ! Only downside is that the nozzle often claggs up and needs to be vigorously cleaned out !!</li>
    <li> I keep this in the office and it comes in handy.  Hold is great and dries quickly which is a must.</li>
    <li> Loved the spray until the spray bottle stopped working. Used 4-5 times until the head piece got stuck and spray wouldn&#x27;t come out, so I had to throw away a brand new bottle. Not sure if I should buy a second one. Shame.</li>
    <li> Hairspray works well, smells good, lasts long and doesn&#x27;t require a lot applied to work, and is reasonably priced. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, Nice scent.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but not sure if this is actually holding my hair very well. I usually use this as a finish after using pomade or wax but I never notice a difference if I spray or not spray; my thick hair seems to go down at the same time regardless.</li>
    <li> Smells manly, holds well and isn&#x27;t flaky. Good stuff. No real complaints to think of although when the product was first received it seemed to take a bit to get it going.</li>
    <li> Does the job well, and helps my hair keep its form throughout the day (I also play/move my hair often, which affects the hold)</li>
    <li> malfunctioning bottle, never got to use the product</li>
    <li> It could be that I received a different product than other reviewers who talked this stuff up big time. If you&#x27;ve got shaggy/wavy hair like me, expect this to do the job for maybe half the day. By the end of the day, my hair had lost most of its volume and curl due to being weighed down by the hairspray. And as if that weren&#x27;t annoying enough, let&#x27;s talk about the worst part -- don&#x27;t be fooled by reviewers claiming this stuff smells good (let alone smells like nothing at all). It REEKS. Like Grandma&#x27;s hair on Sunday morning. That was the first thing I thought of the second I got a whiff of it. Every bit as potent and tear-jerking as you remember from sitting behind a row of old ladies at church, squinting because the aroma was so grating it actually made your eyes hurt. Definitely not a smart purchase. This was also supposed to be a Prime item, yet it took nearly two weeks to arrive (not that I care that much since shipping was free, but still). I&#x27;d send it back for a refund but I&#x27;ve already used some of it, so I guess I&#x27;ll just see if my Grandma wants it.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair spray for men. It applies evenly and holds all day.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look or feel stiff.  It was shipped promptly and received in excellent condition and in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Good product. Works well and smells appropriate for a man. My wife likes the smell too. The package arrived in 3 days which was good.</li>
    <li> I had this product for about a week before the rotating head decided to start getting stuck whenever I tried opening it. Once this started happening, the spray started coming out slower and slower until finally nothing at all. The time I did get to use it, it was an amazing hold and exactly what I wanted, sadly, I have about 3/4 of the can left and continue to push the sprayer with nothing coming out.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews - major design flaw.  I am a verified purchase - three of four cans of this product (which is absolutely awesome when it works, btw) were defective.  I ended up throwing away at least half of the can each time.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty great actually, decent hold, not sticky. Not as tough of a hold as I had hoped, but not bad when combined with other products.</li>
    <li> Works great. The smell is okay, not fantastic, but dries very quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is stiff, and it smells divine. The bottle is pretty small, but you don&#x27;t need very much of it.</li>
    <li> Spray will spew out wildly at times with globs of hair spray. Product is good, but spraying mechanism needs to be fixed. This happens with EVERY bottle I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> Not a nice fragrance, wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> holds really well for a long time</li>
    <li> Hey guys, I know what your thinking: I am way too manly to ever be caught using a women&#x27;s hair product. Well, let me tell you, this is no women&#x27;s hair product. No frilly smells, no glitter and glitz, just performance. Gel is gross. If you need something that will keep your hair rocking steady without having to deal with all the gook. This will do the job.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work good and it smells much better than women&#x27;s hairspray. But, I was able to use it once and now it wont spray. The can is completely full. I think they have some major quality control issues. This was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> This hairspray works very well! It has a very strong hold, but a fine mist when it is sprayed. This allows you to get good coverage without over applying. I use it on my medium length hair and prefer it over the Bed Head hairspray I had used before.</li>
    <li> Horrible product design. Used maybe 3 or 4 times and it stopped spraying with the can completely still full. Waste of money buying this. No way to spray it out now.</li>
</ol>
