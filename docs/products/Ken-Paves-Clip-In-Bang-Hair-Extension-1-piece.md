      <li>I would gladly spend more money on a hair peice if it is quality.</li>

      <li>However, the package says that you can curl the hair and I wasn&#x27;t able to do this.</li>
      <li>I love bangs but don&#x27;t always want them.</li>
      <li>I like the bang clip on and it looks ok</li>
      <li>Great match and fits really snug</li>
      <li>so I am pleased</li>
      <li>My hair is wavy and it doesn&#x27;t look right without straightening my own hair.</li>

      <li>They r really easy to use and manage</li>
      <li>Easy to clip in and blend with my hair.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a more full bang when I purchased this.  </li>
      <li>The long hair extensions are gorgeous and bend beautifully between my real hair.     </li>
      <li>The bang look so real, it´s so easy to use and looks and feels to the touch truly like your own hair.</li>
      <li>Bangs are a huge committment</li>
      <li>it didnt fit the shape of my head, so I had to trim it, and it looked off from the rest of my hair.</li>
      <li>These were FANTASTIC for my friend who had an aneurysm.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy holding them on my cat&#x27;s head.</li>
      <li>Gave it a four star because even if the color matches your hair color, it will shine if fervently under light.  </li>
      <li>Super easy to clip in ..</li>
      <li>Sounds funny considering I&#x27;m clipping bangs onto the front top of my head.</li>
      <li>Very happy with my new band it looks so real and natural.</li>
      <li>I had to spend a great deal of time looking at other sites and pictures though, as the color descriptions and pictures on Amazon are not user friendly.</li>
      <li>They are so cheaply made it wasn&#x27;t even worth the price.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 10 year old granddaughter who wanted bangs, but wasn&#x27;t allowed to cut her own hair.  </li>
      <li>Bangs look very natural, and they are very easy to take on and off.  </li>
      <li>never was able to make it look realistic.</li>
      <li>not that easy to put in and does not flow with real hair</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, I actually gave to my cousin who is a cosmatogilist, in hopes she&#x27;d be able to do something with it!</li>
      <li>I am thinking of getting a backup just in case because it could take months before my own hair grows back in.</li>
      <li>It was the same color that my own hair.</li>
      <li>This product is really fun.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised that these synthetic bangs looked so cute and fun.  </li>
      <li>Not a lot of money for some fun hair.</li>
      <li>There WAS NOT.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an odd, ashy shade of light-ish brown that most certainly won&#x27;t blend into my own hair.</li>
      <li>I have worn these bangs a few times and got great reviews from family and friends almost same color as my own colored hair just a bit darker but can&#x27;t even tell so much.</li>
      <li>I have since gotten a few more pieces from her line and love them all.</li>
      <li>I have light brown (natural/not dyed) hair with some natural highlights from the sun and</li>
      <li>I just got this to have some fun but to my surprise these bangs look real.  </li>
      <li>Everyone believes they are real!</li>
      <li>Have to play with it when you first put it in.  </li>
      <li>Since these were not expensive, I gave them a try.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would look shiny and plasticky but not at all, it looks completely real to me!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;However, it did ship fast!</li>
      <li>Covering the clip with head bands doesn&#x27;t really work either.&lt;br /&gt;Bummer !</li>
      <li>They came looking very creased and even after trying to straighten and brush them out I can&#x27;t get them to look right.</li>
      <li>She liked that they were a little too long for her which gave her the opportunity to do her own trimming.  </li>
      <li>These bangs really do look and feel like real hair!</li>
      <li>these are so fun to play with and have bangs without the commitment I have received lots of complements on them and people cant believe they are fake great price too</li>
      <li>I really wanted these to work.</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t spend much time trying to adjust them since I wasn&#x27;t going to wear the piece for any lenght of time).  </li>
      <li>Haha...</li>
      <li>and they look real.</li>
      <li>but my real hair is just as shiny.  </li>
      <li>These add thickness and blend very well.  </li>
      <li>so I can really wear them.  </li>
      <li>Too much hair and don&#x27;t look real looks like a bob cut if u want justin bieber hair do then get it I will give a zero</li>
      <li>Ive never had bangs my whole life.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t match my hair color and the clip is VERY noticeable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very disappointed - the small clips are very painful on my head. Aside from the pain , the bangs looked good. The color was darker than I expected, but I just dyed my hair to match the bangs.</li>
    <li> Bangs look very natural, and they are very easy to take on and off.  I only wish the bangs were a little less shiny, but that is how most all hairpieces tend to be...to shiny.</li>
    <li> These were FANTASTIC for my friend who had an aneurysm. She had brain surgery and was self conscious about her scar, the worked perfectly for her and the match was lovely. These were really top quality too, the best you can get without buying real hair!</li>
    <li> This is very nice hair and very easy to use.  I love this piece!  I have since gotten a few more pieces from her line and love them all. Amazon has got the best prices for them too!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Not quite a match to my hair color</li>
    <li> The bang look so real, it´s so easy to use and looks and feels to the touch truly like your own hair. The only problem is \\&quot;Strawberry blonde\\&quot; was a fairer color in comparison with a previous hair extension I&#x27;ve purchased time ago and looks much more like a shade with my real hair, which is darker.   The long hair extensions are gorgeous and bend beautifully between my real hair.     Great product, however. If I ever get a lighter hair colour, of course I will go for it.</li>
    <li> perfect match to my ponytail hair piece.  I love bangs but don&#x27;t always want them.</li>
    <li> Love them! They were a little darker than my original hair, but my hair lightens in the summer, so I sprayed a little baby powder on the bangs to lighten them up when needed. Everyone believes they are real! Super easy to clip in ..just make sure you don&#x27;t put them too far back on your scalp and that you trim the bottoms if needed so you don&#x27;t have to push them to the side and let everyone see where they are clipped in. Overall worth the money- that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> These are great.  I fried my bangs with a flat iron and had almost nothing.  Was getting tired of wearing hats.  Since these were not expensive, I gave them a try.  Omg.,,they are great.  I wore them to my hairstylist so she could trim them a bit and she thought my bangs had grown back in.  So they fooled her.  Even though my hair is highlighted, It blended in nicely....you really can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s fake.  Looks exactly like my old bangs.  I am thinking of getting a backup just in case because it could take months before my own hair grows back in. Have to play with it when you first put it in.  I highly recommend if you are in need of a temporary fix or just for a different look.</li>
    <li> Too much hair and don&#x27;t look real looks like a bob cut if u want justin bieber hair do then get it I will give a zero</li>
    <li> I like the bang clip on and it looks ok but I don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t do anything to style it.  You can&#x27;t use a straightener on it and it won&#x27;t take a curl, it just lays flat.  My hair is wavy and it doesn&#x27;t look right without straightening my own hair. I should have done a little more research before purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Ive never had bangs my whole life. This is the coolest thing ever. Looks so natural too it&#x27;s weird. Tha color matched also.</li>
    <li> The color matched my hair perfect! I had to spend a great deal of time looking at other sites and pictures though, as the color descriptions and pictures on Amazon are not user friendly. The price is though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviews indicated, brushing with a little bit of cornstarch helped take away the &amp;#34;fake looking shine.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m going to take these in next time I get a hair cut and my my hairdresser cut them as they feel a bit long to me, but maybe I&#x27;m just not used to bangs in my eyes. This product is really fun.</li>
    <li> They came looking very creased and even after trying to straighten and brush them out I can&#x27;t get them to look right. I haven&#x27;t even worn them out. If you&#x27;re getting this because you are thinking of bangs and just want to see how they look before making the commitment but don&#x27;t plan to wear these regularly, just take some of your own hair and bobby pin it in such a way that it makes bangs, looks silly but good enough to give you an idea of how bangs would look without making the permanent cut or wasting money.</li>
    <li> Hmmm... Not very functional or realistic. Sounds funny considering I&#x27;m clipping bangs onto the front top of my head. Haha...The clips that attach to your hair are weak and too few. I&#x27;d have to almost clip them in on the back of my head because they&#x27;re so large. I have thick hair and had a hard time figuring out what to do with my hair underneath this bang piece as it covers a large area on top of my head. Guess that works for those with larger foreheads. I gave them a good go but I never walked outside of the house with them on. I really wanted these to work.</li>
    <li> The color was a bit off and I found it difficult to put in. I also don&#x27;t advise wearing it if its at all windy</li>
    <li> Nice if you can find the right shade and if you do know how to wear it.. Mine was a total waste.</li>
    <li> Got the &amp;#34;ginger brown&amp;#34; color. They&#x27;re a little lighter than the rest of my light brown hair, but close enough. Really fun way to have realistic looking bangs without taking the plunge and cutting. I also enjoy holding them on my cat&#x27;s head. Perfect size for a cat wig. :)</li>
    <li> very difficult to use, no instructions on how to clip in I returned it</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about whether or not the color would match up...but it&#x27;s pretty perfect. I have light brown (natural/not dyed) hair with some natural highlights from the sun and this color was a great match. Bangs are a huge committment so it&#x27;s nice to be able to wear them every once in a while.</li>
    <li> I have worn these bangs a few times and got great reviews from family and friends almost same color as my own colored hair just a bit darker but can&#x27;t even tell so much. I have even washed it and it still looks good.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product, colors matched perfect. I have a touch of grey and as soon I got&lt;br /&gt;my hair blended with the bangs perfect! My friends love it! So do I.</li>
    <li> I was VERY disappointed when I opened this package. The box was not like the one shown in the picture. The box did not even have Jessica Simpson on it. When I opened the box the color was not as I expected but I could have managed IF the product would have been even close to what I had imagined. The hair itself was very frizzy and rough, not at all smooth. It was very thin as well and looked un-natural. I realize that this is a fake hair product, but who wants to have an obvious fake hair peice? Not this girl. I should have picked up on the fact that it wouldn&#x27;t be what I expected due to the cost. I would gladly spend more money on a hair peice if it is quality. This was not. I returned it for a refund.</li>
    <li> does not blend well with hair... you can TELL you are wearing a piece.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t wear this. :( It doesn&#x27;t match my hair color and the clip is VERY noticeable. I would have to tease my hair like crazy to try to cover the clip. Covering the clip with head bands doesn&#x27;t really work either.&lt;br /&gt;Bummer !&lt;br /&gt;However, it did ship fast!</li>
    <li> Not good for minorities or people with smaller heads. it didnt fit the shape of my head, so I had to trim it, and it looked off from the rest of my hair. didnt look real.</li>
    <li> So cute!  Easy to clip in and blend with my hair.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my new band it looks so real and natural.It was the same color that my own hair.It was very easy to clip it on.It was delivery so fast, LOVE AMAZON never have  a problem!!!</li>
    <li> These bangs really do look and feel like real hair! I&#x27;m just not sure how to style them without ruining them. The hair wants to go straight down, and I can&#x27;t figure out how to tease it to the side...</li>
    <li> I  bought this for a Halloween costume and it worked out well. However, the package says that you can curl the hair and I wasn&#x27;t able to do this. (I was trying to curl the longer pieces to blend with my hair.) So, I just ended up clipping those pieces back underneath the rest of my hair.</li>
    <li> The name of tho colour indicated there was red shading in it. There WAS NOT.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an odd, ashy shade of light-ish brown that most certainly won&#x27;t blend into my own hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars not 5 because it does need to be trimmed, I got mine trimmed at a salon and now it looks great. I was really surprised with how real the hair looks! I thought it would look shiny and plasticky but not at all, it looks completely real to me! I chose r6 dark brown it was the perfect color for me.</li>
    <li> Gave it a four star because even if the color matches your hair color, it will shine if fervently under light.  But considering the cost, it is a great deal!</li>
    <li> Great match and fits really snug</li>
    <li> never was able to make it look realistic. waste of money since it is not returnable.</li>
    <li> The most satisfying experience doing business with this merchant. Highly recommend purchasing fr this person. The bangs r such a hit and I love them. They r really easy to use and manage and they look real. Perfect for blending.</li>
    <li> My natural bangs are too thin. These add thickness and blend very well.  I couldn&#x27;t do without them!  They look great with a headband, a ponytail or a hat too!</li>
    <li> People thought I had actually gotten my hair cut! The color matched perfectly and it was also comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> I ended up throwing this out. They are so cheaply made it wasn&#x27;t even worth the price. The bangs are way too long and I have to clip it in so far back on my head, it&#x27;s almost dead center.</li>
    <li> I just got this to have some fun but to my surprise these bangs look real.  I am growing my bangs out and have been considering cutting them to a full bang like this so it is nice to wear it and get the feel of bangs, without cutting my hair.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, I actually gave to my cousin who is a cosmatogilist, in hopes she&#x27;d be able to do something with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 10 year old granddaughter who wanted bangs, but wasn&#x27;t allowed to cut her own hair.  She liked that they were a little too long for her which gave her the opportunity to do her own trimming.  So cute, but not permanent.</li>
    <li> The clip bangs by Jessica Simpson is just amazing ,  the color of the bangs blends perfectly with the color of my hair, nobody notice that I have it.&lt;br /&gt;The money i paid is wort it every hair !!! and more. Good product, amazing quality. I highly recommend it !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The color is nothing like it looked on the internet. I ordered ginger brown but it&#x27;s more of a ginger. They would be adorable if my hair was actually the same color!</li>
    <li> Does not look that great, looks really fake too. like synthetic hair. not that easy to put in and does not flow with real hair</li>
    <li> these are so fun to play with and have bangs without the commitment I have received lots of complements on them and people cant believe they are fake great price too I have seen these at the store go for 30 or more so I am pleased</li>
    <li> I was expecting a more full bang when I purchased this.  It kind of looks fake, and I have yet to actually wear it.</li>
    <li> I feel like my hair is thining and I wanted to try a cheap set of bangs to see what I might look like with some fake hair.  I was really surprised that these synthetic bangs looked so cute and fun.  Sadly they dont match my hair color but I might order a darker color so I can really wear them.  They have three clips that hold tight.  However I found the clips to be painful (I didn&#x27;t spend much time trying to adjust them since I wasn&#x27;t going to wear the piece for any lenght of time).  All of that aside the hair looked real on my head.  It was shiny but my real hair is just as shiny.  They are a bit long but I imagine you could trim them a bit if needed.  They made me look like I had full and thick hair...it made me sad to take it of and see my thin hair in comparison.  Not a lot of money for some fun hair.</li>
