<ol>
      <li>My curls are so happy now!</li>
      <li>It is wonderful!</li>
      <li>Wonderful comb.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>This comb fits well in my travel purse, smells wonderful, and works well on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise the design is excellent.</li>
      <li>It also got coated with some hair oil accidentally and now does a wonderful job of redistributing that oil in the hair without turning it greasy.</li>
      <li>The wood is attractive, feels good in the hand, and looks good on the dresser.</li>
      <li>The recipient of this mom&#x27;s day gift was delighted.</li>
      <li>Feels good on my scalp and doesn&#x27;t snag my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good size.</li>
      <li>This one is really good.</li>
      <li>The comb is very nice - I would have preferred it with more sandalwood scent - but still very nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>It is beautiful and strong.</li>
      <li>but I will be buying an additional one like this for my own longer hair.</li>
      <li>Nice and sturdy.</li>
      <li>It is also the most comfortable comb I have ever used, and it is beautiful as well.</li>
      <li>this comb does a wonderful job of detangling (requires more gentle handling than a brush).</li>
      <li>That said it is a lovely, sturdy comb</li>
      <li>Calm, smooth, happy hair.</li>
      <li>These are even better than boar bristle brushes at controlling static.</li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>We love the look and feel.</li>
      <li>More like, she likes it.</li>
      <li>then this is fine comb.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable in the hand while using three fingers to hold it and</li>
      <li>Wood is smooth and fits even in my purse.</li>
      <li>one is much better than those I saw in Walmart, but still not so good as Chinese products...</li>
      <li>nothing special but feels sturdy and well made.</li>
      <li>Overall I have to say that it&#x27;s a good comb.</li>
      <li>However I ordered this as a gift for my father for Father&#x27;s Day because a different Sandalwood comb I have smells so good.</li>
      <li>She has fine, straight hair and</li>
      <li>Solid, nice design that doesn&#x27;t seem like it will break unless abused...</li>
      <li>It has a nice solid handle.</li>
      <li>I had looked all through Amazon and in the drug stores for a wooden comb since all this winter my hair has been full of static.</li>
      <li>I LOVE WOODEN COMBS.</li>
      <li>The comb arrived and looks and feels exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>I love to give wooden combs Nd</li>
      <li>Really bad-one time I was having fun playing with my hair by holding my hands about three inches away from each side of my head and watching my hair stand straight out.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really describe it.  </li>
      <li>I live in the Southwest and purchased this comb in hopes that it would help with the static caused by the intensely dry conditions here it did not.</li>
      <li>Anyway, this is the comb I chose and while it does not completely stop the static every day, there has been a marked improvement.</li>
      <li>I was confident that this come would last long and be large enough for comfortable use for an older parent.</li>
      <li>I never noticed static in any of my previous brushes</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Wood combs are really strong too -- I used my last one for over 25 years until a tooth finally broke.</li>
      <li>The quality of the wood also feels pretty solid.</li>
      <li>One because of their unique nature and craftsmanship and the other their symbolism of taking care of on&#x27;s self and not to mention their history that comes with the comb.</li>
      <li>This took a long time to arrive but the quality was worth the wait.  </li>
      <li>But look for  one at a local store first since you can&#x27;t have  control over obtuse handling &amp; shipment preparations.</li>
      <li>Such a large claim for a hair comb.</li>
      <li>It is gentle and wooden combs</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else in my 3 year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>BUT it is not static free as advertised.</li>
      <li>Nicely made but only for a baby or very small child!</li>
      <li>It really does tame frizz from my straight long hair and sure enough no static or snapping like plastic does to hair.</li>
      <li>The handle is a little too short for a completely comfortable grip, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
      <li>Shipped to me fast than expected.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not suitable for anyone with lots of hair or curls and probably should not be used to detangle most wet hair because it will pull.</li>
      <li>Anyway, this design is slightly curve to conform with the scalp, it feels even better than my previous flat wood comb.  </li>
      <li>It also arrived very fast, within a few days after I ordered it here.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The comb arrived and looks and feels exactly as pictured. However I ordered this as a gift for my father for Father&#x27;s Day because a different Sandalwood comb I have smells so good. I thought my dad would appreciate the feel and the scent. When it got here it doesn&#x27;t smell like Sandalwood at all. If anything it has a plasticy type smell that I guess must be caused by the finish. I don&#x27;t know what the finish is; I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s some type of lacquer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want this comb just for the look and that it&#x27;s made of wood then this is fine comb. If you also want it to have that spicy, cinnamon, woodsy smell of Sandalwood, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. Maybe I just got unlucky and mine isn&#x27;t representative but I&#x27;m not recommending this nor would I reorder this comb for anyone else.</li>
    <li> Nicely made but only for a baby or very small child!</li>
    <li> This one is really good. I tried it and then bought it for my mom and brother.I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful! Feels good on my scalp and doesn&#x27;t snag my hair. It has a nice solid handle. Wonderful comb. Shipped to me fast than expected.</li>
    <li> This took a long time to arrive but the quality was worth the wait.  I have been looking for a wooden comb for years.  Glad I now have a source.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money, it only last a few money for a comb that worth $18, let alone no fragrance as described. The comb just started chipping off from the head to the teeth and finally the handle.</li>
    <li> The recipient of this mom&#x27;s day gift was delighted. But my coworker that know about the wood source say the tree used is endangered. Will look for those made with local oak, maple and cherry for future studies of biodegradable grooming products. I was confident that this come would last long and be large enough for comfortable use for an older parent.</li>
    <li> More like, she likes it. Overall I have to say that it&#x27;s a good comb. Solid, nice design that doesn&#x27;t seem like it will break unless abused...but you don&#x27;t have to treat it like paper thin glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping exceeded expectations - as this is coming in from overseas, I thought it&#x27;d be 30-90 days, even with Prime. Nope, just a week.</li>
    <li> Cannot get wood comb in the US malls... I miss the ones I used in China.&lt;br /&gt;This one is much better than those I saw in Walmart, but still not so good as Chinese products...</li>
    <li> I do like this comb BUT it is not static free as advertised. I live in the Southwest and purchased this comb in hopes that it would help with the static caused by the intensely dry conditions here it did not. That said it is a lovely, sturdy comb and I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is the packaging, it was shipped in a simple padded envelope and got cracked during shipping so that one toot was cracked and needed some sanding to repair.</li>
    <li> The teeth of this comb are closer together than I realized from the picture. It&#x27;s not suitable for anyone with lots of hair or curls and probably should not be used to detangle most wet hair because it will pull. Otherwise the design is excellent. The wood is attractive, feels good in the hand, and looks good on the dresser.</li>
    <li> This comb fits well in my travel purse, smells wonderful, and works well on my hair.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Nice and sturdy. Thick. The handle is a little too short for a completely comfortable grip, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. It&#x27;s a good size. Handles my thick hair like a champ. Looks just like the picture. Doesn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood  - nor anything else.</li>
    <li> The comb itself is veritably sandalwood. I know although the aroma is faint. The comb was almost all that I hoped for.  It is comfortable in the hand while using three fingers to hold it and the pointer finger to guide it through hair.  It is gentle and wooden combs I would recommend over a conventional plastic one for someone with a sensitive scalp.it would be durable but in my case there is a split in wood at the  end farthest from handle. The thick wooden stub at the end is split. It came to me this way and this is why I&#x27;ve rated  it low.( EEtrade was the seller) would I still recommend this comb? Yes.  But look for  one at a local store first since you can&#x27;t have  control over obtuse handling &amp; shipment preparations.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for me. Wood is smooth and fits even in my purse. I threw out all my plastic combs.  I have ordered wooden brush and long comb to keep at home. It really does tame frizz from my straight long hair and sure enough no static or snapping like plastic does to hair.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;m using a work of art when I use this comb. It is beautiful and strong. When I use plastic combs, my hair breaks off and I get split ends. Wood combs are really strong too -- I used my last one for over 25 years until a tooth finally broke. This one seems even stronger than that one, and I expect to use this for a long time.</li>
    <li> It took us about 2-3 days to get used to it but I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else in my 3 year old&#x27;s hair. She has fine, straight hair and this comb does a wonderful job of detangling (requires more gentle handling than a brush). It also got coated with some hair oil accidentally and now does a wonderful job of redistributing that oil in the hair without turning it greasy. So, that was an accidental bonus. We have all switched to wooden combs in our family but I will be buying an additional one like this for my own longer hair. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The comb is very nice - I would have preferred it with more sandalwood scent - but still very nice.</li>
    <li> I just like the feel of wood comb on my scalp.  I can&#x27;t really describe it.  Anyway, this design is slightly curve to conform with the scalp, it feels even better than my previous flat wood comb.  The quality of the wood also feels pretty solid.</li>
    <li> I had a friend recommend wooden combs to me saying it changed her life. Such a large claim for a hair comb. It&#x27;s been a few months now and I must say...I LOVE WOODEN COMBS. I never noticed static in any of my previous brushes so I didn&#x27;t think it was a problem. But one use, literally one, and I immediately felt a change. Calm, smooth, happy hair. These are even better than boar bristle brushes at controlling static. My curls are so happy now! I noticed minor roughness in-between the teeth and sometimes it would snag my hair, but not often enough to ruin the usage of the comb.</li>
    <li> I got this comb for my son and he loves it, he often walks around with it combing his hair. We love the look and feel.</li>
    <li> I love to give wooden combs Nd have or will give to all my friends.  One because of their unique nature and craftsmanship and the other their symbolism of taking care of on&#x27;s self and not to mention their history that comes with the comb.</li>
    <li> I had looked all through Amazon and in the drug stores for a wooden comb since all this winter my hair has been full of static. Really bad-one time I was having fun playing with my hair by holding my hands about three inches away from each side of my head and watching my hair stand straight out. Anyway, this is the comb I chose and while it does not completely stop the static every day, there has been a marked improvement. It is also the most comfortable comb I have ever used, and it is beautiful as well. It also arrived very fast, within a few days after I ordered it here. The price is less than others I looked at. You cannot go wrong with this comb. (Also, I am just a fan, not an employee of the maker/sales staff.)</li>
    <li> nothing special but feels sturdy and well made.</li>
