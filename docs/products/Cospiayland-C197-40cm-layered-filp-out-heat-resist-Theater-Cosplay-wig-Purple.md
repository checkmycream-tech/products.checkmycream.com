<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping. This wig is adorable. I love the vibrant colors! It took me a minute to figure out which part was the front, and I had to trim the bangs back a bit, but overall it&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  Okay for $6.00.  I did not like the beige netting.  I think it should be a darker color for when the wind blows the hair.  The cap fitted small.</li>
    <li> Does not look as good as pictured.</li>
    <li> Very fun wig. it fits well, and it soft. i wore it for an anime convention and had a lot of fun. one thing though is that it is very static-y..... but i enjoy this wig</li>
    <li> Love the color...definitely made for a bigger head than mine</li>
    <li> Love this doo!  Great cut that is stylish on its own and can be styled differently.  Good hair texture, not heavy and nice deep purple color.  I was not disapointed by this purchase, oh yes and bonus amazing price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not styled exactly like it is in the picture, but easily fixable. The color is perfect and the hair looks very realistic.</li>
    <li> Was to small for my adult size head and the cut was not like the picture.</li>
    <li> Great color, good fit.</li>
    <li> came fast. a little small and shorter than it looks in picture.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed! The length of the wig is much shorter than pictured. The hair barely reaches below my ears. The wig appeared more pink than violet too. No wonder the price of the wig is so cheap. I would not recommend this wig. You&#x27;ll just waste your money if you purchase it.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly great looking for such a low price!  I&#x27;m happy to say that the wig looks exactly like it does in the pic!</li>
    <li> This wig is great! It&#x27;s well made, easy to style, and fun to wear!</li>
    <li> Used with a Halloween net part to hold the wefts in, , but the seller was nice enough for a return and such. Not a wig for cosplaying in, but for a costume party it would be alright for the night.</li>
    <li> Amazing wig! I bought this for just wearing around but when I put it on I realized it would be perfect for a Mizore cosplay! So I think I&#x27;ll be using it for that as well. The wig comes styled. The bangs are perfect and the layers fan out like they should. I really love this wig and it was a great deal too. I would recommend buying it from the seller Oneplus if you want the bangs already styled. All you have to do is just comb it out and put a little hairspray on it to hold. Looks natural and not shiny at all.</li>
    <li> Great color.  I need some practice getting my real hair all hidden but over all I love it!</li>
    <li> It arrived at a decent time, and its soft and shiny, but it&#x27;s not as long as it is pictured. This thing barely covers my ears. The colour is very bright.. But what else did I expect for buying a 6 dollar wig?</li>
    <li> The style is a little shorter than the picture but it&#x27;s still amazing! Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Despite this wig being true to color, it isn&#x27;t consistent in length, and there are hardly any bangs, just hair all around.&lt;br /&gt;But with extremely careful styling, it&#x27;s passable.</li>
    <li> It is a nice wig for the spring and summer. It is trendy.</li>
    <li> out of the bag it doesn&#x27;t look like that ,Im going to have my niece try and match it , If you&#x27;d like to know the results ask</li>
    <li> The wig its cute, looks just like the pictures. The only thing that i didn&#x27;t like was that u had an issue with shipping. It got coded wrong (c.o.d) and i had to pick it  at the post office . But the box they shipped it in was so small the the wig was miss shaped when I opend it. So you have straighten it or reshape wig. Kind of annoying, but other than that great wig.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect wig for playing &amp;#34;mad madam Mim&amp;#34; from Disney&#x27;s the Sword in the Stone. You&#x27;ll just need a hair net to go underneath it to hide your real hair, especially if its long.</li>
    <li> It was super soft and looks just like the one in the picture. You have to trim the bangs, but I don&#x27;t know of any wig that you don&#x27;t have to. Its the same color and it fits very well. It does flip out more than the pictures show, but yea. Its great and so are the people who sell it.</li>
    <li> It is easy to wear and style, and it is a great color. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it out!</li>
    <li> Total: 2.5 stars  Quality: 3.5 Stars  Style: 0 Stars (Wrong Items)  CON: I DID NOT RECEIVE THE ITEM PICTURED. The style I received has a fuller, shorter bang and the back is a shag. mullet style. No matter how much I mess around with it or how I try to style it, ultimately, it looks nothing like the picture. (I&#x27;m a good wig styler!)    I knew I was taking a gamble when ordering this wig, and I waited a while to do so  since previous reviewers stated that they&#x27;d received the wrong item so my case is not unusual. I just thought it was too cute and for the price I figured it worth taking the chance. I mean, is the wrong item the exception or the rule? I am glad that this was not an item I needed and something I was ordering for fun.    PRO: Aside from that it is a good quality wig that I could see people liking because it does not have that rough, thin costumey feel. Nice color and seems durable which I am sure is great for cosplay. Comes with wig cap!    The back is pretty thin compared to the front as the bulk of the hair on wig that I got is in the front. It  is also pretty small. I have a lot of wigs and this is only the 2nd time I have experience this tight, small cap. Basically any wig under $10 has had this problem. As I did with that one,  I will most likely give it away.</li>
    <li> I love this wig!! I got it today and it&#x27;s very soft and fits perfectly. I have long hair and it all fit under the wig cap and didn&#x27;t bulg out. I definitely recommend buying a wig cap though. It looks just like the picture on. The back flips out and has that spikey look in the back it doesn&#x27;t just lay flat. The color is beautiful and true to the picture color! The part in the front looks nice too it blends into my forehead and doesn&#x27;t look like a wig... Well except for the fact that its purple lol prettyland wigs are amazing this is my second one and I am more than satisfied!!!! I definitely recommend this wig!!</li>
    <li> kind of cheap wig... looks nothing like the picture.....</li>
    <li> Cute, but a little short.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this wig before ordering.  Based on the reviews I ordered with an expedited shipping cost so I would receive it by Halloween.  I am disappointed...the only thing I agree with is that the color is a good purple.  The back is not feathered for layered flip out and the sides are not feathered evenly.  The side bang is too severe and when I tried to trim it myself I ended up making it even worse.  This will be thrown away.  Picture is cute but what arrived is no where near what the picture shows!</li>
    <li> A LITTLE bit shiny but nothing a powder bath can&#x27;t undo, personally I don&#x27;t like my wigs too shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty true to that picture though, like spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty thick, very little shedding if any at all, hardly tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good buy, 4/5 though just because I&#x27;m a picky person when it comes to shine.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is going to a cosplay convention in July and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> When I finally got this after waiting way to long I was so disappointed to find that is very thin very shiny and not the same cut as the photo shows. The cut looks like a mullet I am not pleased that I&#x27;ll have to do a lot of tweaking to this wig. Dissatisfied</li>
    <li> Came before estimated delivery date, awesome condition! Color was perfect, doesn&#x27;t shed too much, and fits just right with adjustable straps! Perfect for cosplay! Definitely recommend buying!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft, but it looks nothing like the picture. I wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> I just got this wig in the mail today. I am very disappointed. It looks nothing like the picture, the color was not even close, and it was very thin.</li>
    <li> This product does NOT look like its picture it was very disappointing I will not ever buy another one from here again</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a Future Twilight Sparkle cosplay (I added pink and purple stripes). This wig fit and stayed put. It can be styled - few bald spots. It is a vibrant color and a cute style right out of the bag. This is one you will be wearing around the house anytime you want to feel awesome!</li>
    <li> The color and style are exactly as pictured and it still maintains it&#x27;s flip-out shape! This wig worked great with several cosplays for me, and I even got a compliment on it from Yaya Han, as well as many other cosplayers who said it looked great! That alone makes this the best 10 bucks I ever spent. :)</li>
    <li> Much much shorter than pictured. the wig actually seems to be child&lt;br /&gt; sized. u can get it on but cannot hide my above shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. The wig looks a little different on my head than on the picture, maybe the plastic model has a longer head or something like that. I had to trim it on front, it was in my eyes and had to fix it by hand all the time. I have a small head and not very tall forehead, the wig fits well except that trimming I mentioned. I don&#x27;t know what a high quality wig looks or feels like, I&#x27;ve never had any wig before. This one loses a bit, you might see a little bit of  &amp;#34;purple hair&amp;#34; on your shoulders, clothes, brush...but i bought it because it was cheap and I needed it for fun. Generally it is a cheap but OK wig, looks nice.</li>
    <li> Shorter than what is shown. Cute but need to work at it to make it cute. Need to trim to make it more even since there is a lot of hair on top and less on the bottom. But very soft and will order from them again, just in their longer selections.</li>
    <li> I did recurve the wig. I was very excited to find the wig cap that came with it. Today was the first time I got to premiere it for a teen Titan raven cosplay at Anime Iowa. While I haven&#x27;t had a chance to style it yet, I really like how well it fits and how light it feels. Thank you for such an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Cool color, love the cut, ready to get this BlackLightRun 5K started.</li>
    <li> Great wig that offers nice coverage and some spunky fun for having cancer treatment.</li>
    <li> This was well worth the money! It shipped faster than expected, was comfortable to wear and was the product of a night full of compliments!</li>
    <li> Received two wigs from Prettyland and both are exactly as pictured. Very nice quality and a well designed quality Cosplay wig.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig to use as a fun date night/night on the town wig. I&#x27;ve worn it three times now. It fits well, and it doesn&#x27;t look bad. I&#x27;ve had some trouble with styling it, because it wasn&#x27;t flipped out as it is in the photo. It does have a natural crown ,which is nice. Mine has shed when I&#x27;ve worn it. Not enough to be worried, but enough to be aware of whether or not I&#x27;ve got purple hair on me. I would recommend using a wig brush on it, and wearing a wig cap. It&#x27;s been a fun purchase and I would recommend it for occasional use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the cosplay I was going to do, but when it got here the hair was low quality, the color was a bright purple, and the length was shorter than it was suppose to be. You could say it&#x27;s low quality because I&#x27;m buying this for so cheap, but I have bought lower than $10 wigs before and they ranged from good to great quality. I was hoping to just return it, but I had to get accepted through the people that sold it. I was a little irritated about that, but as long as I get my return I was ok with it. They e-mailed me came back pretty fast, but the person I was talking to tried her best to convince me to keep it when I told her no over and over again. She tried to tell me the shortness of it would be good for summer and the color is just from their &amp;#34;photographic technology&amp;#34; on the picture. Yeah, in other words they use Photoshop to make it look pretty. And if I was worried about how hot the summer would be, I wouldn&#x27;t complain about the length. I honestly think Photoshop is fine to use, but don&#x27;t manipulate your product so much that it changes how it looks completely. I had to eventually come down to telling her &amp;#34;either I get my money back or I won&#x27;t buy from you and I&#x27;ll make sure my friends won&#x27;t either.&amp;#34;, only then would they give me my refund, finally.</li>
    <li> The hair is so soft and shiny and silky.  I love this wig!  It came packaged so careful and nice.</li>
    <li> I ordered the purple, and it&#x27;s a fantastic fun color! the cut is GREAT and looks exactly as shown on the mannequin when it&#x27;s on. The purple is just like the photo. Will definitely order again and try more colors.</li>
    <li> This was a good quality wig for the price, but I think I will never order from this company again. The purple is not a deep purple but a very cartoonish purple and the shape of the wig is not natural at all - very fake and unbelievable. Won&#x27;t be using it unless it&#x27;s halloween and everyone&#x27;s supposed to have obviously fake hair.</li>
    <li> The wig is much shorter than what is pictured and is not styled the same way (I can&#x27;t really see the flips in mine).  overall I am not pleased and wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I knew what it&#x27;d be like.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear wigs often... But this wig is beautiful, well styled, and colored.  I wore it as part of a halloween costume and received compliment after compliment.  Some people that didn&#x27;t know me... Asked if it was my real hair and/would I consider doing my hair in this style AND everyone loved the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be wearing it again.</li>
    <li> This wig is wonderful! It looks so real!! I was concerned with buying a wig online but I made the right choice with this!</li>
    <li> I ordered/purchased this wig for my Halloween costume in mid-September. I thought it would be perfect. My disappointment started shortly thereafter. I received notification that it would not be delivered until sometime in November. So I ended up ordering another wig (which I loved). I did finally receive the wig-before Halloween so I ended up with two purple wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style: Unfortunately, it really didn&#x27;t look much like the picture. Seemed shorter and not styled quite the same. Maybe my head is too big for how it was styled or something.&lt;br /&gt;Fit: Good fit and adjustable-that was nice.&lt;br /&gt;Quality: I wish the style was better because the quality was GREAT! I could not believe how soft it was. I also liked that it didn&#x27;t look super fake like the wigs you get at the Halloween stores or departments. There was probably 2-3 times as much &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; as those for the same price. I really wish it looked better on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: my friend saw this wig and loved it. She could not believe the quality, price or feel. I went ahead and gave it to her and she was thrilled!</li>
    <li> It showed up earlier than I expected and it is everything I expected and hoped for in a cosplay wig.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this wig. It came in a grimy green plastic but had some sturdy cardboard inside, luckily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the color was not like the picture. It was actually quite a bit lighter and more yellow. I thought, all right--it&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s still pretty. I put on the wig cap and put on the wig. It was rather thin and patchy in places. And once it was on, I saw that the stitching was already loose and unraveling. The wig itself was also nearly too small. I guess I have an odd head but when I try to have it cover the wig cap, it rides up too far in the back. If I try to pull it back, you can see the wig cap. The clips on the inside that help keep it snug simply wouldn&#x27;t hold together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall it was a disappointment. I won&#x27;t be getting another wig from this brand again. I got one from Sweet and Happy Girl in green for about the same price and it was incredibly awesome. I&#x27;ll be going back to them.</li>
    <li> product was cool it fit good quality great color , but i expected it to look more feminine the way it looks in shown picture but it looks way shorter and requires styling .... It is cool but i wont be wearing it... HOWEVER, the seller sent the product in a timely manner so i would definitely buy other items , i just wasnt feeling this one</li>
    <li> The color and feel of the hair was great. But it was waaaay shorter than I expected and I don&#x27;t consider myself to have a huge head!  It was more like a pixie cut</li>
    <li> The wig is beautiful but it is shorter than it looks on the display, and a little to thin because the white cape thing in the inside is alittle visible, pretty sure I can fix that, the item came in good time, over all no big problem</li>
    <li> Hey hey. I love the texture and the feel and the color. Sadly this wig was slightly shorter. It does not cup my chin which I was hoping for. Instead it brazes my cheeks which is ok. The plastic model is short in the face long in the neck so keep this in mind. While I do not want to shat all over this seller as I would buy from again about 75%. I suggest seeking ebay sellers from china, you can get better deals and more variety. + Amazon these days is kinda being a Nazi. Up to you. PS: each wig I bought from ebay had a breathable cap the hair was glued/sewed to (as in no rave lol), this one was an off beige color I didn&#x27;t feel matched, again up to you. But I did get an extra hair cap worth about 2$ for free. Facts.</li>
    <li> this wig was to small and didn&#x27;t even fit a child very easy. when we did find someone who could wear it, it would slip often even with the straps in place.</li>
    <li> There was no trouble at all with it its not too long and not too short it&#x27;s the perfect length.</li>
    <li> Nice Wig!, Shorter than expected but overall nice.</li>
    <li> The one good thing about this wig is the color. It&#x27;s a beautiful shade of purple and matches the photo. However, it&#x27;s quite a bit shorter than the photo makes it look. Also, it doesn&#x27;t really have layers like shown in the photo. It&#x27;s more like an asymmetrical bob. It&#x27;s kinda cute if you want a really short wig, but I didn&#x27;t, so I wasn&#x27;t happy with it. The photo is quite misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, I got great customer service from the seller when I contacted them about how unhappy I was.</li>
    <li> Nice wig, but I&#x27;m sad it&#x27;s not like the one shown in the picture. The one I received is a similar cut but a bob, about 3-5 inches shorter than the photo. It&#x27;s a chin length bob, and kinda like a helmet cut :/ the seller I chose was &amp;#34;Beautiful Scenery&amp;#34;. AND it is shedding, a lot. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure with the low price and everything what quality this wig would be, but it exceeded my expectations! It&#x27;s very high quality and shipped within a very reasonable amount of time. I would definitely recommend this product for everyone, and for any occasion. I personally used it to dress up as the character Olivia Vertigo from the book series Charlie Bone. I will positively use this for future events.</li>
    <li> This was the ugliest, most poorly made wig I&#x27;ve seen. It looked like I had a dead purple squirrel on top of my head. It was not at all as pictured, and it was immediately returned. Stay away from this one!</li>
    <li> The color is on point, and the wig is cute but MUCH shorter than expected. hits right below the ears, rather thn above shoulder as seen. Cute for the price though</li>
    <li> I have a lot of wigs and did not expect this one to be as nice as it is.  So soft and wonderful material!  Was a little shorter than I expected but just want I wanted</li>
    <li> I love this wig a lot!!! This wig is super cute and does not shed. I love how the wig compliments my skin tone as well. The only complaint I have about this wig is (of course) the fact that it is shorter than the picture advertises. My advice, get the wig, but don&#x27;t expect it to look like the picture. P. S.!!!! Here is the color of the wig in different lighting!!!</li>
    <li> This wig is still not here. It is a week overdue. Nothing has been done. I have been told to be patient. I am being patient. My patience wears thin.</li>
    <li> The wig I received was nothing like the picture, or the beautiful customer photos.  The length was longer than pictured, and the quality was very poor; the cap was visible beneath the hair no matter how it was styled, and there was excess glue all throughout the hair itself.  Despite several attempts at brushing and styling to overcome the poor quality, the wig is not wearable.</li>
    <li> It doesnt even cover my head! The hair in the back isnt even long enough to cover the end of my hairline on the nape of my neck. Hair is terribly thin as well. Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> I will say that it looks nothing like the picture (in my opinion) especially the style of the cut and the bangs. I was a little disappointed but it was only around $7 so its not too bad. Maybe I also do not know to put it on properly. The color is a little lighter but a computer screen will do that, still the color is nice.</li>
    <li> Hair was shorter than it appears in the picture, does not look the same on you as it does in the picture</li>
    <li> I love it. Perfect for what I needed for. Affordable and cute to boot.</li>
    <li> I like the wig and it was purchased for fun girls&#x27; weekend purpose. For what it was purchased for, it worked. Based on the picture, I expected it to be a little longer. Once I put it on my head, the length was shorter than described and the bangs, as pictured, are shorter than shown on the mannequin image.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the Kids on Halloween. They liked it and got a laugh</li>
    <li> When I first got the wig, It was whole different wig! I got a black and red curly wig instead.</li>
    <li> Really great! It arrived on time and fits like a glove!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig, but here&#x27;s the problem:&lt;br /&gt;Just like everyone else stated, the wig is smaller than you think it is, the mannequin head used in the product image, is very small, the actual hair itself is barely shoulder-length, but if this isnt a problem, then go ahead and buy it.  It arrived earlier than expected, and it cost under 10 dollars.  I would probably buy another as a backup.  :)</li>
    <li> Wig fits well and will probably fit even better when I figure out how to wear it properly. I was very surprised with the quality. Very nice. I suggest buying a stand for it.  I got one for $2.50. Had to wait for it to ship from china, but it was worth the price.</li>
    <li> did not look anything like the picture.. the color is on poin, but you have to style it and maybe cut a but to make it look decent. its alot shorter too</li>
    <li> The wig you receive is NOTHING like the picture. The hair barely goes past my ears. It is more like a bob cut.</li>
    <li> The person I bought it for loved it. I thought it looked a little fake but she really loved it and flipped her head around showing it off.</li>
    <li> Not as long as in the picture great wig.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured.  No layers.  Length is similar to a very short pixie cut. Only thing the same is the color. Very disappointed.  Glad I only wasted ten bucks.</li>
    <li> This wig is very inexpensive. In general, the styling is perfect, but the hair strands are attached to a white matrix, rather than a flesh colored one. I found this problematic in that it seemed like there was always some white showing no matter how we arranged the hair. Nonetheless it is a good quality item and if you want to jump to the next level - a wig with lots of hairs where the matrix doesn&#x27;t show through here and there, be prepared to pay significantly more.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s heat resistant. Yes, it&#x27;s a little too shiny to look real. But it&#x27;s pretty much exactly what&#x27;s shown in the picture and you get what you pay for. Another reviewer got one with black streaks in it, which sucks, but that didn&#x27;t happen to me. It was all purple (mine shipped from Prettyland). My only issue with it was I thought my face would look as good as the mannequin and I actually looked a little scary from the front unless I had it styled absolutely perfectly. I have pale skin and it made me look kinda crazy. It looks amazing from the back though.</li>
    <li> Its prefect for when I want to change up my look with something totally out of left field.Perfect for someone who likes to try new things or just for cosplay</li>
    <li> Bought this for my cat Darby&#x27;s first feline show and what a crowd pleaser. Darby and I decided he was going to go as Hit-Girl, seeing as Kick-Ass is his absolute favourite film (seriously, we have it on constant repeat). The hair went purr-fectly with his purple leather jacket and tartan skirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darby and I are very happy customers and recommend this for anyone looking to enter their cat in a Feline Performance Show.</li>
    <li> Not the it was my first cosplay wig I have ever gotten and the wigs inside is a skin color that clearly shows through. The with hair is really soft but really really short. Overall the wig was okay</li>
    <li> it fit funny and it didn&#x27;t look like the picture</li>
    <li> Very sexy wig I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Item not as pictured. The wig is extremely small not at all for an adult head and cut differently. In short you really get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Cut and re-styled to make a perfect Raven (Teen Titans) wig. Thicker and way better quality than expected for the price of the wig.</li>
    <li> The wig I received seems significantly shorter/less full than the one pictured. I think part of it is because mine arrived with the tips super flipped out, like to a crazy degree. I&#x27;m not too worried about that because I think I can flatten it. But also, the longer part doesn&#x27;t start until behind the ears, and basically it ends up looking a bit mullet-like. I still like it because it is pretty good quality, soft, and cute, just not exactly what I wanted--great for little pigtails though :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this Wig!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Super cute ... super fun!!</li>
    <li> this would look great on a skinny girl,  I am too fat to make this really look good on me</li>
    <li> In the picture the wig looks great, on the flips are not going in the same direction as the picture in real life, they are flipping out at the bottom and not in.  Also the bangs do completely cover one eye.  Otherwise the quality is great the hair feels real</li>
    <li> This wig is nothing like the picture.  It is much shorter than pictured, it isn&#x27;t layered like the picture either.  It is way more blunt and heavy and curls inward more than flipping outward.  After spending over an hour and with the help of many bobby pins and some scissors, I had something acceptable to wear, but not the look I was wanting.  Be aware, it isn&#x27;t the same wig.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best wig you&#x27;ll get for 8 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Soft, manageable synthetic hair with a slight flip out. The bangs come long, so be prepared for some minimal amount of styling-- that could mean just bobby-pinning them to the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very full, but combined with a large headband or hat? Looks just fine. Try layering or sewing together two of these if you really need volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye-catching color, great price.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t make it look ANYTHING like the pictures show</li>
    <li> It was quite unusual and will work great for displaying purposes of which is why I ordered it. Would order again from this company.</li>
    <li> It must be a child&#x27;s size and I just didn&#x27;t notice, because it&#x27;s a lot smaller than the picture would lead you to believe (and it&#x27;s not like I have an enormous head, either). It&#x27;s shorter than I expected, but the quality was okay (considering the price).</li>
    <li> love this wig!! soft real hair like, easy to style!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 year old granddaughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Its rather thin and the hair started falling out once i removed it in the bag. But it  fits great and it doesnt get tangled or matty looking. I woud buy again :)</li>
    <li> The cut is a bit longer in the front than what is pictured and it took a lot of playing around to find a style that worked good for me. It could also use some more hair in general as its hard to style without showing off a bald spot, otherwise nice.</li>
    <li> Nice, tho turns out I don&#x27;t liek the short style</li>
    <li> I wanted this wig so badly for a cosplay, but when it came it was the worst quality thing I have ever received. The wig netting was showing through the hair and it sticks out like a sore thumb against the dark purple hair.</li>
    <li> Do not but It has been a week since my item should have arrived and it hasn&#x27;t  I want my money back and amazon should shut this site down!</li>
    <li> This wig is totally awesome, I must say. Soft, silky and almost real-like were it not for the bright purple color! It arrived perfectly packaged and it&#x27;s quality is unbelievably high considering the price. It&#x27;s not quite as dark as pictured, however, and so for my purposes I sprayed a little black hairspray underneath.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot shorter than I expected it to be, but doesn&#x27;t necessarily look that bad! It&#x27;s super soft and feels like real hair, and I just have to slip it on and it&#x27;s on there forever until I take it off. The color is also a lot darker than I thought, but under any type of lighting (as in the picture) it becomes a really pretty purple. The color doesn&#x27;t matter much for me as I&#x27;m planning on dying it soon anyway. I would&#x27;ve given it the full five stars if only the length wasn&#x27;t so short, but hey, this is the best 6$ I&#x27;ve spent on anything. Plus, no matter what type of wig you get, it&#x27;s like a lottery: some will be amazing while others... Not so much. Overall, I&#x27;m actually really happy about this!! Best 6$!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this wig. It is on the smaller side and so it looks a little shorter on me than in the picture. It&#x27;s not falling apart and the base of the wig is nice and snug with an adjustable elastic strap. It also includes a cap to wear underneath. The color is slightly brighter than the pictures as well. It&#x27;s fairly comfortable and stays in place. I would recommend this product and may return to purchase more. I would recommend this product to others. I gave this wig 4 out of 5 stars because it is on the small side. I payed $8.69 and free S&amp;H when I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> The color is very bright but that&#x27;s the color I was hoping for.  It&#x27;s a little different from the picture, but very good for the character I wanted to cosplay.  It&#x27;s shorter than what the picture shows.</li>
    <li> color looked like a neon purple and it was waaaay shorter than the one in the image</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a woman undergoing chemo. She LOVED it.....and said it makes her smile every time she puts it on. Even her kids think it&#x27;s funny.  Anything to cheer up a friend.</li>
    <li> This wig is a HUGE disappointment. It&#x27;s a cheap wig, but it had pretty decent reviews. It looks absolutely NOTHING like the photo. It took me several minutes to figure out how to put it on because of the way the hair lays. It is also nearly bald in the back. It looks like a really bad, purple mullet. It is going back today. Don&#x27;t buy this unless it&#x27;s offered through Amazon Prime with free return shipping. You might get one that works and is super cute. Or you might end up spending $8 on a purple mullet. Seriously. It&#x27;s just bad. Really bad.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness! This wig looks exactly like the picture. I&#x27;m a very avid wearer of wigs in general but I&#x27;ve never tried a colored wig(just black or brown). It has body, lots of movement and get this ladies, it does not shed. I didn&#x27;t want to take it off the first time I wore it around the house. You&#x27;re given this instant sexy, sassy, flirty, or even innocent look depending on how you wear it. Thanks and I will definately order from them again!</li>
    <li> Horrible. Way shorter than what the pic shows. Very thin too..you can see the netting. You get what u pay for i guess.</li>
    <li> my daughter look adorable in this wig.  perfect cut and she loves the color.  The wig is that fake shiny stuff, but if you use dry shampoo (I know I always say that in my wig review.... but it works and makes the wigs look so much more real).  You can&#x27;t really style it, but it looks great the way it comes.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Definitely let it hang for a few days before wearing it.</li>
    <li> Even though I felt like the wig was a little bit long in the back I LOVE it. The color is just like in the pictures. It&#x27;s lightweight, feels like it could be real hair and didn&#x27;t get messed up when I flat ironed it.</li>
    <li> So, I love the wig in the picture the only problem is they didn&#x27;t send me that one, the cut they sent had longer bangs and a shorter back. For the price I don&#x27;t return items unless I hate them or really really want want I ordered. The wig I received is doable, the color is a deep gorgeous purple and the shorter cut makes me look younger so of course I kept it. I would have preferred the one in the picture but the one I got is pretty darn cute and my husband actually likes it better than the one in the pic. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Shows too much netting and will have to be styled to look close to pictured. But didn&#x27;t expect much for the price.</li>
    <li> Item is quite a bit shorter than in picture, it is a small bob and comes to my cheeks and not below the chin. It is lighter than in the picture and sheads quite a bit when brushed gently. This is good for a quick cosplay wig, but not for a long term cosplay wig unless you are extremely careful with it. The cap also runs a bit small .</li>
    <li> Did I get a different wig from all the reviewers? This wig isn&#x27;t one I&#x27;d take for free. It arrived a mess, does not remotely fit on my head - in this bizarre simultaneously too big and too small way - and has none of the style that the model (or any of the customer pictures) shows. Very disappointed and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> A lot shorter than in the picture. Small but other than that it&#x27;s a good wig.</li>
    <li> Decent quality, made well, nice color, kind of small barely fits, and much shorter than the picture ...luckily I have small head I can wear childs wigs or this wouldn&#x27;t have fit its almost smaller than some childrens wigs also not styled any thing like the pic</li>
    <li> Great soft wig, just a bit shorter than expected. Super quick delivery!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the thin side, which makes me nervous about wearing it out (can people see through it to the cap?). Haven&#x27;t tried styling it yet, but out of the box it looked good. The color is very pretty. I just wish it were a teensy bit thicker to give it less of a &amp;#34;this ain&#x27;t my real hair&amp;#34; feel.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig because I had some money left on a prepaid card I needed to use and I&#x27;ve always wanted a purple wig. So I thought &#x27;Why not?&#x27; I&#x27;m a cosplayer so I would easily find a use for it, but I am glad that I didn&#x27;t need it for someone specific. The color is slightly brighter and it is shorter than the picture. It&#x27;s slightly small and it could be a little thicker. It definitely doesn&#x27;t look like real hair. With all this being said it&#x27;s still a good wig for the price but the one thing that bothers me the most is that it is NOT heat resistant. Thankfully I tested a section of the wig before I tried to style it because it melts instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are simply looking for a short purple wig it is decent if you don&#x27;t have a large head or a lot of hair. It&#x27;s definitely better than a Party City wig and cheaper than them too. Just expect to not get the picture exactly and DO NOT try to style it. It is not heat resistant.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several wigs and this one is probably my favorite. it has a great vibrant color and is easy to wear. Getting the bangs right does take a little finesse, but it is worth it. I wore this to a company launch and almost everyone thought that it was my real hair just dyed. Hopefully I won&#x27;t need another, but if I do I definitely will reorder.</li>
    <li> I loved the style and color,fit perfect..but unfortunately after wearing it for only a month it stretched out and was impossible to hide the inside cap</li>
    <li> Your expectations have to be set for the price you are playing.  This is very good value for the price but don&#x27;t expect high quality hair.  It&#x27;s synthetic hair.  It is what it is.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend&#x27;s bachelorette party.  I wanted something that didn&#x27;t have that gross, cheap Halloween costume wig feel, but also not something super-expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig fit the bill perfectly.  Friends said if they didn&#x27;t know me they would have thought it was my real (dyed, of course) hair.  I had to walk several blocks in pretty heavy rain that night, and it fluffed right back up with a little blast from my friend&#x27;s hairdryer and I was ready to hit the club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to be aware of is that it is somewhat shorter than the picture portrays - more like a chin-length bob.  I still loved it!</li>
    <li> This would work if I was using it for a Halloween costume or something of that nature, maybe a rave wig, but definitely not cosplay. The color was way too neon, not like the picture :(</li>
    <li> It came in 3 weeks early. I love it!! It looks so real I am one happy client</li>
    <li> This is an amazing, comfortable, non-itchy wig that I wear out in public post-chemo. It looks like real hair that has been dyed.</li>
    <li> Well first i didnt get it.......and i want my money back..seriously i want my money back it wasnt worth it</li>
    <li> This wig is super cute.  I expected it to be a bit longer, but the pictures are accurate.  I haven&#x27;t had any problem with shedding or hairs bending and getting scruffy.  The only negatives I can think of are (1) that the bangs are the perfect length to keep rubbing around my eyes, and (2) I hoped it would have a bit of a natural part like in the picture.  If you push the hair back, it stays, but move too much (even just sitting around), and it will fall into your face again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I really do love this wig, it&#x27;s so fun to wear around.  It makes me want to do this to my real hair!</li>
    <li> The color of the wig was darker than shown here with black streaks in it. It does not come styled as shown in the picture.  It does have the spikes in the back in I am sure if styled it would look just as good. Its a little itchy. Its also shorter than I thought it would be</li>
    <li> oh my, where to start. This week is shorter than it looks, didn&#x27;t come anywhere near the middle of my neck, its very very thin and doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of body, you can see the wig cap through the hair which completely defeats the purpose.i guess you get what you pay for, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
    <li> Words do not express how much I love this wig. I would give it 5 stars, but what I got was different than what I first expected. I ended up loving it anyway though. It was my first wig and I bought it maybe two years ago. It&#x27;s shorter that the model, and more &amp;#34;rounded&amp;#34; to your head than straight. Depending on the lighting and your skin tone the purple can look like different shades. I&#x27;ll post pics from when I first got it, and one from when I let a close friend borrow it. I love that it&#x27;s so versatile though, you can make a bunch of different styles with it, and it&#x27;s very full. It stays secure to your head too.</li>
    <li> Mine is no where near as long as the one pictured. It&#x27;s cute but VERY short. Not what I expected. See pic attached.</li>
    <li> I opted to wear a hat over this wig when I got it because otherwise the scalp material would show as there wasn&#x27;t enough hair to cover the liner. Love the color, and the style. This could be great with a few minor changes in production. Good news is it was inexpensive so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Just like the picture. Nice!</li>
    <li> I love this wig! Soft, natural looking, does not tangle. Color is vibrant. It is adjustable. Totally in love. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best wig I&#x27;ve seen! For such a low price you are getting a steal! Every time I wear it I get compliments, everyone thinks it is my real hair. Holds up to it&#x27;s description, and yes it is heat resistant! I&#x27;ve used my straightener on it many times and it does not do any damage. Definitely recommend this product, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This wig is even better than in the picture I was very impressed with it, and received a lot of compliments on it. The cut is very stylish, and looks professional. I wore it for NYE, and have been trying very hard to wear it for another reason. I may have to make something up.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to use for the various plays I put on and besides a great price they feel and look totally real!  I bought a bunch of other ones in different colors and styles from this seller.  Super fast shipping and great wigs, I am totally satisfied with every one!</li>
    <li> Shorter than expected, but still nice and full and bright color.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying wigs online, especially because I had never bought any, but this wig is wonderful!  Looks like my actual hair and isn&#x27;t itchy at all.  Also has adjustable straps on the inside for best fit! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig! It is well made, light and fun.  The color is pretty much true to picture.  The hair does not fall out or stretch out.  It is easy to &amp;#34;sass&amp;#34; up for a wild look or tame down for an unkempt look.  It is a fun alternative to the normal everyday color and style! I will buy from this company again.  I may even possibly buy this same wig in different colors because I love it so much!!!</li>
    <li> I give It 5 outta 5, the color Is as shown, I&#x27;ve wore It not stop for like a month and had no shedding. It&#x27;s easy to manage, lightweight and all around fun to wear I got so many compliments on It and everyone thought I really died my hair, lol,If something were to happen to this wig I would definitely order another.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, fits perfectly, quality is amazing and color is to die for. I love everything about this wig. The bangs are long but I&#x27;m going to just  pin them to the side for the costume anyhow.</li>
    <li> Exactly as you see it, super cute and awesome value. Great experience buying from this seller, will use them again.</li>
    <li> I have hair down to my butt so I wanted to try something completely different and I definitely hit the jackpot! the purple is a little more bright than it appears on the picture but either way it&#x27;s a great wig...one friend even thought I had cut and dyed my hair lol</li>
    <li> I ordered this cute short purple wig and was happy to see the box on my bed when I got home. I opened it up and was disappointed to see it was a long black curly wig with red streaks. I don&#x27;t make a lot of fuss so I&#x27;ll just order another one when I can.</li>
    <li> The color is not as dark as pictured. It looks like different shades of blue and purple in different lighting. It is a little this as far as hair and so some places you can see the lace lining if there is not enough hair covering it. I did put baby powder on it a little because it was on the shiny side. Now it looks like my real hair. Overall for my very first wig ever I love it! its light weight and I will be using it at my Avengers 5k run tomorrow at Disneyland! Hopefully it stays on, so far with the aid cap they gave and another nylon cap on top of that the wig is snug and is not budging. Hopefully it stays while I run. I will be running as She Hulk. So if you happen to be running this event say hi :)</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments on the wig! Thanks for a great product and speedy delivery. :3</li>
    <li> The wig looks absolutely cute, pretty close to the picture. I had to rate it lower for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt; 1.) the wig cap is too small and it&#x27;s hard to cover up your whole head. I have a regular-sized head for a girl. With longer wigs it&#x27;s not as much of a problem because the long hair covers up your hair that shows underneath but with short wigs having too small of a wig cap is much more noticeable. So that&#x27;s one star gone.&lt;br /&gt; 2.) there are some areas that are not sewn well and it is unraveling on certain hair tracks and the hair is coming off in small chunks. I will have to finish off the seams myself if I hope to keep this wig wearable. 3 stars because the wig is cheaply priced and looks cute despite the flaws. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this wig. It is a lot shorter (goes to the ears) and it looks different too - bowl cut. Just saying, but if that is what you are looking for it is great - I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, the color its perfect and it fits as expected. recomended.</li>
    <li> Although this wig is really cute &amp; a great color, it does not look the same way as it does in the picture. Maybe it&#x27;s that my face is just way different from the mannequin&#x27;s, I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s more like a bob-type cut coming just below the earlobes, with only about an inch longer layer that &amp;#34;flips out&amp;#34; on the back of the neck. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get it to style like it looks in the picture, which was the reason I got it in the first place. I even tried using my curling iron, straightening iron, etc, and it just wouldn&#x27;t stay. So for that, I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;But overall, for the price, it was still a great deal. It&#x27;s cute and it fits well, comes with a wig cap, looks cute on, and got me lots of compliments. I would still recommend it, only with the statement that it may not look exactly as it does in the picture.</li>
    <li> The wig is much shorter than it looks online and much lighter...not Yoruichi enough...</li>
    <li> The wig looks adorable on my teenage daughter and loco adult friends.</li>
    <li> Finally!!!, got the wig, the pictures clearly say that the hair cap is included but it was not. Too late to place any orders now as this was for halloween. So i got one part of a two piece order.</li>
    <li> $9.99 including shipping and handling, so I&#x27;ve had a difficult time with it.  I can fix it after hours of trying,but, believe me when you put it on, it just doesn&#x27;t look like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s worth it for costumes, kids to play in and I&#x27;ll even wear it after a session that I have time for.</li>
    <li> This wig is a mess! It is VERY short, does not even reach my mid cheek in the front and mullet in back. The hair is very thin and has a beige cap under the dark purple hair so you can see it. I read some good reviews so I was hopeful but back in the box to Amazon it goes. Worse than the one we saw at Party City! Just BAD!</li>
    <li> Looks realistic and really pretty! I love the texture and the feel of it. Makes for a good costume hair</li>
    <li> The wig came early.  It was very soft.  It was medium thickness, lots of movement and very wavy. overall good wig except some of the wefts were coming loose which I fixed myself.  You get very minimal shedding when you get the wig and then it stops after a swipe of the brush.  I would definitely recommend this wig to everyone</li>
    <li> love it, would recommended to family and friends.</li>
    <li> The wig came a bit shorter and lighter than expected. However I still love it so it worked out for me!</li>
    <li> Love it came quick order order more</li>
    <li> Wig was perfect looked like the picture.</li>
    <li> My favorite wig, feels super soft and is easy to style.</li>
    <li> Bad...wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> The front of this wig is great, but the back is so thin that it&#x27;s unusable. The one I received has less than one-third of the thickness shown in the photo of the back. It also arrived with the stitching coming out in one row of hair, so that section is hanging loose. I was extremely disappointed, since the hair itself is soft and the color is true to the photos. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t wear it like it is, so it was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Wig looks nothing like the picture. Although it&#x27;s good material and looks real, the cut and color are nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> Kind of small but still like the color,cut and length.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great price.  However mine doesnt look like the picture. Guess I will have to play around with it to get it to look like that.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this wig for a cosplay and was happy that it came in on time. Upon opening it, I tried it on and it looked NOTHING like the picture. One side of the wig had little hair and the style was just completely different. Not only this, but upon trying it on, the wig was too small...and I have medium length hair and have had no problems with other wigs. I am not even going to wear this wig for the cosplay!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The only things I liked about this wig are: it&#x27;s the color purple that I needed AND it arrived in time.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s a little glossy looking which is to be expected in this price range, but its much nicer than say a halloween or costume wig. I wear mine for normal daily activities, for  the price it is actually nicer than I thought it would be. I have worn it several times &amp; used my wig brush on it &amp; it doesn&#x27;t seem to shed much at all &amp; the style &amp; color is exactly as pictured :)</li>
    <li> This wig gives a trendy, punky look to my new mannequin, which came with a much, much more conservative wig.  She still looks very classy but with a little look of a wild side.</li>
    <li> great movement, full coverage. Really love this wig</li>
    <li> The wig looks like pictured and can be manipulated by a light setting on a flat iron or curling device.</li>
    <li> The wig I just like the picture, and fits nicely. They even included a wig cap, which was a nice surprise!</li>
    <li> Nice but not as long as the pic shows</li>
    <li> Thin beige wig cap and SUPER SUPER small cap. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is a great wig. Very soft, and true to the color shown. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it \\&quot;sheds\\&quot; a lot. Several of the hairs fell out all through the night when I was wearing it. Other than that, I loved it!</li>
    <li> had trouble ftting in on my head over my hair</li>
    <li> I love this hair... I wore it to Mardi Gra and I am extremely happy with the look of it.</li>
    <li> it is exactly as shown.  great cut. great feel. light. great color. absolutely beautiful! very happy with my purchase thank you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute little wig, but it&#x27;s way too shiny for me.</li>
    <li> The wig was way to short and fit on an adult head. Everyone who tried to wear it just couldn&#x27;t. The wig wasn&#x27;t even adjusted. The wig was also way to thin to the point that if you slightly move some strands of hair, you can clearly see the wig cap the hair is attached to.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this wig. The color was right. But the sizing is way off, if you have a veryyyy small head then this may fit like the picture. The hair is MUCH shorter than it appears in the pictures, and the style/cut is different than the picture too. Pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> WAYYY SHORTER THAN ADVERTISED</li>
    <li> shorter than described and appears in picture. the back does not cover my hair line</li>
    <li> Wig is way shorter in person than in the picture! It barely even covers my ears..more like a very short bob cut which isnt what I wanted. That is the reason for my low rating. The wig itself is good quality.</li>
    <li> Really good wig. I had my doubts but it&#x27;s pretty good! Make sure you brush with a comb and not a brush.</li>
    <li> Color seems to be a shade lighter, maybe even brighter color then shown.  This may be due to the settings on my computer.  Great cheap wig.</li>
    <li> this wig is nice, not much shedding.. I received many compliments. it is exactly as pictured so you have to hairspray or cut it  if you want the hair out of your face.. the only downfall is the cap is white so it shows in several places.</li>
    <li> Cute, fits well, nice that it came with a hair net. I like it!</li>
    <li> bought this for a friend undergoing chemotherapy. She was very happy with it and the price was great.</li>
    <li> Wig is very short and took long to receive.  I would not recommend unless you have a small head and want really short hair.</li>
    <li> very messy cheap I can&#x27;t get that style in the picture at all will not recommend this item color is clown purple awful</li>
    <li> its kinda small and the hair is thin on some places so you can see the netting on the wig sometimes, but its really pretty and fun to wear.</li>
    <li> Surprised it came a few weeks earlier. It doesn&#x27;t exactly look like picture, but will have to do . It&#x27;s for a Bridal Shower, all are wearing colored wigs, this style is nice, but the cut/shape of it, isn&#x27;t like the picture, so a little disappointed. Will have to do for 1 night.</li>
    <li> Its a truely amazing wig, My cosplayer sister love it.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality, thin, and a much brighter/more costume-y color of purple than the picture. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> *thumbs down* too small</li>
    <li> based on the picture i expected the hair/style to be longer, its fine and will suit my purpose but the picture was off...</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this zero stars! The wig arrived and looks NOTHING like the image advertised! It&#x27;s WAY shorter. It&#x27;s also very poorly made. Totally annoyed and disappointment. Do NOT buy this item! Will not do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> Will go well with my other fun wigs</li>
</ol>
