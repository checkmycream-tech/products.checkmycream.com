      <li>I immediatelt fell in love with this.</li>
      <li>This is the best performing flat iron on the market.  </li>

      <li>I loved it at first</li>

      <li>/&gt;Overall I am thrilled and I hope it lasts me a good long while!!</li>
      <li>Glides smoothly after some use.</li>
      <li>I think the Hai is just fantastic, it is comfortable to hold, and the temperature ranges are convenient.</li>
      <li>, but I was okay with that because I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>I use the iron to smooth, flatten and even out the ends of my bob.  </li>
      <li>The ability to select your temperature setting is a great feature and it heats instantly to desired temperature.</li>
      <li>She was right my hair is healthy and shiny again.</li>

      <li>If your looking for a great flat iron than look no further, this is the best flat iron ever!!!</li>
      <li>Great, that is, for six months, when it abruptly stopped working.  </li>
      <li>I honestly loved this flat iron until it decided yesterday (for no reason at all) to quit working.</li>
      <li>I loved this flat iron.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
      <li>On my processed hair, I use the 280 F or 320 F settings and get tremendous results.</li>
      <li>I like the manual dial of the HAI Classic better.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
      <li>The first one was stolen!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light, gets hot very fast.</li>
      <li>but no auto shut off and doesn&#x27;t work quite as well particularly the Her Style, although the Hai blue is a good bang for the buck.  </li>
      <li>It heats up super fast and does a great job, much better than my previous discount store flat irons.</li>
      <li>Th shippment was fast and quick and got it before Christmas.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve had the regular Hai iron with the blue plates and the Her Style, works great</li>
      <li>have hair that is very straight already, but I have chopped it into a blunt bob which tends to poof up and the bottoms curl every direction.  </li>
      <li>When she got it first thing</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this seller and product!!</li>
      <li>otherwise i absolutely recommend this iron!</li>
      <li>I got this about a week ago, and tried it today for the first time...</li>
      <li>Snags some hairs as first.</li>
      <li>The first one I blew up in India using even using a converter/adapter thingy.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know what the problem is exactly (the plates???)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has different heat settings and I love that it will turn off automatically after a period of time, and even alarms you that it is turning off</li>
      <li>First one I purchased stopped working after 8 months.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron, it heats up fast and quick and is ready to use.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>

      <li>Without using the highest setting, the iron made my hair straight and silky in about five minutes.</li>
      <li>The thing heated up straight away, and I got to select the temp for my hair.</li>
      <li>Much to my demise</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have had this iron for a little over one month now, which is not enough time to really comment on durability/lifetime/etc... but I will say that this iron is incredibly gentle, user-friendly, safe and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair that is very straight already, but I have chopped it into a blunt bob which tends to poof up and the bottoms curl every direction.  I use the iron to smooth, flatten and even out the ends of my bob.  It is small enough (width-wise and profile-wise) to grab even the shortest section at the back of my neck and tame it, which I was unable to do with my previous iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has both an automatic shut-off, and if you press and hold the \\&quot;up\\&quot; button you can also turn it off.  It has six heat settings, of which I choose the lower values (around 260 degrees) since I am terrified of frying my hair and do not need the straightening power that some curls likely need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am thrilled and I hope it lasts me a good long while!!</li>
    <li> i love this flat iron!! its fabulous and does wonders for my hair! i have long, thick, curly hair and it leaves my hair smooth, soft, and frizz free. also, my hair still retains the perfect amount of volume. i would give this straightener five stars but it isn&#x27;t great for super thick hair because it takes a long time. if you have extremely thick hair then i recommend investing in a hot iron with larger plates. otherwise i absolutely recommend this iron! i LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron abruptly quit working within 6 months of purchase.  My daughter held on to the original box and warranty, but misplaced the invoice and of course without that they won&#x27;t honor the warranty.  My point is even if we had the original invoice who wants to go without their flat iron while you ship it back for repairs.</li>
    <li> I bought a Chi three years ago and it died on me a few months ago. I was really irritated since I spent 150.00. I thought it would last longer than my old cheapie 20.00 flat iron-not so. Anyway, my sister let me borrow her HAI Elite to see how I liked it. I love it!! Way better than the Chi. I can flat iron much faster with the Hai and it shuts off automatically if I forget to turn it off. Great feature and it&#x27;s cheaper than the Chi I bought. I purchased one the very next day and free shipping.</li>
    <li> The HAI has mulitple temperature options and works great. Anytime you apply a heated product to the hair there is going to be some damage, the HAI has found a way to minimize this and still offer a great styling product. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a CHI user for nearly ten years. Swore by it&#x27;s ability to straighten my thick hair. However, on a recent trip to a friend&#x27;s house in Florida I discovered the HAI straightener. The humidity made my hair poofy and frizzy, so I borrowed the iron. I immediatelt fell in love with this. The thing heated up straight away, and I got to select the temp for my hair. Without using the highest setting, the iron made my hair straight and silky in about five minutes. I Easy to use, with great results. I came home and bought one for myself. Of course, I still have my trusty ol CHI ... but it&#x27;s in a drawer whereas the HAI is the one getting regular use.</li>
    <li> Rough on hair.  Didn&#x27;t straighten easily.</li>
    <li> This is the best performing flat iron on the market.  The ability to select your temperature setting is a great feature and it heats instantly to desired temperature. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and no other compares in qualify or performance.  The product arrived on the date promised.</li>
    <li> I got this about a week ago, and tried it today for the first time...it makes an awful ripping noise when i am using it, even though i am being very careful.  don&#x27;t know what the problem is exactly (the plates???), but this is going back....also, it has no on/off switch, and is not exactly easy to turn on/off...had to play with it for a little while before i was sure it was indeed off...no warning \\&quot;beep\\&quot; when it gets to desired temp., but does blink; however, the fact that it&#x27;s potentially ripping my hair is enough reason for me to send it back!  Sorry....also, please note: the black (fake felt) interior in the case gets black stuff all over the product!!! horrible stuff!  wish manufactures would take note!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron but does not last long. First one I purchased stopped working after 8 months. Tried to purchase another one thinking the first was defective,  but this one only lasted 2 months.</li>
    <li> I honestly loved this flat iron until it decided yesterday (for no reason at all) to quit working. What a joke! You would think paying this much for a flat iron that it would work for AT LEAST a couple of years......NOPE!!! 3 stinkin&#x27; months!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist use this flat iron on my hair all the time and I just had to buy one for myself. I love this flat iron, it heats up fast and quick and is ready to use. If your looking for a great flat iron than look no further, this is the best flat iron ever!!! The product was more than I hoped for. I bought 2 of these, one for my daughter and me. Th shippment was fast and quick and got it before Christmas. Respond well to my e-mail and questions quick, Thank you!! I would highly recommend this seller and product!!</li>
    <li> Love Hai products. Currently have the same straightener and has lasted over 4 years, still works but getting a little worn out from so much use. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife about 2.5 years ago. Good solid choice while it lasted. It just stop working a month ago.</li>
    <li> Best iron ever! Hair looks beautiful, shiny and stays healthy!</li>
    <li> This straightener was great!  Great, that is, for six months, when it abruptly stopped working.  I have read other reviews where this happened, so I would consider it a normal occurrence.  Purchase this only if you are a risktaker and moneymaker.</li>
    <li> How do we know these reviews are written by real people and not the company themselves. I would love to believe the reviews but how can I. I am looking to purchase a good flat iron for thin color treated hair. But I don&#x27;t know what to think.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this HAI Nano XT Tourmaline Flat Iron.  It heats up super fast and does a great job, much better than my previous discount store flat irons. Also,the Amazon price was alot cheaper than my hairdresser&#x27;s supplier for the same product. Use it just about every day and works great!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift 3 years ago, and I only had to buy a new one because my dog knocked it off the counter into the toilet. -__-&lt;br /&gt;It has different heat settings and I love that it will turn off automatically after a period of time, and even alarms you that it is turning off so you can turn it back on if needed. It heats up within a minute. My friends who have had Chi&#x27;s have even loved my HAI.</li>
    <li> met my expectations, i only wish it was a soft case, better for traveling.  it&#x27;s light, gets hot very fast. i like it.</li>
    <li> I loved this flat iron. It worked better than all the others I have tried. Recently though, the one I purchased back in December 2014, failed on me in April 2015. So naturally, I ordered another one. BUT this is now August 2015 and again it failed and died. I ordered another one ONLY because I have amazon points but this will be the last time. I may switch over to the T3 Flat Iron line instead. I can&#x27;t rely on a product that just dies out after 5 months.</li>
    <li> Bought this iron b/c my hair stylist had one and strongly recommended it!  I was worried at spending so much on a flat iron.  Well, I shouldn&#x27;t have worried...it&#x27;s awesome!  Heats up quickly.  Is lightweight.  Works with just one pass through of hair.  Super product!!!  I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this flat iron. I have been straightening my hair for many years now, and have used the CHI (which are awful) flat irons as well as the Infra (sold as salons)which I upgraded from to the Hai Elite Nano XT iron. I think the Hai is just fantastic, it is comfortable to hold, and the temperature ranges are convenient. My hair is exactly how I like it without frizz and it stays that way throughout the entire day. My only complaint, and the reason for a 4 star review is that I can&#x27;t seem to turn it on by pressing the temp down button. It turns on at the highest temp and then I have to lower it to where I want it. It needs a memory feature. Overall it works beautifully!</li>
    <li> The HAI Elite Nano uses a digital temperature meter so you can&#x27;t dial in the exact temperature you want.  It also doesn&#x27;t remember what temperature you chose last time so you have to punch it in every time.  I like the manual dial of the HAI Classic better.  The plastic part of the iron is fatter so you can&#x27;t get it as close to your scalp as with the Hai Classic.  The plates seem to be similar to the Classic, just orange (ceramic-coated metal plates).</li>
    <li> Bought the flat iron as a gift for my wife. Her Chi which she loved broke so I tried to see if there was something better out there. Her hair stylist uses a Hai and recommended it to her. When she got it first thing she said the quality didn&#x27;t feel as good as her Chi. She also complained that the iron would pull her Hair. We returned the Iron and bought a Ghd which she likes and cost twice as much as the Hai and Chi.[[ASIN:B0017O37WG HAI Elite Nano XT Tourmaline Flat Iron, 1\\&quot;]]</li>
    <li> Love this iron it has many heat settings to choose from. My previous iron did not have heat settings it was just on or off and was damaging my hair.  A hair stylist explained it does not take a high heat to flat iron hair and I needed to get a temperature control iron. She was right my hair is healthy and shiny again.</li>
    <li> It pulls my hair, your hair catches on the end of it. Used Hai for years, this is not worth the money. I will try to return it.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I have thick, curly hair and this iron tames my frizzes and produces a straight hair in one go at it! I like the automatic turn off as at work I worry if I had forgotten to turn off my flat iron! The coated iron plates also help to smooth your hair and make it shiny and not dry! If you are thinking about getting a flat iron GET THIS ONE!!!</li>
    <li> Safe: Turns off automatically after no usage&lt;br /&gt;Reliable: Leaves hair shiny and soft&lt;br /&gt;Versatile: Has different range of temperature settings&lt;br /&gt;Comparable to the Chi though not necessarily better. Hair results may be the same but the Hai Elite Nano does have options my Chi didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I lost my last one and had to save up to replace it. Thank God I finally got it back. I love this iron and will never change. It is worth every penny! It came in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> This is the best in the market. I tried many brands. This is my second one. The first one was stolen!</li>
    <li> The ceramic is the best for your hair when it comes to flat ironing. The width is perfect for curling as well. Glides smoothly after some use. Snags some hairs as first. Only problem is the initial snagging and that I&#x27;ve never managed to have one of these bad boys for more than 2.5 years.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my old one, but just good enough to keep me from going through the hassle of returning it.</li>
    <li> A hairdresser friend of mine has it and I&#x27;ve tried it before and liked it. Then I purchased my own, and for some reason, this literally would NOT get through one section of hair without pulling hair out of my head! The ends of the plates are made slightly sticking out and that is where the hair was getting caught. It was so obnoxious that I had to send it back. I&#x27;m not sure If I got a defective one or not.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Hai Elite from my hairdressers recommendation. I loved it at first then it started making my hair greasy. Tried cleaning it but it didn&#x27;t help.  Then it just died. I am the only person who uses it and not every day...the fact that a \\&quot;hairdresser quality\\&quot; iron only lasted as long as the warranty does is sad to say the least. Company did give me a replacement at cheaper cost but the same exact thing happened (greasy hair/stopped working).  Not bothering to try again.  Got a great straighter for $40 -- if it dies in two years I won&#x27;t mind it will still have been 3x more cost effective than the elite.</li>
    <li> Awesome and amazing &amp; doesn&#x27;t fry your hair! Even my hair dresser noticed a difference in my hair quality. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after her other flat iron died.  After consulting some of her friends, I purchased this one and she loves it!!  She says it is much better than her other one and really likes the warrently.</li>
    <li> I started using the HAI about for or five years ago.  I actually purchased it through my salon at retail price (ouch!), but I was okay with that because I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  This may not be for every case, but for mine, I sent in the insurance form, which replaces a malfunctioned device with a BRAND NEW one!  You have to mail the straightener along with a check for return shipping to the company.  As soon as they get it, they mail you a brand new one.  I&#x27;ve replaced mine twice.  The first one I blew up in India using even using a converter/adapter thingy.  It is a well-crafted device that can straighten the toughest of curls.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have had the flat iron for almost two years and I have yet to find a flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron comes with 6 preset temperatures to choose from (210 F, 240 F, 280 F, 320 F, 360 F, and 390 F) which may be an issue for some but worked out well for me. To turn on the iron, you click on the &#x27;UP&#x27; button and the iron will automatically be on the 360 F setting but then you can adjust it to whatever you&#x27;d like. The iron takes almost no time to heat which is great for hectic mornings. Also, there are two rubber strip-thingies and some curves where your thumb and index fingers would rest when you hold the iron. This makes flat-ironing very comfortable and it gives you a lot of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I have very coarse hair but I chemically relax. Because I process my hair, heating tools are often a &#x27;no-no,&#x27; but I still opt to flat-iron, on average, twice a week. This iron GLIDES through my hair. I don&#x27;t even need put in any product to aid in straightening my hair (although I do use a light water-based moisturizer to be on the safe side). On my processed hair, I use the 280 F or 320 F settings and get tremendous results. When my natural texture starts growing out, I usually use the 360 F setting (in rare instances, the full 390 F).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is the real deal... no bogus ceramic coating that fades away over time. But my absolutely favorite feature is the safety turn-off. It provides great peace of mind for a worry-wart like me.</li>
    <li> My girl&#x27;s love this flat iron.  They&#x27;re in their 20&#x27;s and have cheaper irons.  They&#x27;ve used mine quite often.  Much to my demise I&#x27;m on my second iron.  The first finally quit after about 3 or 4 years.  They&#x27;ve burned my bathroom counters with their irons by forgetting to shut them off.  We&#x27;ve had the regular Hai iron with the blue plates and the Her Style, works great but no auto shut off and doesn&#x27;t work quite as well particularly the Her Style, although the Hai blue is a good bang for the buck.  I purchased a second Nano XT for the quality and shut off feature.  I also purchased 2 more of these as Christmas gifts for my daughters before they burn the house down.  I can get dressed, do my hair and run without the worry of \\&quot;did I shut my flat iron off\\&quot;?  No more running home to check.  :)</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a step up from what I had been using.  Its lightweight and does the job effortless</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Works great.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom I don&#x27;t know how good it is but I&#x27;m guessing it sucks I think I heard it over heated or something</li>
