      <li>Very great and cheap product</li>
      <li>Best make-up remover available.</li>
      <li>Was worried about authenticity after the reviews, but was all good.</li>
      <li>An oil-based cleanser or remover would work best here; however, this is still perfect for me, as I have eyelash extensions (perfect for lazy gals like me), and you cannot put oil-based beauty products close to the lash line.</li>
      <li>in all, I love this product considering the price and how good it does its job!  </li>

      <li>Really wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the waterproof kind yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A cult favorite for good reason.</li>
      <li>Perfection... easy to use, all good ingredients, what is not to love?!</li>
      <li>The Bioderma I received from France was amazing - it was able to remove my waterproof eye make-up, was non-sticky, and very refreshing to use, basically living up to its hype.  </li>

      <li>My skin is very easily agitated and this has not harmed or irritated my skin in any way.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the product, always re-order it but this time it came with a broken lid</li>
    <li> I bought this product awhile back because Garance Dore talked about it on her blog. Her dermatologist told her that her tap water was too harsh for her skin and to use crealine instead. I am always up for a new skincare product and decided to try it. I do love it for its cleansing ablilty and use it nightly. I think I may be going through it a bit fast as a water replacement....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product being recommended and talked about multiple times.  I used to use the makeup remover &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; from Benefit until it was discontinued.  For the past couple of years, I&#x27;ve been using Pond&#x27;s makeup removing wipes, which still work very well.  The Bioderma one is a great replacement for the Benefit one, and better.  For one thing, the price is much lower.  Bioderma is $36 for 500ml; Benefit was $28 for 200ml (if my memory serves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it, I usually use a big cotton pad and wipe my face with each side.  That&#x27;ll do the job.  What surprised me was it even removed mascara.  I haven&#x27;t tried the waterproof kind yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this product considering the price and how good it does its job!  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My 4th bottle. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my eyes, it is gentle and doesn&#x27;t burn. Can be used to take off all makeup in a pinch. This is the only eye makeup remover I use now...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting like some do…. lasts forever!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very gentle and fragrance free, just like washing your face with water. Gentle enough to use it for cleaning my face in the morning and night time. Packaging is safe for traveling. The slight down side to this, it is hard to buy in the US. I have not seen it in any of the beauty health product store.</li>
    <li> Takes off all make up including eye makeup and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel stripped. It doesn&#x27;t burn my skin. I will definitely continue to use and buy this product.</li>
    <li> Product delivered with no problem.</li>
    <li> i use this on my 10 year old son at night and it seems to work well. it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I love the way it removes my eye makeup completely with absolutely no oily residual and acts like a toner after I have washed my face. But I have one big complaint! The lid is so flimsy and cheap. I would love to throw this in my drawer in my bathroom, but the lid would more than likely fall off. The little plastic tab connected the lid to the bottle broke right away. For the amount of money that I am paying for this product I would expect a better design. I will still buy it, but come on...put your product in a sturdier container with a better lid!</li>
    <li> Takes off my eye makeup without any burning or stinging. I completely get the hype behind this product. A cult favorite for good reason. Fast shipping from this seller.</li>
    <li> Best make-up remover available. Hands down.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with how this removes waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;It does not do it well.</li>
    <li> well as other recieved bad quality of this product. I did not even recieve anything!</li>
    <li> I discovered this product years ago on a trip to Paris.  It is great for removing makeup.  Very pure and gentle</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel so clean. I use before I wash my face and after, on a flat cotton round.</li>
    <li> It was first time purchase. After Using it, I really liked it! For sure, I&#x27;m willing to purchase again. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I wish they sold this in the states, however, if they did it would probably be filled with loads of junky chemicals... It&#x27;s so gentle and completely dissolves all of my makeup and mascara. Love, Love, Love my Bioderma Crealine!</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive, dry skin and this cleanser is perfect for me.  It cleans very precisely and I don&#x27;t need to use a water anymore which makes my skin only dry and peel off.  I&#x27;ll buy this product again when my all is !!!!!!  I would highly recommended it to everybody who has this same skin as me do.  A+++++ product !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, very gentle. I use it when I&#x27;m being lazy. I used to use make-up removing cleansing cloths but this is waaayyyyyy better. My skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated and it gets dirt and make-up off well.</li>
    <li> Easy to take my make up off, keeps the skin clean and smooth.  Highly recommend it to all the ladies</li>
    <li> I like this makeup remover a lot. However I wear a lot of bright lipsticks and using this to remove them left a weird taste on my lips. Given that all the packaging is not written in English, I worried I was consuming chemicals I shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the originial Micellaire solution. It&#x27;s my favorite way to take off makeup and the day&#x27;s grime off my face. Delicate but gets the job done</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It does smell a little wonky but its very gentle. It makes your skin feel very refreshed, almost like something tingly touched your pores, but not in an irritating way. It felt like it was really working to get the grime out of my skin in a way that a rinse off cleanser ever could. I&#x27;ve also found that it soothes breakouts since there is nothing to dry out the skin. Removes makeup very well while still not irritating the skin or causing you to have to tug on your skin! I apply some cleansing solution to a cotton pad and apply it to my eyes. I hold it there for about 10 seconds and then gently wipe my eye makeup off. I then apply some to a pad sweep it across my face and neck.  I would recommend this Bioderma cleansing water to those with normal to dry skin, normal to combination skin, and sensitive skin. I think that people with skin that is on the oilier side would better appreciate Bioderma&#x27;s cleansing water for combination/oily skin. Those that are oily and breakout prone might want to consider that solution over the Sensibio/Crealine one, but those with any other type skin prone to breakouts should use the Crealine/Sensiobio cleansing water.</li>
    <li> The best makeup remover ever!</li>
    <li> Such a big bottle! Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love it! The best demaquilant ever</li>
    <li> Easy make-up remover. Fits my skin perfectly and I have a very dry skin. Very gentle and does not irritate.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It takes all make-up off, even mascara.  You just us a couple of large cotton pads, both sides, and wipe until no trace of make-up is showing on the pad.</li>
    <li> Really like it. I am sure I will order it again.</li>
    <li> It makes all other products look like junks. No exaggeration here. I really wish I had used it early on...</li>
    <li> I use this product to remove my foundation and eye makeup and it is excellent at both. It feels a bit tacky after it dries, so I rinse with a facecloth and moisturize afterwards. I have found it excellent for makeup removal and is also very gentle on my skin. The best miceller water I have used so far. Definite keeper.</li>
    <li> I had seen a lot about this product on Youtube so I purchased it and I really love it. It doesn&#x27;t make your face feel oily but yet it really gets your make up off. I will defiantly be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> I find the solution of this product to be too watery for a true face wash and don&#x27;t want to waste a bunch of cotton rounds to remove makeup. Instead, I use this after washing my face normally to ensure all my makeup and any grime is removed. I also use it for eye makeup remover. For these purposes, I give this product 5 stars. It is truly non-irritating and non-oily. Makes me feel very clean.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cleaning my face.  With some wipes you feel like you just haven&#x27;t absolutely removed everything.  With a squirt of this on a cotton pad, I feel like my face is completely cleaned. Put some cotton pads in a small plastic container, dampen them with Bioderma for use when I travel.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It does take off make up, even heavy mascara without difficulty.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to think you don&#x27;t have to wash it off, but that&#x27;s just what we have been programed to do.  Lovely stuff really.  But I do feel I need to have a good facial scrub once or twice a week.  But that too could be the industry telling me so, to sell me more stuff.  lol</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  Works well.  No stinging, burning, etc. Very refreshing feeling.  It&#x27;s great at correcting an eyeliner/mascara mistake too.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth the price! I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year, it lasts a very long time.  I first started using this because a ton of beauty gurus on youtube were raving about it, and having problem skin myself ( and I know I don&#x27;t take ALL of my makeup off at night), I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. The price is comparable with some well-known brands in the states (I should mention this is only available online because it is a drugstore item in France).  This is a water product so you pour a little out onto a cotton ball and wipe your face (and eye makeup) and it gets everything off.  It is non-irritating, has no perfumes or dyes so its very gentle and I&#x27;ve never had an adverse reaction on my skin or stinging in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have repurchased and would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Takes tons to really get your make up off, doesn&#x27;t take off waterproof eye make up and you still need to wash your face.  What&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Bioderma cleansing for three years, and it&#x27;s by far the best cleansing products I&#x27;ve ever used. You can use this to wipe out the makeup or dirt from your days with just 3-5 cotton puffs each time you apply. What&#x27;s better is that you can do this without any irritation (Some cleansing water products make your skin irritated a bit). You can finish cleansing real quick with this every night.</li>
    <li> Love this!&lt;br /&gt;Cleans up makeup so fast with no oily residue!</li>
    <li> recommended to me by a top makeup artist to the stars who swears by it--and now I do, too.</li>
    <li> This is the best product. I invest in my makeup because I have oily/sensitive skin. I firmly believe you get what you paid for. This solution is an exception. You get what you paid for times million.  It really erase waterproof makeup effortlessly. Hardly any residual after one swipe. I hate using oily makeup remover. This is not oily at all.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected. Product was as described. Very happy. Would use again and recommend. Was worried about authenticity after the reviews, but was all good.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It not only removes crazy amounts of makeup but it helps sooth irritated skin. My kids loved it on their sunburned cheeks.</li>
    <li> after seeing so much hype on youtube for this makeup remover, i decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;i like it because it works great for mascara &amp; stubborn eye makeup, but works great for my foundation and face makeup as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the ONLY downside to this is the taste. i put some over my lips to take off my dark red lipstick (which it got off great, no problem) but the taste was horrible. but that&#x27;s fine as long as it gets everything off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have pretty sensitive skin &amp; break out easily &amp; i have had no problem with this.&lt;br /&gt;it is expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite make up remover. I have now used ~half dozen large bottles of it and never mind the expense because it is THAT good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Gets everything off, including waterproof mascara, with one cotton.&lt;br /&gt;--Does not leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;--Is neither oily or drying.&lt;br /&gt;--Great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;--No scent.&lt;br /&gt;--Can be used as a cleanser on lazy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I use it with Shiseido cotton squares which are expensive but I can use one soaked cotton without any irritation, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY Bioderma Crealine. There is a reason why it is a cult classic with make up artists and models (who do their share of removing make up). YOU WILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Perfection... easy to use, all good ingredients, what is not to love?! Great for sensitive skin, no eye irritation and it will be my new go-to from now on.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
    <li> Melts the makeup off of your face</li>
    <li> Best product to clean your face and eyes. I don&#x27;t use any other product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for years with great results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, very effective in taking off my makeup and it&#x27;s not drying.  This is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> great product but so much more expensive than price in Europe.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like water but cleans a lot better. I would rather travel to Paris and buy it there, tho, so at least I can get a trip out of it. I heard it&#x27;s waaaaay less expensive there.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have been using it for about 9 months now and it works amazingly. I have combination skin, and this product does not dry my skin out or cause me to break out. I highly recommend this stuff as an alternative to washing your face!</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover EVER! Its the same consistency as water. I hate how other makeup removers feel like greasy oil and you can&#x27;t see anything, they are disasters. Bioderma is like a soft, gentle water, that removes makeup smoothly and effortlessly! LOVE.</li>
    <li> I really like this  makeup remover, but I have to use about 5 pads soaked in this to get my makeup off. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing, because it is expensive. But it&#x27;s great if it&#x27;s just for eye makeup, and not an all over makeup remover.</li>
    <li> removes makeup well, but wish it was thicker, find it hard to use, on a cotton pad, it&#x27;s like you have to use 20 of them to&lt;br /&gt;do face and eye makeup, but it does work, so guess I will put up with the water like consistency.</li>
    <li> I am OBSESSED with this make-up remover.  It&#x27;s the best eye and face make-up remover I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I literally come home from work and go ahead and take it off.  It leaves my skin feeling fresh.  Do yourself a favor and buy it right now.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, very comfortable, feels very natural, does not irritate the skin, to clean everyday makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> I will not use anything else as a makeup remover but this!!  It&#x27;s so gentle and leaves my face/eyes feeling refreshed!</li>
    <li> Love this product! With a simple wipe of a cotton pad, my skin maintains its smooth appearance and youthful glow. Like Paul Rudd. It&#x27;s too easy.</li>
    <li> I break out time to time, but ever since I used this cleanser before my face wash, no more breakout ever again.</li>
    <li> The vest stuff on Earth</li>
    <li> Great. Easy to use and don&#x27;t need to deep clean.</li>
    <li> The best. I have dry skin and use it in the morning. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best makeup remover I have ever used before.  After watching Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s how-to video for her makeup removal regime ([...]), I knew I had to purchase this.  I remove my makeup just how Lisa does, and it does wonders.  Having acutely dry and sensitive skin around my eyes, this product is an absolute dream!  Makeup comes off easily (waterproof does take some time) and my skin feels clean and refreshed, compared to red and aggravated as most makeup removers leave it feeling.  Not only that, since it lacks any sort of oily residue, I can use it to touch up my makeup if I make a little mistake while applying it--such as cleaning up the flick of a cat eye.  In short, buy this product.  It is amazing!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like spending so much on something like cleanser that I&#x27;ll use up quickly, but this stuff is awesome. It feels SO amazing on your skin. I have healthy skin as it is, but this made it look even better. I am so impressed and will keep buying!!!</li>
    <li> I choose this solution because it was well recommended among all the beauty bloggers.  I&#x27;m allergic to many makeup removers so I&#x27;m limited on my choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution is great.  It doesn&#x27;t sting my face or leave it red. But (and the reason for 4 stars) it does sting my eyes, if there&#x27;s too much on my cotton pad.</li>
    <li> I started with the 250ml and was not disappointed. I would buy it by the 5gal bucket and bathe in it if I could.&lt;br /&gt;It is great on my atopic skin and I have not had any sort of irritation whatsoever using this product. In fact, it has a cool and soothing effect.</li>
    <li> I discovered Bioderma Crealine in Paris last summer.  You can get it very cheap in the amazing French pharmacies.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t buy more because it&#x27;s much more expensive to get here in the states.  Amazon was the only place I could find it.  However....it does last a long time, so I made the purchase.  I use this as an eye-makeup remover.  It&#x27;s effective and very gentle on the eyes.</li>
    <li> This product really does melt off the makeup. My only problem with it is that you have to use a lot for todays more long-wearing foundations (I alternate between  mineral makeup and Tarte&#x27;s BB cream). I think I still prefer my classic Ponds cold cream, but this is a close second, especially for removing eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I love Bioderma for a lot of reasons. It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin at all. It removes ALL of my makeup and deep cleans my pores. I can use it alone and then just rinse off my face, I can use other cleansers afterward, OR just use it by itself and air dry if I have nothing else available. My only con for this product would be the price but it&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;ll keep repurchasing. I&#x27;ve already gone through 4 bottles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice on Amazon in the 500ml size, they were not fake! It is truly amazing at taking off every little dirt and all makeup (+waterproof) off so that I feel fresh and clean. I use this kind of like a toner step, after using makeup remover and a normal washing cleanser JUST to make sure and I always get some that still come off. It&#x27;s kept my skin in such a nice condition! Highly recommend for all skin types</li>
    <li> This stuff works so great for removing makeup. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like other makeup removers and hasn&#x27;t caused my skin to break out. Also lasts forever!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because Harpers Bazaar did an article about what beauty product models use and almost all of the models interviewed mentioned this.  A fantastic make-up remover/toner in one, my face feels SO fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the best makeup remover, especially for mascara/eyeliner, but I do love to use it after rubbing my face with coconut oil or cold cream. I just put some on a cotton pad and use it to remove the smeared product on my face.  Best eye makeup remover is the the Estee Lauder eye makeup remover or the Makeup Forever makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Why oh why must you be so expensive???&lt;br /&gt;This works so well and I guess price per ounce it&#x27;s really not that bad. But its a lot to shell out at once for makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best I have found that isn&#x27;t greasy. I don&#x27;t think it removes water-proof so well. But I don&#x27;t wear water-proof makeup that often.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin SO clean and its absolutely extra gentle with the skin I can almost say it hydrates while cleaning, great especially for the eye area, the best makeup remover ever, I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and i can feel this is very mild makeup remover. I really like it. My second bottle purchase already. No rinsing is necessary. However, you might need to use qtip to get a better clean around the eyeliner area since you only wipe with a makeup remover pads. Sometimes it is harder to clean around the eyeliner area with only pads. I don&#x27;t think its an issue at all. Cleans off the mascara without any problem. Highly recommend it. Better than rinsing after cleaning oil with water especially during those cold winter days.</li>
    <li> Ordered this thinking it would gentle on my sensitive skin and it was, however it didn&#x27;t take off any makeup unless I really rubbed quite hard. Terrible especially around the eye area, who wants to damage that delicate skin.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read the reviews here before purchasing this because I did not realize that this is NOT the original Crealine/Sensibio H20.  This is the \\&quot;TS\\&quot; version and the formulation/ingredients for this product are different.  I have been using the original version for a few years now and love it.  I was living in Europe and was fortunate enough to be able to get it there.  Since being back in the States I&#x27;ve been getting it through Amazon with no problems.    But the latest bottle I just received from Amazon/Omorfia Shop seemed different and so I was convinced it was a fake.  Then I did some research.  I read the ingredients and noticed they were different from my previous bottle - most notable was the addition of PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil.  The two bottles looked almost identical except for the addition of a little pink \\&quot;TS\\&quot; that I had failed to notice earlier.  So I went to the Bioderma France website, translated it, and realized my mistake.  This isn&#x27;t a fake - it&#x27;s just a different product.  It is NOT the original formula that is so raved about by everyone.  The TS version is marketed to \\&quot;very dry and sensitive\\&quot; skin types.    I&#x27;ll describe the differences between the two versions that I noticed.  I have very dry skin so you would think I might actually prefer the TS.  Nope, and I&#x27;ll tell you the biggest reason why - the TS leaves a sticky, sudsy residue on my skin that feels like it needs to be rinsed off.  When I apply lotion after, the lotion kind of mixes in with this residue and becomes slightly \\&quot;frothy\\&quot; and so then doesn&#x27;t rub smoothly into my skin.  The TS doesn&#x27;t seem to clean quite as well either, and to top it off I don&#x27;t even notice any extra moisturizing benefits.  Unless I guess you consider \\&quot;residue\\&quot; to be slightly moisturizing?  With the original Crealine/Sensibio my skin feels the same moisture-wise, but much cleaner.  More \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;, like I have nothing on my skin at all.  My skin also feels calmer using the original - I think thereis an ingredient in the TS that it doesn&#x27;t like.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works great to remove my mineral foundation and eye makeup, and is very gentle on my skin.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with Bioderma!  While this formula is the sensitive skin formula, it still works fairly well, it just doesn&#x27;t have the power to remove waterproof eye makeup like the original formula does.  I was happy to receive a real bottle (there are some fakes out there!) and it arrived sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the large size bottle, and it has lasted me over 6 months of almost daily use.  So much cheaper then spending money on pre-moistened makeup removers!</li>
    <li> I will always use this to remove eyemakeup love love love. Will use all over face as well. I take this with me when I travel will not leave home with out it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products. Really helps to get the most off my face every evening. Have used it every night since it got here but it still is almost full. A+, do recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a lifesaver for my sensitive skin! Since using it for the past year, my skin looks brighter, and I no longer have breakouts. After washing my face, I use this as a toner and it still picks up a lot of dirt and remnant make up. Obviously, it&#x27;s also a great make up remover. The bottle lasts me about 4-6 months so it&#x27;s a great investment for healthy skin!</li>
    <li> Amazing, excellent product. Gets face completely clean with no irritation. Feels like water!! Just put a few drops on a cotton pad put on eye for a few seconds and all the makeup dissolves!</li>
    <li> It was great. THANK YOU.😃</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t remove my waterproof mascara easily otherwise, still the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have stopped washing my face twice a day and drying the heck out of it. Now, I just use a cloth or clairisonic in the evening - in the morning, I use this with a cotton pad and my face is no longer as dry. No scent.</li>
    <li> Really wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. It was my first time trying something by Bioderma and I was super excited to begin using  the Micelle solution based on the reviews. If you have any kind of somewhat formidable makeup, this will not even come close to cutting it. I had originally planned to use this as my makeup removing/skin prep before washing my face with a cleanser and Clarisonic. Needless to say, I still have a lot of product left.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel very clean without drying it out.</li>
    <li> its broken when i received this</li>
    <li> This is quickly becoming my holy grail. I use it to remove make-up and even to prep my face before I wash it. It really is gentle, no noticeable scent, and cleanses very well. For my eye make-up I take a cotton pad and soak it with the Bioderma and then let it rest on my eyelid for a bit and then start gently wiping. The make-up comes off with ease. I jut wish this stuff was sold in stores here in the U.S.</li>
    <li> It took almost a month to receive the product! And I have prime membership ! The bottle looks different that I had before.</li>
    <li> I needed a gentle cleanser to remove makeup for  New York Fashion Week. This was a must have for all makeup artists backstage- it takes off makeup without irritating the models&#x27; eyes. It was perfect!</li>
    <li> This is now the only makeup remover I will buy. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it WORKS and I can pay for the less expensive stuff and it never works as well.</li>
    <li> does not remove waterproof mascara...it works well other than that. feels great and refreshing</li>
    <li> The reviews of this product and the ads I saw elsewhere made me think that this was an amazing product.  To be clear, it does remove most of my makeup (I am not a heavy makeup user but I use foundation, eyeliner and mascara everyday).  However, I have found that it is no different than any cheap makeup remover I can get in my local store.  It leaves traces of eyeliner behind and takes a lot of rubbing to remove mascara, just like most removers.  I was hoping for something a little more gentle.  I will continue to use it because I bought it already but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I finally found the best makeup remover! Gentle on eyes, no sting, and everything comes off. I used Mac wipes but traded in for Trader Joe&#x27;s which I still love. Saw this in YouTube and decided to give it a try, and glad I did.</li>
    <li> Perfect for daily eye make up removal, if you have oily under eyes. Sooo light, odorless and it does not dry the skin.</li>
    <li> The best makeup remover so far!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without Bioderma. I use it to clean my face thoroughly and it does not irritate me in the least.</li>
    <li> dries out my skin, even though it is formulated for sensitive dry skin</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my sensitive skin. Using this i no longer get that \\&quot;burn\\&quot; sensation when removing my make up. But don&#x27;t fool yourself thinking this would remove all of your eye makeup. It does a superficial job on the eyes, but i still have to use an oily eye makeup remover to get it all off before i use Crealine. It is great though and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> love love love this product!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t quite just melt off all love my wearing gel liners and mascara. Some wiping and rubbing is needed.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle that I&#x27;ve purchased; I just love it and will continue to purchase it again. Wonderful</li>
    <li> I found this product by recommendation courtesy of bubzbeauty on YouTube. Of all the makeup removers I&#x27;ve tried in the past, only oil-based ones would get all of my makeup off. But I don&#x27;t like oil-based because the oil is hard to remove! This works just as well as an oil-based makeup remover but without the fuss of oil being left on your skin. It&#x27;s certainly worth the price, because not properly removing makeup can prevent you from having the skin you wish to have!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for removing makeup at the end of the day, It doesn&#x27;t irratate my skin like some makeup removers do.</li>
    <li> Love it! Takes the makeup off gently and doesn&#x27;t leave a film.</li>
    <li> Does not remove waterproof mascara. All other makeup removes easily.</li>
    <li> great make up remover.Not oily,can take off eye make up and foundation.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover I ever come across. Period.</li>
    <li> seems fake, doesnt have the same effect than a one I bought at the store.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I could recommend this enough. I use A LOT of eye liner and mascara and this baby takes it all off in a few swipes. I never knew make up remover could work this well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it has no smell and doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s more expensive than say, an Alamy, this is money well spent.</li>
    <li> Everybody needs this in their beauty cabinet!! Smells great, works great especially for my sensitive skin &amp; eye area!! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Hooked on this stuff!  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel and removes every trace of eye makeup.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have never met a mascara I didn&#x27;t like. I wear tons of it with eyeliner and Bioderma does an excellent job of getting it all off at night. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and can&#x27;t recommend this product enough for removing makeup or using it for removing traces of makeup after washing. These absolutely no greasy feel! I call it magic water! This is one of my staples :)</li>
    <li> Beauty Bloggers reign supreme yet again with this cult product from across the pond.  I held off for a year or so before caving and pulling the trigger on Amazon.  (Love Amazon for so many reasons, but especially because I have access to retailers that carry products that are otherwise inaccessible in the US)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this amazing (gentler-than-water) cleanser daily with Shiseido Face Cotton to remove makeup and your investment will pay dividends in the way your skin looks and feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful solutions I ever use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still in the fence with this. It works great for most make-up and I use it for lipstick, doesn&#x27;t work so great on the hard to remove stuff such as waterproof makeup, fiber lashes or falsie glue.</li>
    <li> It takes all the makeup off with out leaving your face feeling dry or greasy.  I saw this online and was so happy I tried it!</li>
    <li> Bioderma is so gentle and amazing.  I use it with a cotton pad to wash my face in the morning when I have no make up to take off.  It&#x27;s also a great refresher when you can&#x27;t use water to wash -- and feel refreshed:  on a plane, when camping, etc.  Also a great make-up remover.  The amount will last you a long time and is totally worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Cleans your face and nexk very well. As well ad its gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> Purchased this just a few days ago and tried it out this evening to remove my eye makeup. Followed the simple directions of soaking a cotton ball/pad... Took everything off in one swipe! Totally worth the price and  I have very sensitive skin.. no issue</li>
    <li> I saw this as a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; on quite a few beauty blogs. I&#x27;m already on my 3rd bottle, needless to say, I love it! 4 of my friends have purchased it after trying mine. Bioderma is perfect for removing make up. I usually get a cotton pad saturated with the product, and go straight to the eyes, just take time to work off all the mascara, eyeliner, etc.. It takes everything completely off. It&#x27;s also amazing at taking off dark lipsticks without smearing color all over your face. I highly recommend it! I also use it on my skin after tweezing or using an epilator, it just cleans everything and isn&#x27;t irritating at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have a make up remover that you can use on your skin and also on your eyes. The size is great too. I recommend!</li>
    <li> I heard this is used by makeup artists to take off their models makeup, so I wanted to give it a try.  It feels like your cleaning your skin from makeup, dirt, and oil (whateves!) with water.  Its so incredibly gentle!  My skin is sooo sensitive because I use a retinoid (tazorac) so using this has been such a relief for me.  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been using products that either stung or were greasy to remove makeup.  I just never knew...this has little to no scent, has the power to wipe makeup off, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry and tight.  It&#x27;s worth the price and all the hype.</li>
    <li> I was excited to finally try the raved Bioderma, and was happy to purchase from Omorfia Shop for a reasonable price in July.  Because of Omorfia Shop&#x27;s high ratings and positive reviews, I was confident in this seller.  When I received my package, the Bioderma bottle was properly sealed, leading me to believe the product was authentic and of quality.  Unfortunately, the product could barely remove any eye, lip, and facial make-up, and after observing that regular water performed equally in removing my makeup, I was surprised that such an inefficient (and bad) product could be so hyped.  I was disappointed in Bioderma, and believed for awhile that Bioderma was just an overrated product.&lt;br /&gt;However recently in November, a friend brought me back an authentic Bioderma bottle from France, and there was absolutely no comparison between the Bioderma I purchased from Omorfia Shop and the one I received directly from France-  it was like two completely different products.  The Bioderma I received from France was amazing - it was able to remove my waterproof eye make-up, was non-sticky, and very refreshing to use, basically living up to its hype.  At this point, I realized that the bottle I purchased from Omorfia Shop back in July was either fake or expired.  I immediately emailed the seller and explained to her what happened.  Unfortunately, the seller denied me a refund or any form of compensation, and reminded me of her high seller ratings.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely received a poor quality Bioderma product from this seller, and would not have known this if it hadn&#x27;t been for my friend gifting me with an original from France.  The real Bioderma product is fantastic.  The lesson learned is to not fully trust positive seller reviews or to wait until you have tested the quality of the product before writing a review of the seller.  Do not rush to write a positive seller review.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry folks, but Omorfia Shop may just be another one of those Amazon sellers selling fake Biodermas.</li>
    <li> Lisa Eldridge the well known makeup artist recommends Bioderma.  She has a few YouTube video&#x27;s about it if you want to know more.  I&#x27;ve been using this every night for makeup removal.  It is especially good for mascara removal.  It keeps you from see sawing and rubbing excessively to loosen it.  It&#x27;s also non irritating and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover EVER. Wish it was easier to get in the states.</li>
    <li> A little problem with the shipment. The cap is cracked when I got it. The production itself is very good</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s just better make up removers out there now. Cyber colors does awesome ones.</li>
    <li> It did not leave my skin feeling as clean as I had hoped but rather felt like a coating on my skin.</li>
    <li> been a devoted Bioderma Crealine for the past 5 years.  I have an irrational fear of not cleaning my face enough -  I use this to gently wipe my face with cotton pad and I still see the make ups or dirts residue after double cleansing.  I also use this to clean my face in the morning cuz I want to reserve the natural oil produced overnight.  love it and will be a devoted user for the rest of my life?!! lol</li>
    <li> best makeup remover, frequent buyer here</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a friends suggestion.  It works well, but not as well on eyeliner.  I have to use more, or get the baby oil out.  I do like the fact that it removes all other types of make-up, foundation, eye shadow, and mascara.  It is not oily, and leaves my skin feeling clean.  I would have given 5 stars had it removed all the eyeliner.  I also noticed if I use a lot of mascara, it will sometimes leave behind a few flakes, which again, requires the baby oil coming back out of the cabinet.  I really don&#x27;t mind though.  This is an expensive product, and I will probably purchase it again.  Be careful to only use on a premium cotton pad.  That is the best way to remove  your make-up.  It will also prevent you from over filling it like you would if you were to use a cotton ball.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for long and it&#x27;s mild and does the job effectively. Like it a lot!&lt;br /&gt;Bottle was a bit leaking when received. But the plastic wrapper helped to prevent it from spilling.</li>
    <li> Cleans off makeup, nothing but a light soap smell, non irritating to my sensitive skin. I have seen a reduction in my breakouts since using it. Such a good product. Slightly drying if I don&#x27;t use moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I Like that it does take my face makeup, but I find myself using 3 cotton rounds and do a lot of rubbing. however, it takes longer for my eye makeup to be cleaned</li>
    <li> Holy Grail status. I use this as make-up remover and face wash. I have very sensitive skin, and where I live, the water is so hard. I try to avoid getting it wet more than once a day basically. This removes all of my make-up (BB cream OR MAC Studio Fix Fluid, plus concealer, etc.), and leaves my face clean. It doesn&#x27;t make my face tight, but instead, it feels moist and plump. The one caveat is that it does take longer and more effort to remove waterproof eye makeup or liquid eyeliner. An oil-based cleanser or remover would work best here; however, this is still perfect for me, as I have eyelash extensions (perfect for lazy gals like me), and you cannot put oil-based beauty products close to the lash line.</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle product. It would probably be more for a much drier skin than mine,but it cleans very well and seems non irritating for very sensitive skin. I will probably use it more in the winter.</li>
    <li> If you want a make up remover use baby oil.  Then wash your face with a cleanser and use a non alcohol toner . Works for all skin types.</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING! I heard about this product from YouTube videos and wanted to try so bad. The price is expensive but I love this product! It takes off all of my makeup really well and it doesn&#x27;t even damage my skin.</li>
    <li> Take the test... at the end of your day, wash your face as you normally would then wipe skin with a cotton pad soaked with&lt;br /&gt;Bioderma Crealine.  You will be amazed by what you find.  Bioderma Crealine removes any traces of makeup left behind from&lt;br /&gt;your usual facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup remover. It is so gentle and so incredibly effective! What I love the most about it is that it is not oily, and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue on the skin. It is perfect if you have sensitive eyes and skin, as this has no scent, and is non-irritating. I&#x27;ve tried make-up removers by Clinique, and this is much more gentle. But that doesn&#x27;t in any way affect how well it works- removes my makeup so much better than any other makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried. 100% better than Lancome&#x27;s Bifacil, and all Clinique ones. The price is great too, as you get a very large bottle for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. No wonder professional makeup artists love this so much!</li>
    <li> The best lotion/demake up I know but... can&#x27;t find it in the US a good substitute. Thanks Amazon for shipping it from France very easily.</li>
    <li> works like a charm to remove all makeup and is really gentle</li>
    <li> I use this to remove my eye make up every evening. At first i thought it was expensive, but a little goes a long way. I will buy again when mine runs out, i think it will be a while, I&#x27;m only about a quarter of the way through the bottle.</li>
    <li> I wanted to add for the previous post about this item being \\&quot;expired/fake\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This is Crealine TS H2O, NOT Crealine H2O (or Sensibio). TS is tres seches for DRY SKIN, and the sensibio/LisaE version is the original for Sensitive skin. These are two different formulas. The product is authentic, and works amazing. Shipping was fast. The price is also super reasonable!</li>
    <li> This solution is amazing! It&#x27;s the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very sensitive and acne prone skin. This removes ALL of my makeup and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It&#x27;s also great for fixing makeup mistakes. Just put a little bit on a q-tip and use that to fix things.</li>
    <li> Quickly and painlessly removes the toughest mascara and water-proof makeup without tugging at your delicate skin in the eye area.  I like to use it on the round cotton pads, rather than a cotton ball, one for each eye.  For quickest and best results, I saturate a pad, hold it on my closed eye for a few seconds to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; the mascara, and then wipe away clean.  It&#x27;s also great for touch-ups with a Q-tip if you get mascara blobs or other eye makeup disasters.  Does not leave any greasiness behind.</li>
    <li> This is great for sensitive skin. My skin is very easily agitated and this has not harmed or irritated my skin in any way. It also removes make up without using too much force. I recommend using a cotton pad and just lightly press again eye sockets to remove eye make up and clean up remaining make up that is soften by Bioderma Crealine for easy removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also does not use oil! It does not feel greasy and irritate the eye. Very good product for an exceptional price. I usually use Gen Koh Do&#x27;s spa water which also works great but Bioderma Crealine is a lot cheaper for practically the same quality!</li>
    <li> I have to say I am honestly surprised as to how gentle this is for eye makeup removal and yet SO EFFECTIVE!! I will recommend this to anyone with skin sensitivities, especially around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great for sensitive skin. Takes makeup off very well and I love that there no need for water.</li>
    <li> Amazing and easy to use... it&#x27;s clean your face deeply.</li>
    <li> There was no padding in the package, as a result the lid was broken.</li>
    <li> Very great and cheap product</li>
    <li> One of my biggest disappointments.  With all the good reviews out there, I decided to give it a try. The skin feels fresh and hydrated after I used it, BUT the main thing I bought it for was to remove my make up in a gentle way and it did not remove my make up at all. Avon has pretty good make up removers, I will stick with those and use this one in the mornings for the freshness before a workout.</li>
    <li> Apothekary add falsely makes it seems that the price is for a pack of two.  what&#x27;s weird is that it&#x27;s $29 for one but $124 for two!!!  How is that for bad math??  Love the product but will not buy from this seller ever again!</li>
    <li> I use a cleansing water before washing my face, so I don&#x27;t need one that leaves my skin 100% squeaky clean. I just really like to take my makeup off before I wash my face. I had previously been using the Koh Gen Do Spa Cleansing Water, which I loved. However, it was $13 for three ounces so it was becoming pretty expensive. The Bioderma works just as well, if not slightly better, for me and is gentle enough to use on my eyes. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase this when I run out as it&#x27;s more economical and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Love. Love. Love. Cleared my skin up within a week.</li>
    <li> The best make up remover ever. Wonderful for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;The best option to remove water proof eye mascara and ultra pigmented eye shadow.</li>
    <li> This is the best, most gentle makeup remover I have tried. I was previously using a similar product made by Benefit Cosmetics, but this one is better. It removes more makeup.</li>
