<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This peel works great! I have &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; or fine lines and I am amazed at how well this stuff works. It really faded those pesty wrinkles! It went on smooth, no greasy feeling or residue. It was gentle enough on my skin and worked quickly. What more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> Skin Patch Test&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always do a skin patch test before applying the Salicylic Peel Solution. Licensed professionals scientifically designed this product for use according to the specific directions, Prior to the use of this product. the home care system must be used for optimum results. Salicylic Acid quickly and efficiently removes dead skin cells that clog pores and makes the skin dull. Frequent use of an exfoliator promotes circulation and maintains a younger skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application of the Product&lt;br /&gt;You may use the peel on your hands, face, neck, or anywhere you have a problem with Hyper-pigmentation (age spots) Acne, Wrinkles, Scare Tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 Cleanse the face, neck, and hands with Cleanser with a tissue, cotton ball or Sponge. rinse the cleanser with clean warm water and gently pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 Apply Toner to remove all traces of the cleanser and let dry, do not rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3 Apply a small amount of Salicylic Peel Solution with a brush, cotton ball or fingertips to the area cleansed and toned. Leave on for recommended amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended Time Schedule&lt;br /&gt;First Peel Product left on for 1 minute&lt;br /&gt;Second Peel Product left on for 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Third Peel Product left on for 3-5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Fourth Peel Product left on for 5-6 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Fifth Peel Product left on for 6-8 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Sixth Peel Product left on for 8-10 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general recommendation is every 4 weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 4 Rinse product from skin with cool clean water and pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 5 Apply Glycolic Moisturizing Cream to treated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this a few times. I have had no major problems with peeling. The only problems I had was no instruction with the product. I received an email with how to apply and use. I&#x27;ve notice some change in how my skin looks. I will continue to use until all gone. Long term use should improve my skin greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Very good for adult acne. It dries out the cystic acne and sometime stops it from forming altogether. Note: for this effect you have to use it everyday on the affected patches of skin and don&#x27;t wash it off.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Not too strong and stingy.</li>
    <li> Since it is recommended to first do a small skin patch test to minimize risk that is what I did. I applied a light coating with a botton ball on a small spot of my hand. I left it on for only about a minute. Then rinsed off well with cold water. Afterwards I could feel a warming sensation on my hand. Later I noticed that I had a smoother spot of skin where I did the spot test. I didn&#x27;t experience any peeling. Like I said, I was very leery about doing it so didn&#x27;t do a very big spot. So far I don&#x27;t have a problem and plan on trying it next on another spot of skin. I would strongly recommend to follow all of the instructions you get from Dr. Song before using this product. Everyone has different results and you can seriously burn your skin since this is a chemical peel.&lt;br /&gt;I received free product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Great service and product availability.&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived as promised and I would recommend this supplier to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Jim K</li>
    <li> I started by washing my face, and opening my pores, than used a alcohol wipe to clear my face of any residing oils. Then, I applied the peel using a cotton ball, stating my timer for 1 minute. Do not be alarmed if it looks like you have a white frost on your face, that&#x27;s just the peel crystallizing, as salicylic acid does. As far as any pain/burning goes, this was not as bad as the lactic acid peel I did, my face felt hot, and itchy. I did manage to leave it on for 1 minute, but instead of using baking soda to neutralize, I just used cold water and a towel to remove, than applied my toner. After which, I applied a moisturizer with SPF in it.  Keep in mind, you should be cautious of the sun as your face will be sensitive. After the peel my face was red for just a few minutes, I did this last night, and I noticed the redness of my acne, starting to fade. I did have a small pimple, that came to a head after applying the peel. My pores are noticeably smaller, and my breakouts have clearly, reduced in size and color, they aren&#x27;t red, the peel dried them out, and they are starting to go away.  Not an overnight cure by any means, but like I said. CLOSE!  I am so impressed with how well this works, and the results I have experienced in just one evening. I highly recommend this to anyone with acne, or large pores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complementary product received for review, regardless all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> gooooooood stuff right here</li>
    <li> I really, really like this…but PLEASE read the instructions. This is meant to be used sparingly. Recommended use is 4 weeks between each peel (when talking about the same area). The Precautions in the directions need to be taken seriously, you could burn yourself!&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin so I usually try to stay away from salicylic acid products but I was very interested after reading reviews. I did a bit of research before using this and was prepared for the possible issues of overuse. The first time I used it, I followed the instructions to a T…I did a skin patch test first, seemed okay so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I made sure I was working with a clean face. Then I applied a small amount of the salicylic acid to a brush and applied directly to the area of the latest and greatest adult-acne breakout I had. There was a little burning while it was on, but nothing I couldn’t handle. After a minute, I rinsed with cool water. Followed that with some serum and moisturizer. The cluster of pimples were practically gone!  There was a little peeling for a few days after but to be rid of a cluster of pimples like that was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I want to stress that overuse WILL cause burning and even blisters. Luckily, I read enough reviews to scare me into the recommended use, especially because I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product but do stress the importance of following instructions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received in exchange for an honest review*</li>
    <li> I really like this! I enjoy using this product maybe once a month and it helps improve the texture of my skin slightly and heal up some existing acne a bit more quickly.  Make sure you follow the instructions closely and this would be best for you if you have already had experience with acid facial products.</li>
    <li> This is crap. I could leave this on my face and it wouldnt do a thing.....ive done good peels where I at least get a good frosting. Dont waste your time or money!!</li>
    <li> So far this is my favorite. I saw better color and an improvement in my acne scars. Looking Better!!</li>
    <li> This stuff gets my skin so soft and smooth and one little bottle lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I have acne and light scarring as well as large pores (genetic)and suffer constant blackheads. I am also prone to inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this over other Amazon offerings as the solution was simple. A peel is sensitizing enough without added, unnecessary ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients-and a breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;SD 40 alcohol-solvent&lt;br /&gt;propylene glycol-enhances penetration of the active ingredient, humectant/conditioner,and stability of the  overall product&lt;br /&gt;glycerin-humectant, buffering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before application, I apply coconut oil around my eyes, working it in between the lashes and around the socket. I also coat my lips. I use a (clean) panty liner, folded on itself to apply the solution as the texture was less abrasive and retained the product better for even distribution than cotton balls. The sensation was less intense than what I expected, and as I am used to acne treatments, not at all unpleasant or harsh. I left it on for 2-2 1/2 minutes than neutralized with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and water. Rinse with copious amounts of cool water to remove the neutralizer, and blot dry. I followed with more coconut oil, Juice Beauty Tinted Moisturizer SPF 30, and enough Badger Balm All Season Face Stick [Unscented, broad spectrum zinc oxide 22.5%]to give my face a white cast. As the day progresses or I feel dryness where the moisturizers have absorbed, I re-apply an oil based serum and the sun block stick.&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is packing and packaging. I know plastics are capable of handling chemicals, but would prefer a brown glass bottle. Store this away from sunlight/heat. The second is that the bottle was shipped inside a box with styrofoam peanuts-and not enough at that. No damage to box or bottle however.&lt;br /&gt;I will update after additional applications.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for new facial peels to try out in order to keep my skin looking young and healthy. The serum is easy to apply and I let it sit for the directions on the package. It does burn slightly but nothing that seems too much. More of a, healthy burn... It peels off and than for the next 2-3 days my face peels and my skin is so much softer. It&#x27;s very refreshing and along with exfoliating, I think it&#x27;s a great product. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to brighten and add more youth to their skin. I also love the fact that I can get a good 15-20 peels out of it instead of just one peel like other expensive bottles.</li>
    <li> An excellent product sold by a company with stellar customer service.</li>
    <li> This product damaged my skin and hurt very badly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use this for my acne and it keeps me clear.  I&#x27;m allergic to benzoyl peroxide and 2% salicylic acid washes are too weak for me, so I&#x27;m really glad I found this peel.  I only need to do a peel once every 2 weeks and use a 2% wash regularly on top of doing a peel and I don&#x27;t break out anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this peel for my acne scars and acne for about 2 months now, and my face has completely cleared up along with my scars begining to diminish.  It is a peel though, so be careful not to burn yourself.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived on time and was nicely packaged. The product works exactly as advertised. The price is the best part of all.</li>
    <li> This product did not do its intended use (molluscum treatment), but it&#x27;s an obviously high quality peel. Packaging is great, and the applicator is quite large, which makes it easy to apply to a small or large area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m in need of a peel in the future, I will reorder.</li>
    <li> I love the produce.  It did what it claim.  I would repurchase this product again in the future. The company even sent a 20% coupon off for future purchase of a produce. Thanks</li>
    <li> I like that it is a liquid gel consistency. It makes it easy to control application which allows for greater safety and less is wasted because you can use a gloved finger to apply, whereas with the other peels that are the consistency of water, a lot is wasted applying it with a cotton ball, yet it is difficult to apply safely without one. The consistency of this product worked very well for me - it was thin enough to spread around your skin evenly, yet viscous enough to not drip off your skin or into your eyes (at least not unless you apply too much).</li>
    <li> It is ok, very useful.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week and leave on for only a few minutes.  It really cleared up my face.  I also got my husband hooked on it!  Be careful it is strong and it does burn.</li>
    <li> I have used the 20% Salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the product very much! with the first use it made my skin a&lt;br /&gt;little more even toned and with the second use it is even better. I&lt;br /&gt;have some discolorations and uneven skin tone and it is already&lt;br /&gt;working to help lighten the excess pigmentation. It has unclogged my&lt;br /&gt;pores somewhat already and the little bumps that I had underneath the&lt;br /&gt;top layers of skin are now almost gone after just 2 uses. I have used&lt;br /&gt;many other products but find that this one works better for me, I like&lt;br /&gt;the consistency of your brand it is not as watery as others I have&lt;br /&gt;tried and is gel based which is good when you are putting it on your&lt;br /&gt;face it has less running and I find that you have to use less also.&lt;br /&gt; I will stick with this brand because it works! and I like the way you&lt;br /&gt;offered it for a great introductory price to try it, I have spent so&lt;br /&gt;much money in the past only to find out I didn&#x27;t like the products&lt;br /&gt;that much and then have been stuck with them,....now I don&#x27;t have to&lt;br /&gt;worry about that anymore because I have found what works and I will be&lt;br /&gt;sticking with it.&amp;#34; I LOVE DR SONG SALICYLIC ACID&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Dr. Song&#x27;s gel peels the 20% and the 50% were wonderful I have both products and have been using it. with in a few days I can see a much smoother skin and so soft to the touch. I am so happy with the Launch Price that I had the chance to take advantage of buying and testing a new product line by Dr. Song. there product is with high quality. so are there customer service representative. always conducting professionalism most of all a HIGH QUALITY of care towards all there customers ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  thank you.&lt;br /&gt;  G.Kelley</li>
    <li> I used to get Chemical Peels and Microdermabrasion Treatments all the time. I love how my skin looks and feels after getting these treatments, but let&#x27;s all be honest - they tend to get pretty expensive. I am very happy that nowadays, there are trustworthy brands like Dr. Song, that makes Solutions and Peels that I can use at home. It is very convenient and inexpensive compared to the treatments that I used to pay for! I love how it works on my sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.

    <li> After a lot of trial and error, I now use this salicylic acid daily to keep my face looking clear and smooth! I add a very small amount to my moisturizer before applying and allow about 10 minutes before applying makeup. Be sure  to pay attention to your skin&#x27;s reaction after using this acid, as you may need to only use 1x weekly for awhile, then gradually increasing the duration. Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> I think this works pretty well. I feel like my skin is not great, but I recently had surgery and was unable to use this product for a few weeks, and I really saw a difference - clogged pores galore! So it seems like it does a good job of keeping pores fairly clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat - do not apply too close to lips or nostrils! It really does burn.</li>
    <li> I make my own serum and adding this just enhances the effect.  So far I am happy with this product I thought it would be harsh but so far ive had no adverse effects. I use it with a mixture of other ingredients for a night serum.</li>
    <li> The item came without a box (shown in the product photo), which was already suspect. To make the matter worse, the bubble wrap wrapping the glass bottle had a nose hair with a booger attached to it (I am not kidding!). I couldn&#x27;t believe how unprofessional it all was. The product also didn&#x27;t include any instructions. I&#x27;m chucking the product in the trash. With such horrible packaging, I&#x27;m suspicious of the product and don&#x27;t want to take a chance with my face.</li>
    <li> The item arrived very promptly. I find it to be effective and is not harsh on my skin and I&#x27;m very sensitive so that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try a chemical peel for a while now and a salicylic acid peel seemed right for me as I&#x27;m oily in the T zone and get the occasional break out.  Well this defiantly does what it claims.  It takes the top layer of dead skin off and Im confident over  months the claims are accurate.  I would say it has a much more burning sensation than claimed- I could only leave it on for half of the recommended time for the first application ( and I don&#x27;t consider myself having sensitive skin). Perhaps that is because I exfoliate regularly.  The only draw back for me is that my face was peeling for over 1 week which was embarrassing at work.  I expected the process to take 3-4 days not 8.  This would not stop me from using the product again however, next time I will allow more time before my face needs to look good.  After the peeling stopped my face felt smoother and more clear.  Does seem to agitate active acne a bit ( no surprise there).  It is nice to have this type of product for at home use for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> A must have for those with ACNE.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will be buying more once I run out.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for my acne that I sometimes get along my neckline. It only requires a very small amount dabbed on your oily areas . I do it every other day. This will cause peeling from the skin so you will want to use it sparingly and not every day.I wish i had known about this product way before I turned 40+.&lt;br /&gt; This is the only acne solving product you will ever need.</li>
    <li> Terribly disappointed!  The product came with no instructions, and can not find out anywhere how to use it. it still sits in my drawer.  I tried to follow the directions was not able to access the site. HELP please!!  How can you send an acid peel and not send instructions as to how to use the product.  It&#x27;s so nuts.  please contact me!!</li>
    <li> My face is sensitive so cannot speak to impact.  Applied to hands two times, they never peeled at all.  Not sure why.  Maybe keeping it on longer will help but I did not want to overdue it.</li>
    <li> The first time that I used this product, I left it on for only 45 seconds because I got scared of the burning sensation. But when I took it off, the results were amazing. Smaller pores, less oily, and some of my acne came to a head after I rinsed the peel off. All around a great product but please use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Cleared my skin instantly of bumps and blemishes!</li>
    <li> Great results visible within the first day, even better after 1 week. Cleared up breakout.</li>
    <li> Really don&#x27;t see anything that it does.  It burns at first but then nothing.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> product came in a huge box for such a small product.  ironically, it didn&#x27;t come with content brochure and/or instructions.  given the high concentration of 20% salicylic acid, i think it&#x27;s dangerous to dispense it without instructions.  it can cause harm to unknowing customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the gel form makes it easier to use.</li>
    <li> Very good product, saw results within a couple days. My face is a brighter and a lot smoother.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this product. The gel is superior to the others I&#x27;ve tried. Easy to apply without a cotton ball absorbing too much of it. My only complaint is the lid and dropper. The lid leaks, so it&#x27;s hard to travel with and using the dropper with gel was a bit awkward at first, the dropper is growing on me, but the leaking lid is unfortunate. All in all, my acne is going away since I&#x27;ve started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this and a benzoyl peroxide gel at night, and a non-comedogenic aloe-vera lotion in the mornings.</li>
    <li> The product is very good, but the bottle sucks. The lid leaks. I&#x27;ll order again despite the crap top.</li>
    <li> I was very nervous to usethi at first... but it was not too harsh and is working well for me!</li>
    <li> Great peel will buy again</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I already notice a difference after just a few weeks. My skin is more clear and smooth.</li>
    <li> I really am in LOVE with this peel! I&#x27;ve been using it about twice a week &amp; it makes my skin look sooooo very fabulous &amp; I am really starting to see some serious improvement in my complexion. It&#x27;s like a facial in a bottle &amp; makes my skin so, so soft &amp; super glowy in a good way :):)</li>
    <li> Great price, good product.</li>
    <li> When I first got the chance to try out Dr. Song the first thing I thought to myself &amp;#34;well time to stock up on face lotion&amp;#34;.  While I love using Acid peels they usually dry out my skin like crazy and I am lathering on the lotion.  I was excited to find out this was a thicker gel.  While it took a little while longer to soak into my skin it did not dry out my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;  This peel is great for improving wrinkles and even helps with some types of acne.  You can now have your chemical peel right in your own home while relaxing.  This one is also so much gentler on your skin then the harsh other ones I have used.  It helped my skin and gave it a more even look and feel but at the same time left it glowing.  I did not get any red dry spots at all. This is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who is looking to even out their skin and help with wrinkles this is the way to go.  It is easy to use just a pump or two on your finger and work into the skin after you wash it.  It’s that simple and I started to see the effects of this fantastic gel in the first week.</li>
    <li> This peel by Dr Song contains 20% salicylic acid. At a high concentration level, salicylic acid acts as a peeling agent dissolving the top layer of the epidermis and resurfaces the skin. This results in a smoother and more glowing complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic Acid is a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA). It is a highly effective peeling agent that is an oil reducer and pore cleanser. Salicylic acid is ideal for oily and acne prone skin. You can use peels to improve wrinkles, acne and remove warts on your skin. It also helps with psoriasis and ingrown hairs. It can also be beneficial for dry and dehydrated skin, sun damaged, and dull skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the peel to my skin and let it set for one minute. It has a slight alcohol odor but it’s not strong at all. The liquid is clear and thick. It glides on smoothly. I started to notice a very slight tingle when I removed the peel. It was hardly noticeable. I instantly noticed that my face was glowing. My skin felt smoother. It’s like it filled in my wrinkles. My skin felt more refreshed. Some may notice your skin will start to peel in about 1 to 2 days after initial use. That is all the bad skin starting to flake off. I didn&#x27;t notice too much peeling but it may be because I used a very little amount for my first time. I have not used a peel that was this concentrated before so I wanted to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t have any bad reactions. After 2 days, I noticed that my skin was really glowing. I even got compliments on how beautiful my skin looked. I love how smooth it left my skin. I received this product to test in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I look forward to using this product every month!</li>
    <li> This feels like it would be really scary to use, but as long as you&#x27;re careful, it&#x27;s really not too dangerous. Honestly, it&#x27;s like the treatments that dermatologists provide, but charge a ton for, in my opinion! Just read the directions on the company&#x27;s website, and you&#x27;ll be ready to help clear your skin! The only thing I worried about was the Salicylic acid would dry my skin out too much, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems!</li>
    <li> Only used it once but I can tell it has brought my blackheads to the surface.</li>
    <li> I have acne and decided to try this peel, I was not disappointed with the results. My skin was smoother and clearer after my peel. I have used stronger peels before and was able to keep it on for 5 minutes. However I recommend using a good skin hydrator ( I used 100% aloe vera gel) this helps with peeling.</li>
    <li> This stuff reduced my breakout by alot. However note, I have mild- low moderate acne. The only reason I gave this product 3 stars is, because after 3 minutes of having it on my skin peeled consistantly badly for at least a week after. I used this product for 3 months, and the peeling time didn&#x27;t diminish. I also tried for 2 and 1 minute(s), and the peeling stopped, along with the diminish in breakouts.</li>
    <li> The peel was  good, and delivered the expected results. I used it a couple of times, and did not experience any skin sensitivity. I like the fact that the consistency was a bit thicker, which made it easier to keep on the surface area. I sued it mostly on my body, and only on portions of my face.</li>
    <li> product came as described and was brand new. Instructions were emailed to me. I have been using it for 3 weeks so far and haven&#x27;t noticed a change. It does burn while it&#x27;s on and then I notice my skin will peel a few days later and was noted.</li>
    <li> Great product, makes skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The gel is much easier to control than the liquids that I usually use. It feels nice on my skin and it mixes well with other Acid peels and makes them easier to control as well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin in ONE WEEK!  I love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I am pleased with the customer service and product quality.&lt;br /&gt;I used the product following instructions and have now included the peel into my skin care routine because of the difference I could see in only a few days after initial use/application.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions and use this product. Best choice for visible results. I am 61 yo female and this product is great in minimizing the pores and smoothing my face as well as fighting small acne outbreaks.</li>
    <li> It comes in a glass bottle with an easy to use dropper. The salicylic acid does a great job of getting into your pores and helping blockages to surface. The 20% isn&#x27;t so strong that someone new to acid peels couldn&#x27;t use it, but if you have open acne lesions it will sting when you apply it! This is a really great product for people who want to try a salicylic peel to see if it improves their skin, as I have noticed big improvement in my cystic acne since I began using this peel.</li>
    <li> Eh. not impressed, not strong enough for the purpose I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Too soon to give an accurate assessment.</li>
    <li> Order came quickly, as promised.  Email came instructing how to apply.  The peel burned, and left a couple of red splotches, although I only began to peel slightly after six days.  It does seem that it will fade my dark spots and my skin was smooth after the application.</li>
    <li> I had to use this a few times before i saw results. After that my skin was less scarred, clear. It does cause irritation and be prepared for your skin to stay red and blotchy for about a day.</li>
    <li> Dr. Song Gel Peel is made with pharmaceutical grade salicylic acid that is FDA compliant cosmetic laboratory. With in each bottle you get 15 - 20 full facial peels depending on the size and area in which you are covering. With the bottle being 30 ml or 1 fl. oz that is a great thing. This peel is best to help take care of acne, acne scars, wrinkles, large pores. blackheads and not to forget oily skin, psoriasis, razor bumps even warts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this gel peel will work different for everyone you should still follow/read the directions fully before applying it to your whole face area. If you are still a bit worried there is always the test patch much like dying hair. Just applying a small amount on a small area of the face and follow as if it were the whole face. Now some people like I said about will react different some may have little to no stinging while other will have pins all over. Some will not see much peeling until a few hours to days later. So do not freak or worry just let it work and if you start to have a bad reaction remove as soon as possible and maybe call your physician to see if there should be more done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a bit fearful of using this on my nose so when I test this I used it only on my forehead and the area around my nose. I felt a good amount of tingle especially in areas that I have plucked (ei: eyebrows and bridge area between). So I would suggest if you have any open areas or just plucked or waxed wait a bit for doing this. But I felt smoother and a bit tighter faced afterward. I peeled a little but more the following days. I feel I would have to use it a bit more to get use to it and see more of a difference complexion wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
