      <li>/&gt;What was surprising (and nice!)</li>
      <li>Just got it and started to use it, will see how well it works, hopeing for good results, sounds good</li>
      <li>To get a good lather, I would squeeze the cleanser onto the palm of your hands and then rub your hands together to create a lather, and then apply to face.  </li>

      <li>I find the scent pleasant, and it does as good a job as a cleanser as most shower gels.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I used it on my face and body, and I liked how my skin felt after.</li>
      <li>I have liked everything Biore has ever made and this is no exception.  </li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think steam did anything for this cleanser</li>
      <li>in all, this is a nice cleaner.  </li>
      <li>liked the cleanser a lot.</li>
      <li>The fragrance was kind of herbal and clean-smelling without smelling of detergent.</li>
      <li>you rub it in, it gives off a nice fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I looked at Target and Walmart and couldn&#x27;t find it, which was discouraging until I found it on good ole Amazon :)</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot to create a nice lather.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the mint that gives a nice tingly sensation in the steam - and gives the face a nice refreshed feeling.  </li>
      <li>Plus, all of the chemical ingredients are kind of a put off for me.</li>
      <li>I like the stand-up cap which sits nicely in my shower.  </li>
      <li>It lather ups really nice</li>
      <li>If you want squeaky clean skin that feels great, try this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great marketing though, and if Biore was the first to come up with it, good for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I enjoy the tingling sensation from the menthol and find the smell to be quite pleasant.</li>
      <li>It lathers nicely, smells good, and rinses away cleanly.  </li>
      <li>and it was refreshing and nicely scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a nice and refreshing cleanser made by Biore.  </li>
      <li>Plus, you can kinda feel the tingly in the steam which is nice :)  </li>
      <li>I see incredible results and fewer blemishes...not really.  </li>
      <li>and I have very fair, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Okay ... I don&#x27;t believe the hype about the steam activation.</li>
      <li>but I still see blackheads and dirt in many of my pores.  </li>
      <li>Too many products promise \\&quot;pore cleaning power\\&quot; in one form or another, yet none deliver on it.</li>
      <li>So, if you&#x27;re okay with rubbing lotion on your face every day, this will probably work well for you.</li>
      <li>It gets my face feeling nice and smooth, but takes a bit of water to get the lather off.  </li>
      <li>It works great and leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean with no oily or greasy residue.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t perform any steam tricks as advertised, but it does get your face nice and clean.  </li>
      <li>that I have that out of my system, the cleanser is actually pretty good.</li>
      <li>I found it washes off fairly easily</li>
      <li>I also am prone to little blackheads on my nose and an oily T-zone, and this keeps my pores looking flawless.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It washed off quick and skin is very clean.  </li>
      <li>I have a huge problem with oily skin.</li>
      <li>when she bought the cleansing strips from the same brand, she also recieved a sample of the steam activated cleanser and was happy that it worked in the shower.</li>
      <li>It actually has a nice tingle on the skin, but I honestly was hoping that I could&#x27;ve felt a bit more warmth from the cleanser on my first use.</li>
      <li>It is a tingly, cool feeling on the skin and washes easily and cleanly away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a favorite of mine over all the higher end products.</li>
      <li>I am usually a fan Biore products, but I haven&#x27;t been impressed with the Steam Activated Cleanser.</li>
      <li>But a good warm shower, with all that steam and total moisture, really seems to activate something in this cleanser that otherwise doesn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
      <li>It did, however, make my face feel clean after using it</li>
      <li>but I do like knowing and feeling that my face is clean.</li>
      <li>My face felt refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
      <li>and it did leave a clean feeling on my face.</li>
      <li>up - your face is clean.  </li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this product&#x27;s ability to clean out my pores and, say, soap and water.</li>
      <li>, I think that is a gimmick to make it seem special.  </li>
      <li>It rinses off quickly and cleanly, leaving my skin nice and soft.</li>
      <li>The scent used in this facial cleanser smells good too.</li>
      <li>was the cool and tingly feeling if it on my face.</li>
      <li>It definitely took care of the oily skin giving it a good wash.</li>
      <li>and it gets full of water in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, not a bad cleanser.</li>
      <li>It had a minty fresh clean scent to it.</li>
      <li>If it was advertised as a normal cleanser, I would give it higher marks as it is nice and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like that this cleanser cleans my face without drying it out and making my face look much more vibrant</li>
      <li>I love many of Biore&#x27;s products and my daily face wash is from their line.</li>
      <li>For Biore&#x27;, they have amde some very strong products that&#x27;ve worked pretty well on the face, like their classic pore strips.</li>
      <li>I use it in the shower where it is easy to get the steam action opening my pores and the easy wash off of the shower.</li>
      <li>The result is an incredible deep clean that I rarely experience with other cleansers, complete with a nice after-tingle on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it does still work nicely on the skin.</li>
      <li>This is a nice invigorating facial cleanser with a minty smell.  </li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be technically correct, this cleanser is warm water activated, steam is 100 degrees Celsius, a lot hotter than the mist in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, this cleanser has a nice, fragrant scent, but it does have just a hint of a chemical scent.</li>
      <li>The end result is soft smooth skin that feels ultra clean and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s intended for use in a steamy shower but also works well with splashes of hot water or a very hot washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I put the Biore cleanser on my face and washed it off right before the end of my shower and my skin felt so invigorated after I using the cleanser.</li>
      <li>I rub it in with my fingers and it foams gently and rinses off cleanly, without leaving a film.  </li>
      <li>but this is probably too strong for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, easy to rinse off, and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
      <li>I feel super clean and soft after using this but never too drying on my skin.</li>
      <li>I enjoy trying their different products and was excited to try the Steam Activated Cleanser.</li>
      <li>My face felt clean and fresh, but not tight after using this.</li>
      <li>was in the shower for a couple of minutes as the water was getting hot and grabbed this bottled.  </li>
      <li>you need is hot steamy water and this cleanser.</li>
      <li>This is a product that I would most likely purchase again.</li>
      <li>I love a really hot bath, so my skin is softer and my pores are open.</li>
      <li>I got this as a sample with the Biore pore strips and instantly fell in love.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the way the steam activated cleanser cleans.  My skin feels dry and smooth afterwards.  The weird thing is, that the product is kind of gummy.  If you massage it over your mouth or nose, it will create a kind of bubble which either makes it difficult to breathe or you get a bunch of it in your mouth.  The solution is carefully spread the cleanser over your face so that it doesn&#x27;t block your nostrils or mouth. Ultimately, Garnier, Expert Exfoliator, is better.[[ASIN:B0050I2VTA Garnier The Expert Exfoliator Daily Exfoliating Gel, 5 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> No results at all. Just a gel.</li>
    <li> When it has came down to many cleansers, they don&#x27;t always do what they say they are going to do. It does take a lot out of you to find the best in your skin. For Biore&#x27;, they have amde some very strong products that&#x27;ve worked pretty well on the face, like their classic pore strips. But, they have a few new tricks up their sleve with the new steam activated cleanser. It actually has a nice tingle on the skin, but I honestly was hoping that I could&#x27;ve felt a bit more warmth from the cleanser on my first use. Overall, it does still work nicely on the skin. I was expecting a bit better from the Biore&#x27; steam cleanser, but it still isn&#x27;t a bad way to wash your worries away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: B-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Care: B-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: B-</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample with the Biore pore strips and instantly fell in love.  I am constantly on the search for something that works well but not over drying.  I have moderate acne (especially for 25 years old)and in two washes it cleared everything up and had the perfect amount of anti-oil but not overdrying.  Plus, you can kinda feel the tingly in the steam which is nice :)  I looked at Target and Walmart and couldn&#x27;t find it, which was discouraging until I found it on good ole Amazon :)</li>
    <li> This cleanser did not really help with black heads like I hoped but it did keep my acne away. Lasted a long time too!</li>
    <li> Before buying the steam activated cleanser for my daughter, she used many cleansers that were uneffective and a waste of money. when she bought the cleansing strips from the same brand, she also recieved a sample of the steam activated cleanser and was happy that it worked in the shower. So I bought her the whole thing and she uses it when she gets home afterschool. She told me to recommend this product for other girls so that they wouldn&#x60;t have their faces feeling oily.</li>
    <li> bought this for my granddaughter,who has some acne problems.she has used other biore products that works.and the steam activated also has help .she likes the cleanser.</li>
    <li> This product makes your face feel so refreshed and great! You must use this in the shower with steam, seriously it makes a difference, you really do feel the change on your face. I love this product!!</li>
    <li> my daughter prefers this over X out</li>
    <li> I love it! You can really feel it working with all the steam in the shower. It&#x27;s definitely a favorite of mine over all the higher end products.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! I tend to have oily skin in my tzone and normal on my cheeks. I use this about every other day while in the shower. I feel super clean and soft after using this but never too drying on my skin. It keeps my skin clear in addition to my astringent. A little goes a long way with me.</li>
    <li> Yes Its great, My skin looks great!</li>
    <li> Not a lot to say... Only that is works as advertised. All the cleansers of this type have the same ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Just got it and started to use it, will see how well it works, hopeing for good results, sounds good</li>
    <li> I bought this product in cvs. I want to buy a biore blackhead cleaser but I didnt buy it. Because its clear my skin, control oil, and visible blackhead. now my skin look pretty.</li>
    <li> (This review was written by my wife) I have used different Biore products since I was in high school.  This one seems to work well.  I enjoy the tingling sensation from the menthol and find the smell to be quite pleasant. It foams up well if you rub it in your hands before spreading it on your face.  I don&#x27;t know if the \\&quot;steam activated\\&quot; part really works but I have found that the tingling isn&#x27;t as noticeable if the shower isn&#x27;t very steamy.  I like the stand-up cap which sits nicely in my shower.  This is a product that I would most likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Bior&amp;eacute; Steam Activated Cleanser is a thick clear gel with blue crystals.  It&#x27;s intended for use in a steamy shower but also works well with splashes of hot water or a very hot washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts out with a pleasant and subtle fruity tropical smell and then when it is massaged into the skin, develops a moderate minty odor and then a menthol scent and a little tingly sensation.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any abrasive qualities.  The scent rinses off and doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser does an excellent job removing grime from oily skin at the face and neck and behind the ears but may be too harsh for dry or even normal skin.  Even an hour after using this, my pores are small and my face feels tight at the cheeks and forehead.  I don&#x27;t mind that effect at all but this is probably too strong for people with sensitive skin.  This may be better for that occasional spa day self-pampering experience than as an everyday facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> Sometimes an idea seems so obvious that you wonder why it hasn&#x27;t been thought of before. That&#x27;s how I felt about the Steam Activated Biore Cleanser. A bathtub cleanser is brilliant. I love a really hot bath, so my skin is softer and my pores are open. You always wash your face in the bathtub anyway, so why not use Biore cleanser? It works great and leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean with no oily or greasy residue.</li>
    <li> I always use face washes, instead of soap, in the shower. This Biore product comes out as a cool gel with a few micro-beads, you are supposed to rub it into your skin and make it lather to get the steam to activate the cleaning power. My face felt clean and fresh, but not tight after using this. I like this cleanser and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I received totally different bottle of cleanser. It does not really work and tingles when I use it. It does leave my skin fresher but that&#x27;s it about this cleanser and blackheads do not dissappear</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think steam did anything for this cleanser, I think that is a gimmick to make it seem special.  It did, however, make my face feel clean after using it - so with that, I think its job is complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sensitive, often dry bskin was not irritated, red, burning, or otherwise harmed by this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 38 and I have very fair, sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used this cleanser a few times and unfortunately each time I experienced dry, itchy, red irritated skin a few hours after I used it. I&#x27;m disappointed because I really like the minty, invigorating feeling when I washed my face with this cleanser. It does feel like my skin is getting a deep cleansing, it was just too harsh for my skin. I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with sensitive skin, but for people with normal skin, I think they may really like the minty tingle of this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I tried this, this morning and can say without hesitation that it really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;I was in the shower for a couple of minutes as the water was getting hot and grabbed this bottled.  One of the toughest areas to really get clean is my back and face and neck areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you rub it in, it gives off a nice fragrance.  Within a minute or so, you start to feel that heat/ tingling sensation-- sort of like Vicks&#x27; Vapo-rub but without that harsh hospital-y smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It washed off quick and skin is very clean.  A bit on the dry side, but very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product. Easy to apply, easy to rinse off, and doesn&#x27;t dry me out. If you want to get a good scrub out of it you&#x27;ll need to use a cloth, because whatever beads are in this are few and far between, and apparently are for \\&quot;steam activation\\&quot; rather than exfoliation. Steam from the shower or bath is supposed to somehow interact with these beads to open your pores and clean them out. But I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this product&#x27;s ability to clean out my pores and, say, soap and water. Too many products promise \\&quot;pore cleaning power\\&quot; in one form or another, yet none deliver on it. So I&#x27;m not going to bother docking points for a benefit that everyone else says they have too, yet no one really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product contains menthol. Your face is going to feel funky during use and for a few minutes after, and I&#x27;m not sure what the benefit is. But again the product is decent, nothing terrible about it, yet nothing groundbreaking either.</li>
    <li> Steam automatically opens yours pores, Biore Activated Cleanser uses tiny beads to exfoliate your skin removing oil, dirt and makeup.  The steam&#x27;s heat triggers the tingly minty effect.  A little bit does go a long ways, so 5 ounces can last you a long time.  I have combination skin, and my skin felt very tight and overly dry after using this cleanser.  If you have sensitive like me, I definitely recommend using a good moisturizer afterwards or you may be left with dry itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I see incredible results and fewer blemishes...not really.  Did my pores seem cleaner...I guess so but I still see blackheads and dirt in many of my pores.  It performs just like another other exfoliating facial cleanser I have tried.  Hot shower opens your pores, cleanser cleans your face, step out of shower and pores close back up - your face is clean.  The only difference is that Biore is more affordable than most other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is an okay facial cleanser that is cheap and removes oils, dirt and makeup from your face easily with minimal results for blackhead removal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the mint that gives a nice tingly sensation in the steam - and gives the face a nice refreshed feeling.  It goes on thick with some microbeads to give a good cleansing.  I found it washes off fairly easily and my face has a nice zip and doesn&#x27;t feel dried out or leathery afterwards.  I like this a bit more than Olay and Simple, both of which I&#x27;ve been using lately, just for that mint.  In all, give it a try!</li>
    <li> Overall, this cleanser has a nice, fragrant scent, but it does have just a hint of a chemical scent. Just a hint. In any case, this cleanser lathers up well and cleanses well.  It rinses off quickly and cleanly, leaving my skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Steam Activated Cleanser by Biore is a good cleaner that works with the steam from your shower. I put the Biore cleanser on my face and washed it off right before the end of my shower and my skin felt so invigorated after I using the cleanser. The only issue that I had with this cleanser was that if you used too much of this cleanser it can cause your face to have a minty like feeling all day. I made the mistake of using too much and when I used my skin toner my face started feeling hot almost to the point that it stung a little, so after that I only use a small amount and haven&#x27;t had any problems since that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that my skin looks and feels great after I use it and I can tell the difference in the texture of my skin. My pores look better and the Steam Activated Cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I like that this cleanser cleans my face without drying it out and making my face look much more vibrant a plus for me.</li>
    <li> This is a nice and refreshing cleanser made by Biore.  To get a good lather, I would squeeze the cleanser onto the palm of your hands and then rub your hands together to create a lather, and then apply to face.  You don&#x27;t need a lot to create a nice lather.  It gets my face feeling nice and smooth, but takes a bit of water to get the lather off.  I would definely apply lotion after using it.  I have sensitive skin, and I have had no break outs while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as for the steam activation, I am not sure if that is a marketing ploy, or something that actually works.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my pores and I didn&#x27;t feel like there was enough steam in the shower to even help it.  I am not sure how much steam people build up in a normal daily shower, so I don&#x27;t think being steam activated is anything special.  If it was advertised as a normal cleanser, I would give it higher marks as it is nice and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a nice cleaner.  It doesn&#x27;t perform any steam tricks as advertised, but it does get your face nice and clean.  Would I buy this in the future?  Probably not.</li>
    <li> Very Chemical smell. You can feel it getting cold, which is nice, but I don&#x27;t feel like it cleans my skin better than other products. Plus, all of the chemical ingredients are kind of a put off for me. There&#x27;s nothing seriously wrong with it, but Ifelt like it was better for my skin to use something more natural.</li>
    <li> I take a daily brief hot shower.  I keep this cleanser in the shower and wash my face with it every morning.  My pores have never looked to tight and clean.  I have liked everything Biore has ever made and this is no exception.  I have rosacea and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I also am prone to little blackheads on my nose and an oily T-zone, and this keeps my pores looking flawless.  I rub it in with my fingers and it foams gently and rinses off cleanly, without leaving a film.  I will repurchase this.  It&#x27;s like a mini facial every morning.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have problem skin but I do like knowing and feeling that my face is clean. This product is easy to use and takes very little time, since you are already in the shower anyways. I only use a small dab, lather it up and scrub it into my face. It is a tingly, cool feeling on the skin and washes easily and cleanly away. Hours later my face still feels clean and soft. Definitely a product I&#x27;d use again!</li>
    <li> I like to use this in the shower. It helps to exfoliate, and cleanse my skin as well. It feels really wonderful and cooling, minty almost. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have a huge problem with oily skin. I have tried many cleansers throughout my life, both cheap and expensive. I have not found &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; and this is not it. As a cleanser, it works well. It definitely took care of the oily skin giving it a good wash. The amount required for it to work is very small, something that I appreciate. My face fell clean and I can definitely feel the difference. But, it also feels tight. The cleanser is a bit drying and, even after applying moisturizer, I still felt some tightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal skin, this MIT work for you. If you have dry or dry/oily skin, this might be a pass.</li>
    <li> Just had to try this cleanser after I read the description. Before I got a real life and was a carefree type freeloading off my folks i used to hang my head over a pot of steaming water infused with fresh mint. I&#x27;d do this faithfully every other day to keep blackheads and zits at bay. Those were the days.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that this is way less labor intensive, doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like a wilted flower, but has the same fresh cleansing scent of mint all while showering.&lt;br /&gt;All you need is hot steamy water and this cleanser. The end result is soft smooth skin that feels ultra clean and your senses are awake. If you want squeaky clean skin that feels great, try this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different cleansers over the years, and honestly, this was probably the worst one.  I have combination skin and am still acne-prone, but my skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It has a horrible medicated smell, as soon as you squeeze it into your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It tingles A LOT as soon as you rub it into your skin.  Some people like tingling cleansers I suppose, but this one was way too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It left my skin overly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it felt harsh, drying, and unnatural.  I&#x27;ve liked many of Biore&#x27;s products in the past, but this was certainly not one of them.  I don&#x27;t think this cleanser is for everyone.</li>
    <li> The first few times I used this cleanser, I thought it was nice.  It lathers nicely, smells good, and rinses away cleanly.  It leaves behind a cool, menthol feeling.  However, after a few days, it gave me huge, painful breakouts.  I haven&#x27;t broken out like that since I was a teen, MANY moons ago.  Yikes!  I know it says non-comedogenic, but for me it was NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended at all unless you never ever get a pimple.</li>
    <li> This is a nice invigorating facial cleanser with a minty smell.  It makes your skin tingle.  My skin feels pretty dry after using it though.  Might be good if you have oily skin or for a teen, but not good for my middle age skin.</li>
    <li> If your skin is really sensitive, this is not the Biore product for you.  It contains Menthol, which gives that cooling sensation when you wash and can irritate your skin.  If peppermint bothers you, this will too.&lt;br /&gt;Using this in the shower does make a difference in how it feels (or at least soaking your face with a hot washcloth) as compared to just using it as a regular cleanser.  I cannot say that I see a difference in how it actually cleans however.  It does leave your skin feeling fairly tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An upside is that it is \\&quot;male friendly\\&quot; as it does not smell flowery or look specifically like a product for girls.  If you have teenage boys you know that this can be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for those prone to acne,  pick something with salicylic acid  for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I have used several different facial cleansers (for both women and men) to clean my face while in the shower.  From Gillette Fusion to Nivea to Arbonne Exfoliating Wash (which is my absolute favorite but just way too expensive), I&#x27;ve tried many of them, and they all do about the same job, varying a bit with respect to personal preference on smell and texture.  Overall, this Biore product is as good as similarly priced products, but none are of the same quality as the Arbonne.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of something designed for use in the shower. This works really well. However, repeated use leaves my skin dry, which means lotion, which I don&#x27;t really like. So it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ll use every day, but just occasionally. Unfortunately, I think that kind of defeats the purpose of it. So, if you&#x27;re okay with rubbing lotion on your face every day, this will probably work well for you.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be technically correct, this cleanser is warm water activated, steam is 100 degrees Celsius, a lot hotter than the mist in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have that out of my system, the cleanser is actually pretty good. I find the scent pleasant, and it does as good a job as a cleanser as most shower gels. Ounce for ounce it may be a little more expensive than some shower gels, but I chalk that up to the brand name. Overall, it is a decent product and worth consideration as a skin cleanser. P-)</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason this product is recommended for use in the shower:  one just does not get the same cleansing experience via the sink.  But a good warm shower, with all that steam and total moisture, really seems to activate something in this cleanser that otherwise doesn&#x27;t happen.  The result is an incredible deep clean that I rarely experience with other cleansers, complete with a nice after-tingle on my skin.  My skin feels wonderful, and the cleaning effect is noticeable after a week of use--great improvement on skin.</li>
    <li> I really like using this. I use it in the shower where it is easy to get the steam action opening my pores and the easy wash off of the shower. It is thick enough to put a dab in the palm or your hand, lather it up a little and wash your face. It doesn&#x27;t take much product so this will last quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was surprising (and nice!) was the cool and tingly feeling if it on my face. It didn&#x27;t last long so it wasn&#x27;t annoying and it was refreshing and nicely scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin very clean and not dry - well no drier than using any other soap type product on my face. There were no uneven dry patches either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product!</li>
    <li> Okay ... I don&#x27;t believe the hype about the steam activation. It&#x27;s great marketing though, and if Biore was the first to come up with it, good for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the cleanser a lot. The fragrance was kind of herbal and clean-smelling without smelling of detergent. It did seem to do a great job of cleaning my skin. I used it on my face and body, and I liked how my skin felt after. A lot.</li>
    <li> I love many of Biore&#x27;s products and my daily face wash is from their line. I enjoy trying their different products and was excited to try the Steam Activated Cleanser. It lather ups really nice and it did leave a clean feeling on my face. The little beads in it dissolve as soon as you lather it up in the shower. The scent used in this facial cleanser smells good too. It had a minty fresh clean scent to it. Once I placed it on my face, my face had a tingly sensation as well. Sadly, after using it for a few consecutive days, it dried my skin out really bad, even when using moisturizer. My skin is more dry in the colder months so I&#x27;ll probably limit my use of it until the weather gets warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad cleanser. My face felt refreshed and clean after using it. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so drying to my skin.</li>
    <li> I am usually a fan Biore products, but I haven&#x27;t been impressed with the Steam Activated Cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t lather well. I expected to feel it being \\&quot;activated\\&quot; by the steam (maybe some tingling), but I didn&#x27;t feel anything. The  little beads in it do dissolve as soon as you use it. The sent is pleasant and not offensive. I don&#x27;t like the lid on the bottle because it is difficult to close with one hand and it gets full of water in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t actually seen any improvement/reduction of breakouts. Overall, I am neutral toward this cleanser and would not buy it again.</li>
