<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash! I have minor breakouts around my chin and this has stopped them!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Would recommend it to anyone with slightly oily skin. Maybe even normal/combination skin 2x/week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually love this entire line. The sunscreens are a little too thick for my taste, but everything else is wonderful! The lotion feels like silk!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser from 2008 and I just love it. I am black and my skin is combination. It used to only be available in MD offices with the price bumped up, so I am happy to see it here on Amazon at a more reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My face feels clean and tingly, never dry.  Great seller, great service. Thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like it have used other products by Epionce.  Smell takes a bit to get use to as it smells like NyQuil.  Cleans my face well and does not leave it feeling tight or dry like other products have.  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Best price on the internet. The product works very well for my oily skin. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and keeps breakouts from happening. Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Use this every night. It is soothing, cooling and works perfect on my sensitive skin without over drying.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that is able to control the ever appearing blemishes on my difficult combination skin. I have tried a number of products over the counter. After throwing caution to the wind, and going to see a dermatologist, I was given samples of this product line, and I immediately fell in love. The samples lasted about two weeks, during which time my skin healed tremendously and became smooth and bumpless, which I have never before seen. I recommend this product to anyone looking to drastically change the quality of their skin.</li>
    <li> This gel cleanser makes my skin feel and look terrific. I use it at night before I go to bed, followed by the Lite Lytic Lotion.</li>
    <li> Feels so amazing on your skin. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cleanser. Works great for my skin type. Service is awesome! Quick, fast and easy.</li>
    <li> great price with a timely deivery</li>
    <li> Just like the one at my dermatologist&#x27;s office but way cheaper! And leaves you with a really clean, gentle feeling :)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My skin has never felt and looked better. I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> my med spa used this product to clean my face, it had such a nice fragrance and my skin felt great afterwards, so I bought some.  I love the pump and this cleanser, my only complaint is my face has been breaking out recently.  I don&#x27;t think it is because of this cleanser, but going to switch to an acne face wash until the breakouts get better.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! I love the whole Epionce line!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for 4 years and goodbye breakouts and pesky enlarged pores on my nose. Wish it were a bit less expensive. My dermatologist recommended it for hormonal acne. It works much better than anything else I have found. It really is for skin that is combination, oily or hormonal. I find that I need to switch off in the Winter when the air is very dry and I need more moisture.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser and great price.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that my wife re-orders this stuff like it was a magic elixir.  She says it is the best and it should be for what it cost.  She tells me that if I want her to stay as beautiful as she is, I had better keep ordering the Epionce Lytic Gel Cleanser.......so I do.  Why?&lt;br /&gt;Cause my mama didn&#x27;t raise no dummies!!</li>
    <li> My face feels so clean and not dry after using.</li>
    <li> I got this face wash about a year ago from my derm and it has been my favorite. Controls my acne and doesn&#x27;t strip the oil from my skin. I love this stuff and will always have it in my bathroom. :)</li>
    <li> I continue to be pleased with the product as to how it reduces fine lines and softens skin.  The specialist at my dermatologist was most helpful by recommending this for my skin.  Cannot go wrong with it.  Use twice a day as recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a great face cleanser... I love the way it leaves my face refreshed after washing.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser.  It&#x27;s gentle, slightly foamy, smells like lemongrass and effective.  Used it for the last year and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> All of the epionce products rock! I love this face wash paired with the lytic sport gel. Perfect for clearing bad acne!</li>
    <li> Loves this cleanser, just bought a backup. I do wish they would remove the camphor though… it burns my eyes!</li>
    <li> Face feels fresh and exceptionally clean. I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, but have noticed a difference in my face texture. Beautifum!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE his whole skin care line. Originally saw it in a local spa and then again in a dermatologists office. It&#x27;s a little pricey compared to some skin care products but I have very oily skin and most either made my face dry as a desert or doesn&#x27;t work at all. And I work as a medical professional where I&#x27;m required to wear a surgical face mask all day....which makes breakouts worse. Used twice a day along with the lotion and my skin just glows. No more need to see the dermatologist and was able to stop medication for my breakouts. i do wish that they had travel size packs that would fit in my carry on better. But that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
    <li> I love this face cleaner, it leaves my skin soft and not too dry. I enjoy the cool sensation it gives after I&#x27;ve used it. I also use the lytic plus tx lotion. My face is clearer, and smoother than it has been for a long time. I still break out occasionally but this helps my skin recover faster.</li>
