      <li>Thanks Bare Minerals for your continued wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I asked the lady at the store if they changed something in it, but she said it was the same great ingredients that had always been used in their makeup.</li>
      <li>My skin feels fantastic</li>
      <li>I have oily skin which is why I ordered the matte in the first place, but the original formula did a pretty good job too.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the matte and got the original, which was obviously the sellers fault, but this stuff is a great product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used bare minerals fairly medium in the original but decided to give the matte a try.</li>
      <li>I wear both matte and the original one.</li>
      <li>Super natural, nicely matt, great color, long lasting and great on your skin.</li>
      <li>if you have particular areas you need more coverage for.</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery !</li>
      <li>It is absolutely natural looking, I love it and</li>
      <li>I researched high and low to find out why this time the same product burned my face after I had been using for a year with flawless coverage and no burning.</li>
      <li>I love Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
      <li>I LOVE bare minerals</li>
      <li>I love this powder and the Bare Minerals website says they don&#x27;t use any animals for testing.</li>
      <li>I love Bare Minerals.</li>
      <li>Wear in conjunction with other products and have a beautiful face for the entire day.</li>
      <li>I was amazed to find that the coverage was actually a little better and more natural looking than the liquid foundation.  </li>
      <li>usually buy the original but hope to enjoy the Matte!</li>
      <li>I got some from a different brand and it worked just fine.  </li>
      <li>the soon as I used it I could tell that it was not the real thing</li>
      <li>I think that if you use this product, you absolutely need to get the primer.  </li>
      <li>This was off on color and it was like a normal powder, NOTHING like real bareMinerals foundation!</li>
      <li>Thanks for having on here.</li>
      <li>Its a different look than the original</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the same as the one you&#x27;d pay full price for at the store.  </li>
      <li>And even at the end of the day my face felt dry and smooth, not sticky/oily.  </li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
      <li>One major difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that the matte seems to make my face feel a bit more oily than the original which is strange since other reviewers said it controlled oil.</li>
      <li>The color match is exactly the same.</li>
      <li>I love Bare Minerals, I have been using Bare Minerals for years and typically go to Macy&#x27;s or Ulta to pick up my product.</li>
      <li>Even the texture on my face felt to different than the real stuff.</li>
      <li>I bought the Bare Minerals foundation powder in medium, the Mineral veil powder as a finishing powder, and a cheaper brand of primer (Bare Escentuals primer), plus a new set of brushes.  </li>
      <li>I will always order my bare minerals on line!</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is most definitely a learning curve for mineral powder makeup, but after three or four tries I had it down.</li>
      <li>I went home to desperately find out what the issue was, and turned out my original container that was so wonderful, was actually the fake version.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing Bare Minerals for a couple of years.  </li>
      <li>I only recently started using bare minerals and I will never use anything else!</li>

<li> The only problem I had with it is that after a few hours (because I have oily skin)</li>
<li> So I thought I&#x27;d try Bare minerals, but was skeptical because other powder foundations either made my face look dry and flaky or didn&#x27;t provide any coverage.  </li>

<li> a little mineral veil can&#x27;t fix though.</li>
<li> I had unknowingly been given the fake bare minerals and had been using it for a year with no problems.</li>
<li> I now use my regular liquid/cream makeup to touch up really bad, bad spots on my face and this makeup to cover all the rest.  </li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> so you can go casual or dressy.  </li>
<li> I was extremely disappointed in this product I received it and</li>

    <li> This is the best makeup that I have ever used.  I now use my regular liquid/cream makeup to touch up really bad, bad spots on my face and this makeup to cover all the rest.  It is absolutely natural looking, I love it and and I have had a lot of compliments since I started using this makeup!</li>
    <li> This was off on color and it was like a normal powder, NOTHING like real bareMinerals foundation! It smelled like perfumed powder and not in a good way! Ive been using bareMinerals for many years now and immediately noticed there was something off with the product!</li>
    <li> I wear both matte and the original one. This really does give you a perfect matte finish!  The only problem I had with it is that after a few hours (because I have oily skin) the matte finish starts to fade.  Its a different look than the original and you don&#x27;t look as dewy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I have been wearing Bare Minerals for a couple of years.  People regularly compliment me on my skin.  Wear in conjunction with other products and have a beautiful face for the entire day.</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals, I have been using Bare Minerals for years and typically go to Macy&#x27;s or Ulta to pick up my product. I was happy to be able to order this product and have it shipped right to my door using Amazon Prime. Thanks Bare Minerals for your continued wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Thanks for having on here. Can&#x27;t get yo mall so it&#x27;s nice to be able to order here. Love the matte. My 40+ skin looks amazing!!</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals foundation. It is good for my skin and covers well.</li>
    <li> Love the foundation, easy tomuse, lasts all day..loved the blurred finish it provides.</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and being able to order it online makes my life more simple.  This product covers well, has a very light feel, and I never have to worry about touch ups.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used everything from the cover girl powder to a Sephora loose powder and I went into Sephora to buy their brand again but it was discontinued. They recommended me to this and I bought it and I love it. It blends in nicely and isn&#x27;t chalky. I ran out after a year or so and bought it on here because it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed in this product I received it and the soon as I used it I could tell that it was not the real thing and I did some research and this is not real bareMinerals. Even the texture on my face felt to different than the real stuff.</li>
    <li> I ordered the matte and got the original, which was obviously the sellers fault, but this stuff is a great product.  I have oily skin which is why I ordered the matte in the first place, but the original formula did a pretty good job too.  It covers amazingly well, I wear it all day without breaking out and it layers really nicely so you can go casual or dressy.  This stuff is amazing. (If your oily, get the matte)</li>
    <li> Great product. Same as sephora. Would buy again with a doubt.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only makeup I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause or worsen any breakouts. Shipping was ahead of schedule. Will order from here again!</li>
    <li> Super natural, nicely matt, great color, long lasting and great on your skin. I HIGHLY recommend this product. My skin feels fantastic</li>
    <li> I love this powder and the Bare Minerals website says they don&#x27;t use any animals for testing.</li>
    <li> Great foundation.  I have oily skin in my T-zone and this stays put most of the day!  Love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same as the one you&#x27;d pay full price for at the store.  I love this makeup because it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing a bunch of makeup.  Helps keep me not shiny and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery ! I will always order my bare minerals on line! There even appears to be more in the container! I am hooked!&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy the original but hope to enjoy the Matte!</li>
    <li> This product was a little too drying for my skin, since I live in AZ &amp; it&#x27;s very dry here.  I sent it to my daughter in PA to use because it was her shade also &amp; it&#x27;s humid there.</li>
    <li> I had unknowingly been given the fake bare minerals and had been using it for a year with no problems. when I ran out I purchased this one at an actual bare minerals store, however was extremely disappointed after the authentic burned the heck out of my face, and stung so bad I had to hurry to a restroom to wash it off.

I went home to desperately find out what the issue was, and turned out my original container that was so wonderful, was actually the fake version. Sorry but it&#x27;s the truth in my case...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used bare minerals fairly medium in the original but decided to give the matte a try. The color match is exactly the same. I like how the matte gives an almost airbrush finish where as the original is more brighter so to say. I alternate depending on my mood. One major difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that the matte seems to make my face feel a bit more oily than the original which is strange since other reviewers said it controlled oil. It&#x27;s nothing a little mineral veil can&#x27;t fix though.</li>
    <li> love it best foundation i have ever owned</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing liquid foundation for years, and even though I buy the oil-free kind from Clinique and Lancome, it still feels sticky to me.  So I thought I&#x27;d try Bare minerals, but was skeptical because other powder foundations either made my face look dry and flaky or didn&#x27;t provide any coverage.

I was amazed to find that the coverage was actually a little better and more natural looking than the liquid foundation.  And even at the end of the day my face felt dry and smooth, not sticky/oily.  It even did a good job of covering my freckles/sunspots. I think that if you use this product, you absolutely need to get the primer.  I got some from a different brand and it worked just fine.  A little bit goes a long way - you only need maybe just a pea size amount.  It helps the powder stick evenly.  I would recommend getting the concealer brush too if you have particular areas you need more coverage for.</li>
    <li> Nice stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t go on quite as opaque-ly as some other minerals I have (hand mixed by my esthetician.)  But it is very very nice in many ways.</li>
    <li> I LOVE bare minerals, it&#x27;s the only make up I will use and I have been using it for years. I put it on once and don&#x27;t ever need to reapply it. I usually buy this make up at sephora or Ulta, but this product is exactly the same for a few dollars cheaper, so I&#x27;ll be ordering it from amazon from now on.</li>
    <li> I only recently started using bare minerals and I will never use anything else! This keeps me matte and fully covered all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is most definitely a learning curve for mineral powder makeup, but after three or four tries I had it down.</li>
