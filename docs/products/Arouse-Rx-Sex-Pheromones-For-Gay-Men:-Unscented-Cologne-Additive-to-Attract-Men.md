      <li>You better believe I plan to win this EVERY month.</li>
      <li>knew there is a mix review about this product, but it works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Really potent, can&#x27;t get rid of guys!</li>
      <li>I was really popular with customers, way more than my co-workers.</li>
      <li>i think when i sweat it releases the pheromones more too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gay</li>
      <li>For gay men to attract men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really can&#x27;t say yet for I have not noticed anything different, sooooo lets give it more time!!!!</li>
      <li>Take a hot shower, wear some nice cologne and smile.</li>
      <li>having lots of fun at the gym these days!</li>
      <li>After that it&#x27;s easy to figure out which ones are \\&quot;curious\\&quot; ;-)</li>
      <li>It comes in many different scents (Aqua Di Gio is my favorite).</li>

      <li>Although, I don&#x27;t exactly use it as directed.</li>
      <li>Very simple way of attracting more attention.</li>

    <li> This item does not work.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money.  If anything, this item is a placebo.  Now something that I have found to work is the phermone cologne (it comes in bottles that looks like a male torso.).  It comes in many different scents (Aqua Di Gio is my favorite).</li>
    <li> Guys, what are you waiting for??!?! GET THIS STUFF!!!! I never leave the house with out putting some one. I especially like to use it before I hit them gym. It&#x27;s not oily or smelly so I can drop some on and no one knows. Working out REALLY intensifies this stuff and I always have plenty of guys paying attention to me.</li>
    <li> Really can&#x27;t say yet for I have not noticed anything different, sooooo lets give it more time!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m gay and I usually have no problem getting some action, but I get tired with the usual haunts, so I mix some pheromones with my cologne and hit the straight clubs. I have no problem getting guys to talk to me. After that it&#x27;s easy to figure out which ones are \\&quot;curious\\&quot; ;-)</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money and time!</li>
    <li> I work in sales at a high end men&#x27;s shop so it&#x27;s all about closing the deal if we want our commission. I noticed that after I started using these pheromones I was really popular with customers, way more than my co-workers. This is my second month as the top earner at work. You better believe I plan to win this EVERY month.</li>
    <li> It does not seem to work for me.  I smelled oily when I apply, that is. I felt conned about this product.</li>
    <li> well I bough this cause I tough it will help but I think was a bad choice I have only a few drops left and it did not said anything about what is it said it will do...</li>
    <li> It works great for me. Although, I don&#x27;t exactly use it as directed. I pour it on the floor of the health club locker room, when attractive men slip and fall, I abduct them and take them home with me. Please don&#x27;t tell anyone!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t say any comments in this product. I give it to a friend because I do not find any use.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s only a small botter of oil, no any help!!! I just wasted money on it.  please never ever buy it!!!</li>
    <li> i totally wear this in the gym too before lifting weights.  i think when i sweat it releases the pheromones more too.  having lots of fun at the gym these days!</li>
    <li> The first pheromone I use was just a standard ClimaXfactor for men.&lt;br /&gt;I knew there is a mix review about this product, but it works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Really potent, can&#x27;t get rid of guys!</li>
    <li> Bought some for a friend of mine who never seems to close the deal, and we found him a Friday night friend within 45 minutes of being at the club.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be taken in! It&#x27;s all placebo. Take a hot shower, wear some nice cologne and smile. There&#x27;s nothing this can do for you.</li>
    <li> several nights i&#x27;ve worn this out to my regular friday night spot, and guys who i&#x27;ve know for years are suddenly flirting with me.  I still wear my same aftershave, just mix the pheromones in first.  Very simple way of attracting more attention.</li>
    <li> what it does for me is give me a little more confidence to put myself out there, and when i do i have a higher success rate.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything so I&#x27;m not even conscious of wearing it, and it mixes well with my cologne.</li>
    <li> This item is being marketed under three different claims:&lt;br /&gt;1. For men to attract women&lt;br /&gt;2. For women to attract men.&lt;br /&gt;3. For gay men to attract men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read the contents claim for this product you will&lt;br /&gt;find that each one contains the exact same phermones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can&#x27;t be all things to all people. I just by mistake ordered this&lt;br /&gt;product a 2nd time based on the product title in the listing.&lt;br /&gt;To me this seems deceptive...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning my recent order when it arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t fall for this BS.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s works</li>
