      <li>versatile and fast drying opi is the best but fyi the new opi bottles that are nicole are not as good.</li>

      <li>Had to use another top coat on top of this.</li>
      <li>Looks great, dries fast.</li>
      <li>As a top coat it chipped after ~2-3 days, but much better hold up than without it.</li>
      <li>Contains no formaldehyde so better for nails.</li>
      <li>While I like OPI nail polish, this isn&#x27;t my favorite product of theirs.</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for ?  </li>
      <li>So glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>I used to use a Sally Hanson acrylic topcoat but found this to be much better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really the best top/base coat I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> bubbles!!! bubbles everywhere!</li>
    <li> Looks great, dries fast.</li>
    <li> This start-to-finish polish is great! It works well as a top coat and a base coat, and my only complaint is that I used it up too quickly, since it was doing double duty. Item arrived promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> For the price I expected better results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this polish.  It was kind of thick, but worst of all it took FOREVER to dry.  I used it as a base coat and a top coat.  Just too many coats of things and it all got too thick.</li>
    <li> Before I used this, my fingernail polish would start chipping almost the next day.  I have noticed that it has strengthened my nails.  it hasn&#x27;t made a huge difference but it does help quite a bit.    I really recommend this product.  It is worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this every week! Dries fast and my nails are stronger.</li>
    <li> I used this as a base coat and top coat.  my nail polish has not chipped; however, my nails don&#x27;t feel too much stronger.  I&#x27;ve only used one time, though.</li>
    <li> I generally like all OPI products. This one is pretty good, since you can use it for three purposes at the same time.</li>
    <li> My nail technician trains others in OPI products and uses them exclusively on my nails.  I normally get a french manicure (gel) on my nails with OPI products once every 4 or 5 weeks.  Just recently I started painting my own nails in between my manicures and have been getting amazing results with the Start-to-Finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it as a base coat assures that the color doesn&#x27;t bleed into the edges of my manicure (for when I want to go back to just the white tips) and also helps the color adhere well.  My technician did tell me that this base coat does adhere better to gel nails than bare ones, if that helps.  She also highly recommended that I do just three swipes (center, and each edge) with each coat.  Over-painting with each coat can cause some of the problems people have with chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I have my nails painted, top coated, and completely dry, I can get at least a week without chipping.  I even went on a camping/backpacking adventure and did not end up with a single chip.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and it dries fast</li>
    <li> Makes my nail polish last longer</li>
    <li> Shiny great product versatile and fast drying opi is the best but fyi the new opi bottles that are nicole are not as good.</li>
    <li> I use the Base Coat under my polish to give the nail polish a smoother look.  I use the Base Coat over the nail polish as I think it helps to lessen the nail polish from being so easily chipped.  If you only want a clear polish, this can be used for a good clear polish too.  The best thing about it is being formaldehyde free.</li>
    <li> Does not work a base coat, at least for me. I tried it as a base coat only, as both base and top coat, as a base coat with a different top coat. All times my polish started chipping the next day! When used as a top coat (with no base coat), my polish chipped in 4 days, which is about normal for me with other top coats. Still searching for something that works for me.</li>
    <li> this is a great opi product - works wonders on my nails. i put a base coat, 2 coats of any opi polish and then the top coat...stays on for 2 weeks...highly recommend!</li>
    <li> If you didn&#x27;t study Geology and you don&#x27;t know what &amp;#34;cleavage fracture&amp;#34; is, look up Micah. This stuff took off the top layer of my nails pretty far down almost to the quick. It doesn&#x27;t last and doesn&#x27;t effect the quality of the nail polish.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was formaldehyde free and that is a plus. I can save and have one less bottle because this works as base and top coat.</li>
    <li> Peels quickly and is not very shiny.  It doesn&#x27;t seem as good as normal OPI products.</li>
    <li> I did my toenails with this top and base coat 3 weeks ago and they still haven&#x27;t chipped! That a record for me. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> Great product would recommend because it helps to keep your nail polish from chipping and guards against nail breakage for longer time.</li>
    <li> I love this OPI object works perfectly fine smooth and packed well nice cute box</li>
    <li> LOVE OPI.  and all their products.  This one leaves shine on top and is a great base coat too. Will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping. Love OPI products go on smooth and dry fast.</li>
    <li> Its ok, not a very high gloss but it does the job.</li>
    <li> A little expense but a great product.</li>
    <li> Helps to keep my polish on longer. No peeling. Great Deliver and service.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t personally think this does what it says.. The Sephore  star to finish just doesn&#x27;t start so it definitely doesn&#x27;t finish.. Went back to my Perfect Formula base coat and PF  top coat  SORRY  SEPHORA  I love OPI but Not you</li>
    <li> Read the reviews on this product-thought I would try. I&#x27;m not having the same results as everyone else. My nails are still spliting. I have no idea what to try next. Company shipped fast-thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this opi product. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This is the only top and base product i will use, i couldn&#x27;t find in stores, so i ordered on line, it&#x27;s worth the wait! My nails stay strong and do not break or chip using this product!Also, amazon was the best price out there.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product. Dries fast great coverage. Nice to have an all in one base coat and top coat.</li>
    <li> Great base coat, my nail polish lasts much longer than if I wear it with no base coat. This product also dries very quickly. Only downside is it tends to flake off if worn alone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I have used this for years. Makes your polish last for months. I swear!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product since I dont have to buy a separate base and top coat! does a great job to prevent chipping.</li>
    <li> This does the trick for creating a good manicure.</li>
    <li> It has made my nails stronger.  The shine on my nails is very nice.  Happy with this product. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week but already my nails are better. So glad I found this.</li>
    <li> This is a great bottom/top coat. Gives your polish a longer life and help from those dark colored stains when you remove it.</li>
    <li> Love that it is formaldehyde (if that is how you spell it) free! Don&#x27;t do my nails very often so this combo of a base and top coat was a perfect solution. It dries pretty quickly as soon it is put on and have not had a chip in it after a week. I usually keep my nails short since I cook and clean regularly and it still looks great. My only note would be to clean off the bottle for dried particles on your next application.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Highly recommend it especially for problem nails. Extends the life of the polish and helps the nails to grow. So glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> A great product that is difficult to find in my area.  This coating dries quickly and flows on easily.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Use as base coat and top coat. No need to buy two products. It works very well.</li>
    <li> Very good quality product, thick and dies the job. Long lasting bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  My nails are usually soft, and I&#x27;m pretty tough on my hands so they break a lot.  My nails are longer right now than they&#x27;ve been in years.  I&#x27;ve been using the start-to-finish product for about a month and I&#x27;m quite pleased.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is that it does tend to peel if you don&#x27;t keep up with it.  The instructions say to start with 2 coats, and then another coat every other day for 7 days, remove and repeat.  I notice if i miss a coat it will start to chip and peel a bit, but that hasn&#x27;t kept it from working.  I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> If you use OPI polish you definitely need this one coat does all from start to finish, I mean how else will you keep your manicure going.  Needed it!  Worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like this 3 in 1 polish. It&#x27;s not very thick so I would suggest a more shiney &amp; thicker top coat, but it does make the polish last longer. I will definitely buy this again! The price I felt was worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Not the same as salon</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful! My polished nails last for weeks with no chipping. I finally had to remove it myself to put on some new color. This dries quite quickly and looks professional</li>
    <li> I use this product when I just want my nails to be clear, and I will layer on 3 coats.  It dries very quickly and works extremely well as a nail strengthener, as I can definitely tell the difference in my nails.  However, it chips off ridiculously easily, which is frustrating.  Maybe if I had time to layer on another coat every 1-2 days it&#x27;d be okay but otherwise it&#x27;s not worth just using it by itself.  As a base or top coat, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 times; but still on the fence as to whether or not I like it.  My polish seems to last longer if I don&#x27;t use this as a base.</li>
    <li> It is convenient to have both base coat and top coat in only one bottle, which saves some space especially when traveling. However, I noticed that when I apply this product as top coat, the nail polish color does transfer to the brush of this product.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this! I take it to nail salon and use as base &amp; top coat. My pedicures last a long time with no chipping and stays shiny!</li>
    <li> This was a better price then retail stores and upheld the OPI standards, made my polish last longer~</li>
    <li> I have tried other products in attempt to save money.  They simply don&#x27; work as well.  This is a great multi-tasker and will help your mani dry fater as well as keep your polish shiny and looking good.  It is much more tough and seem to prevent chipping better than the cheaper stuff I have tried.  This is well worth the extra money spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff!! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> So far I have only used it a couple of times.  It works like it is supposed to work I guess.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had clear nail polishes before that always are too thick or too thin. This is just perfect for a base coat and a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;It has a large brush to I only really need to sweep across my nails once and it gets the whole nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice though that I had to do 3 coats across my KB Shimmer Oh Splat! because it has large sparkles in it.&lt;br /&gt;But aside from that I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this 3-in-1 OPI product for natural nails and would definitely recommend it for ease of use. I discarded my off-brand top coat and nail strengtheners after using it the first time. Great product.</li>
    <li> Does not chip easily and does not yellow so my nails stay fresh looking. Love this Base Coat, Top Coat and Strengthener!</li>
    <li> This stuff is my all time favorite nail polish ever!  It dries quickly,  it looks nice and it is an all in one! I have not been able to find it in any stores and this stuff really is the best!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my friend for part of her Christmas gift.  She tells me it is great.  Going to purchase some for myself tomorrow when I go shopping in the city.</li>
    <li> The polish coat itself worked nicely--I loved the shine it gave to my nails (no color) which made them look neat without the extra effort of applying a color. However, the product arrived with a damaged brush (bristles sticking out, which makes it difficult to paint an even coat) and on my SECOND time to use it, I went to uncap the polish and the brush disconnected from the black top. I may be able to glue it back together, but not without some serious mess. For something I spent over $11 for (inc. tax), I really would expect a higher quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that I&#x27;m unable to return to Amazon, because &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.&amp;#34; So for $11.23 I got one coat of nail polish. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, OPI has been disappointing me more and more lately--my last color came with a damaged brush as well. I&#x27;ll be looking for a new brand.</li>
    <li> The top coat is everything a top coast is expected to be.  It dries pretty quickly and with a shine that lasts.  The base coat, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t create the smooth foundation that other base coats do.</li>
    <li> I love all OPI Products and I am in love with this top and base coat as it is all in one and is Formaldehyde Free Formula as well as a nail Strengthener!  This is good for those who does not like that really nasty nail smell you get from some nail polishes and so on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually remember going to a trade show and they had a booth set up with all their products when they were just starting out!  I loved their products then and still love them now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone out there as well as all my family and friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can think of anything else to add, I will do so at a later time!</li>
    <li> Works great and lasts a long time.  The only issue is that when you use it as a top coat, it&#x27;s not shiny enough.  Had to use another top coat on top of this.</li>
    <li> This is handy to use and saves multiple bottles, however I did not notice a great deal of staying power with my polish. It dries quickly and makes a quick repolish a much quicker job to do. I have always found OPI to be a way better brand than some of the cheaper polishes.</li>
    <li> OPI is a very good polish. Lots of options for giving yourself a good manicure!</li>
    <li> Great base and topcoat in one.  It&#x27;s perfect for all types of polish. I&#x27;ve used it on gel and standard polish.  It&#x27;s long lasting and looks great. And it&#x27;s strengthened my nails.</li>
    <li> This is the first OPI product that has not worked at all for me.  Every time I apply this to my nails, it has dried with bubbles in it.  Mind you, I did give a fair trial, removing it and re-applying this five times.  It gets a No Star rating from me - caution, it can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
    <li> Nice to have a versatile product that does it all (base coat &amp; top coat), &amp; it&#x27;s from a company that I trust to sell quality products (OPI).</li>
    <li> This nail polish is not shiny and it drys sticky. Worst OPI etter yet wort nail polish ever. I think $1.00 Wet n Wild may be better!!! You guys should stop selling it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this product. At first it seemed great- it went on super smooth and didn&#x27;t mess up the color of my polish at all, even though my polish had some shimmer to it!&lt;br /&gt;But even though I painted to the edge, this stuff still peeled really badly after only 2 days. Actually, it took some of my nail with it when it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Maybe I can use it on runs in stockings?</li>
    <li> This works well as a base and top coat. My nails didn&#x27;t get stained by the color polish I used over it and as a top coat, it dried very quickly. I think it protected my finished nails.</li>
    <li> OPI is a good nail product which I purchased often.  Not a whole lot that you can say about it.  It goes on smoothly.  Wears well.  Lasts a little longer that some other products.</li>
    <li> I like the ingredients and use it as a base and top coat.  Applies smoothly.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding both a base coat and a top coat! I need to keep my nail tech happy!  OPI are good products!</li>
    <li> Leaves bubbles behind on my nail polish so that I have to start all over again from the beginning. Yes I waited till my nails were 100% dry before adding the coat. Also after using it twice the brush part broke off the lid.</li>
    <li> I used to use a Sally Hanson acrylic topcoat but found this to be much better. My nails stayed nice for about a week (difficult task with two young children!). Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I like how this dries fast and glides easily over nail polish or dries fast as base coat. Its great to use just one product that does the job.</li>
    <li> fantastic for splitting nails!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find this helpful to put as a top coat (experienced same chipping as I did without), but I LOVE this as an undercoat... instead of big chips after a day or two (or less), it only chips in little tiny pieces, and at the ends of my nails (where they come into contact with a lot of sufaces).  I can usually keep wearing my nailpoish for 3-5 days, instead of 1-2 days...</li>
    <li> I just love this polish! I always wear clear polish &amp; it normally lasts about 5-6 days &amp; then starts to peel &amp; chip. This polish lasts about 2 weeks before I ever have to do my nails again. Definately worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is the best ever! I love that it&#x27;s an all in one and it dries quickly! Really helps my polish last longer and doesn&#x27;t strip my nails.</li>
    <li> Another great nail product by OPI! Love the fact that you have base &amp; top coat in one - especially great for traveling.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t produce as shiny a top coat as I like to see, therefore I withheld one star.  I cannot comment on the long term benefit of the nail strengthening portion since I haven&#x27;t used it that long.  It seemed to perform pretty well as a base coat since the polish glided over it OK.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Really helps strengthens nails. Great top and bottom coat. I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> Works well as a base and top coat. Use it with OPI and other brands of nail polishes. Happy with my purchase and product.</li>
    <li> OPI is always excellent for me. The product is helping my nails after trying shelack treatment on my nails with the results of my nails being soft.</li>
    <li> Dries reasonably fast and stays for a long time</li>
    <li> I used this and my nail polish peeled off in one coat! Not worth the $14 I spent on it. Went straight in the trash.</li>
    <li> As a top coat I was shocked that my nails started chipping just after 2-3 days, even when tested with different polish brands.  This is not a good top coat which is why I give it only three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However!  I followed the enclosed instructions to do their 7 day strengthening method of reapplying as a base coat only.  My nails are as hard as hoofs!  I am so amazed because they are usually bendy and brittle pieces of paper.  Granted I started taking prenatal vitamins so I can&#x27;t attribute this new found toughness to just OPI, although I can tell you it made a significant difference.</li>
    <li> I got the nail polish 2 days before the estimated delivery I love it! It leaves my nails shiny and dries very quickly, it&#x27;s bigger than I thought it would be and that is definitely a plus! Will definitely buy from them again!</li>
    <li> I have a hard time keeping polish on my fingernails. I have tried several different types of base and top coats and thought since this one is an OPI it would be great. I have used it a couple different times with different brands of polish and the polish chips off much faster than the others.</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed in this base/top coat.  It is rather average, less than I would expect from OPI.  Works well enough as a basecoat, giving polish a slightly longer wear than if it were solo.  It isn&#x27;t my favorite as a top coat, chips easily and doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as others.  I was hoping I could slim down the manicure kit with this one product to replace two- unfortunately that isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
    <li> Love this! It does make my nail stronger and as a top coat it keeps the polish from chipping. I used it as a top coat and the polish lasted almost a week and that is with doing dishes, typing all day and stripping floors. I was running out of time when I redid my nails in a diffrent color and within 2 days my nails were chipped and needed to be redone. I have only used OPI nail polish with this item.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing when you first try but after repeat use you will find your nails aren&#x27;t growing stronger and in fact start peeling and breaking off.  My mother also noticed this and so have a few friends to whom I have recommended this product. They also agree.  Either it&#x27;s chemically formulated somehow to hook you in the first go round or they just don&#x27;t batch each one correctly.  I bought this 3 times so who knows.  Sneaky marketing tactic OPI.  I&#x27;m a sucker no longer.  Going back to my other brand that worked consistently.</li>
    <li> Opi has done it again !!  You get a base clear coat, top clear coat, along with a nail strengthener all in one product. What more could you ask for ?  It does a great job. Love it !</li>
    <li> I paint my nails a lot because they&#x27;re weak and it&#x27;s the only way to keep them from breaking, so I have this product on my nails nearly constantly. Where it really shines is as a base coat. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t turn the nail yellow or leave it brittle. However, I use Sally Hansen Professionals as my top coat--I think it works better than the OPI for that purpose. But as far as base coats are concerned, this is absolutely awesome.</li>
    <li> Holy cow.  This is great stuff.  I keep my nails short, but they&#x27;re still pretty brittle and they&#x27;re always splitting so I really bought this more for the nail strengthening purpose.  I used it first on clean, &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; nails.  It really gave my tips a polished look and my nails actually do seem like they&#x27;re in better shape since using this.  I&#x27;ve also used it as a top coat and it&#x27;s amazing for that purpose as well.  I&#x27;m notoriously hard on my nail polish, usually chipping it the next day.  I topped off some Essie polish (great colors, but it can be pretty chippy) with this and only just saw some wear after 7 days and that was at the cuticle where it start &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; rather than chipping.</li>
    <li> t&#x27;s very good to use as base or top caoat or dry fast coat. it makes loly 30 sec to dry yr nail after coat, so amazing. really love it. you won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> This product helps me with being proactive with my daily nail care concerns.  Healthy nails are now right &amp;#34;at my finger tips&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is great having one product to use for both the top coat and the base coat.  The product goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> OMG this is a must have. Period. don&#x27;t think twice!</li>
    <li> Dries nicely.  Not too thick so can use as a nice base and top coat.  Helps nail polish last longer without chipping.</li>
    <li> Had a problem with my nails chipping and breaking until I started using this product. They had taken some real hits recently that I am sure would normally have resulted in chips and breaks but they held up GREAT! LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I love it and it really works. It&#x27;s a start to finish base coat and top coat all in one</li>
    <li> This polish has helped make my manicures last longer even in gardening season. My nails aren&#x27;t breaking as much as well.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I use this all the time its really great to have a top coat and bottom coat in one beacuse its saves you buying two and saevs you money!</li>
    <li> after about a week of use i could see a big difference in the strength of my nails -they were always soft and weak until using this</li>
    <li> This is a great base coat. As a top coat it chipped after ~2-3 days, but much better hold up than without it. It goes on smooth and dries smooth.</li>
    <li> As always, OPI its the best, worth every penny. You get what you pay for. Its a base coat and a top coat, its a combo</li>
    <li> Since I have discovered this product it is the only top coat/base coat that I care to use.  Love it</li>
    <li> Used now very GOOD last long time,strong protection+no formaldehyde best feature,4health. PRIOR said Haven&#x27;t used yet but like o.p.i.products m.L.</li>
    <li> Sets up quickly and lasts much longer than previous kind my fiance had.</li>
    <li> My favorite --- it dries very quickly and I don&#x27;t get smudges later.  It has also strengthened my nails. I will definitely be buying it again and tossing all of the other base coats and top coats I have.</li>
    <li> Easy application, quick drying. However, it&#x27;s very thin, (thus the quick dry, I&#x27;m sure), even with four coats. It is not nearly as durable as the regular OPI top coat. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> WOW!  No formaldehyde AND no acetone.</li>
    <li> Did not protect nails at all.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff so much</li>
    <li> After years of gel, I have given my nails a break.  They weren&#x27;t very strong at first.  After a couple weeks of using this my nails have grown stronger and longer; they look great!</li>
    <li> Love the formula without formaldahyd, I think it&#x27;s better for your nails.</li>
    <li> makes my nails brittle</li>
    <li> Still waiting to see how this performs on my nails.</li>
    <li> Awesome best all in one</li>
    <li> This compound polish works great!</li>
    <li> I am a woman of simple steps so having one product that does 3 things is perfect for me.  I use this as base and top coat and it goes on smoothly and dries fast.  OPI is my favorite brand of nail products.</li>
    <li> Opi is a good  for the nails, it sells itself, I got fast delervery , A+</li>
    <li> While I like OPI nail polish, this isn&#x27;t my favorite product of theirs. Normally OPI is a good lasting nail polosh, so I assumed theor base coat, plus strengthener, and top coat all in one would be just as good. As a base coat, I hate it, it doesn&#x27;t help seal the nail and lend to keeping the nail polish on any longer, and as a top coat it&#x27;s okay. It leaves much to be desired, but it got 3 stars because it&#x27;s a great strengthener. Just follow the directions of reapply every two days and after seven remove and reapply. It lasts great, makes my nails look shiney, and keeps them sealed. Funny how is fails when you add another polish. But overall I would by it again just because of the strengthener part.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this. I wanted it to do everything it said it would. It just didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I would paint them according to instructions, using as a base coat, applying color, then using it as a top coat and it would be gorgeous and shiny at first. After a day or two the entire coat of polish would just peel off my nail, leaving them dull and dingy looking.</li>
    <li> This product serves as a better top coat than a base coat. I found that my nail polish chipped more when I used it for both base and top coats than when I used a different base coat and this as the top coat. I saw no difference in nail strength when I used it alone.</li>
    <li> Contains no formaldehyde so better for nails.</li>
