      <li>Very cute!</li>
      <li>Great, great purchase.</li>
      <li>great set for anytime of year.</li>
      <li>This set was great a rainbow of assorted colors.</li>
      <li>the grosgrain ribbon is a nice quality!  </li>
      <li>These barrettes are metal with pointed teeth, and s very strong grip.</li>
      <li>The come apart very easily</li>
      <li>The range of colors is nice, and if you were buying these for a child, I think you could find one to coordinate with most outfits.  </li>
      <li>Super cute!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
      <li>Stay in our toddler&#x27;s fine hair all day and holds it out of her face.</li>
      <li>They are a great buy for the price although I can&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars because they are not completely wrapped with fabric</li>
      <li>Easy to clip into my daughters hair, I tie up her pig tails with an elastic band first.</li>
      <li>They stay in my toddlers hair great and the colors are exactly as pictured, but the clip for a baby wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate as it is a little tougher than the fully covered clips.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping time.</li>
      <li>Adorable and actually stay in my toddlers hair!</li>
      <li>The pink is the best, as there is two shades of pink that are very close to eachother.</li>
      <li>These look very cute on my little girl.  </li>
      <li>The first set was much better, useful, even if in a few months they&#x27;ve all fallen apart.</li>
      <li>️😊 thanks so much</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re gentle too, so they don&#x27;t snag when removing.</li>
      <li>They stay in very well.  </li>
      <li>The red color is more of a burgundy/maroon, wish it was brighter red</li>
      <li>They stay on longer than expected and must be comfortable</li>
      <li>they are covered which is perfect for baby hair and they are small enough to fly under the radar and not get ripped out or be annoying to my baby.</li>
      <li>Bought and sent to my dil for our new granddaughter.  </li>
      <li>they took a long time to arrive but they&#x27;re worth the wait.</li>
      <li>Not only are they super affordable but they actually stay in my 6 month old&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t use these for my 9 month old.</li>
      <li>The bows are for my 2 year old niece.</li>
      <li>They have stayed in for hours, even when she is running around and playing outside which is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Still better than any other prices from other stores</li>
      <li>love the colors and I use different colors  everyday!</li>
      <li>It is nice to give her a little accessory since she is all black.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s currently 21/2 months old.</li>
      <li>Received order in 5 days not long at all</li>
      <li>This is our second set and these are clearly a cheap knock off or something (which is crazy because these were pretty cheap/poorly made to begin with).  </li>

<li> Received order in 5 days not long at all</li>
<li> This is our second set and these are clearly a cheap knock off or something (which is crazy because these were pretty cheap/poorly made to begin with).  </li>
<li> Completely off center, glue sticking out everywhere and such a big gap between the two pieces that these don&#x27;t have a prayer of holding any hair down.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s pretty sharp on the end and could hurt my little one if we aren&#x27;t ultra careful.</li>
<li> I put them in the hair on her ears which is about an inch long.  </li>
<li> I received all pink except 3 yellow ones.</li>
<li> Pros: Lots of different colors (so you can match with different outfits), simple, cute&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not entirely wrapped, so there is exposed metal on the barrettes, which isn&#x27;t preferably with delicate baby hair.</li>
<li> The bottom part of the clip is not covered with ribbon and is sharp enough to slice the child!</li>
<li> the little alligator clips have fabric on the back, so no metal touches the baby&#x27;s head!</li>
<li> Alligator clips held her thin hair very well.&lt;br</li>
<li> All dark colors, just loose in a box from amazon.  </li>
<li> very sharp.</li>
<li> I wound up with a few colors I will never use</li>
<li> so is a little hard on the head.</li>
<li> and the barrette pieces are dangerously SHARP!!!</li>
<li> The must have paid attention to their past reviews because they have now added ribbon around the clip so it is fully covered.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a bit afraid to use them because the bottom part of the clip is this naked aluminum part.</li>
<li> I did not buy because even though they are listed as &amp;#34;barrettes&amp;#34;, they are merely hair clips.</li>
<li> Not good for toddlers!!  </li>
<li> awful.</li>

    <li> Easy to clip into my daughters hair, I tie up her pig tails with an elastic band first. They stay on longer than expected and must be comfortable bc she doesn&#x27;t pull them out of her hair. The red color is more of a burgundy/maroon, wish it was brighter red</li>
    <li> Bought and sent to my dil for our new granddaughter.  Didn&#x27;t see them myself, but dil says they&#x27;re not so &amp;#34;MINI&amp;#34; will have to wait for baby to get a bit bigger.  She&#x27;s currently 21/2 months old.</li>
    <li> No fabric on the back, larger than bows on the photo, glue sticks out of bow and bows are not proportional. Not good for toddlers!!  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Not as pictured - either in color or style or number.  This is our second set and these are clearly a cheap knock off or something (which is crazy because these were pretty cheap/poorly made to begin with).  We only got 10.  All dark colors, just loose in a box from amazon.  Completely off center, glue sticking out everywhere and such a big gap between the two pieces that these don&#x27;t have a prayer of holding any hair down.  The first set was much better, useful, even if in a few months they&#x27;ve all fallen apart.</li>
    <li> I received these clips in 3 days! Very fast shipping time. They are a great buy for the price although I can&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars because they are not completely wrapped with fabric so is a little hard on the head. They stay in my toddlers hair great and the colors are exactly as pictured, but the clip for a baby wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate as it is a little tougher than the fully covered clips.</li>
    <li> The come apart very easily</li>
    <li> I did not buy because even though they are listed as &amp;#34;barrettes&amp;#34;, they are merely hair clips.</li>
    <li> Adorable and actually stay in my toddlers hair! They&#x27;re gentle too, so they don&#x27;t snag when removing.</li>
    <li> love the colors and I use different colors  everyday!</li>
    <li> Super cute! Only 4 stars because the colors pictured did not all come. I wound up with a few colors I will never use but that&#x27;s what happens with these overseas products. Still better than any other prices from other stores so it&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
    <li> Best bows. Stay in our toddler&#x27;s fine hair all day and holds it out of her face. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> the colours are great!  the little alligator clips have fabric on the back, so no metal touches the baby&#x27;s head! the grosgrain ribbon is a nice quality!  I would definitely buy these again!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit afraid to use them because the bottom part of the clip is this naked aluminum part. It&#x27;s pretty sharp on the end and could hurt my little one if we aren&#x27;t ultra careful. Wish it was plastic.</li>
    <li> These look very cute on my little girl.  They don&#x27;t seem to pull her hair or bother her on her head.  Lots of colors to choose from and you are almost guaranteed to find a color to match their outfit!</li>
    <li> The bows are for my 2 year old niece. This set was great a rainbow of assorted colors. Alligator clips held her thin hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;A great set for anytime of year.</li>
    <li> perfect! they are covered which is perfect for baby hair and they are small enough to fly under the radar and not get ripped out or be annoying to my baby. they took a long time to arrive but they&#x27;re worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered these for my poodle/cockerspaniel mix dog. They stay in very well.  It is nice to give her a little accessory since she is all black. I put them in the hair on her ears which is about an inch long.  They have stayed in for hours, even when she is running around and playing outside which is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish there was two of each color, so we could put two in at once.  However, there are some colors that coordinate well together, so we have used two at the same time.  The pink is the best, as there is two shades of pink that are very close to eachother. The range of colors is nice, and if you were buying these for a child, I think you could find one to coordinate with most outfits.  If you plan on using two at the same time, for pigtails, I would buy two packages though!</li>
    <li> Pros: Lots of different colors (so you can match with different outfits), simple, cute&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not entirely wrapped, so there is exposed metal on the barrettes, which isn&#x27;t preferably with delicate baby hair.</li>
    <li> The colors that come to you are not as shown! and the barrette pieces are dangerously SHARP!!! The bottom part of the clip is not covered with ribbon and is sharp enough to slice the child!</li>
    <li> I received all pink except 3 yellow ones. The description said 1 of each color.</li>
    <li> This is the best purchase ever! Not only are they super affordable but they actually stay in my 6 month old&#x27;s hair. The must have paid attention to their past reviews because they have now added ribbon around the clip so it is fully covered. Great, great purchase.</li>
    <li> Very cute! Well made!</li>
    <li> Should have read the reviews. These barrettes are metal with pointed teeth, and s very strong grip. Can&#x27;t use these for my 9 month old. I thought they were covered in ribbon.</li>
    <li> awful. they look nothing like the picture. very sharp. junk. shipped from china. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Received order in 5 days not long at all and there so perfect for my baby girl and she has a lot hair and they hold ☺️😊 thanks so much</li>
