      <li>I&#x27;m super happy it&#x27;s finally at a cheaper price here on Amazon than I can get it at the store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m male with short hair on the sides and longer hair on top, and this is one of the best products for my longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>However, over the course of the day, it dries out significantly, so that you have to reapply and restyle.</li>

      <li>This product works great and shaping my hair after it&#x27;s dry!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product came as promised and was in brand new condition.  I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> My son loves this, it helps with keeping his hair in place with out looking stiff I use it also when I am trying to keep my hair in a bun it holds the strands of hair in place.</li>
    <li> ...I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ve only used it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up this morning and was able to reshape my hair as I wanted. I mean I&#x27;m going to go shower and stuff, but this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to do the trick with my motorcycle helmet as as far as I can tell is a cost effective solution.</li>
    <li> I tried this product when Garnier stopped selling its soft curl cream. I have thick curly hair that gets frizzy and out of control and look for products that will not weigh my hair down or make it look wet or stiff. This product works well. It took a few tries to figure out the right amount of it. I usually have to use more than the recommended amount of any product, but I didn&#x27;t with this one. Too much of it make my hair look especially dull and flat, but with the right amount, I get fabulous and frizz-free curls. The only downside is that it gives me the worst bed head I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I love this putty.  I makes it very easy to style my hair and once I get it where I want it, it will stay for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> There is no way I&#x27;m paying 10 or 12 bucks for a tiny jar of hair wax. Fortunately, I don&#x27;t need to, because this stuff does the job. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or make my hair look dirty, it provides a nice textured look with enough control, and -- one of my most important criteria -- it has a neutral, not overly strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult for guys to purchase hair products at a reasonable price that smell masculine. This product has a great texture and a clean smell that most guys would appreciate. The product is comparable to many salon products I have purchased over the years including American Crew, Redken, and Kiehl. I used to spend a fortune on this stuff..... Not any more as this has comparable quality and texture as those overpriced salon brands.   PROS:  -Inexpensive  -Same quality as any overpriced salon brand  -Great smell  CONS:   -Goes fast! This is a small container and usually only lasts me 3 weeks of daily use.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- non-greasy (doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair or make it oily)&lt;br /&gt;- gives texture/volume to your hair&lt;br /&gt;- has pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- very tiny&lt;br /&gt;- only really works for short hair</li>
    <li> Claims that it gives hair a reworkable hold is absolutely false, it left my hair with a strong unpleasant perfume smell and it dried leaving my hair crusty which is exactly what i didn&#x27;t want. luckily i purchased this at the local Walmart and promptly returned it. absolutely terrible product! reworkable hold? Not hardly.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t buy this any where in my area. Have tried numerous other puttys but keep coming back to L&#x27;Oreal.  Not heavy on the hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every type of putty out there, this is the cheapest and best product I have found. Good consistency and great hold. Stays in after a bit of sweating. Easier on the pocket than American Crew or other brands</li>
    <li> I used to use another product, but they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  I was distraught, because I&#x27;m a giant girl about my hair (I&#x27;m really a guy, just for the record...I just really like my hair a certain way.).  So I began an exhaustive search for a new hair product that would meet my standards of holding my hair without making it like I had done my hair in a cement truck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this, and I was skeptical.  I was taught that you got what you paid for with grooming products, and this stuff is so cheap, there is NO way it would work right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it for the first time, and put my finger in it, I was even more skeptical.  It felt very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, I put it in my hair, and I was amazed at the results.  I&#x27;m not kidding when I say this is the best product I have ever used on my hair.  It holds great, even in windy conditions.  And when I shower, it washes out without leaving my hair feeling greasy or crusty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you, this product will make you at least 20% sexier.  Unless you have no hair.  Because if you have no hair, there&#x27;s not much this product can do for you.</li>
    <li> This product works great and shaping my hair after it&#x27;s dry!  LOVE IT and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than other products I&#x27;ve checked into.  I will continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> Five words for any person who wants a super smart hairdo - L&#x27;oreal Paris Overworked Hair Putty!  Especially great for short-gamin, pixie, Lisa Rinna type styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its tacky but goes on smooth and soft.  Great for frizzies and for shaping a hairstyle - like flipping little ends up.  In Cannes recently when I took my 40 year long hair style to super short, the hairdstylist (super good - Canadian,Darius, at the Martinez!) said I would need putty to make this style (like Lisa Rinna&#x27;s) really work and, stateside, I looked and looked but couldn&#x27;t find clay or putty products anywhere - then came across this in Walgreen&#x27;s.  Amazing results.  Check out all the reviews on line.  Because it was tacky, I was initially reticent in applying it.  But found after washing and drying if you apply at roots and work it out, then come upright (it will look like an overblown mess) but then as you  begin shaping it with your fingertips, moving and flipping little pieces up or taking it in any direction you want - it truly IS fabulous.  5 Stars - No!  10 Stars from me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of hair styling products over the years and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sad thing is that I can&#x27;t seem to find it in the local stores anymore, so I have had to start ordering it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only product that I have found which has all day long re-workable hold (as long as you&#x27;re not swimming or showering), and it maintains a dry hair look without being sticky or crunchy to the touch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Loreal Overworked Hair Putty for a few years now and for me, it&#x27;s the best thing out on the market now. However the all-time best putty ever was Salon Selectives Control[d] Substance Molding Putty, which sadly was discontinued and the brand is also no longer around.  This Loreal putty is not as good but good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without water, it goes on pretty thick and pasty, which you may like if you want to create specific shapes; but for quickly creating a controlled messy look, just add tad of water and you&#x27;ll be set. I have really thick, coarse hair and the thickness of this putty allows it to shape the hair where gels and mousses generally fail. I really like that this putty has matte finish. There are so many putties out there that look similar but one you put it in your hair, it&#x27;s very slick and looks/feels greasy.  The Loreal is also fairly low in odor so it&#x27;s not going to affect you or anyone around you.  The great thing is that the putty will hold shape all day. The only complaint I have is that it feels really greasy (tho matte finish) so best not to touch your hair until you get home and take a shower. It does wash away completely with just water, without sticky residue like some of the other putties out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may very well be other better putties out there but some putties are just ridiculously priced at $15 for the same size as this Loreal.  It appears that the overall price has increased to ~$5 pricepoint. I do remember being able to buy this for about $3 for quite some time before.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well to keep fine baby hair tamed but it doesn&#x27;t hold up against an active toddler. I use it myself occasionally. Has a strong perfume that is pleasant but some may not like.</li>
    <li> I think the Product is good, but the top layer was  stiffened.  It seemed like The product was stocked in the storage for a while. After getting rid of the top layer, the bottom was soft and smooth and was good to use. I would have given 5 star, if the product was intact</li>
    <li> This product is a little too potent for me. It has a strong scent, but it does hold pretty well. I&#x27;ve been using the got2b chaotic product more often, which I like better. It has less chemicals in it for one (but still does have chemicals!) and less of a scent. Although, I don&#x27;t think the chaotic product holds AS well, but it&#x27;s comparable.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this previously at a Walmart but could never find it in any stores at all.  I like it a lot because it doesn&#x27;t gum up your hair as much as other similar products so you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair as often.</li>
    <li> I have tried many salon-brand texturizers in the past.  You would think those expensive salon products should give you great results.  Unfortunately none of them gave me satisfying results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw L&#x27;Oreal Overworked Hair Putty in a local drugstore one day.  I bought it because I thought the product name was funny and wanted to know what it can do.  Boy was I happy that I made the purchase!  I finally found a texturizer that works.  The Overworked Putty not only creates the best effect but it does not weigh my hair down or make it greasy at the end of the day.  I had to wash my hair every day because those salon brand products always made my hair greasy. Yikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what a texturizer can (or should) do until I used the Overworked Hair Putty.  It&#x27;s the best product ever--and affordable too.  Great for the value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this paste. I am a woman with short hair and like to have it looking slightly tussled. This gives me a medium hold without a wet look or stickiness.</li>
    <li> Overworked is the best texturizing control I&#x27;ve found.  My head was shaved for surgery after a head trauma and it grew back grey and fine.  I&#x27;ve kept it short in an effort to manage it better and have tried almost every hair putty, paste and texturizer sold.  Nothing worked until I found Loreal Overworked.  My hair stays where I put it and even goes back into shape when I take off a hat I have worn all day.  It is miracle control for problem hair!!  I will never be without it.    Also delivery was fast and packaging excellent!!  I will keep reordering from this seller.</li>
    <li> I like this hair putty best--even better than what the hair salon uses. Has just the right amount of styler to me.  I&#x27;ll continue using it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product. It seems none of the local supermarkets, drug stores or discount stores are carrying it any longer. Glad I could buy in a two pack.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length fine hair and winter used to drive me nuts because my hair would get static-y and fly all over the place. This product solves the problem! After I shower, I blowdry my hair about 80% dry, comb a bit of this in with my fingers, and finish drying my hair. No whispies!</li>
    <li> This stuff may work for some but it has no effect whatsoever on my hair. The price seemed reasonable, but this is a very tiny jar of hair styling putty. Instructions say to use a dime sized portion, so I guess if it worked, it might be a good buy. My hair is fine and straight, medium length, layered and I was looking for something to help my hair hold body that it otherwise lacks. I have used &amp;#34;Wired&amp;#34; hair product  for many years but have been looking for a replacement since they changed the formulation of it  into something watered down and useless. But this is no replacement for what Wired used be to. At least not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m male with short hair on the sides and longer hair on top, and this is one of the best products for my longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I&#x27;ve found is that it causes dandruff-like &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t wash your hair after 5ish hours, so if you&#x27;re going out for the night, it&#x27;ll probably come out towards the end. It&#x27;s hardly noticeable, though. Hairspray seems to cancel out the effect.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, does what it says, it&#x27;s not expensive, holds my hair in the way I want, doesn&#x27;t leave hair hard as spray does. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife has been unable to find this product area stores, but being able to order it online has been wonderful for her.  She has always used this product, and she loves the way that it helps her style her shorter hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I recently went from having incredibly long hair to a pixie/boy cut. Great decision, but hair product that allowed me to wash n&#x27; go was difficult to find.  This is it. A small amount goes a long way. Allows me to keep my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; in place while eliminating the helmet head or sticky look. Love it!</li>
    <li> My husband is into his looks... and has every reason to be! But this simple, inexpensive product is what he does his hair with every single day. He freaks out if he doesn&#x27;t have it. He thinks it&#x27;s much better than similar expensive products such as American Crew. Walgreens no longer carries Loreal brand, but you can get this at Stop and Shop or online. Please never stop making!</li>
    <li> I think everyone&#x27;s hair responds differently to different products.  This is okay, just not as good as another one I bought, for my hair. Mine is thick and heavy, although it is very short, and I wanted something to spike it. (I bought 2 kinds to try...the prices here are great, and so is free shipping!!)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have ordered twice and it has been great for my fine hair.  I just blow dry and then tussle my hair with a little bit of this on my finger tips and then style with my fingers.  It really helps me obtain and maintain volume.  I did buy this once from CVS and it had been on the shelf a long time and it wasn&#x27;t the same consistency - it was almost dried out.  My purchases on amazon have been perfect.</li>
    <li> This was a terrible terrible purchase.  I thought the pricing was for a pack of 4-6 - as these retail for about $4 each!!!  When only one arrived - I felt totally taken advantage of.  And from a Vet no less.  I found this disgraceful.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years. I use this as a texturizer primarily. It gives my hair a slight clumped look (when I want it). I can run my fingers through my hair to break up some of the clumps if I want to.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t really know what to say about this other than it suits my needs nicely.</li>
    <li> I have fine, short hair and was hoping that this product would help define my recent pixie do... Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t even tell that I have any product in.. which is nice since I didn&#x27;t want it to make my hair super firm, but it doesn&#x27;t hold any style. Disappointed since I had high hopes after reading other reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes my hair look great. I have medium long wavy hair and it&#x27;s the only product that works for it...</li>
    <li> very light product to use on hair. bought this for my teenage brother who has lots of volume on top and he uses it everyday!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair putty. Very workable, and leaves my hair styled but not stiff. I love it!</li>
    <li> I will join the vast majority of other reviewers on this product - it&#x27;s great, and the low price and wide commercial availability are simply plusses.  I let my containers of the putty &#x27;air out&#x27; with the top removed for about 12 hours so that the putty is a little stiffer; it is certainly usable otherwise, but I find that the product works better if the consistency of the putty is a little stiffer/firmer.</li>
    <li> I usually use the American Crew Forming Clay and decided to try this out because it was a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;I see now why it was cheaper. The hold on this hair putty is much less than what I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to work into the hair but you have to use a good deal of it if you want a firm hold, this ends up washing out any cost savings over the more expensive hair products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had long hair all my life and six months ago I cut it into a pixie. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with various styling products to get the look I want. I&#x27;ve tried salon brands as well as drug store brands. It&#x27;s taken some effort for me to get used to how much and what type of product to use since the short hair thing is a whole new experience for me. I think I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect product in this Overworked Hair Putty! I am finally loving my hair! This product is perfect for getting the textured, slightly messy look I love and the price can&#x27;t be beat! It&#x27;s easy to work with and only takes a small amount raked through my hair - easy, perfect, fabulous!</li>
    <li> I needed something to lay my hair down in the back. It&#x27;s really short.&lt;br /&gt;This lays it down but it leaves a residue.</li>
    <li> Very good paste to style your hair with medium hold. You should only need about a fingertip of paste to rub around in your hands to run through your hair. This amount will last a conservative user about a month.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably my thick hair but I&#x27;ve spoken to two others with thinner, longer and shorter hair and they also say the same thing.  And we only used it very lightly.  At first it seems to be okay but the slow fall begins.</li>
    <li> I like FX Texture Dirt and Molding Wax better; this product tends to be sticky, even later in the day. However I still do use this from time to time, mainly when I am out of FX. Besides the tactile issues, it does the job for styling and hold without looking like you have a lot of hair product in.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  Its the best stuff I&#x27;ve found for my hair.  Texture, hold, smell are all very good</li>
    <li> Initially, this is a great product for ~8-10 hours if applied to dry-ish hair. It&#x27;s thick, but easy to work with once you warm it up in your hands. However, over the course of the day, it dries out significantly, so that you have to reapply and restyle. Note - drying out doesn&#x27;t mean that a few hairs come loose.  Drying out means it shrinks and becomes grainy, so that it looks like there&#x27;s dust in your hair.  It&#x27;s enough for a workday, but not through the night.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!!!!  I can&#x27;t find it at any of my usual haunts anymore, but this vendor delivered!  My hair is very fine, somewhat thin, and very straight.  A little touch of this on my roots and instant volume!!!!  Is is not greasy or sticky - just the right waxy texture for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have thick/wavy hair and I always have a problem with frizzy hair when I wear my hair natural.  This helps me be happy with my natural hair.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need to use too much of this! And economical way to buy and certainly a convenient way to order.</li>
    <li> great product does what I want just wish it was a larger size.  I think this is the best product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This cream holds great and beats the crap out of the expensive salon brands. I&#x27;m a man who used to use men&#x27;s products, now I use L&#x27;oreal thanks to my ladies suggestion.</li>
    <li> Great stuff to groom my hair.  Not too stiff and not too greasy.  Has a nice smell too.  I look younger, more desirable, sexy and luscious.  Buy it you cheapskates, it&#x27;s only about $5.</li>
    <li> While this might be helping some, I&#x27;m still looking for something that will hold my curls all day without a lot of hairspray.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product, I also bought another similar for $ 13. I tought that this one would be the worst of the two, but would still work as a spare. In fact, this was the best product, and I have already bought other 3 of this. I reccomended it to my brother and he also loves it. It keeps your hair on hold without giving it a strange look.</li>
    <li> I usually buy Bed Head Manipulator and I thought this would be comparable...  it was not.  Dries stiff.  Rather than being piecy and pliable, it was dry and fluffy.  YUCK!</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is the best product I have found for the money hands down.  It has above average hold, a mild smell, and drys quickly to a matte finish.  It is extremely pliable (easy to work) and goes on smooth.  The only downside to this product I have found after 2 weeks of use, is that is drys out your hair very slightly, but that is easily overcome by mixing products together.  Personally, I tried mixing this product with American Crew Fiber, and wow, the result was a very Gosling-esque look that now only lasted the entire day, but actually looks better as the day goes on.  It was remarkable how amazing my hair looked before my evening shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, buy this product, and a lot of it.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have used for the past several years. It&#x27;s easy to mold and holds well throughout the day. Unfortunately the price has gone up on this and I&#x27;m searching for an alternate. I&#x27;ve tried two different items and both aren&#x27;t working, so I&#x27;m forced to go back and pay a bit more. Previously this item sold for about $4 with free shipping, now it&#x27;s around $5 plus shipping.</li>
    <li> My son bought this and he said it is really good. Does what he needs for his hair</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;d been purchasing another professional L&#x27;Oreal paste product from the gal who cuts my hair, which I loved. L&#x27;Oreal decided to do away with it and mostly offer newer lines of similar products--mostly in very small containers for 2 to 4 times the cost. I had to go on a search and find mission to see what would come next for me. I didn&#x27;t want &amp;#34;superglue&amp;#34; on my hair, nor did I want a product that wouldn&#x27;t have any hold at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use just a tad of this--which I suggest rubbing thoroughly through your finger tips, fingers and beginnings of your palms (sometimes I even barely dampen my hands first and shake the excess water off) and then work through your hair. It sculpts my hair (which is a short to medium cut) just perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is your product!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for a friend who could not find the product in the store any longer.  She is happy with it.</li>
    <li> The idea of using something called &amp;#34;putty&amp;#34; on my hair sounded disgusting. I couldn&#x27;t quite shake the idea of something heavy, sticky, gooey. Anyway, my hair stylist told me that putty would give my hair volume and all day hold esp. In humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;So here is my scoop. I put a dink amount about dime sized in my palms, rubbed my hands together, distributed from the roots upward, hand styled, and then sort of ignored it for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;It gives me volume, feels soft to the touch, isn&#x27;t heavy feeling exactly, isn&#x27;t greasy, isn&#x27;t goofy or sticky, but my hair feels thicker and poufy. It washes out quickly at night when I take my shower.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product because it is easy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this in warm weather and I haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;ll use it during the winter months when my hair doesn&#x27;t melt, but this has been a real hair saver this past summer.</li>
    <li> It is an awesome product. Easy to give style to your hair. It also smells pretty good. I advise this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product is good for men who want some hold but not looking like it is stuck together.  Second time purchased.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve found so far. Isn&#x27;t sticky or hard and has a very light pleasant smell. (More words, more words.)</li>
    <li> This stuff is super cheap and does what I need it to do.  Only complaint is that if it rains and your hair gets wet, you will have white liquid dripping from your head all over your face and clothes.</li>
    <li> I have medium/short hair, and I typically go for the messed up bed head look.  I used to use gels, but thought about experimenting with this type.  It&#x27;s a lot thicker than gels, almost wax like.  Let me say, the finished product is where it shines.  I found it works best when you have dry hair, or just barely damp.  It doesn&#x27;t work well with wet hair, or not for me at least.  Doesn&#x27;t take much to use, but there isn&#x27;t a lot of product in the container.  I feel like I&#x27;ll go through the bottle in maybe a month.  I don&#x27;t mind, because it&#x27;s cheap in price, but I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> By far the best hair product for my hair.  Does all the work without that greasy look.  I&#x27;m super happy it&#x27;s finally at a cheaper price here on Amazon than I can get it at the store.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday because my hair behaves with the weather. It&#x27;s great! It makes the hair look very natural, styled, but not obvious like with gel. It keep the hair that way for at least 6-8 hours. And it has a good scent to it! My only concern with it is that the texture isn&#x27;t very good - it&#x27;s a bit rough and dry.</li>
