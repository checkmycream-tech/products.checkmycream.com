      <li>but it was supposed to be enough to do the whole head</li>
      <li>however, these extensions are pretty darn long.</li>

<li> I like it, but way too long for me...</li>
<li> The blue looks a little different than the picture</li>
<li> and i bought two sets because i have very long hair</li>
<li> im still ganna try to get the dark blue set</li>
<li> i wanted the black to blue and i ended up getting the bluish to teal/green color.</li>
<li> But the only problem is it&#x27;s not a full head clip because it didn&#x27;t go all around my head, but I managed to have my hair cover that part.</li>
<li> Received this in a few days.</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> You could definitely tell it was fake...</li>
<li> so i think it is obvious it is fake hair, but i still get compliments on the color and where i got it.</li>
<li> only problem i had was that they sent me the wrong color.</li>
<li> Hair is VERY thin and doesnt blend well with think hair.</li>
<li> : It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture too much &amp; is very thin.</li>

    <li> they were okay but it was supposed to be enough to do the whole head it wasn&#x27;t and I got 2 of them</li>
    <li> Baby doll hair... Looks nothing like advertisement</li>
    <li> This clip-in extension is so beautiful and vibrate looks just like the picture. Very soft. Make sure to take good care of this brand of hair because it is synthetic so doesnt curl as well. Leave in curlers work best. Be sure to wash it and try to not put a lot of products in it.</li>
    <li> im a simple person, and i love these clips. i had to order 2 sets of hair extension because i had A LOT of hair and its also very straight and long so  i had to order 2. but i love it so much and i do need to get a from because my hair is longer than the extensions and well what is the point to that. however, these extensions are pretty darn long. Thank you, i love them!!!</li>
    <li> it felt nothing like hair</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Saturday, and got it on Monday. I love it! The blue looks a little different than the picture but that&#x27;s OK it&#x27;s still bright. Deff worth buying!</li>
    <li> Pros: Nice color &amp; soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture too much &amp; is very thin. I have medium hair &amp; doesn&#x27;t look good. It could work if your hair is already really long, The clips kind of suck. It is inexpensive though, I only plan to wear it out for rave events or just pictures. DO NOT TRY TO CURLLLL!!!!! IT WILL GET BIZZZZZURRRRNED LOL</li>
    <li> Received this in a few days. Love the hair it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
    <li> Better than what i expected. looks and feels so real.</li>
    <li> It is really good! But the only problem is that the top is navy-blueish and not black, otherwise it is good!</li>
    <li> Thank you Its really pretty and soft. But the only problem is it&#x27;s not a full head clip because it didn&#x27;t go all around my head, but I managed to have my hair cover that part. Good thing I bought more than one because its very thin.</li>
    <li> i really do like it its nice and worth the price. only problem i had was that they sent me the wrong color. i wanted the black to blue and i ended up getting the bluish to teal/green color. i wasnt to bummed out cuz that was my second choice. you get what you paid for specially if your ordering from the other side of the world. but its a very nice set of extensions and i thing the color is absolutely beautiful. i did play with em with my straighter and it didn&#x27;t burn. i used the lowest heat setting on my straighter (which is basically just the ON button)and i have an infiniti conair straightner and that gets really hot, but i have not used any hotter setting on my straighter. i believe that the hair holds up to 175 degrees fahrenheit and i think the low setting on my straighter is slighlty over that like at 200. it didn&#x27;t damage it or burn it or nothing and it kept its softness. it is very long which i liked and i bought two sets because i have very long hair so it looks nice and full. its also very comfortable to wear.the color is bright so i think it is obvious it is fake hair, but i still get compliments on the color and where i got it. took a while to get hear i say about 3.5 weeks maybe. its cute. im still ganna try to get the dark blue set i think it will work better on my very dark brown hair if i get a darker blue.</li>
    <li> I recommend getting two if you really want a full headed look like the photo. But it also sheds a lot, I haven&#x27;t even brushed it and it&#x27;s shedding everywhere.</li>
    <li> I like it, but way too long for me... Did not blend in well with my hair. You could definitely tell it was fake... :/ I think I will stick with real hair for now on... But it is good product, just not right for me.</li>
    <li> i liked it alot i dyed it to make it a darker blue because the blue was very bright but other then that i really loved the hair (:</li>
    <li> Hair is VERY thin and doesnt blend well with think hair. It sheds when you brush it too.</li>
    <li> It is &amp;#34;awesome and kewl&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> long and thin but wear it in the bottom part of my hair, looks awesome. I get compliments on it all the time. Fast arrival too.</li>
    <li> It is what it is.  Exactly what it is suppose to be so you can&#x27;t expect anything more.</li>
