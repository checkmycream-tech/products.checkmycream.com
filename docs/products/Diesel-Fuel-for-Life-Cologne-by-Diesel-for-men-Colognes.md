      <li>you&#x27;ll be original with it too.</li>
      <li>I still have another bottle that has the original perfume.</li>
      <li>My daughter picked it for him originally, but now we have problems finding it.  </li>
      <li>My wife loves the clean smell of this</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s not enough, people tell me I smell great on a consistent basis, guys and gals.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had total strangers stop me to tell me how good I smell.</li>
      <li>This came in quick.</li>
      <li>1-2 sprays is enough, this stuff is VERY potent.  </li>
      <li>Unique and my wife very much likes as well.</li>
      <li>amazing smelling Cologne definitely recommend for any time where I into sweet and musky</li>
      <li>They had just received their first shipment and excited about the product.</li>
      <li>well worth it</li>
      <li>ladies other than my wife always tell me I smell good.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping exactly what we wanted!</li>
      <li>I have been using Diesel Fuel For Life for several years and love it.</li>
      <li>exactly what i ordered.</li>
      <li>My first time purchasing Diesel Fuel for Life was years ago.</li>
      <li>gonna order a lifetime supply bcuz it really works!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always received positive feedback on it.</li>
      <li>This one is a little more fresh and fruity smelling.</li>
      <li>Chicks really dig this scent!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>Very good&lt;br /&gt;Especially for the price</li>
      <li>My boyfriend absolutely loves it...</li>
      <li>And came so fast</li>
      <li>I do use other colognes but I  receive the most compliments when I wear Diesel.</li>
      <li>The smell is really nice and long lasting!!</li>
      <li>And bold, yet timid enough to still give off the air of wanting to be hugged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, this last time I purchased it from Amazon, wasn&#x27;t the original, it felt like a fake refill, the smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than an hour, where it used to last for more than 6 hours before!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not good at describing smells but this one smells sweet, masculine and unique!</li>
      <li>I was intrigued due to the sleeve that encased the bottle as I thought this was unique.</li>
      <li>Several of my friends have since starting wearing this product so much that Diesel should start paying me as a spokes person ;).</li>
      <li>I got this for my partner and it smells a LITTLE like the genuine product,  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Fuel for Life off and on for nearly 7 years now.</li>
      <li>Thank you for a seamless transaction.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than you can find in stores and bigger bottle.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this vs. other online stores or at the mall</li>

<li> (: Lasts long and even after a long sweaty day at work both jobs working 16 hours as day, there&#x27;s still a hint of the smell.</li>
<li> It does not linger long enough as expected.</li>
<li> I got this large bottle size because the other sizes the cologne is offered in are too small.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll continue to buy it as long as they keep making it!</li>
<li> This is the largest bottle Diesel makes and is priced as the same level as the small bottle in stores.</li>
<li> for Life has a dark but not overpowering scent and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Too bad it will not be around too much longer.</li>
<li> I&#x27;M GONNA WEAR IT EVERYDAY!</li>
<li> Complex, yet not far-fetched.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s fake!</li>
<li> But it can be very expensive.</li>
<li> False product!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff!  My daughter picked it for him originally, but now we have problems finding it.  Only downside was that I had to go to post office and sign for delivery.</li>
    <li> Excellent as expected</li>
    <li> My wife loves the clean smell of this</li>
    <li> Chicks really dig this scent!&lt;br /&gt;When you put this on, you will attract all the girls like never before!&lt;br /&gt;Im gonna order a lifetime supply bcuz it really works!</li>
    <li> The smell seem to dissipate as time goes by. It does not linger long enough as expected.</li>
    <li> False product!!! I got this for my partner and it smells a LITTLE like the genuine product,  but it&#x27;s fake!</li>
    <li> This came in quick. I love this fragrance. No problems.</li>
    <li> My man smells wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Great price and I will buy again</li>
    <li> Love the smell and so does my lady! Would purchase again, best price I have found so far. Great Deal!</li>
    <li> I got this large bottle size because the other sizes the cologne is offered in are too small. I consider it the best bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> Only the second scent I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life. This stuff makes them swoon!  I receive many compliments!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My husband smells wonderful. It was here before Christmas but I couldn&#x27;t wait for him to wear it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.....I will buy this product again and again.</li>
    <li> I go back and forth between this and Diesel&#x27;s &amp;#34;Only the Brave&amp;#34;. This one is a little more fresh and fruity smelling. Complex, yet not far-fetched. Sassy, yet not taking any sass. And bold, yet timid enough to still give off the air of wanting to be hugged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And ladies other than my wife always tell me I smell good. So that&#x27;s a bonus. I guess.</li>
    <li> amazing smelling Cologne definitely recommend for any time where I into sweet and musky and this fit just perfectly in between do yourself a favor and add this to your collection</li>
    <li> Great price for the size of the item. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> What a deal!  Too bad it will not be around too much longer. It has disappeared from retail stores.</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne that I have ever had so far! The smell is really nice and long lasting!! You gotta wear it all the time!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves the smell!</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne!!</li>

    <li> This is my all time favorite cologne! But it can be very expensive. I was really surprised by the price, this is a great deal &amp; I&#x27;ve never seen a bottle this big. Now my husband always smells great &amp; will for a long time. I highly recommend this vs. other online stores or at the mall -you won&#x27;t find a better bargain.</li>
    <li> Perfect! And came so fast</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount you get. This is the largest bottle Diesel makes and is priced as the same level as the small bottle in stores. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Great smell and lasts all day.  Grear deal.  Much cheaper than you can find in stores and bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Fast shipping exactly what we wanted!</li>
    <li> Best day time perfume i tried ( love it )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for more than 5 years now, it&#x27;s my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;However, this last time I purchased it from Amazon, wasn&#x27;t the original, it felt like a fake refill, the smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than an hour, where it used to last for more than 6 hours before! I still have another bottle that has the original perfume.</li>
    <li> AWESOME price and great shipping. It arrived I believe only 2 days after I ordered it and I chose the standard shopping option as always so I was impressed with the deal and shipping. Not to mention I always get asked which cologne I&#x27;m wearing. People love it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Christmas present. He loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne since 2008 (6 years). Still haven&#x27;t used a different brand since. Hopefully that says something regarding the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that&#x27;s not enough, people tell me I smell great on a consistent basis, guys and gals. Definitely a good pickup, and not something that a lot of people wear so you&#x27;ll be original with it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Fuel for Life off and on for nearly 7 years now. I&#x27;ve always received positive feedback on it. I&#x27;ve had total strangers stop me to tell me how good I smell. I&#x27;ll continue to buy it as long as they keep making it!</li>
    <li> I got so many compliments when I wear from both guys and girls. They always ask &amp;#34;What are you wearing it smells so good&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves it...well worth it</li>
    <li> This is one of the best perfumes I ever bought. I&#x27;m not good at describing smells but this one smells sweet, masculine and unique! I&#x27;M GONNA WEAR IT EVERYDAY!</li>
    <li> I have been using Diesel Fuel For Life for several years and love it. I have received many compliments and many people wanted to know what I was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Product was just what I was expecting. Thank you for a seamless transaction.</li>
    <li> My first time purchasing Diesel Fuel for Life was years ago. I walked into Dillard&#x27;s while the clerk was building the display for the cologne and she proceeded to tell me all about it. They had just received their first shipment and excited about the product. I was intrigued due to the sleeve that encased the bottle as I thought this was unique. She sprayed some of the product on a paper tester and handed it to me. I was hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fuel for Life has a dark but not overpowering scent and a little goes a long way. I keep a bottle of this in my bathroom and gym bag at all times. I do use other colognes but I  receive the most compliments when I wear Diesel. Several of my friends have since starting wearing this product so much that Diesel should start paying me as a spokes person ;). My mates have dubbed this cologne (ladies please excuse the crudeness of the comment I&#x27;m about to make) &#x27;The Panty Dropper&#x27;.</li>
