<li> i wear this fragrance often and it did not smell as it usually does. :-(</li>
<li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong with this unisex fragrance.</li>
<li> I got obsessed with it.</li>
<li> But i see its price is expensive comparing its size.</li>
<li> This for me is a work, casual or even a dress up scent</li>
<li> but through out the day you get sick of smelling it?</li>

    <li> Have been a big fan of Hermes perfumes for a long time and this is my latest favorite. Its light, androgynous and very appealing.</li>
    <li> This product was obviously old.  The smell was off.  i wear this fragrance often and it did not smell as it usually does. :-(</li>
    <li> I absolutely fell in love with this cologne. I&#x27;m a big fan of masculine/fresh/sour scents and this is perfect for me. It&#x27;s very intriguing and mysterious. It&#x27;s unlike any other perfumes I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Hermes has the best colognes but this one is a definite statement!! I already got the second bottle( it&#x27;s refillable) and each time I use it is like a subtle touch of butterfly.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most refined and pleasant fragrances a man can wear, it is very refreshing, energizing and appealing.&lt;br /&gt;Definitly a summer fragrance</li>
    <li> EXCELET SMELL AND FIXATION</li>
    <li> Favorite smell at all times. All of my girlfriends love it. It has a nice fresh and mysterious smell that lasts reasonably long.</li>
    <li> Voyage D&#x27;Hermes is a very fresh, green smelling cologne that if awesome quality that is expected from the Hermes house. You do see the quality stand out above other fresh colognes. This for me is a work, casual or even a dress up scent so it is very versatile.</li>
    <li> Nice scent clean with a little spice. Don&#x27;t have to put a lot on but doesn&#x27;t last long but I still like it.</li>
    <li> This cologne is my favorite! Of course, scents are extremely subjective so I am sure other people may not find it as good as I do. BUT, aside from smelling great and different than other colognes, at around $70 for this product, you can&#x27;t pass it up. I had seen it at Sephora when I went in with my girlfriend and stumbled upon it while checking out the Men&#x27;s fragrances. There, it went for around $130!!! When I saw it on Amazon for the low price, I was skeptical about the quality but upon receiving it concluded that it is the real deal (hence why I made sure it was shipped and sold by Amazon).</li>
    <li> It was stronger than I  expected and not my usual choice of a fragrance. I got alot of attention from men asking what I was wearing? It is a fragrance that is clearly bursting with pheneromes... My bottle is now outside in the cold to tone it down! I do like it, but not for everyday! Price was excellent to try something new and tres chic!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Voyage D&#x27;Hermes for years, ever since it came out.  I love the subtle scent.  I get many compliments about how great I smell.</li>
    <li> Very good porfum and small.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite fragrances!  often find myself smelling my own self (lol)!</li>
    <li> I was Sephora today, I have experienced with most popular fragrances. After having tested most of them over times, i noticed this fragrance very uniqe which i am lookin for long time ago.

    <li> My husband loves this product.  We first bought it in France when we were travelling there and just arrived on the market</li>
    <li> Love this scent!  Warm and sexy, kind of like wearing your boyfriends cotton button down.  Hermes makes scents right so they adapt to the person skin that is wearing the fragrance and becomes their own!</li>
    <li> very cheap price... almost half off compared to Nordstrom... will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Every day, any time fragrance. Clean, fresh, lively. Love it! Jeans or formal, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this unisex fragrance.</li>
    <li> This has a very light scent with hints of citrus and cypress trees.  It reminds my of the Mediterranean Sea.  The bottle is unquie, but useful at the same time.  I like that you can flip the metal piece over and protect the sprayer.  It also makes a nice little stand when it is sitting on your counter.  Definitely my favorite scent of the year.</li>
    <li> You never get tired of it. I am very picky when it comes to smells. I bought this for my husband at christmas and he loves it. It&#x27;s like nothing else.</li>
    <li> Great scent, great price. Beware of the delicate bottle though (no fault of the seller).</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift it&#x27;s a great product and smells very well.  It&#x27;s a very mature and specific smell it&#x27;s not meant for everyone.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! NEW  and in the packaging, if was well wrapped and arrived exactly on time... for the product itself its divine and luxurious.... the perfect cool scent for summer.... could not be more in love</li>
    <li> First of all, I am male.  I bought this fragrance because my girlfriend fell in love with the smell when we visited a fragrance store.  I held off on purchasing it because of the price.  Amazon has this at a steal or a bargain!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very light but very fragrant.  Very crisp and clean smelling.  Almost a hint of CK One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had many compliments from complete strangers asking what I am wearing and where did I get it from.</li>
    <li> This cool smells really good.</li>
    <li> My hubby and I both use this</li>
    <li> You know when you get a cologne and it smells good but through out the day you get sick of smelling it? Well this wont be happening with this GREAT SCENT!!</li>
    <li> Perfect! As expected!</li>
    <li> Beautiful. Etheral. Enchanting. I was simply transported to another land. I love perfumes and hoard them. Voyage d&#x27;Hermes is indeed one of the best I&#x27;ve got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I must say about Voyage D&#x27;Hermes is that it is not overpowering. It will make you smell classy. Anyone with a nose for perfume will recognize that what you&#x27;re wearing is GOOD![[ASIN:B003KQQVR2 Voyage D&#x27;Hermes by Hermes Eau-de-toilette Refillable Spray for Unisex, 3.30-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> This frangance is very sophisticated and elegant but definitely not for a young crowd (not for any crowd for that matter).&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it smells even after hours on my skin. I&#x27;d recommend it to a men or woman that likes to have a peculiar scent that can be smelt only when getting close.</li>
    <li> Lo vi en una tienda de perfumes lo probe y me gusto, lo uso de dia y de noche con muy buenos resultados.</li>
