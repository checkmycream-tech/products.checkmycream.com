<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> GREAT!!! amazing price for amazing quality.the BEST deal hands down.</li>
    <li> Smelled good and melted well. Came in a plastic tub. Good deal!</li>
    <li> No less than superb, everything that i have bought is of the finest quality. that&#x27;s how it should be when your being represented. Thank You</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It was as expected. I will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> This is some of the finest smelling cocoa butter that I have ever bought. It came in a bag instead of the plastic container. The bag is nice and has a sticker on the front that reads unrefined cocoa butter. It has a prominent spot now on the side of my workbench that customers can see. I love being able to show off my ingredients in their raw form and this definitely allows me to do that. I use the highest quantity of it in my beard wax. It makes it smell so good that now it only comes in Cocoa Beeswax and I add no other scents.</li>
    <li> Love making my own oils and lotions..</li>
    <li> I just received this product and the container is heavy damaged luckily the container is wrapped in plastic. Kinda disappointed I planned to reuse the container for other projects.</li>
    <li> This product came as shown in photo. Smells so good and works great with my homemade sunscreen and deodorant. Will be purchasing more when needed.</li>
    <li> I used this cocoa butter to make my body butter lotion and it is fantastic! Smells Wonderful and is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter comes packaged in large to medium to small chunks inside a 32 ounce sized, plastic container. I weighed the product on my kitchen scale and it was indeed a full pound of cocoa butter. The smell is heavenly (smells just like fresh cocoa). This melts down great in a double boiler or mini electric crock pot (for melting chocolate etc.) with some beeswax, shea butter, other beneficial carrier oils and essential oils for excellent lip and body balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended! A+++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: I let this cocoa butter warm to room temperature and chopped it up into smaller sizes for melting down when I need it and stored it in a quart sized mason jar with tightly sealed lid in the refrigerator to keep fresh for longer (I&#x27;ve had cocoa butter stay fresh like that for years with no rancidity issues).</li>
    <li> The cocoa  butter is very old, hard and even starting to turn white.  As one reviewer said its not even 16 oz like stated. I  was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t order from my normal source, I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.  if you want good quality I&#x27;d look else where. It definitely wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
    <li> They were nicely packaged and I am am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Best company I have bought cocoa butter from yet.  Excellent quality! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite cocoa butter purchase. I&#x27;ve made many things with it. So nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> WOW, this is so awesome.  Many uses.  I made a &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; smelling cream for use with my reflexology practice.  It leaves your skin feeling so soft!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time that I have ordered from this company, the first time the cocoa butter came in a zip-top bag, this time it is in a plastic container like the picture shows. The first batch was large chunks while this one is small pieces. They appear to have come from different sources, but both times the cocoa butter seems fresh, melts easily, and smells heavenly. I use it in lotions and lip balms and it gives a wonderful chocolate smell, and leaves your skin and lips soft and silky. I will be back for more soon!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product! did not come in cup broken up as pictured, came in partial broken block. Also is not very fragrent/fresh, and flavor not good as it should be. :( Spend more and get the better quality.</li>
    <li> Good product smells fresh</li>
    <li> Arrived timely. Not filled &amp; packed to capacity but decent amount in container. Haven&#x27;t use it yet, but I intend to make an all over body skin cream using various carrier oils.</li>
    <li> The only drawback of this is that it is very difficult to portion out how much you need to use if you are following a recipie for home made balm or the like. Other than that, this is wonderful smells great, not over processed, and melts very easily. Although it&#x27;s tough to portion, I am planning on ordering this again.</li>
    <li> *3rd photo: Top Left corner: Nativas, Top Right corner: Generic brand, Bottom left corner: The Raw Food World, Bottom Right corner: Ojio&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello everyone! If you are like me, you are trying to find the best Cacao butter for your buck. I decided to go out and buy a few different Cacao Butters and see if there was one that stood out or if they all tasted the same. (Un)Fortunately, I did notice a difference as far as quality / taste / texture / color and I will be reviewing my personal opinion on the following products: Nativas Cacao Butter, The Raw Food World, Raw Cocoa Butter (ASIN: B00BPXLTI8) and Ojio Cacao Butter - 100% Organic Arriba (as shown in the first picture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to mention I know cacao butter eaten as-is isn&#x27;t the greatest tasting. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that for any of the ones I am reviewing. However, trying a little bit plain does give you an idea of quality as far as what to expect from the cacao. It shouldn&#x27;t taste horrible but it probably won&#x27;t be something you&#x27;ll want to munch on through-out the day (ha ha!) The reviews below are based on both eating it plain side-by-side and then making the same chocolate recipe only substituting the cacao butters out with each batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st place - Navitas Naturals Cacao Butter: What can I say--this Cacao butter has a beautiful texture to it. It is smooth to the touch and almost melts in your mouth. It comes in a square block, smells heavenly, and has a lovely light brown shade to it. I definitely could tell a difference in the chocolate I made with this cacao butter (and so could my parents). It melted quickly in my pan into a lovely golden puddle that mixed smoothly with my other ingredients. Only con I can think of is the price (it&#x27;s a little more expensive than the rest). But seriously, since a calorie is a calorie, I think I&#x27;ll spend the extra few bucks and enjoy my chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd Place - Raw Organic Cacao Butter, 16oz, The Raw Food World: This is, by far, the one I would buy in a heartbeat if I was looking for a cheaper, but good quality cacao butter. The texture isn&#x27;t as smooth as Nativas, but I personally think it has a unique, different flavor (almost fruity like). It also has a light brown shade to it, but not as brown as Navitas. Smells great and comes in chunks. Will be buying this again in the future :) Makes yummy, smooth chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd Place - Raw Cocoa Butter (ASIN: B00BPXLTI8): Hmmmmmmm....Quality seemed to be lacking compared to the other two. Texture was not pleasant--almost gummed up in my mouth as I chewed on it (kind of freaky because you&#x27;d think it would dissolve more easily like the others). The butter itself seemed dry as it crumbled when broken. Wasn&#x27;t really smooth and the color was a yellowish tint. It smelled lovely though. The taste didn&#x27;t match up to the smell though :( It did a good job at giving me a smooth chocolate but the chocolate itself didn&#x27;t seem as rich and flavorful compared to the two reviewed above. Will not be purchasing this again for cooking. Maybe this would be better for making personal care products (which I will be doing in the near future).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th Place - Ojio Cacao Butter - 100% Organic Arriba: What a letdown. I really was hoping for something better than what I got as I love their Raw Cacao Beans. Texture was also hard like the generic 3rd place cocoa butter. Didn&#x27;t really have any smell. The color was also yellowish but not as yellow (more pale). The quality seemed to be lacking--I would have placed this in the 3rd place spot but the only reason it got bumped down here to the 4th place is because it didn&#x27;t have any taste when eaten plain. It didn&#x27;t gum up in my mouth though when I chewed on it. Maybe it was a bad batch but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, these reviews are based my personal taste / experience when making chocolate and eating them. I realize that the brownish / yellowish tint for the cacao butter is probablybased on the cacao bean itself that they harvested the butter from. With that being said, I will be trying my best to purchase cacao butter with a brownish tint over a yellowish tint if I venture out to purchase a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your cacao butter purchases! I know what it&#x27;s like trying to find that perfect ingredient when cooking for yourself! I&#x27;ll do my best to update this as I purchase other Cacao butter (I&#x27;m wanting to give Sunfood&#x27;s a try) Also, feel free to leave a comment if you&#x27;ve tried any of the ones above or have any recommendations for cacao butter to use for chocolate as I am always eager to try something new :)based on the cacao bean itself that they harvested the butter from.

    <li> Love making  bodybutter, makes my skin so soft</li>
    <li> I bought this to make homemade lip gloss with my daughters. I did some reading and even as an armature I am aware that cocoa butter melts very easy. Somehow the folks selling this didn&#x27;t seem to care. It was boxed with some other items I had purchased form amazon and it was laying on its side and melted everywhere when the carrier left the box on my porch, in Texas in 103 degree heat!</li>
    <li> It arrived well before the date indicated but it has a wonderful aroma. I&#x27;m actually pleased that it isn&#x27;t melted and poured into the jar. It gives the appearance (at least) of being raw and unprocessed. And for the price, you can&#x27;t really beat it! Will order again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to measure out, without melting; but other than that, I like it.  The smell is absolutely wonderful and it gave my homemade hair/body butter a creamier texture.  So, I will buy it, again.</li>
    <li> I loved it. I use it to make all the homemade cosmetics and its very moisturizing. love the smell too.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I expected from the description. The quality is excellent. The chunks can be a little tough to break up for accurate measuring but it melts and mixes easily. It&#x27;s smooth, creamy and exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come as advertized and arrived in a silver sealed bag not a plastic container as said with the product being all grity and hard to dissolve or melt. I wouldn&#x27;t buy from this company again or recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving my shipment i discovered that the deli container it was in broke open and had melted all over my other items. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have time to return it, so I had to break it up and transfer it to another container, witch was very messy. the butter worked fine for my project though</li>
    <li> I was concerned about the amount as some reviews mentioned being shorted. I weighed the full container when I received it and it was 17.2 oz, perfect (assuming the container and lid are 1.2 oz). This is great raw cocoa butter. Smells good, feels good on my skin, and mixes easily in my body butter recipe. Also shipped quickly, it arrived before the rest of my PRIME order. Very happy customer here.</li>
    <li> This arrived on time and looks exactly like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It sat on my counter for a few weeks and then I used a small portion to make chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;It suits my needs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Looking for other DIY recipes to make something else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s of 👍 Good quality.. It melts down great.. I use it on skin an hair.. It keeps both well moisturized very well..</li>
    <li> Received this container today.  It seems to be the real thing.  It looks, feels and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A happy customer.</li>
    <li> This is great for skin when mixed with oils very moisturizing and its smells great it was definitely pure it was rock hard when it arrived and I had to melt our and then add my oils and aloe vera gel it lasted a long time too I have always used cocoa butter since I wad little but I definitely prefer to make my own than store bought I plan on purchase this again</li>
    <li> great for travel, just slip a junk in a ziplock bag and away you go. smells wonderful and leaves your skin soft and silky</li>
    <li> this item is great, have already used to make body butter, it just surprised me some when it came in a different packaging. but i love it.</li>
    <li> Great price, thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This is food grade, smells and tastes like cocoa. Is pretty firm so can easily be grated for use in home made skin products. If they don&#x27;t raise the price I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a homemade hair conditioner. Some of the cocoa butter escaped the packaging but no damage to the other items that were shipped with it, which I was worried about since the cocoa butter melted a little in shipping.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m very unhappy with this product. The butter itself comes in a \\&quot;deli cup style\\&quot; container that can hold 16ozs. However, the amount of cocoa butter inside the container isnt anywhere near that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a couple other items in my order (not from this company) that were 1lb/16 oz by weight and let me tell you, they were far heavier than this container! So I decided to weigh this carton of cocoa butter. It weighed, on my very accurate gram scale, about 11.5 oz. I was very unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think it is okay for a company to label something as \\&quot;16 oz\\&quot; when in fact the product inside isn&#x27;t that much. I don&#x27;t care if the container is a 16oz container, if I&#x27;m not getting that amount of product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a small town and this was my only access to cocoa butter, so unhappy as i was about the clear deceit concerning weight, I still had to use it or risk the project that needed it being pushed too far back. I opened the container to find old gritty crumbled butter. Not premium small chunks or granules they would lead you to believe. Almost no yummy chocolate smell, which is a good indicator of age.</li>
    <li> love it!!  I used it in my recipe for lotion bars and it is very moisturizing</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase of raw cocoa butter, It save me the time and money of traveling 1hr to NYC for looking for it.</li>
    <li> I received my raw Cocoa Butter as promised and as described. It comes exactly as pictured but wrapped in plastic so you know you&#x27;re getting a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the butter, it smells almost like chocolate! The aroma isn&#x27;t strong so that&#x27;s a bonus! I haven&#x27;t melted it yet but I&#x27;ve taken a tiny piece and rubbed it against my skin on my arm. Surprisingly, it left a non-greasy SHEEN behind and made it feel SOFT!!! And, no, it doesn&#x27;t melt with your body heat so you have to take some out and melt it in the microwave or on the stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this will be a staple in my skin care regimen. I&#x27;m using this as a base for my homemade body butter w/ coconut oil, evoo, and aloe vera gel :) My skin loves this stuff and so do I! And I will be purchasing again from this company soon. Very Satisfied Customer!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Lasts a long time.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent and a great deal! My package arrived very safely. I had big chunks and small bits. When I weighed my tub, I had over 16oz, closer to 18oz. The quality of the product was also wonderful. I use it to make lip balm and it melts up nicely.</li>
    <li> Great quantity for the price</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! This was such a good purchase! I have made whipped body butter with it, facial cream, and stretch mark lotion with it. It works so well for so many different things!</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this coco butter it arrived in a sealed metaltic bag and inside that was a clear plastic bag with a twist tie. As soon as I opened it I could smell the coco butter. I wish it came in a different container I don&#x27;t know if its 16oz or not. I&#x27;m going to try to whip it so I can have a easier application of the butter although hard it do start to melt with my own body heat. But I have to break it off from the chunk I was sent. I hoping this coco butter help soften/fade my stretch marks and faded some dark marks on my body. I know its going to take a while and more purchases but as long as I can make this into a whipped cocobutter I don&#x27;t mind cause I don&#x27;t like that I have to break it off like that.</li>
    <li> buying in bulk is great for soap, lotion, and lip balms. It makes the products smell and feel wonderful!!  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I have little experience with the various butters out there, but was wanting to try hard lotions as well as body butters. This cocoa butter was as stated, has a wonderful &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; chocolate smell, and works up well in the hard lotion bars. Would definitely order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable sent! I purchased this to mix with Shea butter and coconut oil for a little project. The scent is unbelieveable.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this a couple times and really enjoy this product. I use it at night on my hands and feet before bed and in the morning they are soft again (:  I use all the larger pieces first and when I get down to the flakes that are left, I microwave them until they are soft and then roll them into a large piece. It is raw with no fillers so don&#x27;t expect it to be like store bought garbage with all the additives! It smells fantastic too!</li>
    <li> it works well but it came in and was not a full pound., it only weighed in at 14 oz not a full 16.</li>
    <li> I buy cocoa butter once a year and make a big batch of whipped body butter! This makes the body butter smell so divine</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Smelled very fresh when I opened it with that wonderful smell of chocolate.  Just rubbing it on your hands before using it in soaps and body butters makes your hands feel smooth and satiny.  I too have a gram scale and I got a smudge more than the 16oz.  A very satisfied customer and won&#x27;t hesitate to buy from again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a container of pretty flakes like the photo, but I got a ziploc bag, and some of it was all crumbly, which ended up being melted anyway, I just thought it would look like it was represented</li>
    <li> The cocoa butter came packaged in a plastic bin, as shown, and shrink wrapped as well.  It smooths on beautifully, and smells fantastic!  I look forward to using this in my body butters, and on its own as well.</li>
    <li> The quality and smell was good to me. I have used other cocoa butters and this one is pretty good. My biggest problem was that this was not actually 16oz. . I feel a little cheated. Sell what you advertise. Its not that hard.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. Wonderful product. Very good quality. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I got this to make lotion with. The smell is heavenly. I was going to ass essential oils to the lotion but I might keep it with this original smell.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on coco butter before I decided to order this. I will admit I was nervous and couldn&#x27;t wait for the arrival to see if I had made a mistake by ordering this. I am very pleased with this product so far. It has all the characteristics of natural coco butter from what I researched.  It arrived 3days early and Very well packaged.  The product looks exactly like the picture (if not better), plus it has a company label on the front of it giving details about the company and the product. The coco butter has a chocolate aroma, and the texture is like a smooth moisture clay texture. I have melted some of the butter already. It melted very easily and once it melts it looks like regular butter/oil.  I assume this product will last a long time because it doesn&#x27;t take much of the product once melted, and the container was completely full as on the photo.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to make my own skin moisturizing products and it was very easy to use. It melts at low temps and mixes well with my other ingredients. A little goes a long way so the amount of product for the price is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> The creamy texture and &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; feeling of this butter is heavenly. It really feels like a natural product and you will want to rub yourself down with it constantly. Your body heat is enough to melt the small pieces, so it&#x27;s easy to just grab one and run it into dry areas without much effort or mess. Best value for Cocoa Butter on Amazon when I purchased it.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great. When I received it I had hoped it would be in shavings or multiple pieces as shown in the photos. Mine came in&lt;br /&gt;2 pieces and in a foil wrapper. Not ziplock, not a jar container. One very large piece and one smaller. It makes it very hard to measure out and even harder to break off. ~Jen</li>
    <li> It works and I&#x27;m going to buy it again. It&#x27;s worth my money. I had this for 3 yrs &amp; it remained solid. Although I didn&#x27;t like that the mail man left it in the sun recently, I started making lipsticks &amp; the cocoa butter really helps it gluide on. The seller was quick &amp; reliable</li>
    <li> Nice that it&#x27;s in chunks so you can weigh out exactly what you need.</li>
    <li> Used this as a base to make some homemade salve.  Wonderful.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice. Never seen raw cocoa butter before. Thanks for the opportunity.</li>
    <li> This is high quality cocoa butter! And the rich chocolate smell is amazing! I used this along with other ingredients to make whipped chocolate body butter and the results were amazing!</li>
    <li> nice product and smells like chocolate ...bought it for making body creme...will buy again</li>
    <li> I use this cocoa butter in my soaps. This has been a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Cocoa butter arrived on time and was as described. Had a great smell. I instantly applied to skin and believe the product will be good in my concoctions..lol</li>
    <li> great seller. I will buy again.</li>
