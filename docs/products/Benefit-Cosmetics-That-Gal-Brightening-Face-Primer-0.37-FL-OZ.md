      <li>i love it its nice product</li>
      <li>Love, Love LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>OK I have been testing out a lot of primers and this is by far the best one for me.</li>
      <li>and I thought it went on very smoothly and brightened my face.</li>
      <li>the more I try to rub it in.</li>
      <li>I love this primer because it feels so lightweight.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I have medium oily skin and this product doesn&#x27;t make me more oily as others do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using a tinted moisturizer now and my skin looks much better without any makeup.</li>
      <li>I  love Benefit cosmetic</li>
      <li>Instead, this feels like a nice, light moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I was immediately hooked and ordered more in order to get my fix.  </li>
      <li>This product is just okay.</li>
      <li>That stuff is magic.</li>
      <li>It mixed perfectly with my foundation.</li>
      <li>Most people think I don&#x27;t wear make up.  </li>
      <li>I really love this stuff and will continue to buy it.  </li>
      <li>I love Benefit&#x27;s That Gal.  </li>
      <li>so I could spend more.</li>
      <li>but this is a fantastic primer!</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>But, to be fair, this isn&#x27;t a foundation, it&#x27;s a primer, and as such it works very nicely.</li>
      <li>I really dont know why there are so many good reviews.  </li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m very expressive and was delighted to see that you couldn&#x27;t see any major wrinkling on my 36 year young face.</li>
      <li>I love Benefit&#x27;s Boing, and I needed something between a primer and a tinted moisturizer, so I thought this would fit the bill.</li>
      <li>This is a quick way to have a healthy, more youthful appearance.</li>
      <li>it isnt really a good primer, which surprised me because i love benefit.</li>
      <li>It is extremely light and does not clog pores.  </li>
      <li>so this helps smooth out my complexion.</li>
      <li>That Gal goes on smoothly and lightly.  </li>
      <li>i love this primer, it seems to be the only primer that actually does not make me break out, leaves my skin smooth, and makes my makeup look flawless.</li>
      <li>My makeup goes on so much better when I apply the primer first.</li>
      <li>The color is pretty, but disappears when you put it on, leaving no coverage or healthy glow.</li>
      <li>It seems to give me a bit more glow that way rather than putting it on first and foundation next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like this as my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; primer (I have 3 or 4 in the drawer).&lt;br /&gt;It gives my skin a nice young glow and holds the foundation well.&lt;br /&gt;Creamy, not a liquid, so don&#x27;t worry about spilling.</li>
      <li>This primer is super light and soaks right in, no pulling, tugging of the face.  </li>
      <li>I have a golden skin tone and the pink didn&#x27;t conflict greatly with it.</li>
      <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t break out at all because of the product, and its super lightweight.</li>
      <li>Favorite for me, though, was that it didn&#x27;t pill up into gunk the way many primers (especially gel based) do on my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other primers and highlighters that are much more effective.</li>
      <li>This product makes my skin feel so smooth, my face does not feel greasy after use and it leaves a pretty glow.</li>
      <li>I love pretty much everything that I have purchased from Benefit.  </li>
      <li>Glad to be able to find this product at a discounted price for the same exact quality you would find from Benefit.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s WELL worth the price</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t interfere with the application of makeup (which is good), and it doesn&#x27;t conflict in any way with any of my other products (toner, serum, moisturizer, SPF).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The texture of this primer is all right when you put it on.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it is not quite right for me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much money at make up stores trying to find a good primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Natural look and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I apply it after my moisturizer every morning and it creates a more even skin tone and overall fresh look.  </li>
      <li>since it really brightens my face and makes me look far more awake and alert than I really am!  </li>
      <li>That Gal works very nicely as a primer, as it doesn&#x27;t have the weird \\&quot;silicone slide\\&quot; sensation that I don&#x27;t care for in most primers.</li>
      <li>Maybe it works better on younger skin (I&#x27;m 38).</li>
      <li>I first discovered Benefit&#x27;s \\&quot;That Gal\\&quot; when I got it as a sample in a cosmetics order.  </li>
      <li>That Gal it gives you nice look smoother and covers the red spot on your face looks so natural.</li>
      <li>Benefit products are always high quality  and worth the money.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>My skin feels fresh and clear every time I use it!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t really tell what it does when I layer it under my makeup.</li>
      <li>It gives it a healthy pink glow.</li>
      <li>I am sure the Benefit primer can work well for others, but for me it is quite pricey and the impact minimal.</li>
      <li>i have yellow/pink toned fair skin, and this makes the pink look red.</li>
      <li>I love Benefit&#x27;s other primer.</li>
      <li>I use this along with Benefit&#x27;s Erase Paste, Benetint on my lips and cheeks and High Beam for a \\&quot;no makeup\\&quot; look.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, but this product has not caused any issues or break-outs.  </li>
      <li>Arrived in sealed packaging and is exactly the same.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I tried Laura M. oil free primer and half way thru my day I needed to use my blotting papers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m to the point where I wash my face with honey because its so sensitive.</li>
      <li>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, it is not particularly good at controlling oil -- by midday, my nose, chin, and forehead are pretty shiny.  </li>
      <li>I can more easliy return it next time but in the mean time I&#x27;ve purchased another illuminator.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that heavy silicone feel like most other primers.  </li>
      <li>I usually wear it alone over my moisturizer, but if I&#x27;m going somewhere special, I might mix it in my palm with my foundation.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it says it brighten your face.  guess what?  surprise, surprise. it does. This primer is super light and soaks right in, no pulling, tugging of the face.  no greasy feeling.  It also lasted well throughout the day.</li>
    <li> i love this primer, it seems to be the only primer that actually does not make me break out, leaves my skin smooth, and makes my makeup look flawless. this makes my makeup stay on all day also. the only thing that i do not like is that you only get .37 oz which is little product. i want to buy this again, but im not sure, i might take a look at another primer just because of the price. but this is a fantastic primer! i love it!</li>
    <li> I have so far only used this by itself and not as an actual primer.  I have Normal/Dry skin and I thought it went on very smoothly and brightened my face.</li>
    <li> This product made virtually no difference, it is rather pink and I am olive skinned so perhaps this is a product for pale skins only: not information they shared at the Benefit counter in Selfridges.  I am now using a silicone based Lancome primer which visibly improves the look of foundation, everything is smoother for longer. I am sure the Benefit primer can work well for others, but for me it is quite pricey and the impact minimal.</li>
    <li> I  love Benefit cosmetic That Gal it gives you nice look smoother and covers the red spot on your face looks so natural. I have been using this and will be the rest of my life. When i wear this i don&#x27;t even have to wear the foundation. Best product ever &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Someone had suggested for me to get this and give it a try to cover up some dark areas on my skin.  but it didnt work for me.  I know some people swear by it and like it so I think it depends on each persons skin and the results they need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely not a big makeup person, but I am big on taking care of my skin.  I adore this product.  I apply it after my moisturizer every morning and it creates a more even skin tone and overall fresh look.  Looking at the color of it, I thought it would make my skin pink, but that is not the case.  I have very sensitive skin, but this product has not caused any issues or break-outs.  It is extremely light and does not clog pores.  I have tried dozens of primers, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch to anything else now that I&#x27;ve found this.  I&#x27;m only unhappy with how small it is and how often I have to re-order!</li>
    <li> If you hate cake-y foundation but want a little coverage and brightness, you will like this.  Does not clog my pores, doesn&#x27;t rub off on collars, and evens out skin tone.  Most people think I don&#x27;t wear make up.  Doesn&#x27;t cake in lines (yikes!), either.</li>
    <li> I first discovered Benefit&#x27;s \\&quot;That Gal\\&quot; when I got it as a sample in a cosmetics order.  I was immediately hooked and ordered more in order to get my fix.  That Gal goes on smoothly and lightly.  Worn under foundation, it doesn&#x27;t get cake-y or heavy, and it brightens the skin so that foundation isn&#x27;t even always necessary.  Yes, it&#x27;s that good.  My skin feels fresh and clear every time I use it!</li>
    <li> Love, Love LOVE this product! Great when added to moisturizer, under makeup or even just alone. Evens out skin tone and keeps foundation in place.</li>
    <li> I like this as my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; primer (I have 3 or 4 in the drawer).&lt;br /&gt;It gives my skin a nice young glow and holds the foundation well.&lt;br /&gt;Creamy, not a liquid, so don&#x27;t worry about spilling.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best primer I have ever used. It makes my skin look and feel wonderful. It gives it a healthy pink glow. My makeup goes on so much better when I apply the primer first. To me, \\&quot;That Gal\\&quot; is a makeup must.</li>
    <li> That Gal works very nicely as a primer, as it doesn&#x27;t have the weird \\&quot;silicone slide\\&quot; sensation that I don&#x27;t care for in most primers. Instead, this feels like a nice, light moisturizer. Mineral makeup goes on very nicely after application. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin tone with this product alone, like some of the other reviewers. But, to be fair, this isn&#x27;t a foundation, it&#x27;s a primer, and as such it works very nicely.</li>
    <li> This is really pink for a primer. I have really fair skin and if I apply this all over my face it just looks like my entire face is blushing. Maybe other people like that, but it&#x27;s not my look. I only use it as a blush now when I contour.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when the lady at the Benefits counter put this on me. I was waiting to get my brows done and thought I was being fed a line of hooey so I could spend more. (Which I was..lol) But she sold me. That stuff is magic. I&#x27;m medium complected and thought it would look weird or chalky. It doesn&#x27;t makes my skin look radiant. I&#x27;m sold..worth the money to me!</li>
    <li> Product is nice - feels good on the face, good to use.  However, I don&#x27;t see a big impact on my look.</li>
    <li> I love Benefit&#x27;s That Gal.  It is a great primer for use under foundation.  It&#x27;s also perfect for the weekends, when I&#x27;m trying to brighten up my \\&quot;no makeup\\&quot; face.    The only drawback is that benefit does not have a program set up for recycling the plastic canisters.  I wish they would set up a program similar to the ones MAC and Kiehl&#x27;s offer.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay. On the plus side: smells good and glides on your face. On the minus sign: I have to apply 2-3 coats to see any results. I will continue using the one i ordered but would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> OK I have been testing out a lot of primers and this is by far the best one for me. I have medium oily skin and this product doesn&#x27;t make me more oily as others do. I tried Laura M. oil free primer and half way thru my day I needed to use my blotting papers. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel so smooth, my face does not feel greasy after use and it leaves a pretty glow. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I use this along with Benefit&#x27;s Erase Paste, Benetint on my lips and cheeks and High Beam for a \\&quot;no makeup\\&quot; look. Yeah, I&#x27;m at that age where I want to wear makeup even while home alone, lol. This is a quick way to have a healthy, more youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> I love Benefit&#x27;s Boing, and I needed something between a primer and a tinted moisturizer, so I thought this would fit the bill. The color is pretty, but disappears when you put it on, leaving no coverage or healthy glow. And it feels greasy and smells weird. Under makeup, it&#x27;s OK, but no better than any other primer.  Maybe it works better on younger skin (I&#x27;m 38). I&#x27;m using a tinted moisturizer now and my skin looks much better without any makeup.</li>
    <li> I really dont know why there are so many good reviews.  This product does nothing.  It&#x27;s like not using a primer at all.  Total waste of money.  I love Benefit&#x27;s other primer.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I have rosasea and very sensitive skin and work excellent and don&#x27;t irritate my skin. Excellent.  The only problem it&#x27;s you can&#x27;t see when you need to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Glad to be able to find this product at a discounted price for the same exact quality you would find from Benefit.  Arrived in sealed packaging and is exactly the same.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The product has a very odd smell and I can&#x27;t really tell what it does when I layer it under my makeup. I&#x27;ve used other primers and highlighters that are much more effective. Too expensive for something that does so little. Sad because the packaging is uber-cute!</li>
    <li> this stupid product of beneft absolutely does nothing ..... I thought it would at least make a great base for my makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;waste of money indeed</li>
    <li> I love this primer because it feels so lightweight. It doesn&#x27;t have that heavy silicone feel like most other primers.  I enjoy applying it because it smells so delicious and gives my skin a nice glow.  Works well under Benefit makeup to make it last.</li>
    <li> The texture of this primer is all right when you put it on.  It doesn&#x27;t interfere with the application of makeup (which is good), and it doesn&#x27;t conflict in any way with any of my other products (toner, serum, moisturizer, SPF).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is not quite right for me.  It has a decidedly pinkish tinge to it and it kind of makes my foundation look a little orange (I&#x27;m very pale so this is noticeable) by comparison.  Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, it is not particularly good at controlling oil -- by midday, my nose, chin, and forehead are pretty shiny.  Also, it has a fragrance, which I would prefer to avoid in a product used on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m undecided on the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; aspects.  I can see how this *might* help with that on someone with a somewhat darker skin tone than I have.  But for now, the only people I&#x27;d recommend this for are those who want to add a pink tone and who don&#x27;t have very oily skin.</li>
    <li> I liked this product a lot.  Natural look and easy to apply. Benefit products are always high quality  and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before but the product that I got from this company lasted only 7 applications. It ran out so I think I was given a partially used tube. I am going to have to purchase another somewhere I can more easliy return it next time but in the mean time I&#x27;ve purchased another illuminator. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Because of the ingredients it has a slight cooling feeling when applied. It&#x27;s a great primer for makeup to even out skin tone. I have pale skin with pink undertones so this helps smooth out my complexion.</li>
    <li> i was given this as a gift, and i dont find it all that impressive. i have yellow/pink toned fair skin, and this makes the pink look red. not attractive. it isnt really a good primer, which surprised me because i love benefit. id skip this and go with smashbox.</li>
    <li> I love pretty much everything that I have purchased from Benefit.  I was on the hunt for a primer and I found this.  I thought it smelled good but it seemed when I would put some on it would start to chalk off (not sure how to explain it).  Not sure if I was putting too much on or what but it was weird and now I don&#x27;t want to use it because it starts to get gross the more I try to rub it in.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by mentioning that my skin refuses everything! I&#x27;m to the point where I wash my face with honey because its so sensitive. I&#x27;ve spent so much money at make up stores trying to find a good primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right before summer started, I was in my local Sephora store when the girl behind the counter was going one about That Gal by Benefit. I just figured she was promoting it because they had an overstock of it. I spent about an hour looking around for my next disappointment (lol) when I finally gave in and tried it. The girl behind the counter kept raving about it, and how well it worked with sensitive skin. I gave in and bought it. That was at the beginning of June. It is now the middle of November. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!! Wow! I use a little every day, and I am still on the same bottle. My skin doesn&#x27;t break out at all because of the product, and its super lightweight. I have rosacea on my cheek and it hasn&#x27;t shown since I started using That Gal. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Silky texture and non-offensive scent. It mixed perfectly with my foundation. I have a golden skin tone and the pink didn&#x27;t conflict greatly with it. At least, not when mixed with my foundation. Also, I&#x27;m very expressive and was delighted to see that you couldn&#x27;t see any major wrinkling on my 36 year young face. Favorite for me, though, was that it didn&#x27;t pill up into gunk the way many primers (especially gel based) do on my skin. I&#x27;ve touched my face multiple times and nothing has moved or rubbed off.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff and will continue to buy it.  I think it&#x27;s WELL worth the price (same price at Ulta) since it really brightens my face and makes me look far more awake and alert than I really am!  It&#x27;s got a really nice pearlescence to it.  I usually wear it alone over my moisturizer, but if I&#x27;m going somewhere special, I might mix it in my palm with my foundation.  It seems to give me a bit more glow that way rather than putting it on first and foundation next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with another reviewer who said that if your skin has an underlying natural tint to it other than pink, then it&#x27;s possible that this product might look unnatural on you (because it IS pink), so think twice about buying this if your skin has a yellowish undertone.  I wish I could recommend a product for those with that undertone...sorry.</li>
    <li> its good u can use it before applying makeup it give shine n smmothness i love it its nice product</li>
