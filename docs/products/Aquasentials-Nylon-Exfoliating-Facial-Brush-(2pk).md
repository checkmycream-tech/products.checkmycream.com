      <li>This brush is soft and has a nice sturdy handle.</li>
      <li>They shipped fast and I love them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very cute and clear brushes. Bristles are perfect not too hard or too soft. My skin is soft again!</li>
    <li> This item is GREAT for traveling. It fits nicely in with your other facial items and doesn&#x27;t take up much room. The bristles are soft so it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. It is also great for at home when you just need that massage action on your face.</li>
    <li> just what I need for my face! I may end up getting a smaller brush with shorter bristles for the around the eyes and nose but this is a great general facebrush. Not too rough</li>
    <li> This brush feels soft on my hands, but on my face it feels a little &amp;#34;rougher,&amp;#34; but that is not a bad think. I don&#x27;t use it everyday but when I do use, I feel like it cleans really well. I used to have a pink brush in a different brand and that one lasted years before it cracked. I wanted something with a girly color, but the clear is actually quite nice. The handle is a very nice length, not too short, plus it has an opening on the end if you want to hang it up. I keep mine in a small bar so the bristles are up and not squashed.</li>
    <li> Love it. After using it twice, I immediately put in another order. Came in a 2 pack so I gave one to my sister. Really like it. It cleans well and dries nicely. My face is so smooth and it feels so clean. Towels and warm water is to rough on my skin. Awesome little brush!</li>
    <li> tried this out as i save up to buy the clarisonic. the brittles are softer than i wanted but for the price, i am ok.</li>
    <li> works! great massage for my face with some Vitamin E oil!</li>
    <li> This brush is soft enough to not be harsh on my skin, but firm enough to exfoliate.  I use it daily and helps keep my skin looking great.</li>
    <li> Good quality, texture and function. A nice bonus of a good cover and two to an order.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the small facial brushes I was buying at Sephora each month (you are supposed to change out your loofahs after a month, I use these in the showers so I figured the same timeline applies). So much cheaper than the other face brushes I&#x27;ve used, comes out to about $2 bucks each!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes have a tiny bit fuller head than my previous travel size brushes with light to medium hardness. Was not sure how these would feel given the low price (was worried about scratchiness) but was pleasantly surprised. I definitely will be buying again.  As they come in a pack of two I was able to use my second one for cleaning (comes in handy when washing grout lines between tiles).  You can also keep the 2nd one for when you need it, they both come with a clear plastic cover to protect the head.</li>
    <li> Bristles are really hard and can be painful for your face, but for neck and body, the long handle is really useful.</li>
    <li> Good brush with comfortable handle. Soft, but not too soft to do the job.</li>
    <li> Very rough brush. It scratched my sensitive skin and caused break outs.</li>
    <li> simple and great tool for the face!</li>
    <li> I had previously ordered a battery operated brush but was not happy with it to gave it away.  Then I found these little brushes and I really love them!!  I keep one on the sink and one in the shower.  They are just the right size for getting into those small areas around the nose.  Too bad I didn&#x27;t buy these before buying the battery operated one. This is far better!!</li>
    <li> Good way to leave your face leaving cleaned but not raw!! I foolishly thought I could pick up a similar one from the Dollar Tree. However it was like washing my face with brillo pad! I will definitely be ordering my brushes from here for now on.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial brush for a deep clean. This brush helps get rid of dead flaky skin. It also allows cleanser to fully penetrate. I wanted a hard bristled brush for my sensitive skin and this is perfect. My skin is clearer and brighter. Sanitize before use and let the brush dry as much as it can before putting the cover back on.</li>
    <li> I do like this product, which I ordered instead of another I was interested in but found it had bad reviews.  This brush is just what I need for exfoliating and is holding up well.  Plus, I like the fact that I got 2 for the price.  It is easy to use, and does the job.</li>
    <li> Nice length, easy to maneuver in my hand.  The bristles are just right - not too stiff, not so soft as to be ineffective.  I ordered four more for my granddaughter and to have on hand!</li>
    <li> Took forever to get and brush is very hard</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little soft for my taste but can&#x27;t be beat for the price and you two.  One to share.</li>
    <li> This brush is soft and has a nice sturdy handle. It cleans my skin wonderfully and rinses clean. Loves it!</li>
    <li> They work very well. They shipped fast and I love them. The only flaw is the cap, I doesn&#x27;t stay on but I don&#x27;t use it anyway.</li>
    <li> The brushes are small, about the length of my hand. The head of the brush is about the size of a silver dollar. The bristles are extremely soft, but they work nice to clean your face gently. If you have black or white heads, they are wonderful. They got rid of mind almost instantly, and left my skin soft and shiny. However, if you have an extreme breakout, I would suggest getting a brush with stiffer bristles. These are softer than your average bristled hairbrush or toothbrush, if that gives you an idea. It&#x27;s definitely worth the cheap price, so if you&#x27;re in need of something it&#x27;s worth a shot. I gave four stars only because of how soft the bristles are, and because they cap they come in isn&#x27;t ventilated so you have to dry the brush first. Both brushes were separately packaged. I will probably buy again when these wear out.</li>
    <li> Way to soft to do any exfoliating</li>
    <li> Fell apart during first use. The tufts of bristles literally came out. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Rather stiff too for a face brush.</li>
    <li> This brush does the job for exfoliating and leaving you feeling clean. However, the brush is very harsh-- it actually kind of hurts to use! Much more rough than similar brushes you can buy at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> Good brush, firm but not too rough. Seems to have helped my face so far</li>
    <li> I have used this brush for a couple of weeks now and love it, it cleans so much better than a cloth. I have acne-prone skin and have found a big improvement since switching to the brush and using a tea tree oil facial cleanser. I also liked the fact that there are two brushes in this package, and at a good price. I highly recommend this product to everyone, and especially to anyone who has skin problems.</li>
    <li> Worked great for about 6 months then fell apart. But for the price...easily worth it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. My partner and I love exfoliating on a daily basis and these seem less invasive as the electric exfoliating brushes you find for 100+ dollars online and in store.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush to replace the electric Clarisonic brush I was using ... feeling this to be &#x27;organic&#x27; ... or natural; Instead of a motorized brush exfoliating my skin, I now use this brush in circular fashion all around my face. I was able to download instructions on how to use online, which helped since I do not know anyone in person who uses a face brush. I am still learning how to do this skill with ease because the electric Clarisonic brush was easier. Still, I am eager to continue getting better at it myself and &#x27;chucking&#x27; the appliance. I have found this face brush to exfoliate whether I use it &#x27;dry&#x27; (without water) or in the shower. I recommend the instructions noted here -&gt; [...] ... although I do not recommend the face brush advertised on this website. Good luck!  :)</li>
    <li> not hard to keep clean, make sure u let it dry before putting the cap back on. i use it everyday. its not hard but hard enough to clean and exfoliate your face.</li>
    <li> The brushes appear to be of good quality.  The bristles have a great level of firmness to them, many brushes are so whimpy they don&#x27;t do anything at all. The brushes also each come with a cap to cover the bristles, which seem rather pointless and annoying to use. As a side note, I have found that Earth Therapuetics Hydro Exfoliating Gloves are much better than scrub brushes, but these brushes are a good option as well.</li>
    <li> Supersoft bristles perfect for face!</li>
    <li> They feel soft on your skin, but really clean and exfoliate well. I leave the cover off to let the brush dry and the bristles don&#x27;t get mashed up.</li>
    <li> Yep...love it for the cleansing power...</li>
    <li> I got these for vacation because I didn&#x27;t want to take my clarisonic along. These are very nice. A little softer than im use to but are a great alternative to an electric brush. And way cheaper. I would recommend it to anyone not wanting to spend the money on a clarisonic or other expensive face brushes.  I use my philosophy purity one step with it with excellent results.  Skin feels soft and clean with this brush. My husband likes using these before shaving to exfoliate his face.</li>
    <li> I consider this brush set to be a real value. It seems to be a reasonably well made brush and I like the stiffness of the bristle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used my brush for a couple of weeks and I can only recall seeing one of the fibers come out.&lt;br /&gt;I gave the second brush to my mom and she really likes it as well. This is her first introduction to a face brush.</li>
    <li> quality, and the bristle area is good for around the eyes and behind and around the ears. Bristles are just the right stiffness with out being to ruff on the skin. good price also.</li>
    <li> I needed a scrub brush for my face that was strong enough to clear off all of the make up and oil but still soft on my skin. This brush fits the bill. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and really gets my face clean. Note that the bristles aren&#x27;t super soft. I&#x27;d say they were just a step above soft.</li>
    <li> I love to wash my make up off with this brush my face feels so clean. The brush then just rinses off clean . It&#x27;s made of hard plastic very sturdy brisles are soft and works well on your face skin</li>
    <li> I ordered these facial brushes to use on my face when washing. I keep one in the shower and one by the sink for easy access. The bristles are just right, not to rough but not to soft. The size is actually perfect even though I was under the impression they were bigger going by the picture. But it worked out for me! I suggest these to anyone who wants a great facial brush fora great price that works great!</li>
    <li> Perfect and glad that it came two in an order</li>
    <li> Great Product, Would buy again</li>
    <li> i feel that its to soft for me ...using it daily alond with DUDU-OSUN as a facial cleaner before shaving</li>
    <li> Great little brushes, super soft!</li>
    <li> This brush worked well, but i found the same thing at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a exfoliating facial brush with plastic bristles (natural bristles get moldy). This one is literally perfect, I fell in love with it. The bristles are soft but if you exfoliate in small light circles, you feel that the ends of the bristles are rough enough. I&#x27;m very clumsy and was afraid of it breaking, from me dropping it, but I dropped it many times in the shower and it&#x27;s still in great condition. Overall, very satisfied with this product and possibly ordering more. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Good brushes but long waitt.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great! I see these selling for twice the price! It even has a cap, which I was pleasantly surprised to see! This is my first face brush- and it was odd! It wasn&#x27;t as exfoliating as I thought, but when I looked in the mirror an hour later I had dry patches! Need more time to see if this helps acne!</li>
    <li> Good brushes,,  like the little cover for them....fast delivery...would buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on one of those electric facial brushes; these manual brushes work the same at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have mentioned in their reviews that the nylon bristles are too harsh for their skin. I&#x27;d like to note that the bristles soften and become gentle and pliable in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing my face once a day in a gentle, circular motion with this brush (using my all natural Nubian Heritage black soap &amp;#60;-- this soap rules) has significantly reduced my blackhead problem and therefore, shrunk down my pores. I also get hormonal monthly breakouts, and since I&#x27;ve started using this brush at night to wash my face, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since. The brush is so cheap, and comes two to a pack, so you really have nothing to lose if you&#x27;re on the fence about trying it out. Personally, this is replacing my daily exfoliator. Love it!</li>
    <li> I like these better than battery operated brushes. Makes my skin feel so much smoother and its alot cheaper and easier to clean.  Brushes are soft but not to soft.  You can feel the bristles massaging your skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to exfoliate your skin I use this to exfoliate my body and it&#x27;s been working well, I will be buying this again in a few months</li>
    <li> I checked all the review before I bought it, However, when I received it, I am a little disappointed, it is not soft as I thought</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this brush.  After having used apricot scrub for at least 25 years, I recently came to realize that my aging skin could no longer tolerate it.  I&#x27;m 58 years old, and have had horrible skin since puberty.  I have two massive craters on my forehead that used to be pores.  The rest of my pores on my t-zone are huge and fill with thick sebum.  GROSS!  Using this brush instead of apricot scrub is making an improvement to my skin which is now less irritated.  My skin will continue to be bad, but the brush is beneficial.  I&#x27;m using it with Dove bar soap.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I have been using them for about a year now and can say my skin looks better than it has in years!!  My pours look smaller, less breakouts, even tone. Just use it with any facewash in the shower.</li>
    <li> I found this brush much too abrasive.  I was looking for something that would do a good job of exfoliating, and for that I wanted fairly stiff bristles.  However, the stiffness of the bristles on this brush coupled with the fact that the bristles are all of varying lengths makes the brush too irritating for my face; the longer bristles consistently scratch my skin.  I suspect the differing lengths of the bristles was unintentional and is just the result of the poor quality of the brush.  Surprisingly, I have found better face brushes at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> So far I really like the softness of this brush. I made sure to properly wash and disinfect this brush. One of the brush removable covers was cracked so it should have had thicker bubble wrapping. But all in all what I was looking for.  __ Update, small hair line cracks have destroyed these brushes and are now useless.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive way for me to start dry brushing my face.  I had just started dry brushing my body and really loved the effect it was having on my skin.  So, I purchased these to start that regiment.  My facial skin is quite sensitive and the bristles seemed soft enough but I had an allergy type reaction to the bristles and I see all scratches on my face.  I only dry brushed a total of 30 seconds max.  So, these brushes obviously are NOT going to work for me.  I have since purchased a more expensive &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bristle face brush with no adverse reactions.  I will use these for a different purpose I guess, like my nails.  I gave two stars because at least the shipping was quick..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too hurt on my face.</li>
    <li> The brush is very rough and too abrasive to use on my face.  Shipping took weeks.  I would not buy these again.</li>
    <li> Use this brush with black soap each morning.  Makes my face happy.</li>
    <li> It took a long time to receive (shipping), but great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been body brushing, but found that brush was way too large for my face. These are a great price and come in a two pack. The other reviewer who said it is too big must have had a shipment error. The ones I received are definitely small. I have sensitive skin and these are fine (I only dry brush). I like the idea of the cap, but it is nearly flush to the bristle edge when putting it on. So not every little bristle gets tucked into the cap properly, which could bend the bristles the wrong way. Not a big deal though, I&#x27;m just not using the caps. If I travel I will use them.</li>
    <li> This is a great exfoliating brush and is well made. I recommend buying this brush.</li>
    <li> Item as described.  Will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> A great facial brush!  My husband uses them to wash his face but I like them too.  The bristles are soft so they don&#x27;t scrub your skin raw but they do a great job!  They were delivered really fast too!</li>
    <li> I bought the facial brush expecting the product to cleanse my face and it didn&#x27;t. I have fair/sensitive skin and all the brush did was scratch my skin and made it irritated and red.  I thought by warming the bristles with warm water that it would soften, but that didn&#x27;t happen. The brush is more for the rough parts of the body like elbows and knees or feet, just not for the face. This is definitely NOT for people with sensitive skin. Buyer beware, this product will hurt!</li>
    <li> Kind of small, a little too soft, but overall good</li>
    <li> Product gets 5 stars, but experience gets 0 stars. I got the right product. It was exactly what I wanted. I haven&#x27;t been able to find these in over 10 years. However, after ordering, some how, I had 2 unauthorized purchases made on my card. One for $.86 from NY and the other for $92 from France.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he searched everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find a cheap facial brush. This was not only cheap, but it comes as a two-pack! IT is not a hard brush, rather soft but firm. Great to use with facial wash.</li>
    <li> Decent facial brushes are so hard to find.  I like this brush, and I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 packs of 2. It exfoliates well but it is a bit abrasive on my delicate eye area.  If you have sensitive skin, you might find that this brush is too abrasive no matter where you use it.  Heating the bristles with hot water will soften them, and using light pressure helps.  The head is oval shaped as opposed to round and is about 1&amp;#34; in diameter. The handle has a hang hole.  Unfortunately, the caps cracked as soon as I tried to place them back on the heads, but I won&#x27;t be using them anyway since the caps are not ventilated and I like my brushes to thoroughly air dry.  These were sold by Aquasentials and fulfilled by Amazon.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> Great little face brush.  What&#x27;s not to like.  Soft on your face, but cleans well.</li>
    <li> Great product! Secure caps, simple to clean and store, fabulous price! I LOVE these brushes for the treatment room, thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This is misrepresented. I purchased this through Amazon and received what I would describe as body brushes or back scrubbers (but they look just like the picture).  If I were to use these on my face I&#x27;d likely rip the skin off.  I contacted Amazon to return this but got very annoyed with the whole process. Given the price of this item I can&#x27;t see printing off a UPS return label and then driving 40 mins round trip to drop it off at the nearest facility.  At almost $4 a gallon for gas, it is not even worth the aggravation. Save yourself a headache and buy a \\&quot;facial\\&quot; brush from another vendor. As for me, I might use these to clean my tires.</li>
    <li> I bought a wonderful facial brush at Sephora a few years ago but lost it. This one is not as soft.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel very clean. Might be a little hard for everyone, but it was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before from the dollar store and the bristles were soft and gentle enough for my skin. The bristles on this one were quite hard and rough on my skin. (Face).</li>
    <li> product could be better</li>
    <li> i love those brushes. it cleans my face so well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an exfoliating brush for years, and I think most other guys should do the same. You can hide it from everyone, of course. That&#x27;s what I do. I don&#x27;t want anyone to think I&#x27;m a girl. My beard probably takes care of that problem, but you never know. Somebody might think you&#x27;re a bearded lady if they catch you with an exfoliating brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, these Aquasentials are the best for the money I&#x27;ve ever bought. The brushes are heavy and tough, and soft. I feel sure you&#x27;ll like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerning soap, I don&#x27;t buy exfoliating soap. That&#x27;s just something else to hide from people who might think you&#x27;re a bearded lady. I mix a teaspoon of Green soap in the palm of my hand and add a teaspoon of sugar. This is much less expensive than exfoliating soaps you&#x27;ll find in stores, and it works much better.</li>
    <li> Really soft brush that&#x27;s sturdy enough to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Good face brush. Bristol are a little harder than what I wanted,  but not hard enough that you can&#x27;t use the .</li>
    <li> The brustles are soft but are rough on your face which is great so it exfoliates. Left face very smooth and  was great priced. Delivered very quickly. Overall great product. (Dont put hot water on it cold or cool is fine)</li>
    <li> This face brush was everything I hoped it would be! The bristles are soft but they still leave my face feeling adequately exfoliated. I have been looking for a replacement face brush since I lost my last one, and this one was perfect!</li>
    <li> Sometimes you purchase products that in no way perform what they say, but this product is EXACTLY what I was looking for! A simple exfoliating brush you can manually soothe all over your face and/or body! I LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t stiff enough to exfoliate deep enough. Its kind of like washing your face with a small baby brush.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of brush for years then couldn&#x27;t find them at Walmart no more. Found these cheaper here than Walmart. I&#x27;m a home health nurse and I brought one these for my one of my patients who is getting acne from hormonal changes. What a difference to his face!! LOVE LOVE these!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the face instead a simple towel</li>
    <li> Great price for a nice product.</li>
    <li> Brush is great - cap is useless.  Not a problem, though.</li>
