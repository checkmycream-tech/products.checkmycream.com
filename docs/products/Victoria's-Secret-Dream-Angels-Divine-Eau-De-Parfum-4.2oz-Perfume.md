      <li>So happy I was able to find my favorite discontinued perfume here!</li>
      <li>but soo glad I was able to find this!!</li>
      <li>I am so in love with this perfume that I pushed my luck again and ordered ONE (no way I&#x27;d go for three again!)</li>
      <li>This time I can tell that the alcohol content is higher because it stings my skin when I put it on, but hey, a girl has gotta pay a price for beauty sometimes!!!!</li>
      <li>I get compliments from Doctors &amp; shop keepers- Very light clean spray!!</li>
      <li>My favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I can;t get this a store any more.</li>
      <li>Love this scent... ❤❤</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume....</li>
      <li>I always love this parfum</li>
      <li>I like it it, but it is definately not  as strong as when i bought it at VS.  </li>
      <li>This does not smell like the original perfume</li>
      <li>Amazing thank you so much you have a customer for life ;)!</li>
      <li>However, the bottle I received was like the first three I had ordered from this supplier: not the original scent, and silver neck and spray tip.</li>
      <li>Got a compliment the first day I wore it again!</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this perfume for about 13 years but V.S. discontinued it so now I order it from Amazon ;)</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and cant get it locally</li>
      <li>Super excited it&#x27;s back</li>
      <li>The coloring on the top piece of the bottle neck, as well as the spray tip, were silver whereas those two pieces were pink on the bottle I had from the VS store.</li>
      <li>When I received those three bottles, I realized that the scent was a little off; again, not bad but just not quite right.</li>
      <li>Personally, I think the fragrance is a litte stronger scent than the ones she purchased from Victoria Secret, but if she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich</li>
      <li>Maybe it is old or nit the real deal, not sure.</li>

    <li> My favorite perfume. I was so sad when VS stopped carrying it but soo glad I was able to find this!!</li>
    <li> My wife says it is not quite the same but she still likes this fragrance and she is happy I found it on Amazon. Personally, I think the fragrance is a litte stronger scent than the ones she purchased from Victoria Secret, but if she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich</li>

    <li> Beware: this is NOT the same scent that used to be sold in the Victoria&#x27;s Secret stores...not bad, but just not the same as the original. I have been wearing this perfume for practically a decade, and was extremely disappointed when I discovered that it had been discontinued by Victoria&#x27;s Secret. Found it on Amazon and was so desperate to not be without it that I purchased three bottles. When I received those three bottles, I realized that the scent was a little off; again, not bad but just not quite right. I compared these bottles with one I had purchased previously from the VS store. The coloring on the top piece of the bottle neck, as well as the spray tip, were silver whereas those two pieces were pink on the bottle I had from the VS store. The item was not authorized for return, but Amazon refunded me without question (thank you, Amazon). I am so in love with this perfume that I pushed my luck again and ordered ONE (no way I&#x27;d go for three again!) bottle from a different supplier. I ensured the picture had the correct coloring on the bottle in case that was an actual indicator of what would be the off-scent product. However, the bottle I received was like the first three I had ordered from this supplier: not the original scent, and silver neck and spray tip. I&#x27;m not dumb enough to try a third time, so I suppose I&#x27;ll just have to come to terms with the fact that this scent is no more. Sad face. :(</li>
    <li> I like it it, but it is definately not  as strong as when i bought it at VS.  Maybe it is old or nit the real deal, not sure. Would not buy again.</li>

    <li> I have worn this perfume for over a decade and was upset when vicoria secret discontinued it.  I was happy I could find it online.</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manor and saved money.</li>
    <li> I always loved this and was so disappointed when it was discontinued. Super excited it&#x27;s back and I found it cheaper on amazon!!</li>
    <li> So happy I was able to find my favorite discontinued perfume here!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.... why was it discontinued!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent, met with my wife&#x27;s expectation.</li>
    <li> Should have brought #3 bottle you can no longer buy this product at Victoria Secrets😍</li>
    <li> I get a complaint everyday I wear this, women and men. :-)</li>
    <li> Great shipping, wife loves the smell.  What else can i say?</li>
