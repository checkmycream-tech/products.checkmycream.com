<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> ..good product......&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for all....</li>
    <li> I use my straighteners for curling as well---except for this one. Since it is wide and very flat, the curls come out a little creased and flat. I also have a hard time because my hair gets stuck in the plastic part surrounding the iron section. Maybe more skilled curlers have better luck. It does straighten nicely and heats up quickly, while not heating the plastic part. I have never burned myself on this iron.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite straightener I&#x27;ve owned since they first &amp;#34;came out&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve probably had three, but I keep coming back.</li>
    <li> This straightener is the BEST! I had one for the past 4 years, I dropped it on the cement and it broke, so there was NO doubt that I wouldn&#x27;t get the same exact straightener. It smooths my hair, makes it so straight. The heat temps are perfect, and there&#x27;s this neat little comb type thing at the end that helps straighten evenly. You will NOT be dissappointed with this straightener.</li>
    <li> My mother decided to get a flat iron and picked up this one. She had used it a few times and didn&#x27;t like it. She said it was really weak and tugged her hair.  One day I used the straightener because I had left mine at a friends house. At its highest setting, I could barely feel the heat. Once I used it, my hair got torn and stuck in the corner by the temperature control. If you zoom, you can actually see where the straightener splits down the middle.  It is a waste of money and time, I absolutely hate it. I myself own an HAI straightener and although it is pricey, I have had it for 6 years and I still use it almost everyday.  As for this straightener, Conair should remove it off shelves. Unless you want to deal with your hair being pulled out and split ends, don&#x27;t pay a dime for this!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product...and i had a bad expereince, i was so exited that i found it cus i was looking for this straightner... i was happy when i received it but the most heart breaking part was this.... when i was trying to turn it on.....it wasn&#x27;t working...i was very upset....Now i just wanna know that how i can trust if i wanna purchase something online...</li>
    <li> I previously had this same straightener in black and it lasted for years.  When it finally gave out I had to buy the same one and it works amazingly.  I would recommend it to anyone.  The comb attached is a great feature.  The shipping was fast and I had no issues with my order</li>
    <li> I have had Conair straighteners before and this one does not really do it. Does not close all the way and really does not get hot enough. I have very course curly hair and this does not work</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter.  She was very pleased with it.  Since it was a gift I can only go by her reactions.</li>
    <li> This review isn&#x27;t about the product itself it&#x27;s a review of TOY RANCH.  The seller. They sent the incorrect item &amp; it wasn&#x27;t even packaged appropriately.  The item itself was not padded in the boys &amp; easily damaged without proper precautions utilized.  don&#x27;t use TOY RANCH.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair, not even curly, but I&#x27;ve found this straightner hardly gets anything out. I have to go over each section of hair four or five times for it to actually straighten, and then it&#x27;s frizzy. It&#x27;s especially bad on bedhead. I was very disappointed and now I&#x27;m pissed because I just can&#x27;t stand it. It&#x27;s like a toy one. I think combing my hair does more than using this straightner. And it takes forever to make your hair even a little bit straight. There are many that are the same price and work better.</li>
    <li> I hate this straightner it gets hot but I threw it away because I got so tired of it pulling my hair. This straightner pulls my hair out and then is stuck between the plate and the handle.</li>
    <li> Love it but had to pop off the comb thing it came with. It pulled my hair. Works great and i love the color.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, thinking that if one broke, I could have a back-up.  But when I opened one of them, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t quite close all the way.  I consider this to be a defect, so I decided to send the unopened one back.  The original straightener I had is the sister of this one, I would guess, because is was # CS25.  That one was black, with the ironing part being purple metal, and it looked more like something a professional would use.  It was really special.  This one looks generic and I consider it a down-grade from the CS25.  Since I&#x27;m on a budget right now, I couldn&#x27;t afford the price of $47 that it listed for that one, and so that&#x27;s why I got this one instead.  It does the work that I require.  But the problem I have is that since it does not close all the way, I have to press it really hard.  That really hurts my hands, and I have to take little brakes in between to rest my hands, which then requires more time to straighten my hair.  It could very well be that I got this one like that, and others may not have this defect, but since this is what I got, I give it 3 stars because of that...</li>
    <li> The straightener as a whole felt a little cheap, but hey, it was. I really liked the comb attachment though.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair straightener, and you can&#x27;t buy it in stores anymore! I love the little detachable comb on it. This way I don&#x27;t have to hold a brush or comb in one hand to pull my hair straight while using the iron. I was thrilled to be able to find it on Amazon. :-) The one downfall is that it really only seems to last for about 1-2 yrs before the plates start to deteriorate and stop getting to its maximum heat. For the price, I can handle that. It may not get quite as hot as some of the more expensive straighteners out there, but I will keep buying this model until I really can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in red, it came in black. It was a Christmas gift, i am not happy they messed up the color.</li>
    <li> I wanted a really good hair straightner, but could not find one with great reviews, but this one seemed to have good reviews and a good price, so I tried it. It straightens my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t stay straight all day long, even with product. I do like that it shuts off by itself though, I&#x27;m pretty forgetful. :( Also, the comb only tugs your hair if you use it a certain way. I have pretty thin, curly, frizzy hair, and would not recommend this for someone with thick hair. I don&#x27;t use too much heat, because my hair is already pretty dry, I don&#x27;t want to dry it out too bad, this could be why it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for years. It survived everything from being dropped to being shoved in a bag and mistreated by baggage handlers at the airport. I have extremely thick course hair, but this straightener made it feel like silk and I was constantly complimented on how shiny my hair was. Sadly it finally broke after at least 3 years of daily use and abuse. Needless to say, I&#x27;m planning on buying another one ASAP.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener as a back up. I currently have the same one and I am deathly afraid it will die on me and I can&#x27;t seem to find it in the stores anymore. It is described as &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; but in fact it is a plum kind of color - which doesn&#x27;t matter at all to me. I like that it has a comb to guide the hair - especially since my hair is curly. best if used on dry hair - only have to go over it 2x and I have long, thick, curly hair. It gets nice and hot but doesn&#x27;t damage your hair. I think it is a great product. Maybe i will buy another backup for my backup - just in case!</li>
    <li> NOT A GOOD BUY SHIPPING BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE... I SENT FOR NEW AND WAS SENT REFURBISHED... I DOESN&#x27;T WORK!!!</li>
    <li> i am used to using the old flat irons, the kind you put on the stove.  i am black and kind of scared about using these types of straightener.  but amazingly it does work pretty good and i like the fact that i can actually feel the heat, meaning i know its working well.  i dont like the comb part though, it seems to pull out a bit.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite straightener.  my 2nd purchase of the same.  I have tried other brands/styles, but this is my flat iron of choice.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> Mine broke and I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, so I bought another brand.  After burning myself badly on the new one, I renewed my search to find a replacement of my old one.  I am soooo glad to have it back!  I LOVE, LOVE the comb too!</li>
    <li> I had one of these before and could not find it locally.  I was so glad I could get it online.</li>
    <li> This straightener is great, especially given the price! I&#x27;m particular to thinner straighteners, and so it took me a little time to adjust to how wide this straightener is in comparison to my older one. However, it heats up exceptionally fast and has a great comb to ensure that your hair is being evenly straightened (the comb is a little flimsy so just be careful about this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener&#x27;s heat increases with a dial, which I almost always leave at the highest point. I&#x27;ve tried straightening with a lower heat, but I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with how straight it looks unless it&#x27;s on the absolutely highest setting. I have fairly standard Asian hair, leaning towards the thicker side, so I was hoping that I would not have to use as high a heat to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, it&#x27;s great if you are looking for a cheap straightener to use daily or on a regular basis! There are better ones out there, but it&#x27;s doubtful to find one at as good a price as this!</li>
    <li> sent back - too big for traveling with.  If you have thick curly hair I would suggest getting as the small travel size will not work for you - but this one will</li>
    <li> I had one for over 2 years and then it just stopped working. I went out and spend ridiculous $$ on a similar one it but in the end it was nothing like it at all. I decided to look for this one and to my lucky stars it was still available. Used it this morning and like coming home! Never dries my hair and always leaves it silly smooth looking. Highly recommend this hair straightener.</li>
    <li> There is a weird comb thing on one side that sometimes pulls my hair a little that&#x27;s my only complaint.... it gets very hot and works well on my hair!</li>
    <li> I cannot figure out why, but this straightener pulls and/or rips out hair every time I pull it through.  I have an Andis brand straightener, and have used other straighteners and have never had this problem.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if I have the comb piece in or out of the straightener, the result is the same-ouch!  The best I can figure is that somehow a few hairs get caught on the ends of the plates, but I don&#x27;t know why.  It looks harmless but obviously is not.  I have tried using it several times thinking I must be doing something wrong, but how can you do \\&quot;something wrong\\&quot; with a tool as simple as a straightener?!  I&#x27;ve given up on this straightener to save my hair from being tortured.</li>
    <li> Dodn&#x27;t use all the time but works well</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because it was a dual voltage.  I wanted to use it on Scotland on my vacation.  It DID NOT WORK.  All of my other electronic devices, including a dual voltage hair dryer I had, worked fine.  But thus WILL NOT WORK in Europe!  It is falsely advertised as dual voltage.  I want my money back!!!!!</li>
    <li> Light weight, easy to clear, and heats very fast. I had the older model, and when it stopped working, I looked for its replacement. I found it, and I am please many improvements were made. Only has teeth on on side now, but works just as well.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron the best JUST BECAUSE of the comb attachment!  It makes my hair look naturally straight.  I would say it&#x27;s a little above average reliable b/c it seems like my flat irons last me about 1 year (I straighten my hair everyday).  I&#x27;ve been through a couple of this particular model and they&#x27;ve lasted me around 18 months but they come with a 24 month warranty.</li>
    <li> Wide body with a small comb on one side. This was purchased as a gift and was greatly liked and appreciated.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron I ever had! Was so excited that I finally found them on Amazon after years of searching.</li>
    <li> this heats up well and straightens your hair as its supposed to but it constantly is pulling one or two hair out with every stroke of the straightener because they get caught in something.  i have another straightener where that never happens</li>
    <li> bought this for my sis cheap quality and broke less than a week theres better for same price yup yup</li>
    <li> Its&#x27; a wonderful product for such a cheap price. It works great for males and females alike. It doesn&#x27;t take long to get to the appropriate temperature either.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old conair  hair straightener that I had owned for 10 years when it finally wouldn&#x27;t work anymore I thought I would replace it with another conair since I liked the other one so much and it lasted me so long. Well this one worked really well for about 2 months then it just stopped working. It wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all. I feel I wasted my money and I would not recommend this hair straighter  unless you want one that is only going to work for a short time.</li>
    <li> bought this thinking it was going to be amazing, unfortunately it is not, the price was thou. My husband bought a  better one he couldnt stand my complaining.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s what I wanted but missing the comb. had to send back. I will order again . I hope that the comb comes with the next one I order</li>
    <li> Not for my hair type. Didn&#x27;t get my hair straight.</li>
    <li> heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t catch/pull my hair.  I&#x27;d recommend it. It&#x27;s also light weight.  The detachable comb is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose but within a month it&#x27;s already catching on my hair due to a crack in the cheap plastic casing.</li>
    <li> it worked okay for me maybe I needed to keep doing it thought my hair would be straight and thin, my hair texture has changed from straight and flowing nicely to thick, very wavy, when you comb or brush I get thicker and wilder so I ill try this again and see what happens tired of wearing my hair in a ponytail or braiding it</li>
    <li> There is a Conair flat iron that I owned previously that went up to a 38 dial.  That is what I thought I had ordered.  This one goes up to a 25 dial.  My hair is soft and wavy.  This iron gives a straight appearance with a bounce, but not a dead straight appearance which the flat iron that goes up to the 38 setting does.  This is light weight and is pretty okay.  But if you have curly or course hair, this is not the flat iron for you.</li>
    <li> The people that say it wasn&#x27;t worth the money need to remember it was 12 dollars!!!!!! I personally love it and it works great on very thick hair!</li>
    <li> good straightener for the price.doesnt get too hot and my hair comes out fine.&lt;br /&gt; will try a bigger size next time</li>
    <li> This straightener doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten wavy hair. Although I do like it for my younger daughter to get practice using it.</li>
    <li> Purchased specifically for travel abroad. Lightweight and compact. Fine for large sections of hair, but may not work for small sections or thin hair as it does not close tightly.</li>
    <li> Got plenty hot enough for my curly thick hair. Used while traveling to europe.&lt;br /&gt;Only 1 minor niggle....the plates dont come together very tightly when gripping with 1 hand.&lt;br /&gt;mitigated by either using both hands or flip it backwards. Worked great that way.&lt;br /&gt;Was lightweight for luggage and cheap. Overall very happy with it for the purpose.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of this straightener. The first one I had lasted me 5 years! No joke! And I used it at least a couple times a week (typically more). I love that you can detach the little comb on the side but I personally like using it. I have long hair but this straightens my hair pretty quick!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it does not heat up as much as it should and I would like to return it.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a year, but now it&#x27;s broken.  The lights blink, but it never gets hot.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift so can&#x27;t say how it works. I will give my daughter the option of returning after she receives it.  I was real disappointed that it was NOT packaged in a box.  When purchasing a gift it certainly would be nice to have it in a box for presentation.  It looks new but the way it came I am not at all certain.  The  power cord was just hanging loose not bundeled up.  At this time this is all that I can say.  Because I have to rate I have rated at this time as I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this hair straightener for over 4 years now and still hasn&#x27;t died on me. It does well straightening my hair, though it takes a few pass throughs to get the job done. After a year (if that)  of owning the thing, the dial that changes the heat broke. All it does is spin without changing the heat. The comb that attaches to the side slides out while using it, so it becomes a hassle. But for my long, wavy hair it does the job. And for owning the straightener for about 4 years, it&#x27;s lasted and the performance hasn&#x27;t suffered in its old age. I just wish it was a bit more durable.</li>
    <li> Wife didn&#x27;t like much because you can&#x27;t straighten hair as much with the little attached comb it brings</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all for minimal packaging but we Bought this as a gift and it came loose in a plastic bag.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my 12 year old niece and she seems to like it. Was happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. It was very reasonably priced, shipped quickly, and she loved it. Works great on her long thick hair.</li>
    <li> i read all the reviews and thought i found a deal! this iron will work perfect for pin straight and paper thin hair! do not buy if you dont have this kind of hair!</li>
    <li> I have owned at LEAST six of these straighteners and they are truly wonderful...until they ALL break for no reason. Usually between 6 months and one year of age, they all just stop heating up. I usually took advantage of Conair&#x27;s two year warranty (save those receipts!) since they send you a new one for less than $15 when you return the old one. However, my last one just broke this morning and I&#x27;m frustrated. I&#x27;m switching to Remington--at least they make reliable straighteners! Please do not buy Conair! They&#x27;re cheap and stop heating!!!!</li>
    <li> I actually used to have the black and purple one but that one broke and then I could never find it again...found it on here and got totally excited! I love this one better than the expensive flat irons only because of the comb...it separates my hair evenly and makes it look shiny and silky. I did however, have a problem with how it was shipped. It did not come in it&#x27;s own &amp;#34;company&amp;#34; box. It just came in a plastic bag inside an amazon.com box. I was very disappointed in that. Who knows if it would&#x27;ve still worked after all that banging around in that box...but thankfully it works and I didn&#x27;t have to send it back. That&#x27;s really all that I have to complain about. :)</li>
    <li> Great size; others are too long for me to work with. It also works well on my thick, partially straight hair.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, it works great! Very inexpensive and it heats up just enough for my hair to be straightened.</li>
    <li> I wish that I had gotten one sooner!  This is easier to use than I thought it would be.  I heard that the ceramic ones are better, so that is why I got this one.</li>
    <li> The comb thing attached rips out my hair.. I took it off and it&#x27;s better but the plates don&#x27;t close together evenly.. I&#x27;ve kept it but I don&#x27;t like to use it.</li>
    <li> I used to have the black and purple one and it broke and ive been searching for it in stores but couldn&#x27;t find it but good thing I found it here cuz I really love this straightner leaves the hair so soft and silky &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> It worked great the first couple times I used it, but by the fifth time I used it it didn&#x27;t even heat up very much anymore and wouldn&#x27;t even smooth out my hair. I don&#x27;t recommend wasting your time or money on this.</li>
    <li> This straightener was okay. I used it for 4weeks but it didn&#x27;t seem to straighten for too long so I bough a new one.</li>
    <li> Not the best, but definitely better than most. This I had to buy because my regular one stopped working. Great back up, though.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a while now, have no complaints works great, fast to heat up and does the job to straighten my hair!</li>
    <li> I have had many, many hair straighters.&lt;br /&gt;I open my box that was sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;&amp; Used it for 7 minutes and my hair was done!&lt;br /&gt;I read many other comments on product some were neg. But, still i wanted it and glad i did</li>
    <li> We have one straightner in the house with 3 girls. So I bought this one. It works great and now they fight for this one</li>
    <li> It is awesome! Just what I was looking for and exactly what I expected! I had been looking in all the stores around town for one of these and none of them sold them. I had bought one years ago and loved it so much and it had finally died. I was so unhappy with all the ones I kept buying, all I wanted was this conair straightener. I looked online finally and there it was! I was so excited!!!!</li>
    <li> love this straightener ..my old one finally gave up.. searched hi and low and finally ordered one...fast shipping.. product as described</li>
    <li> Hmmm. It works. Seventeen more words... Should I talk about why I hate my curly hair? Or should I write about the American Genome Project and why I have curly hair in the first place?</li>
    <li> Easy to use and carry it every where I like. shipment Excellent :)&lt;br /&gt;Works great so far. Used it many times.</li>
    <li> This is a good product with a great price. I bought this for my cousin and it does everything she need.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. Hard to find. They are very durable.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I&#x27;ve had it for about 4 or 5 years and it still works extremely well. The only problem is that I seem to have misplaced the comb. Does anyone know where I can find a replacement?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Kristen</li>
    <li> this item is very portable and leaves my hair nice, is not heavy to use and results are very durable...</li>
    <li> When you use it, it rips your hair out. After about five minutes of being on the heat goes down by itself. Biggest piece of crap ever. Your better off just going to Walmart and buying one. I absolutely hate this product.</li>
    <li> Would recommend to anyone that likes to straighten their hair easy to use and small enough to work with in hair</li>
    <li> I did not really like this straightener. I have really thick wavy hair and it took forever to get it straight with this. I&#x27;d have to go over the same strand at least 2-4 times just to get it decent looking. I don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time on my hair, so I want a straightener that gets the job done the first time. And it had a little comb thing attached to one side and that was just horrible. It kept pulling my hair out so I eventually took it off of.</li>
    <li> Delivered as how I had hoped. Though color of the straightener is not red, the straightener I had received was violet/red? Still a beautiful color. (: Would recommend this straightener. Fair price and excellent service. [...]</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see why any one would pay more for one. It heats up fast, stays hot and is a great size. Works very well. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> ive killed too many of the ones that i paid $60 for so i figured why not, go cheap kill it and get another one, this one outlasted the others...so impressed</li>
    <li> Good product and very fast shipping service.  Does not clamp down as tightly as some of my previous straighteners so it is a little more difficult to use.</li>
    <li> itst alright i mean  i dont use it cuz it doesnt straightn my hair like i wish and was hoping for so i cant say its amazing cuz its not</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this flatiron is how relatively quickly it breaks and falls apart. I&#x27;ve bought like 5 of them over the years though because otherwise I LOVE it!! Fav flatiron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Ive owned a couple of this same straightener and they have all worked well for the price. one con is that your hair often gets caught in the straightener and rips.. this could be solved by grabbing smaller strands but a wider straightener, as this one is, is usually expected to straighten more hair and it would be easier to be able to straighten larger sections of hair. Great product if you want a mid grade straightener.</li>
    <li> I have repurchased this flat iron 3 times, I Like it very WELL....WOULD RECOMEND TO ANYONE!!! sEEMS TO BE GENTLE ON THE HAIR!!!</li>
    <li> Best hair straightener I have ever used. The comb piece that you can attach works great to help straighten my thick and curly hair.</li>
    <li> Takes me 10 tries to get it to turn on, don&#x27;t get very hot on the highest setting, don&#x27;t have a swivel cord and it get twisted. Not happy with it at all.  I thought it was the exact same one as the one I already have but turns out it&#x27;s not as good as the one I have been using for the past 4 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had both the red one and black and purple one.  They both quit working after a couple years and I tried switching to a different one.  This is my favorite by far.  I even bought a chi one time and wasn&#x27;t impressed.  Love the comb it makes my long wavy hair nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> What do you expect from a hair straightener? It should straighten your hair, right? Well, this one does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It also heats up really fast. My sister has been using this one for 4 years (she has used it once a day) and it&#x27;s still working now. Would recommend this one to everyone because of the price and the durability.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my daughter and she was not happy with it she said it does not straighten very well.</li>
    <li> the heating is good, but the two ironers does not fit pretty well. Sometimes you need to push hard to iron the hair.opps</li>
    <li> my daughter just love this!!!&lt;br /&gt;its eays to use and it tells her when its ready to use  she just loves it</li>
    <li> This is the second straightener I have owned, this straightener gets really hot really fast and I havnt had any problems with it but besides maybe a little hair pulling..</li>
</ol>
