<li> I use this at night time, and yes, my skin is yellow/orange like fake tan, but at night, I don&#x27;t care.  </li>
<li> After reading the reviews, I was afraid to purchase this because of the orange part.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am very much satisfied with this purchase! Although I have been using other Buckthorn of other brands, this sea buckthorn oil is of a very good quality which earlier results.</li>
    <li> After receiving this Sea Buckthom, for the first couple of days I directly rubbed onto affected areas before going to sleep.  I used it undiluted and it was too much for my skin i guess. Now I mix it with rosehip oil and it works wonder for my skin. my skin is looking more radiant. I&#x27;m happy and definitely will be buying from Slice of Nature.</li>
    <li> The main reason for purchasing this oil is to get rid of my facial deterioration. Since using this product, my pores have greatly reduced in size... I really can&#x27;t believe the difference it has brought over my face. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love sea buckthorn oil as a part of daily skin care regiment.  However, this product is unusually orange compared to other sea buckthorn oils.  Worst of all, after a single application to the face before retiring to bed, I woke in the morning to find a terribly stained pillowcase and sheet. Will not be using this brand again.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I make my own face serums. So this is one of the products I add. It is one of many products I use in my serums and I use many differentt type of essential oils. I think next time I may try another brand but for now it is working very well.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I was afraid to purchase this because of the orange part.  After using it for a couple of weeks now, I can noticeably see a difference in the skin -- the wrinkles are fading and my eczema is clearing up nicely. I use this product at night to give my skin a chance to soak it in without being out in the stresses of the day.  (The sun, dirt, etc.) I&#x27;ve very very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> My son was unable to spend his hours freely because of his eczema spread on his hands. It kept him occupied with loneliness and irritation. We tried with other creams and lotions, but helpless. My neighbor suggested us to try this and we immediately ordered and it arrived very quickly. My son is very much great and recovering from it. We thank this brand for the lovely natural product.</li>
    <li> It seems to make my face younger with fewer wrinkles. With just 2 weeks of application, I have satisfying change. Definitely would continue using this oil.</li>
    <li> Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil is the most important skin care or personal item I have! If I had to choose only one item to keep or take with me anywhere this would be it! This oil is great on acne and extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> I recently met with an accident and had to undergo an operation which led behind a scar. I was using what the doctor recommended and it was doing OK. When I switched to the Sea Buckthorn, within 2 weeks my scar is almost invisible. I highly support this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased it to help my husband with his rosecea and it does work effectively! He puts this oil on his face after washing his face and before going to bed. He did find extreme positive results within a week and now he continues to take it in his routine.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Bought it to help my brother with his roseshea and it does! He puts this oil on his face after washing it before going to bed and it keeps it on the low. Truly a genuine product and I will be trying out other oils from them again.</li>
    <li> Great product ! It&#x27;s a second bottle for me after buying it first time in Chemberlins ( food store ) .&lt;br /&gt;Color is Orange , but I apply this oil 20-30 min before to go to bed .&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really help my skin. I highly recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> I have been fighting blemishes for months and this is the treatment that has shown the best results. It was hard to find locally but I am glad I found it here at a decent price. I would highly recommend trying this Sea Buckthorn oil</li>
    <li> A quick way to see results. The smell is great! O used the oil for my dark eye circles and after a few days I noticed a big difference! I now am using once a week. I heard about the oil turning your skin colors but mine has not (as of yet). Will update if it happens to have any negative affects.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for my honest unbiased reviews</li>
    <li> This oil is doing exactly like advertised and what I expected it to do, and it is definitely a saviour for me. I also found the product fairly priced other than rest in market.</li>
    <li> Bought it to help my husband with his rosecea and it does! He puts this oil on his face after washing it before going to bed and it keeps it on the low. Definitely a good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the past 4 days and I didn&#x27;t really expect this product to do what it did so when I saw my red spots fading. Absolutely it is true and virgin sea buckthorn! I am very much surprised</li>
    <li> I have faced extreme breakouts and really wanted to find a solution to stop it. My friend read an article about Sea buckthorn and asked me to try it out. Thank God, I tried it, as this oil has worked wonders for my face and neck. It made the pores get smaller so less dirt gets in and prevents breakouts. Happy with this purchase and so much thankful for this brand and my friend TARA.</li>
    <li> My daughter is the one using it for her pimples and she said she&#x27;s seeing some improvements already.  The only complaint is it makes her face orange at night which is not a problem since no one can see her in her bed.</li>
    <li> This brand provides the best of the best. This sea buckthorn is amazing and my skin has turned to silk and the age spots are disappearing. I love this oil.</li>
    <li> It has great effect on my wrinkles and dark spots too. I am very much relieved after starting its applications on my face. This is just beyond the money spent on its purchase. Just makes me feel very happy.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this and is less inflamed, reactive, oily, etc. with the use of seabuckthorn seed oil. It has lots of antioxidants, is great for rosacea, and is anti-aging. Seriously, this stuff has helped me so much.</li>
    <li> I am using it for my 11 month old daughter. It works well for any kind of rashes and keeps skin nice and soft!</li>
    <li> Clears dark spots on face&lt;br /&gt;Not oily clears mole like spots&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply right on spots not oily use every night&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a natural remedy for my face and I simply love it. Will order again when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> Since using this product, my pores have greatly reduced in size... I really can&#x27;t believe the difference. I absolutely love this product and I feel good to use something that actually builds up my hope.</li>
    <li> Best oil for your skin. I used it on my wounds and found this helps to heal them.&lt;br /&gt;Well it turns to orange but it will disappear in a little while. The best use is at night.</li>
    <li> I took a leap of faith, reading lots of reviews on this oil.  After just one night of using, I could already see a noticeable difference in the redness of my skin!  I&#x27;m still having issues with cystic acne, but I think that is more hormone related.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is orange.  Here&#x27;s what I do:  Currently I use a blend of coconut oil and argan oil as my daily moisturizer.  I melt about 1 c of coconut oil and stir in 2-3 tbsp of the argan oil.  This will solidify because of the lower melting point of coconut oil.  Once it&#x27;s hardened, I drop a few drops of the Buckthorn to one side of my shallow container and mix it with a bit of the other two oils.  I use this at night time, and yes, my skin is yellow/orange like fake tan, but at night, I don&#x27;t care.  During the day, I&#x27;ll dilute it even more for the morning, just putting a tiny bit of the yellow with the coconut/argan mixture.  If you&#x27;re going to put this on at night, do not use a white pillow case (I&#x27;ve included a photo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has helped a lot with redness.  My skin quality using the mixture has greatly improved, though I still feel like I&#x27;ve got a ways to go.  In the morning, my skin is not at all yellow, but has drastically reduced in redness.  I envision this bottle lasting me quite a while as I only use a drop or two and get it to spread using the other carrier oils.</li>
    <li> Slice of Nature has created a great thing. Buckthorn in their properties has unique properties and it was very useful for burns. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was initially hesitant of buying this oil, and even applying it on my skin after reading many reviews about the skin turning orange or yellow after use. I am blending a few drops of the Sea Buckthorn oil with my pure argan oil and using it as a night treatment daily for maximum absorption. I have not noticed any staining of my pillow or any yellowish tint on my skin. The two oils blend really well as they are both pure, the mix also feels very moisturizing and not greasy. The smell is fresh; not fishy or rancid. I have a really sensitive skin prone to breakouts and rashes. I first used it after I noticed my periodic acne appearing just to test its effectiveness and all the small bumps are now gone, the black spots on my chin are also fading away. It’s only been 3 weeks and the positive change on my skin is so noticeable. I live in a very hot and dry country but my face feels much smoother, hydrated all day, and with such a healthy glow, i&#x27;m amazed! This oil is doing exactly what this seller says and what I expected it to do, and it is definitely a keeper for me. I found the product fairly priced and shipping was also expedited quite fast. I will be buying again and I definitely recommend this seller for both quality product and good service!</li>
