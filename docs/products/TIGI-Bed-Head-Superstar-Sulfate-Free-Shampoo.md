      <li>I absolutely love the way this shampoo works.  </li>
      <li>However, I am SO glad that I came upon this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad they make this stuff</li>
      <li>I get compliments on my hair all the time, and I love the fact that this stuff doesn&#x27;t make my scalp break out in itchy flakes and rashes like sulfate shampoos.</li>
      <li>I cannot convey to you how much better my hair looks and feels.  </li>
      <li>I love the pump and the size</li>

      <li>I love this shampoo....</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love how it&#x27;s sulfate-free.</li>
      <li>Superstar Sulfate Shampoo and biolage conditioning balm are a great combination for curly girls, I would highly recommend both of these products.</li>
      <li>It lathers like a normal shampoo (which is impressive for being sulfate free) but doesn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.</li>
      <li>And it really gives my hair increased thickness and a nice texture!</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and love the volume it gives....</li>
      <li>The smell is fantastic and I love that it is sulfate free.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for people with fine hair like myself.</li>
      <li>I have extremely fine hair and an oily scalp that tends to suffer from product build-up.</li>
      <li>I use this in conjunction with the Superstar conditioner and my hair is super soft and shiny, smells great and</li>
      <li>Despite being free of sulfates, this shampoo has no problem lathering into a luxurious, strawberry cloud.</li>
      <li>PLEASE do something with this cheap bottle.</li>
      <li>the conditioner that goes with this shampoo is actually fabulous.</li>
      <li>On to another sulfate free shampoo .....</li>
      <li>Love the thickness of my hair when I use this shampoo - it really pumps up the volume!</li>
      <li>(well worth the investment!)  </li>
      <li>I put some of the shampoo in another bottle fearing that if I dropped the original bottle in the tub, the bottle would break.</li>
      <li>It smells great, but I can&#x27;t deal with how dry and frizzy</li>
      <li>but I wanted it to clean thoroughly as well.</li>
      <li>, so my shampoo has to clean.</li>
      <li>It lathers quite well and my hair feels clean after one usage.</li>
      <li>Having a subscription for a shampoo that is hard to find is awesome!  </li>
      <li>This shampoo not only smells good but also does what it says.  </li>
      <li>Normally I love Bed Head, but this one is a real dud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this shampoo daily, and surprisingly I don&#x27;t need to use the conditioner.</li>
      <li>For everyday hair care, using the Superstar shampoo and a pure boar bristle brush, I never knew my hair could look so great!  </li>
      <li>Luckily my husband likes it...</li>
      <li>my hair dye is looking more vibrant.</li>
      <li>It comes right to your doorstep quickly.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this for those who have straight, fine hair because it adds volume and body.</li>
      <li>My hair is of medium-long length, fine, straight</li>
      <li>The smell is great, and my hair does not feel dried and fried after using it.</li>
      <li>Not only this, but the product smells amazing.</li>
      <li>The first bottle of shampoo I received was 1/3 of the way full.</li>
      <li>I have medium-length hair and use about one pump&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price</li>
      <li>I have been using a couple of weeks and have had a lot of success.</li>
      <li>Definately worth the $$.</li>
      <li>My hair feels so clean and is very shiny.  </li>
      <li>After using the Superstar shampoo/conditioner, my hair is left very clean, not weighted down and has great shine.  </li>
      <li>The only downside is the smell (fake strawberry), which isn&#x27;t the best, but for sulfate free i&#x27;m ok with it.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo was by far the best sulfate-free product I&#x27;ve used and even adds a little bit of volume so my hair is not stick straight (exactly what I wanted).</li>
      <li>I have been trying to find a new sulfate free shampoo for awhile now, that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot of money.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for a sulfate free shampoo that would clean my hair well enough, (</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to shampoo, this was the first.</li>
      <li>Works great for my thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I will more than likely buy it again.</li>
      <li>It not only gets my hair clean, but my hair is soft, low frizz, good volume</li>
      <li>Since I started using this shampoo, my scalp has been feeling much better and it is rarely dry of itchy.</li>
      <li>My hair has a certain luster now after using these combo shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I would agree that I get a bit more volume, but people with fine hair should realize that their hair is probably never going to look thick just from a shampoo.    </li>
      <li>I was wanted a sulfate free shampoo and have heard of this brand, however, after using this for 1 day the back of my neck and ears started itching.</li>
      <li>I really adore this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one who writes reviews very often, but I felt compelled to write this one.</li>
      <li>Smells ok, but no thanks</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair  that is professionally colored and wanted to find a shampoo that did not have all the harsh chemicals. This was the worst product ever! It made my hair and scalp smell literally like a wet dog! The strawberry smell is horrible.  I read all the reviews and really researched this product especially since it comes with a very high price for a 8.5 oz tube (18.00 at Target).  Not happy with my purchase!  I gave it a try for a week and everyday my hair smelled worse.  My husband even asked me if I had washed my hair lately.  My body chemistry may not work with this product.</li>
    <li> When I bought this shampoo I was having some serious issues with my hair/scalp. I have extremely fine hair and an oily scalp that tends to suffer from product build-up. I was to the point where I was buying \\&quot;clarifying shampoos\\&quot; and about to go back to dandruff treatments.    However, I am SO glad that I came upon this product. It leaves virtually no residue on my scalp and within 2-3 uses, my scalp was no longer itchy. Not only this, but the product smells amazing. Scent does not normally seem to cling to my hair, but I can still smell this shampoo in my hair even the day after washing (and I&#x27;m a smoker). I would agree that I get a bit more volume, but people with fine hair should realize that their hair is probably never going to look thick just from a shampoo.    This shampoo goes a long way. I have medium-length hair and use about one pump&#x27;s worth. The shampoo is thick, but don&#x27;t expect too much lather, since this brand does not use the emulsifying ingredients to create lather that the drugstore brands employ. Try this with the conditioner and your hair will love you!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way this shampoo works.  It cleans well and leaves my hair shiny and soft.  The only downside is the smell (fake strawberry), which isn&#x27;t the best, but for sulfate free i&#x27;m ok with it.  Definately worth the $$.</li>
    <li> I have a water softener and this shampoo works well with it. Some sulfate free shampoos are not foamy enough but this product builds up enough suds. I use this shampoo daily, and surprisingly I don&#x27;t need to use the conditioner. My hair stylist says this shampoo has product in it, so it saves a step. I have to agree...my hair looks like I put styling product in it, when all I do is blow dry and go. I recommend this for those who have straight, fine hair because it adds volume and body.</li>
    <li> nothing special about it, my scalp breaks out every time I&#x27;m using it, had to go back to head &amp; shoulders</li>
    <li> My daughter and I just started to use this product this week.  Unfortunately, Amazon delivered it in really bad condition, with the pump broken, about 10% of the shampoo leaked out, and as we try to get the shampoo out, we waste 10% on the floor due to the messed up pump.    The product itself is great.  My daughter has really thick hair (I mean really thick, not the hair that women say is thick and is barely normal).  She has a slight wave, and we regularly straighten her hair in order for it to look smooth.  This shampoo has already helped with her hair&#x27;s appearance.  I read that sulfate free shampoo is supposed to help tame hair, and this one does do just that.  Her hair looked great, and straightening her hair tonight seemed to go quicker because a lot of the frizz was already gone.  I will definitely order it again, and hopefully Amazon will deliver it intact the next time.</li>
    <li> Having a subscription for a shampoo that is hard to find is awesome!  It comes right to your doorstep quickly.  The price is great, and if you have Brazilian Blowout, it&#x27;s perfect and sulfate free for that!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is thick (and I mean REALLY thick, like honey!), and smells like strawberry cough syrup. It lathers like a normal shampoo (which is impressive for being sulfate free) but doesn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair. I think there are many superior alternatives to the shampoo that are cheaper. 2 stars. Normally I love Bed Head, but this one is a real dud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the conditioner that goes with this shampoo is actually fabulous. I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware: I ordered directly from Amazon and not a private seller. The first bottle of shampoo I received was 1/3 of the way full. There was dried shampoo all over the bottle, but not the inside of the package. I didn&#x27;t bother opening it, just sent it back. The second bottle I received smelled rotten (like mold and chemicals) and the shampoo itself was thicker than the shampoo in the first bottle I received. Sent it back. The third bottle I received had thinner shampoo and smelled just okay. The shampoo was still very thick, however. (I did not give a 2-star review because of the shipping experience; the shampoo itself deserves 2-stars.)</li>
    <li> This shampoo not only smells good but also does what it says.  I still need to use a good amount because of having curly, long and thick hair.  I will more than likely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Despite being free of sulfates, this shampoo has no problem lathering into a luxurious, strawberry cloud. It gives my hair volume without stripping natural oils. My hair is soft and smells wonderful after using this shampoo. I also have the conditioner (which I would HIGHLY recommend) but don&#x27;t always need it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how well it cleans my thick, curly hair. The smell is fantastic and I love that it is sulfate free. I am a big fan of all Tigi products and wanted to try this particular line out (used S-Factor). I would recommend to anyone who has thick curly/wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used other sulfate-free shampoos before and found them to be expensive and usually a little heavy. This was totally different--my long, thick hair is left smooth and shiny but not weighed down. I also like the bulk sized bottles with pumps--easy in the shower and dispenses the perfect amount.    The one thing that bugged me a little at first was the scent. I&#x27;m not one of those scent-haters or anything but I don&#x27;t like things to smell artificial...after a few washes however I got used to it and now enjoy the fact that my hair remains softly scented later in the day</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I am allergic to sulfate and this is one of the best on the market.  As always Amazon did a great job!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells wonderful! I love, love, love how it&#x27;s sulfate-free. I used it for the first wash after I dyed my hair dark brown and the suds weren&#x27;t brown as they have been in the past with other shampoos. I&#x27;ve tried Jonathan Product Serious Volume Volumizing Shampoo(tm) , but it didn&#x27;t suds at all, you needed to use a lot and it&#x27;s was over-priced for the amount you got, so I switched to this product. I use this in conjunction with the Superstar conditioner and my hair is super soft and shiny, smells great and my hair dye is looking more vibrant. I recommend this product for people with fine hair like myself. I love the pump and the size will last you a long while.</li>
    <li> Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got this product and have been using it for three days.  I cannot convey to you how much better my hair looks and feels.  I have medium-length, somewhat wavy fine hair, and it gets very dry and flyaway in winter.  Since I started using Bed Head Superstar, my hair feels fuller, thicker, and noticeably less flyaway.  This is a great product.  I&#x27;m not one who writes reviews very often, but I felt compelled to write this one.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a new sulfate free shampoo for awhile now, that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot of money. Based on the reviews, I was hoping to find it with this shampoo. However, after several uses, I find my hair to be dryer than before. It smells great, but I can&#x27;t deal with how dry and frizzy my hair seems to be after using it. Luckily my husband likes it...otherwise, I feel like I&#x27;d wasted my money. On to another sulfate free shampoo .....</li>
    <li> I recently had my hair chemically straightened (Brazilian Blowout) and needed a sulfate-free shampoo and condition to protect the product. I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of sulfate-free shampoo and needed to wash my hair two times to feel like it was clean.  Not so with this product - it is sulfate-free, but does seem to have a little bit of a lather. This shampoo was by far the best sulfate-free product I&#x27;ve used and even adds a little bit of volume so my hair is not stick straight (exactly what I wanted). The only downside is that the shampoo smells sweet and a bit like candy, but once my hair was dry I could not smell the shampoo at all. I highly recommend both this shampoo and the Superstar conditioner.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to wait until I finished the entire bottle of shampoo to really give it a chance and sadly it did not work out for me. I didnt even finish the bottle. This shampoo did not clean my hair completely. It did a good job of taming my thick hair but I wanted it to clean thoroughly as well. One day after washing my hair with this product my hair was greasy. Sorry, I would not recommend this shampoo...</li>
    <li> I have been using the TIGI Bed Head Superstar shampoo for a few months and I love it.  My hair is of medium-long length, fine, straight and it&#x27;s somewhat thick.  I love that this shampoo is sulfate-free.  Even though it is sulfate-free, I&#x27;m impressed with how well it lathers.  I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive sulfate-free shampoos and they bareley lather at all.      After using the Superstar shampoo/conditioner, my hair is left very clean, not weighted down and has great shine.  The Strawberry yogurt scent is wonderful!  For excellent volumizing results, I also use a pure boar bristle hair brush (well worth the investment!)  For everyday hair care, using the Superstar shampoo and a pure boar bristle brush, I never knew my hair could look so great!  It&#x27;s amazing.  I&#x27;ll never need (or want) a perm again!</li>
    <li> TIGI Bed Head Shampoo is the best, never had a worry. This product is the best.[[ASIN:B000XTDYJW TIGI Bed Head Superstar Sulfate-Free Shampoo, 25.36 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! My hair feels professionally washed and not dry. It&#x27;s also easier on my color, it doesn&#x27;t fade as fast because there are less chemicals since its sulfate free.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! Totally worth the price and my hair has NEVER looked better! I was also having problems with residue on my hair making it look like I had dandruff, no more \\&quot;wannabe dandruff\\&quot; problem for me. THANK YOU BEDHEAD! Did I mention the shampoo as well as condition, smell AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> I really adore this shampoo. I have been using a couple of weeks and have had a lot of success. My hair is curly/wavy, medium textured and very long. I also get really dry itchy scalp during the harsh Wisconsin winters. I have been searching for a sulfate free shampoo that would clean my hair well enough, (I use conditioner, leave in conditioner, hair styling cream and spray gel., so my shampoo has to clean. I also only shampoo every other day or third day, co-washing in between. I have tried a few other sulfate shampoos to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is wonderful. It not only gets my hair clean, but my hair is soft, low frizz, good volume and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. Since I started using this shampoo, my scalp has been feeling much better and it is rarely dry of itchy. I use this shampoo along with biolage conditioning balm, which I have reviewed on here as well. Superstar Sulfate Shampoo and biolage conditioning balm are a great combination for curly girls, I would highly recommend both of these products.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo. The smell is great and my hair never looked so good, BUT, I hate the bottle. The plastic is so thin and the writing on the bottle is wearing off. PLEASE do something with this cheap bottle. I put some of the shampoo in another bottle fearing that if I dropped the original bottle in the tub, the bottle would break. Otherwise, great shampoo!</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling soft and healthier. Was uncertain about product after I saw the price, figured it would be cheaper to buy a dollar shampoo. But as my mom always told me, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My hair feels so clean and is very shiny.  I use the all the Superstar products and have got my family using them too.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo....I have fine hair and love the volume it gives....love the smell....so glad to still find it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have a sulfate allergy when it comes to shampoos, and this is the best product I have discovered so far. It lathers quite well and my hair feels clean after one usage. The smell is great, and my hair does not feel dried and fried after using it. I&#x27;m so glad they make this stuff and I hope they never stop. My hair has a certain luster now after using these combo shampoo and conditioner. I get compliments on my hair all the time, and I love the fact that this stuff doesn&#x27;t make my scalp break out in itchy flakes and rashes like sulfate shampoos. I reccommend to you whether or not you have a sulfate allergy. This stuff will not dry your hair out!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  Having curly hair, I have to be careful not to dry my hair out with the hair products I use.  The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit.  After putting conditioner on my hair, I can&#x27;t smell it anyhow.</li>
    <li> the pump sucks!!&lt;br /&gt; It is so hard to get it out, you just pump once and have to wait for the thing to come back up. Patience needed, and I don&#x27;t have that , so I didn&#x27;t like it. Smells ok, but no thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this becuase I was wanted a sulfate free shampoo and have heard of this brand, however, after using this for 1 day the back of my neck and ears started itching. I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to shampoo, this was the first. Also, the fake strawberry smell is terrible in my opinion. For a sulfate free shampoo, the lather was great. My husband is still using it with no allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and hair, and I never had problems with dandruff. This shampoo, however, made my hair really dry and full of dandruff.</li>
    <li> Finally a Big Bottle at a reasonable price..Love It!  Before, could only find small tubes, but now found a larger size shampoo for about the same price.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this shampoo!! And it really gives my hair increased thickness and a nice texture!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even finish using this bottle. Because it&#x27;s sulfate-free, it doesn&#x27;t lather well, but I&#x27;d be okay with that if it weren&#x27;t for the strange feeling of having leftover residue on the scalp after showering and after my hair is dry. I don&#x27;t think this moisturizes very well.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is supposed to be strawberry-related, but it&#x27;s more of a weird smell that screams artificial and playdough-y.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it. It weighed my hair down.</li>
    <li> Works great for my thick hair.  Cannot find in stores anymore.  Hate that when you find a product you love they quit selling it.</li>
    <li> Love the thickness of my hair when I use this shampoo - it really pumps up the volume! So happy I purchased this in the pump style. Great for the shower I share with my gent.</li>
