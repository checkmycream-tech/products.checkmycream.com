      <li>Well, it lathers well, cleans well, but most important for me smells incredible.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for clean scalp and shiny hair.</li>

      <li>Leaves hair very shiny and fragrance is great.  </li>
      <li>It s ok but the hair looks not so shinny</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I don&#x27;t know.....</li>
      <li>I would like it better odorless.</li>
      <li>should buy also the Elixir Ultimate (oleo-complex) for better results!!!!!</li>
      <li>This one is actually ok on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>and i LOVE it.</li>
      <li>This product line is the best from all other products out there.</li>
      <li>item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
      <li>Hair is so light and smooth</li>
      <li>but, it&#x27;s worth ever penny!</li>
      <li>it totally worth the price!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never once felt as if it didn&#x27;t clean my hair.</li>
      <li>The product was delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>The cons is that it&#x27;s very perfumed, the argon oil is quite strong scented.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably pretty good, but you&#x27;re still going to need to put something in your hair, probably, to add moisture back to it after using this product.</li>
      <li>This shampoo does exactly what it claims to do!</li>
      <li>However, it is worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic and makes my hair feel soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I jusr dont think it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>It is kind of like baby powder mixed with verbena.  </li>
      <li>I use this as my everyday shampoo and it is very gentle but does a great job.  </li>
      <li>My hair was soft and shiny, easy to comb.</li>
      <li>it did so very fast and came a week ahead of scheduled.</li>
      <li>And I absolutely did!</li>
      <li>Lather-free, deep cleansing while working its magic leaving hair feeling like nothing I&#x27;ve ever felt before, when you rinse.</li>
      <li>Saw a difference from the first use with this shampoo.</li>
      <li>this totally transform my hair and if you use it with the mask is even better</li>
      <li>It is light and not too soapy, but if you want soap suds all you have to do is just add a little more to your hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Kerastase, and so I really wanted to love this product.</li>
      <li>I even saw a few reviews comparing it to other &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; (no poo &#x3D; no shampoo) products, and thought it would be perfect for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This changes my hair, shiny, strong, less split ends, amazing light, will not weigh you down.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel super soft.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very damaged because of all the chemicals for coloring I put onto it.  </li>
      <li>I have always had very healthy and straight hair but will discontinue this product in order to add bounce and life back to my long, brown hair.</li>
      <li>Highly reccomend!</li>
      <li>I have very long/thick hair</li>
      <li>They both work really well together.</li>
      <li>besides, I tried myself this one for a whole bottle, nothing worked.  </li>
      <li>My naturally curly hair (which I blow out straight and flat iron) was noticeably more shiny and moisturized.</li>
      <li>You really only need a small amount, maybe a nickel size at the most, though using more can be tempting as it doesn&#x27;t leave you with that soapy, lathered, hyper-clean feeling cheaper shampoos do.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have tried this and most likely the last.  </li>
      <li>so when I saw the new elixir line I was very tempted to try it.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s less &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and more &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; or something</li>
      <li>I was pretty excited to find it, and thought that a &amp;#34;cleansing oil shampoo&amp;#34; might be something like Wen or other cleaning conditioners, but with all the charm and wonder of the Kerastase Elixir oil that does wonders for my hair.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I switched from davines lovely smooth shampoo hoping this would at least be on the same level</li>
      <li>BUT, I have to say this product is 100% worth the extra expense.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to almost all shampoos out there and am always wanting to try a new one.  </li>
      <li>this shampoo make your hair super dry.</li>
      <li>Have to use a little more than my previous shampoo to get my hair clean.  </li>
      <li>This with the elixir ultime masque is the first combination to keep my hair totally frizz-free.</li>
      <li>This one works well, my hair feels soft, but still needs conditioner.  </li>
      <li>makes your hair silky soft.</li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to scents like I am, dont&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
      <li>It is an upgraded version of the Bain Vital range.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair extremely soft and non-frizzy</li>
      <li>The smell is clean but a little overpowering for me.</li>
      <li>My hair is currently very damaged and dry.</li>
      <li>From the second you apply, to the minute you rinse and feel how soft and silky your hair can be, it&#x27;s transformative.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny if not more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much smoother and takes less work with my irons.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Recommended by my hairdresser. Best shampoo I have ever used. My hair is now so much more manageable and looks and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Decided to try this out because I have been a stylist for 21 years and I wanted to see what the hype was about. Well, it lathers well, cleans well, but most important for me smells incredible. It does what it is supposed to, but the great fragrance is an added bonus!</li>
    <li> not for dry damaged hair</li>
    <li> The product was delivered quickly. And made my hair look fantastic!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as expected!&lt;br /&gt;Kerastase is the best Brand for keeping healthy hair! Great prodct.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend their use</li>
    <li> It s ok but the hair looks not so shinny</li>
    <li> I use this as my everyday shampoo and it is very gentle but does a great job.  I&#x27;m allergic to almost all shampoos out there and am always wanting to try a new one.  This one is actually ok on my scalp.  My hair is very damaged because of all the chemicals for coloring I put onto it.  This product definitely helps but it is still damaged.  It&#x27;s much smoother and takes less work with my irons.  And even though expensive, it goes a long way.  You really do only need a quarter size and my hair is to my shoulders.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it did not wow me as i had thought it would. I switched from davines lovely smooth shampoo hoping this would at least be on the same level and it is not. My hair bwcomes very flat and looks like i have not washed it. When i blow dry it, it is still very flat and the next day very dry. The smell is very strong. I jusr dont think it is worth the money. BUUTT the comoany who shipped it did so very fast and came a week ahead of scheduled. So thats always great!</li>
    <li> i was recommended to use this before my wedding to get great looking hair and i LOVE it. much better price than at the salon too!</li>
    <li> I will never buy anything else but this wonderful stuff.</li>
    <li> I have always loved kerastase products. This is the first time I have tried this and most likely the last.  It doesn&#x27;t soap up well and makes my hair feel straw like not smooth.  The smell is clean but a little overpowering for me.</li>
    <li> Thank you for making this! It&#x27;s awesome! 😉</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! It is light and not too soapy, but if you want soap suds all you have to do is just add a little more to your hair. It smells incredible and leaves your hair shiny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Kerastase, and so I really wanted to love this product. I was pretty excited to find it, and thought that a &amp;#34;cleansing oil shampoo&amp;#34; might be something like Wen or other cleaning conditioners, but with all the charm and wonder of the Kerastase Elixir oil that does wonders for my hair. I even saw a few reviews comparing it to other &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; (no poo &#x3D; no shampoo) products, and thought it would be perfect for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected this product to clean my hair while giving it all the conditioning and moisturizing benefits of the Elixir Ultime oil, but I was wrong; this shampoo is, in fact, a shampoo. It&#x27;s probably pretty good, but you&#x27;re still going to need to put something in your hair, probably, to add moisture back to it after using this product. Since that&#x27;s not what I was looking for, I&#x27;m not going to repurchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you&#x27;re looking for a good shampoo and thinking about buying this, this is a good choice. If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s less &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and more &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; or something, this isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;Mostly my bad, but just so you&#x27;d know. I guess the &amp;#34;cleansing oil&amp;#34; name is pretty confusing.</li>
    <li> Almost immediately you feel your hair start to get conditioned as you are shampooing .  Leaves hair very shiny and fragrance is great.  Will  definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! My stylist told me it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; not just a shampoo and promised I would see improvement in one use. And I absolutely did! It smells fantastic and makes my hair feel soft and smooth. This with the elixir ultime masque is the first combination to keep my hair totally frizz-free. So happy with this line!</li>
    <li> pretty nice shampoo, this all purpose, for all hair types product!</li>
    <li> I use kerastase products for a long time, this time I decide to try from amazon. this shampoo make your hair super dry. no real product</li>
    <li> Holy moly! This shampoo detangled my hair yet it&#x27;s not a conditioner!! Hair is so light and smooth feels like you don&#x27;t need conditioner! I have expensive detangling conditioners that don&#x27;t condition half as much as this shampoo !</li>
    <li> After trying nearly every high end shampoo and conditioner I could get my hands on over the years, this one is literally a game changer. From the second you apply, to the minute you rinse and feel how soft and silky your hair can be, it&#x27;s transformative. Lather-free, deep cleansing while working its magic leaving hair feeling like nothing I&#x27;ve ever felt before, when you rinse. All three products in this line work wonders together!</li>
    <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo. It&#x27;s nice but nothing exceptional.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks amazing now.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it is expensive! No doubt about it! And you might need to apply twice if you like foam, otherwise, you will feel your hair is not clean enough. However, it is worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;You should buy also the Elixir Ultimate (oleo-complex) for better results!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure , alittle drying.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair extremely soft and non-frizzy</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described!</li>
    <li> BEST SHAMPOO EVER! it totally worth the price! i can&#x27;t use any other shampoo this totally transform my hair and if you use it with the mask is even better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Kerastase product so when I saw the new elixir line I was very tempted to try it. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It is an upgraded version of the Bain Vital range.</li>
    <li> THIS is a fake! besides, I tried myself this one for a whole bottle, nothing worked.  the code and the multi language part in the back of the bottle are TOTALLY different than the one I bought from the official website. I Do think this is a fake, but only because I am a big fan of Kerastase for 3 yrs, but AMAZON actually does not guarantee this product. Kerastase says they never authorities Amazon as I phoned them..</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel super soft.  Have to use a little more than my previous shampoo to get my hair clean.  Smells good though!</li>
    <li> This product line is the best from all other products out there. I have tried many expensive brands and none of them come close. Every time I used this product it feels like I just had a brand-new haircut. It is worth every penny if not more. Hopefully they never discontinue this item like they do with others.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does exactly what it claims to do! It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and has the most beautiful scent I&#x27;ve ever encountered in a shampoo! It left my long, thin, processed hair feeling soft, silky and shiny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not typically one to purchase expensive shampoos or conditioners.. BUT, I have to say this product is 100% worth the extra expense. Truly liquid gold! Felt like you almost didnt even need conditioner after you rinsed! My naturally curly hair (which I blow out straight and flat iron) was noticeably more shiny and moisturized. You also only need a little.. Less than your \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shampoo! I have very long/thick hair and I poured on my usual amount and felt like I could have used much less and been sufficient. Highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> Hate the smell!!  And definitely not nourishing enough for my long thick hair.  Sorry I wasted my money trying this new product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Kerastase products for 8 years now.  This one works well, my hair feels soft, but still needs conditioner.  It is the smell that I find objectionable.  It is kind of like baby powder mixed with verbena.  I would like it better odorless.</li>
    <li> Great product that arrived on time</li>
    <li> This shampoo had the adverse effect on my hair as compared to all the glowing reviews. My hair became dry and flat rather than moisturized. Like straw. I have always had very healthy and straight hair but will discontinue this product in order to add bounce and life back to my long, brown hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is currently very damaged and dry. It felt like this shampoo didn&#x27;t help, maybe even made it feel drier,</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so silky and soft even after I damaged it pretty bad after bleaching. I&#x27;ve tried most of these products and I must say that it is worth every penny!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I don&#x27;t know.....I wanna go and see at the end of the bottle the result on my hair</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to think because most of the reviews are glorifying this product, but this very expensive shampoo made my hair extremely dry and brittle-akin to wire wool. No kidding.  I used it only 3 times, each time with the same results. This product is either a big joke that&#x27;s very well marketed, or my bottle is a fake, an expensive one at that.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for clean scalp and shiny hair. That is the pros. The cons is that it&#x27;s very perfumed, the argon oil is quite strong scented. If you are sensitive to scents like I am, dont&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> excellent smell. makes your hair silky soft. a little goes far. I use it in conjunction with the mask. I totally recommend it</li>
    <li> Have dry, fine hair and it&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair or leaves it limp without any volume. Saw a difference from the first use with this shampoo. My hair was soft and shiny, easy to comb. My boyfriend loves the scent and is always sniffing my hair lol!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!! Can&#x27;t rave enough about the &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34;results of the shampoo in conjunction with the Masque!  My hair is damaged, dry, from over processing.  I have tried a wide selection of shampoos and masques, with minimal results after prolonged use. This is my &amp;#34;holy grail!&amp;#34;  I Will never be with out both products.  I placed my second order immediately after my initial use.  I was skeptical because of the price but, it&#x27;s worth ever penny!</li>
    <li> i used to be a WEN girl but it kept drying my hair out and it was not longer managable.  my stylist wanted to switch me to this.  I cannot be without 3 in spare!  This changes my hair, shiny, strong, less split ends, amazing light, will not weigh you down.  will not ever change!</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years and my hair has never been healthier. You really only need a small amount, maybe a nickel size at the most, though using more can be tempting as it doesn&#x27;t leave you with that soapy, lathered, hyper-clean feeling cheaper shampoos do. Even so, it does a great job and I&#x27;ve never once felt as if it didn&#x27;t clean my hair. My hair is stronger, thicker, and has less split ends. It&#x27;s also grown faster than it ever has in the past. I can&#x27;t rave about this enough. I should also mention that I use it alongside the &amp;#34;Kerastase Elixir Ultime Masque Treatment&amp;#34; once a week. They both work really well together.</li>
