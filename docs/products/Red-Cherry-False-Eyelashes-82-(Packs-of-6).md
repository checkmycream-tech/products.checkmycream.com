<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love them!  Very natural, very light, and they look great!</li>
    <li> Long lasting, I can wear mine for 4-5 days (taking them off every evening). Love the fullness and length. Definitely more natural than some others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Love red cherry lashes and fit your eye perfect no need to cut to make them fit like other kind.  Feel naked without them :-). So many compliments too</li>
    <li> Great standard goto lashes. Awesome price for the quality. Quality is comparable to MAC lashes.</li>
    <li> I love red cherry lashes</li>
    <li> i got these lashes for my sister for her b day and she loves red cherry lashes now. i need to order some more and different styles.</li>
    <li> I love this brand they are glamorous and attractive. I will continue to purchase this brand. I highly recommend these lashes.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful, these are my favorites alongside with #43.&lt;br /&gt;I love them. I will definitely repurchase more of these lashes.</li>
    <li> These false eyelashes are my favorite! They&#x27;re very similar to Ardell&#x27;s 105 lashes. However, I prefer these, because they are way cheaper and still look fabulous! Ardell lashes usually run from $4 - $6 EACH. So I think this is a wonderful purchase. After finding these, I will never purchase Ardell lashes again. I have ordered this product multiple times &amp; will continue to order it in the future. I recommend these to anyone who enjoys wearing long, beautiful lashes.</li>
    <li> love these they are my favorite red cherry lashes. I plan on ordering them again. They are easy to install and look and feel so natural.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite  eyelashes I always get asked if mine because they look so natural and pretty</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need these to be beautiful, but I like spending money on useless stuff so why not? They really make me look pretty and expensive. I feel like a high level escort woman of the night in these lashes and the seller was top notch I received them very quickly. I love Red Cherry lashes, but in the last decade they really raised the prices on these suckers so I like that I can purchase them on amazon.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, subtle and versatile. More innocent looking than a cat eye style. Quite long but not overly curled.</li>
    <li> Amazing, great quality lashes. Very comfortable and light, wearable all night. My eyes usually get itchy when I wear falsies but these ones don&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re wearing any. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> these bad boys are so light weight i love it! they are long, and i like my false eyelashes long but they are much lighter than im use to and that makes me love them even more!!</li>
    <li> I love these.  I wear them all the time. The price is fantastic and received them exactly when they stated. I will gladly purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife. Red Cherry is her favorite brand, as they fit her perfectly and look very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also uses them more than once, since their build quality is so great!</li>
    <li> I am lash challenged, so I got these for a nice little lash booster when I go out, they look natural, I did some grooming on them, very comfortable and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> There are always a few pairs in a bulk where the lashes are uneven however, I love this style and the quality for the price here on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat! There are so many other bulk eyelash companies out there and they just do not compare to Amazon&#x27;s prices! Wait for the price to go down like I did and order it in multiples, you will stock up and never go without!</li>
    <li> Perfect will order more there affordable and look great on feel great and you can wear more then once awesome!!!</li>
    <li> First the picture makes these lashes look more dense then they actually are. They are super thin and too long I dont know how they appear natural . You can tell your wearing falsies right away. They are easy to apply and wear they&#x27;re comfortable. But I wouldnt order again I&#x27;m sticking to my Ardells !</li>
    <li> These are AMAZING, but inly buy them if you going for a super dramatic look they are super long.&lt;br /&gt;-jessica</li>
    <li> These glam up a look. You can try to reuse them but don&#x27;t put mascara on them unless you feel like cleaning them!</li>
    <li> They were thick and full, but not very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking. Would totally order again though. Very much enjoyed them. :D</li>
    <li> I wear fakies when I have events to attend. They are natural but nice and long - if I could just put them on better...</li>
    <li> I will always order mooorrre cos it look Ah!mazingly natural</li>
    <li> They arrived on time, and give a great natural look.</li>
    <li> Came on time but I thought I ordered more natural lash. This is more for cosplay or costume. Very fake if you want fake look</li>
    <li> Just purchased these in placement of the $3 ones I usually get from stores. These came in packs of 6 for about $10, which is a really good deal because by this point I would have already spent about $24. This is a cute style, however, I didn&#x27;t now they would be so long!! They&#x27;re too long to seem real and this is my biggest complaint. The pictures don&#x27;t give you a more realistic idea of how the product actually is. I will purchase again from the seller and the brand, however, this style is not one that I would get again because it just is too long for me.</li>
    <li> These we the best lashes ever, I usually get lash extentions but these lashes are  gorgeous.  No wonder Kim K wears them</li>
    <li> I love these! Looks great and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these lashes before and they are my absolute favorite, it&#x27;s also a deal to get 6 for $11. I was wondering when they were shipping, so I emailed them and responded quickly and helpful as possible. Totally recommend this and from this seller!</li>
    <li> Best false lashes I have ever used! Easy application and they look amazing!</li>
    <li> I love them but them. So natural looking. Only con is they don&#x27;t really last for other uses after removal.</li>
    <li> LOVE these eyelashes. It adds nice flirty and cute essence when you wear them. I am the type of person that likes natural makeup. These eyelashes will not steal your show. There are ladies that wear too much eyelashes for their eyes that you can&#x27;t even see their eyes. These won&#x27;t do that. Additionally, these are really easy to cut and they don&#x27;t leave really harsh edges if you do cut them. I love them! Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I just started wearing eyelashes to give my own real ones a break from the curling and mascara.  I started by wearing Sephora&#x27;s and MAC&#x27;s.  Those are very light and airy, while the line from which they attach is thin and moves much easier.  These Red Cherry eyelashes are much heavier, the attach line is thicker and harder to move, and they are way WAY too long.  I try to look as natural as possible and there is no way anyone could pull these off unless they were deliberately going for the fake look.  I love the way they look but it is just not the look that I am going for.  I don&#x27;t like looking like a drag queen.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Item as described thanks!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! These are made of human hair and are super soft! They were a little long for me, so I cut them and they worked fine. Very natural looking and priced reasonably.</li>
    <li> I love the #82&#x27;s, they are perfect for my face farm. I will be getting these again</li>
    <li> The best quality eyelashes, including length, natural look, and fit! Number 82!!</li>
    <li> A big fan of red cherry eyelashes!!! These are long and look so natural, this has to be my 100th time buying this eyelashes. You won&#x27;t find good quality in another eyelash after you use these. What I like so much about them is they can last for a week, you can sleep, shower, and etc with them on. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are so big and pretty! Great quality and came very fast. I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out!</li>
    <li> Love,love these!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many styles and brands, but these are my very favorite!&lt;br /&gt;They also look great without mascara.</li>
    <li> Looks pretty natural, my husband couldn&#x27;t tell they weren&#x27;t mine. They add great length and are durable with a thin crisscross strip (as shown in photo) They are one of my favorite styles.</li>
    <li> Awesome lash for everyday wear, this model is long lush and full but if you want more drama then go with the &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; lash is size 101, 199 or 304 from Red Cherry</li>
    <li> Love them! They came very quick and were packed very well. They are very light and fluffy and make my eyes pop! Will buy again for sure;)</li>
    <li> The last batch I purchased were not shaped exactly the way they used to be shaped.  I found it a little harder to work with.</li>
    <li> My favorite. I loved these eyelashes so much. I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to lashes and tried a few from ardell.  I found these to be far superior in comfort and hair quality.  I had a much easier time applying them also probably because the lash line is very thin and easy to adjust. Will be buying more from this brand.  Oh, and my coworkers couldn&#x27;t even tell I had falsifies on.</li>
    <li> i am completely satisfied with these lashes. Will purchase them again and since Kim K also wears them it is a plus</li>
    <li> These lashes looked different from the website, they are also very thin!</li>
    <li> These lashes look natural and fluffy without being too much.  A little more than what I would wear on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I only recently began wearing false lashes on a regular basis. It can be a pain finding the right one that doesn&#x27;t look fake and feels natural. I&#x27;ve gone through a number of different types and I had pretty much settled on the idea that my eyelids would always feel heavy and anything I wore would just not feel natural if I wanted it to look nice and long. I was wrong! These lashes are amazing! they feel so light, and they still look WOW. I love them, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more! :D</li>
    <li> Love it my favorite brand and style</li>
    <li> She says they are very easy to put on and she wears then all the time! Be warned that it DOES NOT come with lash glue so but some at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes, but they are much thicker and longer than the picture shows. I have smaller-ish eyes and the lashes are noticeably fake. However, I love the brand of lashes!</li>
    <li> Bought #82 (Packs of 6) eyelashes and they are def not for daily use. Very drag queen. If you like the over the top fake look, this will work for you. I bought them to wear in videos and they seem too big even for me.</li>
    <li> makes your eyes pop! love these this was the 3rd  time i purchased them and plan on buying them more too!</li>
    <li> Great for the price, I will purchase again light feel long and lovely. I purchased many different types of lashes over the years and this one is my absolute all time favorite brand and number #82 You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes. Not to thick and very natural looking.</li>
    <li> If you are going for a dramatic look or full, long lashes, then these are not it. They are more for a natural look. You can wear these everyday. When I say I want dramatic look, I am not referring to drag-queen look...I would like the look you get when you stack 2 pairs of lashes together..I would like to find one pair that can accomplish this.  Good value for the price.. I would recommend for beginners or for a very natural, subtle look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to falsies and heard these were good so I bought some. I also had a couple of pairs from W-Mart and while those were pretty annoying but I dealt with them... these are pretty great. I can tell I&#x27;m wearing them, but I don&#x27;t walk around feeling like I have stiff falsies on like the others. This particular number (82) is pretty good for just looking like I have longer lashes... definitely not obvious that they are false. Since I am new to falsies and I&#x27;m still practicing at sizing them AND applying them, I&#x27;m glad this came with 6 pairs. I will definitely buy more of this particular one, and more from this brand.</li>
    <li> These are so big and full. Love these. Maybe not for everyday wear but definitely for that extra BAM! If that&#x27;s a look you seek every day then these are perfffff</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t worn the lashes yet but I have tried one on and it looks extremely natural. Just from the packaging I could tell that they&#x27;re great quality lashes. I&#x27;ll be back for more :)</li>
    <li> They cut easily, look beautiful and natural. They look exactly as shown in the photo. I paired them with Duo Lash Adhesive (clear) and they lasted all night; could have lasted through the next day I&#x27;m sure. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These are now my favorite lashes. They&#x27;re so natural looking and easy to wear.</li>
    <li> Love them just alittle pricy for me will get some more if the price was little lower</li>
    <li> Love how these fit and feel.</li>
    <li> Best lashes ever worn</li>
    <li> My new favorite eyelashes</li>
    <li> These lashes are great. If you know how to put on lashes probperly (I put mine right on top of my lashes) you never see a lash line I get so many compliments from makeup artist on how i apply them. Try them they work! Great for applying underneath your eyelashes as well.</li>
