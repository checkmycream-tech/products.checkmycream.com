      <li>Excellent Seller!</li>
      <li>For the price is amazing compared to what styles you can create!!!</li>
      <li>My daughter and I had a great time playing with this kit.</li>
      <li>I was happy with this product, so was my daughter.</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t as great as TV commercials make it out to be (but that isn&#x27;t surprising).  </li>

      <li>i was thrilled to try this product .when</li>
      <li>I thought it&#x27;s nice...</li>
      <li>To anyone who has normal/thin hair: I&#x27;m sure this product will work great for you, and you can feel free to ignore this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>thi has everything but its not as easy as it looks good luck with it</li>
      <li>Okay so, honestly this was the item I was looking forward to.</li>
      <li>but so far everything else is great!</li>
      <li>It looked very cheap when I received it and</li>
      <li>I am sure this kit could do some cute stuff</li>
      <li>Chances are you&#x27;d have better luck trying to roll your hair with and</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the hairagami tool many times and I love the versatility.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking to learn how to learn more ways to style my hair, and with this it will be easier.</li>
      <li>You could do much better with a box of bobby pins and some imagination.</li>
      <li>It has directions for most of them though.  </li>
      <li>I have not looked at the CD yet, maybe it has more instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought better quality items at the Dollar Store.</li>
      <li>I wish I had read more reviews before I bought this product.</li>
      <li>I found that none of these &#x27;doodads&#x27; created a look that I thought to be appealing.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>, More like a $1 value for $14.</li>
      <li>Well, I was baffled by these and have no idea how to use them, they look flimsy and easily breakable.</li>

      <li>The ring like every item in this kit is cheap plastic and as you&#x27;re examining the cards it opens by itself and the cards fall</li>
      <li>it came in the mail it  was packed securely.</li>
      <li>They look cheap and they feel cheap.</li>
      <li>everything was cheaply made...</li>
      <li>The hair accessories looked cheap and when I opened the box, it was to find all the contents in a ziplock bag, which I guess is the &amp;#34;travel case&amp;#34; to which the producers refer.</li>
      <li>I had no problem using most of the product in this kit the first time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(they look easy enough to make on my own).  </li>
      <li>The ones that did work broke quickly.</li>
      <li>The rest of the styles looked cute in the instructions, but my hair was too long to do most of them.</li>
      <li>The style cards seemed easy to follow, we just had too much hair to do the steps.  </li>
      <li>Was it really a $60 value for $14?!?!?...</li>
      <li>Exactly as described!</li>
      <li>Item was exactly as described!  </li>
      <li>why), they do have like 3 step instructions on some, and on others you clearly need more info</li>
      <li>Her hair looks so nice, yet she spends only seconds on it.  </li>
      <li>If you think that 2 or 3 of the things would benefit you, then it is well worth giving it a try.</li>
      <li>Just having the hair parting tool is worth purchasing the whole kit (the tool would be around $15 after shipping charges, and this kit is $30 with free shipping.  </li>
      <li>why), they do have like 3 step instructions on some, and on others you clearly need more info</li>
      <li>Product is economical for all the clips offered in the makeover kit.</li>
      <li>the person I bought it for doesn&#x27;t even use it because the products did not seem to be as useful as it showed.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for anyone with long hair who wants to be able to do something with it quickly and still have it look stylish.</li>
      <li>Very user friendly.</li>
      <li>The other products are good, too.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t hold it right</li>
      <li>I liked the hairgami products that I have used in the past and needed one more piece to accomplish the look that I wanted.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend trying this product if you would like to experiment with fun ways to do pony tails, braids, and creative sassy up-dos.</li>
      <li>i spent 10$ on something i could have found in better condition at a thrift store...and it probobly would be cheaper at a thrift store too!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re more like picture mini-cards that show you how your hair is supposed to look like with the different items (except the www.pins, I&#x27;ve no idea</li>

      <li>Lots more tools for only another $15)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Extremely fast shipping!</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to open it at the top, the items just sort of fell</li>
      <li>VERY DISSATISFIED!</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to open it at the top, the items just sort of fell</li>
      <li>i am very upset!</li>
      <li>This kit gives you several pieces that give one many options for styling your hair.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps if we had thinner hair it wouldn&#x27;t have been so abusive on the hair clips that were included, and would have warranted a higher rating.  </li>
      <li>I was getting married and the lady that was supposed to do my hair and makeup backed out two weeks before my wedding.</li>
      <li>Anyway, you put your long hair in between the bands and you&#x27;re supposed to be able to roll your hair up and then curve the bands to form a bun, a sleek looking bun....</li>
      <li>it opens before you&#x27;re ready.</li>
      <li>This is where is I got very discouraged.  </li>
      <li>Much smaller/cheaper versions are included.</li>
      <li>but it made sense to just buy the whole kit because it was affordable.  </li>
      <li>I have waist-length straight hair.</li>
      <li>They appear to very flimsy indeed.</li>
      <li>For us though, not so much.</li>
      <li>Well, no such luck, we&#x27;ve established that the items look and feel cheap</li>
      <li>I liked this product and would recommend it to anyone that would like to move beyond scrunchies and ponytails everyday for work.</li>
      <li>It takes a little practice with some of the tools in this kit but with most of them i got right away.</li>
      <li>While she does have her favorite styles, she also enjoys experimenting with other styles, too.  </li>
      <li>Some of them do take a bit of practice to get the hang of, but none of them are particularly complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>First of all, the DVD in it is so old that it will not play on any type of new technology.  </li>
      <li>I had high expectations for the product</li>
      <li>I ordered this to try some new things out for my daughters hair.</li>
      <li>However, it has benefits and is cheap enough that we would definitely buy it again.  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled that I could get a kit with the piece that I needed and a few extras to play with later on.</li>
      <li>Well, it&#x27;s the exact same thing, except they&#x27;re 2</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please DO Not Waste Your Time and Money buying this.whack, just look at the pictures!...</li>
      <li>The dvd was not even in a proper case, thereby making it easy for the other items to scratch it.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>We bought this for our 14 year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this as a birthday present for my friend who is really into styling her hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please DO Not Waste Your Time and Money buying this.</li>
      <li>I would say that for the price it is ok to only find benefit from a few of the things.  </li>
      <li>I have since watched the little dvd that came with it and tried out a few of the other looks, which take patience but look great once you figure them out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard and time consuming to do a half pony tail thing while crossing locks of hair and putting bobby pins in place, but it looks nice and professional.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Enclosed CD demonstrates use of items not in box.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes this product.  She has thick, wavy hair.  She can&#x27;t use everything that is in the box but the things she can use she likes a lot.  I would say that for the price it is ok to only find benefit from a few of the things.  This product isn&#x27;t as great as TV commercials make it out to be (but that isn&#x27;t surprising).  However, it has benefits and is cheap enough that we would definitely buy it again.  If you think that 2 or 3 of the things would benefit you, then it is well worth giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read more reviews before I bought this product. My daughter and I both have very thick long hair, and many of the accessories that came with this would just NOT work with our hair type. The ones that did work broke quickly. The style cards seemed easy to follow, we just had too much hair to do the steps.  Perhaps if we had thinner hair it wouldn&#x27;t have been so abusive on the hair clips that were included, and would have warranted a higher rating.  For us though, not so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen the informercials for the hairigami products but didn&#x27;t think they could possibly work as well as shown.  I was pleasantly surprised.  My hair is past my waste and fine but dense.  I had no problem using most of the product in this kit the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially liked the original Hairigami and the spring rings.  The other products are good, too.  Some of them do take a bit of practice to get the hang of, but none of them are particularly complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the products in the kits are durable and a good value for the money.  I recommend this product for anyone with long hair who wants to be able to do something with it quickly and still have it look stylish.</li>
    <li> Very hard to use, maybe with a lot of practice it would get easier.  Don&#x27;t buy if you are planning to use immediately.  This is where is I got very discouraged.  Just haven&#x27;t had the time to play with it so it&#x27;s sitting in the box!</li>
    <li> I was happy with this product, so was my daughter. We will definitely get a lot of use out of it. Thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I actually only wanted 1 tool but it made sense to just buy the whole kit because it was affordable.  Just having the hair parting tool is worth purchasing the whole kit (the tool would be around $15 after shipping charges, and this kit is $30 with free shipping.  Lots more tools for only another $15)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the hairagami tool many times and I love the versatility.  It does take a lot of practice to get used to how to use it properly.  Give it patience and some time, don&#x27;t give up if you can&#x27;t get your hair right the first few tries.  I have not tried all the tools in this kit yet, but just from the few that I have tried there are endless options for styling your hair.  My only complaint is that the book that comes with it does not have directions on how to style all the sample photos that are on the outside of the box. It has directions for most of them though.  I have not looked at the CD yet, maybe it has more instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used some of these tools years ago when I had hair down to my waist.  Now my hair is just a little past my shoulders and these tools still work, I just have to use them a little differently.  I would definitely recommend trying this product if you would like to experiment with fun ways to do pony tails, braids, and creative sassy up-dos.</li>
    <li> I found that none of these &#x27;doodads&#x27; created a look that I thought to be appealing.  I would not order this again.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our 14 year old daughter for Christmas.  She uses it practically every day.  While she does have her favorite styles, she also enjoys experimenting with other styles, too.  Her hair looks so nice, yet she spends only seconds on it.  She even does my hair on occasion!  :)</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it out yet, it&#x27;s everything I want for my hair.</li>
    <li> This was a real disappointment.  The directions are very vague and the products cheap.  If you want something that&#x27;s in the kit I would look for it in a Sallys or online and get that 1 item.</li>
    <li> What you get is the furthest thing from the description and the pictures. Never have I seen such low-quality items. They look cheap and they feel cheap. I&#x27;ve bought better quality items at the Dollar Store. Was it really a $60 value for $14?!?!?...Hmmm NO!!, More like a $1 value for $14. Let me explain each item:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Hairagami: Have you ever seen those wide looking wrist bands that look to be rigid but then you slap it them on your wrist and the curve around it? Well, it&#x27;s the exact same thing, except they&#x27;re 2 and they&#x27;re held together by the brown cloth (BTW you have no choice on the color, you get what you get). Anyway, you put your long hair in between the bands and you&#x27;re supposed to be able to roll your hair up and then curve the bands to form a bun, a sleek looking bun....Well, the reality is that you barely touch the bands and they immediately curve, so there&#x27;s no way to roll your hair because the moment you touch the darn things it&#x27;s all over. Chances are you&#x27;d have better luck trying to roll your hair with and actual wrist band thingy...Ughhh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Part Pizzaz: Please just go to the Dollar Store and get one, it&#x27;s ridiculous how flimsy it is. If you don&#x27;t hold it right it opens before you&#x27;re ready. Plus whoever made it, didn&#x27;t take it out of the mold right, so it has this plastic little bumps that snag your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The L&amp;eacute; Loom: Okay so, honestly this was the item I was looking forward to. It&#x27;s hard and time consuming to do a half pony tail thing while crossing locks of hair and putting bobby pins in place, but it looks nice and professional. So I was looking forward to making my job easier. Well, no such luck, we&#x27;ve established that the items look and feel cheap and this was no exception. The locks open by themselves as it is and then you go and add an inch of hair and it&#x27;s over. Gosh!! It makes me so mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The Hair Yoga: Yea, the 90&#x27;s called and they want their silly little hairstyles back. This item was whack, just look at the pictures!...But let&#x27;s just say you actually wanted to use it, well you can&#x27;t because once again the locks open by themselves. Add to that that you&#x27;re supposed to lock 1/4 of your hair into each one??! Well that&#x27;s just a bad joke from the manufacturers because it does not work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The Jing Tong Pony Holder: Whoever packaged this missed the memo because it was nowhere to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The Monkey-bands: It&#x27;s basically two hair mini-grabbie thingies joined together by a hair elastic band (you get two of these). The bands look like they&#x27;re about to rip at any moment and the mini-grabbie thingies might fall apart if you look at them wrong...&#x27;Nuff said&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The www.pins: Well, I was baffled by these and have no idea how to use them, they look flimsy and easily breakable. I didn&#x27;t bother with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. The Instruction cards: They&#x27;re more like picture mini-cards that show you how your hair is supposed to look like with the different items (except the www.pins, I&#x27;ve no idea why), they do have like 3 step instructions on some, and on others you clearly need more info but I guess they just assume you&#x27;ll know what to do. The ring like every item in this kit is cheap plastic and as you&#x27;re examining the cards it opens by itself and the cards fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. The Ziploc bag they came in looks like it was used 50 times and then I got it, it was ripped to begin with so I didn&#x27;t have to open it at the top, the items just sort of fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please DO Not Waste Your Time and Money buying this.whack, just look at the pictures!...But let&#x27;s just say you actually wanted to use it, well you can&#x27;t because once again the locks open by themselves. Add to that that you&#x27;re supposed to lock 1/4 of your hair into each one??! Well that&#x27;s just a bad joke from the manufacturers because it does not work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The Jing Tong Pony Holder: Whoever packaged this missed the memo because it was nowhere to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The Monkey-bands: It&#x27;s basically two hair mini-grabbie thingies joined together by a hair elastic band (you get two of these). The bands look like they&#x27;re about to rip at any moment and the mini-grabbie thingies might fall apart if you look at them wrong...&#x27;Nuff said&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.

    <li> I can&#x27;t use any of the hair pieces. I have thick hair so basically the set is pointless. If you have thin hair it might work.</li>
    <li> To anyone who has normal/thin hair: I&#x27;m sure this product will work great for you, and you can feel free to ignore this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To anyone who has thick hair: Ugh. This won&#x27;t work too well for your hair. I wish it wasn&#x27;t that way, but I have very thick hair and the product just seems to be a bit too flimsy/not geared toward thick hair.</li>
    <li> thi has everything but its not as easy as it looks good luck with it</li>
    <li> purchased through supplier website Not AMAZON. Product is economical for all the clips offered in the makeover kit. It takes a minute to get used to how to use them. They are not your simple clip or elastic band from the drug store. With patience and persistance they become easier to use, and after a bit they are second nature. I recomend this product. They will make your hair look good and people will notice it too.</li>
    <li> It takes a little practice with some of the tools in this kit but with most of them i got right away.For the price is amazing compared to what styles you can create!!!</li>
    <li> It said you get the travel bag as well and it was missing! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product if you expect to get everything that should be in the package.</li>
    <li> i was thrilled to try this product .when it came in the mail it  was packed securely. however when i opened the package ,the box containing the product was opened and contained only 3 pieces in it and, no BONUS travel.carrying case. i am very upset! i spent 10$ on something i could have found in better condition at a thrift store...and it probobly would be cheaper at a thrift store too! VERY DISSATISFIED! DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
    <li> I have waist-length straight hair. It broke one of the plastic items the second time I used it. The rest of the styles looked cute in the instructions, but my hair was too long to do most of them. I finally gave up on the kit and it&#x27;s sitting, unused, in my closet. Most of the styles were difficult to replicate by myself and I don&#x27;t have anyone who can style my hair on a regular basis. So...I&#x27;m back to ponytails. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I don&#x27;t know how many people still have a VHS player, but I was disappointed to see that they don&#x27;t offer a CD/DVD version of the instructions.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For someone with thinner, shorter hair I am sure this kit could do some cute stuff but if your hair is long or thick enough to put strain on ponytail holders and clips, it will probably strain (and eventually break) some of these tools as well.</li>
    <li> The second day I was using this product one of the handles broke off the tool that creates zig zags in your hair.  However, the concept is good.  The others products work well and the video is informative.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the travel case like it is supposed (as listed on the box) but so far everything else is great!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0007LE3EG The Total Hair Makeover Kit - 90001]]    Excellent Seller! Extremely fast shipping! (In fact it got here a day before other items I bought 2 days before buying this!!)  Exactly as described! Even provided an email thanking me for the purchase and another one when sent out, with a tracking number.   Item was exactly as described!  Definately one of my favorite sellers!   Thank you!!</li>
    <li> There are some cool hairstyles in here, but maybe I am just not very good at doing my hair because I can&#x27;t figure out how to use the stuff.</li>
    <li> I recieved clipss that broke on the first try, the directions were in russian and the main clip was a weird design when the description says black. They should not be allowed to sell on amazon[[ASIN:B0007LE3EG Total Hair Makeover Kit 90001]]</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very user friendly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a birthday present for my friend who is really into styling her hair. I had high expectations for the product but I must admit I was disappointed when I actually received the package. The hair accessories looked cheap and when I opened the box, it was to find all the contents in a ziplock bag, which I guess is the &amp;#34;travel case&amp;#34; to which the producers refer. My friend seemed to like her present but I still remain unimpressed by the packaging and the look of the items. I do not expect the accessories to last long. They appear to very flimsy indeed. The dvd was not even in a proper case, thereby making it easy for the other items to scratch it. All in all, I was not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> What is on the outside of the pkg is not what is on the inside!!!!!!!!!!! Much smaller/cheaper versions are included.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I had a great time playing with this kit. We were able to create some styles not shown on the box too!</li>
    <li> This kit gives you several pieces that give one many options for styling your hair.  I&#x27;ve been looking to learn how to learn more ways to style my hair, and with this it will be easier.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand it...I thought it&#x27;s nice...everything was cheaply made...I wasted money :-( ....The one that&#x27;s supposed to make a bun is already broken when i got it...i super hate this product...</li>
    <li> I was getting married and the lady that was supposed to do my hair and makeup backed out two weeks before my wedding. I liked the hairgami products that I have used in the past and needed one more piece to accomplish the look that I wanted. I was thrilled that I could get a kit with the piece that I needed and a few extras to play with later on. I have since watched the little dvd that came with it and tried out a few of the other looks, which take patience but look great once you figure them out. I liked this product and would recommend it to anyone that would like to move beyond scrunchies and ponytails everyday for work.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to try some new things out for my daughters hair. There were pieces missing from the box, and what was in there was really flimsy. The \\&quot;instruction cards\\&quot; were a joke. You could do much better with a box of bobby pins and some imagination. Don&#x27;t bother, this is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> First of all, the DVD in it is so old that it will not play on any type of new technology.  The instruction booklet is an overview, so that was no help.  I had to go to YouTube.  I still couldn&#x27;t get figure out what 1/2 of the items do, and the only one I did like was the monkey claws and they broke with in a month (they look easy enough to make on my own).  I would not recommend this to anyone, it is a waste of time and effort.  It so sad too, I remember see an infomercial years ago on this and always wanted it. So, so, so diaspointed.</li>
    <li> This item was missing some items and did not come as described, and was open when I received it. The bag they show and list in the description was not in our box. This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. It looked very cheap when I received it and the person I bought it for doesn&#x27;t even use it because the products did not seem to be as useful as it showed.</li>
