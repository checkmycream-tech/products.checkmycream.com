<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Better than the Calcium Bentonite formula.  More moisturizing and hydrating.  Curls pop like never before. I mix with warm water and olive oil and apply to moisturized hair.</li>
    <li> I love, love, Loooooooove this stuff!!! So, I used it as a hair detox instead of a facial mask. I mixed equal parts of the clay with apple cider vinegar and added a few of my favorite oils for a silky smooth finish. I then applied the mixture to my wet hair in the shower. After I applied the mixture to my hair and massaged it into my scalp, I place a plastic shower caps on my head and let it sit for about 30 minutes. As I was sitting I felt the clay on my scalp and it was tightening like it did on my face. It felt weird but I let it stay on. After the time was up I went to wash it out. some of the clay had dried in my hair and it was so hard to wash out. I felt like I was gonna lose some hair from rubbing it so hard.  After I washed it out, I instantly noticed how different my hair looked and felt. It felt clean without feeling stripped. I didn&#x27;t even have to deep condition my hair and I ALWAYS have to deep condition my hair. It&#x27;s amazing! My hair looked so much healthier after just one use.  I also used it on my face and had excellent results.While I did receive this product at a promotional rate, this experience is completely unbiased and is of my own. I&#x27;m definitely a satisfied customer and will purchase this bentonite clay again.</li>
    <li> Loooooooove this stuff!!! So, I used it as a hair detox instead of a facial mask. I mixed equal parts of the clay with apple cider vinegar and added a few of my favorite oils (coconut, lavender, rosehip and eucalyptus) to mask the scent and for a silky smooth finish. I then applied the mixture to my soaking wet hair in the shower. It&#x27;s so messy and I didn&#x27;t want to get it all over my sink and counters. After I applied the mixture to my hair and massaged it into my scalp, I place two plastic shower caps on my head (my hair is super thick and I have a lot of it so one cap didn&#x27;t work) and let it sit for about 30-45 minutes. As I was sitting I felt the clay on my scalp and it was tightening like it did on my face. It felt weird but I let it stay on. After the time was up I went to wash it out. This is where I had some trouble. Apparently some of the clay had dried in my hair and it was sooooooo hard to wash out. I felt like I was gonna lose some hair from rubbing it so hard. I finally got it all out, so I thought. Nope! Some residue was left around my hairline in the front. By the time I noticed it, I had already blow dried my hair so it was staying there lol. After I washed it out, I instantly noticed how different my hair looked and felt. It felt squeaky clean without feeling stripped. I didn&#x27;t even have to deep condition my hair and I ALWAYS have to deep condition my hair. It&#x27;s amazing! My hair looked so much healthier after just one use. At first I was so hesitant to use this in my hair even after hearing how great it was because I have extremely tightly curled hair. Now, I think this may replace my shampoo or at least be used as an alternative. While I did receive this product at a promotional rate, this experience is completely unbiased and is of my own. I&#x27;m definitely a satisfied customer and will purchase this bentonite clay again.</li>
    <li> This Bentonite Clay has many internal uses such as toothpaste, heartburn relief, colon cleanse, relief from constipation, relief from infection Bentonite Clay also can be used for baby diaper rash, burn cream, acne relief, clay face mask, wrinkle cream, hair conditioner, and many more. No fancy packaging just high quality bentonite clay.I&#x27;m so excited to start using this product.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this and try it out at such a great price, the seller nailed it with this product this has so many great benefits for the skin and the hair, and you don&#x27;t have to use water you can use apple cider vinegar to make the benefits even better, when you mix this up it is very smooth and creamy making the application easy to put on and rinse off it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your skin, this is also great to add to bath water it helps the body to detox, this was easy to mix up and easy to use for sure</li>
    <li> With a Mom who used clay masks for years, would you believe I&#x27;ve never tried one?! When I had the opportunity to receive this item in order to test and review, I thought &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34; I had read the other reviews, suggesting using coconut oil rather than water, so that&#x27;s what my 15yo daughter and I did. All I can say is amazing!!  Our faces felt so soft and clean afterwards! I also noticed smaller pores - yay! The only suggestion I have for the manufacturer is to put a sealing disc either on top of the jar before lidding, or someone how seal the lid closed. Our jar arrived with a loose cover and opened a cloud of clay went everywhere. :(</li>
    <li> This mask made my skin so soft until I’m seriously now addicted to Bentonite Healing clay. Only after its first use I could already tell how well this clay mask cleaned my face. Just as stated, it really does a deep cleanse into your pores because of its ability to produce an electrical charge. When hydrated, its electrical components changes, giving it the ability to vacuum out your pores and rid your face of toxins, impurities and oils. Once I’m out, I plan to get more. Highly Recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product! I love the fact that this is just a very simple product. It is 100% sodium bentonite and it has a shelf life of 5 years! This is probably one of the best ways to make a clay mask because there are not going to be a ton of chemicals going all over your skin. I love trying to do clay masks at least once a week. That&#x27;s why I wanted to try this but looking at the packaging it also suggests it being used in my hair! I can&#x27;t wait to try that. Again I think this is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try Bentonite Healing Clay for a while now as I have heard by many that they loved it!! When I received this Bentonite Healing Clay in the mail I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out for myself. After trying it out I have to say WOW what an amazing product!! It made my skin feel soft and rejuvenated!! This Bentonite Healing Clay does wonders at removing the impurities from your skin and leaving you with refreshingly clean skin!! This Bentonite Clay was also very easy to use and the directions are clearly listed out on the packaging, which is always nice to have in a product!! This product also didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, which is always a plus for me as someone with somewhat sensitive skin. I really loved this Bentonite Healing Clay by Cosmetics Derigueur and definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Made a fantastic difference in my skins appearance!</li>
    <li> Feels so good and works great good shipping</li>
    <li> This needs to be mixed with water and set aside for 20-30 minutes before use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for hair and face masks. I follow the directions for mixing with water and apple cider vinegar. Clay is very smooth. Conditions and detangles hair easily. Leaves hair and skin feeling soft and moisturized. Much, much better than Indian Healing Calcium Bentonite Clay which is quite drying.</li>
    <li> To over drying for my entire face. Works well for spot treatment.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair conditioner, I mixed the  Clay Powder with Water or Apple Cider Vinegar and Enjoy This Amazingly Gentle Cleanser and Curl Definer and my scalp never felt so good.  It has stopped the excessive hair shedding which I was experiencing every time I washed my hair.  I like to wear Quick Weaves which is when my hair is wrapped around in gel and dried hard as a brick and then hair is glued onto my head and cut in whatever style I like to keep from cutting my natural hair, so basically I wear a short hair do but I really have long hair.  Before I started washing my hair with this healing clay mixed with vinegar I cold not wear that style no more than 3 days before my scalp started to itch, now I can wear my quick weave hair dos up to 3-4 weeks without experiencing extreme scalp itching.  It word wonders.  I recommend this too anyone that has a lot of dandruff or someone that likes to wear hair dos that like I do.</li>
    <li> My jar of Bentonite Healing Clay arrived in the mail today. I could not wait to try it out! I measured 1/2 cup of the clay and poured 1/2 of water over it. You can use apple cider vinegar if you want as well. After 10 minutes you mix it together (I had to add more water). Then let it sit for 20-30 mins. After it was ready I talked my husband into trying it as well. I decided to use it as a face mask. There are TONS of other uses for it, just google it or look it up on Pinterest! We put it on our face and the bottom of our feet. Waited 10 minutes and then washed off with a face cloth and warm water. WOW. My face felt amazing. So smooth and soft. My husband loved it too! I am recommending it to my sister in law because my niece suffers from eczema and i know this will help out with that. Next time I use it I am going to use it in my hair. Can&#x27;t wait! Added to my beauty routine for sure.</li>
    <li> Once I got past the set up/directions, this was great. I&#x27;ve been using it as a mask once a week for over a month and my skin is really showing a difference. I have been getting fewer break out and my skin just feels tighter. I have since become a fan of mixing it up each use because I&#x27;ve been able to get an accurate idea of what I&#x27;ll actually use in one treatment.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bentonite clay for years, I really like the Cosmetics Derigueur clay. As a community herbalist, it is my go to for external urban detox; removal of all of the environmental chemicals I am in contact with. I use it for face, and hair masks, as well as in the tub. Upon receiving this clay, I mixed a hair mask with nettle tea, instead of water... and soaked in a tub, to which I also added 1/2 cup of this clay.... Heavenly! After rinsing with water, I rinsed my hair with 1/2 apple cider vinegar, 1/2 water. My super fine, limp hair feels fuller, and has a bit of body. My skin feels wonderfully soft and moisturized, not to mention a decrease in knee swelling and my skin has a pleasant warmness to it. I am not sure why, but I sleep incredibly well, after a clay bath! There is one drawback, and that is that the tub does take extra effort to clean, after a clay bath. I will still give 5 stars, because there is no way around that. I got this clay for a great price, but would gladly pay more</li>
    <li> Ive been looking to try this bentonite clay for a while, and then I was offered it at a great promotional price to review, so I couldn&#x27;t pass it up any longer! I have heard great reviews about it as a face mask and as I love all things skincare related I was eager to try it. I mixed it with Apple Cider Vinegar and put it on my face in a thin layer for the time recommended . It got super tight, but for me there wasn&#x27;t any tingling as other people have experienced. When I rinsed it off my pores felt really tight and cleansed, and my skin was very soft and smooth. My boyfriend used it too, but he put it on waaay too thick, so it took the both us about 15 minutes to get it all off haha. Make sure you don&#x27;t put it on in too thick a layer or its ridiculous to rinse!! I didn&#x27;t know you could use it on your hair, so I&#x27;m excited to try that as well! All in all this is a great product, and I will definitely buy again when the time comes. (Which probably won&#x27;t be for a long time, because a tiny bit is enough for your whole face, so this most likely is going to last forever!)</li>
    <li> Thank you for this amazing product.  I use this at least once a week and have noticed a drastic improvement on my skin.  My skin is brighter and much smoother.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review. I&#x27;ve used this on some areas of acne of my face and chest. I have very fair, sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t get a lot of breakouts, but when I do they are very noticeable because of my skin tone. I mixed a bit of this clay with water, dabbed a small amount of the &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; to the skin, left on about 20 minutes, and rinsed with water. The next day, the acne was nearly gone. I did the same on a spider bite, but left the paste on overnight. Same result the next day, and it took the itching away. I&#x27;ve had no reactions or irritation, but this is a bit drying. Use in moderation if you have dry skin. When you are ready to apply, make sure you have a sturdy plastic/glass bowl and spoon to mix with water. You can also mix with apple cider vinegar (probably best if using in your hair?) and extra virgin olive oil. I mixed with olive oil and left on my feet overnight. My calluses were much smoother and softer in the morning. Don&#x27;t use a metal blow or utensil. Metal somehow interferes with the effectiveness. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wood. It would probably be way too hard to clean. My hair is color-treated, so I can&#x27;t use it for deep cleansing. It can remove color. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking to do, this may be a comparable/healthier alternative to bleach washes. I haven&#x27;t tried, so this is just my &amp;#34;semi&amp;#34; educated opinion. I wish it came with an applicator and/or dispenser so you didn&#x27;t have to dig into the jar, or rub on your skin with your hands. It&#x27;s hard to get out from under your nails. Overall, I really liked this product and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I tried this clay powder for the first time tonight and although I was skeptical (I mean seriously... It&#x27;s mud!) I LOVE it! My skin feels amazing!</li>
    <li> Omg! I&#x27;ve never had a clay so amazing! Made my hair super soft and detangled hair as good as rhassoul clay does! I mixed it with milk, honey, olive oil, argon oil, and lavender essential oil. Smelt heavenly!  Will definitely buy from this company again. Oh it swells a lot, so a little goes a long ways!</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction to the product but have seen others achieve good results.</li>
    <li> Everyone says that I&#x27;m too young to worry about facials and creams. But, I didn&#x27;t get this clay for that. I wanted a detox. I have so many health problems, and I wanted to rid my body of as many of the bad chemicals as I could. I mixed the suggested 1/2 cup water and 1/2 clay powder in a plastic bowl with a plastic spoon (Metal is a no-no!) and let it sit for ten minutes. Then I stirred and let it sit for another ten minutes. Next, I applied it to my face, neck, and upper chest/shoulders. I hid in the bathroom, because I didn&#x27;t want my roomies to accuse me of being the &amp;#34;Mudman&amp;#34; or something. I felt a gentle tingle, but no itching. After ten minutes of drying, I rinced off the mask in the shower. My skin was softer and more lusterous. I couldn&#x27;t swear to the science of the ions of the clay attracting toxins from my skin, but I believe it after the results I had! I&#x27;m so proud to have done something so healthful and natural for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This can also be done to hair as a detox treatment, but never to colored hair.</li>
    <li> OkayI have to admit it I was skeptical about this product. I have never been the type to try something like this before. So,when I was offered a great price to try this out and give my opinion I was excited. I thought that it would have a bad smell to it but it doesn&#x27;t. You can use it as a mask by adding water or apple cider vinegar.Also you could add your favorite oil to the mix.So I am now a believer that it works.It feels funny when drying on your face (looks funny too) but after you let it sit for about 20 minutes and wash it all off,wow your face feels so much better.This product you can use in many ways.Don&#x27;t forget to try it on your hair.Be careful if your hair is dyed,it can remove the color.If I can use this product you can too.Go ahead and give it a try!</li>
    <li> Good healing powder clay. My skin feels and looks clear, clean and refreshed after I use it. I&#x27;m all about natural healing and remedies and this is a good product to have.  I recommend it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It seriously mkes my face feel AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited I bought it...my boyfriend would kill me if he knew I told you- but he cant wait to use it again. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell or odor. The only thing is DO NOT rinse it off in a bathroom sink- it is a pain to get down the drain. Also, the directions say to mix 1/2 cup of mix with 1/2 cup of water... I have gotten both my boyfriend and my face completely coated with 3 or 4 tablespoons!</li>
    <li> I have heard nothing but good things about bentonite clay masks.  I had the opportunity to purchase this at a promotional price and could not resist the amazing opportunity to try it!  When I first got the product in, I did not quite understand the instructions about mixing it and letting it sit.  I had to do a little bit of internet research.  I ended up mixing mine with apple cider vinegar.  I applied to my face and I have used it twice so far.  My skin feels soft and looks rejuvenated!  There is no better feeling than going into work and hearing &amp;#34;You look great, did you do something new?&amp;#34;  As oppose to &amp;#34;You look tired today, are you feeling ok?&amp;#34;  I highly recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> Pros: Creates Healthy Look; Effective; Easy To Take; Good Value&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Causes Side Effects&lt;br /&gt;This is the best mask I have ever used!!! For the best results its best to follow the directions by using the equal amount of powder and vinegar (or water). I prefer a thinner texture and build it up with two coats when applied with a foundation brush. It dries quickly and does what it says it will do, PULL OUT THOSE TOXINS! My face has never felt so clean or looked so good! I did have 1 small acne breakout on one side of my face after my second use, however by the 3rd use (7 day intervals) I was back to clear skin. I am also currently drinking ACV on a daily basis, so my breakout may have been caused by my body&#x27;s detoxification process. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> This stuff is definately a dupe for the OTHER famous healing clay that is out there. I love this stuff, I think that its great for my oily skin, and its gentle and does the trick. Great for clearing up acne.</li>
    <li> I was offered to review this product with a promotion and to remain completely unbiased. I was expecting this to be a hard clay, so when I opened it up, powder went flying! It does do its job, but it makes a mess.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing - It did take me a while to get the mixture right but although that was my lack of knowledge - it was the only con I have to say about this product. I received an offer to test this product during a review for an price and I am absolutely in love with the natural ways to care for my body/skin.&lt;br /&gt;Bentonite Clay is a unique clay due to its ability to produce an “electrical charge” when hydrated. Upon contact with fluid, its electrical components change, giving it the ability to absorb toxins. Bentonite is known for its ability to absorb and remove toxins, heavy metals, impurities, and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this in my bath - to assist in absorbing the toxins that I deal with on a regular basis. In my opinion this is a fast and simple way to detox. However there are other uses for this clay:&lt;br /&gt;*On the Skin: Externally, Apply a paste of bentonite clay and water on any skin irritation like blemishes, insect bites, cuts, skin itching, or burns. Leave it on until it dries and wash off. This is said to be especially calming to skin itching from eczema, psoriasis, chicken pox, etc.&lt;br /&gt;*Skin Poultice for Bites/Burns/Cuts/Stings: For more severe issues, I create a poultice by putting a thick layer of clay on the skin and applying a wet gauze or cloth over it. I wrap the area and leave the poultice on, changing every 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;*Face Mask: For smooth and healthy skin, make a paste of bentonite and water and apply to my face as a mask (a similar mask is used in many spas). I leave on for 20 minutes and wash off. I typically do this once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;*Detox Bath (One of my favorite methods): I sometimes add about 1/4 cup of Bentonite Clay to a bath for a relaxing detox bath that softens skin.&lt;br /&gt;*For Oral Health: Because of it’s excellent ability to bind to heavy metals and toxins as well as to provide minerals, I use Bentonite Clay in my Remineralizing Tooth Powder Recipe. It can even be used alone for brushing and is tasteless and relatively textureless.&lt;br /&gt;Oral Rinse to whiten and remineralize teeth: Besides use the the tooth powder, I use Bentonite mixed with water as an alkalizing and toxin removing mouth rinse. I mix 1/2 teaspoon of clay in 1/4 cup water in a small jar with a plastic lid and shake well. Then, I rinse with the water for 1-2 minutes and repeat until I’ve used it all.&lt;br /&gt;*For Mastitis: I’ve created a poultice or mask of Bentonite Clay and water and applied externally to the area. I repeat as needed every hour until the infection is gone. I also take internally during infection.&lt;br /&gt;*For Baby Powder: Plain Bentonite Clay makes a very soothing baby powder for use when there is infection or redness. It can also be made into a clay “mask” to help speed recovery in this area.&lt;br /&gt;*For Morning Sickness: I took 1/2 tsp of Bentonite Clay in water during early pregnancy to ward off morning sickness. It helped with the nausea and helped me feel better. Check with your doctor or medical professional before using during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;*Internal Cleansing: I drink 1/2 to 1 teaspoon most days in a cup of water. I combine in a glass jar with a plastic lid and shake until well incorporated. This has helped improve my digestion and also seems to give me more energy. Since adding this and getting gelatin in my diet or through Gelatin powder daily I also notice that my nails and hair grow more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;*For Pets: For pets that are sick, vomiting or showing signs of illness, you can add Bentonite to their water or mix and give orally with a dropper or syringe without the needle. I have read cases of Bentonite and other healing clays being used internally to help reduce radiation exposure, in alternative cancer treatments, and in MRSA infections. It is also said to greatly help in Parasite removal, though I have not tried this personally.eless and relatively textureless.&lt;br /&gt;Oral Rinse to whiten and remineralize teeth: Besides use the the tooth powder, I use Bentonite mixed with water as an alkalizing and toxin removing mouth rinse.

    <li> I like this a lot. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin. Great purchase!! I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
    <li> **In order to offer my 100% honest opinion I was offered this item at discounted rate for the purpose of reviewing it.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always a little nervous when using products on my face for the first time because my skin is sensitive so when using this I mixed with water to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t give me a rash and was pleasantly surprised when I didn&#x27;t have any adverse reactions and my skin felt soft and clean.  I can&#x27;t believe how after just a few days, my skin looks much cleaner and brighter than using my old products.  My pores look smaller and my face is less oily throughout the day and I owe it all to this product. It is worth every penny and lasts for 5 years.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new face cleanser.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I have ever tried Bentonite Healing Clay. I can say I absolutely loved this product!  I used it as a facial mask.  I felt like I was at the spa.  A true feeling of deep cleaning without over drying the skin.  I also had a few small red patches on my face which have subsided.</li>
    <li> I have been starting to give myself facials and was looking forward to trying this Bentonite Healing Clay. I received a promotional discount so that I can provide my opinion and honest feedback. When I went to open the jar some of the powder did fall out but that was no big deal considering the results I received after using the Bentonite Clay. Just added water and followed directions on the jar. While applying the clay to my face it went on smoothly and easily and there was no irritation. I left it on face for 10 minutes and it washed off easily with warm water. I was very pleased with how my skin looked after using it. I have used it several times now and my pours look smaller and face looks healthier. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend the Bentonite Clay.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my face feel..tightens my pores and makes my face super smooth..</li>
    <li> This is a Great product. Easy to work with. Really notice beautiful results</li>
    <li> More moisture than the calcium bentonite clay</li>
    <li> It pulls out the toxins in my skin! Fewer breakouts!</li>
    <li> I use this as a calming bath for my 4 month old with eczema. Works great in relieving the itchiness and redness. A little messy but cleans up fine with some extra rinses.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I mix it with a little apple cider vinegar as a mask for my face, and it really does heal and make my face look great!</li>
    <li> I washed my hair with this tonight and my hair responded very well! I did not mix it, according to the package, so it wasn&#x27;t very thick. I added olive oil, lavender oil, and aloe juice. I shook it up in a squirt bottle and applied it. My hair is thick and chemical free. I have a new shampoo. I am VERY pleased. The lavender gives my scalp a nice tingle and the clay cleansed without stripping my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes my hair feel squeaky clean and fresh</li>
    <li> awesome clay mask worked wonder on my face that breaks out all the time my face felt rejuvinated and felt like new afterwards</li>
    <li> I am very happy to try this bentonite healing clay, you can use it in many things like skin, hair, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my hair and let me tell you something I love love love how my hair looks after. It looks shiny and soft, I&#x27;ll be using it as a face mask too I bet my face with look shiny. This clay is really good for skin acne so I&#x27;ll be telling every one about it.Try it!</li>
    <li> Big jar of this! The clay works wonder on my face. It seems to dry up any acne I have as well. Tightens my face although I am young.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about having an opportunity to use this product. When the healing clay  came I was impressed with the container it came in. After further inspection of the container I noticed that it contained an ingredient to which I am allergic to. I really wanted to try this product because of the positive comments about the clay. However, due to my skin being sensitive to the only ingredient in the clay, I cannot use the product. I would suggest trying this product if you do not have sensitive skin like mine. I just hate that I did not realize the ingredient sooner.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and so I have to be really careful about what products I use. Due to this I did not use this as a mask on my face, however, if you do use it as a mask on your face mix it with raw organic apple cider as that will cut down on the redness. I have been looking for a good skin detoxification product and I jumped at the chance to be able to purchase this product at a promotional price to share my experience with it here with you. I first combined ½ cup of the Bentonite Clay and ½ cup of water. I let it sit for 10 minutes and then stirred it together. I than let it sit for another 20 minutes to let the clay soak up as much of the water as it could. I than applied it to my feet and arms. I let it dry for about 20 minutes and washed it all off in a bubble bath. The clay came off really easy with minimal scrubbing. There was some redness on my arms but that went away after about an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask felt so good on my skin! I felt like I was at the spa getting a special mud treatment! The product is really great and does what it claims. I love that it is made in the USA! This product comes with a 90 day guarantee so you have no worries when making a purchase. It’s a product that I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel super soft and helped clear impurites. It&#x27;s amazing for hair as well. I do a clay wash every 3 days and it makes my hair extremely soft and shiny. Also detangles it as I have 4B/C hair. Must. Get. More!</li>
    <li> Where do I begin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT IN HIGH QUANTITY</li>
    <li> Decreased pores, skin softer and seems firmer, i added a little extra water in the mix and let it set before applying, it was a little weird applying to my face but I had no problems with it on. Came off without a problem as well.  I haven&#x27;t tried this in my hair as a masque yet, but am eager to see how that helps my hair! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I mixed with Apple cider Vinegar. I notice my face feels smoother after using this item one time. I have heard wonderful things about Bentonite Clay and I have always wanted to use it and now I have.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this came in powder form.Love it for my hair and skin</li>
    <li> This was surprisingly fun because you make mud. Mixing a little water and Bentonite Clay Powder made mud and a nice facial.  It felt very spa like to have mud on my face.  Afterwards I had no doubt that my face was clean down to the pores. I recommend this product. Facials are such a nice way to pamper yourself.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my bentonite clay powder.  I was skeptical at first as to how well it would work with my skin.  I have tried several products recently to clear up my adult acne.  Many of them made me break out even worse (UGH).  This clay seems to be reversing the damage I have done to my poor facial skin.  I have noticed my skin is definitely smoother, and the acne is slowly fading away.  I am so very glad I purchase it when I was offered the promotion!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. My skin feels clean and bright after using it. Will recommend to friend and family.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of fun using this mask with my husband. I love facials and masks and use them weekly. I chose to make our with apple cider vinager instead of water and got a pleasant tingling affect. left our faces feeling clean and we were both relaxed.</li>
    <li> Creamy, smooth, easy to mix. Leaves my hair clean but not stripped. I tried other brands of sodium bentonite and found it drying. Just when I was about to switch to rhasoul clay I decided to give this a try.  Very pleased. I love mixing essential oils in and creating a product that works for me.</li>
    <li> A very nice large jar and quick shipping too!</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> I am from India and I am using clay(Multani mitti) on my face since I was a teenager.I have oily skin and it&#x27;s a really effective and easy way to remove all oiliness and impurities from your skin.It even reduces pores and minimizes pimples.I used to love them and really used to miss it when I shifted to US.Recently I got the opportunity to try them at discounted price in exchange of my honest opinion and they reminded me of the clay I used to use at my home.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easily to use, you just have to soak clay with some water for around 15 mins and then apply it on your face.I like to mix equal quantity of sandalwood powder with my clay and wet it with rose water rather then normal water.After using it I have to say I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in 16oz box which is gonna last for more then 6 months if used only on face and will last for around 2 month if use as hair mask depending on your hair length.Please don&#x27;t use it more then once a week on your face it tends to dry the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Soak it with apple cider vinegar to use it as hair mask.It does clean your hair very effectively but I always feel like my hair tend to get too dry after using it so I always use hot oil on my hair first before washing it with this clay.&lt;br /&gt;In short it very effective for oily skin, works great just don&#x27;t over use it otherwise your skin will feel too dry.I got this at discounted price in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Worthwhile... Met my expectations</li>
    <li> Product appeared to have been open, taped together and no receipt was included.</li>
    <li> Now I tend to follow some trends.. guilty.. and I had started to hear of Bentonite Clay, and to be honest I use henna hair dye so I&#x27;m pretty used to rubbing mudd on my head, but my husband came home early after I had applied this as a face masque to try to treat some horrible planets that have decided to align on my forehead and even trying to minimize the appearance of pores.. he took one step inside the house looked at me (from the front door way) and walked back out.. Came back in a second later and said and I quote &amp;#34;i thought this was swamp things house&amp;#34;... SO this mask wont get you awards for Beauty Queen while its on, but once you rinse it off you skin will feel so smooth! I loved it!  My skin is soft without feeling dry, and it seems to have cleared up a few of my blackheads on my nose,&lt;br /&gt;I read one review about it possibly helping with Psoriasis, my son has psoriasis and I might talk to my doctor about trying this to see if it will help him out.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, and I am looking forward to unlocking the other uses for this especially as a hair treatment!!  :)</li>
    <li> I had to get this when I was offered it for at promotional rate. My daughter has psoriasis on her face and scalp and I had heard this was good for psoriasis as well as beneficial for many other skin and hair ailments as well.&lt;br /&gt;I had to read the directions and did some research as to how to mix this for the hair compared to using it on her face. It was pretty easy to do once I got the hang of it. It takes a small amount of time to mix it, it can be a little bit messy but the benefits are so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I used equal parts clay and water for her face and she left it on for about 20 minutes. The redness and scaling from her psoriasis is starting to subside and hopefully with more applications will be completely gone soon. She said this Bentonite Clay did not burn her face at all or irritate it like some products she had used in the past. Some creams and lotions she was using would make her face more red and would make her face burn with irritation.&lt;br /&gt;We then mixed equal parts clay with equal parts water and I added 10 drops of peppermint oil for her hair. She applies it to her hair and left it on, covered with a shower cap for a half hour. She rinsed it out, which was easier than I thought and her hair is so soft and beautiful and her scalp is starting to actually heal. She had such bad itchy, dry scaly areas that they would start to bleed. Hopefully after multiple uses with this clay mask on her hair and scalp she will not suffer any more. It did not seem to burn or irritate her scalp at all and it did leave her hair in better condition than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;This Premium Bentonite Clay really does seem to be healing her psoriasis problem. It does not stink, like the coal tar she was using.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from psoriasis or eczema problems or any other skin ailments.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with some issues with my skin for a while. I have some reoccurring blackheads around my nose &amp; some redness as well. I first heard about Bentonite clay as a useful remedy for this a couple of years ago. So, I have tried this in the past from a local store. I prefer to order from Amazon as the delivery is faster and I got this through a  promotion. I prefer this one to the one I used in the past, for several reasons. I appreciate that it is made/manufactured in the USA. I also learned something new on the packaging itself. I had no idea how the clay worked - and on the back of this container it explains how it works to detox through magnetic effects of it - pulling out toxins or drawing them out. I found that very interesting and useful. My son is highly sensitive to mercury and heavy metals and has Tourettes and I have used this clay on him in the bath. He loves it. And, I know it helps him. When he has a flare up of tics from the TS, sometimes it is from mercury in some fish he has had or something else that his body reacts to negatively. This helps for him at those times. For me, I prefer to mix it with Apple Cider Vinegar. I learned on this package that you should allow it to sit in the liquid for 20 or 30 minutes before using it. I never knew that from my past experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I apply it to my face and let it fully dry and get really tight. Afterwards, I wash it off carefully with a hot wash cloth - patting certain areas with the hot water in the cloth and then wiping it away. Afterwards, my skin is so fresh and pores seem invisible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps me a lot as a maintenance skincare product - to keep the pores under control and to get rid of blackheads. It really helps me with that. The only downside for me, personally, is that I have really dry skin and need to not use this more than once a week or it will exacerbate that. So, I am assuming, if you have oily skin that is could help a lot at regulating that. If anyone has any questions, you can ask me as I am on here a lot!uestions, you can ask me as I am on here a lot!</li>
    <li> This product says you can use vinegar or water to mix the clay with. I used water to mix it with. You have to put the clay and water together and let it sit for a specific amount of time then mix it very good. You put your hair up or clip it back depending on the length of your hair my hair is short so I clipped my hair back in place out of my face. Once your face is uncovered from all hair you place the clay on your face for ten minutes. All you have to use is some water and a soft wash cloth to clean the mask off your face within a ten minute time frame. I have sensitive skin so I had a small allergic reaction but no everyones skin is sensitive so it could still work for you. Other than the small allergic reaction my skin felt so soft finally not so oily because I deal with oily skin also. I couldn&#x27;t use it in my hair because my hair is dyed but if your hair isn&#x27;t dyed it&#x27;s perfect for you to use in your hair.</li>
    <li> Bentonite clay is a wonderful clay that I love. It has soo many uses and anyone can benefit from it. This was easy to mix with water after letting it sit and it didn’t stay very clumpy, I actually got it to form a great paste. It wasn’t too messy and was easy to handle in my hands and when mixing without getting it all over the place When using this on hair, I put it on, let it sit for about 30 minutes and rinsed and it out. It all washed out very easily and seemed to cleanse my hair and scalp very nicely and it was gentle. There wasn’t any residue left over on my hair and it left my curls shiny, bouncy and frizz free. When used as a face mask, it made my skin more firm and much softer and smoother. My usually oily skin was less oily and looked fresher. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bentonite clay has so many uses to it. It can be used for your hair as well as for your skin. When I was offered a great promotional price for this product I jumped at the offer. I personally wanted this item to use for my hair as I had heard about and seen the results of Bentonite Clay through the natural hair groups that I belong in. I have thick 4-something hair and I used this clay to make a clarifying mask to gently cleanse my hair and define my curls. Honey when I tell you, when I rinsed this stuff out, my curls were popping!!!!! I also have been dealing with extremely dry skin this winter as well, so I saved a little of the mud that was left for my hair and slathered it on my hands for a few minutes as well. I did not get to leave that on as long as I did in my hair, so I did not get a chance to see the full results, but I could feel it tingling on my skin and it felt like it was lifting the impurities away. I have also looked up some recipes for a mud facial and cannot wait to try that next. If you are not that ambitious, however, there are simple instructions right on the container for a simple mud mask. And remember, a little goes a long way with this stuff!</li>
    <li> This clay product is really awesome to use on your face probably 1-2 times a week. After using it at night, I felt my skin feeling soft, vibrant and rejuvenate using this clay product. I have very oily skin and this helps it a lot with my acne as well as to narrow my spores. I am also trying this on my significant and he loves it a lot too. It&#x27;s not expensive and really easy to use and apply on your skin. Each container can be used up to 4-5 times (1/2 cup for 2 person each time of use). With me, It just like having a spa visit at home. I purchased this product at promotional cost and will again.</li>
    <li> When I first read about this product I thought I just had to have it! I was able to get it during a promotion and am so happy I did as this stuff is wonderful! I do not have sensitive skin so things rarely bother me and this stuff left my face feeling soft and smooth. It&#x27;s a powder, which I am not use to using so I made quite a mess. I mixed it with a little bit of apple cider per the instructions, slathered it all over my face and neck, then sat back and relaxed. I really enjoyed it as a face mask and know how to use it better now so I no longer make a huge mess. This is a great product and I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I used the vinegar with it and my face felt so nice afterwards. I was so excited to get to review this product and now I am even more excited to get to use it all of the time! If you struggle with acne this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly. My skin seemed very bright and soft after use! I will definitely keep using this.I would recommend following up with a moisturizer after using though. Also, you don&#x27;t need. 1/2 cup for a single mask. A few spoon fulls is plenty!!</li>
    <li> Smells really good to me, I was worried it&#x27;d smell like mud or just earthy but it&#x27;s a really lovely scent. Cleanses and detoxifies amazingly well. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> always wanted to try this heard great things about it. I used it in a detox bath and got out feeling very relaxed and great loved it will definatly buy again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping - great size! Perfect item!</li>
    <li> This healing clay is a wonderful mask!  It&#x27;s very easy to mix and use and it&#x27;s great for mommy/daughter spa days.</li>
    <li> After using this product I can subtract 3-5 other products I had to used in combination to maintain my hair/skin regimen...this is all I need &amp; nice to know what I am using &amp; its not harmful too! My hair was softer &amp; less dull &amp; my husband didnt know i had used it &amp; told me my skin felt so soft! Very good product!</li>
    <li> Great stuff My skin feels great and I feel like Im glowing. A must have item for your facial collection</li>
    <li> Great product. Left my skin soft and smooth. Will be purchasing more for gifts.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used this as a mask for my face. I bought this based on others reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did. My skin looks and feels so much better. I don&#x27;t typically apply any kind of mask to my face but knew I really needed to. I&#x27;m going to continue to apply to my face weekly and try it out on my hair.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with Bentonite Clay after reading about it for a long time, it was offered to me at a discounted rate in return for my honest unbiased opinion. The powder was grey in color (which according to google is a good thing, it means its authentic) and it is very fine. It has an ionic charge which is how it draws out toxins and metal within the body so don&#x27;t use anything metal. I used a ceramic bowl and plastic spoon to mix it. The instructions stated 1/2 cup of powder and 1/2 cup of water, initially let it sit unmixed, mix at 10 minute mark then sit for another 30 minutes. I used two teaspoons of powder and ended up using total of three teaspoon of water and that was PLENTY for both my husband and I (yes, I tortured the poor guy). I ended up storing it in a little plastic container, that&#x27;s supposed to keep for a few months if I don&#x27;t double dip according once again to google. I&#x27;ll use it on my feet tonight to &amp;#34;draw out the toxins&amp;#34;. For me, I found that I had a difficult time mixing the clay, it came out clunky and uneven, which meant that as I applied it to my face, there were chunks in the masks, which didn&#x27;t really bother me too much. I watched a video where they suggested blending it and it looked like it came out much smoother. However, my spoon was a bit clunky so I will try a wooden popsicle stick to make it easier to blend and squish. Otherwise, as the mask was drying, it felt like it was SUCKING MY FACE off, which I took to mean that it was working at drawing all the toxins out (don&#x27;t suggest eating with this mask on, can&#x27;t really move your mouth). It wasn&#x27;t painful but you can&#x27;t really make facial expressions and it was just a weird sensation. I washed off the mask after it was fully dried in a circular motion and immediately felt that my skin was much smoother. It also felt really tight so I rubbed some pure coconut oil on which relieved the tightness sensation. My husband&#x27;s face turned red after washing it off but apparentlythat means that the mask drew the blood supply to the surface to suck the toxins out. His face returned to normal in the morning. Mine didn&#x27;t turn red so I don&#x27;t know what that means. :) Otherwise, seems to be authentic, and it does match up with what to expect when using high quality Bentonite clay and makes my skin really smooth.</li>
    <li> Getting this product at a low price for my review really helped. I have never heard of Bentonite Healing Clay before so I figured I would give it a try. I followed the directions and let it sit. I used it on my face and it really helped make my skin feel cleaner and better. My pores felt like they got smaller. ANd my husband used this on his dry rough feet and he said it helped his feet as well. I am going to keep using this once a week.</li>
    <li> Several people had recommended I try bentonite clay and I am glad a friend gave me a chance to try this product. As a first warning do not mix this clay onto something metal, it will decrease the effectiveness of the clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this clay for a few things now. Initially I bought it to heal a burn that left a red mark, a pretty large red mark. It&#x27;s been working on that. I&#x27;ve also started using it on my chin which has helped with the discoloration and blackheads that i thought were permanent dark marks of pores that constantly got blackheads. My chin is clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as a foot detox as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best though, I used this on a boil, and it drew out the gross stuff right away. This will be my go to for boils, as well as bug bites. This works way better than calamine lotion on bug bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some info about bentonite incase you don&#x27;t know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Mountain Rose Herbs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Bentonite, also referred to as Montmorillonite, is one of the most effective and powerful healing clays. Bentonite can be used externally as a clay poultice, mud pack or in the bath and, in skin care recipes. A good quality Bentonite should be a grey/cream color and anything bordering “pure white” is suspect. It has a very fine, velveteen feel and is odorless and non-staining. The type of bentonite offered by Mountain Rose herbs is a Sodium Bentonite.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bentonite Clay is composed of aged volcanic ash. The name comes from the largest known deposit of Bentonite Clay located in Fort Benton, Wyoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Bentonite is a swelling clay. When it becomes mixed with water it rapidly swells open like a highly porous sponge. From here the toxins are drawn into the sponge through electrical attraction and once there, they are bound.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bentonite clay carries a strong negative charge which bonds to the positive charge in many toxins. When it comes in contact with a toxin, chemical, or heavy metal, the clay will absorb the toxin and release it’s minerals for the body to use. Bentonite also helps get oxygen to cells as it pulls excess hydrogen and allows the cells to replace it with oxygen instead.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest reviewwill absorb the toxin and release it’s minerals for the body to use. Bentonite also helps get oxygen to cells as it pulls excess hydrogen and allows the cells to replace it with oxygen instead.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review</li>
    <li> I mix this with acv and use it for a mask to help my pores</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Leaves my skin and hair smooth and clean, just like all the impurities were all gone! Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Not a bad clay but I like Redmonds Clay better for my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this clay to as a hair cleanser.  It works best if you mix the clay in a glass bowl with a wooden, plastic or rubber spoon.  Let the clay sit and absorb the water prior to mixing.  I made the mistake of adding it to a bottle of water and shaking the bottle to mix.  It took a lot of clay to thicken.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel great after use</li>
    <li> We are a family that has 5 girls, 3 of whom are teens, and we use all natural products, and prefer to use USA sourced products, so when I was offered the chance to review this American  product at a great price, I was quite anxious to see its results.  I remember as a teen using a mud mask and this sounded similar, but in a healthier, more natural form.  The Bentonite Clay did not let me down!  After only one use, it has their skin smooth with the dry areas and oily areas evened out.  Each had a healthy glow, too.  They love the way it feels and are planning to try it on their hair next.  I&#x27;m thankful we found a product that will help them through the teen years and probably beyond.  I highly recommend this product for everyone!</li>
    <li> It took longer to set up then and get it ready to use then it does i feel like this item is very unnecessary! 20 mins til you can use it then it has to set on your hand for another 10 mins... just takes way to long!</li>
    <li> This momma is tired...and has neglected herself for TOO LONG!  For the past few years, the closest thing to pampering myself that I have done is when I used my lip balm twice in one day...ha! When I was in my early 20&#x27;s, I used to have a couple of friends over and we&#x27;d do masks and manicures and such, and given my extreme need of a facial, I was excited to receive the Bentonite Healing Clay to try out.  My skin is thankful!  When I opened the jar of clay, I expected to see a ready to apply product, however, it is a powder.  No big deal.  I just had to mix it with warm water and let sit for a bit.  Note--be sure to mix it up well, otherwise it will be all clumpy and harder to evenly apply.  I would have loved to do my mask before bed, when I&#x27;d have a little privacy, but I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out after receiving it, so I did it during the day with my little audience of one--my 2 year old son.  He thought it was hilarious as I wiped this brown goo on my face. He wanted to touch it, so I spent much of the 30 minutes walking around the house.  Let me tell you--as it started to dry, my skin felt amazing.  It took a bit longer to dry than I expected, but again, no big deal.  It suggests wearing it for up to 30 minutes anyway.  I was able to wash it off fairly easily with warm water and a wash cloth.  After patting my face dry, I was excited to feel my skin....it was so smooth.  And felt firmer.  And looked brighter.  Bentonite Healthing Clay, where have you been these past few years?  This momma has needed you :)</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used. Really made my skin feel marvelous. Can not say enough about it.</li>
    <li> I was excited to see that the bentonite clay had arrived since I have been looking into more natural products for myself and my family. I had read about this type of clay and thought “Hey we can use this” and so after I have used it on every member in my house. My daughter had her face break out due to stress so I mixed up a mask and slathered her with it. After leaving it on her face for 15 minutes she rinsed and within a few hours the redness from the break out started to clear up and in the morning her face looked even better. Needless to say everyone else got to wear the mask the next day just so I could test this on all skin types. I did find that it did slightly irate my husband’s skin but not enough that he was concerned about it. Personally I think his face had never had a mask on it before so it didn’t know how to act. Overall I am very pleased with the outcome so far and I am planning on giving the hair mask that is suggested on the container a try. I am so happy I got to review this product and found it to have the benefits I had read about online before getting it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It has so many uses. I love using is as a mask. You can mix it with water and use add in for a special skin treat. I also like to use it on my feet. It makes everything you put it on so soft and smooth. Bentonite is known for its ability to absorb and remove toxins, impurities, and chemicals. so sometimes I just pour some in the bath for a nice detox. This is awesome stuff! Great for your body and skin! I recommend it! *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> Lately I have been hearing a lot about bentonite clay and it&#x27;s cleansing properties. It has the ability to draw out impurities in the skin and hair. That;s why when I got the opportunity to be sent this and try it out, I was so happy to be able to write a review. You can use this product for a skin mask, a hair mask, or my favorite, as toothpaste (which sounds weird but I mean it, is so much better for you than floride toothpaste). The clay is finely milled and powdery with no scent, which is nice. After using it, I have seen my face glow so much! If you are looking for a more natural face mask, i would definitely try this.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of a healing clay. When I was given a promotion for this I first decide to do some research. The review looked good so I decided to order. I have only use it on my face so far and I love it. My skin felt soo soft and brigther. It makes me want to try it on my hair and am planning to try tomorrow.  Will first do a little more research to see how often I could use it on my face or in my hair so I won&#x27;t over do it. But super happy that I got this product. Would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> Masks are amazing for skin care and I was excited to try the Bentonite Healing Clay mask. I was able to try it at a promotional rate and wanted to share my experience with it. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled that it takes a bit to be able to use it as you have to mix the powder with water or apple cider before applying it, but I guess I just wanted instant gratification. You don&#x27;t have to wait long and for me the results were worth the time ,but be aware there is a wait. The mask can be applied to the face or hair, but as I have color treated hair it is not recommended for me to use on my hair. I applied it to the skin and left in on a little bit ( maybe 10 mins the first time). I placed a warm cloth across my face when removing it and took then took it off in a circular motion, following up with moisturizer. The next day my skin was more radiant and had a nice glow to it. I plan to use this again next week and hope for the same results.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned being that I have sensitive skin and others had a reaction but after doing a test patch I tried this on a really nasty zit and some unbroken skin. The zit was definitely down the next morning a little bit but still red. The mixing instructions were easy to follow but it is supposed to sit 20minutes and I didn&#x27;t leave it that long so that could be why the effect wasn&#x27;t so pronounced. The mud felt luxurious and very thick after I mixed it. On the unbroken skin my skin was quiet soft afterwards, no redness or irritation. It actually felt like a really good face mask when it was on - a little drying but washed off easily. My skin seemed a little less greasy for the couple of days afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is huge - it&#x27;s going to take me forever to finish this so it was really good value, especially since I got it on a promotion. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet as a mask but I will soon. I think perhaps if I have the time to mix it and let it sit longer it might give better healing results.</li>
    <li> I love it! I got it in the time I was guaranteed and it&#x27;s a great size,  it&#x27;s gonna last me a long time.  I&#x27;ve been using it as a mask right now but I can&#x27;t wait to try it for other things!</li>
    <li> Nice face mask! I color my hair, so the only thing I can use this for us my skin. I followed the instructions and mixed equal parts of clay powder and water. The instructions say to use a half cup of each. I think that was too much! I added more water because it was hard to mix. The instructions say to use plastic or wood bowls and utensils- I used a plastic soon, and I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t a cheap disposable one, because it would have snapped! Also the half cup of powder produced a lot of clay for my purposes- I would start with a couple of tablespoons at most next time.  Edited to add: now that I&#x27;ve used it more, I can say how much I love this mask. I take care of my skin, I get regular facials, I use quality products, I do mini home facials.. This mask adds nicely to my skincare routine. It has helped head off break outs and clear up blemishes. Even my boyfriend has started using this mask a few times a week!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Bentonite Clay and I am comparing this to another Bentonite Clay I reviewed recently - Indian healing clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is that this clay was easier to mix. I mixed it with water and not apple cider vinegar. Many people who have used the clay say it irritated their skin when using the vinegar. Once again I used the clay for many things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stared with a face mask. I had purposely not used any special products on my face for approximately 3 days before receiving this product. I simply washed my face with plain soap and water and used coconut oil to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay did irritate my skin when left on for the total time recommended. I expected this to happen because I have very sensitive skin. I do this in order to let you know that if you have sensitive skin follow those directions. Use plain water and leave on less time and you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used the 2nd time I had no issues with any irritation to my face. My skin felt smooth and clean. I had no acne outbreak as some report. If you do it is because it is pulling all the toxins and impurities out of your skin. Be patient and keep using it according to directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this in my hair and it removed all the build-up from shampoo, conditioner and products I use. It left my scalp feeling clean and it was not itchy anymore. This tends to happen when I have build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other ways I used it -- as hand mask, on my elbows which are rough and it helps keep them smooth. I use this in a foot soak and it softens the bottom of my feet and makes using the pumice stone much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product. I have heard from some friends with high blood pressure that their doctors do not recommend using this product. You may want to contact your physician with the product information if you have any concerns. In order to offer my 100% honest opinion I was offered this item at discounted rate for the purpose of reviewing it. There was no further compensation involved.wing it. There was no further compensation involved.</li>
    <li> i received this order to test the product and write a review on it... I like this so much! it is a pain to make but other than that it works great. I used it on my face and it left my face feeling very soft after just one use. I cant wait to try it in my hair! the size of the container is great! you will get many uses out of it which is awesome!</li>
    <li> There are so many uses for bentonite clay and I was excited to receive mine to try it. I use mine mostly as a facial treatment while soaking in the tub but it can also be added to the bath as a detoxifying agent. Bentonite Clay is a unique clay due to its ability to produce an “electrical charge” when hydrated. Upon contact with fluid, its electrical components change, giving it the ability to absorb toxins. Bentonite removes toxins and impurities such as heavy metals and can be taken internally but make sure to check a wellness website to ensure proper use. You can even use it to make tooth powder. I recommend the Cosmetics Derigueur Bentonite Clay as it&#x27;s now a member of my beauty, health, and medicinal routine for the various benefits it provides.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Bentonite Healing Clay.  I was a little surprised when it came in as powder form.  It&#x27;s definitely all natural!  I LOVE that it smells all natural with no artificial additives.  I just use water to mix, the container suggests Apple Cider Vinegar.  It mixed well, and spread on the face easily.  It felt a little heavy on, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the GOOD STUFF!  My skin was noticably softer and smoother.  I use it once a week, and always look forward to my mud mask evening!  I recommend this product and will purchase again in the future!</li>
    <li> Very high quality bentonite clay. Finely ground. Wonderful for facials and making masks. I&#x27;ve never tried preparing it without stirring as directed on the container, but will be experimenting with this method to see how it differs.</li>
    <li> This really worked wonders on my face. I love how it helped with my acne and evened out my t-zone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! ! Leaves my face smooth and flawless</li>
    <li> Product helps soothe skin. My skin feels great after using.  Happy with product.</li>
    <li> I love this bentonite clay!  I have used it on my face several times and I got adventurous and decided to try it on my hair.  It worked great on my hair too!  It left my hair feeling cleaner than shampoo does but lighter.  I have a very slight natural curl in my hair and this left it a little bouncier.  I will be using only this from now on in place of shampoo!  I can&#x27;t wait to see all of the other ways I can use this clay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that wants instant results.  That is the only reason I&#x27;m rating this 4 stars instead of 5.  There is a 20 minute prep time.  However when I applied this to my face it did dry fairly quickly.  When I rinsed the clay off my face was so soft and smooth and that impressed me greatly.  My adult acne is already beginning to clear up after a week of use.  Reminder do not use a metal spoon to stir or the magnetic properties will be destroyed.  I will be buying this again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> After putting in water , the clay is hard to mix into a smooth creamy form, I have used similar products but this one is not my favorite, of course the result probably the same - deep cleansing.</li>
    <li> Pros- makes your skin smooth, you can feel it pulling the impurities to the surface, there is a lot in the container&lt;br /&gt;Cons-time consuming, messy, the instructions on the container call for way to much to be mixed (I ended up cutting the mixture down to about a fourth of what it called for and still had left overs after 2 facials)&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have enjoyed this product. It is my first experience with this type of mask, but I love that I can actually feel my face pulsating when it is drying. I have also seen an improvement in my skin tone since using this product. I had previously used another product that made my face flair up with break outs and this product seems to be helping the heeling process. The only reason i am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is due to it takes a while to mix up and it is pretty messy. I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Please, PLEASE test this product on your arm a full 24 hours before applying to your face. You can have serious allergic reactions to new products and a chemical burn on your face is no fun. This product seems to work for some but, unfortunately I suffered an allergic reaction to it and was not able to properly review this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> Great product. Made my skin soft!</li>
    <li> By far the best clay mask ever! My face feels so refreshed</li>
    <li> When I received this my daughter was visiting.  We had a facial mask party together.  Neither one of us had ever used a clay mask before so it was a fun time together.  I mixed up the clay according to the directions.  We put on or masks and waited.  When we washed off the masks we could not believe the way our skin felt.  It was wonderful.  I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My face felt so soft after I removed the mask and it was super easy to put on. My friend who has patches of eczema use it on her skin (didn&#x27;t leave on as long in the sensitive areas) and she loved it after! We even used it in our hair. She has curly hair and I have straight hair. Both of our hair felt super soft afterwards. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I used this over the weekend after shampooing my hair and it was very wonderful. I love how soft and strong my hair felt after applying and rinsing. It is a great add to my hair care regimen. I would definitely recommend others try this product.</li>
    <li> Cosmetics Deriguer Sodium Bentonite Clay Powder. I tried this as a facial mask and mixed according to directions with no contact with metal.&lt;br /&gt;The mask was a little difficult at first to apply to my skin as it was slightly slippery but I quickly got the hang of it and applied and even thin coat.  I let the mask stay on for a good 30 minutes then rinsed thoroughly ( I would highly recommend getting in the shower to rinse as it takes some time to reconstitute and remove) my skin felt really nice. velvety soft and clean and it does draw out impurities according to the literature.  I also had my daughter try this every other day for a week and saw good improvement on her acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> There is a bit of prep work and clean up time that goes into using this product. I used this last night and my skin feels great. If it&#x27;s just you and a friend, use half of what&#x27;s recommended on the directions or you will have a lot of left overs.</li>
    <li> I have been dying to try this bentonite healing clay mask - so when I had the chance to review it, I was SO excited. I used the apple cider vinegar with the product, and I decided to only leave it on the skin for 10 minutes at first, to see how my skin would react to it. It definitely made my skin red, but that dissipated within a few minutes of taking it off.. .and wow afterwards my skin felt like a DREAM. I&#x27;m super excited and can&#x27;t wait to keep using it!</li>
    <li> Being a diabetic, my dad always worries about me getting proper care. He knows that when I get sick or get a rash, it seems to stick with me longer than an average person. When I informed him that I have an opportunity to purchase an item at an amazing price that will not only help with healing cuts but also help with the acne I have due to being diabetic, he was very interested to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;Upon using the product, I am very pleased with the results and would highly recommend it to diabetics and non-diabetics alike. I mixed the product with Apple cider vinegar with Mothers (these are located with the organic items in the grocery store)&lt;br /&gt;I placed the product on my legs on a rash I had for 3 days. I&#x27;m still not sure what the rash was from but I did know that getting it to go away seemed to be a difficult task. However, the next morning, I could see a dramatic change from the day before. This is a product that I will be sure to keep stocked in my medicine cabinet and would encourage anyone reading this to do the same or to at least give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that locals spas offer clay mask treatments, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money as I thought it was too expensive. Then I was told that I could get Cosmetics Derigueur Bentonite Healing Clay at a great price and decided to finally try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read up on bentonite healing clay and learned that there are many benefits to using it. The main benefits include skin and hair detoxification, increased immunity and skin inflammation reduction. For me, I have black heads on my nose that never seem to go away. The pore strips I used previously were a decent temporary solution, but it wasn&#x27;t getting to the route of the problem. Eczema is another skin issue that I have. My hands are particular culprits, especially in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that this stuff is amazing! I followed the directions on the jar as instructed and put appropriate amounts of clay and water in a plastic container. Applying the clay on my face and hands was a breeze. I left it on my skin for the suggested 10 minutes. After removing the clay, my face felt clean and smooth. After a few more applications, my eczema has cleared significantly and the blackhead pores on my face are diminishing! I did not use this product on my color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion for anyone is to read the instructions in order to get the perfect combination of powder and water. This will ensure proper detoxification and an easy application. I recommend this to anyone who wants to see and feel an improvement with their skin!</li>
    <li> I have only used a face mask a few times so this is all new to me. A lot of my friends were telling me about the ingredient sodium bentonite in healing clay and how good it is for your face, so I was very anxious to order this and see how it worked. I opened the jar and I was surprised to see the contents look like powdered cement. I thought okay, let&#x27;s do this. I mixed up just 1/4 cup of the clay and 1/4 cup of water. I followed the instructions and after the time expired, I rinsed the clay off my face and toweled it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face was a little red but I kind of expected that. However, it felt renewed, clean and refreshed. I could tell that my face was thoroughly renewed and was glowing. The red went away after about a half hour. I was asked to test and review this item and give my honest opinion of it. I liked the idea of pulling the impurities off of my face. I highly recommend this product for anyone that wants to thoroughly clean and refresh their face.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel very smooth!  Great for using as a mask and looking forward to taking a mud bath with it as well!</li>
    <li> good product easy absorb</li>
    <li> this is an awesome product</li>
</ol>
