      <li>Such a wonderful scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I love these mixes of oils.</li>
      <li>Sandalwood is one of my favorite scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My favorite ingredients in this land is the Sandalwood.</li>
      <li>Refreshing citrus scent.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite blends and favorite companies.</li>
      <li>and I plan to buy more once I run out because its just fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love all of Plant Therapy&#x27;s synergys.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but the smell is light.</li>
      <li>Sandalwood is good for grounding and focus, black pepper is comforting and energizing, and lemon is great for lethargy and fatigue.  </li>
      <li>So I was incredibly excited when I fell in love with this oil</li>
      <li>That sounded like an odd combo to me but the scent is awesome.  </li>
      <li>It has helped me tremendously!</li>
      <li>Great addition to my essential oils collection.  </li>
      <li>I choose this because of the product, sandalwood scent, amount of oil and the free shipping.  </li>
      <li>this oil was okay, but just smelled like lemon, not the exciting sounding combination of lemon, pepper, and sandalwood.  </li>
      <li>This essential oil blend smells amazing!</li>
      <li>This essential oil blend smells amazing!</li>
      <li>It really seems to help perk me up especially first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>I like to call my self a connoisseur of essential oils because I like to collect the greatest essential oil as I can find.</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied with delivery, the product and all services especially with the scent and the oil!</li>
      <li>and my husband even liked it enough to give it a thumbs up!</li>
      <li>Overall, though, a good product with a lively scent.</li>
      <li>I have heard great things from friends about this brand and after trying several different oils from plant therapy I would have to agree.</li>
      <li>This was my first time trying a lemon, black-pepper and sandalwood blend</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it first thing in the morning in my diffuser</li>
      <li>The lemon brightens up the deep exotic sandalwood and pepper scents.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a great, subtle addition to my homemade deodorant.</li>
      <li>I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions, positive or otherwise and</li>
      <li>oil is certified 100% pure and contains no fillers or additives.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s extremely important for oils that I will be applying topically or using in my diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it really does make me focus.  </li>
      <li>My husband really like this one says it keeps him motivated.</li>
      <li>I just feel ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>After giving up traditional ADD medication, I&#x27;m constantly trying new products to improve my attention span and alertness, and this oil has definitely been a great aid in that.</li>
      <li>This particular blend helps to increase focus, alertness, and concentration.</li>
      <li>I normally will put some oil on the bottoms of my feet and it will start to feel it working in about 10 minutes or so.</li>
      <li>I love essential oils, but my husband is a lot more hesitant on a lot of the scents, and there are very few that he likes enough for me to run through my diffusers at home.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite oil, hands down!</li>
      <li>I also diffuse this in my home during cleaning time as an extra boost, and I find that it really helps!</li>
      <li>A blend of lemon, black pepper, and sandalwood, I really enjoy using it in my diffuser.</li>
      <li>Not too familiar with essential oils, this smelled good, but didn&#x27;t last as long as expected, which was reflected in other reviews.</li>
      <li>managed to snag a discount because they are currently switching their packaging and labeling so they have to deplete the old stock but even at the full price I totally recommend it</li>
      <li>I also tried it as a car scent, placing a couple drops on an old &amp;#34;pine tree&amp;#34; but it was a little too strong, and then completely disappeared within 3 hours in the summer heat.</li>
      <li>I like to use it in the diffuser near my desk when I&#x27;m working.</li>
      <li>The addition of pepper and lemon accent it very well to create a fragrance that I just can not get enough of!</li>
      <li>And since its so strong it will last just as long if not longer than those bigger bottles so</li>
      <li>oil comes in a small bottle, and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I’m surprised at just how well these three different oils work together in this blend, and I think the black pepper adds just the right kick to it.</li>
      <li>Lemon and sandalwood are two of my favorite essential oil scents, but having never smelled black pepper oil before I’d been a little concerned at what that would be like.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell and the main one that pops in the Lemon; the other oils in this blend are black pepper, and sandalwood.</li>

<li> The oil helps give them a little extra energy in the morning, and helps keep them focused on the things they need to get done in the morning.</li>
<li> I know that they say don&#x27;t use before bed time as you will be wide awake.</li>
<li> Was everything I expected.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product! Was everything I expected.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite oil, hands down! As a lover of all scents sandalwood, the aroma of this one is unsurpassed. The addition of pepper and lemon accent it very well to create a fragrance that I just can not get enough of! After giving up traditional ADD medication, I&#x27;m constantly trying new products to improve my attention span and alertness, and this oil has definitely been a great aid in that. I personally use this by adding a few drops to an unscented lotion and rub it in just as I would any other body lotion. It has helped me tremendously! My mood is instantly picked up, my attitude improved and I just feel alert and happy! I also diffuse this in my home during cleaning time as an extra boost, and I find that it really helps! As with all essential oils, quality is key to performance, and this oil is definitely an achiever in my book. Thanks Plant Therapy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discounted for evaluation</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the smell is light.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy are awesome.  This is one of my favorites,  gives me energy, and works awesome in my diffuser.  My husband really like this one says it keeps him motivated.</li>
    <li> I love all of Plant Therapy&#x27;s synergys.  This one is great too.  A mix of lemon, black pepper, and sandalwood, a great pick me up when you need it.  Great to use when sitting through long boring meetings.  A couple of drops in a personal diffuser and you are good to go.  Would also be great in a diffuser during those days that you just don&#x27;t feel like doing anything.</li>
    <li> Not too familiar with essential oils, this smelled good, but didn&#x27;t last as long as expected, which was reflected in other reviews.</li>
    <li> This essential oil blend smells amazing! I love essential oils, but my husband is a lot more hesitant on a lot of the scents, and there are very few that he likes enough for me to run through my diffusers at home. So I was incredibly excited when I fell in love with this oil and my husband even liked it enough to give it a thumbs up! This blend is made with lemon, black pepper and sandalwood oils. Lemon and sandalwood are two of my favorite essential oil scents, but having never smelled black pepper oil before I’d been a little concerned at what that would be like. Having smelt this blend now, my concerns about the black pepper were totally unwarranted! I’m surprised at just how well these three different oils work together in this blend, and I think the black pepper adds just the right kick to it. It really does make for an invigorating blend, and it’s a perfect oil to run through my diffuser at home to help keep me peppy during the day!

    <li> This synergy is great to help you wake up in the morning or for a pick me up in the afternoon. It smells very nice and fresh. This company has great oils and great customer service.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying a lemon, black-pepper and sandalwood blend and now I&#x27;m not entirely sure how I have gone this long without it! Such a wonderful scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it first thing in the morning in my diffuser and I&#x27;ve been taking the bottle with me to work to smell whenever I feel my energy lagging. It really seems to help perk me up especially first thing in the morning. I open my eyes and turn on the diffuser and close my eyes. While normally this would lead to me falling back asleep, within a few minutes I just feel ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of Plant Therapy because they provide some of the strongest oils I have ever come across. While some people would rather give you a 2oz bottle of low scent oil, plant therapy would rather give you the strongest oil they can and let you determine if you want to dilute it. And since its so strong it will last just as long if not longer than those bigger bottles so its a win win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed to snag a discount because they are currently switching their packaging and labeling so they have to deplete the old stock but even at the full price I totally recommend it and I plan to buy more once I run out because its just fantastic!</li>
    <li> This blend contains Sandalwood, Black Pepper and Lemon.  That sounded like an odd combo to me but the scent is awesome.  The lemon brightens up the deep exotic sandalwood and pepper scents.  Sandalwood is good for grounding and focus, black pepper is comforting and energizing, and lemon is great for lethargy and fatigue.  I use this in the diffuser while at my desk and it really does make me focus.  It smells great also and makes my house smell really good.  Love this blend!!

    <li> this oil was okay, but just smelled like lemon, not the exciting sounding combination of lemon, pepper, and sandalwood.  I&#x27;m a bing sandalwood fan and was hoping for a nice blend.  Oh well</li>
    <li> Invigor-Aid Synergy Essential Oil Blend&lt;br /&gt;I received the 10 ml bottle of plant therapies Invigor-Aid, the oil comes in a dark brown glass bottle, the oil is clear and i have attached a picture for reference. I really like the smell and the main one that pops in the Lemon; the other oils in this blend are black pepper, and sandalwood. I love all the citrus oil smells. This oil is for mental alertness and pep for that afternoon pick me up. I normally will put some oil on the bottoms of my feet and it will start to feel it working in about 10 minutes or so. I will also put this on my kid’s feet in the morning before school. The oil helps give them a little extra energy in the morning, and helps keep them focused on the things they need to get done in the morning. I have heard great things from friends about this brand and after trying several different oils from plant therapy I would have to agree. I would recommend any of the plant therapy oils to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt; I received this product for free/discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

    <li> I truly love this wonderful blend of oils. I like to call my self a connoisseur of essential oils because I like to collect the greatest essential oil as I can find. My favorite ingredients in this land is the Sandalwood. Sandalwood is one of my favorite scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil comes in a small bottle, and is easy to use.

    <li> you can tell the ratios may not be equal.  definitely a good blend though.  feel more invigorated with cardamom tho.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several different blends from this company, and my family and I enjoy them all!</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy does it again!  I love these mixes of oils. Especially since the mixes are some I would never think of.  This mix to invigorate is delightful to diffuse in my house. I love the wake-up call! I am a slug &amp; it takes me literally all day to be alert. This mix helps me get my wits about me quicker!  I have added it to lotion also. Please keep these scents coming! I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I was reading about this and thought I have some and I am going to try and use this. I know that they say don&#x27;t use before bed time as you will be wide awake. I said I am shot and need to finish the laundry and went down to finish the laundry and place a drop behind each ear. I said it is not going to do anything. I found in less than 5 minutes I had energy and felt wide awake. I then went and found the hubby and he was shot from being up all day and then gave him two drops also behind the ear. I can say that he was looking wide awake and stayed awake for a long time. Our sleep was all messed up from using this. I got the housework done and was so very happy. I will use this anytime I need to stay alert and need some pep. I have ordered a second bottle and may want a third. I am going to try this on my dad and see if this can help him with the ton of work that he is doing and is finding that hard to do. I will add that in less than one month from now. I need to get him some and he will try this on a weekend.</li>
    <li> Followed instructions, and it burned my skin, it turned red for days, then itched for awhile. Never used again, and will just toss it!</li>
    <li> I nNeeded it for the black only, but it works. Will order just black pepper next time, though, because it is for perfume.</li>
    <li> I have ordered from Plant Therapy Essential Oils before and have never been disappointed. The scents are always really great and as a massage therapist, my clients always give great feedback about them!</li>
    <li> My oldest child rubs this behind her ears and on her wrists every morning before school.  She loves the way it makes her feel.  And...don&#x27;t tell the hubby...but I used some as an air freshener in my kitchen and he has unknowingly been helping out in my kitchen more.  Yeah Man!!!!!</li>
